My plan was to spend a month in the capital of Texas , hoping this would give me a good amount of time to explore the city whose slogan is Keep Austin Weird ' . Even though this slogan had me suspect that I 'd love the city , I had no idea just how much I 'd fall for Austin . <p> With dozens of live music venues , excellent craft beer , countless food trucks , plenty of outdoors activities , especially along the river , and an overall laid-back attitude , the city won me over during my month there . <p> Because I had the advantage of being able to spend four full weeks there , I took my time to explore every nook and cranny of the city , but I know that most people come to Austin for a quick weekend getaway . And while I 've already shared 33 Things I Love About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overview of how to spend a weekend in Austin.Here is my perfect weekend in Austin for you " including places to eat and drink , what to do and what to see on a first-time visit : <p> Friday , 2pm : Welcome to Austin <p> Luckily , nearly all Austin hotels are conveniently located downtown , which makes it easy to explore the city on foot . If you 're not hugely into walking , I recommend you take advantage of Austin 's easy-to-use bike sharing system . The shared bikes , called B-Cycle , have a great Weekender Pass ' , which gives you three full days access to the bikes for only $15 and includes an unlimited number of free rides up to 60 minutes ( a 24-hour pass is $12 ) . <p> The best way to use the B-cycles is to download the free app " that way you have an overview of all available stations around town . <p> Start with a ride around Downtown to get your bearings : 6th Avenue is the main drag , especially at night , lined with cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue runs from the State Capitol all the way down to the Colorado River . Once you get to the river , follow the bike path alongside it . <p> If you turn left , you can ride all the way to Ladybird Lake and beyond ( go either until Frontage Road Bridge or Pleasant Valley Road Bridge , cross the bridge and circle back to Congress Avenue Bridge ) . If you turn right , you will get to Zilker Park and get superb views over the Downtown skyline . Stop at Doug Sahm Hill in Butler Park ( on the other side of the river ) for the best skyline views.If you do n't want to rent a bike , you can easily walk the same route , it will just take you a little longer . A good walk would be across the Congress Avenue Bridge , turning left on Roy and Ann Butler Hike &amp; Bike Trail , walking through Butler Park , crossing the river via the Lamar Street Pedestrian Bridge , and walking back to where you started on the north side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , venture a little further and try one of the tasty food trucks on Austin 's East Side , for example East Side King Thai Kun ( 1816 E 6th St ) , Micklewait Craft Meats ( BBQ meats ; 1309 Rosewood Av ) , or The Peached Tortilla ( banh mi tacos &amp; other Asian-fusion fare ; 5520 Burnet Rd #100 ) . Alternatively , head to the food truck park on S 1st Street and W Live Oak Street , where you find Venezuelan , Indian , Baja Mexican &amp; Japanese Fusion , and desserts . Vegans will love Arlo 's ( 900 Red River Street ) . <p> 5pm : A Stroll along South Congress <p> It is almost time to go out and explore Austin 's nightlife " start with a stroll over S Congress Ave Bridge , which connects Downtown with SoCo , short for South Congress , where you will find a number of independent shops , restaurants and bars , and some fantastic old-fashioned neon signs . <p> SoCo is the neighborhood to find some of Austin 's most eclectic shops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allens Boots ( with over 4,000 boots , definitely peek inside ! ) , Monkey See Monkey Do , and the Yard Dog gallery . If you have a sweet tooth , treat yourself to a cupcake at the Hey Cupcake food truck , to some ice cream at the famous Amy 's Ice Cream shop or stock up on candy at the epic Big Top Candy Shop . <p> There are some great murals down here as well " look out for the Willie Nelson mural and the I Love You So Much graffiti . G++eros Taco Bar is a good place for a sundowner margarita , and June 's is a wine bar with a nice patio.Make sure to walk back towards Congress Bridge in time for sunset , because that 's when between March and October Austin 's most unique and free show begins : the flight of the bats . <p> 7 8pm : The Flight of the Bats <p> Since 1980 , Mexican free-tailed bats have made their homes in the concrete crevasses of the bridge , and over 1 million bats fly out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle to see , especially considering you 're right in the heart of a big city . In fact , this bat colony is the largest urban bat colony in the world ! You can either watch the flight of the bats from the top of the bridge or from a big grassy spot near the river below . Be warned : This space fills up quickly . <p> 9pm : Bar-hopping along Historic Rainey Street <p> Just north of Congress Ave Bridge is Rainey Street , a street lined with historic bungalows that are now home to some of Austin 's trendiest bars . <p> You can either opt for a food truck dinner there are several on Rainey Street , for example : Art of Tacos , or the tasty Via 313 Pizza Truck behind Craft Pride , Boca inside the Container Bar , or Big Fat Greek Gyros or you could do a fancy dinner just around the corner from Rainey Street , at what is one of the hottest tickets in town these days : Geraldine 's , a contemporary gourmet restaurant inside the fabulous new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a fancy dinner at Geraldine 's , make sure to reserve well in advance . <p> End your first night in Austin by bar hopping until you ca n't keep your eyes open anymore . Places worth stopping at are Blackheart , Banger 's Beer Garden ( with over 100 beers on tap ) , Craft Pride and the Container Bar , which is made out of shipping containers . <p> Saturday , 9am : Brunch <p> There are several excellent brunch spots in Austin , but my favorite is 24 Diner ( 600 N Lamar ) which serves solid portions of all your brunch favorites and special treats like their sweet potato hash , or a waffle sandwich . Mimosas are only $3.95 and brunch cocktails start at $7 . If you have to wait in line ( which you most likely will , since it is the weekend ) , head to Waterloo Records a couple of doors down to check out some new releases . Waterloo is a great old fashioned vinyl store , which are hard to find these days ( but do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're a Whole Foods fanatic , you have to check out the Whole Foods flagship store after breakfast , which is located just across the street from 24 Diner . The 80,000 sq . ft market is more than just your regular Whole Foods " there 's a bar , a wine bar , an eatery , even a makeup counter . Plus a bunch of products that you can only get here . <p> 11am : Street Art Heaven <p> Hope Outdoor Gallery is just a couple of blocks from 24 Diner and is a vast outdoor graffiti park a must-see for street art lovers ! The colorful walls are the remainder of an abandoned building , and street artists are allowed to leave their mark here . It is basically an ever-changing outdoor gallery , and you 'll probably be able to see some artists at work during your visit . If you climb all the way up to the top of the hill ( the building ruins sit on the side of a hill ) you also get some nice views over Austin . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerd on : there are several top-notch museums ( Blanton Museum Of Art , Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum , The Contemporary Austin , Mexic-Arte Museum ) " pick the one that best fits your personal interests . The Guardian has a great overview of the 10 best museums in Austin , my personal favorites were the art museums . <p> And then there 's also the Texas State Capitol , an imposing red granite building that is only second in total size to the National Capitol in DC ( it is even 15 feet taller than the one in DC ! ) , which can be visited in a free half-hour guided tour ( note that the last tours on Saturdays start at 3.30pm ) . <p> 6pm : BBQ Dinner <p> Austin is famous for its BBQ scene and you have to try at least one barbecue joint on a visit to Austin . Franklin 's ( 900 E 11th St ) is the most famous one , but the notoriously long lines there can make it difficult to fit it into a short visit , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cesar Chavez St , Austin ) ; La Barbecue ( 1906 E Cesar Chavez St ) , Freedmen 's ( 2402 San Gabriel St ) ; Terry Black 's BBQ ( 1003 Barton Springs Rd ) ; Stiles Switch BBQ &amp; Brew ( 6610 N Lamar Blvd ) and Lambert 's Barbeque ( 2nd Street District ) . <p> 8pm : Sunset Drinks <p> For sunset drinks , head up to one of the rooftops . For great views and al-fresco cocktails , head to The Hangar Lounge ( 318 Colorado St ) , The Market &amp; Tap Room ( 319 Colorado St , Austin ) or The Handle Bar ( 121 E 5th St ) . <p> 9pm : Live Music <p> You ca n't visit Austin without getting a taste of its wonderful live music scene . Austin has something for everyone " country , rock , jazz or blues " whatever you 're into , pick up a TimeOut LONG ... and see who is playing where on the weekend you are in town . The Continental Club on South Congress is one of the most popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and The Broken Spoke is great for two-step , The White Horse for country and then there 's the Red River Music District with venues like Stubb 's , Mohawk and Cheap Charlie 's . <p> Note : If you want to take a free Texas two-step dance class at the Broken Spoke , skip the sunset drinks and head to the Broken Spoke around 8pm . Lessons take place Wednesdays to Saturdays from 8.30pm to 9.30pm . <p> 11pm : Drinks at a Speakeasy <p> If you are n't tired yet , hit up one of Austin 's excellent speakeasy bars . The Midnight Cowboy , right on 6th Street , is probably the most popular one , and getting inside without a reservation is impossible ( reserve a table online http : **29;0;TOOLONG ) . A solid and less crowded alternative is Garage which is located in a parking garage and has a large selection of delectable cocktails . <p> If you 're more in the mood for a full-on Tex-Mex breakfast , head to Curra 's Grill ( 614 E Oltorf St , Austin ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con huevo and other scrumptious Mexican-inspired breakfasts , plus a number of creative Tex-Mex style cocktails . Trudy 's Texas Star ( various locations ) is another solid option for migas , chilaquiles , huevos motulenos or other Tex-Mex breakfasts . Drinks are only $2.50 until noon and $4.50 after that ( until 4pm ) . <p> After your brunch feast , it is time to burn some calories . If you 've opted for a B-Cycle bike pass , take a bike and head to the river , where you can rent kayaks at Congress Kayaks ( $15 per hour ) . It is now time to get out on the river , and an hour kayaking can bring you all the way to Lady Bird Lake ( west ) or to Zilker Park ( east ) . <p> If kayaking is not cool enough for you , rent a stand-up paddle board at Live , Love , Paddle and paddle around Ladybird Lake ( $20 per hour ) . <p> Going out on the river was one of my favorite activities in Austin , and the views over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ladybird Lake , moving away from the Downtown buildings , you 'll notice how green Austin really is . <p> 12pm : A Walk in the Park/Pool Time ! <p> Finish your visit with a walk through Zilker Park , which , at 351-acres , is one of the biggest green spaces in Austin . If you are a fan of Botanical Gardens , it is well worth checking out the Zilker Botanical Gardens ( $3 ) . If you 're visiting during the summer months , pack your bathing suit and stop for a swim at the gorgeous Barton Springs pool , over three times longer than a football field- and fed by the Barton Spring , the fourth largest natural spring in Texas . ( $8 for non-residents , $3 for residents ) . <p> 2pm : Food Truck Time <p> After your swim or walk in the park , treat yourself to one last food truck meal before heading to the airport . Within walking distance from Zilker Park are the amazing sandwich truck Hey ! You Gon na Eat or What ? , The Mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Kebabalicious ( all three are located in 1720 Barton Springs Rd ) . 129333 @qwx989333 <p> If you 're on a budget , take advantage of bus No 100 which brings you Downtown from the airport in less than half an hour for only $1.75 ( you 'll need exact change ) . A taxi , in comparison , is around $30 . <p> The best way to get around if you do n't have a car and do n't want to rely on car sharing services is the B-cycle bike sharing program . <p> Austin 's public transportation system is pretty decent though , and a 24-hour bus pass is only $2.50 ( a single ride is $1.25 ) . <p> GoogleMaps directions worked well to show me bus routes and schedules , but you can also download the CapMetro app for the most accurate information and to buy tickets via the app . <h> PIN IT ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142813 @2542813/ <p> We covered the experience of the visit to the Falls , like most travel publications tend to do . After all , that 's why we all go up to this corner of the jungle . <p> But no one talks about what the actual trip there is like . So today we are talking about the things that nobody tells you about your trip to Iguazu Falls : <h> It is not cheap or easy to visit Iguazu Falls . <p> Iguazu Falls are located on the border between Brazil and Argentina , out of the way of any other destination in either country. - The only way the falls can be on the way anywhere is if you happen to be traveling overland through Paraguay ( which most people are n't ) . So likely you 're detouring to make a special trip here . <p> In total , we spent $1,000 for a four-day trip , traveling by buses and staying in the cheapest hostel we could find available . Here 's how : <p> Getting there is expensive . Buses are your cheapest option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the closest biggest cities , are both just under 16 hours away by bus . From Buenos Aires it is a full 24-hour bus ride , and our trip from Rosario was 20 hours and cost ARS480 , or $95 US dollars per ticket and our onward journey Puerto Iguazu to Salta was another ARS590 , or $115 per person . <p> This is one of the world 's major natural wonders , so there is obviously an airport . Buenos Aires is a two-hour flight , but flights are normally around $350 one way . <p> Hotels and hostels have inflated rates , and even places with mediocre reviews are overpriced and quickly booked . We paid ARS245 / $48 , for a double room in giant , mediocre hostel with carpet that may have not been vacuumed in years . Unless you are on a shoestring budget , we would recommend to choose a place with better reviews , but that will bump you up to more per night . <p> Iguazu Falls admission rates are another extra cost on top . Per person we paid ARS60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus ARS170 / $34 entrance and another ARS150 / US$30 for the boat ride " which we really recommend doing , too . So that is $76 total per person , plus Dani paid BRZ41.66 / $21 admission to visit the Brazilian side of the Falls , plus ARS8 / $1.60 for the bus to the border and ARS12 / US$2.40 ( each way ) from the border to the Falls . <p> In total , the actual visit to the Falls cost us $181 , and would have cost $210 had Jess come to the Brazilian side ( plus an extra $140 for a 90-day visa that U.S. citizens must pay ) . <p> Our tip : Do n't leave planning to the last minute . Booked in advance , a return flight from Buenos Aires could have cost under $400 " twice the price of a bus ticket , but saving you two entire days of your life on a not very comfortable bus . Another great option to save money is booking in advance a complete tour package with a local travel agency from Argentina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paraguay , a UNESCO World Heritage site , while you are in the area . It 's just a two hour trip from Puerto Iguazu , Argentina . <h> Puerto Iguazu is a dump <p> Considering that Puerto Iguazu is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Argentina , the town leaves much to be desired . <p> Other popular tourist towns in Argentina " Bariloche , Cafayate , El Calafate , Ushuaia , are solid cities . They have great infrastructure for tourism and in general felt on par with similar places in Europe or the U.S. Puerto Iguazu feels much more like a developing country , only restaurants and souvenir shops line the streets , most hotels are in urgent need of renovation , and there were many child beggars walking barefoot from table to table all day throughout town.Ourtip : Try to find a good deal for a nicer hotel on Booking.com or a hostel with excellent ratings on Hostelbookers , and book well in advance . Splurge at some of the nicer restaurants " we loved La Rueda , an upscale restaurant on Avenida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the Falls ! <p> Sure , the Falls are why we are all here and are by the far the most stunning aspect of your trip to the park . But you rarely hear about the coatis ( a raccoon-like animal ) that feel like the true main attraction . From the minute you pass through the gates , you 'll be met by dozens of coatis roaming freely . <p> Tourists are constantly snapping pictures of them , possibly more than of the Falls . They kneel down and get so close to them " but do n't be fooled . These buggers BITE . They steal food , rummage through bags and depending on how many there are " they can get rather aggressive . There are very large , very graphic warning signs showing what a coati bite looks like , but in true tourist mode , people from around the world still get frightening close to them , feed them or even pet them ! <p> Our tip : Do n't feed the coatis and keep a safe distance if you do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are likely to bite you . <h> The nature around the Falls is spectacular . <p> Staring at the Falls for hours , getting lost in imagining all that water rushing by your eyes every second " that 's the core reason you visit Iguazu Falls . But the wildlife here is amazing , and more than almost anything else , we 'll remember the butterflies , hundreds of them , fluttering around us as we wandered along the trails and through the gorgeous jungle here . There are colorful birds , huge catfish in the river , crocodiles , those pesky coatis and monkey and jaguars , ( albeit the last two we did n't personally see ) . <p> Our tip : Take some time for a picnic " bring your own food , as the food in the park is overpriced and lackluster " and really take in the jungle scenery as well , not only the Falls . <h> The National Park is huge ! <p> While the Brazilian side is pretty manageable with only one walkway ( 1.2 km long / 0.75 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much bigger than we expected . While you can see Niagara Falls easily in a couple of hours , you can wander the walkways at Iguazu Falls for hours and hours . The upper trail , the lower trail , the trail on St Martin 's Island , the trail to the Devil 's Throat . If you 're also planning to take a boat ride , you can easily spend six hours in the park , especially as the little train ride from the entrance to the first set of trails takes a while , as does the train ride to the Devil 's Throat ( Garganta Del Diablo ) . <p> Our tip : Plan at least half a day for your visit to make sure you have enough time to walk all the trails , and have time to take in the falls from all the viewing platforms . We would n't advise to attempt seeing the Brazilian side and the Argentine side in one day . <h> The weather is iffy . <p> Iguazu Falls are in a tropical region and it rains . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can rain hard for a few hours or a whole day . We saw plenty of package tourists trucking it out to the Falls the first two days we were in town because they had their one day and it was time to move on . <p> Our tip:Err on the side of unpredictable tropical weather and give yourself a couple of days ' leeway so you can opt to go on the sunniest day possible . Trust us , the sun sparkling off the water , countless rainbows and all those butterflies make waiting a day or two totally worth it . <p> Still looking for a place to stay in Puerto Iguazu ? 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 103 Comments <h> Comment navigation <p> We spent 7 months in South &amp; Central America last year and read I do n't  know how many blogs and books . This is one of my favorite posts . Iguazu was early on in our adventures and we 'd been wondering if places were actually kind of dumpy or if we were being snobs . We read your blog , spent a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some places are kind of gross " and you were spot on with the rest of your tips too . Its not often that bloggers are so dang accurate . Nicely done ! <p> Hi ! Just visited ( Jan 2016 ) both side of falls and the entrancefees and bustickets are nowadays double than 2013 . Argentina side entrance was 300 pesos and bus ticket from busstation to back was 130 pesos . Entrance fee to Brazil side was 63,50 reales . <p> 2017 update : travelling in the last days of July/ first days of August you can get airfare for as cheap as US$135 from Buenos Aires to Puerto Iguazu with LATAM or Aerolineas Argentinas . The fee for the National Park for tourists from outside of Mercosur is AR$500 , for residents of countries within Mercosur its AR$400 and AR$260 for argentinian residents . Hope this is helpful = <p> Hi . I am planing a trip to the Falls within a 5- wk Brazilian trek , including Joao Pessoa , Salvador , Rio , and likely Paraty . Thinking of doing the Falls first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joao . For the Falls , Do you think it better to stay on the Argentinian side , or Brazilian ? Does one need visas to go back and forth ? Based on your blog , I am leaning towards full day guided tour of the Argentinian side with a boat trip , then half day self- guided on Brazilian side , plus half day at Bird sanctuary . Regards , and thanks , john <p> I stayed on the Argentinian side but did n't  love it maybe the Brazilian side has better accommodation options ? And yes , you do need a visa US citizens used to have to pay $160 ( reciprocity visa fee ) but I know it was suspended last year for a while .. not sure if it still is ? I was glad that I did both though while Brazil was great for panoramic vistas , you could n't get as close to the big waterfalls there as you could on the Argentinian side . <h> Comment navigation 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142814 @2542814/ <h> Chasing waterfalls in Minca , Colombia <p> Minca was n't in my original travel plans for Colombia , but as we were leaving Cartagena for Santa Marta , one of my Instagram followers remarked that I had to visit Minca . I had never even heard of Minca but a quick Google search revealed that it was a small mountain village close to Santa Marta . The pictures looked lovely , travelers were talking about waterfall hikes , good vegetarian food , local coffee farms , and a giant hammock with mountain views that 's all we needed to hear to convince us to make the detour . Plus : Cooler temperatures would be welcome after Santa Marta , which seemed to be even hotter and more humid than Cartagena.The ride to Minca was quick " within an hour of driving up a winding mountain road we found ourselves in the village , and within another hour , we had explored it entirely yes , that 's how small it is . <p> Views of Santa Marta from Minca <p> The chillier weather that had been mentioned was an illusion : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing : we grabbed our swimsuits and started the hike to the first of two waterfalls I wanted to visit , both of which were within walking distance of the village ( but in different directions ) . The first waterfall , Pozo Azul , is a two-tiered waterfall an hour uphill on the mountain road that would later bring us to Finca Victoria , the largest coffee plantation in the region . <p> I had read that you could jump from the upper waterfall into the pool below , and that 's what I wanted to do but I did n't  . Once we got there , it was n't all that hot anymore and the water was freezing . There was no way that I was going to jump in there ! Instead , I watched everybody else who dared to jump having fun in the waterfalls while befriending the local stray dogs.On the way back , we stopped at a local waterhole where they were selling local brews from the nearby Sierra Nevada brewery an excellent way to finish the hike and to enjoy the mountain views.The next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our biggest hike I wanted to hike all the way up the mountain top to Casa Elemento , a hostel that is famous for its giant hammock and splendid mountain vistas . On the way there we were going to stop at the Marinka waterfalls . After an hour-long , sweaty hike , we finally arrived at the waterfalls and cooled off . Like in Pozo Azul , there are two pools there , but much less people ( and no place to jump ) . After the refreshing break we decided that instead of walking up , it might be a better idea to hop on a moto taxi there are no real taxis here , only motorbikes and walk back down into town instead of walking uphill.And after a 25-minute ride up the hill , I was glad that we made this decision Casa Elemento was much further than I had thought ! Another traveler later told me that he had walked up there with his backpack " and that it took him three hours . We paid COP10,000 ( around US$3.40 ) for a day pass which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use of the pool and entry to the attached Jungle Town , where the hostel offers tree-top tours.Casa Elemento sure is n't lying when they say they have amazing mountain views I couldve spent all day in the giant hammock , and it was actually a bummer that we missed the sunset from up there.The hostel seemed to be a fantastic place to get away from it all : no wifi , nothing nearby , just nature , hammocks , and socializing with other travelers . <p> It took us three hours to get back to Minca , but it was definitely worth it , and the lovely dinner at the Lazy Cat ( you 'll find yourself eating there often if you visit Minca , trust me ) was well deserved.We had one more day in Minca , and we had one thing left to do : a visit to the Victoria coffee plantation . Both of us are coffee lovers , so this was going to be a highlight of our trip to Minca , and even though I 'd already been to a coffee plantation in Guatemala , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The over one hundred year old machines that are still used there are impressive , and seeing what a coffee picker makes per kilo was astonishing : <p> 14 Kg " 5,000 COP ( around US$1.70 ) <p> 28 kg " 10,000 COP ( around US$3.40 ) <p> 48 kg " 20,000 COP ( around US$6.80 ) <p> We were shown the entire process from the harvest of the coffee beans to fermentation , drying and finally the packing of the beans into giant sacks . Those are exported , sold for COP3,000 a kilo , which is about US$1 " so cheap ! Our guide reaffirmed what I had already experienced in Costa Rica , Honduras and Guatemala : the good stuff goes overseas , and what 's left in the country leaves a lot to be desired . The only decent coffee I had found in Colombia so far was the one at the Juan Valdez stores , Colombias answer to Starbucks , and a little coffee shop in Cartagena , San Alberto . <p> All this land belongs to La Finca Victoria . Its hard to see but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with coffee beans , we left Minca with big smiles on our faces to return to sea level : it was time for more beaches . This unplanned detour did n't just turn out to be well worth it , it also became one of the highlights of my time in Colombia . 129333 @qwx989333 <p> Important : <p> In 2016 during my visit there was no ATM in Minca , so bring enough cash . <h> How to get there <p> Shared taxis leave from Santa Marta as soon as they are full and cost COP8,000 ( US$2.70 ) <h> Where to stay <p> Our first choice for accommodation , Casa Loma , a treehouse-style hostel with several rooms , was sadly fully booked ( the room we wanted , El Mirador , was booked for the next four weeks ! ) , so make sure you book a hostel in advance , especially when you travel between December and February . <p> If Casa Loma is fully booked , or you do n't want to deal with the steep climb up to the hostel with your bags , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with excellent ratings ) : <p> And then there 's of course Casa Elemento high up in the mountains above Minca ( around 30 mins on a moto taxi ) . <p> The hotel we ended up staying at , La Casona , was n't anything special , but their bird watching terrace is fabulous <h> What to do in Minca <p> Walk to Marinka waterfalls : <p> Turn right after the bridge , walk past the church and then follow the road until you see the sign for Marinka Waterfalls .

For my second island hopping tour I had chosen tour C after having heard mixed reviews about this one from other travelers who had done Tour C a couple of days earlier , I had shortly contemplated hopping on tour B ( caves ) or D ( beaches ) instead , but then C still looked the most interesting ( there are photos of all the stops of each tour in the travel agencies around town ) and the mixed reviews had resulted from a spell of bad weather that caused the boats to take another route and skip some of the best stops.By the time I boarded the boat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bright blue skies and lots of sun .

But finding this little hidden oasis on the other side of the rocks made it totally worth it.The next stop was a bit creepy an abandoned catholic shrine built by a German guy who had married a Filipina , but in 2007 it was suddenly abandoned . Since then , people can visit the island and the various shrines , some of which are inside little caves . Even though the island felt a bit sinister to me , the vistas from a high up viewpoint were stunning.Our last stop for the day was star fish beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another great snorkeling experience with colorful fish , coral and crystal clear water.We were all still on a high from the marine life wed just seen when we hit the open sea to return to El Nido and were hit by huge waves that got us soaked within minutes . Luckily we were able to put our belongings below deck , safe from the water , otherwise phones and cameras would have gotten soaked as well.Note : The stops on tour C were much further out in the open water than the stops in tour A. If you are trying to decide between those two tours and you get seasick easily , I recommend joining tour A. The waves on the stretch between stop 1 and 2 and between stop 5 and returning to El Nido were crazy high ; I felt like I was on a roller coaster ride .. a really bumpy one.As soon as El Nido came into sight , I felt a wave of sadness come over me . My time at my last stop in the Philippines was coming to an end , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to hop on a plane back to Manila . I wished I had n't  booked my flight yet ( but after the expensive lesson my short-term planning had taught me , I had no choice ) so that I 'd be able to visit Port Barton , another beach on Palawan everyone was raving about , or tour the underground river near Puerto Princesa , Palawans UNESCO site . But not having visited these places yet means I have a reason to go back to Palawan one day . <h> My travel tips for visiting El Nido : <h> How to get to El Nido <p> There is only a small airport near El Nido Town which caters mainly to the guests of the pricey , exquisite resorts on the islands around El Nido . If money does n't  play a role I recommend flying straight into this airport , since itll save you the 5-6 hour van ride from Puerto Princesa up to El Nido ( via winding roads ) . There are three daily flights from Manila , one way is PHP6,750 ( US$151 ) . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palawan is in Puerto Princesa , between 5 and 8 hours south of El Nido , depending on which mode of transportation you choose . <p> As soon as you exit the airport in Puerto Princesa , you 'll be welcomed by a bunch of yelling guys , all holding El Nido signs , trying to sell you their minivan services . I had read that it was considerably faster than the public bus which takes 7 to 8 hours ( because it stops for passengers everywhere along the way ) , and so I followed the next best guy to his little office , where they sold me a return ticket for PHP1,000 ( US$22.50 ) . The ride took 5 hours , but I frequently thought I might lose my life as the driver sped through the narrow , winding mountain roads , accelerating before every hair needle curve . I thought about taking the bus back , which is only about $2 cheaper , but when I heard a girl whod taken it saying those were the most horrid 8 hours of her life , I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver drove more responsible than on my way there . <h> Where to stay : - <p> I ended up at the OMP hostel by chance , and was forced to look at some other places the next day when the hostel was fully booked . Let 's just say that all the places I looked at were not pretty . Lonely Planet hits the nail on the head with its description of the accommodation situation in El Nido : <p> El Nidos budget accommodation is generally substandard ( do n't  expect toilet seats ) , so consider splashing out on the mid-range hotels that line El Nidos beach west of the pier.Later on I noticed that the further away from the beach you venture to find a hostel , the better the quality of the rooms , and the cheaper they get . There are lots of guest houses and hotels south of town towards Coron-Coron Beach.I would recommend that if you 're a couple and do n't  care too much about going out and socializing at night , stay further away from the town . If you 're a solo traveler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , stay in town close to the beach . <p> Would I recommend OMP ? <p> Yes , but be aware that rooms are pretty basic . The single room with fan is the same price as a 6-bed dorm ( PHP600/US$13.50 ) , including breakfast , WiFi , free drinking water and discounted island tours ( I paid PHP200/300 less than the advertised price for each tour I booked through them ) . You 'll definitely meet people here , there 's hot water at all times ( and good water pressure ! ) and its centrally located . The staff is very friendly overall , a good hostel even though some of the dorms seemed cramped . It was pretty much always fully booked , so if you 'd like to stay here , make sure to book in advance . Take a look at the rooms here . <h> Where to eat &amp; drink : <p> The happening place each and every night was the Reggae Bar right at the beach . The other busy spot is the hookah bar . <p> CasaAzul is now the place with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , falafel burger , hummus and falafel plates . <p> Delinido is a little coffee shop with decent coffee and had the most reliable WiFi . <p> I found the Art Cafe , that everybodys raving about , pretty pricey and only had breakfast there , so ca n't really say how the rest of their food is . <p> v and v bagel is another popular breakfast spot , and the Mexican restaurant Carabao Lounge a few doors down also has plenty of breakfast options but the reviews ( by Americans ) I read about their Mexican food kept me from dining there . <p> The best deal for breakfast in town is Austria , a guesthouse that offers a breakfast buffet for only 99PHP ( US$2.23 ) . <h> What to do <p> Tour the islands <p> Definitely take one of the island hopping tours the islands are what El Nido really is about . If you 're strapped for time ( and money ) , there 's a combo tour of A and C for PHP1,500 Pesos ( US$33.75 ) . I thought it would include the best of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that it actually included ALL stops of both tours , just at a much faster pace.Visit other beaches <p> The beach in El Nido town is not the prettiest ( and cleanest ) and you cant even watch the sunset from here . Luckily there are other nearby beaches that are beautiful and better for sunset watching , such as Coron-Coron ( about 10 min by tricycle from town ) , Las Caba+as beach ( 15 min tricycle ride from town ) and sunset beach ( 20 mins from town ) . All of the beaches have beach bars that serve snacks and drinks.Climb , kayak or zipline <p> El Nido has a number of other activities to offer , such as diving , ziplining , wall climbing and kayaking you can easily spend a week here and not get bored ( just bring enough cash see below ! ) . Bring enough cash ! <p> All of the above activities require cash . There is one cash machine in town that gives cash advances , but at a hefty 10% fee . Make sure to take out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATM is about five hours away . My van transfer from Puerto Princesa included a stop at an ATM for this precise reason . I met quite a few people who would have stayed longer had they not run out of cash so bring more than you think you 'll spend to be on the safe side.Id calculate 200 pesos for a cheap meal and 400 pesos for a pricier meal ( pizza and a beer came to 420 pesos , breakfast usually cost me around 250 pesos in El Nido ) . The food available in the little stores around town was very limited , if you 're planning to self-cater . <p> Have you been to El Nido ? Feel free to add any tips you might have ( including decent places to stay ! ) in the comments below ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 14 Comments <p> Oh , this brings back so many wonderful memories for me ! That swim to the rock and a hidden lagoon on Tour C was a good one be glad yours did n't  involve jellyfish . I was traveling with someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cottage for 800PHP/night . Little bungalows set back from the main road ( ours had two beds ) , walking distance to town but far enough out to be a little quieter . We found it easy to meet other people staying there as each bungalow has an outdoor area facing the central " courtyard .

WiFi reached into our bungalow but apparently does n't  make it to all . Simple but good for the price for two people . Next time , definitely get to Port Barton , its beautiful , peaceful , and all-around excellent ! <p> Aaah I cant even imagine what it would have been like with jellyfish there ! : O Cliffside Cottage was recommended to me , btw , but they were already full .

I felt safer in a tuk tuk in Bangkok than I did in most taxis . Part of the adventure , I guess ( at least , that 's what I told myself as I frantically searched for seat belts ! ) It was a relief to find that in Singapore there are traffic lights and drivers stay in their lanes . It actually felt strange after 2 months of insanity . But some of the taxi drivers were real characters . Several became tour guides and they all had very interesting stories and good information for this American girl on her first extended trip in a very foreign place . I 'm sure you 've met some interesting taxi drivers . . . might be good content for a blog post sometime ! <p> Thanks so much , Laurel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that deserve a blog post ! I always feel like I am signing my life over to some lunatic when I 'm in South East Asia and take public transportation , no matter if its a tuktuk , a taxi or a scooter ( scooter taxis in Bangkok are INSANE ! ) . I do n't  know how there are n't  more accidents but somehow it all works out in the end ! Glad you had a good time during your first extended trip abroad , despite all the craziness of SEA = <p> Your photos are fantastic ! Definitely have visiting Philippine beaches on my list . Love the practical info ! You answer those little but important questions ( i.e. limited food selection if you are looking to self-cater ) that can be tough to find answers to when planning . Thanks for sharing ! <p> So glad to have found your site ! I am currently planning my trip to the Philippines and am trying to decide whether or not to include Palawan . I have already be to Bai Tu Long Bay in Vietnam and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you think they are quite similar or is El Nido worth the extra travel time . Thanks for any advice !

You wo n't regret it = <p> Was researching more about El Nido when I get to see your page . Excellent article written ! I did n't  know that there is an option to fly straight to El Nido from Manilla . I have promised my wife that we will be going to a beach for our next trip , and Eli Nido is our top choice at the moment . <p> Anyway , I have recently published an article on top honeymoon beaches from Singapore , and have added this article as one of the resources .

@@107142816 @2542816/ <p> But who would have thought Uruguay would remind us more of Cuba at times than Argentina ! It sure did , though , with thousands of gorgeous vintage cars rolling through the streets like a moving antique car fair or open air automobile museum . <p> In North America in the summer , you 'll often come across vintage car shows , with dedicated owners waxing and relaxing while onlookers admire and consider paying large sums of money to pick up their own vintage car . In Uruguay , the roads themselves are the car show , driven by regular janes and joes who have had these cars in their families for generations . <p> There is just something so perfectly fitting about these cars that represents the overall feeling of life in Uruguay proud , timeworn , defiant , dignified and adorably dilapidated . <p> While some cars definitely look used and abused , many are as pristine as in their heyday . There is a sense of nostalgia overload with these gorgeous old-timers parked along the streets of villages that also appear unchanged since the cars first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was during this era that Uruguay experienced a major economic upturn , exporting beef and wheat to sustain Europe throughout both World Wars . With money lining their pockets , Uruguayans proudly began opting for more expensive imported cars , and not just for special ocassions or the very rich . Imported Rolls Royces and Bugattis were even used to make deliveries or left to rust on the side of the road in favor of the latest model . <p> That is , until the economy completely crashed in the 1960s and car imports stopped almost entirely . Uruguayans maintained their love of cars and began preserving their cars to last for decades , and even have a special word for these cars now cachilas . <p> These cachilas have been passed on to sons and daughters , who passed them on to their sons and daughters , many of whom are still driving them around today . Those cars that do n't  run are often still shown love , re-purposed as artistic displays , like many of the cars we saw in Colonia del Sacramento . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the El Drugstore restaurant : a 1930s Citro+n sprouting trees and flowers and a 1920s Ford Model T , which has been remodeled into a dining car , for diners to eat at a little table inside the car . <p> It did n't  take long for word to get out about Uruguays vintage vehicles and in the 1970s , collectors from as far as Japan , Europe and North America flocked to Uruguay looking for rare models at much lower prices . <p> The cars of Uruguay , while vintage , can not really be considered antiques . These are living , breathing automobiles that have been consistently in use for over 60 years now . Antique might however be a word used to describe the mechanics who so lovingly restore them . Essentially car historians themselves , the older generation of mechanics have been pouring their hearts in the cars of Uruguay for decades . <p> The mechanics teach the younger generations the steps to repair the cars , but swear that only the older mechanics can truly keep the vintage cars in tact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanics who have so long loved them ? <p> Vintage cars have a very special place for everyone in the country , so much so that they are declared by the government to be historic patrimony .

@@107142817 @2542817/ <h> From Europe to the U.S. on a Budget Airline : My Experience with Norwegian Airs 787 Dreamliner <p> I have to admit that when I had agreed to give Norwegians transatlantic Dreamliner Experience a try , I was a bit skeptical . A budget airline that offers transatlantic flights ? What were these flights going to be like ? Memories of budget flights I had taken within Europe with a certain Irish budget airline ( whose crazy CEO had suggested standing room on flights a while back ) popped into my head . Memories that included throwing a fit over a fee for not having printed my boarding pass ( a fee that was more expensive than the ticket itself ) . Memories of radio commercials for said airline playing so loud from the speakers on the plane that you were barely able to hear your own voice . The list could go on , but let 's not go there.Of course I have not only had horrible experiences with budget airlines . I still treasure the memories of countless AirAsia flights which were all smooth and painless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plus , I was highly impressed that an airline was finally offering flights from Europe to the U.S. at an affordable rate . Prices for a flight from Stockholm to San Francisco start at an incredible $187 , and flights from London to New York start at $249 ( Note : London NYC seems downright expensive compared to the Stockholm San Francisco route , but that is because the airport fees in both London Gatwick and New York JFK are among the highest in the world . Stockholm NYC flights start at $158 , Oslo NYC at $167 ) . Not all seats are sold at these rates , but if you are planning a trip well in advance , it is possible to snag one of these amazingly cheap tickets.I am familiar with this concept thanks to train , bus and European air travel : the earlier you book , the cheaper the tickets are . With Norwegian though , I was surprised to see that less than a week prior to my flight from Berlin to London , from where Norwegian runs its transatlantic flights ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  only come up as the cheapest option in my flight search , but still offered flights for 29 Euros , as I had seen advertised in some magazines and at the airport in Berlin from where I 'd flown to Israel the month before . I was happy to see that I did n't  necessarily have to plan my trip months in advance to get a great deal like this , but could still spontaneously book a flight at that cheap rate five days prior to my departure.My next moment of joy was when I discovered that I did n't  need to print a boarding pass , and that I would n't have to fear a fine for not having a physical print-out , instead , I did n't  even need to present my booking confirmation on my smartphone my passport was enough . <p> Before I got on the plane , I was a bit worried that the planes would have rows as narrow as Ryanairs , where the pockets on the back of the seats ( to store your magazines and other stuff ) are missing , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . I can tolerate no leg room ( I am 5.7 ' and have long legs ) for a two hour flight , but not for seven or eight hours . I also was n't sure what to expect entertainment-wise , knowing that most other low cost carriers do n't  even have monitors. - <h> Check out my short video : What 's it like to fly Norwegian Air ? <p> I had read though that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was one of the most modern planes out there if not the most modern one . From extra large windows for better views , plus a button to darken the window should the sun disturb you ( instead of window shades ) , an automatic dimming light system that changes according to the time of day or night , better ( ie. lower ) cabin air pressure which is supposed to reduce jet lag , power outlets and a USB charger . And the environmentalist in me was happy to find out that the Boeing 787 is the most fuel efficient airplane on the market . The Dreamliner itself sounds amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my expectations and all of my worries were unfounded : Legroom in the plane was spacious , there was room to store a book in the backseat pocket , and each seat has its own TV screen . In fact , the thing that impressed me most was the entertainment selection on my flight . Even the music selection , which I usually ignore , had plenty of albums that I wanted to listen to , and ranged from billboard chart topping hits , to classics , to a whole bunch of jazz and classical music . My flight was n't even long enough to listen to all the albums that sparked my interest , and I had n't  even checked out the movies and TV shows yet . If you are planning to take the eleven hour direct flight from Copenhagen to Los Angeles , do not fear : there are enough Hollywood Blockbusters and Classics to keep you entertained for the entire length of the flight ( and back ! ) . <p> The snack bar , also accessible via the 9 ' high-tech touch-screen monitor , allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you desire , and it will then be brought to you shortly after . Prices are n't  cheap $11 for a sandwich , $4 for a chocolate bar but that is to be expected . You can , however , order a full hot meal when booking your flight ( more on that below ) . The other thing that I absolutely loved was that I did n't  only have a USB charger ( most planes have them these days ) , but also a power outlet on the side of my seat to charge my laptop . I made use of both of them a lot and being able to work on my laptop without it running out of battery was a huge plus for me . <p> You 're also able to purchase accessories like a blanket ( $5 ) or a headset ( $3 ) for some people it might be annoying having to pay for these things but let 's not forget that Norwegian has to cut its costs somewhere to be able to offer their incredibly low fares , and I for example used my own headphones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already included , as are the meals.Speaking of meals : This is the only aspect of the flight where I see room for improvement . Even the flight attendant looked apologetic when she handed me my pre-paid vegetarian meal , offering me to add some fish , because it looked quite meager . Considering that the extra cost for a meal is n't insignificant , I 'd expect a little more here . Other than that , I did n't  find anything to complain about during the flight like I said , the Dreamliner itself and the service on board were faultless . <p> Norwegian Air being a budget airline , I was curious to see how much the extra charges , or hidden fees would add up to . The first time you come across potential additional charges is when you choose your fare and start the reservation process . Here it actually pays off to read the fine print : Norwegian gives you the chance to pay an additional $60 to the basic fare ( LowFare ) , but for that , you 'll get a seat reservation , one piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to stick to the Lowfare to see how much extras would add up to . Checked luggage is charged at $42 , and if I 'd like to reserve a window seat ( or any seat , but why would I want to reserve a middle seat ? ) , that would be another $42 . Now my total was already at $382.20 which , in a way , already contradicts the budget aspect . However : Let 's not forget that I was looking at a flight two weeks from now . <p> With an added vegetarian meal though , the price comes to $417.20 , which is pretty steep . Remember though that Norwegian had given me the option to choose a better fare option , the Low Fare + , which includes all these add-ons and is $357.20 . The last step to confirm my reservation : Making the payment . If you 've ever taken a budget airline , you know that they charge an extra fee for payments made with a credit card . Norwegian is no different , but at least it is possible to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debit card . Since I do n't  own a credit card that does n't  have to be paid off entirely the next month anyway , I am fine with putting the payment on my debit card , but I know that most people prefer credit card payments . However , a 1.99% credit card surcharge is not outrageous.If you were to pay your ticket with a credit card and you opted for the Low Fare+ , this would come to $364.20 . So if you are one of these travel types I admire who travel only with carry-on only , do n't  care about a seat reservation and survive on a New York bagel bought before boarding the plane in NYC , you can get away with the Low Fare ticket , which comes to $304.30 with the credit card surcharge.What I discovered when I was going to finish my reservation was the little box saying Need More Time ? , offering me a 4-hour money back guarantee should I decide to cancel my ticket within the next four hours . That way , travelers can reserve a ticket at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or change their minds for whatever reason , they can still cancel without being charged.While the NYC-London deal is good ( thanks to the large amount of daily connections on this route it is possible to find similar deals on regular airlines ) , I think what makes Norwegian really stand out are the fares offered from the West Coast to Europe . $187 incl. taxes from San Francisco ( Oakland ) to Stockholm ? Los Angeles to London for $249 ? Yes , please ! And remember that if you decide to fly to Stockholm or London on this low fare , you can transfer within Europe on the cheap by taking another inexpensive Norwegian flight , say to Rome or Madrid , or like I did to Berlin.During a quick search , I found return flights from L.A. to Copenhagen for $465 which is a steal . If you accept the no-frills policy and the fact that extra fees for meals and baggage are part of the concept of a budget airline and your priority is flying on a low fare , you ca n't go wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and I would n't hesitate to recommend a transatlantic flight with Norwegian Air.By the way:Norwegian also runs long-haul flights between Europe and Bangkok , starting at $204 ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Although I have heard of the low prices , I still was n't sure about what the experience would be like . I 'm 6ft4 so leg room is really important to me . Now seeing you said there was ample room alongside with many fantastic features , I 'll be sure to check it out when I plan my trip to the US next year . = <p> Speaking of ample room I did n't  even mention the overhead storage for the carry-on also designed with plenty of space for the ever growing carry-on pieces = But also , since you have to reserve a seat when you book the flight , that 's actually good for you because that way you know where you 'll sit and you can choose a good one with lots of leg room = <p> We recently saw a flight from Bangkok to Stockholm for under G200 with Norwegian , so we will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cheap , you cant really say no , right ? ! Good to know they have vegan options , even though they might be a bit meagre . <p> I almost booked Stockholm to Bangkok the other day ! It did n't  work out for logistical reasons but that 's such an amazing price ! As for vegan food as long as you stock up on snacks , you 'll be fine = <p> Great review and I have to say thanks for the post because I am looking to fly to the US with them next year but I was worried they would be another version of Ryanair . Now I feel secure making the booking , the price is amazing ! <p> I just came back from a STO-OAK trip and it was great . You meet a lot of budget travelers on that flight too . The connection from Oakland airport to the city or onward can be a bit of a pain when coming back late at night , but the connection to BART is very convenient . I highly recommend getting in on these fares while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to make a write up of this on my blog soon but if you change the currency to NOK , you 'll see a sizeable discount on the fare . You need a tiny bit of FX knowledge to see this right away but for example , I recently booked a trip to Germany and the USD price was around $680 , while the NOK price was 4750 , converted at the rate on the day would have been about 580$ . <p> That 's $100 saved ! A lot of extra bratwursts and beers for me to enjoy ! <p> Johnny , I wish I wouldve known about this before I booked my flight to California with Norwegian a few weeks ago ! ! Will keep it in mind for my next flight = Please feel free to include a link to your article here once its live . Oh and did you see Im giving away a $150 flight voucher for Norwegian this month ? LONG ... <p> Hi Dave , glad that it helped to make up your mind . One thing I love about Norwegian is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can look up the seat plan beforehand and choose a good seat . As long as you 're not stuck in a middle seat for a trans-atlantic flight , you should be fine = <p> Thanks for your review . Last Fall I snatched up tickets for my family of 5 from Oakland , CA to Sweden . ( Leaving in two weeks ! ) I was curious if these flights have wi-fi ; Im worried they are not offered on US flights . I am also curious about the entertainment fees of movies , music and wi-fi ? I am travelling with three young kids and need them to be entertained . I would love to hear of your experience of sleeping on such a long flight ; even if the seats are more spacious , I expect they still wont be very comfortable for sleeping all night . <p> Hillary I cant wait to hear how your flight goes , please feel free to report back = My London New York flight was much shorter than your upcoming flight I 've booked my first Europe West Coast flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , that one will be almost twice as long ( more than 10 hours I think ) , so I am curious to see how comfortable I am on such a long flight . Apparently there was free wi-fi on my flight but to be honest , I did n't  even try to connect , I cherish my offline time on flights because without the internet distraction , I get a lot more done = <p> As for inflight entertainment : that 's all free of charge and there are sooooo many movies , TV shows and music I actually wanted my flight to be longer to take advantage of their huge collection = <p> You 'll never see the worth of a thing unless you try . And in terms to getting cheap flights , to book in advance is the primary tip to catch the best value and meet your budget . Applicable to different airlines though but I cant tell which among the many can keep the best comfortable flight . <p> Great article Dany . We are traveling from LA to Stockholm next week . Was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low fare option . You mentioned you also chose low fare . I 'm curious as to when you got your seat assigned .

Were you able to select seats at the airport ? I 'm flying LA to LGW next month and was also wondering if you were able to do an online check in ( traveling with my girlfriend and we would rather not pay to sit together ) . Thanks ! = ) <p> I 've flown with Norwegian from London to Malaga last year . It was great for a low cost offering online WiFi , no one else does that and service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and onboarding was simpler that others too . This time I 'm considering flying to LA so far its the cheapest being in August since I 've been on a 787 . The only issue is the 7hr wait at the Oslo airport . Would be nice to see some feedback on what to do while I 'm there waiting for the next flight . <p> Brian I actually had a long layover in Oslo last year and luckily there was a Starbucks with wifi and power outlets , so I spent most of my time there working on my laptop ( just do n't  look at the prices .. Norways not cheap = ) <p> Hi Tiffany , I cant seem to find flights from London to Oakland anymore , either ! I knew there was a dispute about the use of the airport , maybe they had to discontinue the route because of that ? I 've flown both economy and premium on Norwegian , and both were great ( 10 hours in Economy and I was NOT uncomfortable ) <p> Well for me it was worth it to book a LowFare+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals and had to check in my luggage . These two add ons wouldve already cost more than the difference between a LowFare and a LowFare+ ticket ( I think it was around $80 more ? ) . I like being able to choose my seat though because I definitely prefer a window seat and sites like Seatguru can tell you exactly which seats to avoid = LONG ... <p> I just booked a flight on Norwegian Air , LAX to London , and I am terrified . I paid only $487 for two tickets , and I read a lot of bad reviews , with technical problems and late departures , and people sleeping in airports . I am tempted to lose the money and fly on a real Airliner , what do you all think ? ? <p> Hi Rose , I flew from Copenhagen to LA with Norwegian in May and my flight experience was excellent ! I had read some negative reviews as well but my flight was on time , the flight attendants were attentive and friendly , no technical problems and I love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review . I 've flown OSL-FLL 5times since Norwegian launched their long haul services . Only once has the plane been delayed at arrival due to closed airport in both MIA and FLL . Every other flight has been within 30min on schedule . Sorry , one landed 1 hour prior to planed = I never order any of the extras as I do n't  worrie about where I sit for a few hours . Only carry-on every time and the food . I share your experience . Room for improvement . <p> Hi Jay , I 've also just booked another trip with Norwegian couldnt resist a transatlantic flight for G213 ( Berlin Bangkok ) ! Also took them from London to Berlin recently and cant say a bad word about them ! = <p> Last year I flew from Tel Aviv to Copenhagen and then on to New York City for less than 300 bucks .. insane right ! My flight to Copenhagen was good , as was my flight to New York , but what scared me just a little was that at the last minute a Norwegian Airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish Airlines Dreamliner . It was OK , but there were times where it felt like the engines were moaning and groaning and having a hard time keeping up . The plane felt a bit dingy and tattered , ( but nothing like the Air Yugoslavia flight I took from Belgrade to New York City back int he 1980s that plane was held together with tooth picks and bubble gum ) , and sometimes it would just vibrate and we would all just look at each other without saying anything . The crew was a mix of LOT and Norwegian . They were very young and amateurish . There did n't  seem to be a purser , and I feel the attendants needed one . I would certainly fly them again , especially given their prices and no crash safety record however LOT Polish dreamliner is nothing compared to Air Canadas dreamliner , which I flew on with Air Canada from Toronto to Tel Aviv . That was amazing , no fear ! The economy airlines always frighten me a bit because I fear low prices may result in potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how my next flight goes . I am planning to fly them to Barcelona later in 2016 . Its either Norwegian or SATA and by the reviews nobody in their right mind flies SATA , so Norwegian it is ! ! ! CIAO . Keep Flying ! ! ! <p> Thanks , Anthony ! Tel Aviv to New York for less than $300 is insane indeed , wow ! I did n't  know that LOTs Dreamliners were scarier or that any Dreamliners could be scary , for that matter ! I thought they were all relatively new ? I love the Dreamliner experience with Norwegian .. almost tempted to book all my transatlantic flights with them just for the awesome planes ( love that they have plugs , and the windows ! ) = But what you say about low prices resulting in cutting maintenance costs I definitely feel that way every time I fly Ryanair = = = <p> Great review , thanks ! Ill be flying to LA in June from Oslo , and , considering I do n't  know how long I 'll stay in California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets for these incredibly low fares 257 euros one way , NON-STOP Oslo-LAX . I 'll write again to tell how it was as an experience ! <p> Hi ! I 'm planning to go from London to New York at the end of july and would like a bit of advice if that 's ok ? : ) I 've never flown by myself before and was a little sceptical about Norweigan Air as I 've never heard of them beforedid you fly general economy ? are the seats spacious enough ? I 'm not exactly the biggest but also not the skinniest galryanair seats were fine for me , but not sure about the 7hr flight ! I 'm glad to see that the entertainment was good , will keep me going for for the 7hrs ! would love for you to give me some advice and to settle my anxieties about Norweigan if that 's ok as I 've read some bad reviews ( as im sure most reviews out there of most airlines are bad let 's be real ! ) , and they 're so much cheaper compared to other airlines ! ! Thank you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I booked the LowFare+ which included meals , baggage and seat selection , so that I was able to choose a window seat . The entertainment system is excellent ( great selection of movies and TV shows ) , the food was good , the seats were comfy bigger than Ryanair for sure ! I am about to book another flight on Norwegian , which will be my third trans-Atlantic flight with them = <p> Hi there , I 've just come across this post as I 've just booked to fly London to LA next spring , the price was too ridiculously good not to do it = So I just had a question as you seem to have flown on the dreamliner with Norwegian a few times nowin terms of seats do you know which are extra leg room and if the exit row seats are comfy ? thanks ! ! = <p> I read a review on seat guru that the attendants kept window shades dark and even if you sat in a window seat you did n't  have control of the window so did n't  make sitting by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beven during daylight hours . Also had trouble choosing a seat as the Norwegian map did n't  match seat guru . Usually prefer window seat but only back left available . Is it noisy ? <p> Hi Monet , I do n't  know how the attendants kept the window shades dark because each window can be controlled via the button below it ? I also loved that the windows on the Dreamliner are bigger than other plane windows ! And our pilot even pointed out the northern lights when we flew over Iceland on my last trans-atlantic flight with Norwegian . As for the seat not sure about how noisy it is because I am using noise-canceling headphones .. The seatguru map should match the Norwegian Dreamliner though ? <p> Hi Monet , I am not sure how the flight attendants kept the window shades dark because there are n't  shades and you have control over how dark/light you want to have your window with a button below it . The windows in the Dreamliner are bigger than in other planes , btw , which I loved ! Our pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iceland on my last trans-atlantic Norwegian flight . As for the noise I use noise-cancelling headphones on flights , so I cant really answer this , but I do n't  think its louder in the back than in other parts of the plane ? <p> I have purchased return ticket to fly from London Gatwick to Los Angeles . I have not booked my seat yet . I was not able to book a seat online as it says that I can only book my seat 24hrs before departure . Please let me know whethe it is Okay to go directly to the check in desk on the day of my departure without pre booking my seat online . Thank you <p> That 's weird , I was always able to select my seat right when I purchased the ticket . If you do n't  book a seat in advance , you 'll probably end up with a crappy middle seat but who knows , maybe you 're lucky and the flight is n't full = <p> I 'm looking into a flight to Stockholm in June and if I go through Norwegian Air its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RT in Euro = $1330.00 USD . Can I book using a US bank and pay the USD = to Euro fee ( $300 saving ) or am I stuck with the higher rate ? <p> Hi Robert , booking in a different currency on the Norwegian website can actually save you some more money- if you feel comfortable using the site in a different language ( Swedish for example ) . I 've tried that and the rate it showed me was cheaper than the US$ price . However , you might also want to check GoogleFlights and might get a cheaper rate the price you mention seems pretty steep to me . <p> I should have mentioned that the fare is for 2 Lowfare+ economy seats from Los Angeles to Stockholm using Google.com/flights . I guess the real question would be , do I need to have the money in that currency ( Euro or SEK ) or will it let me purchase using USD on a site that has the currency set for something other than USD ? Has anyone successfully done this ? 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142818 @2542818/ <h> Niagara Falls Smack Down : The American Falls vs the Canadian Side <p> Now that I have been to both sides of Niagara Falls , I realized just how different the American and the Canadian side are and wanted to share with you the pros and cons of each side , similarities and the main differences , and which side I think you should visit when you plan a trip to Niagara Falls . <p> Unless you 're a total geography buff , you 're probably not familiar with the exact location and division of the Falls between the U.S. and Canada , so let 's start with some background information . <h> Some background info on Niagara Falls <p> Niagara Falls are located 20 minutes ( 17 miles / 27 km ) north of Buffalo , New York on the American side , and about 90 minutes south of Toronto , Ontario ( 75 miles / 121 km ) on the Canadian side . The Falls are located on the Niagara River , a short river that connects Lake Erie with Lake Ontario ( two of the five Great Lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls , and both are appropriately named Niagara Falls . More on both later . <p> Niagara Falls actually consist of three sets of waterfalls : the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side , and the Bridal Veil Falls as well as the American Falls on U.S. soil . <p> Together , they make for the worlds biggest waterfalls by flow rate , with an average of 4 million cubic feet ( 110,000- m3 ) of water falling over the crest line every minute and up to 6 million cubic feet ( 168,000- m3 ) in high flow . <p> In comparison to other famous waterfalls , Niagara Falls are fairly small though : <p> While they are only about a third in width of Iguazu Falls and less than half the height of Victoria Falls , they are still an incredible sight and well worth a visit , and they are still the biggest waterfalls in North America . <p> As I mentioned before , the Falls can be either visited from the American side or from the Canadian side , and I have compiled everything you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's start with what 's similar on both sides . No matter if you 're visiting from the States or from Canada , you can take a 30-minute boat ride close up to the massive Horseshoe Falls ; the Maid Of The Mist leaves every half hour from the U.S. and its Canadian counterpart is the Hornblower Niagara Cruise . Another thing that both sides offer is the possibility to get close up to the Falls with a set of walkways / viewpoints that are right by the Falls . <p> It is possible to visit Niagara Falls entirely for free anything from either country . <p> Getting close to the Falls from Canada and from the U.S. <h> Differences <p> The biggest difference between visiting the Falls from Canada and the U.S. are the views you get . Let 's be honest , Canada just lucked out here and simply has the better vistas : you can get the entire panoramic view of all three waterfalls from the edge of the gorge here , while from the U.S. , you 'll have difficulties seeing the entire horseshoe ' , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be seen if you pay to enter the Cave of the Winds walkways , but then you also only see them from the bottom and not in full panorama . <p> The U.S. side has an advantage though : here , you can get really close to the Falls . While you can get close to the Horseshoe Falls in Canada , you can truly feel the American Falls . <p> Here is some more information on each side : <h> The Canadian Side <p> The Canadian side of Niagara Falls offers you the full panoramic view of all the falls . You can walk along a wide sidewalk along the Niagara Falls Parkway right on the rim of the gorge for about a mile and look down into the Niagara River and see the Falls across from you . <p> The American Falls seen from Canada <p> If you want even broader views of the Falls , you can go up on the Skylon Tower from where you have stunning overhead vistas . The Skylon Tower also has a revolving restaurant , so that you can enjoy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table here includes free access to the observation deck If you book only a ticket , it 's only CAD10.71 if you book it online ! The Brunch Buffet at CAD27.50 is actually pretty good value , considering it includes the observation deck as well . <p> You can get really close to the Horseshoe Falls if you pay for the Journey Behind The Falls experience . You get to take an elevator down 150 feet ( 45 meters ) , walk through a series of caves and finally get to an observation deck right next to the falls . While it is called Behind The Falls , do n't expect to actually get behind them : it 's more like getting a glimpse behind them . You will get drenched though ( rain ponchos are provided ) , and will hear the thundering noise of the rushing water really close up . Admission for the Journey Behind The Falls is CAD15.95 plus tax . <p> The Journey Behind The Falls <p> If you stay overnight , make sure to come back at night to see the Niagara Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in changing colors " it is a neat sight . During the summer months , there are also fireworks on Fridays and Sundays and on public holidays . <p> If you have difficulties walking , there is a hop-on hop-off bus service that connects the main attractions in town and several lookouts along the Falls ; a day ticket is $7 per person . You can find the schedule and route map here . <p> The Falls lit up <h> The American Side <p> The American side might not have the panoramic views that Canada has , but it let 's you get super close to the water . There is one big observation deck which you can enter for free and where you get the best vistas of a big part of the falls . <p> You can also take the 30-minute boat ride into the rushing Horseshoe Falls and get soaked that way , or you walk along the wooden walkways of the Cave Of The Winds experience . The cave that it is named after is long gone ( it collapsed in 1954 ) , but the walkways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep into the Niagara Gorge , get you so close to the waterfalls that you basically get a free ( and strong ! ) shower , especially on the appropriately named Hurricane Deck at the bottom of the American Falls . On this deck , you are only 20 feet ( 6 meters ) from the Bridal Veil Falls ! Admission for the Cave of the Winds experience is USD12 per person , the Maid Of The Mist is USD17 . <p> Getting soaked on the Hurricane Deck <p> In addition to these paid-for experiences , there is are several viewing points at the rim , one right in between the two American Falls ( on Goat Island , a little Island that separates the American Falls from the Horseshoe Falls ) . <p> There is a hop-on hop-off trolley service in the Niagara State Park for only $2 per person if you have difficulties walking . <p> Winner : Canada , these views are just unbeatable ! <p> The Horseshoe Falls seen from Canada <h> The cities <p> Niagara Falls Canada <p> Its no secret that Jess and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canadian side in 2011 . The city felt tacky , everything was set up to get every tourist dollar possible : haunted houses ( seriously , who needs four haunted houses ? Especially in a city that small. ) , wax museums , Ripleys Believe It Or Not , Hersheys Chocolate World and many fast food chains . <p> If you cant entertain your kids with an awe-inspiring natural wonder , you 'll get the chance to do that here ( and spend lots of cash ) . Ironically , most of the chains who set up shop here are American , it seems like even they knew the Canadian side is the one that 's bringing in the big bucks . For the grown-ups in need of additional entertainment , there are not one but TWO casinos to carry your money to . <p> Niagara Falls USA <p> The American side feels more tranquil , less crowded and less tacky other than a Wax Museum of History , a haunted house and an aquarium , and the giant casino that 's towering over all the other buildings , there is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide some entertainment that you do n't  have to pay for and that 's more family-friendly , like free board games , outdoor movie nights in the summer , concerts and even fitness events . You can find the entire program here . <p> I thought that there was much greener here , and it is known that you can go on better hikes along the Niagara River from here . This side is definitely right for you if you 're planning a couple of hikes in addition to visiting the Falls . You can find some more details on the hiking options here . <p> Winner : Niagara Falls USA <h> Which side should you visit ? <p> Absolutely no question : Visit both sides ! I 'd recommend planning in enough time to visit both Canada 's and the American side to get the full Niagara experience . I thought it was very similar to my experience at Iguazu Falls " while I got to get a real close-up encounter with the Falls on the Argentinian side , the breathtaking vistas are what you only get from Brazil . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , but the better close-up experience from the U.S. <p> Getting close to the Falls on the American side <h> How to cross the border at Niagara Falls <p> Thanks to the Rainbow Bridge , which connects Canada and the U.S. right by the Falls , you can easily cross from one country into the other " as long as you pack your passport ! Make also sure to check visa regulations for your country of origin . The toll to cross the bridge is 0.50 Cent if you cross on foot , but higher for cars , RVs and trucks . You can find the current prices here . If you visit the Falls with your car , there 's no need for you to take it to the other side you can just walk over the bridge and explore the Falls on foot , unless you are n't  in good health . <p> The panoramic views from the Canadian side <h> Where To Stay In Niagara Falls <p> Niagara Falls is one of the most popular tourist attractions in North America , so naturally there are plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a bunch of cheapie motels that are very basic and some are downright filthy . They are cheap , but not enjoyable , trust me . Before you book a hotel or motel , make sure to check the latest reviews before going for what may seem like a bargain deal , and the review score . Ive put together a few options on both the Canadian and the U.S. side for you , for all budgets . <p> Note:The Canadian side has considerably more options , including some hotels with direct views of the falls from your hotel window . Its definitely worth to splurge on a room with a view of the falls ! <h> On the Canadian Side <p> Budget:There are a couple of gorgeous B&amp;Bs which offer accommodation for under $100 , including breakfast . <p> Mid-range : The mid-range hotels are pretty much all major hotel chains . The Sheraton and even the Radisson are much better than the overpriced Hilton , both have rooms for around $160 , compared to a starting price of $300 for the Hilton . And both have spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truly luxurious hotels , but the Marriott Fallsview Hotel &amp; Spa is your best option . Note that Marriott has two other properties here , the Marriott Courtyard and the Marriott on the Falls ( in case you want to use your Marriott points ) . <h> Stay at an Airbnb and cook for yourself ! <p> Having a kitchen and being able to cook for myself is always the biggest draw for me to stay at an Airbnb , and after two visits to Niagara Falls with a number of disappointing restaurant visits there ( read : overpriced and forgettable meals ) , I 'd stay at an Airbnb on my next visit . There are a number of rooms and entire apartments listed on the website on both the Canadian and the U.S. site , starting at $30 . <p> Have you been to Niagara Falls ?

I wonder if that 's even possible ( with harnesses and stuff ) or if there 's not enough space . Anyways , must be cool to be able to hear the power and force that the water generates ! <p> They make it sound like you can go behind the falls but that 's kinda cheeky I also saw a lot of people complaining about that on Tripadvisor . They were under the impression theyd get to go behind the falls , when in fact , they were only able to look behind them ( sort of ! ) I did get to go behind a waterfall in Mexico once though and loved it ! It was much smaller than Niagara though , I do n't  think itd be safe to do that there = <p> Hi , I 'm trying to figure out if its reasonable to not only walk from one from one side to the other over the bridge , but then walk to one of the gorge trails and then enjoy that . Or should I just plan a gorge trail on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think its an over-rated attraction ( especially if you live in Toronto ) , the Falls is still VERY impressive ! And I totally agree with you that the Canadian side is tacky , to say the least . But , we do have a saving grace , in the form of Niagara-on-the-Lake , though , so I think we redeemed ourselves that way = Glad you enjoyed the natural wonder ! I 'm looking forward to reading your posts and recommendations on Buffalo , as its a city I ALWAYS pass by , but never thought of visiting/stopping by . <p> I have only been to the Canadian side and I definitely agree that the views are pretty spectacular . I also did n't  like the town of Niagara Falls so we stayed at Niagara on the Lake instead a gorgeous Victorian town surrounded by wineries . I would say it is a definite must visit if you are in the area <p> I only visited the Canadian side , but would love to go back and experience the American side . It was an amazing trip and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the overly touristic entertainment . My friend and I were almost shocked why such a commercial , neon lights filled , money wasting place was so close to such a beautiful natural wonder . It kinda ruined the feeling . Too bad , so we just decided to no longer look at it and focus on the falls = <p> We were certainly shocked when we visited for the first time , from the Canadian side . And I was surprised that Canada was worse than the US in that respect you 'd think it would be the other way around . Canada is usually so good with keeping its natural beauty protected and undisturbed . <p> The downtown area of Niagara Falls in Canada is definitely tacky but there is a spectacular parkway trail that runs along the river from Niagara Falls to Niagara on the Lake . It can be hiked , biked or driven . If you have n't seen this , then youve only experienced less than half of what the Canadian side has to offer in terms of the natural beauty of the Niagara area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far better. ! When anyone mentions Niagara they think of Canada . Yes , the town is a bit tacky but that is its charm . Every time we go there we have so much fun . It is a very old town and it has n't  changed much . Also the film Niagara is centered on the Canadian side . Let 's face it . Niagara Falls is the Horseshoe Falls , end of . <p> Hi ! I am planning a 2 day trip in early January and I 'm so glad I found your site ! Never been before so I was researching how to cross Rainbow Bridge on foot sounds awesome and exactly what I was looking to find out . So we do n't  need a car and we can all just walk perfect ! Ca n't wait to go.been on my list for many years ! thank you . <p> Helen , thanks so much for taking the time and commenting = Make sure to bring your passport so that you 'll be able to walk from Canada to the US or vice versa . I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're frozen at that time of year ) . Enjoy Niagara ! <p> I hope you can help me ! Our family ( 2 adults , 6 children ages 2-15 ) is planning a trip to Niagra Falls this summer . If we park on the US side , is it reasonable to think we can hike to the Canadian side ( with passports &amp; birth certificates in hand , of course ! ) and take in the views you mention then walk back in one day ? Do you think the bridge you mention is stroller friendly ? THANK YOU for any help ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142819 @2542819/ <h> Why I think everyone who loves travel should get started with housesitting <p> Housesitting is one of the main travel tools that has allowed me to travel non-stop since 2010 . <p> Its saved me more ( probably a lot more , but let 's be conservative ) over $20,000 in accommodation costs alone . <p> Yet when I- talk to people , many of them have never even heard of housesitting ! <p> It might still be off most peoples radars , but if you 're here , then you probably love travel . And if you love traveling , we want you to seriously consider housesitting . <p> Put simply housesitting allows you to : <p> Travel the world <p> Live like a local <p> Feel right at home <p> Plus , you stay for free in a house or condo that is likely bigger and better than any hotel suite ( except for Necker Island . Richard Branson still probably has you beat ) . <p> Staying in hotels and hostels can quickly eat through your budget . Vacation apartment rentals can cut costs if you 're staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inflated monthly rent to live somewhere with only the bare minimum in terms of comfort and supplies . <p> When you housesit , you live in someones house , with access to all its facilities , in exchange for keeping the house and usually their pets safe and happy while living like a local in a new neighborhood in a different city/country/continent ! <p> Enjoying the pool during a housesit in Arizona <p> Even though this is still an underground idea , there are thousands of people out there housesitting already .

@@107142825 @2542825/ <h> The grand finale of my Philippines trip : El Nido ( Part I ) <p> El Nido was one of the two places I was looking forward to the most on my Philippines trip ( the other one was Boracay ) , as everyone who had been there was raving about the unspoiled beauty of the deserted islands off the coast of Palawan , the island El Nido is located on.As I was holding on for my dear life in the van that took me up to El Nido from Puerto Princesa , Palawans main airport , I was praying that it would live up to my high expectations , but since Palawan had recently been declared the most beautiful island in the world , I was pretty confident that it would n't disappoint.When I booked my flight to Puerto Princesa , I was n't aware that it would take another 5-6 hours to get to El Nido from the airport , which would make this a 16-hour travel day starting in Dumaguete 6am in the morning and reaching El Nido 9pm at night . The hours in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far , even beating the van driver from Laos to Chiang Mai who fell asleep halfway through , forcing one of us passengers to take over the wheel.This driver surely saw the narrow winding mountain roads of Palawan as his own personal race track , and several times when he accelerated before a sharp turn I was convinced we 'd shoot over the guardrail into the woods.Against all odds we made it to el Nido alive , and I realized mistake #2 : not booking a hostel in advance . My driver took me to a number of places , all of which were full , and just when I was about to give up hope and thought I would have to spend the night on the beach , I lucked out and got the last single room in a hostel.When I went to explore the town the next morning , I was n't all too impressed , to be honest . The beach seemed dirty , and while others might find the ramshackle buildings charming , I just found them .. ugly.But nobody comes to El Nido for the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archipelago is made of 45 islets , most of them nothing more than limestone karst cliff outcrops surrounded by crystal clear water , some of them boasting secret beaches or hidden lagoons . What all of them have in common is that they offer some of the best snorkeling in the country.The best way to see as many of them as possible ? Go on an island hopping tour . There are four different tours which can be booked just about anywhere in town , creatively titled Tour A , B , C and D. The tours are all pretty similar : the boats leave El Nido around 9am and get back around 5pm , include a lunch and 4 to 5 snorkeling stops.When I researched the various tours to decide which ones to go on , I had found that most people were recommending A and C , so those were the ones I went on ( I would have loved to hop on all four tours , but El Nido is not the cheapest place to hang around in , and its probably good that there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run out of money ) . I decided to start with tour A and on a rather cloudy morning I hopped on a little Filipino fishing boat to cruise around the islands.Our first stop was the 7 Commandment beach , a small sandy beach , fringed by palm trees . The snorkeling area was small and I almost did n't  go in the water because it was still overcast and I thought I might even be cold . But I am so glad I eventually did go in ! There were already more fish in this little spot than I had seen in all four of my snorkeling stops in Apo Island . It was like a beautiful underwater plant garden , and I would have been satisfied staying here all day , laying out on the gorgeous beach and going for an occasional snorkeling dip , but this was only stop 1 of 5 . The second stop was already our lunch stop , and we spent well over an hour on a tiny strip of sand beach , and the crew was preparing lunch ( lots of fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snorkeling . The snorkeling area was much bigger than on the first beach , and I loved the marine life here . You could snorkel all the way out to a massive limestone rock that stuck out of the ocean if you were a good swimmer and see plenty of fish everywhere around you.After lunch ( very filling if you 're not a vegetarian ; leaving you starving if you 're a vegetarian ) , we moved on to our third stop , a hidden lagoon that we had to swim into , entering via a small hole in the rock . Getting there was a bit difficult because it was extremely rocky we were all wearing our flip flops or water shoes and were still struggling . Here I could see why Alex Garlands The Beach was apparently inspired by his time in the Philippines ( even though the book is set in Thailand ) . He was probably trying to keep the real beach a secret , but in this case , when five boats get there at the same time and fifty people try to make their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only at the end , when everybody else had left and the lagoon was almost empty , I came to appreciate the stunning beauty of it with the towering limestone rocks towering high above me.Next was an absolutely stunning stop : First we cruised in a big circle through the Big Lagoon , only open to the ocean on one side , and surrounded by massive limestone rocks on all sides . After that , we stopped outside the lagoon to snorkel in what is best described as a real-life aquarium . The coral , the plants , the fish so so many fish it truly felt as if someone had dropped me into an aquarium . I couldve stayed there forever.This was only my first island hopping trip in El Nido , and it did n't disappoint . I was already looking forward to my next one ! 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 25 Comments <p> The Bacuit Archipelago is so amazing but I was disappointed with the town of El Nido too . I made the same mistake of not booking a place in advance . Everything was either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the main beach in El Nido is murky and not really suitable for swimming . Did you make it to Las Cabanas Beach while you were there ? I really enjoyed it .

I think most of the sewage goes in the water right there . I did make it to Cabanas Beach and LOVED it ! What a gorgeous beach = <p> During high season , its indeed very important to book your hotel or hostel in advance ! There 's basically more demand than offer and its not rare to see tourists wandering around desperately trying to find an hotel room . What did you eventually ( expensive place , or sleeping on the beach = ) ? <p> Thanks for this honest write up ! I am going to El Nido in December and am looking into doing tours A and C as well . Any recommendations on which part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dirty , I would rather not stay there . Also , how many days did you stay in El Nido and did you think it was enough ? Thanks again ! <p> I have all practical information coming up in part II of this post , which will go live tomorrow , Tausha = I stayed five nights relaxed on my first day since I got in too late to book a tour for the next day , otherwise I wouldve hopped on a tour right the next day . Then I took a tour , the day after that I explored the area around El Nido and went to Las Cabanas beach ( well worth it ) and Sunset Beach ( also very pretty ) , on the third day I took another tour , the next day I left . So I had four full days there . I couldve spent another day or two to take the other two tours , and other people were renting motorbikes to explore waterfalls and other beaches that were further away . Five nights were just right for me though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Nido = <p> It looks like a paradise the white sand , fishermen boats , lagoons ! My first thought was that it looked like from The Beach movie and then I read your note that it was an inspiration for the movie = <p> Yes , it made me want to join the Tao Expedition , a 4 or 5 day boat ride from Coron to El Nido ( or the other way around ) , where you get to see even more deserted islands , secluded beaches and dreamy lagoons . I hope I 'll get to do it one day ! <p> You 'll love it , Katie ! ! Tour B and D looked interesting but one focused on beaches and the other one on caves I wanted to island hop = I wouldve loved to do all four ! I hope I 'll make it back there one day but then I 'd join a Tao Expedition ! <p> Hi Mike , if money does n't  play a role , you can fly straight into El Nido . There 's a small airport there that has 3 daily flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny and luggage is limited to 10kg this includes carry-on ! One way is PHP6,750 ( US$151 ) . You can book tickets by emailing email protected . When flying into Puerto Princesa , there 's no faster way than these vans ( even a car service couldnt be faster than the driver I had ) the buses take even longer ( 7 8 hours ) . <p> I am glad I 'm not the only one who felt about that ride the way I did ! I 'd love to return but just the thought of the ride .. I guess I 'll need to let some more time pass before I think about going back = <p> HI . Its been great reading the notes on this part of the world . Thank you ! We are doing the TAO EXPERIENCE .

Can you suggest a nice hotel that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TAO experience ! I would spend max 2 nights in El Nido at the end of the trip . Yes , there are a couple of nice bars and restaurants , but especially after the TAO I think you 'll find the beach there disappointing . You could take a trip to another , nicer beach the next day ( I believe it was called Sunset Beach ? ) but other than that , do n't  bother with El Nido . And like I said in my post I had the hardest time finding a nice place to stay at a reasonable price . I usually check Booking.com and only go for places with a rating higher than 8 and good reviews .

@@107142826 @2542826/ <h> Walking through Italy : Highlights from the Via Amerina , Part II <p> After the first big leg of the hike along the Via Amerina , from Castel dellAquila to Amelia , and a good nights sleep ( we were all so tired that we fell asleep as soon as our heads hit the pillow ) , and a typical Italian breakfast ( a cappuccino and a sweet pastry ) , we started the walk to our next destination : Orte , around 10 miles ( 17 kilometers ) south of Amelia.Like the day before , we traversed vineyards and fields , huffing and puffing as we climbed the hills . On this part of the Via , we also passed an open-air chapel , a reminder that we were n't just on a random hike through the countryside , but on a pilgrimage . <p> Orte : Another Enchanting Medieval Hilltop Town <p> The last part of the hike was the most challenging : We could see Orte majestically crowning the top of a tuff cliff front of us , and with a lot of moaning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our first stop in the Latium region.We entered another stunning medieval town through one of several massive stone gates , hundreds of years old , and rested at the town square for a while , watching another flag-twirling performance , before we explored Orte 's well-preserved underground ' . Because the town sits on top of a cliff , the Romans built many tunnels , caverns and cisterns underneath the city , some of which can be visited with a tour guide.Orte is not just worth a visit for its underground relics though " the town itself is stunning . Just like with medieval churches , I do n't think I 'll ever tire of wandering through medieval towns , marvel at the imposing stone buildings , follow the narrow lanes to see where they lead me , and imagining what life must have been like here in medieval times . It seems like not much has changed since then , at least on the outside.Only five miles south of Orte , we passed through Vasanello , another quaint medieval town with a small castle and a beautiful 13th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taken from the Via Amerina.Another highlight of the Via was the leg between Morticelli , where we passed a small necropolis , the Necropoli di Morticelli , where tombs have been carved into the tuff , and Corchiano , where we traversed the Forre di Corchiano , a narrow gorge that follows the Rio Fratta.On that stretch of the path , we passed a beautiful arched Roman Bridge which was still intact , and several caves with Byzantine graves and tombs . The scenery here is completely different from what we 'd seen in Umbria . <p> The Natural Monuments Of Latium <p> Instead of rolling hills , we were walking through thick forest , and we learned that the Forre Di Corchiano is part of the WWF LOasi di Pian SantAngelo , a 254-hectare large natural monument , rewarded this title thanks to its outstanding natural beauty and unique archeological finds.We left the Via for a quick visit to Civita Castellana , about 4 miles ( 6 kilometers ) east of Falerii Novi , a town also founded by the Falisci , who called it Falerii . Civita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town center , but for its attractive Cathedral , also known as Il Duomo , which has some remarkable geometrical floor mosaics and which has a unique Cosmatesque fa+ade ( signed and dated in gold mosaic tiles , dating back to 1210 ) , and Forte Sangallo , the fortress , which was built by Pope Alexander VI . The fortress houses an Etruscan Museum with a considerable collection.After spending the night in Civita Castellana , we continued our walk southwards the next morning " 7.5 miles ( 12 kilometers ) to the town of Nepi.We started the day on a particularly lovely section of the route , which led us through hazelnut orchards , the ground filled with hazelnuts that were going to be used for one of Ferrero 's irresistible hazelnut chocolate creations , until we reached the ruins of the walled settlement of Falerii Novi.Created by the Romans , the stone entrance gate of Falerii Novi is still intact , and the striking church of- Santa Maria of Falerii- is still in great condition next to the ruins of Falerii Novi . <p> The Original Via Amerina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we continued our hike on one of the best known parts of the Via Amerina : Cavo degli Zucchi , a stretch of the road that is flanked by a series of tombs which are carved directly out of the tall tuff cliff.This part of the road has been excavated over the past 30+ years , uncovering the original basalt rocks that were put down by the Romans to pave the road . The exposed road is so well preserved that you can even see imprints from the wagons that were rolling down the Via Amerina hundreds of years ago.The cliffs that line the road for about 1.3 miles ( 2 kilometers ) house 196 graves between Cavo degli Zucchi and Cava Foce Tre Ponti ( also known as Necropoli dei Tre Ponti ) . This area is known to be inhabited by the Falisci , an ethnic group said to have been of Greek origin , who also inhabited Falerii and Falerii Novi.Before reaching Nepi , we stopped at Castel Sant'Elia , a small town that sits on the ridge of the Suppetonia Valley , a gorge that winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 200 meters ) deep and 2,300 feet ( 700 meters ) wide . The Basilica , a medieval church built into the cliff over an ancient temple of- Diana , features several mosaics and frescoes that are worth peeking inside for.We made our way up the mountain to the top of the cliff , where we found an old monastery , the Sanctuary of Santa Maria ad Rupes , which houses the Shrine of St Maria ad Rupes ' . The shrine is connected to the surface by a tunnel by 144 steps carved by hand by a local hermit , an endeavor that took him 14 years to finish . <p> Catacombs and a Fortress in Nepi <p> And then we arrived in Nepi , another small medieval town with cobblestone streets and a 12th century cathedral , where there were two other sights worth stopping for , the first being Castello Borgia . We were able to climb to the top of one of the circular towers of this 16th century fortress , an effort that was rewarded with breathtaking views over the city and the surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight in Nepi is the Santa Savinilla Catacombs , an underground cemetery that dates back to the 5th century . The excavated graves are exceptionally well preserved , some of them still housing the bones and skulls of the deceased.I 've seen a number of catacombs throughout Europe , but Santa Savinilla , albeit small , was among the most impressive underground graveyards I have been to . <p> Calcata : Italy 's Most Artsy Village <p> After our afternoon in Nepi , we ventured off the path , away from the Via , and made a little detour to Calcata , another small hilltop village that is close enough to Rome to visit on a day trip , reminding us that we were not far from our final destination now.I fell in love with the village the minute it came into sight : a tiny fortified settlement perched atop a stump of volcanic rock , a small castle jutting out of the stone roofs of the medieval houses , surrounded by lush green forest on all sides.Calcata almost ended up as a ghost town when the Italian government declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliffs it was sitting on were crumbling . The majority of the people who lived in Calcata moved half a mile up the road , where they built a new town , Calcata Nuova , which left the village nearly deserted.In the 60s and 70s artists and hippies discovered the little village , drawn by the mythical energy that supposedly emanates from the volcanic stump it sits on , but also by the fairy-tale like feel and the enchanting atmosphere in the village with its crooked streets and maze of cobblestone alleyways.Today , the village is home to over 100 artists , New Age types who are selling jewelry , display their paintings and sculptures in little galleries , and run charming little tea and coffee shops . Calcata gets overrun by day trippers from Rome and other nearby towns , especially on weekends , and it is easy to see why " I could 've wandered the little streets for hours , visiting all the tiny galleries , gorging on homemade cakes while enjoying the views over the surrounding countryside . If I were to go back to Calcata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in town for a couple of nights , or even take up a month-long artists ' residency.This detour left me feel invigorated , feeding me enough energy for the last part of the trek . Sadly , due to time constraints , I did n't get to walk the entire last part from Nepi to Rome via Campagno di Roma ( 17km ) and La Storta ( 20km from Campagno di Roma ) , with a final 12.5 mile ( 20 kilometers ) day that eventually brings you to Rome and Piazza St Pietro ( St Peter 's Square ) . <p> The Final Stretch to Rome <p> Instead , we started at the trail head for the alternative route which leads through the Insugherata Nature Park . Walking this way means you are not following the traffic-heavy Via Cassia , which meets the Via Amerina on its final stretch to Rome , alternatively walking through beautiful nature for 4 miles ( 6 kilometers ) right into Rome , where the path rejoins the original route near Piazza Igea.The entire walk is 8.7 miles ( 14 kilometers ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than following the road , especially because I knew we would be walking through the busy streets of Rome later on . <p> The Papal Audience in St Peter 's Square <p> Getting a first glimpse of St Peter 's Cathedral from Monte Mario was spectacular " at last seeing that the end was near , and that we had nearly reached our final destination.Most pilgrims plan their arrival in Rome for a Tuesday so that they can attend the papal audience that is held in St Peter 's Square every Wednesday . Even as a non-religious person , I could n't deny the special aura in the square , filled with thousands of pilgrims from all over the world who were listening to the Pope 's speech and receiving his apostolic blessing.No matter if you are Catholic or not , ending a walk through Italy at the papal audience makes it feel even more extraordinary : you have done something that only very few people do . Going to Rome ? Easy . But walking to Rome ? An exceptional achievement . <p> The Walk Continues : Wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tired from the long days of walking and skipped sightseeing in Rome , but I love this city so much , I could n't leave without spending at least one day in the city.I wandered the streets of Trastevere , my favorite neighborhood , and revisited the majestic landmarks of the city that made such an impression on me when I came to Rome for the first time , back when I was a teenager the Collosseum , the Pantheon , the Roman Forum and the Fontana di Trevi.If you walk the Via Amerina or another pilgrims ' route and this is your first time in Rome , I recommend taking a rest day and then spending a few days exploring the city . Even though the walk is a journey in itself , your final destination is too sensational to be left out.I could have spent another week in Rome , but sadly I was pressed for time .

@@107142827 @2542827/ <h> Caribbean Vibes and a Giant Scare in Palomino , Colombia <p> I admit that until the very minute we hopped on the bus to Palomino , we werent sure if we had made the right decision to go there , and if we would actually enjoy the small beach town . We had read in travel guides and blogs that the current was too strong to allow for swimming in the ocean , and our hostel of choice , the Dreamer Hostel , was fully booked because we had waited too long to make a reservation.However , when I saw photos of snow-capped mountains just behind a palm-fringed , white-sand beach , it looked too magical to skip.So we ended up booking a bungalow right by the beach pricey , compared to the Dreamer , but we came here for the beach after all , so we wanted to be as close to the beach as possible . And that was the only good thing about the place : that it was a beachfront property.I eagerly tried to see the snow-capped peak I had seen in pictures as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the mountains of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , the world 's highest coastal mountain range , never showed.The true showstopper in Palomino is n't the mountains anyway , but the tropical beach , which was postcard-perfect , begging to be put on the cover of a glossy travel magazine . And the best part ? We felt as if we were the only people around " what a difference to Tayrona or Bahia Concha which both had been crowded.When we went for a long stroll along the beach we passed a handful of restaurants , a volleyball net , and a few hotels " that 's all there was ! And those hotels ? They were hidden so well behind the palm trees that they were barely visible . Had there not been the occasional beach loungers , it would have felt as if there were no buildings at all , only the deserted white sand beach , which went on for as far as the eye could see.It was as if we had stumbled upon a secluded Caribbean paradise , and it reminded me of Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be discovered , even though it had everything it takes to be a popular vacation spot ( plus : with the current exchange rate between US Dollar and Colombian Pesos , it is super cheap ! ) . The guidebooks had n't  lied though : the water was rough , and the waves scarily high . Almost no one was in the water , and I only took a few dips in the ocean to cool off . Palomino might not be great for swimming , but it is a perfect place to get away from it all and to enjoy solitude and tranquility in a paradise-like setting.As we walked back towards the village , I was surprised to see several signs for yoga and even a vegetarian restaurant , La Sirena , where we had lunch later on . Even in this tiny beach town far off the tourist path you could pursue a holistic lifestyle . I guess that also means that the secret is out and Palomino is expecting to see an increase in tourists.A few years ago , I learned , there were only a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hammock on the beach , now there were several eco-lodges and fancier hotels , but still only about two dozen , most of them further away from the core of the village.Upon returning to our caba+a , we had a surprise waiting for us : all of our belongings were strewn across the floor , everything had been pulled out of pockets , little bags , compartments of our backpacks and small daypacks . Somebody had broken into our bungalow . My heart dropped when I saw the mess : all of our valuables credit cards , laptops , passports , camera gear and our Kindles were in my backpack . I saw the contents of the bottom compartment of my backpack all over the tiled floor , but then I saw that the main compartment was still locked . <p> I had no idea somebody was trying to steal all my stuff while I was blissfully reading on the beach <p> I could n't believe how lucky we were . Thank God I was carrying a small padlock with me to lock up my backpack and that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their way into the bungalow , because it seemed like theyd left in a hurry . Our electronic chargers had been compiled on the bed but werent taken . All that was missing was an emergency $20 hidden in a small cosmetics bag . But another $80 in cash , also hidden in a small bag , was n't found , even though the thief had searched that bag.Despite the fact that our losses were minimal , I was shaken up . Just thinking about how differently this couldve ended ( and ended our trip ! ) made me feel sick to my stomach . I needed a drink . <p> Instead of a drink , we opted for a late afternoon river tubing session . Because the current is so strong in Palomino , the popular alternative to swimming in the ocean is slowly floating down the river that eventually flows into the ocean.Armed with two giant tires , we hopped on the back of two moto taxis ( the only way to get around Palomino ) and were dropped off at a dirt path in the forest shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb a mountain first it was a 25-minute walk to the river , up a steep and slippery dirt path , and then back down the hill on the other side .

We could n't help but relax while we were slowly moving down the river , marveling at the jungle forests around us and listening to the sounds of the jungle.Unfortunately we miscalculated how long it would take us to get down to the ocean , or even to the bridge we were told to get off at should it get too dark . Suddenly , we were floating down the river in complete darkness , and the only light we had was the moon shining bright in the sky . A little hysteria panic ensued when we had to walk through the river in the pitch black darkness ( river monsters are a real thing , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the main road . The nerve-wrecking ending of our tubing adventure was something we could have done without on this already tumultuous day , but it did n't  take away from the amazing experience of our afternoon on the river . <p> I highly recommend tubing when you go to Palomino " that alone made the trip there worth it for us . A friend of mine who had been to Palomino a few months prior had told me she loved it so much that she ended up spending a whole week there , and while that would 've probably been too long for me , I could see how she got sucked into the relaxed lifestyle of morning yoga , a reading session in a hammock , fresh fruit juices for lunch ( they serve them in one liter buckets at the Dreamer Hostel ! ) , and lazy afternoons by the pool before the obligatory sunset beers on the beach . 129333 @qwx989333 <p> How to get to Palomino <p> Marsol offers a direct shuttle service from Cartagena ( COP75,000 /US$26 ) .

You might find cheaper tire rentals on the main road of Palomino , away from the beach . It takes about 1.5 hours from the starting point in the jungle down to the ocean . <p> Eating Out - <p> Most restaurants are located on the main road , and not on the beach , and I found every meal I had in one of the beach restaurants mediocre except for my meal at the La Sirena- vegetarian restaurant . <p> Safety <p> Despite having my bungalow broken into , I would n't say Palomino is more unsafe than other places in Colombia . It seemed more like somebody had seized an opportunity , this was n't an organized crime or even an experienced thief . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142828 @2542828/ <h> 35 Places I Love In Seattle <p> I 've decided to change things up a little bit with my Things I Love About series . Instead of telling you all the things I love about Seattle , I 'll share 35 places I loved with you ( It was supposed to be 33 places , but somehow I ended up with 35 ! ) <p> These are my personal favorites from a month in Seattle , so this list is pretty biased and focuses on the things that I love : craft beer , parks , speakeasy bars , great views , cool neighborhoods , food , and of course COFFEE . <p> I feel like I only got a taste of Seattle during my four weeks there , and with so many rained-out days , I also did n't get around to visiting all the places I had on my to-do-list , so please consider this list by no means- complete . These are some of the places I loved , so feel free to use this post for some inspiration for things to check out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the end . <p> 1 Golden Gardens <p> This gorgeous beach in the north of Seattle made me wish I was visiting during the summer months , but even on the chilly October day I visited it made for a nice autumn walk along the beach . There are several hiking trails and two wetlands in the park . I think this is also an amazing spot to watch the sunset . <p> 2 Top Pots Doughnuts <p> I 've done thorough research on the topic of doughnuts during my time in Seattle , and can attest that Top Pots have the best doughnuts in town ( their Apple Fritter is to die for ) . If you 're a doughnut lover , I 'd recommend skipping the highly praised General Porpoise and heading straight to one of the Top Pots branches instead . <p> 3- Joe Block Park <p> This little gem of a park is a place I would 've never found , had a friendly local not pointed me towards it . A little-known park ( even for Seattlites ! ) it is a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is located in West Seattle , close to the port , and basically on the way to Alki Beach . But since it is closer to Downtown Seattle than Alki , the views here are actually better ( Alki is also known for fantastic views over Seattle ) . There is a walking pier that has an observation deck with benches at the end , offering sweeping views over Downtown Seattle and Puget Sound . I loved this place and would go back for a sunset picnic next time . <p> I loved this little park which occupies the Bailey Peninsula in Lake Washington so much that I dedicated an entire Polaroid Of The Week to it " I loved the paved trail that goes around the entire peninsula along the water , and the dirt trails that lead up the hill through the forest . If you make it here , I recommend combining it with a meal in the cool Raconteur restaurant ( inside a bookstore , always worth going in , if you love books as much as I do ) or a coffee at Caffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood . <p> This neighborhood in the north of Seattle describes itself as the Center Of The Universe ' . While I am not sure how much I agree with that , I loved the artsy vibe in this neighborhood : there are plenty of sculptures , some street art and even a troll who lives under the Aurora Bridge and is cherished by the locals . So yes , Fremont is one of Seattle 's quirkier neighborhoods . If you go , do n't miss the Theo Chocolate Factory Tour " it 's only $10 and includes a chocolate sampling . There 's also a factory shop worth visiting should you not make it on a tour . <p> 8 Olympic Sculpture Park <p> The Olympic Sculpture Park sits right on the shores of Puget Sound and belongs to the Seattle Art Museum . If you 're into art , both are worth a visit . The Art Museum is free on the first Thursday of every month . <p> 9 Gas Works Park <p> I loved this park for its stunning views over Lake Union and since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light Company , a gasification plant , the rusty remnants of the plants make for awesome photo ops . Every time I went there on a sunny day , the meadows were filled with sun worshippers . Just like Freeway Park , this is a park that 's unlike any other park I 've been to . <p> 10 JhanJay <p> Even if you 're not a vegetarian , I highly recommend stopping by JhanJay 's , where I had the best vegetarian Thai food outside of Thailand . There are two branches " one in Ballard and one in Wallingford . You 'll thank me later . <p> 11 Frye Art Museum <p> Another great art museum " and this one is FREE all the time ! Located in the First Hill neighborhood , you can walk to the Frye Museum from downtown . <p> 12 Alki Beach <p> This might be my favorite beach in Seattle " and a great place to run or walk . Alki Beach is 3.1 miles ( 5k ) long and offers sweeping vistas of Downtown Seattle . It 's a little out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a car , it 's worth going there and you could combine it with Mexican food &amp; drink happy hour at Cactus , or a doughnut breakfast at Top Pots , artisan pizza at Phoenicia or more scrumptious burritos at El Chupacabra ( scroll down to #26 for more details ) . <p> Seattle 's oldest neighborhood is industrial and still feels a little gritty , but it is quickly becoming super hip and makes for a fun afternoon : there are a couple of cool coffee shops ( The Conservatory and All City ) , a superb Mexican restaurant ( Fonda La Catrina ) , Georgetown Liquor Company and a couple of small breweries ( Georgetown Brewing Co and Machine House Brewery ) , all a short walk from one another , and there is also some cool street art to admire . <p> 15 Ballard Locks <p> The Ballard Locks are a complex of locks in the Lake Washington Ship Canal at the west end of Salmon Bay . Apparently they carry more boat traffic than any other locks in the U.S. which makes it fun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drained or elevated in order to let ships pass through . Do n't miss the salmon viewing station on the south side of the locks " here , you can watch salmon migrate up the fish ladder between June and October . <p> 16 Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizza <p> I am a huge pizza snob , especially after spending so much time in New York City . Domino 's or Papa John 's ? Hell no . Never ! If I treat myself to a pizza , I want a thin-crust , Neapolitan-style pizza . I spent quite a while researching the best Neapolitan-style pizza in Seattle and finally settled on Tutta Bella , which has five branches in the Seattle area , and hit the spot . On my list to try next time I 'm in Seattle : Via Tribunali , Pizza Credo and Veraci . <p> 17 Kerry Park <p> Even though I would n't necessarily call this little lookout a park , I 'd definitely recommend visiting it for its amazing views over Seattle 's skyline and Elliott Bay . If you 're lucky and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here . While you 're there , why not check out Queen Anne Ave just a few blocks north of Kerry Park ? The 5 Spot is great for a casual dinner , or further up the road , How To Cook A Wolf is a more upscale Italian restaurant . The aforementioned Storyville coffee shop is also on Queen Anne Ave . <p> 18 Fremont Sunday market <p> I 've already mentioned Fremont , but the Sunday market deserves an extra mention . A mix of flea market , handicraft market and food market , it makes a fantastic Sunday activity and you can easily combine it with a stroll around the rest of the neighborhood . The nearby Milstead &amp; Co has been awarded the title of the best coffee shop in all of Washington several times . <p> 19 Rainbow Crosswalks in Capitol Hill <p> Of course Capitol Hill is n't only worth a visit for its rainbow crosswalks , but also for its lively bar scene . What used to be Seattle 's gayborhood has branched out a little more over the past few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) it is still the city 's prime gay hot spot . <p> 20 Wildrose <p> Speaking of gayborhood " Wildrose is not only Seattle 's only lesbian bar , but also one of the last remaining lesbian bars on the West Coast , and the longest running lesbian bar in the country . Most fun on Wednesdays for karaoke . <p> 21 Espresso Vivace <p> Another outstanding coffee shop and coffee roaster in Seattle , Espresso Vivace has been around since 1988 and has three locations in Seattle . I loved the quiet rooms ' in both locations I visited , and it did n't hurt that their biscotti were mouth-wateringly tasty , too . Vivace was also awarded the title of Washington 's best coffee shop ' . <p> 22 The Gumwall <p> It 's gross , it 's weird , but it is also something you should definitely see . There 's also some cool street art in Post Alley , where the gum wall is , and since it 's right by Pike Place Market , it 'd be silly not to check it out while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And while we 're at it : Pike Place Market is on every Seattle visitor 's to-do-list , I think , and I expected it to be super touristy . However , I was surprised to see just how many locals do their fresh produce shopping here , especially in the fish section . Another surprise : how many good restaurants there are in Pike Place . I loved Country Dough , Pieroshky Pieroshky , Pike Place Chowder , Three Girls Bakery , and I still have some places on my to-do-list for my next visit , like the Pink Door , as I did n't make it there during this visit . <p> 24 Speakeasy Bars <p> I love speakeasy bars , and so I was excited to find out there were quite a few bars in Seattle where I could splurge on a tasty- cocktail in a fancy setting . While I was disappointed that Bathtub Gin does n't have any resemblance to its New York counterpart ( nope , no bathtub in there ! ) , it 's still a speakeasy-style bar . The Needle &amp; Threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most iconic speakeasy bar , so make sure to reserve a table in advance . Backdoor at Roxy 's in the back of Roxy 's Diner in Fremont is another classic speakeasy , as is The Knee High Stocking Company in Capitol Hill . The above mentioned Temperance Bar on top of the Smith Tower is also a speakeasy . <p> 25 Kubota Garden <p> This Japanese Garden in the south of Seattle is the perfect urban oasis . I went for some tranquility and self-reflection and could n't have chosen a better spot . What makes Kubota Garden special ? 20 acre of greenscape that blends Japanese garden concepts with native Northwest plants . And the best thing ? It 's FREE ! <p> 26 El Chupacabra : Burritos &amp; Tacos <p> The best burrito I found during my time in Seattle " I loved the atmosphere in their Phinney Ridge branch ( self-described Mexican cantina with punk rock roots ' " to give you an idea ) , but the Alki Beach branch beats it with its waterfront location . No matter which El Chupacabra ( the 3rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the food and drinks wo n't disappoint . <p> Pie and liquor " need I say more ? A combination that ca n't be beat ! If you do n't care about a drink with your pie , get a slice to go at the take-out window . And if one pie place is n't enough , check out : Pie in Fremont , Pie Bar Ballard ( owned by the twin sisters who own the original Pie Bar in Capitol Hill ) and A La Mode Pies . <p> 29 Columbia City <p> I stumbled upon this neighborhood when somebody recommend Empire Espresso to me , which happens to be in Columbia City . Apparently , it is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the entire country , with European and East African immigrants , Orthodox Jews and other cultural groups . I ended up returning several times to check out other places like Geraldine 's ( great breakfasts ) , Columbia City Bakery and Flying Lion Brewing . I loved the villagy ' feel of Columbia City and how walkable it was . <p> 30 Biscuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Biscuit Bitch has converted me . After eating breakfast there I wanted to go back every single day . They have three branches in Downtown Seattle , including one right by Pike Place Market ( the Belltown branch is usually less busy ) . Expect Southern-Inspired breakfast dishes with an emphasis on , you 've guessed it , biscuits and gravy . Vegetarian ? Gluten-free ? Not a problem ! <p> Yes , another coffee shop ! Caffe Vita recently opened a branch in Bushwick , one of my favorite Brooklyn neighborhoods , and in L.A. 's hip Silver Lake neighborhood , and that 's an indication of what kind of coffee shop Caffe Vita is : definitely a hipster hangout . The small independent coffee roastery focuses on sustainable farm-to-cup relationships with local coffee farmers in Latin America and their baristas are incredibly knowledgeable about the coffee they offer . <p> 32- Freeway Park <p> This might not be Seattle 's prettiest park , but it is surely its most unique : it was built on top of a freeway , as the name suggests . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are intertwined and mixes concrete walls with planting containers and trees . I 've never seen a park like this anywhere in the world . <p> 33 Cowgirl Espresso <p> I ca n't write about Seattle without mentioning the bikini baristas , which are a unique component of Washington and Oregon ( plus one bikini barista coffee shop in Hawaii ) . They 're basically little roadside shacks in which scantily dressed girls serve caffeinated drinks . Even though they 're called bikini baristas , they do n't always wear a bikini " sometimes , it 's just a tiny string and a couple of strategically placed stickers . These coffee shops " despite serving excellent coffee " are n't without controversy , as you might expect , and this video has some insights on bikini baristas , if you 'd like to learn more about them . <p> 34 Microbreweries <p> It was too hard for me to pick only one here , so I 'll just leave you with microbrews in general , and some suggestions . I love that Seattle has a microbrewery in nearly every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relatively small space ( 8 breweries in a 2-mile radius ! ) , and I recommend this brewery crawl as suggest by Thrillist . For a complete list of all microbreweries in Seattle , check out Eater 's Essential Guide To Seattle 's Top Breweries . <p> 35 Starbucks Reserve Roastery &amp; Tasting Room <p> I can feel you 're rolling your eyes now , but hear me out : I have to admit that I never understood the long lines in front of the original Starbucks , the first ever Starbucks in Pike Place Market which is visited by hordes of tourists every day , rain or shine . And I did n't even want to go inside the Reserve Roastery , but one day I happened to walk by there and thought : heck why not . And I was impressed ! It 's nothing like your regular Starbucks . The 15,000-square-foot space is half coffee roaster , half coffee shop , and has a coffee specialty bar where you can order siphon coffee or an espresso flight " things you do n't get at any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found public transportation in Seattle rather difficult to use ( unless you have an unlimited amount of time on your hands ) but the Link Light Rail is pretty good for parts of the city and brings you all the way to the airport for only $2.75 ( runs every 10 mins and takes about 40 mins from downtown to SEA-TAC ) . <p> If you do n't have a car but want to get to some of the further away neighborhoods and attractions , I recommend the Lyft app ( cheaper than Uber and they are nicer ! ) . <p> If you are looking to rent a car , I recommend Rentalcars.com ( they are not paying me to say anything nice about them , I just had a great experience with them on my recent trip to LA and got a great rate ) . Where to stay <p> Most big hotels are right downtown , which is practical for most sightseeing . Check out Booking.com for the best deals . If you 're on a budget , the Green Tortoise is an excellent hostel right by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle and out-of-town , taco nights and other cool extras.Other resources 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

No matter if it was Puget Sound to the West ( which is an inlet of the Pacific Ocean ) or Lake Union between northern Downtown and Fremont , or Lake Washington to the East there 's water everywhere . <p> I even got to check out Greenlake in northern Seattle during my last week in town , which has a great running trail around the lake , but I missed out on the Burke-Gilman Trail along Lake Washington my friends had recommended to me " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but preferably in the summer ) . <p> Two of my favorite running routes : Along Alki Beach in West Seattle , from where you have amazing views over Downtown Seattle , especially during sunset , and Seward Park in the southeastern part of town , which occupies the small forested Bailey peninsula in Lake Washington . This little peninsula is completely covered in a lush rain forest and has not only a trail that runs straight around the peninsula , but also several trail inside the forest , and an amphitheater in a forest clearing on top of the hill .

@@107142831 @2542831/ <h> Life Lately &amp; Upcoming Travels : February 2017 Edition <p> In my monthly round-ups , I am looking back at my travels over the past four weeks , what went well and what did n't , and what 's next for me . <h> Where I 've Been <p> I cant believe that this month had only 28 days it feels like I 've packed so much into February : Tel Aviv , Berlin , Erfurt , Cologne , New York , and in Ecuador Ive already visited Quito , the Gal+pagos Islands , Guayaquil and Monta+ita , where I am right now . I took nine planes , starting the month in the Middle East and ending it in South America : <p> Tel Aviv Berlin <p> Dusseldorf- Lisbon <p> Lisbon NYC <p> NYC Houston <p> Houston Quito <p> Quito Guayaquil <p> Guayaquil- Baltra <p> San Cristobal Baltra <p> Baltra Guayaquil <p> Flying in February included the tiniest plane Ive ever been on and I got to play co-pilot ! <h> What Ive Been Up To <p> This month was a crazy travel month , and yet I managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm not feeling completely exhausted , because I was taking things slow . <p> I wrapped up my Israel trip with a couple of days in Tel Aviv before a whirlwind 24 hours in Berlin to see some friends before leaving Germany . From there , I went to my hometown to say goodbye to my sister and my nephew and packed up everything I needed to get settled in New York City . <p> Flying to NYC from D++sseldorf meant I was able to spend some time with my friend Jo in Cologne , and then I had five days in New York to get a taste of an East Coast winter before escaping to South America . And what a taste I got : I arrived just before a massive blizzard hit New York , the biggest snowstorm Ive ever experienced ! <p> That 's as much winter as I could take ( I had decided not to bring my winter coat because I was going to leave for Latin America after a few short days in NYC ! ) , and luckily I left for Ecuador after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch up with friends , eat some of my favorite foods and treat myself to a cronut ( no pizza though , major fail ! ) . <p> This was the first time I entered the U.S. on my brand new green card , which I was pretty nervous about after the travel ban just a couple of weeks earlier . Who knew if a spontaneous decision to now temporarily ban ALL green card holders from entering the US would come into effect while I was in the air ! But I was let in without any problems , and one of the immigration officers greeted me with a big smile and a Welcome to America ! , but a grumpier officer pointed out that I was lucky to have gotten the green card when I did , mentioning that a bill terminating the Diversity Visa Program ( Green Card Lottery ) had already been presented to Congress . <p> Anyway , after reading way too many stories about immigrants being stranded somewhere , unable to return to their homes and families , all I could think while I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't felt that way in a long time . <p> Arriving in Ecuador felt both terrifying and relieving . On the one hand , I was a bit anxious about traveling by myself for the first time in months , but on the other hand I was craving some alone time after being surrounded by people all the time since mid-December . <p> I started my travels through Ecuador in Quito , which admittedly , did n't  impress me much , and from there I flew down to Guayaquil , the countrys biggest port town , to start my bucket list trip : a four-day cruise through the Gal+pagos Islands . And the trip definitely lived up to my expectations I cant wait to tell you more about all the wildlife , the incredible scenery and life on a 16-passenger yacht . <p> After the cruise I spent a few days in Guayaquil to catch up on work , and yet again I have to say that the city did n't  wow me . The humidity and heat ( even during the night it would n't drop below 80-F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started craving a nice ocean breeze , which is why I decided to go to Monta+ita next , the countrys most popular surf town . <p> Now on to the highlights and lowlights of the month : <h> Highlights <p> Cruising Around the Galapagos Islands <p> The Galapagos Islands have been on my travel wish list for as long as I can remember " as a wildlife and nature lover , this is a must-visit destination . However , the remoteness of the islands and the hefty price tags of the cruises make it difficult to visit the islands " so difficult that only 79,000 people visit the Galapagos every year ! When I got the chance to hop on a four-day cruise ( on a luxury yacht no less ) I did n't think twice . And the islands were everything I had dreamed they 'd be : wildlife galore , and the best thing is that no matter if you 're underwater or on land , the animals do n't really care that you are there and are n't bothered by you . This is how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turtles , manta rays and hundreds of colorful fish . On the islands , I got to hang out with giant tortoises , saw blue-footed boobies , frigate birds and pelicans , watched sea lions own the port towns as if they had been built for them . It was a fascinating experience that I wo n't forget anytime soon.A Writer 's Retreat in the Ecuadorian Cordillera <p> When I said I was taking things slow this month , that 's mainly because I had to get a lot of writing done , which I can only do when I am settled in a tranquil place where I do n't have a lot of distractions . So when I stumbled upon a center for artists on AirBnb , nestled into the mountains near the beach town of Monta+ita , I thought it was perfect for a writer 's retreat . A little cabin with a desk , a hammock to swing in , but not much else , except for hikes to nearby villages . The place itself is gorgeous " only a few cabins , set in a lush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the perfect getaway for a few days to get some writing done , including my monthly round-up.Gorgeous Spring Days In Tel Aviv <p> Oh Tel Aviv ! My love affair with Israels second city is still going strong and has n't  faded one bit since my last visit . I started the month in Tel Aviv and was blessed with glorious weather which meant I could go on long beach runs , cycle along the coast line and simply wander the streets of the city . Having been to Tel Aviv twice before , I did n't  feel the pressure to do a whole bunch of sightseeing instead , i revisited old favorites such as the Florentin neighborhood for street art , Carmel market to pick up some goodies to bring back to Germany , and Old Jaffa because the ancient port town is still one of my favorite parts of Tel Aviv.24 Hours in Berlin <p> I only had a mere 24 hours in Berlin just enough to catch up with a few friends and to do some of my favorite things : go for a run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food ( I always eat Vietnamese food when I 'm in Berlin , its so good there ! ) , and soak in the special Berlin aura it just does n't  feel like anywhere else in Germany.A Snow day in New York <p> One thing I 'd been worried about with regards to moving to New York more permanently ? Winter . The long , harsh east coast winters . After having escaped winter for so many years , I asked myself if I could really survive an entire winter in New York , but I actually enjoyed my first ever real blizzard and a couple of snow days . <p> This might have been because of the novelty of it , but I am now less worried about going stir-crazy in the winter months . Of course I will try to continue to get away during the colder months , but once I 'm more settled , I have to face that I might not be able to go on a three-month winter escape anymore well see . <p> Luckily I had picked up a warm vest in Cologne before boarding my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have died in my thin summer jacket . <h> Lowlights <p> Skyroam Fail <p> I was n't sure how I 'd feel about being offline for four days on the Gal+pagos Islands , especially during a busy work month like I 'm having this month . So I was happy I remembered my new Skyroam device , a hotspot you can use to connect to wifi in over 100 countries only to find out that its not working in Ecuador ! <p> Do I really need Wi-Fi here ? <p> What I discovered during my forced digital detox was that the world does n't  end when I 'm offline for a few days and that I should make it a point to disconnect more often . It felt good not to be glued to my phone the whole time ! However , dealing with 250 emails upon my return to Wifi-land was quite overwhelming and that was a small number because I was on the cruise over a weekend . <p> Losing Stuff <p> This has been an ongoing thread in my monthly round-ups : barely a month goes by without me losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without losing anything or leaving anything on public transportation ( like my laptop on a plane in December ! ) . But this month , I managed to lose something important : I left a little bag in which I store my electronics in my Airbnb in Berlin and was n't able to recover it before flying to New York . This bag has everything from various charger cords to SD cards to my camera charger . I had to replace everything before my trip to Ecuador , but I hope that I can recover the bag when I get back to Germany however , that wont be any time soon . <p> Cheers to not losing anything else after that incident at the beginning of the month <h> Other Happenings <p> No Coffee February <p> No-Coffee-February was so much harder than No-Booze-January ! I guess that shows me where my addictive tendencies really lie . On my first day without caffeine I got such a bad headache in the afternoon that I was already ready to give up . If you 've ever experienced caffeine withdrawal headaches , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and fought the craving for coffee , despite jet lag and tiredness . It got easier as the month went on , but whenever the smell of freshly roasted coffee hit my nose , I wanted a cup of coffee so bad . Since I do n't drink soda ( Coke ) and do n't drink black tea , I went nearly caffeine-free for the longest time since 2004 , but I did drink green tea which still has caffeine , albeit much less than coffee . <p> Interestingly enough , I did n't feel the urge to drink alcohol after staying off it all of January , which is a good thing , I guess . But the few times that I had a drink it usually made me feel terrible ( headaches ) and super sleepy . <p> I am now looking forward to my first cup of coffee , but being in a beach town means there is usually not a lot of good coffee around , and I am a coffee snob , which means I might even extend my coffee detox for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coffee . Both will be off limits next month . <p> In March I 'll take it easier with a no-chocolate month , which should n't be all that difficult considering most chocolate I 've seen in Ecuador so far is cheap and made of more sugar than cacao , but then looking at this photo I might be a little too confident here . <p> Business Ups &amp; Downs <p> After months of frustration over the company that hosts my website , who kept shutting my site down , I thought I had finally resolved these issues last fall . But this month , they shut my site down for over 24 hours , and that happened while I was in the middle of negotiating a new business contract . Of course it does n't look great when a client wants to work with you ca n't access your site . And who knows what other opportunities I missed out on because of that . <p> On the upside , I did have my most lucrative month in a very long time thanks to two new contracts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope it stays like this , but usually my income fluctuates a lot , so I am not overly confident.Features <p> I 'm still enjoying Pepo , a new chat app that I downloaded last month which connects you with people who share your passions ranging from topics like food and street art to travel . I created a Globetrottergirls chat ( boys are welcome to join , too ? ) in which I talk about travel , share favorite places and travel tips and answer your questions . You can also start a private chat with me on Pepo . I 'd love to see you in my public chat and have you join the conversation . <h> What 's Next For Me <p> I will be spending the entire month in Ecuador , and because the country is so tiny , it means I can take my time in each place and slowly make my way from Vilcabamba in the south to Otavalo in the north .

However this UNESCO World Heritage Site is enjoyed , it is guaranteed to impress . A truly outstanding natural spectacle . <h> Iguazu Falls ( Argentina and Brazil , South America ; 82 metres ) <p> At 82 metres , Iguazu Falls is much shorter than many of the worlds tallest waterfalls , but what it lacks in height it makes up for in volume , especially during the rainy season , when the Rio Iguazu can swell up to eight times its usual size .

Comprising four main channels ( Devils Cataract , Main Falls , Rainbow Falls and Eastern Cataract ) and flowing into the Zambezi River , Victoria Falls is visited by approximately 2.5 million tourists every year . Many people head to Zimbabwe for safari holidays but if you are planning a trip to the country , be sure to include Victoria Falls on your holiday itinerary ! <h> Oloupena Falls ( Hawaii , USA ; 900 metres ) <p> Situated on the gorgeous Hawaiian island of Molokai , Oloupena Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth highest waterfall in the world behind Angel Falls , Tugela Falls ( South Africa ) and Cataratas las Tres Hermanas ( Peru ) .

The waterfall does not boast an especially high flow rate or water density , but its relatively gentle trickle can be enjoyed by land , sea or air ( helicopter ) . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142833 @2542833/ <h> How to get around Germany on the Cheap <p> Even though Germany is compact , the main cities are flung right across it in all directions . On any given trip , you 'll likely have to take at least a couple of mid-length trips. - Travel within Germany can be pricy but only if you do n't  plan in advance . As long as you know your travel dates and all your options , you can cut down your travel costs to a fraction of what they would be otherwise . <p> During the couple of months I spend in Germany every year , I have used every transportation option myself and have compiled them all here for you to know your options and to help you get the best prices on transportation to get around Germany . <h> Trains in Germany <p> You might dream of traveling Europe by train and nowhere is train travel more comfortable or efficient than Germany . But prices have skyrocketed- in the last few years . There are still good deals to be had , but these usually are only valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultramodern ICE trains , and involve changing trains at least once during your journey . <p> Either way , you need to book in advance . Show up at the train station today and try to book a train form Munich to Berlin , and you 'll have to fork out G125 . If you book this journey two weeks in advance instead , you can get the same ticket for as low as- G29 , which is almost G100 cheaper ! <p> The- Deutsche Bahn website- has a good English language section where you can check train times and prices , but you will still have to know the German names of the cities or you wont be able to search , i.e. M++nchen instead of Munich , K+ln instead of Cologne . <p> Trains in Germany <p> Look beyond the standard tickets it offers as well . If you 're planning a weekend getaway , you can buy a Weekend-Ticket for G42 which allows unlimited travel for up to five people on regional trains all weekend long ! If you divide the ticket by 5 and take two trips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how far you travel ! A similar ticket is the Quer-durchs-Land ticket , which offers unlimited train travel on slow trains for 24 hours . The ticket is- G50 for two people and G56 for three people , which breaks down to G18.60 per person and gets proportionally cheaper the more people share it . <p> Some cities also offer special tourist cards , like the Cologne WelcomeCard which is G9.00 and offers 24 hours of free travel on all trains , subways , buses and trams in Cologne , plus discounts of up to 50% on museums , tours and attractions . <p> Deutsche Bahn- offers Germany-only- rail passes- ( as opposed to the popular European rail passes many use ) but we find them to be pretty expensive compared to all the other ticket options , unless you plan to take the train often or are under 25 . <h> Buses in Germany <p> The Deutsche Bahn effectively held a monopoly on public transportation until January 1 , 2013 , which is when German law allowed the creation of private companies to compete with the DB. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper tickets compared to the train , making bus travel in Germany suddenly a very attractive option . <p> If you decide , with two days notice , to go from Frankfurt to Munich , the train starts at G69 ( $92 ) . Bus fares for the same journey start at G20 ( $26 ) . <p> Buses from Berlin to Leipzig are- G8 , Berlin to Hamburg- G9 , or G22 for a ticket all the way down to Munich . You can even go all the way to Innsbruck in Austria from Munich for as low as G8 ! Check out Flixbus- or consider- EuroLines for international routes . We compared bus prices for our routes using GoEuro.com The site has an overview of which buses cover which routes and compares costs of each company the site is super easy to navigate and the comparison tool will save you so much money . <p> Just type in your date and your origin and destination , and it will show you a list of all your options and how much they cost . Then you can head straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book your trip there . Its important to book your trips in advance , since similar to budget airlines , prices go up closer to the date of travel . <p> By the way:GoEuro does n't  only compare bus prices , but it shows you all available options : buses , trains and flights . You can sort the results by cheapest , smartest and fastest , and sometimes there are flights that are nearly as cheap as the bus tickets ( see screenshot below ) . <h> Carpooling <p> Around the same price as a bus , sometimes even cheaper and always cheaper than the train , are Germany 's many carpooling services . Carpooling is very popular in Germany not surprisingly since it relies on a green mentality and is common sense . Drivers have extra seats in their car , you need to get to the same destination why not split the cost of gas and drive together ? <p> Drivers post their trip on a carpooling site , including departure time and per-passenger cost . People looking for rides along the same route call , text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . Most of these sites have an English version and even offer rides on European routes , like Berlin " Warsaw , Munich " Florence or Hamburg " Stockholm . Some of our favorite carpooling websites include BlaBlaCar , Flinc.org , Mitfahrangebot , Mifaz , Mfg-Buddy and Drive2day for all of Europe ( all in English ) . If you speak German , you 'll benefit from an even wider variety , with services such as BesserMitfahren or Fahrgemeinschaft.de . <p> Our comfy carpooling ride which we found on BlaBlaCar . <p> The advantage of carpooling over buses is that you can be very spontaneous deciding to head from Frankfurt to Stuttgart tomorrow ? No problem , youll- definitely still find a ride at the same price as an advance bus ticket would cost . <p> Get a German SIM card for Carpooling , Hitchhiking and Wi-Fi <p> If you decide to carpool , you 'll need a cell phone to take calls and text about pick up points , etc . You can pick up a German SIM card for as little as G5 including credit ( usually the card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount supermarkets such as Lidl or Aldi . <p> You just top up your card as needed , and since rates are very competitive , you probably wont use more than G10 credit per month . SIM cards with data are a little bit more expensive , but make sense if you want to use the carpooling , train or bus apps during your travels . Fellow traveler Kash breaks down all SIM card options in Germany including data in this post . Another advantage to having a German SIM is that while there is free Wi-Fi almost everywhere , often times you need to have a code texted to your cell for access . No cell phone , no free Wi-Fi so avoid that catch-22 and get a German SIM card ! <h> Hitchhiking in Germany <p> Hitchhiking in Germany is way more widespread and socially accepted than in the U.S. and other countries . If you are on an extremely tight budget or just up for adventure , hitchhiking in Germany is possible , safe and a legitimate option . You cant wait on the highway ( Autobahn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at service areas along the highway . There are sometimes 10 , 20 , even more than 30 people at popular pick-up spots , so you might consider using websites like- Hitchwiki- or the- iThumb App- to find a ride before you even leave . <h> Car rentals in Germany <p> If you do n't  want to trust the daredevil German drivers with your life and prefer driving your own car , check out the special weekend offers from the big car rental companies such as Hertz , or check out Expedia-owned CarRentals.com for the best deals across all car rental companies . We have taken advantage of deals for G14.99 per day from Friday to Monday and weekend flat rates as well . If you are driving a long distance , why not post your trip up on one of the carpooling websites and make your gas money back taking a few local Germans with you ! <p> Our rental car in Southern Germany <h> Car Sharing in Germany <p> Car sharing services have exploded in popularity over the years , but for the short-term visitor , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Essentially , car sharing involves being able to rent a car for an hour or half a day any time you want . Cars are usually in convenient locations around the cities , you do n't  have to find a rental office and you can book at short notice for as low as G5 per hour via an app on your smartphone . The problem is that you have to register with the company of your choice . <p> The registration fee is usually around G29 , so it makes more sense for longer stays in the country . Once you do have it , you can shop , get out to the countryside or take a quick morning trip anywhere at the drop of a hat . Some car sharing services worth checking out are : Car2Go ( in seven German cities ; famous for their fleet of Smart cars ) Cambio ( in 13 German cities ) , DriveNow ( car sharing by BMW in Germanys five largest cities ) , or Flinkster ( the official car sharing service of Deutsche Bahn with cars in over 140 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no registration fee ! ) . <h> Flights <p> Flying usually does n't  make much sense in Germany thanks to the countrys compact size , but if you want to save time and are traveling popular routes like Berlin Stuttgart or Hamburg Munich , its worth checking Germanwings- for- flights within Germany from G39.99 ( booked around four weeks in advance , sometimes there are even cheaper deals ) . If you are planning to take trips from Germany to another destination in Europe , most cities are served by the major budget airlines , such as Easyjet , Ryanair or Germanwings . <p> Ryanair we dislike it , but we use it . <h> Where to stay <p> If you are trying to travel for as little money as possible , check out the Couchsurfing scene in the cities you 're planning to visit . Germanys got quite an active Couchsurfing community , and if you do n't  get any responses to your requests , make them more personal . Germans do n't  like getting swamped with generic requests instead , they are looking to make real connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their couch though , you can consider him or her a friend for life . <p> A similarly authentic travel experience is Airbnb , which to me feels almost like Couchsurfing when I rent a room in somebodys apartment ( instead of the entire apartment ) . I 've found that in Germany , private rooms in an Airbnb usually only cost a couple of Euros more than a bed in a hostel dorm bed and even though I enjoy staying in hostels , sometimes I appreciate having my own room and not having to share a bathroom with a dozen other people . <p> If you do n't  have an Airbnb account yet , sign up through my referral link and get up to $40 off your first booking ! <p> Both Couchsurfing and Airbnb have helped me make my travel experience more genuine and interesting and get a better idea of what life in the place I 'm visiting is really like . In a hotel , you 'll never have your host randomly invite you to a party with locals , or to join them on a bar hopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take me out , they always give me great recommendations for places to check out which are n't necessarily on the beaten tourist path . <p> Over the years , I 've found it increasingly difficult to find couches to sleep on , especially in popular destinations , which is why I now prefer renting a room in an Airbnb apartment , instead of renting the entire apartment . That way , I get the chance to connect with my host , and when I travel solo I do n't need an entire apartment to myself . I always want to meet new people though . And that 's what I also appreciate Couchsurfing for : their groups and meet-ups . So even if I do n't couchsurf with someone , I can still go to a meet-up and connect with other travelers . <p> Have you traveled in Germany ?

@@107142834 @2542834/ <h> Why Spain is our go-to destination for a European weekend getaway <p> Our hearts go out to our friends and family in the northern hemisphere right now . Snow and below zero temperatures day after day at the end of March ? When will this winter ever end and whatever happened to March going out like a lamb ? ! <p> Its even snowing in London , which only ever happened twice in the three years we called the city home . Even so , the long , gray winters took their toll on us back then , which is why we got very good at escaping on short breaks . Sometimes we based our decision on where to go on cheap deals we found with budget airlines . Doing this we flew to- Scandinavia , France , Scotland , Germany and Austria , to name a few . <p> But sometimes we knew exactly what we needed and exactly where to get it . Our favorite European weekend getaway by far was ( and is ) always Spain . No matter where we went Madrid , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we needed to recharge our batteries : bright sun , good food ( and wine ! ) and satisfaction for our inner culture vulture . <p> The winter before becoming nomads , for example , an amazing last minute vacation deal in Spain caught my attention and just thirty minutes later I had booked a long Easter weekend getaway to a small town in southern Spain near Malaga . For just 199EUR , the deal included return flights for the two of us and 5 nights in a vacation apartment with terrific ocean views , just five minutes from the beach . <p> Another time , we escaped a dreary London autumn for a ten-day train in Spain getaway . We flew to Seville , took the train up to Madrid and then over to Barcelona and flew back to London from there . Whether we go for a sun and sand or city break escape , Spain never disappoints . So for those of you who are looking for a spontaneous escape at the moment , read on for why we think Spain is your best bet . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Northern Europe , Spain benefits from its Mediterranean climate . Even in the coldest months of January and February , southern Spain has average daily temps of 15 C ( 60 F ) and 20-22 days of sun each month . <h> The prices <p> Spain has always been an affordable destination , but in recent years the dire economic situation has meant even more deals can be found for hotels and tours looking to fill up in a financial crisis . Traditionally a summer destination for Europeans , Spain has hundreds of thousands of hotel rooms that need to be filled during the months outside of June-September . We easily found rooms at half-price or better after all , a booked room is always better for a hotel than an empty room . <h> The food <p> You cant go wrong with Spanish cheese , wine and olives , and though omnivores often indulge in Spanish ham and other meats , we love love love Spanish tapas from green peppers in sea salt to our all-time favorite , Tortilla Espanola ( Spanish Omelette ) . The best thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <h> The people <p> We find that Spaniards are some of the most welcoming people in all of Europe , though this perception might have been skewed coming from London where no one talks to each other . Either way , in Spain we were always welcomed with smiles and people chatting with us , showing genuine interest in our story and where we are from , and sharing their stories with us as well . <h> The culture <p> Spain is one of the most culturally diverse countries in Europe " Barcelona is nothing like Madrid , Oviedo is nothing like Bilbao . Little towns in the countryside could n't be more different from the beach side resorts , and no matter where you go , cities are rich with historical buildings , beautiful 15th- century churches and region-specific- architecture . More than anything we love how many places in Spain combine the all-in-one beach and city escapes we crave like Barcelona , Valencia or Malaga . A weekend in Barcelona can be themed around Gaudi , or you can take in some world-class art galleries in Madrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish , Muslim and Christian culture in Toledo . Most cities in Spain are small enough to be explored in a day or two and we could live in a self-catering apartment on the beach for weeks at a time . <h> The Transportation <p> Spains high-speed AVE train network connects all the dots on the map , both large and small , making it super easy to criss-cross the country and stop off wherever you 'd like , easily combining two cities during one visit , like we did Barcelona and Madrid are within a two hour reach , or you can head down to the coast after a visit to the Moorish Alhambra Palace and a couple of days in Granada . And if you book your train tickets in advance , they are quite inexpensive , as are flights with all the well-known budget airlines that connect major Spanish cities both to each other as well as to cities throughout Europe .

@@107142835 @2542835/ <h> Walking through Italy : Highlights from the Via Amerina , Part I <p> It was a special moment when I was handed my pilgrim 's pass in the Papal Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels in Assisi " even though I am not religious . But it made it official : I would be walking along the Via Amerina , a historic pilgrim 's route , for the next six days , until we would reach Rome , the ultimate destination for a pilgrim . <p> Assisi is an important sacred place for pilgrims because St Francis , the founder of the Order of Friars Minor , the women 's Order of Saint Clare , the Third Order of Saint Francis and the Custody of the Holy Land , and one of the most venerated religious figures in history , was born and died here.Several pilgrims ' trails start or pass through Assisi , inspired by the life and the travels of St Francis " most famously the St Francis Way , a 340 miles ( 550km ) pilgrimage from Florence through Assisi to Rome through Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amerina may include several spiritual sites , like churches and monasteries , but of course you do n't have to be religious to enjoy the walk through the Italian countryside . Just like on the Camino De Santiago , Spain 's famous pilgrim 's route , you find people of all ages , nationalities and backgrounds , and everyone is walking for a different reason . Some are at a crossroads in their life , looking for a sign of which way to take . Some are walking to process a dramatic event in their lives . Some are walking to focus on spiritual virtues , of course , and others walk simply because they enjoy walking.Whatever the reason , the one thing we all share is the journey . The dirt roads across the Umbrian hills , the paths along the vineyards , where vines heavy with ripe grapes are waiting to be harvested . The walk along deserted country roads , through grain fields , and through little Italian villages that barely get any tourists , save the few pilgrims that walk this ancient trail . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amerina dates back to Roman times , when it was built following the route of an ancient Etruscan trading trail . The Romans paved the entire road with big basalt rocks , some of which are still there today . Several times along the way I found myself walking on the original basalt rocks . <p> What made the road so important during medieval times was the fact that it was the only route that was open between Rome and Ravenna , which was the capital of the Byzantine Empire at the time.The trail also has a connection to other European roads : the Via Francigena meets the Via Amerina just outside of Rome , combining the two ancient routes on their last miles to the Vatican.And there are many more than just these two medieval roads " there 's a number of Roman roads that lead to Rome , all of which were important trading routes in Roman and medieval times , connecting major religious and commercial hubs , like Rome with Jerusalem . Five routes that are particularly noteworthy in Italy are the Way of St Francis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Via Francigena and Via Amerina , parts of which I walked.Day after day , we got up , put on our walking shoes and faced the challenge of another long and strenuous section of the path . I was surprised that we did n't pass any other hikers , but the Via Amerina , despite its historic significance , is n't among the most popular multi-day walking routes in Europe . The Camino , the Pilgrim Way to Canterbury or the Via Francigena , a longer version of the Via Amerina that goes from France to Rome , are much more popular . <p> Italy Beyond The Major Cities <p> The little towns we stopped in along the way are towns that most visitors to Italy would never set foot in " towns like Nepi , Gallese or Orte are n't places you find on your typical Italy itinerary . There 's no Florence , no Venice , no Milan . Instead , you get a glimpse into what small-town life looks like in Italy , where the food and wine in the trattorias comes right from the fields surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop for a chat in the town square , have a quick espresso in one of the ever-present espresso bars.That 's what I loved most about this walk , getting a deeper insight into the real Italy , the country beyond landmarks like the Leaning Tower of Pisa or the Colosseum . This walk is a spiritual journey for pilgrims , but for me , it was a cultural and culinary pilgrimage , in search of authentic dishes of Umbria and Latium , the regions I traversed , and in search of cultural treasures that are overlooked by most guide books.The total distance between Rome and the town of Amelia , after which the route was named ( Amelia was known as Ameria in Roman times ) was 59 miles ( 95 kilometers ) . Just north of Amelia , the Via converges with two other ancient routes , the Via Flaminia , which continues to the Adriatic Coast , and the Via Cassia . Eventually , the Via Flaminia was extended all the way to Rome , and with a better surface , it led to the decline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Via is now seeing a revival , and is becoming increasingly popular again with hikers and cyclists . And you do n't have to walk the entire length of it , you could also base yourself in Amelia or Civita Castellana or another town along the route , and walk sections of it.But before I tell you the practical aspects on how you can walk the Via Amerina yourself , I wanted to share some of my personal highlights along the way . <p> Assisi : Where it all Begins <p> I wish we would have had more time in Assisi to also see the famous Papal Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi , which is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Order of Friars Minor Conventual and a UNESCO World Heritage site , but with a long walk ahead of us , we only got to stop briefly in Assisi , receive our pilgrims passports and visit the Papal Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels . <p> While this church might not have the stunning views of the more famous Papal Basilica of Saint Francis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is the seventh largest Christian church and it was here that the young Francis of Assisi understood his vocation and renounced the world in order to live in poverty among the poor , consequently starting the Franciscan movement . <p> Another thing that makes the church stand out : The chiesetta ( little church ) of Porziuncola ( Italian for " little portion " ) which is the most sacred place for Franciscans . Benedictine monks gave this little church , dating from the 9th century , to St Francis.While we received our pilgrims ' passes in Assisi , the actual start of the walk for us was Castel dell'Aquila , where we left the old town through the remarkable medieval Porta Amerina and started our walk south , towards Rome . <p> Scenic Umbria <p> Umbria is a region I had only passed through on previous visits to Italy , but never really explored . I was surprised to see that its natural beauty compared very much to neighboring Tuscany , which has always been my favorite part of Italy . <p> The leg of the walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just under 10 miles ( 15.4km ) was possibly the most picturesque day of the hike , but in all honesty , I would be hard pressed picking a favorite . Italy is always just ridiculously scenic , no matter what part of the country you find yourself in . <p> On our walk through the hilly countryside we would see tiny sandstone villages perched on the hillsides , always with a campanile , a bell tower , sticking out . <p> We walked through fields , through vineyards , we passed olive orchards and small farms . I felt like the saying It is about the journey , not the destination ' never held more true than here , where every time we turned a corner , we were rewarded with new breathtaking vistas . <p> Amelia : Sweeping Views Over The Tiber Valley <p> Amelia , ( formerly America ) , sits , like most towns in Umbria , on top of a hill , overlooking the surrounding Tiber Valley . A group of local flag-twirlers dressed in period costumes welcomed us with a traditional musical performance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good that they participate in competitions around the world.I love that all the medieval towns still have traditional contrade groups a contrada is a district , or a ward , within an Italian city " and during medieval festivals which are usually held in the summer , members of the various contrade dress in ceremonial garb and parade through the cities.Like most Baroque churches in Italy , Amelia 's cathedral was impressive , with intricate paintings and lots of gold . I may not be religious , but I do have an appreciation for elaborate churches that are hundreds of years old " and I never tired of walking into another house of worship on our way to Rome.Amelia was so delightful that I could have easily spent another day here , but the Via called , and so we marched onward instead , to Orte , around 10 miles ( 17 kilometers ) south of Amelia . <h> PIN IT ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Some of you have already suspected it , and some of you even got in touch and asked what was going on ( I appreciate your emails ) .

I have been trying to write about it for weeks , but always ended up with many tears and few written words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and it will take me a while to get over this . <p> What happened ? <p> We had just overcome the effects of a horrible sickness and a somewhat frustrating travel experience in Bolivia , but were on a high again in Peru where we fell in love with Cuzco and went on to have one of the most rewarding travel experiences of all of our travels : finishing the five-day Salkantay Trek to Machu Picchu . <p> The last picture of us as a couple : Reaching Machu Picchu after a five day trek through the Andres <p> Just a few days later , we had an argument that blew up to such dimensions that I found myself on a plane to Germany a week later while Jess flew to her family in Chicago .

My little nieces are so adorable that they are always able to dry my tears " they do n't even know how much they have done for me . <p> In March , I returned to Berlin , a city Jess and I had chosen as a potential future base for the two of us after falling in love with the city last summer , spent a month there and was happy to discover that I still loved the city just as much , and will probably make it my home base sooner or later . <p> I took the opportunity to spend a week in Malta last month where I was able to reflect on our relationship and the break-up , finding closure and also rediscovering my love for travel and exploring new places , something that had disappeared after the break up . <p> For the foreseeable future , I will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heal and figure out what I want to do with my life . I have to admit that I am not a good solo traveler and it will take me a while to transform from a couple traveler ' into a solo traveler ' . <p> When I was offered a housesit in New York City ( where we had a housesit together last May/June ) I did n't think about it twice and will be spending the next couple of months in the city I 'd move to in a heartbeat . New York City is easily my favorite place in the world , and I am hoping that spending time in a place I love and I am familiar with will not only help me heal but also help me ease in becoming a solo traveler .

In the beginning , I had a breakdown every time I published a post on a place we visited together , and had a hard time looking at the pictures and video footage of our last adventures as a couple . I was n't sure I wanted to keep the site , but realized quickly that I ca n't picture my life without Globetrottergirls . I will continue to share my last trips with Jess , but will also begin to share my own travels as I transition into being a solo female traveler . The stories of our last trips as a couple deserve being told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in over the next few weeks , whenever I am ready to share them , since it is still extremely painful for me to go through those pictures and relive the good times we had . <p> The emails and comments I 've been receiving were a big part of what kept me going over the last few months , what kept me sane and helped me rediscover my love for writing , sharing stories and help you plan your own dream trip , and I wanted to take the opportunity to thank everyone who emailed asking for travel advice , telling us wed inspired them to go on their own dream trip , or just checking in to see if everything was okay with us . <p> If any of you would like to get in touch with Jess , please just shoot me an email and I 'd be happy to forward you her contact details . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 73 Comments <h> Comment navigation <p> Sorry to hear of the breakup .

The independence and self-reliance couldnt have come about in a better way . It may seem a lot harder doing it on your own , but there are some major advantages , too . Travel can be such a stressful activity and making decisions for yourself is strengthening . <p> At the same time you have my utmost sympathy for your situation , having forever lost the person closest to me and all that entailed .

I 've just discovered your blog today , so I 'm an ultra new reader , but I just wanted to offer my condolences for the experience you went through . It sounds terribly hard . Its always difficult to break up with a long term partner , but as you pointed out , you lost more than just your girlfriend . I just want to say that I think its great that you decided to continue on with the blog , as I think you have a real talent , and I am looking forward to keeping up with your adventures as you continue on as an awesome solo traveller . <p> hi dani , i would like to say i 'm sad for you , but in truth I am hoping that you like to switch teams and give the blokes a go . ive followed you for some time . i sat across from you on many buses hoping that one day you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply Dani , both meeting you yesterday and now reading this .

I have loved your website and found it very inspirational and helpful . We recently sold our house and are embarking on a 5 month trip with our 4 young children to Central America . We used your packing list as a baseline for our trip . Your blogs on Central America have been instrumental in piecing together our trip . Thank you for sharing . I wish you the best in the future . <p> Hi Dani Im new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as I have just gone/going through a very similar situation after almost ten years . Writing a relatively short post about it without going too deep ( Everything Happens For a Reason ) was hard , not to mention what to do with the blog ( when its been built upon you and your partner , even if its only in its infancy ) . Being blindsided by warning signs and thinking that a relationship will last forever , whatever gets thrown in its way , then being thrown a curve ball that you have very little , actually no say in , is a huge shock emotionally and physically . It will take time to process your emotions and I am being advised repeatedly to let whatever comes out emotionally to just be . Ha , even writing this has opened the valve again ! I encourage you to continue with the blog , as hard as it is . Sending you a big virtual hug = <p> Dani , How do I say how sorry I am ? I am more understanding than you might imagine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am in the middle of a 36 year marriage that has become so full of discord , that we are beyond repair . I am just beginning the process of cleansing my desperation and sadness , I might add at the age of 65 . <p> I am totally and utterly devoid of feeling and thought and need to find a way to move on . My only salvation is we have three wonderful sons that can hopefully get past my issues . I unfortunately can not afford to live in the US and will have to see where I can live and retire on my meager social security income . <p> I wish you the best in your recovery and urge you to make contact if you find the need ! Thank you kindly for sharing your issue . It helped me understand I am not alone ! Mike <p> Oh Dani , I noticed a little while ago that Jess was missing but assumed it was temporary . So rather belatedly I 'd like to say how sorry I am . Really sad to read this but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch-up with some more recent posts to see how things are now ( good I hope ) . <p> Ive been through two big break ups in my life ( both their decision rather than mine ) . The first time being by far the worse when I lost my husband , job and home in one blow . It took a long , long time to really move on but I did . <p> I 've never been so happy in my own company as I am now ( although I am engaged to a very lovely man , were not planning on living together 24/7 when we finally tie the knot ) . <p> Wishing you well and look forward to catching-up with your journey . Love Kat x <p> I 'm so sorry that you and Jess broke up . I just commented on your post written in 2010 about the double or twin bed issues . And I really feel bad that I began with the " Hey ladies " sentence ! I apologize for that ! <p> I hope you have or will overcome this breakup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( especially to new places places you have n't been together before ) will certainly help you get through it ! <p> Have fun at the Oktoberfest in Munich ! Ca n't wait to know where you 're traveling to in November &amp; December . = In the meantime , I 'll keep reading your old posts . <p> I am so sorry to hear about this hard time in your life . I can empathize . When me and my ex-wife split , it was unbelievably painful . Even now many years later I can barely speak to her because it is still painful . <h> Comment navigation 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107142842 @2542842/ <p> A picture may be worth a thousand words , but no pictures of Perito Moreno Glacier could quite have captured the truly spectacular nature of a visit to one of the few growing glaciers in the world . <p> 50 miles ( 80km ) from Perito Moreno , the city of El Calafate , Argentina pales in comparison to the attraction that fills its hotels and restaurants with tourists and serves as not much more than a comfortable base for the many tourist attractions and activities in the area . We booked a tour immediately upon arrival and headed out early the next morning in the white tourist van toward the ever-present Andes Mountains . <p> An hour later we arrived at - Los Glaciares National Park and stopped at the first viewpoint of the glacier . Being able to see so much ice from so far away made us realize just how massive this field of ice is : roughly 18 miles ( 29 km ) long and three miles ( 5 km ) wide , and at its tallest point , reaching over 240ft ( 73m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20-story building ! We would n't be able to grasp all of that information from this distance just yet . <p> The van pulled in to a marina for one of two major parts of the tour , an hour-long boat ride to get within 200m of the end of the glacier . While it was already fairly warm when we boarded at 10am , just ten minutes into the ride we were already starting to freeze as we neared the glacier . The boat finally stopped in front of this incredible wall of ice and the temperature dropped shockingly low.There we stood , wrapped in jackets , scarves , clutching our cameras with frozen hands , floating in front of a field of ice that is 97 square miles ( 250km2 ) and the 240 feet of ice above water is literally only the icing on the cake , as the sheet of ice actually reaches 2,297 feet at its deepest points . <p> Although we now stood close enough to feel the true size of the freezing , gargantuan glacier , we could have actually trekked right across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) type of tour . Instead we opted to spend the day on the miles and miles of viewing platforms that zig-zag up and down the side of the hill just across the water , facing the glacier . As we stood there taking it all in , several groups of ice trekkers looked surreal , the size of ants , as they crunched their way across the permafrost of the ice field in front of us . <p> The boat ride is a must-do , but we could have spent the whole day traversing the walkways . At first I wondered how long you could possibly want to stare at a big chunk of ice , but there is nothing else like it in the world . The glacier is like a living , breathing being.It moves two meters a day , and is actually growing in size . As the heat of the sun warms up the glacier 's edge , more and more giant blocks of ice fall off splashing into the water . The process , called calving , creates endless entertainment , as each deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges in size from a small car to a small building . <p> The waves from the fall move outward and back in again , which carves out a tunnel beneath the glacier a bit at a time . As the tunnel deepens , it undermines the stability of the tunnel , water flowing deeper underneath until , every once in a while , a massive piece of ice bursts off the end of the glacier . <p> Even when small ice cubes plop in to the water , the cracking sound is so loud we can hear it from any part of the viewing platform . When the pieces are bigger , the sound is so humbling that the most animalistic part of you is instinctively reminded just how small your place on earth really is . <p> Chunks of ice that could have taken down the Titanic float in front of the glacier in the lake , melting ever so slowly in the freezing cold water . <p> Although it seems counter-intuitive , the chunks calve off the glacier because it is one of the few in Patagonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expands those 30-odd kilometers in the back , small chunks break off in the front . <p> We wondered why the ice was blue and thought it was temperature related . On the contrary , it is related to age the bluer the ice , the older the part of the glacier . <p> What makes Perito Moreno all the more impressive is that it actually belongs to the Southern Patagonian Ice Field ( shared between Chile and Argentina ) that feeds in to a total of 48 glaciers and makes the world 's largest fresh water reserve . <h> A GlobetrotterGirls Day Trip <h> How to visit Perito Moreno Glacier <p> Several tour agencies in El Calafate offer tours to the glacier . There are three types : <p> 1 ) The basic option with only the walkways- no boat 2 ) The walkways plus a boat tour 3 ) Ice trekking on the glacier . <p> Our friends from Indefinite Adventure had visited the glacier just before us and had found that MundoAustral offers the best prices ( ARS$180/US$35 for the basic tour or ARS$230/US$45 incl. the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was able to beat that price . <p> Note : The entrance fee to the park , ARS$130/US$25 as of 1 March 2013 , is not included in any of the tours.You can also take a public bus to the park , which leaves from El Calafate at 8.00am and returns from the park at 4.00pm . Return tickets are ARS$145/US$28 . The boat trip can be booked in the park for ARS90/US$17 . Ice climbing is offered by several tour operators in El Calafate and starts at around ARS$600/US$115 . <p> Tip : We recommend taking a complete tour to the park , at least if you are planning to take the boat trip . We paid ARS$230 for our package " transport to and from the park , plus the boat tour booked separately , would cost ARS$235 , and with the tour you get explanations from professional tour guides , plus you stop at several locations inside and outside the park , and get hotel pick up and drop off . <p> Food : There is a cafeteria inside the park , but the food is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpriced . Bring your own lunch and eat it while gazing at the glacier . <h> Where to stay : - <p> We stayed at the Del Glaciar Libertador Hostel &amp; Suites for which we found a special deal on Booking.com ( US$60 for a double room with private bathroom incl. breakfast , 20 % cheaper than stated on the hostel website ) . 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Carolyn , that 's a good point = I will have to take a new picture of her at some point = And were trying to do more video but are both still a bit camera-shy .

Cinaralti is located right on the waterfront and offers unforgettable views of the old city . <p> Istanbul , in Cengelk+y , by Marco De Niet on Flickr.com <p> - 2 Rustem Pasha Mosque <p> Even though Rustem Pasha Mosque is located right near the popular Spice Market by the Grand Bazaar , barely any foreign tourist visits the beautiful mosque which is known for being decorated with Iznik tiles . Built in 1563 by Ottoman architect Sinan , this is one of Istanbul 's best kept secrets , which can easily be added to your itinerary since you 'll most likely visit the Grand Bazaar and the Spice Market anyway . <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book market , Sahaflar Carsisi , - still has the old-fashioned atmosphere that the Grand Bazaar had before it got overrun by cruise tourists on a regular basis . You 'll find it between Grand Bazaar and Bayezid Mosque .

Every Sunday , hundreds of thousands of locals and tourists head to La Defensa avenue , where nearly 300 market stalls stretch over several blocks in the neighborhood.Founded in 1971 , it was originally known as the San Telmo Antiques Fair . There are still pockets of fascinating antiques to be seen , but the market has since developed into much more than that , with stalls that offer tourist trinkets , - jewelry , wool scarves from Patagonia , handmade dolls , street musicians and performers , food and tango.The oldest neighborhood in Buenos Aires , San Telmo still has cobble-stone streets and beautiful colonial buildings . Some buildings are well-preserved , while others are crumbling , but they all add to the character of this part of Buenos Aires . Even if you do n't  visit the neighborhood when the market is up and running , San Telmo is a great area to visit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee in one of the bars and cafes that transport you back to the turn of the 20th century.Plaza Dorrego is a little square where tango shows are performed on market days .

@@107142847 @2542847/ <h> Eating our way through Central America <p> Travel can be about discovering new place and meeting new people , but one of the most exciting aspects of travel is the food ! Every time we cross a border , we look forward to sampling new street food , discovering new fruits or vegetables , or trying out a local specialty . As vegetarians traveling through Central America , there werent many non-meat specialties , but we never had any trouble finding plenty of delicious food to eat ! Sure , we had many , many plates of rice &amp; beans and way too many eggs as we made our way from Mexico to Panama , but we managed to find a favorite dish in every country . <p> Here are some of our favorite dishes as we ate our way through Central America : <p> When we arrived in Guatemala , we still missed Mexican street food ( a lot ! ) and so we were happy when we found a street food stall in Antigua that sold flautas but wait , here they were called tacos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a tough call between the tacos and the tostadas for our Guatemalan street food . <p> It was in Guatemala where we started to have the typical breakfast consisting of black beans , eggs , rice and tortillas a breakfast we would have dozens of times during the next few months ( who 's complaining ! ) . <p> In El Salvador , we fell in love with pupusas . Thick corn tortillas are stuffed with cheese , refried beans or both ( or meat ) and served with a vinegar-cabbage salad and a hot salsa . We ate pupusas every day and had at least one at almost every meal . No matter if we had them at a street food stall , in a restaurant or a special pupuseria , they were always delicious ( except for that one time on the bus in the 102 degree heat ) . Pupusas cost $0.20 to $0.40 a piece , making them a ridiculously cheap meal . <p> Honduran food did not impress Jess , but I went crazy for Baleadas , which are large thin flour tortillas filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a breakfast burrito , but folded instead of rolled . <p> Nicaragua had some of the best food of our trip so far , even though the dishes did not vary too much . We just loved the fresh fruits ! We had a pineapple a day between the two of us , loads of watermelon , papaya ( which even Jess , usually a papaya hater , thought tasted good ) and zapote , a bright red fruit with a fuzzy brown outside similar to a kiwi . We loved the Nicaraguan beer and we devoured every single breakfast we had in Nicaragua , which remained the basic eggs , toast , rice and beans , but now instead of regular rice and beans , we were eating Gallo Pinto , which is rice &amp; beans in a special sauce mix . <p> While we stayed in Leon , we went to the market every day and bought fresh fruits and vegetables . <p> The vegetarian lunch plates were usually big enough for the two of us to share : <p> Dinner meant usually more rice &amp; beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your choice . <p> The vegetarian sandwiches , stacked with vegetables and a chayote patty , and served with fried plantains AND plantain chips , were also very tasty . <p> We bought Bunuelos , little cheesy dough balls served with a watery honey syrup on the streets of Granada : <p> But seriously , the best food we had in Nicaragua were the amazing breakfasts : <p> Gallo Pinto with fried eggs and a SPICY sauce which will wake you up for sure ! <p> Our love affair with Gallo Pinto did n't  need to end in Nicaragua , as it is practically the national dish of neighboring Costa Rica , although the best vegetarian food in Costa Rica are the casados , big plates filled with rice , pasta , black beans , steamed or grilled vegetables and a salad . Sometimes they also have plantains or cheese , and they are always under $5 for a super filling dinner . <p> You can order a casado with pretty much any kind of meat , but for us the casados vegetarianos were perfect , and not once did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cuisine in some of the nicer restaurants . We had a good splurge and ordered these fabulous yucca fries and cheese-filled yucca balls totally worth it ! <p> Panama does not cater to vegetarians the way the other Central American countries do , and while the food is very meaty , you also do not find a lot with tortillas . This means all the tortilla foods tacos , flautas , baleadas , tostadas , are no longer available as street food . Of course veggies can still get heaping plates of potato salad , rice &amp; beans and plantains for around $2 to $3 , and fruit is easy to find and fill up on . <p> In Panama , we felt the proximity to South America in the cuisine , one example being that there were empanadas everywhere , and because of the excellent variety , it was here in Panama that we were finally able to choose from loads of veggie options cheese , egg and potato and ( this is genius ) empanadas filled with Gallo Pinto ( we gobbled those up too fast for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Every Central American country ( and Mexico ) offers up incredibly delicious , freezing cold and surprisingly large licuados fresh fruit juices , like smoothies , but prepared either with water or milk . You can usually get your licuado with any one tropical fruit or all mixed together . To die for ! <p> Fruit made up a significant part of our diet , as the plastic bags or cups of fruit are faster , cheaper and healthier than any other fast food . For less than $1 you get a big cup filled with pineapple , watermelon or papaya . We found this mouth-watering strawberry-banana mix , topped with cream , in Todos Santos , Guatemala , for 5 Quetzales , or $0.60 . <p> Are you as hungry as we are now ? ! <p> If you 've traveled through Central America , we 'd love to know your favorite foods ! If you 've traveled to South America , do you have any suggestions for us for when we finally get there ? <h> 14 Comments <p> Glad you like the title we honestly felt that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just walk down the street grabbing food the entire time were out discovering a placeits just so fun ! <p> Hi Megan , no yeah , Guatemala does not have great food compared to other countries . You know I spent two years there , and honestly I preferred eating at Travel Menu or Roccio or Rainbow Cafe or Bagel Barn or cheese sandwiches from Epicure over the street food , but we did love the street food outside La Merced . The flautas , pupusas , tostadas were all really good there , and Dani also loved the Bunuelos there as much as the ones in Nicaragua . <p> Oh cool ! Yeah , we did n't  sample the amazing seafood in some places or the typical dishes which always have meat , but we were so satisfied with the loads of other foods , it was actually easy to be a vegetarian in Central America . <p> Wow , you girls really know how to do food porn photos !

@@107142848 @2542848/ <h> Life on the water : A floating village on Lake Tonle Sap in Cambodia <p> The floating markets of Bangkok with their colorful produce on adorable wooden boats floating through the citys canals , majorly impressed us . When I heard about entire floating villages in Cambodia , I knew we had to take a trip out to see it for ourselves . I mean , what can an entire floating village even look like , how does it even work ? All I honestly expected was a gathering of scattered houses on stilts along the lake shore , close to water but on solid ground . <p> What we found instead was a thriving community on Lake Tonle Sap , a lake big enough to be mistaken for the ocean . It took a 20 minute boat ride sloshing through a small tributary to reach the village . During the rainy season , the trip can take twice the time for the villagers to reach the dry land at the dock . <h> The incredible Lake Tonle Sap <p> Most of Cambodia 's floating villages are based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshwater lake in South East Asia , this unique body of water changes drastically in size- throughout- the year . In the rainy season between June and October , the lake is massive , flooded with water from the Mekong River . In the dry season , from November to May , the lake shrinks to such a degree that its flow reverses to deposit water back into the Mekong . <p> Tonle Sap is 16,000 square kilometers and nine meters deep during rainy season . In the dry season , that shrinks to 2,700 sq km and between 1 2 meters deep.Because the water levels differ so drastically in dry and rainy season , fishing families who make their living on the lake began living in floating villages which move with the changing water levels . <p> In the rainy season , this whole area is underwater . During dry season , these villagers live close to the shore . <p> Tonle Sap is one of the world 's biggest inland fisheries , producing over 400,000 tons of fish and feeding over 3 million people . There are over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the water <p> Providing over 3 million people with fresh fish means that fishermen are always in need . In total , 80,000 people live on the water permanently , spread out over 170 floating villages . Unlike much of the Cambodian job opportunities , the income is also reliable , but- life on the water is difficult . Fishermen sometimes travel two days to reach the middle of the lake and spend up to a week at a time out fishing . Large waves , limited food and dangerous conditions take their toll . The life expectancy of a fisherman is 54 years . <p> Unfortunately it is fairly common for fishermen not to return from their week-long trips . Many of the floating villages have their own floating orphanages to handle the many children whose parents do not survive.Life is hard on children , too . 12 per cent of the children die before the age of five due to the tough living conditions , the lack of medical care and ironically , malnourishment . Fish provides 65 per cent of protein in the Cambodian diet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is difficult to maintain a healthy diet . The annual income of households on the lake is under $500 . The community we visited , Chong Khneas , was just about to open its first floating hospital ( pictured below ) at the time of our visit . With seven villages and a total of 5,800 residents , this is one of the largest floating communities , so it makes sense that Chong Khneas be home to the first hospital.Life in a floating village means that every errand must be run by boat . Dropping the kids off at school or heading off to play basketball with their buddies must be done by paddling over by boat . And yes , there is a massive floating basketball court in the neighborhood ! Most of the residents are self-sufficient , and it is incredible how they maintain their homes , with floating vegetable gardens and floating barns where they keep goats , pigs and chickens.And like everywhere in Cambodia , there are dogs out here on the water as well , though I am not sure how they feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roam . At least it is much easier to find them if they runor swimaway ! There are also gas stations in the floating villages . Chong Khneas has three in fact , plus five schools , seven fish wholesalers , and for everyone 's entertainment : four karaoke bars . You might remember that karaoke is very popular in Cambodia.There are several floating supermarkets , but also floating markets like we had seen in Thailand : boats filled with fresh produce , and women paddling from house to house selling fruit and vegetables , wood and other things.We are- not sure how the villagers manage to dry their clothes in Cambodias already humid climate , but somehow it seems to work.Little space for all your possessionsFishermen arrive at the closest fish market to sell their catch of the day.Repair work is also done on the water Happy faces The kids are still enjoying themselves , but we could n't help but wonder how long they will stay that way , before following in their fathers footsteps . <p> This is really fascinating to read . We visited a floating village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super touristy and we werent able to get any useful information from our tour guide . It looks like your experience was much more positive ! <p> Really interesting to read all the facts from the village . I took a boat through the lake on my way to Battambang but we did n't  stop at any of the villages except for one well past the lake and on the side of the river ( just to pick up some lunch ) . It was fascinating to pass through and the Tonle Sap lake was incredible . <p> Thanks for this powerful and informative postI know most of the touristy floating villages seem somewhat idyllic to foreigners passing thru . Myself , I have n't visited any yet , but it definitely seems like quite an experience . <p> I love the photo of the fisherman submerged in the water with a cigarette in his mouth . Pictures of locals have been some of my favourite pictures Ive taken so far ! <p> Thanks , Laura ! Well that place did n't  seem idyllic at all it seemed like a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch with them . But I guess the ones that tourists can visit are better maintained than the villages further off the tourist path . It was one of the most interesting trips that we 've taken . <p> This is a really interesting read . Its crazy that people live their whole lives in a more or less self-contained floating village . I would feel so claustrophobic . However , I love that they have four karaoke bars ! Its all about getting your priorities right ! <p> Thanks Arianwen . Isnt it crazy to know that people live like this ? I would be claustrophobic too , but I guess if you grow up that way you do n't  know anything but that way of life . For them it must be shocking to go to a big city like Phnom Penh for the first time ! <p> I think , its not expected for human life . Really its very harmful in my realization . Something need to do for them very soon . Its very sad to me for their floating life . Think it , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a fascinating life ! Its definitely not an easy one but very different than anything most of us are used to . Orphanages , basketball courts , a lake that varies so much in size throughout the year a very interesting story about life . I hope its one that the enjoy . As a kid , I am not sure I would like it as I would want room to run about and play . <p> I love the floating villages of Cambodia . When I visited them the water levels seemed much lower than on your photos , so most houses were really high above us on their stilts . They even had a floating temple and police station . Fascinating lifestyle . <p> Thanks Tammy ! I think most of the houses in Chong Khneas were actually floating on big round aluminum jars , and they were pulled by boats further into the middle of the lake when the water levels sank . We only saw a few on stilts closer to the shore , but that 's how I thought all of them were ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those people are able to do that , I do n't  even have a clue because I do n't  think I can ever do that . Me &amp; water , we just happen not to be very good friends . <p> Wow , that 's a great post . I had no idea that whole towns existed on lakes like this . Sounds like a tough life , particularly for the kids , but one that is certainly different to the norm ! Great photos too = <p> Great photo essay , ladies especially love that blue house ! We visited a floating village very much like this on the Peruvian Amazon , but it did n't  look quite this nice . Like you said , it was amazing to see people with gardens , chickens , even livestock floating in the middle of the river , with people bathing , shopping , etc. on it and in it . Such an eye-opening view of a very different way of life . <p> Its so interesting to read some of the statistics about a place like this . When I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water . It seems it can actually be quite a hard and sad life for a lot of them . Thanks for sharing ! <p> Just wondering . I heard that there are some scamming schemes playing on tourists sympathy on the Tonle Sap area . That some poor-looking children are well-trained to beg tourists to buy them overly-priced things such as bags of rice from some stores , which theyll return to the stores again . There are a few other scenarios as well . I 'm not sure to what extent this is true , but have heard many negative travel experiences and is currently considering whether I should drop this from my travel plan to Cambodia . Just wondering if you encountered any such experience here , and if there any tips ? <p> Hi Andrew , we have n't actually come across anything like that while we were there . The experience was incredibly touristy though not sure if you 'll enjoy it . While we were annoyed by how overpriced the boat rides were and how little we actually got to see of the floating islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative and photos . Visited Tonle Sap on a trip through Battambang , the lake was beautiful on the day with amazing reflections . One could see that it must be a hard life and the people just manage to make a living . Pretty sad really . <p> Thanks so much ! Its such a hard life I recently visited a floating village in Thailand which reminded me of the villages in Tonle Sap and all I admired the sea gypsies who lived in the Thai floating village for staying afloat instead of simply moving to the mainland where theyd have a much easier life . <p> Bill surely into the water , yep . Considering that even a city like Venice still releases untreated sewage directly into the canals ( not all buildings have septic tanks ) its doubtful that a floating village in Cambodia will get a proper sewage system anytime soon . Which is why illnesses are widely spread and life expectation is low . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107142850 @2542850/ <h> Hong Kong On A Shoestring <p> You might remember that when I went to Hong Kong last year I was surprised to learn that the city is actually pretty expensive . I was on a budget , as usual , but I still wanted to splurge on a few of my favorite things : tasty coffee ( and yes , the $6 coffee at The Coffee Academics was worth every penny ! ) , fancy cocktails in rooftop bars with a view ( even though I skipped Ozone , the highest rooftop bar in the world , on top of the Ritz Carlton , and opted for a cheaper one ) , tasty pizza ( much needed after months of only Asian food , and Motorino , a famous Brooklyn pizza place , hit the spot ) , speakeasy bars and a nice place to stay.With all these things in mind , I tried to do everything else in Hong Kong as cheap as possible , and I think I succeeded . Transportation is very cheap , you can do a lot of sightseeing for free , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy eateries ( but then there 's still Tim Ho Wan , where you can sample Michelin star cuisine for around $10 ? ) . So here are my tips on how you can experience Hong Kong on a budget : <h> Get into Hong Kong on the cheap <p> You have a variety of options of getting from the airport into Hong Kong . The most expensive one ? Taking a cab , obviously . To get from the airport to Central Hong Kong will set you back at HKD250 " 350 ( US$32-45 ! ) . The airport express train ( which is much faster and more comfortable than a taxi , by the way ) is slightly cheaper at HK$90/US$11.61 to Kowloon ( HK$160/US$20.64 return ) and HK$100/ US$12.90 ( HK$180/US$23.22 return ) to Hong Kong Central.If you 're on a budget , you have two cheaper options : <p> Take a bus into Hong Kong . The buses to the airport leave from Kowloon and cost HKD39 ( US$5.02 ) . In Kowloon you can change to the subway , which is HKD5 to 15 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Alternatively , you can take the S1 bus to Tung Chung MTR station ( about 15 minutes from the airport , price : HKD3.50 / US$0.45 ) and change into the subway here " the Tung Chung line will bring you to Kowloon in about thirty minutes ( HKD18 / US$2.30 ) <h> Public transportation <p> Luckily , Hong Kong 's transportation network is excellent and there is absolutely no need to waste money on taxis . I navigated my way around the city with the help of GoogleMaps Public transport ' option which always showed me the correct buses or subways to use . The cheapest mode of transportation ? The tram , which covers parts of Hong Kong Island , and is only HKD2.30 ( US$0.30 ) . Like I mentioned above , subway tickets range from about HKD5 to 15 ( US$0.65 " $1.95 ) and buses are even a little bit cheaper . <p> The Star Ferry , the most scenic way to get from Kowloon to Central or vice versa , is ridiculously cheap : HK$2.50 " US$0.32 ! <p> Hong Kong has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London 's Oyster Card , which you credit with money for public transportation , but you can also pay with it in shops like 7-11 . You also top up your Octopus Card at a 7-11 stores , or at an MTR ( subway ) service center . Note that you pay a HK$50/US$6.45 deposit on the card " do n't forget to get it back before leaving Hong Kong . <h> Accommodation <p> Accommodation is without the doubt the most expensive aspect of a trip to Hong Kong . Hotels start at around $110 for a comfortable 3* hotel , and you can find good hotel deals for less than $200 . My tip : do your research beforehand and take advantage of- cheaper rates you can find some incredible- hotel deals by booking online.My first trip to Hong Kong was made pretty miserable by the poor accommodation choices I had made ( and by not booking anything in advance for the entire duration of my trip , leaving me with very few and very bad hotels to choose from when I had to move hotels ) . Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong which you can find on online discount websites . I stayed in Kowloon on my first visit , but enjoyed staying in Central more , which I did during my second visit . I also found the hotels to be nicer in Central . <p> If you 're on a very tight budget and plan on using hostels , expect to pay US$25 " 28 for a dorm bed or $60 for a private room in a hostel . <h> Sightseeing <p> I do n't think I paid anything for sightseeing in Hong Kong " just what it costs to get to a certain place , like the Giant Buddha or the Peak . But even the Peak is free if you , like me , want to combine sightseeing with a little workout and decide to walk up the mountain . It also saves you the HKD40 /US$5.05 for a return ticket for the Peak Tram . To get to the Big Buddha , take the subway to Tung Chung station . From here you can either take the scenic yet pricey cable car ( HKD125 round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HKD17.20 /US$2.22 ) . Or hike up the mountain its quite a strenuous hike , but its free =Other main attractions that are completely free ? The Avenue of the Stars , Hong Kong 's answer to LA 's Walk Of Fame , is free , as is the Symphony of Lights , the worlds Largest Permanent Light and Sound Show ' ( according to the Guinness Book Of World Records ) , which takes place every night at 8pm and is best seen from the Avenue of Stars . Strolling over the markets , such as the Ladies Market or Temple Street Market , is also free ( and great for cheap souvenir shopping ! ) , the beaches are free and only cost the ferry tickets to- get to them . Also : wandering the streets of Kowloon and Central is an excellent way to get to know Hong Kong , and it does n't  cost a penny . In Central you can also ride the worlds longest escalator for free and pop into the Chinese temples , which are all worth a visit.Two- pricey Hong Kong activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting the Sky100 observation deck ( cheapest ticket is HKD168 /US$21.65 ) , visit the sky lobby on the 46th floor of the Central Plaza skyscraper which can be visited for FREE ! Instead of taking the hop-on hop-off sightseeing bus ( tickets start at US$57 ) , take a much cheaper sightseeing tour on a local bus its much better for people watching , too , and itll only cost you a couple of bucks . CNN Travel listed the best bus routes to take in Hong Kong . 129336 @qwx989336 <p> I think three full days are a good amount of time to see quite a bit of Hong Kong , but four would be better ( if you want to make it up to the Big Buddha , for example ) . Its a giant city , along the lines of New York or Rome which you also ca n't really explore in a day or two , you need at least three nights to get an overview .

With all the tourist attractions checked off the list , this time I wanted to uncover spots that tourists , and even some locals , usually do n't visit . <p> But that does n't  mean you should n't and here 's why : each one of these stops offers a completely authentic view of New York City , whether its insight into the way the city really runs and what makes it tick or actually providing unique views of the Manhattan skyline . <p> The best part is that almost all of them are free ! Read on for my top five off-the-beaten-path spots in New York City : <h> 1 . Take the ferry to Governors Island <p> Governors Island is a small 172-acre ( 70- ha ) island , about half a mile from the southern tip of Manhattan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for centuries , and has only been open to the public since 2006 . Now , visitors can take the short ferry ride from Brooklyn or Manhattan during the summer months and enjoy an artificial beach , giant green spaces and a cycle path around the island when they feel they need to get away from Big City life . You can still see historic buildings there , like Castle Williams and Fort Jay , both built in the 18th century , or just enjoy the gorgeous views of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty . You can rent bikes there ( or bring your bike on the ferry ) , bring a picnic or enjoy a meal from the food trucks on the island , or explore the island on foot . Currently , only the northeastern half of the island is open to the public , but the southwestern half is being redeveloped and will be opened as a park and picnic area soon . Noteworthy events include Figment , an annual participatory art festival , photography exhibitions , the skate truck and several art fairs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Brooklyn 's Pier 6 and Manhattan 's Battery Maritime Building ( about every thirty minutes , see the full ferry schedule here ) . East River Ferries also docks at Governors Island , connecting it with Williamsburg and offering further stops ( Wall Street in Manhattan , DUMBO and Williamsburg in Brooklyn , and 34th Street in Manhattan ) " here , East River Ferry ticket prices apply ( $4 one-way , an additional $1 for bikes ) . <h> 2 . Get out to Red Hook <p> Red Hook in Brooklyn is one of the up-and-coming ' neighborhoods in the city , expected to grow in a way similar to trendy Williamsburg , which has become the area with the highest hipster population in New York . Red Hook is not quite there , but well on its way with independent stores , restaurants and art galleries arriving over the last few years and rejuvenating the formerly decaying waterfront community . Red Hook 's biggest challenge is its location " way out on a peninsula southwest of Carroll Gardens , bordering on the Hudson River . Strangely enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened there recently and bringing in an upswing of visitors with their free water taxi available from Manhattan each weekend . <p> While it was formerly a mainly industrial area , you 'll now find cute restaurants that take pride in using local ingredients , creative shops and galleries , a large community garden , seafood pubs and bars with views over the water , and more businesses opening on a monthly basis . There is even an artisan chocolate factory and a distillery where you can take free tours . The 20-minute ferry ride from Manhattan 's Pier 11 alone is worth the trip , offering the same spectacular views that the ferry to Governors Island has , but going way beyond that . There are several walkways along the waterfront , piers that are featuring art projects now , and at the Louis Valentino Jr park right at the Hudson River you can rent kayaks during the summer months or just enjoy the views of the Statue of Liberty across the bay . Most of the restaurants and shops are located on Van Brunt Street and the surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to get here is via the free IKEA ferry that runs for free on weekends ( every 20 minutes from 11am ) . There is an additional stop at Van Brunt Street so you can get out there instead of going all the way to IKEA and then walk back . The ferry also runs on weekdays , but charges $5 one way . The closest subway stops are Carroll Street or Smith-Ninth Street on the F and G train . The B61 bus goes all the way to Downtown Brooklyn and stops at the Smith-Ninth Street Subway Station . The B57 bus also goes to Downtown Brooklyn . <h> 3 . Discover the Elevated Acre <p> The Elevated Acre is , as the name indicates , an acre of green space on an elevated level between Lower Manhattan 's massive skyscrapers . We were surprised to find out how few New Yorkers actually knew about this space , even though it is just around the corner from Pier 11 and from Wall Street . Tourists have n't found out about this lovely spot either , even though hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this rooftop park . <p> While it is packed with office workers during the weekday lunch hours , this is a great little hidden spot with superb views over the East River , the Brooklyn Bridge and Governors Island . Get here early , bring a book and a coffee and while away for an hour or so . The Elevated Acre also has a seven-tiered amphitheater and movies are shown here at night during the summer . <h> 4 . Take the aerial tramway to Roosevelt Island <p> Roosevelt Island is another little island in the East River that is worth a visit . Tucked in between Manhattan 's Upper East Side and Queens , this long , but narrow island stretches over two miles ( 3- km ) from Manhattans East 46th to East 85th Streets , but only has a maximum width of 800 feet ( 240- m ) . Even though the island itself does n't have much on it other than residential apartment blocks , there is a lovely waterfront park on the island 's south side , Southpoint Park , that makes for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset from . You can also walk up to the Northpoint Lighthouse , which dates back to 1872 . The views over Manhattan 's East Side are lovely , and the best way to see them is actually from the areal Roosevelt Island Tramway ( which you might recognize from the last Spiderman movie ) , the best way to arrive on the island . Plan an hour or two to walk around the park or bring a picnic for a relaxed afternoon . <p> How to get here : The most scenic way to arrive is via the Roosevelt Island Tramway which leaves from 2nd Avenue between 59th and 60th Street and takes you high up above the roofs of Manhattan . You can use the tramway with your MTA metro pass . Make sure to get a spot near the front window and do n't  worry about all the locals on there rolling their eyes as you vie for the best spot to take pictures . They could have easily taken the F Train , which also stops on Roosevelt Island , so they 're doing this for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 5 Pointz ) <p> 5 Pointz and MoMa PS1 are not to be missed by art and street art fans alike . Located on Long Island City just across the street from each other , both locations can be visited in a couple of hours . MoMa PS1 belong 's to the MoMa ( Museum of Modern Art ) , but focuses on cooler , edgier exhibitions . It 's located in a former school and the exhibits you find here are more cutting-edge and thought-provoking than the pieces that you find at its famous sister in Manhattan . There is also an ever-changing architectural garden . If you want to party like a New Yorker , check out the free weekly dance parties during the summer months . <h> *UPDATE MAY 2014* <p> I just returned from a visit to 5Pointz , where I wanted to check out the latest pieces on the warehouse . I was shocked to find the warehouse painted over with white paint , with all the graffiti gone . Apparently , the warehouse will be torn down and be replaced with a condo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did , I think it would have been better to leave the graffiti on there until the building is torn down . A shame that this street art mecca is gone now . <p> 5 Pointz , right across the street from MoMa PS1 , has traditionally been considered New York 's street art mecca , a former warehouse transformed into a huge canvas that attracts street artists from around the world . Have a look around and inside the building to see some fantastic graffiti pieces . <p> MoMa PS1 is of course still well worth a visit ! <p> How to get there : MoMA PS1 is located on 22-25 Jackson Ave ; 5 Pointz sits between Davis and Crane Streets . MoMa PS1 is open Thursday through Monday from 12pm to 6pm , closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays . Suggested admission is $10 , or $5 for students . The closest subway stations are Long Island City Court Square ( G ) or 21st St ( G ) , 45 Rd Court House Square ( 7 ) , 23rd St Ely Ave ( E , M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the street , is also worth a visit , as is Ms Wells Dinette , which belongs to the MoMa PS1 and pays homage to the buildings former identity as a schoolhouse with communal tables and a perpetually changing menu . <p> Still looking for a hotel in New York City but not sure where to stay ?

The World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarapiqui and Reventazon River are the biggest white water rafting destination , but with countless other rivers in the country , there are many possibilities for rafting in places like Arenal , Jaco and San Jose . And not only the rapids are spectacular , but also the beautiful tropical scenery you pass on the river : Depending on which river you 're rafting on , you 'll see mountains , wildlife , rainforests , pineapple and yucca fields " and no matter where you 'll raft , it will be an unforgettable experience with splashing waves , wild rapids and a great thrill . A trip on the longest river in the country , the Pacuare , can take up to two days , but shorter 10 mile trips are also possible , for example on the Sarapiqui River near Arenal . <p> Rafting in Costa Rica by Tshantz on Flickr.com <h> Hiking an active volcano <p> Costa Rica is known for its large number of volcanoes : the tiny country is home to 61 dormant and extinct volcanoes and six active ones . The most active one over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been resting since 2010 . Most of Costa Rica 's volcanoes are caldera volcanoes , which means the craters are filled with bright green or turquoise waters rising steam , which makes for a breathtaking sight and makes volcano climbing so popular here . The best ones to climb are : <p> Iraz+ with its majestic 11,000 feet ( 3,800 meter ) summit , from where you can see both the Pacific and the Caribbean on clear days , and its emerald-green crater lake . The lake can transform color , and sometimes it appears crimson-red ! <p> Po+s crater by Carlos Reusser Monsalvez on Flickr.com <p> Po+s , which has been pretty active in recent years , even causing the national park in the Central Highlands to close temporarily , and which has a fantastic lookout point above the crater with its bubbling sulfuric pool , which is 1 miles wide and 1,000 feet ( 300 meters ) deep , making it one of the largest volcano craters in the world . At 8,885 feet ( 2,708 meters ) , Po+s is one of the country 's largest volcanoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can zipline in several places around the country , but my personal favorite ziplining spot is Monteverde with its lush green cloud forests . Nestled high in the mountains , Monteverde 's climate is a bit cooler than the rest of the country , but also causes a much more diverse flora and fauna and animal life , especially bird life . There are several ziplining companies here , but the Selvatura Adventure Park offers the most comprehensive canopy tour , including tree-top walkways , hanging bridges , a breathtaking one-kilometer long zipline and a heart-stopping Tarzan Swing . The park 's walkways and platforms are built right into the cloud forest , and you can zip through the cloud forest on 15 cables , enjoying the nature around you from a variety of different angles and vantage points . <p> Monteverde Zipline Tour by Ben Belske on Flickr.com <h> Surfing in Nosara <p> The tiny surf town of Nosara on Costa Rica 's Atlantic coast is , despite its small size , one of the most popular surf spots in the entire world . The surf break here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surf beach with its 4 miles stretch of sand , is filled with surfers year-round . The long breaks here make it a great spot for both experienced surfers and beginners . The more daring surfers enjoy the more remote Playa Nosara , a black sand beach just north of town , with giant barrels created by shallow reef breaks . For newbie surfers , there are a number of surf schools in town , and the small number of tourists here create a much bigger relaxed community feel than some of the bigger surf towns in the country . The beaches are beautiful , and it 's one of the places in Costa Rica where the beach meets the jungle , meaning that you 'll see monkeys jumping through the trees on a regular basis but might also see sloths and other mammals . <h> An ATV tour in Guanacaste <p> ATVing is highly popular in Costa Rica , with many locals cruising around on these little four-wheelers , and they are simply the best way to explore beaches , mountains , rain forests and other off-road terrain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an ATV is Guanacaste , where you find several ATV tours , for example in Jaco . They usually include ocean view points over the Pacific , colorful little villages , rain forests with a myriad of wildlife , waterfalls and watermelon plantations , all while whizzing around on the ATV , combining the thrill of the off-roading with a scenic tour of the country . <h> 5 Comments <p> I agree that Costa Rica is an amazing destination that should n't be skipped . I know it gets a bad rap for being too expensive and too touristy , but there are ways to work around those things and it truly is a beautiful country . The ziplining in Monteverde was one of my favorite activities in Costa Rica . You really cant ask for more beautiful scenery = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107142860 @2542860/ <h> Why Porte+os escape to Rosario , Argentina ( and why you should , too ! ) <p> With Buenos Aires , Patagonia and all that wine country , we understand that Rosario can be easily overlooked on a trip to Argentina . That 's why all the Porte+os ( locals in Buenos Aires ) escape here during major holidays . <p> To them , Rosario is a quaint ' city of just over 1 million inhabitants . Here they can shop in stores that are n't crowded , sip coffee in quiet cafes and stroll for miles and miles along the Paran+ river in peace . <p> Rosario is the kind of city we absolutely love . It 's not a showcase city like Buenos Aires or the seat of government . But as the birthplace of the national flag and Che Guevara , Rosario sure ai n't quaint , either . <p> Unlike his image plastered across T-shirts and magnets throughout the rest of the world , we could n't believe how absent Che Guevara 's image is in Argentina . Even here in his birthplace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born , on the street Entre Rios 480 , which is still a private residence marked only by sign out front . ( The Guevara family home in Cordoba where they moved shortly after his birth is now a museum . ) <p> Snooping around a bit , we did find a large mural of him in a nearby plaza and local friends showed us a statue made of melted keys much further outside the city center . <p> Pride in the national flag ? Now that 's another story . The massive , 78m high monolithic monument to the flag , aptly called the Monumento Nacional a la Bandera , is just off the waterfront and practically impossible to miss . An eternal flame burns in the center , and Manuel Belgrano , designer of the Argentine flag , rests in a crypt below . <p> And LGBT pride is front and center here , too , we discovered , when we spotted a monument to sexual freedom one day while walking the river promenade . The first country in South America to legalize same sex marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relates to the LGBT community . Much of that progress came as a result of former Rosario congresswoman Silvia Augsburger , who has led the charge not only for marriage equality and women 's rights , but also wrote the transgender rights bill in 2007 that was finally passed in 2011 , which covers gender reassignment surgery under national insurance . <p> Despite its openness , Rosario is n't a particularly alternative city . In fact , there are still meat and potatoes experiences to be had " literally . We spent Friday evening at a barbecue down at the Paran+ River , where for a few pesos , locals can set up and grill their steaks and sausages late into the night all along the water . However , - Rosario can definitely feel young , with loads of bars and restaurants along Avenue Pellegrini , plus student bars and lots of street art throughout town . <p> Down in the Del Abasto neighborhood , we visited the Bellas Artes museum , which is an easy half an hour visit unless you are very into history , but stop there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a busy , fun park with families eating ice cream , friends out on paddle boats , popcorn and those typical Latino clown comedy acts.From there , we walked down Boulevard Oro+o , a grand , tree-lined boulevard with a tiled middle strip with benches and plenty of space for people to cycle , rollerblade and walk down to the riverfront . A good half hour walk , it brings you right to the MACRO Contemporary Art Museum , instantly recognizable by the brightly painted grain silos right on the- Paran+ waterfront . MACRO houses work by young local artists in small galleries spread over eight floors , plus there is a good view of the river islands from the mirador ( viewpoint ) at the top . <p> We did n't make it out to the islands , but Isla Invernada Boats stop at several river beaches , called balnearios , leaving from the western shore of Invernada island . They are your typical summery islands , with ice-cream stands , music , boats , and beaches with umbrellas . <p> But if you 're really looking for beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five km north of downtown . This stretch , along with the islands , are the best places to swim , and have sandy beaches , cafes , bars and volleyball nets . <p> The wide tree-lined avenues , busy downtown bars and restaurants , gorgeous ornate architecture and beaches along the river give Rosario a sense of grandeur very reminiscent of Buenos Aires , with a sense of peace and quiet absent in the capital . <h> Rosario Travel Information : <p> Rosario is located about 185 miles ( 299km ) north east of Buenos Aires . Buses run several times a day from Buenos Aires , Salta , Cordoba and all other major cities to Rosario it takes about 4 hours to get here from the capital . <p> There are plenty of hostels in town , but wed advice to book well in advance , especially during Argentine holidays when the Porte+os flock here . <p> Three days are enough to get a good feel for the city and to see the main sights , but you can easily spend a week here , eating your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beaches , explore the nightlife and the islands along the river . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 17 Comments <p> I made the same experience in consideration of the whole Che Guevara hype in the rest of the world . My host family back in Argentina just did n't  believe me when I told them that he is famous in Germany and they sell shirts and posters with him on it . <p> Right ? ! Even in Thailand or other far flung places you 'll see Che on something , at least a T-Shirt . He represents this type of freedom , rebel thing that travelers everywhere seem to identify with , even if that wasnt exactly what he was going for back then originally . And then you get to Argentina its as if he s not from there at all ! <p> Ugh , yes of course I meant South Americasomehow in the world just flowed out and neither of us saw it or changed it . Thanks as always for pointing that stuff out = We loved Rosario , and you could rent an apartment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure . <p> That really surprises me that they do n't  celebrate Che in his birth place . But I guess it is how he would have wanted it . I am sure he would feel quite uncomfortable knowing the hype that is made about him all over the world . <p> Sorry to bother Manuel Belgrano was actually burried in Buenos Aires . Below the so called National Flag Memorial there 's only the " Honour hall to the flags of America " . About Che Guevara Its kind of a complicated story you know ? We 've had lots of political violence here through the 60s and 70s , stretching from far right to far left and first , the leftist were murdered , then the rightists were condemned and went to prison and finally I guess were on the process of morally condemning violence as a hole . <p> I was born in Rosario , but I am living in Buenos Aires . All you write is quite true , Concerning Che Guevara , I think we are tired of him , that 's all . Thanks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is true . <p> Great post about Rosario , the hometown of Messi nowadays I-m afraid Che Guevara left Argentina when he was an unknown university dropout and made his whole life and exploits in Cuba ( where locals nicknmaed him che as Argentinians are often called in Latinamerica after the funny meaningless word they use to adress each other ) Argentinians identify him with the International history of Communism ( as does the rest of the world ) and sense no particular relationship to him ( learning only late in life that he was an Argentinian- his name being absent from schoolbooks , streets , plazas , etc ) associated as he is with such an unrelated foreing topic ( more aking to Indonesia or Angola ) such a Third World peasant revolt ) As for portenos heading to Rosario , it is true they find it more relaxing whenever they ever visit ( which is only if they have some relatives , or business ) the favorite porteno destinations for the holidays are the classic three ( by volume of visitors ) : sea , hills or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cordoba , Bariloche ( and all the tourist towns surrounding them ) <p> That is to say Rosario is too much like B.A. ( only smaller and therefore perceived by portenos as a B.A. wannabe ) being part of the same flat humid Pampa region and and just another extension of B.A. ( as are the other small cities in the humid pampas ) minus the gaucho folk-lore it offers therefore nothing different from B.A. ( Rosarinos do n't  even have a distinct accent or local culture or food such as Cordobeses , Correntinos , Saltenos ) and therefore the massive preference for the sand and beaches of the Atlantic , the sundrenched hills ( sierras ) of Cordoba with their wonderful Mediterrenean landscape , weather and sunshine ( did I mention that ? ) or the virgin pine-forests , lakes and snowy mountains of Bariloche .. <p> As for the streets and statues that ARE named after Che-Guevara / none pre-date the 90s when foreign tourism took off in Argentina ( and globalization and CNN made Argentinians aware of the link ) . The emphasis of the current administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anti-Americanist discourse of CFK , Chavez , Evo ) also helped <p> Sorry Lim+n , but where are you from ? We do have some differents foods from bsas , for example The Sandwich called " Carlitos " you can only eat it in Rosario , same thing happens with the river fish , were used to eat fresh because were really close to it . About the accent ? Of course we do ! It " s not so different like Salta o Cordoba , but if you compare it to a porte+o accent , you should notice it ( we do n't  use the S at the end of words , and porte+os put it in words that does n't  go with S ) yes , we do n't  have the cold sea that the porte+os have to a shorter distance , but we have " el Paran+ " a brown river where we all in the summer to the beach , to chill and to practise sports all year !

@@107142862 @2542862/ <h> Hiking Italy 's Cinque Terre : A spectacular day trek <p> Undoubtedly one of Italys most scenic regions , the five villages of Cinque Terre Riomaggiore , Manarola , Corniglia , Vernazza and Monterosso " are tucked into a steep mountainside , some built into the walls of towering cliffs , others open to tiny fishermans ports at sea level . Word has long since gotten out about these five beautiful lands ( in Italian , cinque means five and terre means lands ) , and during the early morning in Monterosso , the first of the five towns , tourists tend to come in waves first the early birds , then a few tour groups arriving from their cruise ships and by 10am , the villages are temporarily populated with people from around the world . Luckily we discovered one way to escape the masses and have Cinque Terre at least partially to ourselves by hiking between the villages . <p> Cinque Terre forms a ten kilometer stretch of land along the Lingurian coast in an isolated spot between steep cliffs and the Mediterranean Sea . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only from the outside world , but also from each other . As agriculture in the area developed , trade between the five lands increased , with farmers traversing narrow dirt paths along the mountainside between the towns . <p> Today , there are still no roads , but an efficient train system transports passengers between the towns . The best way to escape the crowds , however , is by hiking the arduous dirt trail which connects the villages . <h> Through vertical vineyards <p> After squeezing through two particularly large tour groups in Monterosso ( most likely fresh off their cruise ship landed in nearby La Spezia ) we head up the set of stone stairs that would bring us to the trail head . The din of chatter from the crowds below quickly disappears during our 250 step ascent , and for the first twenty minutes along the path , we are left entirely alone to climb our way through nearly vertical vineyards and olive orchards . <p> Sweaty and panting for breath , we reach the top of this part of the trail between Monterroso and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread out below . A couple with a toddler and a small group pass by as we catch our breath and enjoy the views before continuing along the trail . We wind through endless shades of green , stepping over vines and tree branches , followed by the flutter of birds . The sun had been burning down on us without remorse ; we quickly forget this as the village of Vernazza comes into view , down at the bottom of the mountain . <h> Arrival in the village <p> The path is uneven and unforgiving and at times so close to the edge that we are thankful for our travel insurance . We attempt to descend slowly , but we are crispy from the sun and very thirsty , and the sights of the beach cove below make us go faster and faster down the hill . After an exhausting 90-minute hike , we enter Vernazza through slim alleyways which barely fit two people shoulder to shoulder , passing through cool stone buildings where local residents go about their daily business " washing clothes , making lunch , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lanes we enter the main plaza by the harbor , and we are immediately surrounded by the sort of masses of people you might expect at a festival or an annual town fair , and this happens seven days a week . It is no surprise that , though not unfriendly , residents make themselves scarce during the day. - We grab a slice of pizza , a big bottle of water and slump down onto a central set of stairs perfect for people-watching . <p> Batteries recharged and bellies full , we set off to the next village of Corniglia , knowing that the most difficult part of the trail ( between Monterosso and Vernazza ) is behind us . <h> Perched on the mountain top <p> This next stretch also takes about 90 minutes and while there are very few places in the shade and the path very uneven , the views more than make up for the heat and the steep passages . We pass through more vineyards and flower gardens before scaling the steps into the village . <p> Perched on top of a cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less packed than either Monterosso or Vernazza . There are less people here , and we spend time cooling off inside the church before strolling through the alleys toward a marvelous viewpoint jutting out from the end of a cliff . <p> We cant stay here long , and have to dart quickly down the steps to the train station . The path between Corniglia and Manarola , the next town , is closed . At various times throughout the year , stretches of the paths are impassable due to heavy rains or construction . In our case , there had been a landslide which covered the next part of the trail . Trains run frequently tough , connecting all five villages to the nearby city of La Spezia . <p> We hop aboard the packed overcrowded train and hop off in Manarola 3 minutes later , a feat that would have taken nearly 60 again by foot . Having arrived so quickly , our minds are still in the romantic fog of Corniglia , and stepping out into Manarola is a bit of a shock . We head down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafes , and pizza joints jam-packed with people . We grab another small slice of pizza . We feel we 've earned it , after over three hours of strenuous hiking . <h> The Path of Love <p> Very excited , if not a bit weary , we set off on this last stretch of the Cinque Terre trail connecting Manarola to Riomaggiore . At just over a kilometer , this hike is by far the shortest . It is completely paved and flat with safe , firm railings , making it by far the safest , too . This stretch of the path is known as the Via dellamore or the Path of Love , and is the one part of the path that almost all visitors to Cinque Terre choose to hike . <p> Here , couples walk hand in hand , and either scribble their names onto walls and benches or seal their love forever with a padlock , a long-standing tradition here . We make our own mark of love , too , before continuing on the last bit of the path . <h> Sunset in Cinque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain paths and through the villages and are relieved at the relaxed arrival in Riomaggiore . It is nearly 7pm now . The tourists have left , the last hikers are making their way to their cars , and the locals have now come out to enjoy their time with the town . Italian grandmas chat on benches while their husbands gather in doorways and smoke and laugh . <p> Shopkeepers are sweeping the front steps , while the soccer ball bounces back and forth along the cobblestone between the kids playing as the sun sets behind them . On our way out of town , we stop along the side of the winding road and watch the sun sink into the sea , the perfect , quiet end to the day . <h> The Cinque Terre Tail : The facts <p> A day ticket to enter the hiking trails within the Cinque Terre National Park is 5 Euros ( 9 Euros for 2 days , 12 Euros for a weekend ticket ) and includes free train transport between the five villages . <p> The complete 10k ( 6.5 mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in each village . <h> The Cinque Terre Trail : What to bring <p> Water " The hike is constant climbing and descent , the sun can be hot .

The views and all the villages offer countless photo ops . <p> Healthy snacks " There is plenty of scrumptious Italian food in each of the villages , but fruit or other healthy snacks are more difficult to come by . If you are looking for healthy options , consider stocking up before the hike . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> What a beautiful and special place .

@@107142865 @2542865/ <h> The Story Of The Yellow Envelope ( + Book Giveaway ! ) <p> I 've loved reading travel blogs ever since starting my own journey in 2010 , when I also started my own travel blog . Before that , I did n't  even know they existed . But when I started Globetrottergirls , I started reaching out to other bloggers , and other bloggers started reaching out to me . Back then , there werent that many , and there werent many that I really loved . I mainly followed people who were also traveling through South America , a few blogging couples and several solo female travelers . <p> Over the next couple of years , it seemed like the travel blogosphere exploded . All of a sudden , all these blogs appeared for a while , it seemed like every single day a new blog was launched ! The quality of these blogs , however , varied greatly . I found less and less that I enjoyed reading , but there were a few exceptions . <p> One of those was a blog called So Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her husband Brian selling everything they owned to travel the world . Her way of writing and sharing her rawest emotions made me feel as if I was right there with them part of their journey . <p> - Months later , the couple were finally on their one-way flight to South America , and I was following along as they made their way south towards Argentina . As they were getting closer to Argentina , where I was at the time , I really wanted to meet them and we made plans to meet up once they 'd get to Buenos Aires . We had been in touch through email and I was excited to hear how their journey had been so far " a journey Kim had dreamed up and prepared for years . <p> It was when we met up in Buenos Aires that Kim told me the story of The Yellow Envelope , an envelope filled with money which was given to her and Brian as a farewell gift by their friends Michele and Glenn before they set off on their indefinite journey . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Fund ' . The couple were supposed to give the money away on their travels in whatever way they wanted " to people , kids , animals or the environment , either all at once or spread out along the way . With the envelope , the couple had been given three rules : 1 ) Do n't overthink it 2 ) Share your experiences 3 ) Do n't feel pressured to give it all away . <p> Oh my god , this makes such a great story for a book , I said . Kim , I really hope that a book will come out of this. <p> Fast forward four years and I found myself in Ecuador , where Kim and Brian started their journey back in 2012 . I am looking at the cover of The Yellow Envelope on my Kindle screen , about to start to read the book which had come out of Kim 's journey . <p> Kim had indeed made it happen not only had she written the book , but she also managed to get a book deal . And today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and A Life-Changing Journey Around the World is finally being launched and is available in book shops around the country ! <p> It was only fitting that I delved into the story in Ecuador , where their journey had begun . Having read so much of Kims writing over the years I had no doubt that I would enjoy the book , but only a few chapters in , I was surprised when I noticed that this book was so much more than the stories of how they spent the yellow envelope money along the way . <p> It is Kims personal story , her struggles of becoming the person she wanted to be , of her questioning her relationship , unsure if she wanted to be married anymore , her soul-searching . It 's a story about the roadblocks Kim and Brian had to overcome on their trip , not only on their physical journey , which turned out to be much more challenging than they had assumed , but also how both of them change and grow with every country they visit . <p> The Yellow Envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went , and some of the stories of how they spend the money as they traverse the globe are extremely touching . <p> I could n't put the book down . I was completely mesmerized by Kims deeply emotional and honest storytelling , beautifully capturing the journey within herself as well as the places they were visiting.I do n't  want to give away too much , but their trip takes them from South America to India , to Vietnam , Nepal , Mexico and Indonesia . Each country holds its very own set of challenges for them , each country has them meet someone who is in need of the money the Yellow Envelope holds . <p> If you love travel , are curious to read somebody else 's journey to self-discovery and the account of a venturesome backpacking trip around the world , with random acts of kindness sprinkled in , you will enjoy The Yellow Envelope as much as I did . <h> Giveaway ! <p> Since I loved this book so much , I want to gift one of you a copy .

I had heard great things about Monta+ita , a small village on the Santa Elena Peninsula on Ecuadors Pacific Coast . Monta+ita is the countrys number one surf spot , and , as I learned when I arrived there , a prime party destination for people from all over South America . Think South Americas answer to Ibiza , only with less mega clubs , but with loud music right on the beach instead , blasting from several discos right along the shore . <p> The problem with that ? I was just not in the mood for a mega party , and I had also been warned about walking around town at night by myself . A couple of backpacking girls from Argentina were brutally murdered in Monta+ita less than a year ago , and I did n't  get a good vibe from the village . The beach was okay , but nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a red flag on the beach every day , warning people that the surf was intense and the current was strong . <p> I ended up preferring the two beaches south and north of Monta+ita Olon to the north was much more charming , with seemingly nicer accommodation and cuter restaurants , plus several appealing beach bars and less tourists . Manglaralto to the south seemed like it lacked foreign tourists entirely or at least I never saw any when I ventured down there . <p> What all three villages have in common : the amazing sunset spectacle the sky put on for us every single night .

@@107142867 @2542867/ <h> Isla Mujeres : Finding Paradise in Mexico <p> The first mistake I made when I visited Isla Mujeres ? I only stayed for a day . That was in 2010 , during my first trip to the Yucatan peninsula , when I lived in Playa del Carmen for a month . I fell in love with the little island off the coast of Cancun immediately . <p> Can you see why ? The second mistake I made ? I waited nearly six years to return to Isla Mujeres , even though I was raving about it to everyone who was planning a trip to the Yucatan and asked me for advice on where to go , and despite the fact that I returned to the Yucatan in 2012 . It is still beyond me why I did n't plan in time for a little island getaway back then , but I guess after two months of living on a remote Caribbean beach- I was n't craving more beach time.When I planned my Yucatan road trip this year , I made sure that we would spend some time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , which is only 1.3 miles ( 7 kilometers ) long and 2,130- feet ( 650 meters ) wide . As I recall , there were n't even cars on the island then , only golf carts , but this time around there were a few cars as well . However , golf carts are still definitely outnumbering cars on Isla Mujeres , and most tourists rent those for the day instead of scooters.I later found out exactly how many vehicles there are on the island : about 130 taxis , 500 golf carts and 1,500 scooters.Even though we wanted to rent a golf cart to whiz around the island , that was n't our first priority . Our first priority was this:Playa Norte . This beach on the northern end of Isla Mujeres is one of the most beautiful beaches I 've ever been to , along with Koh Poda , my Thai paradise island , and Boracay , the paradise I found in the Philippines.It 's one of those beaches where you can just sit and look out at the ocean for hours , without the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams are made of ! I could 've spent my entire time at this beach , with the occasional swim in the ocean " the water here is so shallow that you can walk for about 160 feet ( 50 meters ) into the ocean and still be only knee deep in the water.But we were n't only here to relax on the beach ( even though this was our main reason to visit Isla Mujeres ) , we also wanted to see the rest of the island.We were staying on the far northern tip of Isla Mujeres , where the ferries from Cancun arrive and where you have the biggest congregation of restaurants and small hotels " none of the massive concrete blocks you can see in the far distance in Cancun ! " a small village if you want to call it that.The village ' does n't even have a name , it is simply known as El Centro ' , and Hidalgo Street is the main drag here with plenty of restaurants , souvenir shops and hotels . But all of the restaurants and cafes in neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Centro ' . The houses here are as colorful as one would expect from a Caribbean island , and there is even some street art ! Most of the murals have a deeper meaning : they were painted in 2014 during the Murals For Oceans street art festival in order to promote respect and protection for endangered whale sharks and manta rays , which migrate to Isla Mujeres every year to feast on plankton.We balked- at the costly price for a 24-hour golf cart rental ( $40 " I had paid $7 per day for a rental car in Cancun ! ) but sucked it up because I wanted to go to the southern part of the island , which is quite the opposite from the northern part with its long sandy stretch of beach and crystal clear water.Down there , you find cliffs that tower high above the ocean , which is a deep blue color here . It is a spectacular sight and reminds me of the coast of Ireland " the lush green on top of the cliffs , and the roaring ocean below.On the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the origin of the name of the island : Isla Mujeres means Island of Women . <p> The Mayans had a presence on the island and during that time , it was sacred to Ix Chel , the Maya goddess of childbirth and medicine . When the Spanish arrived here in the 16th century and saw all the images of Ix Chel , they named it Island of Women . And on the southern end of the island , you find a statue depicting Ix Chel . <p> There is also a little sculpture park there , which was free to visit the first time I was on the island , but this time around , they were charging 30 Pesos per person , so we skipped it and cruised around in our golf cart some more , stopping at a little marina with a hotel restaurant for a snack . <p> We decided to stop in a little marina along the way for some snacks in a hotel with a restaurant right by the ocean I had been hoping to find a beach club I had randomly found on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't remember where it was.After a long day of sightseeing we returned to Playa Norte in time to watch the spectacular sunset " there is no better place on the island to watch the sunset from ! The sunsets on the island alone are worth an overnight trip , but most people seem to come to Isla Mujeres on a day trip from Cancun , which includes a short stop on the island and several snorkeling stops.I would , however , recommend to spend at least one night here . If you are looking for a Caribbean experience that is n't pricey ( prices in Cancun are en par with US prices for drinks , dinner and entertainment these days ! ) and easy to get to , Isla Mujeres is the place for you.I hope that it wo n't take me six more years to return to Isla Mujeres , my Mexican paradise <h> How to visit Isla Mujeres <p> From Cancun , it is super easy to get to Isla Mujeres . I recommend spending a night or two on the island ( if not longer ) instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cab straight from the airport , and if you do n't want to wait in line I recommend downloading the EasyTaxi app and ordering a cab via the app . Take the cab to the Gran Puerto ferry port . <p> If you 're on a budget , take the ADO bus from the airport to Cancun 's central bus station ( MXN$66 /US$3.50 ) and change there into a colectivo ( shared minivan ) to the ferry terminal in Gran Puerto ( two blocks from the older ferry port Puerto Juarez ) . The colectivos stop right across from the ADO station in front of McDonald 's and cost MXN$8 ( $0.45 ) . The Ultramar ferry from Gran Puerto is MXN$160 ( US$8.50 ) for a round trip or MXN$80 ( US$4.25 ) for a one-way ticket . <p> The ride takes about 25 minutes . You can check the ferry schedules here , but ferries run several times an hour between 5am and 11.30pm . <p> Note:Returning to the airport from the ferry terminal , make sure to negotiate the taxi rate before you get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( US$37 ) , but I was able to get our driver down to MXN$300 ( US$16 ) . <h> Where to stay on Isla Mujeres <p> I 'd recommend staying in El Centro " simply because that 's where the best beach ( Playa Norte ) on the island is , and you have a variety of restaurants and bars to choose from . If you 're staying in another part of the island , you 'll be depending on taxis or renting a golf cart to get around . There are also not a lot of great beaches ( only a few small ones , most of which belong to private beach clubs ) and the beach is the island 's main draw.I did n't find many hotels that I loved on Booking.com , but saw a great selection of AirBnb apartments , most of which looked better than the hotels .

I spent the last thirty days between two of my favorite places in the world : Mexicos Yucat+n peninsula and New York City , and added my second new country of the year to the mix , which I happened to fall hard for : Cuba . <h> What Ive been up to <p> I started the month in Valladolid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to Valladolid in the past , the stops that followed where mostly new to me : Rio Lagartos with its pink lakes ; Izamal , Mexicos Yellow City ; Campeche , a coastal town filled with pastel colored Spanish colonial buildings , and Bacalar with its spectacular lagoon , which I somehow blissfully ignored when I lived in nearby Xcalak a few years ago . <p> Our next stops were two of my usual hangouts : Tulum and Playa del Carmen , where , for the first time in my three visits , I was unfortunate with the weather when we visited the Maya ruins ( grey and cloudy skies ) , and in Playa , the typically stunning beach was plagued by algae . <p> Our final stop on the road trip was Cancun , where I never spent much time before but discovered that the city outside of the hotel zone is actually not that bad . You can see some of our adventures in this short clip : <p> After bidding farewell to my road tripping buddy Chrys , I dropped off our trusted rental car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet up with my favorite travel companion in the world . <p> While our long-awaited Cuba trip did n't  start off as planned ( see What Went Wrong below ) , once we started exploring this fascinating island , everything went pretty smooth and we both fell for Cuba quickly . Havana in particular is a place we were immediately smitten by , but the picturesque Spanish-colonial town of Trinidad and the gorgeous landscapes around Vi+ales also made for a fantastic introduction to Cuba I say introduction because I have a feeling that I 'll be back soon . <p> Re-adjusting to the extravagant , lavish New York City life after poverty-ridden Cuba was harder than I thought . To be honest , I do n't  think Ive ever experienced culture shock to the extent I felt it this time . Going from nearly two weeks completely offline to being online again for 24 hours ( and arriving to 1,000 emails ) , from slow-paced days to rushed , meet-up filled days in NYC " it was definitely overwhelming . I am still struggling to get used to the frenzied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more caffeine and a huge increase in my expenses ( which tripled from what I was spending in Cuba and Mexico ! ) . <p> Add to that my attempts to become an official , legal resident , now that I have my green card , has been more time-consuming and more frustrating than I anticipated . Since most of this is still a work in progress , I 'll give you a full rundown on everything I 've done so far to become a true New Yorker ( other than drinking seven times more coffee than anywhere else in the U.S. ) in my next roundup . <p> Of course I 've also been busy catching up with friends in New York and I 've combined that with some cool things I wanted to check out in New York : an art installation in Green-Wood Cemetery , cherry blossoms in the parks , new street art , an overdue visit to the Oculus which I 'd been wanting to see since it opened last year , and eating some of my favorite foods in the city : Doughnuts ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Brooklyn bagels , to name just a few things that I miss when I 'm not here . Oh , and I even joined my first political protest ( ever ! ) and I 'm sure it wont be the last one . <p> Here are the highlights and lowlights of the month : <h> What went right <p> Deciding to visit Cuba <p> I had already mentioned that Cuba was n't really in my travel plans for 2017 , but as this trip began to take shape during the planning stage , the more excited I got . And it turned out to be the best travel decision I made this year ( so far ) ! Cuba was such a fulfilling traveling experience for one because I took a digital detox ( see below ) , and also because the country itself was such an intriguing destination : filled with natural beauty , but also thought-provoking and challenging due to its Communist regime , which for me turned into a trip down memory lane . <p> Road tripping with an almost stranger <p> When I spontaneously decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd talked to regularly online but only met once in real life , for a minute I had doubts if wed travel well together ( the past few years have shown me that I do n't  travel well with everyone ) . But the road trip was such a blast and we got on surprisingly well . Its always great for me to travel with someone who works online , too , and understands the needs for working hours , online time and planning a trip with a healthy work &amp; travel balance . That Chrys happened to be a runner , cake lover and vegetarian like me were added bonuses . <p> Not being homeless in New York <p> Whenever I returned to New York in the past three years , I knew where I 'd be living prior to my arrival . Funnily enough , this time around , now that I 'm finally a lawful permanent resident ' , I arrived not knowing where to stay after a splurge at The Row for a couple of nights . Just like it had happened in the past when I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housesit that saved me from having to sleep under the Brooklyn Bridge ( or crash on a friend 's couch ) . I read the inquiry while I was still in the air , on my flight from Cuba to NYC , and managed to secure the sit before I even touched down in New York . While I am looking for a permanent place in New York , I am housesitting and AirBb-ing my way all around town , but I hope that by the time I 'm writing my next monthly round-up , I 'll have found a place to call home . <p> Digital detox in Cuba <p> Oh , the dreaded digital detox . I guess I prepared at least somewhat for this by deliberately not buying a SIM card in both Colombia and Mexico , meaning I was only online when there was wifi , and not connected 24 hours , like I am here in the U.S. And guess what ? I did n't  have the withdrawal symptoms my sister was sure I 'd have , and I realized that I 'm fine without checking my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a scratch-off wifi card ( 60 minutes for $5 ) , but because I 'd heard that the wifi is painfully slow , I decided not to bother and waste my precious time in Cuba by waiting for websites to load , while getting frustrated over the slow wifi . The only thing that I started worrying about after a while was my family and loved ones and if they were okay . My offline time in Cuba made me wonder how I can reduce my online time more , because I can literally waste hours on social media and feel like that whenever I have the distractions of Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp around , my productivity is terrible . <h> What went wrong <p> Losing a day in Cuba <p> This was something beyond our control , but it put a major dampener on our trip : Miss G , coming to Cuba from NYC , missed her connecting flight in Atlanta , because the plane from New York was delayed due to engine problems . Until that day , I 'd never experienced the disappointment of waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The situation was made even more complicated by the fact that this being Cuba , I had no wifi and no way to find out what had happened until I left the airport , drove into Havana , and found a wifi scratch card ( which took me two hours to find ) . Luckily , she arrived the next day on the same flight , but it did cost us a precious day in Havana . I could have enjoyed the day on my own , of course , but I waited at the airport for hours , hoping she 'd still walk out of the gate , and by the time I had checked into our Airbnb , gone out in search of a wifi card , and finally found one , it was 8 o'clock in the evening . <p> Losing stuff <p> It seems like no matter how hard I try , I cant go a month without losing at least one thing . This month came with two major losses I left a fairly new iPhone charger plugged into the wall in our Airbnb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brand new spring jacket in the basket of a Citibike ( New York 's shared bicycles ) . Even though I went back to the bike station as soon as I realized I had left the jacket on the bike , by the time I got to there , the bike had already been taken out by somebody else and the jacket was gone . <p> Who needs a jacket anyway <p> Feeling Overwhelmed <p> While the digital detox in Cuba felt amazing at the time , and was probably good for me , the positive effects of it wore off in no time : I arrived in New York to 1,000 emails across my four email inboxes , causing me anxiety straight away . After having pulled an all-nighter before flying to Cuba in order to cope with my workload before going offline , I stayed up until 5.30am when I got to NYC to work my way through all my emails and react to the most urgent ones . I 've felt tired and overwhelmed ever since , because , in addition to my usual workload , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff that comes with being an immigrant , from mundane things such as opening a bank account and getting an I 'd to more complicated things like finding a place to stay ( which is nearly impossible for a foreigner without credit history and a steady pay check ) and trying to figure out the tax system ( please send help ) . That 's why it has been fairly quiet on the blog in April , but I hope I 'll get back to my regular posting schedule in May because I have a ton of content from Ecuador and Cuba that I 'm excited to share with you . <p> Take me back to these blissful beach days ! <h> Other happenings <p> Features and shout-outs <p> Here are some of the articles I 've written or contributed to in the past few weeks : <p> Well , I do n't  know what made me think I had a good chance of finishing four books in April , or even the slightest chance , because now all I can think is : what was I thinking , setting myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  quite make it through NoChocolateMarch ) . Instead of spending hours reading in Cuba , I was too tired to read more than a few pages on most nights . Our sightseeing schedule was just too crazy . That said , I have only gotten up to the second book of the Neapolitan Novels but I 've enjoyed them very much and will make an effort to read more to finish all four books . This goes along with my quest for less time online " instead of scrolling through Instagram pictures before I go to sleep , I want to get back into the habit of reading every night . <p> What I did instead of reading <p> Originally I had planned to cut out sugar in May , but since I need a success after two consecutive fails , I decided to change it up and challenge myself to run every day for the next 31 days . Since this might be too easy ( I run pretty much every day anyway ) I made this challenge a little harder by having to run at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only run 5k , but now I have to run 6.55 miles every day . <h> What 's next for me <p> Seven countries in four months the first third of 2017 has involved so much travel that I am looking forward to a month of sitting still . Of course I wont be sitting around all that much , considering I 'm in New York and there 's always something going on , and even in that short time that I 've been back I 've found myself exhausted from trying to fit in too much with too little sleep . Anyway , since I barely spent any time in NYC last year I am excited to be back in my favorite city in the world and am looking forward to eating my way around town , enjoying spring , checking out new places and catching up with friends . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107142870 @2542870/ <h> My Favorite Place in Iceland : The Ice Diamonds of Brei+amerkursandur <p> Steaming geysers , thunderous waterfalls , breathtaking canyons and vast lava fields " I saw more stunningly beautiful places in my week in Iceland than in any other country in such a short time . But my favorite place ? None of those . My favorite destination was the place that puts the ice ' in Iceland : J+kuls+rl+n , Iceland 's most famous glacier lagoon , and even more so Diamond Beach , just across the street from the glacier.When I parked our car in the little car park right on the black sand beach , I understood immediately why it was called Diamond Beach . Like bright diamonds in different shapes and sizes , dozens of chunks of ice litter the beach , giant waves crashing against them , moving the smaller ones around , forcefully repelled by the bigger ones.Walking towards the water , I started seeing more icebergs floating around in the ocean , being tossed around by the waves as if they were merely paper boats and not bulky chunks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there 's anything like Diamond Beach anywhere else in the world ( correct me if I 'm wrong ! ) . The icebergs in the water are chunks of ice that have broken off the glacier and then slowly floated down towards the ocean , through the lagoon and the short river that connects the glacier lagoon with the open sea.The lagoon was formed by the receding Brei+amerkurj+kull glacier , of which massive chunks of ice break off regularly . There are dozens of them floating in the lagoon before they slowly glide out into the ocean.Even though the sea is cold , the water here is warmer than in the icy lagoon , so the ice chunks are thrown around and smoothed by the waves , and eventually they are thrown back at the beach.You ca n't help but wonder how old the ice is that has been washed ashore " these pieces had been part of the glacier for centuries ! There are n't two days when this beach looks the same . Every day , new chunks of ice arrive and others melt , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the melting process and the constant washing of the waves.Back in the lagoon , in between the ice chunks , you can spot seals that make their way into the lagoon from the ocean , curiously inspecting the massive blocks of blue tinted ice.The light blue color of the ice was one of the most fascinating things about J+kuls+rl+n " the only other place I 've seen ice like this was at Puerto Moreno Glacier in Argentina.You often only see a tiny fraction of the entire iceberg " the bigger part is usually underwater . Some of them are as big as small houses ! J+kuls+rl+n translates to glacial river lagoon ' and only appeared in 1935 , due to the melting of Brei+amerkurj+kull glacier . Over the years , it has become Iceland 's deepest lake , currently 814 feet ( 248 meters ) deep . The lagoon has grown fourfold since the 1970s , to give you an idea of the current rate at which Iceland 's glaciers are melting.J+kuls+rl+n and the Diamond Beach are the one place in Iceland that I really want to return to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter months , when the sun rises late and sets early . Because apparently , seeing this place during sunrise ( the sun rises over the ocean ) is even more magical . 129333 @qwx989333 <p> How to get to J+kuls+rl+n from Reykjavik : There are organized tours from Reykjavik to J+kuls+rl+n , but renting a car would be preferable , especially if you want to take your time to take photos . The drive from Reykjavik takes just under five hours ( 231 miles/372km ) , and from Vik , just over two hours ( 119 miles/192km ) . <p> This would be an example for what NOT appropriately ( i.e. warm ) dressed looks like ! <p> All images were taken on the Highlights Of Iceland self-driving tour- by Icelandic Farm Holidays. - Icelandic Farm Holidays provides you with a rental car and an itinerary for every day , but you can decide individually how much time to spend in each suggested stop , or add additional ones .

@@107142876 @2542876/ <h> Why Berlin is a great base for exploring Europe <p> We have spent five weeks in Berlin now , and we have a confession to make : we might have found a place that could become our semi-permanent base at some point in the future . We would probably still spend the winter months in warmer regions of the world , but we can see ourselves spending three or four months in Berlin each summer " not only because we fell in love with the city itself , but also because it is a great base to explore other places in Germany and Europe from . Here is why we think Berlin makes a great base for exploring Europe : <p> The perfect location <p> Berlin is located in a perfect region to explore both Western and Eastern Europe from , it is close to Scandinavia and there are plenty of cheap flights to Southern Europe from Berlin . Rome and London are only a 2-hour flight away , it takes 3 hours to fly to Madrid , and even less than that to get to Istanbul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munich in six hours , to Prague in 4.5 hours and to Copenhagen in just under seven hours . <p> Europe Map with Berlin Germany <p> A convenient transport hub <p> Berlin is not only located perfectly , but it also offers a wide range of different modes of transportation to get around Europe . Several budget airlines , such as AirBerlin or EasyJet , connect Berlin with all major cities across Europe , including the Canary Islands and destinations in North Africa . <p> EasyJet connections from Berlin <p> Often times the train can be cheaper and faster " depending on how long in advance you book your train tickets . If you base yourself in Berlin and plan trips around Europe well in advance , you can book your train tickets online on the website of Deutsche Bahn , Bahn.com . Even though it 's the website of Germany 's national rail , you can also book tickets from Berlin to other European countries and find tickets to Paris for as low as 53 Euros , to Amsterdam for 39 Euros , or Vienna for 49 Euros . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers 50 per cent off any ticket you purchase , and you do n't need to book in advance . This card is valid for 12 months and definitely worth the purchase ( 127 Euros ) if you plan to take the train a lot . <p> Another inexpensive way to get around Europe are the buses , and Germany has just opened the long-distance bus network to private companies in 2013 , now competing with the rail system and offering bargains such as 8 Euros for a trip to Leipzig , 9 Euros to Hamburg , or 22 Euros for a ticket to Munich . Check out MeinFernbus.de , BerlinLinienbus , Flixbus , and EuroLines for international routes . <p> Even cheaper are Germany 's many carpooling services . When traveling between cities , drivers upload their trip , departure time and per-passenger cost and people looking for rides along the same route call , text or get in touch over the site to book a seat . Most of these sites have an English version and also offer rides on European routes , like Berlin " Warsaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite carpooling websites include Carpooling.com , BlaBlaCar , Flinc.org- and Mitfahrangebot . <p> If you prefer driving your own car , check out the special weekend offers by the big car rental companies that offer rentals from 14.99 per day or car sharing services , which offer cars in convenient locations around the cities . These companies are similar to rental companies , but they have more locations in residential areas , and can be booked on short notice simply via your smartphone for as low as 5 Euros per hour . You pay a registration fee when you sign up for a car sharing service ( around 29 Euros ) but if you are basing yourself in Berlin for a while , it is well worth it . There are several car sharing services in Berlin , for example : Cambio , Car2Go , DriveNow , CiteeCar or Flinkster ( the official car sharing service of Deutsche Bahn " if you have a Bahncard , there 's no registration fee ! ) <p> Citeecar in Berlin <p> It 's inexpensive <p> Of course you could use London , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base , but Berlin , Germany is so much cheaper ! You can still find a room in a flat share for less than 300 Euros per month or a one-bedroom apartment for around 500 Euros a month . Groceries are cheap in discounter super markets , and there are several fresh vegetable markets around the city , such as the Maybachufer Turkish Market , that offers whole boxes of avocados for as little as 3 Euros , ten boxes of strawberries for 2 Euros and a kilo of bananas for less than a Euro . <p> Going out is super cheap , too , with pints of beer for as little as 2 Euros and many bars offering happy hour prices for cocktails for around 3.50 Euros . Many attractions are free , and if you pick up a used bicycle for about 50 Euros at Mauerpark flea market , you do n't have to pay for transportation ( a monthly ticket for subways , S-bahn and buses is currently 77 Euros ) . <p> Not only are day-to-day expenses cheap in Germany , but a visit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventative cancer screening for 35 Euros , teeth cleaning starts at 45 Euros ) and health insurance for foreigners visiting Germany is extremely affordable ( three month coverage starts at only 15 Euros ! ) . <p> It is a great destination in itself <p> The city is not only a great base to explore Europe from , Berlin is a fantastic destination in itself ! One of the most vibrant and hip cities in all of Europe ( maybe even the coolest one ! ) , you wo n't ever get bored in Berlin . There are countless things to do , from museums to art galleries , flea markets and parks . Most of Berlin 's attractions are free , such as climbing the glass dome of the Reichstag , visiting the East Side street art gallery , and even several free walking tours around the city , from classic tours that include the classic sights such as the Brandenburg Gate and Checkpoint Charlie to edgier tours that explore Berlin 's subculture . <p> If you are ready for a break from Berlin , there are enough places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months : from picturesque Potsdam and Oranienburg to the over two dozen lakes around the city that make for perfect day trips , the nearby Spreewald and Havelland regions , or just over the border in Poland you have Szczecin , one of the liveliest towns in Poland with beautiful medieval buildings , Baroque city gates and a 14th century tower . <p> Have you been to Berlin ?

Throw some shopping and some relaxing spa time in the mix and everyone will be happy . <p> To give you a better idea of what a perfect girls ' getaway to Sonoma Wine Country could look like , I put together an itinerary for a weekend in Sonoma County , including where to stay , what to do , and practical information , such as : How would you even get there ? <h> Get in <p> I recommend flying straight into Santa Rosa , the capital of Sonoma County . The Charles M Schultz airport is tiny , but that 's what makes this a super easy travel experience . There are n't many direct flights to Santa Rosa , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Diego , Las Vegas or Phoenix , you 're in luck . Coming from NYC , I took a connecting flight to Santa Rosa from LAX , but I could have also flown into San Francisco and rented a car there . <p> You can get to Santa Rosa from SFO in just under 90 minutes , and you 'll want a rental car for your time in Wine Country anyway . Extra bonus if you 're driving up from San Francisco : You can drive up Highway 1 , aka the Pacific Coast Highway , which is arguably one of the most beautiful drives in the U.S. , followed by the Bohemian Highway , which winds through Redwoods and charming little towns . <p> Alternatively , you can rent a car at the airport in Santa Rosa " check Priceline or RentalCars.com for the best rates . <h> Where to Stay <p> There are hundreds of options for accommodation in Sonoma Wine Country " dozens of little towns , farmhouses , AirBnbs in the countryside how to decide what 's the ideal location ? I 'd recommend staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you fly in and out of there , but it is also a decently sized " yet compact " town with plenty of things to do right there , which means you do n't need to spend too much time driving . <p> Two hotels I 'd recommend are : <p> Vintners Inn " A 44-room boutique hotel surrounded by vineayards , that all have a balcony or their own patio . Every room comes with a half-bottle of Fume Blanc , ( a wine made by Ferrari-Carano , who own the hotel ) , perfect to start off a girls ' getaway . I love that the Vintners Inn is certified by the California Green Lodging Program , i.e. consciously making an effort to reduce their carbon footprint . The fabulous John Ash &amp; Co restaurant right on the property is well worth a visit , and next year a day spa will be added , which will make Vintners Inn even more perfect for a relaxing weekend . <p> The Flamingo This historic spa resort used to be very popular with the Hollywood crowd when it opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the nostalgia of this once posh and sought after hotel , even though these days it is neither particularly fancy or pretentious , but a reasonably priced option ( rates for a double room start at $125 on the official Flamingo website ) . The hotel has a state-of-the-art health club and spa , including a yoga studio , two Olympic-sized swimming pools ( heated ) , five tennis court and a restaurant with nightly entertainment . <p> Get your Bearings <p> If you are staying at the Flamingo Resort , you can start your exploration of Santa Rosa with a short walk over to Montgomery Village , an open air shopping mall with 75 shops and 12 restaurants " and do n't let the word mall ' put you off " I found the name village ' well chosen , since this is a cluster of shops set in an village-like environment with beautiful landscaping " nothing like an ordinary mall . <p> You 'll find a number of restaurants at Montgomery Village and if you want to have dinner there , I recommend Monti 's Rotisserie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopper here is , as the name indicates , the wood-fired rotisserie , but the menu also features enough vegetarian dishes to make me happy , plus Happy Hour cocktails and a comprehensive wine list . The cheeseboards alone were reason enough for me to love Monti 's Rotisserie , sea food lovers will love the oysters and shrimps , and meat lovers can feast on grilled and roasted specialties such as pomegranate-glazed pork ribs or oak-roasted chicken . <p> Dinner and Drinks <p> If you prefer heading into town , check out The County Bench Kitchen + Bar ( 535 4th St ) which only opened in 2016 but has already received a lot of praise , including a mention in Forbes ' 5 New Wine Country Restaurants You Need To Know About , and which upgrades Downtown Santa Rosa 's dining scene to another level , with hand-crafted cocktails and a chic bistro atmosphere . Not really a surprise , considering the restaurant is the brainchild of two Michelin-star chefs : Michelin-starred chef Bruce Frieseke ( Applewood , Bella Vineyards ) and Ben Davies ( Petite Syrah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on American cuisine , includes innovative dishes such as a Farro Risotto , Red Wine Braised Short Rib and $1.50 Happy Hour Oysters . Speaking of Happy Hour ( from 4-6pm on weekdays ) " the high-quality $5 cocktails and happy hour snacks are hard to beat , so if you prefer a light dinner made up of a range of small dishes to share , served with inexpensive cocktails and wines , the County Bench &amp; Kitchen is perfect for you . If I lived in Santa Rosa , the County Bench would be my regular hangout spot for sure . <p> For a more casual dinner , head to Left Coast Kitchen &amp; Tap Room ( 523 4th St ) , just a couple of doors down from The County Bench . Chef Gray Rollin ( who used to be a tour chef for celebrities like Katy Perry , Linkin Park , Justin Timberlake and Metallica ) and is dedicated to everything Left Coast ' " emphasizing dishes , beers and wines from the Pacific States : Alaska , Washington , Oregon , California , and Hawaii . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes ( pork sliders , steak , pork belly ) , but also vegetarian-friendly options such as a delicious roasted beet , goat cheese &amp; arugula salad , and grilled artichoke and truffle mac'n'cheese . And while I love wine , at Left Coast I was particularly impressed with the number of Pacific micro brews on draft . <p> If you 'd like to include wine in your first dinner experience " you are in wine country after all " make your way to Willi 's Wine Bar ( 44 Old Redwood Highway ) where you can enjoy local wines paired with delectable dishes made from locally sourced food . Do n't expect a fancy restaurant " Willi 's Wine Bar is a classic , laid-back roadhouse restaurant with both familiar comfort foods as well as inventive international bites , but expect the same quality that Monti 's Rotisserie offers " it is run by the same owners , Mark and Terri Stark . You can choose from 32 contemporary American as well as international small plates , perfect for sharing , divided into surf ' , turf ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After breakfast , it is time to walk off some of these calories . Drive to the nearby Armstrong Redwoods , which are about 30 minutes west of Santa Rosa , which make for one of the most magical forest experiences you 'll ever have . This serene , tranquil forest with majestic Redwoods trees does n't fail to impress , with trees that grow 200-250 feet tall and live to be 500 to 1,000 years old . <p> Tip : Park outside the State Park at the Armstrong Redwoods Visitor Center and save yourself the $10 fee for driving into the park . Walk instead , it is a gorgeous hike . Depending on your fitness levels , you can decide when to turn around , but it is a relatively small forest . <p> First Wine Tasting : Korbel Champagne Cellars <p> After this active morning , it 's finally time for your first wine tasting . Start off with an afternoon of wine tasting in style with some bubbly at Korbel Champagne Cellars , which you would have passed on your way to the Armstrong Redwoods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which includes a tasting , is completely free ( most wineries charge a fee for their tastings ) . <p> Francis Ford Coppola Wineries &amp; A Native American Lunch <p> You might know that Oscar-winning director Francis Ford Coppola has long had an affinity for wine : he bought his first winery in 1975 from the proceedings of the first Godfather movie . He now owns several wineries in Napa and Sonoma , and in 2016 he added another addition to his ever growing wine emporium the former Geyser Peak Winery which he renamed Virginia Dare Winery ( 22281 Chianti Rd ) , after the first child of English parents born in the New World . The other wines produced at Virginia Dare Winery also carry names based on folklore and history , such as White Doe , The Lost Colony or Two Arrowheads " but I 'll leave it to you to find out what these names are based on during a wine tasting . <p> If you have n't eaten anything at Korbel yet , I recommend having lunch at Virginia Dare , where the Werowocomoco Restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American food " something you do n't find very often , especially in this part of the U.S. The giant fry bread taco I had there was finger-licking good.If you want to check out another one of Coppola 's wineries , you can visit the Francis Ford Coppola Winery ( 300 Via Archimedes , Geyserville ) next , which is also located in Geyserville , only five minutes up the road from Virginia Dare . This one is the most spectacular of his wineries " Coppola himself describes it as a wine wonderland ' , and the stunning property , based on Copenhagen 's Tivoli Gardens amusement park , is well worth a stop . <p> The views are amazing , there are two connected swimming pools , a park with bocce courts and game tables and a movie gallery . The pool is open to the public , and you can also play bocce here " and of course taste wine . And if you 're a film buff , do n't miss the museum , where Coppola 's Oscars and a whole bunch of movie memorabilia are showcased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( again , only a five-minute ride away ) is Trione Vineyards ( 19550 Geyserville Ave ) , a family-owned winery with a small tasting room and bocce courts . <p> An Afternoon of Winery-hopping <p> From Geyserville , head to Healdsburg , which is only 10 minutes away . Healdsburg sits at the juncture of three prime winegrowing regions : the Russian River Valley , Dry Creek Valley , and Alexander Valley , so there are plenty of wineries to visit . In addition , you can explore the small town center , which has a number of interesting shops , including jewelry stores and antique shops , and over 20 art galleries . The walkable downtown has artisan bakeries , wine bars and restaurants " it 's a great place to stroll around for a couple of hours . <p> Back in Santa Rosa , take a nap after all those wine tastings or relax for a couple of hours before heading to Jon Ash &amp; Co for a memorable dinner ( perfect if you 're staying at the Vintners Inn where the restaurant is located ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most iconic restaurants , and one of the pioneers in local farm-to-table dining , having introduced the concept of cooking with local produce and seasonal foods " many of the vegetables and fruits used are grown in the on-site gardens . I recommend going for the four-course tasting menu ( $68 ) which is available with wine pairings ( $35 ) . <h> Sunday <p> Breakfast at Coffee &amp; Brew <p> To make the most of your day in Sonoma Wine Country , head to Coffee &amp; Brew for a quick breakfast " the owners of the cozy coffee shop , Alisse and Jessica , are coffee industry veterans , so you can expect an outstanding cup of coffee with your breakfast . You 'll find freshly baked pastries here , eggs , or their to-die-for avocado toast on Pullman bread very thick and prepared with seeds , lemon , and spices . <p> Sundays are for Art <p> Just around the corner from Brew is the Art Museum Of Sonoma County which used to be housed next door , in Santa Rosa 's historic Post Office building , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being small , the museum has some fantastic pieces and artwork by well-known modern artists , such as Andy Warhol , but it mostly features artists who have lived and worked in Northern California . <p> The History Museum might not be everyone 's cup of tea , but I happened to be in town for an exhibit that I was excited about : The Beat Goes On : Peace , Love and Rock &amp; Roll in the North Bay featured rock posters , artifacts and images that trace the influences of music , counterculture and rebellion in the North Bay Area . So it 's worth checking what exhibit is on while you 're in town . <p> Now it is time to combine art with wine " for that , head to Paradise Ridge Winery ( 4545 Thomas Lake Harris Dr ) on the outskirts of Santa Rosa , where not only will you get to enjoy some fine wines , but also some fine art in the delightful sculpture garden ( Marijke 's Grove ) on the grounds . In addition to the sculptures , I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the first Japanese winemakers in California , very interesting " who knew that there even were Japanese winemakers ! <p> Another aspect I loved about Paradise Ridge was that you can take a self-guided walk around the winery , including the vines , where plaques educate you about the entire wine making process . <p> Time for Lunch <p> Head to Rosso ( 53 Montgomery Dr ) for lunch , an unpretentious yet absolutely divine pizzeria and wine bar . Go for the truffled burrata , the calamari with green chili aioli or try the whole head of sweet roasted garlic , followed by one of their wood-fired pizzas which all have unique toppings . <p> Spring Lake Loop <p> After lunch , go for an easy hike around Spring Lake , just a ten minute drive from Rosso . Spring Lake Loop is an easy 2.3 mile hike on a trail that follows the lake shore . If you 're visiting during the warmer months , take advantage of the swimming lagoon or rent a boat . <p> Spa Time ! <p> Finish your girls ' getaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a body scrub will ensure you feel rejuvenated after this weekend , too . <p> If you 're staying at The Flamingo , you can also just hop in the pool for a while , and enjoy the spa facilities next door at Montecito Health Spa , for which all hotel guests receive complimentary use of the Spa and- Health Club facilities with all spa treatments 50 minutes or longer . <p> As for other spas in Santa Rosa , your two best options are The Best Day Spa ( 3082 Marlow Road , Ste B4 " B6 ) and Soulstice Spa ( 2462 W. 3rd Street ) . 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

The Redwoods are home to the tallest trees in the world , which- live to be 500-1,000 years old , grow to a diameter of 12-16 feet , and stand from 200-250 feet tall . Walking through the forest where- these imposing structures were towering over me , with moss-covered trunks of fallen trees on the ground , made me feel like I had entered some fairy tale world . I would n't have been surprised had a fairy appeared in front of me , asking me to make a wish. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sun rays make their way through the branches , keeping the forest darker and in deeper shade than most other forests Ive hiked through , which only added to the mystic aura . <p> The Armstrong Redwoods are supposed to remind visitors- of what this whole region used to look like : Instead of - being covered in vineyards like it is today , all of Northern California used to be covered in forests of these colossal , majestic Redwood trees .

@@107142880 @2542880/ <h> Arriving to the end of the world Ushuaia , Argentina <p> Alone on the top deck of the boat , I was the only one still willing to withstand the freezing winds , but there was just something magical about breathing in fresh air while bouncing through the magnificent Beagle Channel to let the accomplishment of arriving here actually sink in . <p> 35 days . That 's how long it took Dani and I to make our way through Chile 's Lake District and pass back and forth through Argentine and Chilean Patagonia to arrive in Ushuaia , the southernmost city in the world . <p> Sure we could have flown here from anywhere , joining the thousands of cruisers and other international tourists at the airport , but arriving to the 60,000 inhabitant city could never have felt as good as it did to go the long way down . <p> After a few minutes in solitude watching thousands of birds glide by under the imposingly low gray clouds , I joined the other 20 passengers , including Dani , down below inside the warm cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' various spots along the coast over the centuries . Sure , we were being served tea and cookies on board and were never going to be seafaring journey women , but it still felt mystical to be connected even in this way to the globetrotting explorers of the past with only 1,000 kilometers of water separating us from Antarctica . In fact , we were closer there than Buenos Aires , 3,000 km to the north . <p> Ushuaia was also of particular interest as the spot where the first same-sex marriage in all of Latin America took place on 29 December 2009 , which paved the way for nationwide legalization in Argentina just six months later . <p> The proximity to Antarctica makes Ushuaia the jumping off point for Antarctic cruises , but while there are possible last minute deals , these trips still cost $5,000 and up ( and up , and up ) per person . Plus , arriving on The Ice involves sailing through the infamous Drake Passage , some of the roughest seas in the world ( watch a video here ) in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Earth . Ushuaia was already freezing cold for the two of us summer chasers , and while several stores have warm clothes to rent out to the cruisers , we were almost ready to rent a few things ourselves and it was 6 C / 42F during our stay . <p> After the fast-paced trip southward to get here , we opted to relax for a few days rather than add a 5th and freezing cold continent to the list . There is plenty to entertain everyone for a few days . Ushuaia is a popular ski destination for South Americans during the winter months , hiking to Martial Glacier in Tierra Del Fuego National Park is also popular , but pictures we saw made it seem as though it paled in comparison to our trips to Perito Moreno Glacier or Glaciar Grande . The park is just 12km west of Ushuaia , however , and supposed to have great hiking trails with beautiful bay and mountain views . Our blogging buddy Alexandra was much more active then were in Ushuaia and wrote about her hikes in the Tierra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We decided that we wanted to see more of the wildlife that is indigenous to this part of the world , like penguins , seals , orcas and local birds , which is how we ended up on the boat to tour the Beagle Channel . <p> Choosing the tours seemed fairly arbitrary , as a number of huts right outside the port offer a variety of tours at similar prices . Shop around a bit as some include trips to see penguins , others take passengers out to the even more isolated H Island . Some tours have catamarans , others motorboats . We went with Patagonia Adventures ( ARS300/US$56 for a 4-hour trip incl. coffee and snacks ) . <p> The scenery here was intense and rough , empty islands previously populated by indigenous populations who rubbed sea lion and whale blubber on their skin year round to stay warm . The boat stopped at various points to admire sea lion colonies and hundreds of cormorants , and a scenic hike across a deserted island reminded us of northern Scotland . <p> Make no mistake , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Les Eclaireurs lighthouse is not only the southernmost lighthouse in the world , but also the point where the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean meet , which made us realize once again just how far south we were ! <p> If you are looking for some activities in warmer surroundings , there are a number of interesting museums in town for at or under US$10 , including the Prison Museum ( Presidio ) which housed some of the worst criminals of Argentina until its closing in 1947 ) , the Y+mana Museum , where you can learn about the indigenous Y+mana people to first inhabit Tierra del Fuego or the Museo del fin del mundo , or end of the world museum ' , which educates about the history , wildlife and settlement of the area . <h> Tips for your visit to Ushuaia : <p> 1 . Book accommodation in advance No matter if it is high or low season , hotels are astronomically expensive ( $200 for a basic double room ) , meaning relatively economical guesthouses and hostels are always booked . We walked around for over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hostel we would never recommend to anyone . <p> 2 . Cruisers " do n't book Ushuaia tours with your cruise operators For any South American cruisers stopping in Ushuaia your cruise will dock in the center of town and tours can be booked right on the shore for a fraction of what you will pay by booking on the ship . Cruisers on our Beagle Channel tour paid more than double than what we did , and could have just booked it that morning like we did . 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Hi Alex , you 're welcome = Ushuaia was so much more expensive than we would have thought , but if you bring US Dollars and get the Blue Dollar rate , it can be done on the cheap . Its definitely worth a visit , right ? <p> I had no idea Ushuaia was the site of the first same-sex marriage on the continent ! That 's pretty cool . I 'm still not entirely sold on the idea of visiting Ushuaia , thougha lot of the attraction seems to be the novelty and the superlatives of the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> There are tons of things to do and see in and around Ushuaia , Sam we only scratched the surface while we were there because we were pretty hiked out/ glaciered out / exhausted when we got there , but should we ever make it to Antarctica , I will definitely plan in a few days in Ushuaia again to explore the National Park . <p> I hope you 'll get to go there soon ! I am not sure about rentals/apartments there are lots of seasonal workers who go down there for the tourist seasons , so I 'd assume there must be places not sure if they 're affordable , though = <p> It looks like its worth visiting for the spectacular scenery along ! And those seals ! ! Its a shame the hotels are so expensive , but I guess its good for the local economy ( if there must be a bright side ) . <p> Hey heather , I do n't  think its about the local economy .

The scenery looks spectacular ! I 'd love to do some exploring of the surrounding area . <p> Whoa , I wish I would have even heard of that book before we got there that sounds very cool . Will pick it up perhaps as we are headed to Ecuador at the end of the year so obviously there will be some Darwin was here signs = <p> Thank you for your blog- planning our trip to Patagonia have bout 7 to 10 days which I know is not long- our goal is to see the highlights from the photos , there is no doubt that this area is amazing and beautiful but I feel that some of the scenes may start to look similar- if you had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time ) , what would cities and or destinations would you recommend in Patagonia beyond the lake district ?

If I added another one itd be Bariloche in Argentina . But it was a pain to get down to the other three places from there ( well unless you a enjoy a 27-hour bus ride through the pampa ) . You can easily spend three days hiking in El Chalten , and see Torres del Paine in a day like we did , or hike there for several days . El Calafate with Perito Moreno Glacier can also be done in a day ( do the glacier hike , I regret not having done it ! ) 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

I have to admit that during my last Asia stint , I was a bit lukewarm on Thai islands ; I just did n't  happen to visit one that I truly loved , and other countries in South East Asia just happened to be more beautiful islands ( at least in my opinion ) , plus I was spoiled having spent so much time in the Caribbean prior to my first trip to Asia . <p> However , I had high hopes for Koh Tao , the smallest one of the three famous islands in the Gulf of Thailand ( the other two being Koh Phangan and Koh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was n't wowed by any of the beaches but I couldve guessed that , coming from the Philippines where I visited some of the best beaches I 've ever been to ( I mean ..

@@107142883 @2542883/ <p> The first thing I noticed when I walked down the stairway , exiting the plane and setting foot on the hot tarmac : the stuffy , humid air . The relentless heat and the unique smell of the Caribbean reminded me of Central America.Watching colorful little houses , one after another , glide by out my window as the taxi brought us to our guesthouse , I thought to myself : this could be Costa Rica . Or Nicaragua . Or Panama . The resemblance of Panama grew even stronger when we , after putting down our bags , made our way into town and finally walked through the majestic clock tower in the centuries-old stone walls that still surround Cartagenas Old Town.Once inside the Old City , we started wandering aimlessly and got lost in the maze of colorful streets almost instantly . Initially , I felt very much reminded of Panama Citys old town , Casco Viejo , and overall , Cartagena and Panama City are n't  that different : both sit right on the ocean , have a well-preserved historic Spanish Colonial section- , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condo high rises , and malls.A Dreamy Spanish Colonial City <p> I usually extended my wanderings to Getsemani , the up-and-coming neighborhood just across from the Old Town and only separated by a small park ( more on that in a minute ) . The architecture here is similar to the historic center , and yet it feels like a different place . Not every house is renovated yet , and on many the facades are crumbling . You can feel that this used to be a rougher part of town.The main difference to the picture-perfect Old Town ? Theres street art everywhere . Most doors and walls are covered in murals , paintings , and meaningful messages , so it- makes sense that this is the part of town where a free street art tour is offered.This street art lover happily traipsed around the neighborhood one sweltering hot morning , following the young French tour guide who showed us the best murals and graffiti works , while telling us about the message of some of the political pieces and giving us more information on the artists . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour.But also for non-street art enthusiasts , Getsemani is well worth a visit with plenty of lovely cafes and some of the best-rated restaurants in Cartagena . It is poorer than Cartagenas historic center , and you can feel that tourists only started coming here recently.Most restaurants are new , and there are a number of boutique hotels in the freshly renovated buildings that are n't  more than a couple of years old.One of my most memorable evenings in Cartagena was having drinks on a tiny balcony at Bar Solar " the balcony just big enough to fit two chairs and a tiny table " overlooking Plaza de la Trinidad , the main square of the neighborhood . This little square facing a Spanish-colonial church is usually filled with old men gossiping and little boys kicking a football.A Sloth in the City Center ! <p> And the little park I mentioned before that separates the Old City from Getsemani Parque del Centenario ? If you are a wildlife lover , you ca n't miss it . When we returned from Tayrona National Park- where we barely saw any wildlife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then made the park an essential daily stop afterwards , hoping we 'd see this little guy again.We were n't lucky enough to have another encounter with Mr Sloth , but on subsequent stops in the park we saw monkeys , red squirrels and giant iguanas . <p> Bocagrande " High-rises and City Beaches <p> A couple of times , I ventured outside of Getsemani and the Old Town to Bocagrande , the modern part of town where you find most of the luxury high-rises , fancy hotels and most importantly : Cartagenas city beaches . I have to admit that I did n't  think these beaches were all that great , especially after visiting the beautiful Playa Blanca which translates to White Beach ( and which is aptly named for what it is ! ) , but I loved the sunsets there , when lots of kitesurfers are out in the water , entertaining the crowds on the beach.If you are going for the best sunset views I suggest you walk all the way to the end of the Bocagrande peninsula , near the Hilton Hotel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can enjoy some seafood and cold drinks ( Bar La Sirena , Brisas del Caribe and El Muelle ) . Getting Out of Town <p> If you have enough time , get out of town . Cartagena is hot and humid year round , and the days I escaped the oppressive heat were welcomed opportunities to not be soaked in sweat within an hour of walking around.The trip to Playa Blanca I mentioned above , 45 minutes west of Cartagena , was our first attempt to get to a beach outside of Cartagena . I had seen photos of it , and the turquoise water and powdery white sand was all it took to make me book a trip to the beach " it looked so much more appealing than Cartagenas city beaches.Sadly , we happened to pick a day that was particularly stormy stormy enough to cause a boat to flip over in a wave as it approached the beach and the water got up much higher on the sand than it usually does.It was still a nice day , but I was glad we had decided to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the wooden ramshackle thatched roof huts on the beach did n't  look particularly inviting to stay in ( a girl who had spent the night in one of them told me later that it was as hot as a sauna and that the mosquitoes were nearly unbearable ) . The other day trip from Cartagena I took was to take a bath in a mud volcano , which turned out to be a pretty .. um , interesting , trip . I detailed the experience this article : Six Things Nobody Tells You About Colombias Totumo Mud Volcano . <p> Looking back at my entire trip , I have to say that Cartagena was not only the perfect introduction to Colombia , but it also ended up being my favorite city- in the country . 129333 @qwx989333 <p> How to get there <p> By plane : There are direct flights from four US cities ( NYC , Miami , Fort Lauderdale , Atlanta ) , and daily flights ( indirect ) from all major US cities . If you 're arriving from within Colombia and speak some Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best deals on airfares I used it for every flight I booked in Colombia . Alternatively , use GoogleFlights or check the flights directly on VivaColombia and Avianca . <p> By bus : I 've found bus travel in Colombia to be safe and comfortable . RapidoOchoa goes all the way to Medellin ( 12 hours ) , but check airfares before booking a bus ticket " advance ticket offers make flying often cheaper than bus travel.By boat : The catamarans and boats sailing between Panama and Colombia were completely unregulated for years . However , recently there has been an effort to make the crossing more regulated , and the boats listed on BlueSailing.net have to meet certain standards and safety regulations . The price for the five day trip is around US$550 . <p> Where to stay <p> I 'd recommend staying in Getsemani or in the Old Town . The first time I visited Cartagena we stayed outside of the Old Town and we always had to catch a cab to get in and out of town which was time consuming and , frankly , annoying.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love any ( Mamallena , Media Luna " too loud , too cramped ) but I liked Hostal 1811 right in between Getsemani and the Old City . I stayed at Centro Hotel in the Old City , which could n't have been located more perfectly ! It is housed in a restored Spanish Colonial building and right in the middle of the action- . I saw some great deals for less than $50 on Booking.com for hotels like the Ibis right by the ocean , but there 's barely anything in that part of town and it 's too far to walk into the Old City . <p> Do n't  miss <p> The Cartagena Street Art Tour I took is a must for street art fans ! It leaves daily at 10am at Plaza De Trinidad.The amazing popsicles and ice creams at La Paleteria ( local 2 , Calle 35 #03-86 ) . Flavors include all sorts of exotic Colombian fruits , and if you want to be decadent , you can get it dunked in chocolate .

The Mud Volcano was COP45,000 ( US$15 ) , and the trip to Playa Blanca was COP50,000 ( US$17 ) . Note : You can get to Playa Blanca , which is located on Isla Baru , by shuttle bus or by boat . There are half day and full day tours . I opted for the more comfortable bus ride , which takes about 45 minutes .

@@107142884 @2542884/ <h> On Broadway : Our walk from Wall Street to Harlem Manhattan , NYC <p> When I told Jess , " I want to walk the length of Broadway , " she looked at me like I was crazy . <p> I know it sounded crazy , but I meant it . This was n't an impulsive declaration . Broadway splits Manhattan north to south 15 miles ( 24km ) , and when I looked into it further , Broadway actually runs through Manhattan , and then an additional 18 miles ( 29km ) across the Harlem River through- Yonkers up to the town of Sleepy Hollow in Westchester County . <p> What better way would there be to really absorb New York , I thought , than to walk at least the 15 miles south to north to the top of Manhattan watching the neighborhoods , people , architecture and overall vibe morph and shift throughout the day . I thought this was an amazing idea , genius in fact . Jess was n't entirely convinced . Luckily our friend Jaime came to town and he thought the idea was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it.Spoiler : We did n't  exactly make it the whole way . We started from 1 Broadway at 10am and ended at 125th and Broadway in Harlem seven hours and 13.7km ( 8miles ) later . <p> The day begins : <p> We actually started at our walk at the gorgeous statues at the grand entrance of the National Museum of the American-Indian south of Bowling Green . <p> The Financial District <p> We still bounced full of energy here , past ornate buildings and modern skyscrapers , Wall Street and the World Trade Center . This felt so New York to us all ! <p> Noho <p> 20-odd blocks later , and we ended up in Noho , an area of trendy lofts and great shopping . We may have slipped in to a few stores and shopped for a half an hour here and possibly bought shirts , shorts and shoes which we then carried 100 blocks north to Harlem . ( We got a couple of great deals ! ) Plus we got some fabulous pictures of the wrought iron fire escapes and intellectual graffiti in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ) . <p> Union Square <p> By midday this area is pulsing with as many break dancers as businessmen , and those poor survey takers jumping out in front of camera-toting tourists like us with their excuse me , miss , do you have a a minute ? line . The farmers market here is excellent , but we did n't  want to carry anything else . <p> Madison Square <p> Arriving here after hours of walking through New York , it was amazing how this part could feel like we had somehow now arrived to the quintessential part of New York City . Yellow cabs , traffic , and of course , the Flat Iron building , which Jaime and I spent ages here photographing . <p> Korea Town <p> Now a three hours in to our Broadway walk , we stopped for pizza and an eggplant Parmesan sandwich , ironically near Korea Town , as we knew , without a doubt , restaurant prices would double as soon as we reached the next section of Broadway : <p> Times Square <p> I love Times Square , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights and the chaos and the fact that it feels so New York even though there are only tourists here . For all those reasons , Jess cant stand Times Square , but we had fun taking crazy photos of the naked cowboy and cowgirl and other oddities that you can only find here ! <p> On Broadwaythe Theater District <p> Surrounding Times Square is the famous Broadway Theater District , but we ended up being distracted here by a bit of New York drama . The platform holding two window washers , high up at the top of a building just off Broadway , split in two . A crowd of confused tourists ( which we joined ) stood and looked up , commenting , questioning and actually talking to each as helicopters packed with news crews thundered overhead . We later heard they survived . The whole thing felt like the scene right out of a movie . <p> Central Park / Columbus Circle <p> It felt like a huge accomplishment once we made it to the corner of Central Park . I thought back past Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noho and Wall Street , it felt amazing how far we had come and now finally we were getting to an area of Manhattan we had n't  spent much time <p> The Upper West Side <p> This is where Manhattan and the scenes along Broadway slowly but completely changed . There were no more obvious tourists , the road has more trees , it widens out , the buildings turn into elegant condos and there is more of a calm , sophisticated neighborhood feeling . Our feet ached , time was running , and I had to accept we werent going to make it to the top of Manhattan . But would we make it to Harlem ? <p> Colombia University <p> There was a bench where Jess and Jaime sat down , if just for a minute , to rest their feet . I knew we needed more of a break , but I was suddenly completely re-energized at just how far we had come . So I gave them my best stern look and got them to their feet . Onward to Harlem ! Harlem <p> Unlike much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shift between the university and reaching Harlem was much more pronounced . Although this had to do with the time of day rush hour had now begun and people were rushing back and forth in what felt like a frenzy compared to the sleepy feeling of the upper west side , there was a complete shift in demographics . In the same way that the tourists began to disappear and we reached a more neighborhood vibe after Central Park , these last 10 blocks had a much more mixed population similar to Brooklyn than the whitewashed feeling from whence we had just come . Black , white , Latino , and hipsters pounded the pavement here to get home . As for us ? Jaime and Jess hit a huge wall and got super giggly , while I was both sad that we still had 100 blocks left until the end of our walk and relieved that we could head home and finally have a nice cold beer after a long summer day out on Broadway ! <p> Next Time <p> That 's right there will be a next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the to Broadway and 220th and the river ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> I could n't get over her ! ! She was happily taking photos with everyone and enjoying the attention = I hope well get to walk the rest of Broadway later this year we wont have time this week when were returning for a long weekend = <p> Wow ! this looks amazing ! I would love to go to NYC . For some reason I have this desire to go there in winter , but apparently its not the best time of year to go there . Your post made me want to go there even more ! <p> Thanks , Jo ! I want to come back one year around Christmas time it must looks so pretty ! With snow and the ice rink in Central Park = But I hate cold weather , so it would only be for a few days = <p> This is such a great idea . Given there is so much to explore along the way , it would be a cool idea to book a few hostels at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 days . Make a real trip out of it ! <p> Thank you , Candice = I think if you want to do see the whole Broadway properly , you really need a few days = I 'd love to see what Broadway looks like north of Manhattan , all the way up into Westchester . Maybe we can drive that part one day with a car . <p> I think there is no place in the world where we walk more than in New York ! I just keep walking for miles and miles without even thinking about it because these walks are always what truly makes our time in NYC ! Already excited about going back in October for another quick visit before heading back to South America = <p> Great story ! I found the account of your journey because of a search for exactly this adventure . My wife and I are in training for the whole route from Marble Hill to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal in one day . Waiting for the warmer weather and when the flora is in bloom .

@@107142886 @2542886/ <h> Eating my way through Malta <p> When I traveled to Malta last month , I had no idea what to expect in regards to food . What exactly is Maltese food ? And of course I worried a little that vegetarian options in Malta might be limited . I worried for no reason though ! Even though the national dish of Malta is rabbit , Stuffat tal-fenek , there are plenty of vegetarian options in the Maltese cuisine . <p> Thanks to the perfect location of the islands right in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea , Malta has always been on the trading route between Africa , the Middle East and Southern Europe , which consequently influenced the country 's cuisine . With people from different cultures passing through Malta on their travels from north to south or east to west , plus the various civilizations that occupied Malta over the centuries , Malta benefited from many more culinary influences than most other Mediterranean countries ( especially considering how tiny the island nation is ! ) , but at the same time , its food has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , such as tomatoes , olives , broad beans , citrus fruits and figs , are part of most meals , and surprisingly delicious locally produced Maltese wines and cheeses top off each meal . <p> Let me take you on a tour of my favorite Maltese dishes and introduce you to some of the best restaurants Ive eaten at in Malta and Gozo ! <h> Maltese Snacks <p> Maltese snacks are pretty addictive " especially the pastizzi . These little flaky dough parcels are filled either with ricotta cheese or with peas ( the pea version is usually not vegetarian though ) . They reminded me a lot of Cornish pasties- ( a specialty from Cornwall that I love ) , clearly influenced by the British presence on the islands . You will find them all over the islands , from cafes and restaurants to dedicated pastizzerias . See below for my recommendations on where to try pastizzi . <p> The other typical savory snack is the -ob++ bi++-++ejt , a sourdough loaf of bread dipped in olive oil and rubbed with ripe tomatoes , and then filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We tried a slightly different version of this dish " basically the ingredients ( plus Gozitan cheese ) not mixed together , served with bread and olive oil : <p> As a starter or a side with meals , you usually also find some pastes and spreads , like hummus ( the Middle Eastern influence ) , olive paste ( Sicilian influence ) , bigilla ( made from broad beans or tic beans " North African influence ) or an anchovy paste , all served with delicious Maltese bread which is baked in wood-fired ovens " creating a dark , chewy crust and a soft , fluffy inside or Maltese galletti , crackers that are normally homemade . <p> The best bread to try is Maltese ftira though , a flatbread with a hole in the middle and topped with amixture of tomatoes , eggplant , olives , capers ( and anchovies for a non-vegetarian option ) . I ( as a pizza lover ) could 've eaten this bread every day " for breakfast , lunch and dinner . <p> You 'll also often find Gbejniet as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheeps milk , which is then dried in baskets and served drizzled with olive oil and seasoned with crushed black pepper and sea salt . <p> Maltese cheese on the right <h> Maltese classics <p> While most of the classic Maltese dishes are n't vegetarian " for example Aljotta ( fish soup ) , Lampuki Pie ( fish pie ) and a variety of rabbit ( fenek ) dishes that include soups , stews , sauces , pastas and pies , there are several meat-free options . Soppa tal-armla , also known as Maltese Widow 's Soup , was one of the best soups I had eaten in months ! It is actually a simple soup , made with broad beans , peas , carrots and other vegetables that you might have , plus a Gbejniet ( the above mentioned Maltese cheese ) thrown in at the end . It does n't sound like much but trust me , it is to die for . In fact , I will try to make it at home with the help of this recipe . <p> Maltas specialty : Fernek ( rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Sicilian caponata " kind of a vegetable stew with zucchini , eggplant , peppers , tomato , garlic and onions which is easy to make and can be served with pasta or just bread . <h> Desserts &amp; Sweet Treats <p> The Maltese love their sweets , and I found myself constantly surrounded by enticing bakeries and pastry shops . Having visited just before Easter , I was lucky enough to be able to try figolli , a traditional Easter biscuit filled with almond paste and decorated with icing sugar . They come in different shapes and colors , sometimes also chocolate covered , but some bakeries also had a small version ( figollini ) . <p> A popular sweet year round are cannoli , brought to Malta from nearby Sicily ( supposedly home to the tastiest cannoli in the world ) . These little tubes of crispy fried dough are filled with fresh ricotta cheese , and sometimes chocolate chips are added to the ricotta filling , but I preferred the ones we were served with fresh strawberries . To die for ! <p> Luckily for me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding a treat with a good , strong cup of coffee . Even better : most of the pastries are filled with almonds or an almond paste , which I cant get enough of . <h> Drinks <p> Malta is n't necessarily known as a wine-producing country , but that does n't mean they do n't know how to make wine ! Maltese and Gozitan wines have won several awards in international competitions , and the grape varieties grown on the islands can easily keep up with Italian or French grapes . You 'll find Maltese Chardonnay , Merlot , Cabernet Sauvignon , Syrah , Grenache , Sauvignon Blanc , Moscato , Carignan and Chenin Blanc . The wines I tried were all fantastic . <p> Malta 's national beer is Cisk , founded in 1928 , and is traditionally a light lager . The brewery now also produces some stouts and pale ales , and even the Cisk Chill a beer lemon mix similar to a German Radler or a British shandy . <p> Farsons , the Cisk brewery , also makes Kinnie , Malta 's popular non-alcoholic soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark color ( lighter than Coke though ) , and reminded me more of a Campari Soda than a soft drink . I have a feeling it mixes well with wodka . <h> Where to eat in Malta <h> Valletta <p> I spent most of my time in Valletta , which is why most of my recommendations are for Malta 's capital . <p> They are famous for their homemade ravioli which are also sold in supermarkets throughout the islands ( look out for Nanna 's Raviolis ) , but also have crunchy pastizzi bursting with flavor , a big breakfast menu and in addition to traditional Maltese cuisine , you can get trendy dishes here ; like a yummy-sounding Quinoa salad , or a sandwich with roasted beets , spinach and goats cheese " the perfect combination ! I know I 'll have to go back there the next time I 'm in Malta because I did n't get around to trying their dessert ravioli ( filled with a chocolate hazelnut cream need I- say more ? ! ) . <p> You can try qaghaq ta l-ghasel , honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous savory bread snack -ob++ bi++-++ejt ( see Maltese Snacks above ) , or pick up some figolli around Easter . They also have a huge selection of pastizzi , or you could go for a rabbit dish or the Maltese Platter which includes most of the snacks mentioned above , plus the tasty Maltese bread and galletti . <p> Address:244 Republic Street , Valletta <p> Badass Burger <p> As the name indicates , this place serves truly Badass Burgers , but also plenty of options for vegetarians , including a veggie burger , sandwiches and salads " my rucola spinach salad with buffalo mozzarella and roasted sunflower seeds was divine ! <p> I also love that their dessert menu includes Banoffee Pie " my favorite British sweet treat ! I was beyond excited to find a Banoffee Pie after so many years without and I had to order it . In fact , I had to go back the next day to also try their Banoffee milkshake which did n't disappoint " not only because it came in a huge milk bottle ! <p> La Mere is a solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they basically have something for every palate : Maltese , Indian , Arabian and Mediterranean cuisine . You can get anything from an authentic Indian curry to fresh fish or salads or a typical Maltese Platter with Bigilla , Maltese cheese and galletti . Tip : they have a large lunch menu that is great value for money . <p> Address : 174 Merchant Street , Valletta <p> The Grassy Hopper <p> The Grassy Hopper is a small but excellent vegetarian/vegan restaurant that is not much more than a hole in the wall in Valletta . They also have a food truck that you 'll find in Gzira . Here you find all the things that make a healthy eater 's heart beat fast " smoothies spiked with spirulina , wheatgrass , raw cacao , macca or bee pollen ; salads with kale and buckwheat , and a number of vegetarian burgers that leave nothing to be desired . Due to the tiny size of their shopfront , they have a daily changing menu , which you can always find updated on Facebook- regularly . <h> St Julians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malta " I 'd consider staying in Sliema next time just so that I can eat at Gululu 's every day . And even if you 're not staying in Sliema or St Julians , Gululu is worth the trip there ( super easy &amp; quick from Valletta on the bus ) . This is the place to go if you want to try some really good Maltese food and wines , at surprisingly low prices . <p> The ftira here is out of this world , ranging from traditional toppings to more exotic , modern versions . If you 'd like to try one of the famous Maltese rabbit dishes " this is the right place for you . You can also devour fresh fish , homemade pasta or a yummy salad . My rucola , honey-roasted pumpkin and goats cheese salad was simple , but heavenly nonetheless . <h> Gozo <p> Ta ' Rikardu <p> Ta ' Rikardu needs to be on your list of places to visit for the views alone ! Head up to the rooftop terrace of the historic medieval building inside of Victoria 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass of wine and some traditional Gozitan cheese ( Gbejniet ) both made on the family 's vineyard and farm .

I basically bolted out my office and grabbed a huge plate of gyros from the Greek vendor downstairs ! Anyways , I 've always thought Maltese food would be closer to Italian , but I suppose they 're also highly influenced by mediterranean cuisine ( Turkish , in particular , comes to mind ) . Everything looks SO delicious ! <p> All the food looks amazing , we are staying in Valletta for 3 days and was not sure where to eat , now we have quite a few options , thanks we will definitely check them out and also the ones In Gozo .

Ill be sharing my favorite photos of Valletta shortly = I think you should start off your time there with a Maltese Platter at Caffe Cordina ! Enjoy your trip ! <p> Excellent pictures and lovely descriptions . The picture with the harbor looks like Monaco but the food is much more attractive . Thanks for the prices . Malta looks like a place I need to check . I spent some time in the south of France and loved it . But it was really expensive . Malta appears to be cheap and I think the weather and the feel of the place is similar Mediterranean feel . I wonder about rents . I need to watch out on bread , pastries and pizza though . I gained a few lbs in France pretty quickly . <p> Hi there ! I 've " seen " you around but I 'm making a comment for the first time LOL ! I had no idea that Maltese food was this varied and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin , and already I feel that perhaps a plate of Maltese ftira and the rabbit dish , and those delightful Maltese snacks , and thouse local cupcake things , are absolutely in order ! <p> Hi , I 'm Maltese and I 'm so glad that you enjoyed your stay ! I 'm so happy that you appreciate the Maltese culture and the cuisine but I could n't help but notice that you did n't  mention Bigilla .

@@107142887 @2542887/ <h> Go BeyondCentral Santiago , Chile <p> With no Eiffel Tower , no Taj Mahal , no real famous tourist attractions to speak of , even Santiago locals will tell you there is n't much to see in their city but up until our very last day in town we were discovering great spots widespread throughout the Chilean capital . Read on to find out how to go beyond the main sights in Santiago , and if you have only a short stop in town , check out our Santiago quick guide which covers all the things you should n't miss on a visit to Santiago . <h> Visit Barrio Yungay and El Golf <p> Lastarria is Santiago 's showcase neighborhood , with colonial and neo-colonial architecture , wine bars and top dining options , while Bellavista is the most popular neighborhood for budget travelers popping seven nights a week , with student bars , cheap eats and vibrant nightlife ( think drum parades and lots of outdoor drinking ) . However , Barrio Yungay and nearby Barrio Brasil are home to sprawling 19th century mansions of wealthy landowning Santiague+os @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze and cute local cafes to pass the time . We first discovered the two neighborhoods on our free walking tour with Spicy Chile , which is a great way to get a much more in-depth perspective on these areas . <p> Glass towers , modern office buildings and the epicenter of Chile 's future forward urban mentality are set in Las Condes and El Golf , just a few miles and worlds apart from the Barrios . Contemporary architecture , like the Santa Cruz Del Sur Tower at the Escuela Militar Metro Station , reveals the capital 's pride in its booming economy . In our opinion , a visit to Las Condes is worth it for Tiramisu alone " easily the best pizzeria in Santiago and just down and around the corner from the luxurious W Santiago and Intercontinental Santiago hotels . <p> Modern vs historic Santiago : Barrio Brasil vs Las Condes <h> Los Dominicos market <p> Even those who do n't normally head to a city 's central market should make the Mercado Central a stop " especially if you love seafood . Fishmongers line the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the historic market building . Head across the river , however , and you 'll get a much more local experience at the Mercado La Vega produce market . It 's booming , busy and a bit grubby , but you can stuff your bags from massive piles of ripe avocados , tomatoes , quinoa , blue corn , bunches o fresh cilantro , chives and buckets of garlic , olives and cheese . For an even more off-the-beaten track experience , take the Red Line ( Linea 1 ) to the last stop : Los Dominicos market . Close to the Andes mountains , this is a lively outdoor tourist market without hordes of tourists . Over 150 artisan market stands sell traditional Chilean handicrafts such as wooden pieces , leather , glass , wool , and of course lapislazuli , the country 's unique stone . You can watch artists at work and , on weekends , enjoy traditional dance and music performances . <h> Visit Parque O'Higgins and Parque Bicentenario <p> On a quick trip to Santiago , you 'll most likely pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood sooner or later , and you might wander into the Parque Quinta Normal after your visit to the fascinating , heartbreaking Human Rights Museum across the street . Surprisingly green Santiago has two other parks we can highly recommend . <p> First is the Parque Bicentenario , or Bicentenial Park , in the fashionable , high-income Vitacura neighborhood . On the weekends , the park is packed with posh locals and their many , many dogs , but during the week , you 'll have the sun chairs and umbrellas to yourself and make sure to sip a Pisco Sour at the chic Mestizo restaurant on the north end of the park . Parque Bicentenario is also only a couple of blocks from the Ralli museum ( see below ) and can easily be combined with an afternoon of art . <p> All the way across town , Parque O'Higgins is Santiago 's largest park and also home to Fantasilandia a medium-sized amusement park with roller coasters and all the typical for-all-ages Disney-like fun for under US$20 ( CPS8,990 ) . The park itself is set around an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events in the summer months . If you take the Green Line to Parque O'Higgins , you 'll find yourself right inside the park . <h> The Ralli Museum or the Sculpture Park <p> Well-heeled locals will occasionally complain of a dearth of culture in Santiago , but we say you just need to know where to look . Art lovers usually make a beeline for the Palacio de Bellas Artes ( Museum of Fine Arts ) and the Contemporary Art Museum right next door . However , tucked in to a side street in Vitacura , the Ralli Museum is a collection of contemporary Latin American art including both paintings and sculptures by Dali and other greats ( Chagall , Miro ) . The museum is free , staff is helpful , there are no photography restrictions and , the best part " most locals do n't even know about it , meaning it is usually fairly empty . Combine this with a picnic in Parque Bicentenario ( above ) for a great day out in Vitacura . <p> Santiago is a city filled with public art and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration can be found in the city 's Sculpture Park . Within walking distance of the Gran Torre de Santiago , which will be the tallest building in South America when it is finished , the park has over 30 wood , bronze and steel pieces by popular Chilean artists . There is no admission fee and you can sit in the park enjoying a book or a picnic lunch . The closest metro station is Pedro De Valdivia , which itself is home to beautiful public art inside the station . <p> Do you live in Santiago , or have you recently visited , and have a Go Beyond recommendation to share ?

You definitely discovered some of the places I always tell visitors to check out plus even some places I 've never been like the Ralli Museum . Thanks for sharing what makes Santiago a fun place to visit and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well worth a visit = Well actually visit another Ralli museum here in Uruguay next week , hope itll be as good as the one in Santiago was ! One thing we loved about Santiago was that there was always something new to explore there is just so much to see ! <p> The proper naming for citizens of Santiago de Chile is " santiaguinos " . " Santiague+os " is for the people who live en Santiago del Estero , Argentina . ( And the townfolk of Santiago de Cuba , is called " Santiagueros " ) 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142888 @2542888/ <h> 33 Things We Love About Chicago <p> 1 . The views over the city You will spend most of the time downtown looking up at mile high skyscrapers in Chicago , but both the Willis Tower and the John Hancock offer excellent views from above as well . These really put the city into perspective.2 . Cycling along the Lake Shore From the far northern neighborhoods of Chicago all the way through downtown , the Lake Shore cycling path allows cyclists to sail through 10-15 miles right along the shores of Lake Michigan . This is great for a work-out , and you 'll no doubt share a lot of the space with the hundreds of joggers and walkers out there , but this also keeps you out of Chicago traffic as well . Chicago is a great cycling city in general and with the Bikeway cycling program , cycling is set to be an integral part of transportation in Chicago in the future.3 . Chicagoans The people in Chicago are some of the friendliest big city folks weve come across . I used to always wonder what people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unlike in New York , L.A. or even Atlanta , the people in Chicago will strike up conversations with strangers , smile at you , help you out if you 're lost and give you change without too much of an attitude . <p> 4 . Oak Street Beach In the summer months , between the palm trees , the joggers and the beach bodies laying out , it would be easy to mistake this beach for somewhere on the coast except for that giant John Hancock building looming overhead ! Yup , this is unmistakably Chicago , and its hard to resist a few hours here on the weekend with the sand between your toes . <p> 5 . The diverse neighborhoods As soon as you move out of the downtown Loop area , Chicago is home to hundreds of ethnic enclaves bordering one another . I love how , in some parts of the city , you might see bilingual shop or traffic signs , neither language being English . A long walk through the neighborhoods might bring us through Polish , Mexican , El Salvadorian , Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple wander through town and all the sights , smells , eats and languages that comes with that . <p> 6 . The beautiful- Rosehill Cemetery Near Andersonville , with its eccentric and unique graves and monuments , Rosehill feels more like an old-world European cemetery than anything in the new United States . <p> 7 . How the wooden elevated El- train tracks wind around the roofs of the houses of Chicago.8 . Baseball at Wrigley Field You do n't  know a thing about baseball so what ? Head to Wrigleyville during the Spring or Summer months and pick up a pair of tickets to a baseball game . Get a funny hat , drink a few beers and take part in the grand Chicago tradition that stems back to the early 1900s . Make a whole night of it and get there early enough to watch fans , touts and TV crews arriving in en masse and stake out a couple of bar stools at one of the local bars both before and after the game to take part in some crazy drunken festivities .

Lincoln Park Zoo This zoo , right on the lake , is one of the best free things to do in Chicago , and makes a great jumping off point to test out restaurants in the Lincoln Park area as well . <p> 12 . Boystown Chicago is about as gay-friendly as U.S. cities come , and the Boystown is huge fun . You 'll know you 've arrived when , driving up Halsted Rd. you start to notice huge gold pillars on the sides of the road marked with beautiful rainbow designs . There are plenty of shops and restaurants here to discover , but if you 're up for a knees up plan for a late night out here on Halsted ! <p> 13 . Nookies restaurant Also located on Halsted in Boystown , you 'll also find the original Nookies and a line out the door most weekend mornings . Pancakes , omelets , comfort food to the extreme , Nookies is by far one of my favorite hangover breakfast spots in the city . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has expanded to four locations including Nookies Old Town , Nookies Lakeview , Nookies Lincoln and Nookies Edgewater . <p> 14 . Walking through the streets of downtown Chicago and getting dizzy looking up to the skyscrapers . <p> 15 . Lincoln Square with its neighborhood feel and excellent German restaurant Not to be confused with Lincoln Park , Lincoln Square is much further north and has a neighborhood feel that would make you swear you 've left the city . Except you 're still well within the city limits . We spent some time here housesitting for a friend last fall in Chicago , and definitely could be persuaded to spent a bit longer here in the future . <p> 16 . The vegan restaurant Native Foods Cafe So far there are three outlets of this California vegan restaurant chain in Chicago , and we could eat here every day and not tire of the selection .

I have a business card holder and a fun little clutch purse along with me on my travels that I picked up at Spare Parts . <p> 18 . Playing around with the reflections of the Bean <p> 19 . The Map Room An obvious choice for a couple of world travelers we absolutely love this bar !

I mean , at this travelers inn you can even attend beer school to sample some of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The famous Garretts Popcorn Mix At Garretts you can get cheese , caramel , or plain . But everyone knows that its the popcorn mix of Cheese and Caramel popcorn that tastes the best . If you do n't  pick up a bag while downtown , Terminal 3 at OHare airport has a stand for last minute bag of Garretts , too ! 21 . Blues bars In the same way we loved the authentic music scene in New Orleans , we love that Chicago maintains its thriving blues scene . In the paraphrased words of one of my favorite Chicago films , nobody should leave this place without singing the blues . <p> 22 . Second City Chicago is also home to some of the funniest people on the planet , who all found their feet at Chicagos Second City comedy theater . Make sure to stop here on a visit too you 'll probably see the stars of tomorrow or you can try an improve class there yourself while you 're there . <p> 23 . The German Christkindl Market Taking place in the run up to Christmas each December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany . We spoke German to all the workers , drank Gluhwein , had amazing Kartoffelpuffers ( potato pancakes ) and just had a great time when we were here last time , despite below zero temperatures . <p> 24. - Chicago Superfans piling out of Sports bars Chicago is also a city of sports fans , and there is nothing better than festive Saturday and Sunday afternoons in the Spring , Summer and Fall , when bars and restaurants spill over with fans wearing jerseys not just from Chicago or Illinois , but from the competition , too . <p> 25. - Art Institute of Chicago This art museum is such an interesting and intelligent collection , with pieces that even people who hate art museums will enjoy . We paid the full entry price to get in , but check out the Art Institutes website for details on free nights as well . <p> 26 . The fantastic Gay Pride Parade in June <p> 27 . Ethnic Restaurants Chicago is a diverse city , and as a result , we ate our way around the world last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Salvadorian pupusas around the corner from a local corner Serbian restaurant , Thai food at PS Bangkok ( among many others ) , original Ethiopian cuisine , loads of Korean food , German ( Bavarian ) restaurants everywhere , there is even a Costa Rican and a Guatemalan restaurant in the city . Now hows that for specific Latin American cuisines ! <p> 28 . Watching beach volleyball on North Ave beach Do this in the summer and you would swear you 're in California . Each weekend there are major tournaments for both men and women the best in the world have played here ! <p> 29 . The tasty-licious Taste of Chicago festival in July Go hungry or go home ! There are hundreds of Chicago restaurants and bars with stands at the Taste each year . Although they are scaling back in size from years past , this is still one of the most delicious food festivals in the world ! <p> 30 . The National Museum of Mexican Art This small museum location in Pilsen , a traditionally Mexican-American neighborhood of Chicago , is home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who visits some big lessons about Latino life in Mexico , the United States and specifically Chicago . Considering that over 1.4 million Mexican-Americans live in the Chicagoland area , these are very important insights for a large part of what makes Chicago the city that it is . <p> 32 . Farmers Markets Chicago seems to becoming one of the healthiest major cities in the U.S. and in addition to great cycling options , we noticed an influx of famers markets throughout the city from right downtown on State street to many twice-weekly markets in neighborhoods throughout the city . In fact , there are more than 100 farmers markets in Chicago , according to the Chicago Sun Times . <p> 33 . Looking over the frozen Lake Michigan in winter Despite that California feeling in the summer , man oh man can Chicago get arctic in the Winter . Danis first visit to Chicago was during the winter , and we took her out onto the ice on Lake Michigan , which was frozen for many snow-covered feet . She could hardly believe her eyes when we arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stood the winter before ! <p> I 've lived in Chicago for 10 years and this captures everything that rocks about the Windy City perfectly ! Great job . Nice to see lesser known ( to tourists ) stuff mentioned like Lincoln Square , the Christkindlmarket and all the great ethnic neighborhoods &amp; food . <p> Aw , Katie , that is awesome of you to say ! Seriously , every time I come back and spend time in the city I realize what a truly world-class city Chicago is . Hopefully our paths will cross and youll be in town next time were in the city . <p> Looks like we enjoy a lot of the same things ! I love biking along the lake . The one thing I think is overrated is Garretts . I 'm already bracing for the backlash when I slam Garretts in an upcoming post = <p> Oh , were gearing up for the backlash already ! You do n't  like Garretts ? = Dani was completely disinterested in popcorn before Garretts and now she is a huge fan both of G. specifically and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 shared things we love about Chicago ai n't  bad ! <p> Sounds and looks amazing ! Chicago is so high on my want-to-travel-there list , but I 've yet to make it . The beach really surprised me . Looks amazing ! And all the food options sound so good . I 'm more of a regular Italian pizza kind of girl , but I would love to try at least one true deep dish . And the popcorn ? Yummy ! And then there seems to be so much to do and see ! ! The biking at the shore sounds great . <p> Oh , you have to go to Chicago , yes yes yes ! The food is great and well give you other tips if you want but do n't  worry about the pizza . You know how it is in America , that there is a load of cheese . You 'll eat the deep dish style once or twice , and its an insane amount of cheese . But we have other thin crust pizza in Chicago , what the locals actually eat , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chicago-style pizza is really good . But while I was trying to make Dani love American pizza , she actually won and got me to prefer Italian-style , so I get you there = <p> Haha ! That 's funny = So , maybe skip the deep dish altogether ? The amounts of cheese on that do scare me a little anyways despite the fact that I could eat a ton of cheese with bread any day . And I already pinned your post on my US Travel board for inspiration if and when we get to go . So much to see ! <p> Thanks for pinning the photo . I think you should try one slice . Its really tasty , and the crust is different its a cornmeal crust , unlike what you would have had before . Go with a few friends , get a medium and enjoy it just go hungry ! = <p> Hi Megan thanks for stopping by . You should try Chicago , its a great city ! But I need to give Texas a try , too . I 've only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Austin is definitely a must in the next year or so . Perhaps our paths will cross = <p> Yay Chicago ! Amanda , I 'm still sad I did n't  get to meet you last year when our paths crossed , but glad you and Dani got to hang . Let 's try for this year , we hope to be in town for the Taste of Chicago , maybe ? 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142891 @2542891/ <h> 48 Hours in Santiago de Chile <p> The booming Chilean capital can be hard to figure out for some tourists , but Santiago has so many beautiful attractions " from sprawling markets to vast parks , and picturesque neighborhoods to world-class museums . 48 hours is nowhere near enough time to soak up the true nature of this five million strong South American city , but following this guide will give you a true taste of the city , from its main attractions to its most charming markets and quarters , plus where to find the best views and where to devour typical Chilean dishes and drinks . <h> Day 1 <h> 10am : Plaza de Armas and the cathedral <p> Before you start your tour , get yourself a BIP card for public transport ( available in all metro stations ) . You can buy single use tickets for the city 's efficient , clean , art-packed metro system , but buses accept BIP cards only , so it makes the most sense to use it for both . Pay 1,500 Pesos ( $2.20 ) and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pesos ( $7.36 ) should be plenty even for an active 48 hours in Santiago . <p> Exit the metro at the beautiful Plaza De Armas , the city 's central plaza and home to kilometro zero , the central point from which the city has continued to sprawl out in all directions . The plaza is home to historic buildings such as the incredibly ornate Central Post Office , the Palacio de la Real Audiencia and , as in nearly every Latin American city , the main cathedral . Although it might appear a bit bland from the outside , do not skip a trip inside , which is packed with impressive details and treasures you would never guess were there from the building 's fa+ade. <h> 1pm : First Views Over Santiago <p> Once you reach Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins , turn left and head towards Cerro Santa Lucia . Set just inside the mighty Andes Mountains , Santiago itself is mainly flat , but there are two cerros ( hills ) right in the city center that afford perfect views of the city . Santiago was founded right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more as a lookout over the trendy Lastarria neighborhood and , on a clear day free of smog , the views that spread out over the city to the Andes mountains beyond . The hill itself is gorgeous , with majestic fountains , intricate Spanish tile work , even a European style ( mini ) castle and gorgeous gardens on every level , all the way to the top . <p> If you 'd prefer to sample Chilean wines , you can do this just a few doors down at BocaNariz ( Lastarria 276 ) . They have over one hundred native wines on their menu and also offer several sample options where you can try three different 50ml glasses of wine . Our tip : the Fresh &amp; Fruity white wine sample on a warm afternoon is perfection . <p> You could eat in any of the many restaurants on Lastarria , but for a hearty meal head to La Fuente Alemana for a truly Chilean lunch experience even Anthony Bourdain stopped here for lunch and loved it . This old-fashioned diner-style restaurant has seats around a large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the counter and watch the cooks prepare massive lomitos " Chilean-style sandwiches loaded with roasted pork , avocado , lettuce , tomato , cheese and other ingredients . There are other branches around town , but the most central we 've seen is at Avenida Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins just across the river from Barrio Bellavista near the Baquedano metro station , just a short walk further down from the Lastarria neighborhood , on the way to the next stop : Bellavista . <p> After you 've eaten , head further east from here , either on Merced or Parque Forestal , the park across the street , until you get to Plaza Italia . <h> 5pm : The Bellavista Neighborhood and Street Art <p> Once you have reached Plaza Italia , turn left and cross the Mapocho River and you will find yourself on Pio Nono , the main street of the Bellavista neighborhood . Bellavista is a bohemian area with a fun , youthful vibe that is packed with restaurants , bars and clubs , many of which are located on P+o Nono street . Pio Nono leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meander through the side streets of this barrio to see centuries ' old mansions , colonial houses and the best street art in the city . Bellavista is also home to Pablo Neruda 's Santiago home La Chascona ( just follow the signs up around the hill ) and definitely check out Patio Bellavista " filled with shops and restaurants , including one of my favorite breakfast/brunch spots " a French bakery/restaurant called Le Fournil. <h> 6.30pm San Cristobal Hill <p> Take Pio Nono to the end to reach the bottom of Cerro San Cristobal , the city 's second highest hill with a 14 meter tall Virgin Mary statue on top that can be seen far and wide . San Cristobal affords the best views and if you are not too tired , you can hike 45 minutes to the top . If steep hikes on uneven terrain are n't your idea of fun , you can also either hop on the funicular ( when it 's working ) or take a free bus up to the top ( when it 's not ) . <h> 9pm : Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy clothes at home and make your way to La Piojera , a gritty cantina just around the corner from Mercado Central ( Calle Aillavilu 1030 ) . This local watering hole is the ultimate Chilean experience , packed with the entire gamut of Chileans ( and a few savvy out-of-towners ) , all there to enjoy the bar 's infamous Terremotos ( earthquake ) , a deliciously strong drink made of Pipe+o ( a sweet fermented wine ) , pineapple ice cream and Fernet Branca ( herbal liquor ) . A half liter costs less than US$4 and is enough to make you stumble ( hence the name ) . <p> A Quieter Alternative : The Clinic Bar <p> La Piojera can get pretty crowded , loud and rowdy , especially in the summer months and on weekends . If you are looking for a quieter , more intellectual vibe , I recommend The Clinic , named after the satirical Chilean newspaper The Clinic ( comparable to The Onion ) , which pokes fun at the country 's right wing party in posters and the menu " which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish , you can get great insight here of Chile 's current political issues , relationship with neighboring countries and also some witty , sharp international commentary . Along with the political statements you can also enjoy typical Chilean dishes and drinks here . <h> Day II <h> 9am : Barrio Brazil and Yungay <p> Assuming you 're up and running the next morning after your big night out , do n't skip a morning trip to Barrio Yungay and nearby Barrio Brasil . Here you 'll find sprawling 19th century mansions of wealthy landowning Santiague+os , quiet squares with towering exotic trees rustling in the breeze and cute local cafes to pass the time . Although these two neighborhoods are just a few metro stops from the Plaza de Armas , most people do not visit here . The best place to start is the Republica Subway Station ( on the red line ) . From here , take Maturana into the neighborhood , and do n't miss the Basilica del Salvador and Plaza Brasil on Huerfanos , the Parroquia de Nuestra Senora de la Precio Sangre Church on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Barrio Brazil was an upper-class neighborhood in the 1800s , and many of the mansions from that time remain , while Barrio Yungay feels more typically Latin American ' , with colorful , if slightly crumbling , colonial houses and cobblestone streets . In Barrio Yungay , from Plaza Yungay , walk Libertad three blocks south to Peluqueria Francesa , an old-fashioned barbershop / fabulously decorated eatery . Stop for a coffee ( or breakfast ) here to take in what feels like a time-warp to the 1920s , with walls decorated with memorabilia like movie posters , antique furniture , dolls , and a surprisingly rich collection of barbershop-related paraphernalia . Perhaps more importantly for some , Happy Hour here is actually Happy Day ' ( 10am to 9pm ) and Pisco Sours are only $3 ! <h> 12pm : Museo de la Memoria <p> Before leaving Santiago , a trip to the Museo de la Memoria , Santiago 's Human Rights Museum is an absolute must . <p> From La Peluqeria Francesa , take Compa+ia de Jesus four blocks to the west and turn right on Chacabuco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . Entry is by donation only , so spend an hour learning about Chile 's very dark and recent history under Pinochet 's military dictatorship between 1973 and 1990 . Tens of thousands of innocent citizens disappeared ' , more were brutally tortured and countless starved under this strict dictatorship . Although so many Santigue+os were affected , people today are focused on growth and the future , so this is your best chance at engaging in any dialogue or learning much about the regime in any detail . In line with Santiago 's affinity for incredible architecture , of course , the building itself is an incredible , modern structure conceived by a group of Brazilian architects . <h> 2pm : Quinta Normal Park <p> You 'll no doubt need to relax after the museum , so head right across the street to Quinta Normal park , a large park where you can take a boat ride on the lake , relax with a picnic , watch happy kids splashing in the fountains , or , if you truly are a super tourist , you can visit even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Technology Museum , the Museo Ferroviario ( Railway Museum ) and the Artequ+n Museum are all located within the park 's borders . <h> 3pm : Mercado Central <p> After the park , take the subway ( the station is located right at the park 's entrance ) to Santiago 's Mercado Central , located at the Puente Cal Y Canto Metro Station . The easiest way is to take the red line to Los Heroes , change onto the yellow line here and take it two stops to Puente Cal Y Canto . Mercado Central is clean , bright and packed with fish stalls and quaintly decorated restaurants for some of the freshest fish dishes in the country . If you are into seafood , this is the perfect place for lunch ! <h> 5pm : The Sculpture Park <p> Take the subway #2 from Cal Y Canto two stops to Los Heroes and change onto line #1 to Pedro de Valdivia . Exit and turn north on Concepcion , cross the river again and you 'll be right inside the free Sculpture Park , which has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of its public art collection . Within walking distance of the Gran Torre de Santiago , which is the tallest building in South America , the park has over 30 wood , bronze and steel pieces by popular Chilean artists . <p> If you do n't  care much for art , you can also just sit in the park and enjoy a book or have some ice cream , or , if you are a fan of panoramic views and want to enjoy more of those , from the highest viewpoint in Santiago , head to Sky Costanera , the Observation Deck on top of the Gran Torre de Santiago . Since the skyscraper is the tallest building in Latin America , you 're enjoying vistas from the highest observation deck south of the U.S. here ! Tickets are pretty cheap CLP10,000 ( US$14.75 ) on a regular day , and only CLP7,500 ( US$11 ) on Wednesdays . <h> Where to stay in Santiago <p> Since Santiago is a sprawl of several neighborhoods , and with 5.5 million people the 7th most populous city in Latin America , picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which neighborhood is the most convenient for a few short days of urban exploration ? Which neighborhoods are safe ? Which hotels in Santiago are good ? <p> Luckily , Santiago is a pretty safe city especially compared to other Latin American metropoles and has a fantastic public transportation system . Buses and subways bring you everywhere in no time , and if you prefer getting around by car , you 'll be happy to hear that Uber is operating in Santiago now . <p> As for hotels : The W ( near the Gran Torre skyscraper ) is your best option for a splurge , and several other well known high-end international brands such as Marriott , Sheraton , Crown Plaza , RitzCarlton and Grand Hyatt all have hotels in Santiago . If you do n't  want to spend that much , there are plenty of mid-range hotels that often have great deals ( on my second visit to Santiago I stayed in a swanky apart-hotel with amazing views over the city for only $50 a night ) and of course there are dozens of hostels , if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

And in my opinion , its a place you should visit at least once in your lifetime , no matter if you dislike- crowds or not . Remember that its popular for a reason , hence the high number of tourists.For me , Venice is magical . Some people I meet are more jaded , complain about Venice being too touristy , too crowded , and too expensive . And yes , all of these things are true , and yet , it is a city that does n't compare to any other city in the world , in its beauty , the way it is set up with its canals and surrounded by waters on all sides , its stunning architecture , and the often- aristocratic and elegant , sometimes crumbling and deteriorating buildings.When I was in Milan last fall , I realized that Venice was only 2 hours away on Italys high speed train . I knew I was going to leave Milan on a Monday , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-season ) . And so I booked a train to Venice on a whim I was so close , how could I not go ? It had been years since my last visit , and I was looking forward to a couple of days of simply wandering the streets and taking photos.Im sharing my favorite pictures with you today , plus some fun facts about Venice you might not know , and last but not least : my top five travel tips for Venice . <h> Fun facts about Venice : <p> There are no cars in Venice <p> No cars whatsoever all you hear when you walk the empty streets at night is the clicking sound of high heels.Venice has 170 canals - Instead of streets , Venice is interspersed by canals 170 of them . <p> Over 400 bridges <p> To cross these canals , inhabitants have over 400 bridges connecting the different parts of the island.Venice is made up of 115 little islands <p> To be exact , I should say islands or archipelago instead of island , because Venice is made up by 115 ( give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 200 churches <p> This is an amazing fact considering the compact size of Venice.The city of chimneys <p> The number of churches might not be all that surprising considering Italy is a strictly Catholic country , but did you know that there are 7,000 chimneys in all forms and sizes in Venice ? <p> Almost as many bell towers as churches <p> And then there are the bell towers a whopping 170 of them ! San Marco is the most famous one , and you can enjoy vistas over Venice from the top . Well worth the G8 admission , in my opinion ! San Marco Campanile is a replica <p> Speaking of the famous bell tower : this is actually a replica of the original one ! The first one collapsed in 1902 . The current one was built to look like exactly like the original one . - 18 million visitors per year <p> Venice attracts an insane amount of people every year 15 million ! During the summer , Venice sees 50,000 people in addition to its inhabitants every single day ! Take into consideration that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this number is ! Many of these tourists arrive on cruise ships , and the steadily rising number of cruise ships that dock in the lagoon city are posing many problems for the city.400 gondoliers are offering their services <p> For the 400 gondoliers the visitor numbers are great they never have to worry about losing their job ! except for one female gondolier , who was allowed to join the male gondoliers not all that long ago , in 2010 the world of gondoliering is a mens world . Its one of the hardest to get jobs , by the way : only 3 to 4 new licenses are issued every year . <h> Venice travel tips <p> Use ShareVenice to get from the airport to the city <p> ShareVenice is a shared shuttle service , which groups you with other passengers and thus makes your transfer from the airport to Venice much cheaper . The ticket is G19 , instead of the pricey water taxis which cost anything between- G100 to G160 ( for 4 people with luggage ) from Marco Polo Airport to Venice City Center . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other passengers , but still charge G35 per person booking online with ShareVenice is your cheapest option . The boats are capped at 10 passengers , and the journey takes between 30 and 45 minutes , depending on which dock in Venice you get off at . ShareVenice also offers very affordable tours of the Grand Canal and a glass factory- tour to Murano , by the way.Buy a travelcard- If you want to make the most of your time in Venice , use the- vaporetti ( water buses ) and water taxis . You 'll get the best value for money by buying a travel card ( G18 for 12 hours , - G20 for 24 hours , - G25 for 36 hours , - G30 for 48 hours , - G40 for 72 hours or- G60 for 7 days ) . A single ride is- G7 , so if you 're taking 3 or more trips in a day , its already worth it . The best value for money is the 7 days card . A travel card will allow you to experience Venice from the water for much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and its well worth to tour the canals via boat . Bonus tip : take a golden hour/ sunset ride ! <p> Where to eat <p> Sadly , Venice has the reputation to have some of the worst food in Italy , which makes sense , considering most of the people who work in the city do n't  actually live in Venice but in Mestre on the mainland . So the people who are actually eating in Venice are tourists who probably wont return , so why put a lot of effort into making the food . My main tip : Eat as far away from Piazza San Marco as possible . The closer you get to the piazza , the worse ( and the pricier ! ) the food gets , it seems . On the upside : Pizzeria Antico Forno is so good that it made it on Conde Nast Travelers list of the best ten pizzas in all of Italy ( ! ) , and the recently opened- i Tre Mercanti is an amazing food gallery with all kinds of Italian specialties and wine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal in Venice ? Check Tripadvisor . Scroll through the list of best restaurants in Venice , read through the last few reviews , and mark down the place that sounds best to you in your map . Also : do n't  leave Venice without trying a Spritz , a typical Venetian drink with Campari ( or Aperol ) , Prosecco and sparkling water . If you find a local place , you can get it for as little as- G2 , but even- G4 is still a good price ( if Spritzs are on the menu for- G8 or more , you 're probably sitting in a tourist trap ) . Explore more of the lagoon Venice is amazing , yes , but there are a couple of other islands nearby that are well worth a visit , too , and they are easy to get to from- Venice via water bus . Burano , a little island ( actually four islands , so you still have canals and boats here ) is famous for its colorful pastel houses ; Murano is famous for its glass art but is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a famous ancient church . San Michele Cemetery Island is also a welcome escape from the crowds and has some beautiful tomb stones and graves . <p> Do n't  sit down <p> Well of course you can sit down and take a break ( and you should youll be on your feet a lot ! ) but if you want to sit down in a cafe to sip a cappuccino , be aware that itll cost you a lot of money . Venices cafes are notorious for their overpriced coffees and unexpected surcharges a- G6 surcharge for a live band playing nearby is not uncommon , and with tip and the already pricey drink you can easily end up with a G15 bill for a cup of coffee , so be aware of that . The safest way to make sure you 're not overpaying for a coffee is to drink it like the locals : standing up at the counter . That way , you 'll avoid the service charge and other possible surcharges , and shouldnt pay more than- G2 for a cappuccino or- G1 for an espresso. 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

I 've also noticed the citys slogan City Of Life for the first time on my last visit , and thought that while it was n't very creative , its definitely true Bangkok just feels incredibly alive and buzzing with life at any time of day . And since it 's my last stop in Thailand before my return to Hong Kong , I figured I should give Bangkok a shout-out " I 've been having a great time every time I visited this year ( excluded are visits to the German Embassy ) and have grown to like the city much more than I used to . <p> It 's still not my favorite city in the world , but every time I came here , I enjoyed creature comforts like- watching a movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent coffee ( something I do n't take for granted anymore , after being served instant coffee even in 4* hotels ! ) , paying too much money to satisfy cravings for my favorite- Western food ( or Garretts Popcorn ! ) , - joining the hipster crowd for a Sunday afternoon market stroll or going for a morning run ( admittedly though more often in an air-conditioned hotel gym instead the 100-F / 38-C outdoor temperatures ) .

@@107142897 @2542897/ <h> Polaroid Of The Week : The Stunning Las Lajas Sanctuary , Colombia <p> There are landmarks and monuments that you see a picture of and you just think : Wow ! This place looks amazing ! I want to go there one day. I feel that way every time I see a picture of the pyramids in Egypt , the Taj Mahal , the rice terraces in Bali , but also lesser known places like the Swing at the end of the World ( where I made it to last month ) . And Las Lajas . You might not have heard of Las Lajas , but maybe you 've seen a picture ? <p> The first time I saw a photo of it was many years ago , before I even started my round-the-world trip in 2010 . When my partner and I decided to make our way south from Mexico all the way to Argentina , I put Las Lajas on the itinerary . I did n't  even know where exactly it was , I only knew that it was in Colombia . <p> And then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Europe instead of continuing on to Colombia ( back then , we needed a change of scenery after nine months in Latin America ) . <p> When we returned to Latin America a couple of years later , we started in Argentina and wanted to work our way up to Colombia . We only ever made it to Peru ( and then this happened ) . It was like I was n't supposed to see Las Lajas . <p> But last year , I finally made it to Colombia . I was finally going to visit Las Lajas ! When I mapped out my trip , however , I saw where Las Lajas was located : all the way in the south of Colombia , close to the Ecuadorian border . I 'd only make it there if I was going to Ecuador , which was something I 'd contemplated , but eventually I ran out of time to visit both countries . Was I ever going to see Las Lajas ? <p> Well , the Polaroid already gave it away , I guess . Yes , I finally made it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Southern Colombia to my Ecuador trip , crossing the border overland . The town of Ipiales was my first stop in Colombia , and from there , it is only a short 15-minute drive to Las Lajas . <p> The church is built into a canyon , right over the Gu+itara River , and the name actually refers to the rock that it is built into ( laja is the Spanish word for this kind of sedimentary rock that 's found in this canyon ) . The entrance of the church , built in Gothic Revival style , is reached via a 160 feet ( 50 meters ) high bridge over the river , and the height from the bottom of the canyon to the top of the church is exactly 100 meters ( 330 feet ) . It is a spectacular sight . <p> What makes Las Lajas special for Catholic pilgrims from all over Colombia and beyond is the story of how it came into existence in this rather odd location : In 1754 , a woman and her deaf-mute baby daughter were caught in a storm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter in . Inside the cave , the little girl pointed at a silhouette illuminated by lightning an apparition of the Virgin Mary exclaiming " The woman is calling me ! " . All of a sudden , the girl was able to speak . It is believed that the virgin cured her and caused people to start heading to the site as news about this miracle began to spread across the region . <p> A shrine was built , which eventually was replaced by a larger shrine , which then resulted in the construction of a church in the beginning of the 20th century in that very spot . It took several decades to finish the church that you can visit today . In 1952 , Las Lajas received canonical coronation from the Vatican and it was made a minor basilica in 1994 . In 2007 , Las Lajas was declared on of the Seven Wonders of Colombia . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142898 @2542898/ <p> Between the ornate European architecture and wide , tree-lined avenues , it often felt as if we were in Paris , not in Buenos Aires.2 Ice cream <p> This city is an ice cream lovers paradise . The minimum size is a cone with two big scoops , which is all we ever got , but people everywhere order 1/2 kilo or even a kilo of ice cream ( that is 2.2 pounds of ice cream , for those of you who do n't  do metric ) . The main chains are Freddo and Volta , and we also found this little cafe called Dieci on Avenida Santa Fe that had two heaping scoops for $3 . <p> 3 Street art <p> Because it is not only NOT illegal but also socially acceptable , artists in BA have been able to create an outdoor museum of incredible street art , which we raved about here.4 The dog walkers <p> The Argentine people love their dogs , but living in condos and apartments is tough on their canine friends . A law states that dogs must have plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 or more dogs on a giant , braided leash together at once . Surprisingly , the dogs adjust well and walk proudly together as a pack . Adorable ! <p> 5 Cafe scene of Palermo <p> The independent little coffee shops and cafes that sprawl out onto the sidewalks in Palermo are great for coffee lovers , people watchers , digital nomads and sampling Argentine treats like homemade alfajores . <p> 6 San Telmo Market <p> San Telmos Sunday market was one of the best flea markets we have ever visited . The street performers , buskers and Brazilian drum groups , tango dancers and packed bars along the long street called La Defensa seems more like a big street party than am outdoor walking market.7 The architecture <p> For the first few days before we went on our Free BA tour , we were constantly marveling over how European everything looked . We found out on the tour that ships in the 19th century brought agricultural goods to Europe and rather than return empty , they were weighed down with building materials for the Argentine elite.8 PIZZA ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tango is still very much alive in the city . From the the Sunday market in San Telmo and tourist restaurants of La Boca to local milongas ( tango bars ) , tango is everywhere in BA.10 The accent <p> Never in a million years did we think we 'd fall for the distinct Argentine accent where playa ( beach ) becomes plaisha and yo ( I ) become sho . In fact , when , on the first day we moved in to our Wimdu vacation rental , the porter asked if he could carry my backpack by saying sho la shevo ? I giggled at how funny it sounded and it took a long time to get used to hearing expats speaking the distinct dialect . Cut to six weeks later and it was n't just the accent that was so endearing , but also the rolling Italian rhythm and exaggerated hand gestures to match . <p> 11 The smell of the flower stalls in every streetThere are flower vendors in almost every street in Buenos Aires , and sometimes you can smell them before you even see them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets ( hey , we did n't  say BA was perfect ) . We love that you can just pick up flowers anywhere ! 12 Porte+os working out- <p> What with all the pizza , steak and smoking as if the world were ending tomorrow ( see feeling like the city could fall apart at any moment below ) , you might get the impression that Porte+os are an unhealthy bunch , but its quite the opposite . Gyms are everywhere and all morning ladies walk around with yoga mats under their arms ( I loved BuenaOnda Yoga ) , and popular outdoor workouts include running along Puerto Madero and doing boot camp or other exercises in the park ( that 's me cooling down in the pic below ) .13 The balance of old and new throughout the city <p> San Telmo is filled with antique shops and breezy squares , Palermo Hollywood has restaurants with glass store fronts and celebrity chefs . You can have an all-organic vegan lunch and spend the afternoon in an old school cafe with waiters dressed in black and white carrying big trays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before diets and low-fat butter . Monday to Friday people in suits and ties are glued to their smartphones , but weekends are reserved for taking it slow , with long drawn out asados ( barbecues ) , late nights and lazy days in park . <p> 14 Medialunas ! <p> These flaky , sugary croissants are a popular breakfast dish in Argentina , not only in the capital , but there is just something so special about the deals in every cafe in town for Cafe con Leche ( coffee with milk ) and three medialunas in Buenos Aires . <p> 15 The 9th of July avenue <p> Crossing this monster avenue with a total of 16 lanes takes between two and three traffic light cycles , but we love it for its shops , restaurants , hotels , the iconic obelisk and the grand - opera house , Teatro Colon . <p> 16 Sunsets over Puerto Madero <p> We loved watching the sunset over Puerto Madero , a newly regenerated former port area of the city . <p> 17 Confusing attitude towards protests and strikes <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second day in the city , we were on a city tour , and our guide Ana pointed out several buses escolares ( school buses ) on the side of the road . " Uh oh , " she said almost indifferently , " there 's a protest . " Sure enough , down the road , hundreds of protestors were gathered on the 9th of July Avenue ( none were school children ; protestors just come into the city center on school buses ) . When we asked her why , she said , " Who knows , who cares . " One night , over one million protestors gathered in BA and several hundred thousand in cities around Argentina . We were having pizza not a mile away in a packed restaurant where no one seemed the least bit bothered . How people can so passionately take to the streets yet so casually block out the chants of others is a confusing element of Buenos Aires life . <p> 18 Entrepreneurial- expat community <p> The Argentine capital is overflowing with expats , thanks to very relaxed visa regulations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very in-the-know and fun to hang out with while in town . <p> 19 Romantic local moments <p> The worlds middle and upper classes are so homogenous nowadays , so we loved how , on morning walks , we would often pass men and women in small , local cafes reading their newspapers and drinking coffee as if it were a century ago and everyone was n't in a race against the clock . <p> 20 The parks <p> What a green city ! Like any other major capital city , sprawling cement covers much of Buenos Aires , but there are massive parks all throughout the center , some of which qualify as little forests . We spent many afternoons reading in the green spaces here . <p> 21 The Recoleta neighborhood <p> Parisian style architecture lines this pristine neighborhood , most visitors to the city will pass through here at some point as it is home to the Recoleta cemetery where Evita Perons body is now buried . <p> 22 The feeling that the city could fall apart at any moment- <p> Protestors , chaos , lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation , Buenos Aires feels like a Latin powder keg ready to pop , and although you would think you should be scared of these elements coming to a head , instead the city feels electric , daring , and like you better live it up now before it all falls apart . <p> Spanish and Italian influence is obvious , but there is a large Jewish , Polish , English and Arab influence in the city , too . <p> 25 The attitude toward LGBT rights <p> Argentina was the first South American country to pass full on marriage equality laws , and the LGBT community is completely integrated with very little homophobia in wider society despite being a Latino and heavily Catholic country . <p> 26 The dedication to Mate <p> Mate is a stimulant herbal drink , and the people of BA are addicted to it ! People drink mate in the park , at work , in cafes and we often saw people refilling from their Thermoses right on the street . <p> 27 The cemeteries <p> Massive above-ground mausoleums line what are like mini city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While most tourists visit the Recoleta , mentioned above , hardly anyone makes it out to the much bigger and more beautiful Chacarita cemetery that Dani visited a few days before we left town . <p> 28 The beautiful billboard holders <p> Much like the Metro station signs in Paris , the beautifully ornate green billboard holders in Buenos Aires are just one of those little , even subconscious , details that make BA such a romantic place . <p> 29 El Ateno Grand Splendid Bookstore <p> What was once a grand theater is now the grandest of bookstores , and bibliophiles can devour literature while sipping coffee right on the theaters stage . <p> 30 The incredible amount of veggie restaurants <p> Meat , pizza , meat , meat , pizza . That was all we heard about BA before arriving , but it turns out that the people have a healthy attitude towards meatless meals ! <p> 31 Milka Stores ! <p> Entire stores are dedicated to this popular German chocolate , and after months of bad chocolate choices , Dani was in absolute heaven being able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 32 Public transportation <p> Sure , the buses might not stop all the way before you jump on , and getting change can be difficult at time . The Subte might not run very late and petty theft might be common , but using the citys interactive online map , we were able to get around the city by bus ( 50 cents a ride ) and subway ( $1.25 a ride ) super easily day and night . <p> 33 The cats in the Botanical Gardens <p> Dozens of them all over the place , licking and cuddling all day long . Obviously Danis favorite place in BA , she even chose to spent a part of her birthday afternoon here ! Have you been to Buenos Aires ?

See you ! <p> Hi Leandro , Buenos Aires is indeed very unique there 's no other city like that anywhere in the world ! The dog walkers are also something very rare we 've seen some in New York , some in San Francisco , but never as many as in BA = I do n't  think Ive ever seen any dog walkers in Germany though = <p> I enjoyed your post , i have lived in Buenos Aires for long stretches over the past 5 years , and have visited 10 times , took my tour groups here , etc . <p> The only advice i can give a potential visitor , and mistakes i see a lot of tourists make are : <p> Do n't  get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , but most of the good restaurants are along way away . Its also not as safe at night . Florida street is a tourist trip and not that safe . <p> Many americans come to Buenos Aires and fall in love with Recoleta and Palermo . These are great places , that i very much enjoy , but they are upper class neighborhoods . Middle class Americans see people wearing GAP/Polo/Adidas and think they are in a neighborhood of similar social standing . When in fact these brands are very expensive here . <p> The true heart of the city in Rivadavia , west of Callao . Its the real middle class . To the south things are more dodgy . To the north is wealth , expats and english language menus . <p> I would a number 34 , I could add 50 more , but #34 should be the taxi drivers . Some of the most entertaining moments i spent here were in cabs . Singing along to Virus songs , just last night i got in a cab after a lovely dinner with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after i sat in the cab and began moving , Coldplays Trouble came on = <p> Do n't  be hurt by the posts of others , like many emigrants in time sod turmoil ( the guy from Milan ) they have left under bad circumstances and filled with mixed emotions . they have to justify the decision they made to leave every day , and they usually do that by trashing their former home . The worst are Colombians at doing this . <p> I leave sunday , and each time i go , i tear up when i get on the plane . <p> Thanks so much for all the great info ! Our trip to Buenos Aires will greatly benefit from everything- I mean I read everything ! - that you both shared ! We are renting an apartment in the microcenter and my only question is is that a good location ? Will it be safe ? Keep traveling and writing and taking pictures !

Which street will you be staying in , do you know ? We always felt safe but did n't  flash any valuables ( camera , iPhone , etc ) . Youll have to let us know how you like BA ! ! <p> Back after three weeks ! We ended up couchsurfing = A great experience and took A LOT of your advice and recommendations . It was one of the smoothest trips I 've ever had ! The weather was perfect and we really got to know and enjoy the city as well as Iguaz+ ! And you 're right , it really comes down to being smart and extra prepared ( almost a little paranoid haha ) and you should be fine almost anywhere ! Thanks again for the great information = <p> I absolutely love this post ! ! ! Went to Buenos Aires recently and agree with every point you 've raised especially the street art , the cafe culture , the parks and THE FOOD ! It was a city that captured my heart and I 'd love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend renting a car if you want to be flexible and see a lot of places in a short time . If you only plan to visit a couple of places , Mdina or Marsaxlokk for example , you 'd be fine taking the bus . This is actually a super helpful site about the bus network on Malta : http : //www.maltabybus.com/ The buses are so cheap , but I thought the rental car was a good deal and I did n't  have to depend on the bus schedule , could stop any time I wanted , and fit in more than buses wouldve allowed me to . <p> What a wonderful , extensive roundup of one of our favorite cities ! Just stumbled on this post now via Twitter and looking forward to sharing it with our Buenos Aires study abroad students . The dog walking photos are hilarious . Actually , all of the photos you chose in include really show the vibe and color and culture of the city . Cheers , Steph ( CAPA ) <p> OMG !

Haha , I 've heard several people say that , but I am still drooling when I think about places like El Guerrin . That said I also remember some horrible pizza experiences in Argentina . <p> Thank you for the post Dany I 'm an expat myself , I 'm from BA and live abroad , your post made my heart ache with recuerdos . Have you visited some other parts of the country ? , cant wait for your reviews . <p> Hello Dani , I will be in BA in a few days , my first trip to South America !

I believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thanks so much for putting this together , Dani ! My girlfriend and I are moving to Buenos Aires , so its reassuring to see so many wonderful impressions of the city . In a few of the posts you touch upon the expat community do you have any advice or resources for those of us who are moving to BA semi-permanently ? I 'm hoping to find a non-English teaching job , but have no idea where to start from here in the US ! <p> So happy to hear that ! ! I loved BA so much . The only resource I remember that we used a lot was http : //baexpats.org/ not sure how active their forums still are but back when we were in BA it was an excellent resource .. Hope this helps = Enjoy Buenos Aires , Phoebe . <h> Comment navigation 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142899 @2542899/ <h> Where to stay in Las Vegas , New Mexico : The Historic Plaza Hotel <p> It was love at first sight with the Historic Plaza Hotel , even before we arrived there . As soon as I had decided to include Las Vegas in our New Mexico road trip itinerary , I looked up hotel options for the little town in northern New Mexico , and when the Historic Plaza Hotel popped up in list of hotels , it caught my attention immediately . <p> I felt like the hotel was straight out of the 19th century " what a change to all the Comfort Inns and Econo Lodges that usually showed up in my searches . Staying anywhere else was not even an option ; I had a feeling that the Plaza Hotel would be just the right place to rest our heads during our time in Las Vegas . <p> It turned out that the gorgeous Italianate-style red brick building looked beautiful in pictures , but was even more impressive in reality . It thrones majestically over the historic Park Plaza , now in addition made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus the adjoining Ilfeld Building , both lovingly renovated and well maintained . <p> As soon as you enter the building , the grand entrance hall evokes fantasies about the scenes that must have happened here over one hundred years ago , when the hall must have been filled with wealthy ladies on the way to their cattle farms or horse ranches . Instead of cars , horse carriages would have lined the green central square , and the entourage of the ranch owners would have rushed in and out of the hotel with all the suitcases , boxes and other luggage they were traveling with . <p> Stepping into the hotel almost felt like stepping onto a movie set " with the exception that this place really exists ! The building was constructed in 1882 , when Las Vegas was a booming transportation hub thanks to its strategic location on the newly built East West train line . One hundred years later , the entire building was renovated and modernized , without losing any of the original features or the character of the building . <p> After extending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now houses 66 guest rooms plus 5 suites . Thick , soft carpets absorb the noise of the hurrying steps up and down the stairs , and antique furniture lines the hallways , maintaining the Old West feel of the hotel . <p> While the room is clean and comfortable , it is nothing extraordinary , but the hotel is doing a good job by keeping up the southwestern atmosphere here , too , with wooden furniture and a wash basin in vintage look . The bedside tables are covered in True West cowboy magazine , the matching read for our stay here . The bedroom might feel a little bit antiquated , the bathroom , however , is modernized and shiny . <p> The building itself has n't lost anything of the grand aura it must have emitted when it opened its doors in the late 19th century , with the Victorian dining room still in use , and the adjoining Ilfeld Building offering a ballroom that is often used for weddings and other receptions . <p> The hotel bar , Byron T. 's is designed in Western style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notorious figures that were known to have spent time in Las Vegas would step through the wooden swinging saloon doors at any time " outlaws that included Jesse James , Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid . What I also loved was that the locals use Byron T. 's as their hangout , too " it is not just made for tourists ! <p> The Landmark Grill is the main restaurant though which had a decent selection of New Mexican dishes , all at an affordable price ( ranging from $7 to $27 ) . We even found two different vegetarian dishes on the menu ( including a spinach salad with cranberries and walnuts ) and the Stuffed Green Chile was the best I had had on our road trip thus far . The Landmark Grill is also where breakfast is served in the mornings , included in the room rates . Instead of a typical mediocre road trip motel breakfast buffet , you get to order a full hot breakfast a la carte " both the Berry Waffles and the Huevos Rancheros lived up to our expectations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be no other place for me to stay . The Historic Plaza Hotel adds to the entire Old West experience and with its perfect location right in the center of town , I would n't even consider one of the typical chain hotels " which were n't even cheaper than the Historic Plaza Hotel . <p> Tip:We found an amazing bargain deal for the Historic Plaza Hotel on Booking.com ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Let 's start with the good news : I won the lottery ! No , I did n't  win a million dollars , but I won a green card .. i.e. permanent residency , the right to live in the US . Did you know that you can win green cards ? Chances are that if you are from the US , you are n't  aware of the fact that your country gives away 50,000 immigrant visas through a lottery . Or at least most Americans that I told I won a green card did n't  know that this was possible . And most foreigners Ive met in the past few months who I told about my green card win had heard about it but did n't  think it really existed , they thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the US have an amazing initiative called The Diversity Visa Program , which was introduced in the early 1990s to attract immigrants from countries with low immigrant quotas . You can enter every year ( it takes place in October , running all month ) , and its completely free of charge . The only requirement to qualify for the DV lottery visa ? You must have a high school diploma or its equivalent ; or within five years of applying , at least two years of work experience in an occupation requiring at least two years ' training or experience . Some countries those that sent a total of more than 50,000 immigrants ( those issued green cards ) to the US are n't  eligible to participate , but millions of people from all over the world enter the lottery every year hoping to make their American Dream come true : to emigrate to The Land Of Opportunity.Most of you know that I have been tired of the nomadic life for a while now , and that I have been spending most of my time in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent residency , making it impossible for me to get a lease in my name , to get a bank account , a phone plan , a job . The only way for me to get permanent residency ? Get married . Or win the green card lottery . And guess what . In 1016 , I finally won , after years of trying my luck . I would finally be able to make my American dream come true . <p> Fast forward nine months to today , when after months of being screened and vetted , after months of waiting , fearing , hoping , I 've finally got the permanent residency visa in my passport . I am officially an immigrant . In light of the recent political events with regards to immigration in the US , you can imagine that my dream , which I was wishing for years to come true , has taken an interesting turn . Trumps America does n't  necessarily feel like a welcoming space for immigrants at the moment , no matter if Muslim or non-Muslim , I do n't  think there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from another , potentially broader immigration ban . Am I , as an LGBT immigrant , safe in the US , now that several outspoken homophobes are in power ? Do I have to worry about moving to a country that is going through a lot of changes that I could n't have foreseen when I entered the lottery and started the vetting process , changes that do n't  support my beliefs.Of course I wont nix my longstanding plans to settle in the US because of these recent events , but you can imagine that I 've found myself in an emotional turmoil ever since I received my passport and my immigration documents from the US consulate . Concerns and worries about the future that I 've never felt like this before have been keeping me up at night , have been consuming my thoughts most of the month . I will write about the whole process of entering the lottery , winning and emigrating to America when I 'm finally settled granted I 'm being allowed to enter the US . <p> I am going to leave it at this for now , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering the US at the moment are being thoroughly questioned on their views about the current president and social media channels and other online profiles are checked . <h> Where I 've been <p> January was my first proper month of winter in a long time luckily I got to escape the cold for ten days , because I 'm still not a big fan of snow or arctic weather . I spent 2/3 of the month in chilly Germany and 1/3 in Israel , where one of my favorite people in the world recently relocated to . The perfect excuse to head to Israel for the third time ! While my travels in Germany were limited to my life changing trip to Frankfurt as well as a couple of trips to Leipzig , where my brother lives , and a couple of pit stops in Berlin , my itinerary in Israel was packed ! I started my trip with a day trip to a stalactite cave in the mountains surrounding Jerusalem , and went north from there to visit the two artist colonies Rosh Pinna and Tsfad . While we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional Shabbat dinner with my friends family . A couple of rainy days forced us to cancel some of our plans , but we still managed to visit the Roman ruins of Caesaria before heading to Jerusalem where I visited the Old City and the Western Wall for the third time I love this place and think I have to finally write about it . I 've never said much about Jerusalem but it is such a unique , historically and religiously significant city with a special aura . I then got to return to the desert and the Dead Sea a day later than planned , because of a rained out half-marathon , but more on that below . We spent the last couple of days in Tel Aviv , another third visit after falling in love with the city in 2014 and returning for a quick getaway in 2015 . All in all , it was an amazing trip and I am glad that I was able to fit it in before my return to the other side of the world ( more on that in What 's next ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month : <h> Highlights <p> Quality time with family and friends <p> When I got the notification that I had to come to Germany in the winter to finish my green card vetting process , I was everything but happy . I was supposed to be in Asia now , enjoying the tropical heat of Thailand or Vietnam . Instead , I was snowed in most of January . However , I realized two things this month : I am dealing with winter much better than I thought I would , and I am dealing with winter much better than most of my friends who have to go through this every year . I was able to skip most winters since 2010 , or at least escape for a few months . However , I seemed to be the only one who did n't  let the weather stop me from daily runs ( yes , that 's my hair FROZEN after a 12k run in the picture below ) , from being out and about , and NOT being cold all month ( thanks to my new winter coat , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great thing about being stuck in Germany while waiting to get my passport back ? Catching up with old friends and spending quality time with my family . Now that the green card will allow me to settle more permanently , I will probably not be able to take any extended trips to Germany anymore , unlike in the past few years , when I 've seen my nephew and nieces twice a year and always spent at least a month in my home country . I treasured every moment I had with my siblings and the kids , and am grateful that my location independent lifestyle has allowed me to be such a big part of their lives . <p> A spa day at the Dead Sea <p> The Dead Sea is one of the most fascinating places I 've ever visited not only the lowest point on earth , but also one of the saltiest bodies of water . Ill never forget the strange feeling of floating in the salty water for the first time in 2014 . The desert scenery surrounding the Dead Sea , albeit being barren and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found out about a marathon along the Dead Sea , I thought to myself : running a race here would be so special ! And when it just so happened that my trip to Israel aligned with the 2017 race date of the Ein Gedi Desert race along the Dead Sea , I did n't  have to think long . Sign me up , please ! This was supposed to be the highlight of my trip sadly it turned out to be a lowlight , see below but nonetheless we went ahead with the spa day that we had planned post-race in one of the spa hotels on the shores of the Dead Sea , which is famous for its minerals and salts ( of course ) . I did n't  think itd be warm enough to float in the water at this time of year , but I took a chilly dip and it felt just as bizarre as it did the first time around . Unforgettable ! <h> Lowlights <p> A rained-out half marathon <p> As I said above this was supposed to be the highlight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ein Gedi half marathon . Right upon arrival in Israel I was told that a big storm was moving towards Israel and that the race might be canceled . And sure enough , a couple of days before race day , the dreaded email arrived in my inbox : the Ein Gedi Run 2017 had to be canceled for fears of heavy rains and subsequent flash floodings this was not only the desert after all , but the lowest point on the planet . And sure enough , the photos that I later saw of the road I was supposed to run on looked horrific . I cant believe how quickly the storm passed we had our Dead Sea spa day a day later and the weather couldnt have been better . I was also bummed out that I had trained so hard all month for nothing , braving the snow and icy temperatures , but in hindsight I can honestly say that I would n't have gone running this month had n't  it been for this race which I needed to train for . And it changed my mind about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wuss to do it , but now I know I can do it and I was n't even miserable . <p> Anxiety <p> I 've already touched on this briefly above : This month Ive experienced anxiety for the first time ever . After Inauguration Day , I started having this tense feeling in my chest , which has n't  left since . I cried when the news of the green card holders ban broke . I 've simply been feeling deflated by the current situation in the US , and had not pictured my move there to take place under the current circumstances . <h> Other happenings <p> 20,000 Instagram Followers <p> For most digital influencers , 20k followers is a small number , but I have been working hard to reach this major milestone : reaching 20k followers on Instagram , my absolute favorite social media channel ( looking at pretty pictures helps me take my mind off political stuff , work-related stress and distastrous news ) . Since most brands do n't  even work with influencers who have less than 20k followers , this was also a big step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The year of challenging myself <p> After a quite boozy December , I made an on-the-whim decision to quit alcohol for all of January . I usually do n't  drink much , but I noticed that in December , I drank nearly every day . In Berlin , my friend and I went to cocktail bars and drank mulled wine at the Christmas markets every day , I went on a wine-themed trip to Sonoma County , I spent a weekend craft beer tasting in L.A. So I decided it was time for an alcohol cleanse , which I 'd never done before but which turned out surprisingly easy . There were a couple of awkward social situations , but I generally avoided them by meeting people for breakfast or over coffee instead . Of course I felt I needed a drink on Inauguration Day , not gon na lie = <p> Since this challenge was fairly easy , I decided to continue to challenge myself this year , mainly giving up my main vices for a month each , but also to do a few things I would n't usually do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily runs , maybe even 30 days of yoga ) . And next month , I am really challenging myself : February is the month of no coffee . Which happens to be my biggest and most beloved vice so well see how that goes . <p> Enjoying a coffee while I still can .. <p> New haircut <p> It had been nearly a year since my last visit to a hairdresser ( last February in Santa Marta , Colombia ) but my reader Sarah already told me a few months ago that it was time for a new haircut . Sarah , this ones for you : I finally went to the hair dresser ( of course I only ever looked like in the picture right after he blow dried my hair . ) <p> The invite to speak at Womens Travel Fest <p> I always want to take my business to the next level , add new skills to my portfolio , challenge myself to things I have n't done yet . One of these things is public speaking . I had to drop out of a panel at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ havent pursued any other public speaking gigs since , but I 've been asked to speak at the Womens Travel Fest in New Orleans next month which is n't only a huge honor but also the perfect fit for me .

Maybe see you there ? I have to admit that at the time of writing this I 'm not 100% sure if I can attend since I will be in South America then ( see below : What 's next for me ) , but I 'm trying everything I can to join the inspiring and impressive range of speakers and panelists ( check them out here ) . It is a great opportunity to connect with like-minded female travelers , to learn about female solo travel , get inspired for your next trip , maybe even a long-term adventure by yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me know I love meeting readers ! ) <p> Connect with me on Pepo ! <p> This month , I 've joined Pepo , a new chat app that connects you with people who share your passions . I created a Globetrottergirls chat ( boys are welcome to join , too = ) in which I talk travel , share travel tips and answer your question . You can also start a private chat with me on Pepo , but I 'd love to see you in my public chat and have you join the conversation . By the way Pepo is not just for travelers , there are chats for all kinds of passions : food , street art , LGBT chats , and more . <h> What 's next for me : Upcoming Travels <p> Ill return to Germany for a few short days at the beginning of February , but just long enough to pack up my stuff before heading to New York City . I wont be spending much time there either , just long enough to celebrate my new immigrant status , because South America is calling ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South America that I have n't made it to yet ( other than Venezuela , Guyana , Suriname and French-Guiana ) but which I 've been intrigued by for a long time . In fact , it was a close tie last winter between Colombia and Ecuador , and after lots of hemming and hawing I chose Colombia , which turned out to be an epic adventure . I hope that Ecuador will be equally as enthralling , and I 'm off to a good start : I will be visiting the Gal+pagos Islands , a dream trip for me ! I cant tell you how excited I am to tick these fascinating Islands off of my bucket list . I will be cruising around the islands with Galapagos Luxury Charters , which is something beyond my wildest dreams .

@@107142902 @2542902/ <h> Housesitting in New York , a dream come true <p> The fresh , crisp air buzzed with- the kind of excitement only those first few summer days can bring . This is what drew Dani and I out onto the Brooklyn Promenade that afternoon . Working away in our Brooklyn Heights condo , where we had been housesitting for nearly two months , the sounds of summer teased us through the open window . <p> Once we decided to take a break , it was easy to speed down the stairs and run two blocks to sit on a bench and take in the cyclists and skateboarders , couples kissing and kids balancing ice scoops on sugar cones while running in circles around tired tourists who just finished their obligatory trek over the Brooklyn Bridge in order to snap pictures of the Manhattan skyline just across the water . <p> Had we just been in town on a quick holiday , we most likely would have joined those tourists , Dani would have worked on getting good skyline shots and then maybe we would have had dinner somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Times Square . This time around , though , we were not tourists . <p> We were New Yorkers , albeit temporarily , and housesitting for two months , we were able to develop a routine , habits , in fact a full life in the city. - For an hour we let the strong sun singe our skin as we sat lazily on a bench with that relaxed feeling you can only have when you 're just a few blocks from home and do n't  need a thing . <p> Enjoying the fresh produce from the Union Square Farmers Market <p> Instead of descending upon wicker tables in a hotel lobby and eating half-frozen cantaloupe slices and toast for breakfast , I woke up everyday at 7am to feed our two adorable pet cats , meowing so loudly youd think we had n't  fed them and spoiled them with cuddles and treats the day before . Then I fed the fish and re-joined Dani ( who slept through feeding time ) in our king size bed , and fell back asleep to the sound of rough cat tongues licking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we woke up , made scrambled eggs or yogurt and granola and cups of ridiculously strong coffee and got to work . As simple as eggs and granola are , I am seriously considering a personal chef , even if its just for a day . The mornings were filled with writing , phone calls , interviews , podcast or video editing the multi-faceted mountains of work bloggers chip away at just to keep plates spinning every day . <p> Brownstones in our neighborhood in Brooklyn <p> As morning dissipated into the long afternoon stretch , we would inevitably become anxious to get out and explore before returning to feed the cats in the early evening and heading back out for dinner or meet-ups with friends . That 's the thing about actually living in New York there is never a shortage of interesting people to meet , including friends from the online world and friends of friends who turned into great friends of our own . <p> When we werent out exploring the five boroughs , or meeting people for coffee , ice cream , dinner or drinks , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the futon and ordering in any type of international cuisine using the Seamless food delivery app . <p> We loved the glorious spring days in New York <p> In the two months we housesat in Brooklyn , we hung out in hipsterville known as Williamsburg , walked home to upscale Brooklyn Heights from up-and-coming Red Hook , crossed the Brooklyn Bridge several times with visiting friends , walked the length of Broadway in Manhattan , went to Queens , the Brooklyn Navy Yard , Governors Island and Roosevelt Island , walked through Prospect Park and Central Park , Cobble Hill and the East Village , Chelsea and downtown Brooklyn , we hit flea markets , farmers markets , ate from food trucks and at trendy brunch locations . <p> But it was the soft , easy details of actually living in New York that filled us with joy . Dani went running over the Brooklyn Bridge once or twice a week , we loved jumping out to sit on the Brooklyn Promenade or watching in awe as teenagers sang doo-wap on the C Train back home at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cafe around the corner from our house . <p> New and old friends in NYC <p> These moments probably shine even brighter for us because we were able to do this all without paying a single cent in rent . Cuddling and feeding their cats and giving the condo a few good scrubs was all that was required for us to live out an absolute dream . We estimate that we saved between $5000-$7000 in rental costs over those weeks , which meant we could drop extra cash on concert tickets or see a Broadway show . In fact one of our absolute highlights was seeing the best piece of ( interactive ) theater we have ever seen , - Sleep No More at the McKittrick hotel , which we may not have done if we were already spending $150 a night on a hotel room or vacation rental in New York . <p> More than anything , spending the spring and start of summer in New York gave us a massive gift , one we have been looking for since we started traveling all those years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could actually call home . Even if we never settle down there ( or anywhere , for all we know ) , our love of New York is now so ingrained in our hearts that we know we want to create a lifestyle that involves a month or more here , every year , at least . <h> Interested in housesitting in New York ? <p> At first , a housesit in New York was like finding a needle in a haystack , but ever since our first NYC Housesit , we have come across several sits in the Big Apple this summer - especially TrustedHousesitters is noteworthy here , where in recent months several amazing gigs have popped up for New York City . <p> Our discount offer with TrustedHousesitters.com <p> If you 're not signed up with TrustedHousesitters yet , - you can sign up via this link and get 20 % off your membership fee ! 129336 @qwx989336 <p> What a great experience .

We were incredibly lucky that we got to live this dream ! You should start housesitting , too = <p> It sure is ! In some neighborhoods , at least . There were quite a few times when we found ourselves in a neighborhood where we thought to ourselves this does n't  feel like New York at all ! but without our housesit , we wouldve never had the chance to find these gems = <p> Were you featured on a radio show recently and you said you do not charge for house keeping , you could never do that because of the savings , even if they handed you an envelope or something like that . Are you the those girls ? <p> Yes , that might have been us = Did you hear us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not charge for housesitting , but its quite different from housekeeping = We feel that getting a free place to stay is payment enough in return for looking after the house and/or pets . <p> Hi , I 'm getting a work visa with my college to go to New York for this summer and your blog post just made me super excited for it haha ! It sounds so wonderful ! ! I 'm just wondering how did you go about becoming a house sitter ? = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142903 @2542903/ <h> Soaking up the desert spirit in San Pedro De Atacama <p> At first glance , San Pedro feels like it 's straight out of an old time Western film , set somewhere in the Southwestern US . The white one-story Spanish colonial adobe buildings are mud-splashed from the deep red dusty roads . You might see cowboys on horses or sheep or goat herders , or first you might hear their hooved friends pounding the unpaved roads on a walk outside of town . <p> Between the altitude ( 7,900 feet / 2,400m ) and the scorching sun and freezing nights , those walks can be a challenge . Much like our hikes in Tucson during the day , we were often left breathless , conversations ending not because they were finished , but from catching our breath or stopping to drink water here in this seriously dry desert . <p> That 's where any comparisons come to an end , however , because San Pedro really ca n't compare to any place in the world , not even to another location in Chile . Somehow this tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote border village and adventure capital of the Atacama Desert . <p> This village of 5,000 can certainly keep you entertained for a day or two , but the incredible Atacama Desert surrounding it is what attracts visitors- from around the world to come here . <p> We 've already told you about the otherworldly landscapes of the Atacama Desert , and we 'll talk about the things you should n't miss on a visit to San Pedro next week , but here are just some of the places that make San Pedro de Atacama an outstanding place to visit : <p> The third largest geyser field in the world ( El Tatio Geysers ) <p> The third largest salt flats in the world ( Salar de Atacama ) <p> The lunar landscapes of the Moon Valley and Death Valley <p> The Deep blue altiplano lagoons like the Laguna Miscanti , Mi+iques and Chaxa <p> The Laguna Cejar that is so salty that you can float in it like in the Dead Sea <p> The- two faces carved in rock walls ( Pukara de Quito ) <p> Milky Way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top activities in San Pedro <p> You can easily spend a week here and not see everything the Atacama Desert has to offer , but truth be told , the tours are very extreme affairs due to long drives , early starts , freezing temperatures , boiling temperatures , the altitude or the intensity of the landscape around you . So you 'll need to plan in a few rest days in between all the tours " and San Pedro is the perfect charming base to do just that . Although it might seem odd , there is just something that drew us to this northern town so much so that we named it our favorite place in all of Chile . <p> The main road in town , Caracoles , is lined with restaurants and tour agencies " and while it could feel overly touristy , the quaint Spanish-colonial buildings make the whole setting just picture-perfect . Neither of us will ever forget that first dinner in town in a candle-lit adobe restaurant with live guitar on a dimly lit stage- it was very intimate and romantic . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so great , either . We love rustic feeling inside most of them , with adobe benches and bars built right into rock surfaces and how they keep fires lit at night for guests to stay cozy and warm . <p> During the day , most visitors are out on tours or tucked away in their hotels , but at night the town seems to come alive . Caracoles swarms with people shuffling back and forth looking at the menus , deciding which restaurant to dine at that evening . Restaurants all tend to have a lunch menu with a starter , a main and dessert or coffee , while dinners often include at least one special dish that changes every night . <p> Even though its location is remote and activities here tend toward the adventurous , San Pedro is not a backpacker ' destination . There are a few cheapie places and little tiendas ' that sell basics for cooking in a kitchen , but while you 're here , we say splurge on the higher-end restaurants for truly delicious dining experiences . <h> What to do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow pace and almost sleepy feel . Head one block off Caracoles and you 're strolling along the tree-lined , shady and serene Plaza de Armas , where you can have coffee and people watch on the square . We , of course , spent time with the stray dogs sunbathing here , too . <p> At the square 's northwestern corner sits the gorgeous white church , Iglesia San Pedro , which dates back to 1640 and is the second oldest church in all of Chile . The bright white color of the simple fa+ade sets a beautiful contrast to the cloudless , bright blue sky , but it is the inside that makes this church truly special : the walls , roof , and the entrance door are built with cactus wood and bound together with llama leather " no nails were used here ! <p> From outside of the church and just about anywhere in San Pedro , you can see volcano Licanc+bur , the high volcano on the east side of town , looming over the village at 19,409 feet / 5916 meters . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape , but is a snow-capped summit in winter . If you need to orientate yourself , east is where the volcano is . <p> Within a five to ten minute walk away from Caracoles you will be surrounded by local houses made of mud-brick with clay and hay roofs . Even though these days most of San Pedro 's inhabitants live off tourism , there is still a fair number of people who still do what the Atacame+os have done for thousands of years " farming and livestock breeding . This is so much of San Pedro 's charm " llamas , goats , sheep , and their cowboys bustle along the unpaved roads here every day.The reddish dusty roads are actually watered every morning by truck in order to keep it packed down , but with only 1.4 inches / 35mm of rain per year , it seems unsustainable to wet down the roads , provide the water necessary for locals and keep up with the tourism boom happening here in town . <p> When you really take a good look around , it is easy to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places that change completely within a decade or so , considering the fast development of new resorts and tour agencies , but we hope that the village will be able to retain its laid-back Wild West charm no matter how much our favorite Chilean town grows ! <h> Where to eat in San Pedro de Atacama <p> Adobe ( Caracoles 211 ) : Delicious food , great coffee and excellent Wi-Fi . Come for lunch , when they have set menus ( starter , main , desert or coffee , and sometimes a free pisco/drink ) that are very good value for money . <p> La Estaka ( Caracoles 259 ) : Fabulous set lunch menus for CLP7,000 . We never had a bad meal here . Overpriced at night though , when a main dish costs more than the entire set lunch . <p> Quitor ( Licancabur #154 ) : Excellent three course meals for CLP6000 with a good vegetarian option . One of the most creative and scrumptious meals we had in San Pedro . <p> Market : If you 're on a budget or just looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a courtyard off Caracoles ( between Toconao and Ignacio Carrera Pinto ) twice a week ( Tuesday and Friday ) where you can buy fresh fruit and vegetables and eggs . Along with the tiendas around town , you can find enough groceries to cook for yourself if your hostel has a kitchen . <p> The cheapest options for budget travelers start at $20 for a dorm bed ( yes , San Pedro is not cheap ! ) " there are several hostels right in the center of town . For a private double room , expect to pay around $40 " $50 at a hostel . Hostal La Florida on Tocopilla 406 just off Caracoles has clean double rooms , free use of kitchen , good Wi-Fi , shared bathrooms and a courtyard with hammocks for $40 . <h> What to do in the Atacama Desert <p> Stay tuned for our next post on what we think you should n't miss on your next visit to the Atacama Desert . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> I loved San Pedro . Its so quaint and , as you say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had was that I 'd crossed over from Bolivia and suddenly went from paying a few dollars a night for a private room to five times as much for a cramped dorm . And I had to start being picky with the tours I chose to do . I went to the geysers and the lagoons , and I did the sand boarding too . Even after getting up at 3am for the geyser tour and almost catching frostbite in my fingers , I 'd say that everything was worth it ! <p> Ari yes , we totally agree with your point about being picky about the tours . We actually covered the things you can do around San Pedro and the tours we went on in more detail here . The cold near the geysers in the morning was insane ! ! We did n't  have any clothes for weather like that , not even gloves , we were freezing , too = <p> This brought up so many memories ! = I loved the areas around San Pedro : the Atacama Desert has some of the most extreme landscapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geysers are .

So I decided to share my first impressions , a few fun facts and random trivia about Malta with you before talking about my trip in more detail . <p> At first sight , Malta seems like a magical fairytale island : tiny villages dotted on hilltops across the countryside , little bays with water in such dark shades of blue that they are almost too perfect , and medieval towns so well preserved that it feels like you 're stepping back in time when you set foot in them . <p> Nowadays , there is another side to Malta too : stretches of the coast that have been built up with modern apartment complexes and hotels , even a party mile that could rival the notorious party towns along the Spanish coast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I loved about Malta was that it can be exactly what you want it to be . Looking for history and culture ? You can use Valletta as your base and tour UNESCO World Heritage Sites , ancient temples and medieval forts . You want beaches and relaxation ? Stay in Sliema or St Julian 's and enjoy the ocean , take a sailing trip to the Blue Grotto or the Blue Lagoon . You want culinary revelations and shopping ? There are loads of great restaurants and shopping facilities to keep you busy for at least a week ! <p> Valletta seen from the sea <p> The country is actually an archipelago , made up of Malta , the main island , and the two smaller islands of Gozo and Comino ( plus a few smaller , uninhabited islands ) . In total , just under 400,000 people live in Malta " nearly 370,000 of those live on the main island , about 30,000 live on Gozo and just a handful live on Comino . This makes Malta one of the smallest countries in the world by population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marsaxlokk <p> Malta is so small that you can walk the island in its entirety- ( 27km long and- 14.5km wide ) . Gozo is about half this size ( 14km long and 7km wide ) . It took us less than 40 minutes to cross the island from south to north by car , starting in Marsaxlokk in the south and finishing in Mellieha Bay in the north of the island . By area , Malta is the 207th smallest country in the world ! <p> The archipelago is located in the heart of the Mediterranean , south of Italy , north of Libya and east of Tunisia . <p> Malta is home to nine UNESCO World Heritage listed sites " an impressive number for such a small country ! Three sites are declared UNESCO World Heritage : the historic city of Valletta , the underground temple Hal Saflieni Hypogeum , and the Megalithic Temples of Malta . Six more sites are currently nominated to be World Heritage sites : Mdina , the Grand Harbor , the Victoria Lines and the Great Fault ( a line of fortifications flanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coastal Cliffs , and Dwejra ( the Azure Window ) as well as the Cittadella on Gozo . <p> Valletta , the capital , is one of Malta 's UNESCO sites , thanks to its many historic churches , palaces , the unique wooden balconies ( painted in bright colors ) , and the maze of narrow lanes . <p> Malta is so close to Sicily ( Italy ) that you can see it on clear days , and you can even take catamaran day trips there " it is 90km ( 60miles ) from Malta , and takes about two hours to get there . <p> There are no forests , lakes or rivers in Malta . Instead , the islands are made up of rolling hills and terraced fields . <p> The Maltese cross was introduced to Malta by the Knights of St. John when they took possession of the islands in 1530 , and is depicted on many items around the country including Maltese Euro coins ( the Euro was introduced as the official currency here in 2008 ) , and even door knobs ! <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St Johns Co-cathedral and a door knocker <p> Ftira is the Maltese answer to pizza " a flat-bread with a hole in the middle , topped with Mediterranean vegetables like tomatoes , eggplant and olives ( and sometimes anchovies ) . <p> Ftira : Maltese flat bread <p> Malta , predominantly Roman Catholic , has over 360 churches ! Considering the small size of the nation " Malta is just about twice as big as Washington D.C. " this is quite a large number . <p> The Blue Lagoon off the coast of Comino is one of the most breathtaking bays in all of the Mediterranean . <p> The Blue Lagoon from the ferry <p> Maltese coffee culture is very similar to Italian coffee culture : there are lots of little coffee bars where people have a small cup of coffee right at the counter , usually espresso . Coffee prices are still very low in most places . <p> Not only the coffee culture , but also the architecture feels reminiscent of Italian towns : <p> The Rotunda Of Mosta is the fourth largest unsupported dome in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter of 37.2 meters ( 122- ft ) . The church is also known for the Miracle of Mosta : In 1942 , during an afternoon air-raid by the German Luftwaffe , a 200- kg bomb pierced the dome and landed in a congregation of 300 people who were waiting for mass . The bomb did NOT detonate a miracle ! <p> The Rotunda of Mosta : Place of the Mosta Bomb Miracle <p> Malta is a diver 's paradise and it is named as one of the best diving spots in the world on a regular basis . No wonder with clear water like this : <p> One of the most famous diving spots is the Blue Hole near Gozo , right by the Azure Window , a spectacular limestone rock formation ( and also a popular diving spot ) . <p> The islands are a cat lovers dream ! There are plenty of cats everywhere , and all are well taken care of . <p> Malta produces wine and there are several vineyards on Gozo and Malta . The islands take pride in their local wines and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm that Maltese wines are delicious . <p> Malta has been used as a backdrop for quite a few Hollywood Blockbusters ( without getting credit for it ! ) , including Troy , Captain Phillips , and World War Z , and the popular TV series Game Of Thrones . <p> Mdina was used as Kings Landing in the first season of Game Of Thrones <p> Valletta is one of the smallest capitals in Europe , with a population of just over 6,000 ! It 's actually one of the smaller cities on the island . <p> Merchant Street , one of Vallettas main shopping streets <p> tal-Fenek is the national Maltese dish : rabbit ! Rabbit can be found in almost any dish : Pasta in rabbit sauce , rabbit pie , or rabbit meat stew . <p> tal-Fernek : Rabbit , the Maltese national dish . Not suitable for vegetarians like me , but apparently it is very tasty . <p> In Malta , the boats have eyes . Even though the islands are just as developed as any other European country , the traditional and adorable fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coastal villages and are still used for fishing on a daily basis . They are painted in flashy colors like yellow , red or blue and all have eyes which are supposed to keep bad luck and the evil of the sea away . <p> Luzzu : Traditional Maltese fishing boats <p> One of Caravaggio 's masterpieces , the Beheading of St John , can be seen in St John 's Cathedral in Valletta . The church itself is famous for its striking inside and is well worth a visit . <p> St Johns Co-cathedral with frescos by Mattia Preti it took him years to paint them ! <p> Kannoli ( pastries stuffed with sweet ricotta ) , known as a popular South Italian dessert , are a typical afternoon snack in Malta , too . <p> Another local specialty are pastizzi , flaky dough pasties filled with ricotta cheese or peas ( similar to a British pie ) . They are a popular breakfast dish and in addition to bakeries , there are pastizzerias , which focus on these delicious little pasties . <p> Malta is home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic capital of the country is on the tentative UNESCO World Heritage list . <p> The Maltese love ornate iron door knockers ( and so do I ! ) : <p> Maltese door knockers <p> English and Maltese are both official languages in Malta . I was surprised that many people are n't fluent in English , despite it being the official language . <p> The impressive harbor of Valletta is one of the most significant natural deep-sea harbors in the world . <p> This post was brought to you as a result of the Blog Island Malta campaign , created and managed by iambassador in partnership with the Malta Tourism Authority and the support of Air Malta .

The George Cross was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented on our flag . The Maltese Cross is the eight pointed cross associated with the Knights of St. John . Secondly , the official language in Malta is Maltese and not English , even though many are fluent in English . Thanks and looking forward to more posts . <p> Hi Audrey , Both Maltese and English are our official languages = Only some older people are not very fluent in both ( although most of them understand English , but not speak/ write in it ) . Well done on the post , I really liked it ! ! ! ! <p> I am glad to see such a post highlighting so many lovely sites in my country Malta . Just a small correction though , Maltese is the official national language of Malta . English is the second official language . <p> Oliver- thank you ! I am still thinking about ftira ! ! Ill definitely try to make it at home , but not sure how tasty itll turn out when you do n't  have a wood-fired oven . If its good , I 'll forward you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malta was such a beautiful place ! Some of the foods and pastries sound quite intriguing too ! Ive been seeing a few blog posts about Malta that have given me a totally different perspective on it might have to start seriously looking at going ! <p> great promo for malta its the jewel of Europe as far as i 'm concerned but sorry to hear u had trouble with people speaking English .. I have never had that experience with people from old to young most can and do . and the cross u pictured is the most deserved honour ever earned by a nation for their bravery during WW2 from the uk and I think most of Europe would have agreed . but hey big thumbs up for loving and promoting this beautiful island <p> Hi Rob , thanks for your comment ! I did n't  have trouble understanding people , I was just surprised that almost nobody spoke English without an accent = That was just a random observation though , nothing I 'd complain about ! <p> Dany you captured perfectly the essence of this most magnificent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family many years ago , but even before I had gotten off the plane , I was enamoured by the islands , having seen from the window the walls of Mdina . I could n't wait to get up there and view the whole island , which you can . Amazing island , amazing food , the rabbit stew is unbelievable , above all though are the people of Malta , nothing is too much , they make the island what it is , they are without doubt the most genuine , friendly and amazing people I 've ever encountered anywhere on this planet . Great travelogue cant wait for more . Thanks Dany great writing x <p> Thanks , Stephen ! I can totally understand that you were enamored by Malta just having seen the walls of Mdina ! ! Look out for my next post on Malta tomorrow lots of photos of this magical walled city ! ! <p> Just loved your introduction to Malta , I am Australian but I was born in Malta , and have been back for 2 visits and will be going again this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shown us is just wonderful , it may be small but has so much to give to the tourist industry , full of history and the fact the people are so friendly and helpful is another special part of it .

One of the most charming places I have visited so far I also love how well-connected it is to the rest of Europe .. so easy to get there ! <p> Dear all , all the posts above are very interesting but anyone who visits Malta is impressed by something which can not be described by photos or by words . Our hospitality is by far what brings people to Malta , we transmit positive and welcoming energy and go out of our way to make anyone feel at home .

I 'd love to stay in a family-run agriturismo next time I visit = <p> We are also going back to Malta in June this year , my husband is born in Australia , but just loves visiting Malta , it is great that it is a English speaking country , makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have been catching up on my second language , and did remember quite a few words when I met my relatives back in Malta . And the people are so friendly , our cousins even met us at the airport on our first visit , and we had n't  even met them , they have all had us over for a meal and drinks and great conversations , it was great , looking forward to seeing them once again . So please come and visit Malta especially if it is your first visit you will be pleasantly supprised . <p> This is really helpful for all tourists like me who are looking for places to visit . This article is so informative and I think it contains all questions I have in my mind . By the way you describe this place it sounds so interesting . Thank you for sharing your thoughts about the place ! <p> Hello Adrian , Just saw your comment , if you are looking where to stay in Malta , visit our website , http : **28;88;TOOLONG , it is a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine &amp; beautiful ! <p> Amazing article ! And I am really proud of calling myself Maltese . However , here are even more suggestions : <p> Culture and Events . Especially in summer . In summer , every city and village celebrate their patrons feast with fireworks ( ground and air ) , decorations , banda ( traditional Maltese brass bands ) , marc ( mass chanting towards the patron ) and of course the statue of the patron . ( For the best fireworks one should visit southern villages like Mqabba , Zurrieq , Haz-Zebbug and Qormi ) Other events include carnival in February which is quite traditional and different than other carnivals . Also , an increasingly common occurrence is that every village is now having a non-religious feast . Some popular examples include : Medieval Mdina , Birgu by Candlelight , Notte Bianca in Valletta , and Strawberry Feast in Mgarr . Three major ( and really worth going to ) winefestivals happen in around September-October ( 2 in Valletta and one in Qormi ) 29th June Imnarja celebrated at Buskett with Maltese food and Ghana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known for its fireworks . The International Air Fireworks Festival is usually organized in late April May . In this festival Maltese firework societies compete amongst themselves , as well international ones for first place . This is a free and quite eyecandy event . Ground Fireworks Festival Happens in late April-May . Ground fireworks is quite unique to Maltese culture . Good Friday Religious processions which are organized in a handful ( around 10 ) towns around Malta and Gozo . <p> Nature : The Gozo Dwejra Window and nearby inlet sea ( depicted in one of your pictures ) The Blue Grotto ( Cave near Zurrieq where the water looks crystal blue ) . Dingli Cliffs west side of the island , overlooking Filfla . Nice area for a jog . Buskett Semi-natural small " forest " . Nice place for relaxation . This was the hunting ground for the St. Johns Cavalliers Order . Blue Grotto Amazing beach in Comino with crystal clear blue water . Ghajn Tuffieha and Golden Bay ( Near Mgarr Malta ) and Ramla l-Hamra Bay ( Gozo ) Another three popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so named because of its almost red sand . <p> Relaxation : As you said , there are a lot of relatively cheap shops scattered around Malta . Most fashion shops are found in Sliema , Valletta , St. Julians , Birkirkara and Hamrun . Lounges and Restaurants Well priced and the cuisine is amazing . Abundant near Sliema and St. Julians . Clubs and Discos Main clubbing area is Paceville ( St. Julians ) . Very busy on Saturdays and also Friday , however most clubs are still open in the week . The drinks are cheap compared to continental Europe and the vast majority of discoes and clubs are free ( 2 euros per drink ) <p> Mario , thanks so much for your awesome long comment and all the recommendations ! ! I was lucky enough to visit most of the places you mention but would love to return for one of the festivals . I will write more about the places I visited in my next articles on Malta . Thanks again for the fantastic recommendations ! ! <p> Thank you for representing my country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little home with fresh eyes , rather than how we see things , having always been here . <p> I love the fact that you managed to highlight so many key things about our country that makes us unique in our own way and it helps me appreciate my home more , since there are so many more things that you have not even mentioned = <p> May I suggest that the next time you 're over ( there will be a next time I hope ) , you will be accompanied by a local , as there is no better way to discover the hidden gems of this island = <p> Hi Stefan , thanks a lot for your comment ! I was actually accompanied by locals on several excursions and think I got a good insight on Maltese culture , but to get a real picture of what life on Malta is like , I think I 'd have to stay at least for a month .. which I totally would ! I hope I 'll be able to return to Malta soon . <p> Hi , this is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-prized coffee : O ! ! Altough by the pictures you have posted I recognized the place and will be going there , so thank you very much = <p> Ps I would really recommend this if you are ever again in Malta the best pastizzi are found in Rabat , very close to Mdina ! And if you are ever in Mdina again ( unless you have n't went there already ) an afternoon lunch at the Fontanella restaurant is just amazing where you dine if you are luck enough with an awesome view . <p> Jason I saw coffee that low-priced in several locations , actually ! = I 'll keep Rabat in mind for the best pastizzi next time I 'm in Malta thanks for the tip ! I did manage to have an afternoon lunch at Fontanella though ! ! <p> I 've always thought Malta sounded an interesting place to visit but never quite made it there . I can see I 've missed out it looks amazing . Exactly the type of place I love ( although I might give the party mile a miss ! ) <p> Absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malta at some point in the future . Love how you featured the door knockers , those types of unique things always catch my eye ! Thanks for the beautiful article and the information ! <p> This country looks amazing . We were recently offered a job teaching English in Malta and we too had to look up where in the world it was . Unfortunately , we had to decline the job , but looks like an amazing place to travel to = <p> I fell in love with Malta on Saturday 14th March 1964 , the day my Royal Navy husband and I arrived . He was posted there for almost two years . I have been in love with Malta ever since , even though it has changed dramatically over the decades . The old Malta was the best . <p> Hi Dany , What a superb page so glad I found this . As a family we visited Malta for a week in Oct 2012 and had a wonderful holiday . Our son who is now 6 1/2 has chosen Malta as his school project and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help him from your page . Thanks again ! ! <p> As i told you a few months ago , about going to Malta well the time has come we will be there on Saturday . Another thing our grand children have done projects on Malta and as a nanna ( nana ) i am so proud of them , especially when they ring us up for information , and see how happy they are about it all . It is so rewarding . keep up the good work . <p> We have been staying in Gozo for the last week , and we have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it , we stayed at the Grand Hotel where service and food was great also . We hired a car and did a lot of sight seeing , beautiful , and breathtaking views , early everywhere we went we did get lost a view times , but many friendly locals put us back on track , did some swimming and caught up with our relatatives , also visited St Anthonys church in Mgarr , and atended mass , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small island . <p> Found this blog post while researching Malta . Great information and beautiful photos . I am a teacher in Louisiana . I teach 3rd grade . Each year , our school holds an International Festival . It is always a highly anticipated time of the school year ! Each grade level ( K-7 ) chooses a country to study . The classes study the culture ; the climate ; the geography ; etc. tying in all subject areas . The classes study the countries for an entire week and on the last day , we hold a school-wide festival sharing our country with the entire school . This year , we have chosen to study Malta . Sharing a last name with the country has always made me want to visit , but I have n't had the chance . I was wondering if you knew of any crafts or games that are popular with children in Malta . I am trying to plan some activities for my class . Thank you . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142905 @2542905/ <h> Polaroid Of The Week : A Spa Day At The Dead Sea <p> This past week has been an absolute roller coaster of emotions : I got my passport back from the US consulate , with only two days to spare before my flight to Israel , and returned to Israel where I was reunited with one of my favorite people in the world . Sadly , it went downhill from there : first , the half-marathon I was supposed to run yesterday was canceled due to bad weather ( heavy rain in the desert means flash floods ) , and I had trained so hard for this race in Germanys arctic temperatures this month . And then there was Trumps first anti-immigration action which caused this brand new immigrant to feel more anxiety than ever before .

So we decided to still have our spa day and headed to the desert and to the Dead Sea .

@@107142907 @2542907/ <h> Debauchery in paradise : Letting loose in Boracay <p> This pretty much sums up my time in Boracay . When I first set foot on the white sand that made Boracay famous , I had no idea that my stay there ( or should I say : my behavior ? ) would be rather scandalous , but if you 're hoping for some juicy stories , I have to disappoint you . I decided to adopt the good ol ' Vegas slogan for this party island paradise : What happens in Boracay stays in Boracay . It will remain on top of my unforgettable travel experiences for a while , that 's for sure.Admittedly though , Boracay and I were off to a bit of a rough start . For the first couple of days on the island , I was n't sure if I liked it or not . You might think Look at this view , what 's not to like ? . Boracay was one of these places where I had a certain image in my head of what it would be like , and this little island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd been wanting to visit Boracay ever since I first saw photos of this incredible white beach and the stunning colorful sunsets . Posts like this and this that made me add Boracay to list of my dream destinations . The photos I had seen of Boracay evoked a feeling of a tranquil , serene island paradise like I had experienced in Koh Rong or Little Corn Island . <p> So when I arrived in Boracay on a hot night at the end of January , I quickly checked into my hotel and headed straight to the beach , overjoyed to finally be there . <p> What I saw was just not what I had expected . Hundreds of people were strolling up and down a narrow sandy path , lined with restaurant , bars and shops . I was completely unprepared for how busy it was . I am not sure if there is ever a time when Boracay is not busy , or at least less busy , but at the end of January it was crazy how many people there were . It was overwhelming.After recovering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to eat , not sure if I should turn right or left . To my left , I saw the huge yellow M sign which belonged to a shiny new and giant McDonald 's . So I headed left ( south ) instead . Here , I walked by a Subway , and later that night I discovered Johnny Rockets , Sbarro , Pizza Hut , Starbucks and other well-known fast food jaunts . I had just never been to a tropical island with so many fast food chains right on the beach , and found it a bit off-putting.The next morning when I woke up and walked down to the beach and I saw this:And I couldnt help but relax immediately . White Beach is the most famous beach in the Philippines for a reason after all , four kilometers of white sand so soft and powdery that I would n't mind feeling it under my feet every day for the rest of my life . <p> The beach is separated in three divisions , Station 3 in the south , Station 2 in the middle and Station 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or north I would walk , the quieter it would get and the less people I 'd encounter . So I started walking towards the northern end and soon enough the beach felt less crowded . This was much more what I had in mind for my beach getaway in Boracay.I had two choices : I could be upset about the crowds or I could simply accept it for what it was and make the best of it . And how can I blame all the people from Taiwan , Korea and China who have such a glorious beach paradise only a short flight away for wanting to enjoy what 's the definition of the perfect tropical beach ? When you visit Boracay , you can make it exactly what you want it to be . If you 're looking for solitude and quiet beach time , stay in one of the hotels at the far north end of station 1 . If you want to party and be right in the middle of it all , stay in station 2 . If you want to do kitesurfing , do n't  stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the island on Bulabog Beach ( Boracay is still small enough to get from one side of it to the other it on foot , at least on its narrowest part in the middle of the island ) . Speaking of party : I must be the only person in the world who did n't get the memo that Boracay was a party island ! Whenever I mentioned I 'd been in Boracay after leaving the island , the first question was : Did you party a lot ? ' . Apparently , Boracay is the Philippine 's party destination , but I was blissfully unaware of that ( until I got there ) . During my stay right in the middle of it all in Station 2 , I had all the parties right around me but no one to party with . So I decided to move out of my hotel into a hostel further north towards Station 1 . Station 1 meant an emptier beach during day , the hostel meant partying at night . Because I was in the mood to dance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 20s when I danced until the sun came up on the beaches of Ibiza and I remembered how much I loved these beach parties . <p> Moving hotels was the best decision I could have made because my hostel was exactly the social place I needed to meet new people after the anonymity of my hotel . I stayed at the Frendz resort , which has a big open bar and restaurant area ( with super cheap drinks ) in the center and bungalows based around that , only 2 minutes from White Beach . The resort even has free sun chairs at the beach.Every night , a group of party-hungry travelers would gather at the hostel bar and drink until they 'd kick us out , and we would make our way down to the beach bars where we danced in the sand until the early hours . Or until everyone disappeared with their boyfriend / girlfriend for the night . Yes , that 's the kind of place Boracay is =Like I said though : It is completely up to you what you make of your stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just stay further north or south on the beach . If you do n't like crowds , stay away in January and February , when Boracay is the busiest.Even though the ( over ? ) development on White Beach can be hard to take , there are still places on the island where you can find tranquility , for example on Puka Beach ( Shell Beach ) at the northern end of Boracay or Ilig-Iligan Beach in the northeast . ( Check out this comprehensive guide for Puka Beach ) . <p> In the end , I had a hard time leaving Boracay . It is just so easy to get sucked into this lazy life of beach , work , beach , and dancing the night away.While it might not be the serene island experience that I was hoping for , and overwhelmed me at first , it turned out that Boracay was exactly what I had needed.Looking back now , my time on the island was the favorite part of my Philippines trip and I ca n't wait to go back . And speaking of going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go back to the Philippines , but mainly to visit places I did n't make it to this year . Boracay , however , is the #1 place I want to return to . 129333 @qwx989333 <p> Best time to visit : During dry season , between November and May . That 's when the water is calm and nice.How to get there <p> From Kaliko : <p> Do n't  buy the transfer tickets ( van/bus ) on the plane if you arrive on an AirAsia flight . They are selling them for PHP500 , but they 're half the price if you buy the tickets right at the van . <p> The terminal is tiny walk outside and you see half a dozen of minivans that are waiting to bring passengers to Boracay . They are selling tickets for PHP200-PHP250 . Look out for the guys whose sign say 200 . The ride to the ferry terminal takes about 90 minutes . <p> While the ferry ticket is included in the van ticket , you still have to pay a PHP75 environmental fee and a PHP100 terminal fee . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to pay these fees also when leaving Boracay ) . <p> At the terminal in Boracay , there are tricycles waiting to bring passengers to White Beach . They 're either PHP00 for a single person motorbike tricycle or PHP20 for a bigger one shares between 5 people.From Caticlan : <p> If you fly into Caticlan , you can actually walk to the ferry terminal ( 5-10min walk ) , or take a tricycle for 50PHP . <p> Note:Flying into Kalibo is usually cheaper , since it is a bigger airport than Caticlan . Caticlan can only be served by smaller planes that only allow 15 kilos of luggage . Kalibo also offers international destinations such as Seoul , Busan , Taipei , Shanghai , Chengdu , Beijing , Hong Kong , Singapore and Kuala Lumpur . <p> Money : There are plenty of ATMs along the beach.Where to stay : I enjoyed my stay at the Frendz resort and would definitely recommend it , especially if you 're traveling alone . There are bungalows that house dorm rooms ( divided male / female ) for PHP600 /US$13.60 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deluxe bungalows with AC ( PHP1,000 /US$22.70 ) . There is free WiFi throughout the resort . <p> For more accommodation options , check out all 236 Boracay hostels and hotels on Booking.com.Where to eat : My favorite places True Food , an Indian restaurant with lots of vegetarian options , Jony 's Shakes right on the beach in Station 1 ( the avocado banana shake is to die for ) , and TiBraz Sunday Crepes Happy Hour ( 50% off ! ) , Fuel vegan restaurant ( they share a space with TiBraz ) . Zucchero Cafe in Station 2 has good coffee and an upstairs with great views over the beach . The cheapest Happy Hour beer I could find was Kurts at Station 3 where a Happy Hour beer was only 35PHP ( US$0.80 ) . There are several other cheap ( and quieter ) sunset bars in Station 1 . Best sunset spot : The Spiderhouse , a bar perched onto the side of a cliff on the far end of Station 1 ( you can walk there from White Beach " about 30 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resort ; rooms start at PHP2,980 ( US$67 ) . Have you been to Boracay ? What did you think about the Philippines most popular island ? 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 53 Comments <p> When I was planning my Philippines trip a couple years ago I was turned off by the development of Boracay so I skipped it , but after reading so many blogs about it I am totally regretting that decision . It is now on my Asian itinerary for this winter = <p> Lots of people I met in the Philippines skipped Boracay for that very same reason , but I could n't understand why they would n't want to spend any time at this glorious beach ! ! Maybe our paths cross in Boracay this winter ? ! = <p> I 'm in Boracay at the moment and completely agree with everything you 've mentioned ! It is pretty touristy but if you want to get away from it all , the other beaches on the island are beautiful and station 3 is so chilled . Glad to see you loved your time here as much as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard from another friend who is in Boracay right now that it is even busier than it was when I was there in late Jan/ early Feb , can that even be ? ! Enjoy your time in Boracay , Lauren ! <p> After watching these pictures I realized what Boracay is ! Just an amazing place I have ever seen in where the beach , sand , nail blue water , waveall is mind-blowing ! Keeping up writing and sharing such this one . <p> Such a great post Dany . Ive been there twice now for an Ultimate Frisbee beach tourney which rocks . <p> And while its beautiful I agree its so crowded and touristy on at least that side of the island where you are . Other side is supposedly more chill and a bit like it used to be before it got over exposed . <p> It reminded me of a cruiseship on land where by day you enjoy the beach and water sports and shopping and each night the same entertainment happens , people gorge themselves on food and alcohol and party and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ultimate Frisbee Tourament that sounds so cool ! I did n't  even know that this existed but now I have to look it up and see what exactly you do in such a tournament = And by the way the cruise ship analogy is just PERFECT ! ! I actually had to leave escape from the island at some point because I could n't handle the excessive drinking/partying anymore = <p> Ahhhh this is great ! ! I was debating for awhile on which place to go to in the Philippines and I finally decided to include Boracay . This makes me so excited to go now ! I will be heading there in August = Thanks for the great tips ! <p> I was considering skipping it because I had heard how developed and westernised it has become but that beach I 'm still definitely going and will stay at Station 1 or 3 to get away from the thick of the party <p> Great question ! I actually had the best internet speeds at the Frendz resort where I was staying . The only other acceptable wifi I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starbucks ( even though it was hit and miss there , but I enjoyed writing with aircon there ) and Zucchero Cafe . <p> I was in Boracay about this time 4 years ago ugh 4 years has flown by ! Absolutely loved it and its still one of my favourite places in the world to this day . I had a few nights that got totally out of hand ( what do you expect with all day happy hours ) and one night that has eclipsed any others . Like you Dany , I 'll be keeping my mouth closed on that one ! Crazy yet blissful island . <p> do n't  recommend boracay in the summer ( March- may ) . Its crazy touristry and tends to get dirty . Esp Holy Week &amp; Labor Day ( first wk may ) . No school &amp; the young party peeps r dominating ! Island can reach level of Ibiza party scenes . Seaweeds R largely present as well due to big crowd &amp; much calmer weather can make a disappointing visit . Low season maybe better to visit , bec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more relaxing ! Something to consider &amp; expect if u plan to visit . Its a stunning place , but timing can disappoint some if not aware . <p> Yes ! Due to dry season &amp; water is so much calmer ( no waves ) , and u put the large big crowds making a mess , the shore builds up . It goes back to normal afterwards . They melt automatically . The locals likes to keep them and do n't  want cleaned up because it is what bleaches the sand . But the island do a great job maintaining the cleanliness of the place and beaches after . Just avoid the big crowd season , and u sure will fall in love w the island ! <p> Awesome site Dani ! I was reading up on your other trips when I stumbled upon your stuff on the Philippines and I had to take a look . <p> I think you 're take on Boracay is pretty accurate . Some folks go for the beach with the laid back atmosphere and everything that goes with that . Some go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives ( who am I kidding ? ) . While everybody I know hates the over development and abundance of usual establishments , some people actually go to Boracay for the food too . There 's plenty of good food to enjoy . No , McDonalds , Subway , Starbucks , etc are n't  on that list but do email me if you wan na know more . <p> Also as Ivy mentioned above , skip the local holidays . There 's a sizable crowd of foreigners skipping winter from November to around Feb/March but that 's nothing to the crowd of locals skipping their usual lives who flock to Boracay on holidays . Plus/minus 4 days to May 1 is probably busiest . Think spring break in Cancun or something . Best to avoid , unless you want to meet lotsa locals . I can go on and on about what to do/not do . But best to let you come back and experience them yourself . = <p> Looking forward to spending some more time on your site . I have a boring day job but I try to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Email me if you want some tips on the Philippines . Btw full disclosure : I 'm Filipino living in Manila . Cheers ! <p> Alvin thanks for mentioning the busiest periods in Boracay ! I 'll make sure to plan my return NOT on any of those dates = And please feel free to send some recommendations for good food in Boracay my way , I 'd love to try out some of them next time I go = Thanks again ! <p> It looks gorgeous , but its very interesting to see your photo of how busy it gets . It can sometimes be so hard to know what a famous destination will be like because people almost always show it in its best light and from the best angle when they write about it . <p> Hannah Ive never seen so many chain restaurants right at a beach anywhere in the world , and I could n't believe how many there were considering how TINY Boracay is . But nonetheless White Beach is one of the most beautiful beaches I 've ever been to . And yes those epic sunsets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi Dany , you do not advise to purchase transfer from onboard Air Asia . Will there be long queue or so much hassle if we purchase upon arrival at Kalibo Airport ? Worry that the locals might quote us higher than booking through tour for land/sea door to door transfer . Also will the local be able to speak good English ? <p> Hi Dany . I 'm glad you found the same ambience as me . I have been going to Boracay every year for the last 12 years so I have gotten to know the place pretty well . For sure its a party island but its also whatever you decide to make it . Strolll to Station 3 in the evening and settle in at the Red Pirates bar and chill out with expats and locals or go the other way and end up at the party place , Club Parow in Station 1 which spills right out on to the beach . I 've decided this is going to be my new home and planning to retire there next year . Ca n't wait ! <p> Great blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you really summed it all up wonderfully . So , here 's the thing , I 'm planning to visit the Philippines in May , and Boracay is definitely a place I want to go to while I 'm there . So how did you go about it ? Like , what airline did you book your flight with and how many months in advance ? Also how much ? I 'm also on a budget , and with my wife and son with me . That 's why I prefer to try that Frendz hostel you stayed in , since its away from all the drinking and partying . I just want a quiet and relaxing getaway with my family . Thanks , I hope to hear from you soon . <p> Hi John First of all .. I would n't say Frendz is NOT a party place it definitely is a place where people hang out at the bar at night , but they close at 10pm . ( Still , there is a noise level that you might find disturbing , depending on how old your son is ) . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend you look for a place to stay in Station 3 . I booked my flights into Boracay with AirAsia , about 3 weeks in advance and still got a good deal ( about $40 ) . I booked my flight out of Boracay only when I got to the island , with only a few days advance notice , so I paid much more than I 'd wanted to ( about $120 ) . There are good deals on Cebu Pacific if you book ahead of time ( I saw flights for around $30 ) . Next time I go I 'll make sure to book my flights in and out at least four weeks in advance . You can fly either into Caticlan or into Kalibo ; Caticlan is closer to Boracay ( in walking distance from the jetty ) but airfare is more expensive to Caticlan . ( See my remarks in the How to get there section ) . I hope this helps = Enjoy Boracay ! <p> Thanks for the reply . Yeah , I 've been doing some research , and it seems the more affordable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or get a place at the other beaches besides White Beach . Wanted to do it your way , instead of booking a vacation package . But as first-time tourists , would n't the packages be better ? Like , stress-wise and budget-wise ? We 've never traveled before , so this is gon na be a first for all of us . <p> How difficult is it to find an affordable place to stay , say around the 1st-2nd week of May ? Me and the wife are really psyched and looking forward to this . Our 6 yr. old does n't  even know , I want it to be a surprise . Thanks again . <p> Follow-up question : Did you book your flights directly on the airline websites , or do you use some other travel sites for your bookings ? Also , any advice on hotel booking sites ? Me and the missus got our hearts set on Spider House ( the view is amazing ) , even though its a bit more than our budget allows . Were just gon na have to cut down our 1-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher hotel rate . Thanks again . <p> Wow ! Nice post ! I myself experience the beauty of Boracay ! I 've tried Orient Beach Boracay , a botique hotel that offers high standard of service . They also offers transfers and gives complimentary shuttle . I really love Boracay , with its sunset view and also the hospitable people . And btw , this out of town does n't  cost me too much . Imagine for 888 pesos I 've sleep in a cozy and peaceful hotel . Try this hotel now ! Currently they are giving nice discounts ! <p> What a lovely post Danny = Stunning Boracay the beach , the sand , the turquoise blue water and amazingly sunset And I can say that Boracay has Worlds best sunset spots . Wow ! This Island was really blessed . And moving on Puka Beach which is also famous in Boracay I confess that this area of Boracay was extremely beautiful , more relaxing and serene = <p> Interesting write up and photos but all now out of date I fear . The island is being destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rubbish everywhere . Thankfully this will help ruin the golden goose and people will not return . I live in the Philippines and it is so sad to see the decline in this once pristine and quiet location , home to the displaced indigenous Ati people . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142908 @2542908/ <h> Living it up in Manila <p> Skip Manila if you can , fly straight to Boracay ! .. Do n't  spend time in Manila , its a shithole .. Warnings like these were what I kept hearing when I told people I was starting my South East Asia trip with a stint in the Philippines . <p> But coming from Hong Kong , Manila was still the most convenient starting point , and I wanted to head north to the Banaue rice terraces and the Hanging Coffins in Sagada from there . So Manila would definitely be part of my trip to the Philippines . I expected to hate Manila though , to be honest . <p> Flying into Manila <p> I had booked myself into a hostel near Bonifacio Global City , which is the new business district of Manila that is currently still being developed , while there are dozens of brand new condo towers , office high rises , malls and well-manicured little parks already finished , there are more high rises mainly luxurious condo towers being built right now . Global City is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . It is hard to believe that ten years ago , this very place was a swamp . On my first stroll through the neighborhood I was shocked to see a Lamborghini and a Ferrari car dealership , and more fine eateries and home design shops that- I would find in a comparable neighborhood in Berlin . This was definitely not how I had pictured Manila.This is supposed to be a third world country , I kept thinking to myself , and yet this part of town was nicer than most of the downtown areas of major cites I 'd visited in the US . I was stunned . <p> Global City skyscrapers on the right side <p> A stark contrast to the modern new-builds was the small neighborhood behind my hostel ( which was separated from Global City through a huge golf court ) which reminded me a lot of Thailand . Little alleyways were full of plants in front of the houses to bring at least a little green into the concrete jungle that is Manila , cats were lazing around , laundry was drying in the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalls were frying up meat . This neighborhood was n't necessarily what I 'd call a shithole either , and people were always very friendly when I was passing through . Manila turned out to be quite different than expected.A couple of days later a reader of mine , Carla , offered to show me around town , an offer which I happily accepted . In a city of nearly 12 million people , it can be hard to figure out what the best places to see are , so a local guide is always a plus , especially when its such a charming and funny one like Carla . <p> We started our night at the Corner Tree Cafe , a vegetarian restaurant in Makati , which can be described as Manila 's downtown and the financial center of the Philippines . I had heard horror stories about how vegetarian-unfriendly the food was in the Philippines , and had been a bit worried I might not find any good food . But so far , everything I 'd eaten was absolutely delicious and vegetarian options were abound. - I even found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothies , near Global City.After dinner , we drove through Makati , and I marveled at high rises and fancy malls , and again : this was n't anything like I 'd pictured Manila ! We stopped at the Greenbelt , a giant outdoor shopping mall with cafes , restaurants and shops . Everything was super fancy , and the restaurants and cafes had a funkier decor than most cafes in Europe . I could see why this mall had won several awards for design.The only place I disliked was Cafe Havana , apparently a popular pick-up place for Western guys to pick up Filipinas . The many single , middle-aged Western men at the outdoor tables who were leering at the young , lightly-dressed Filipinas confirmed this rumor . <p> The night was still young , and Carla asked me if I wanted to have a drink in a speakeasy bar . A speakeasy in Manila ? ! This city kept surprising me . Of course I had to see it ! When we walked through the doors of the unassuming Space Cafe , I wouldve never known that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back end of the cafe there was an Exit door which turned out to be the entrance to a dimly lit speakeasy bar . My favorite part ? All the fancy cocktails were around PHP190 US$4.30 ! After this pleasant surprise , I was ready for another bar experience , but first I got a surprise that made me even giddier with excitement than $2 cocktails : a Tobys Estate Coffee Shop ! My go-to coffee shop in Brooklyn , which I visit on a regular basis when I am in New York , and you can imagine my surprise to see this Brooklyn hipster hangout in Manila . To be fair though- Tobys was founded in Australia , so I should n't have been too surprised . But again : not exactly how I pictured Manila.Our next stop was just a few doors down from Tobys , a chic bar named Hooch that was buzzing with atmosphere and filled with locals and expats alike . Drinks here were a bit more on the pricey side , but the unique cocktail creations were worth the splurge , like this upside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had expected , and I had yet to see the historic part of town , Intramuros , the walled neighborhood established by the Spanish when thy came to the Philippines in 1571 . Prior to my arrival , I had come across several raving reviews of Carlos Celtrans Intramuros walking tour and decided to join it . Lucky for me , Carla had also heard about Carlos and was interested in checking out the tour as well , and so we met again on a sunny Sunday afternoon to get a tour of Intramuros.It turned out that this tour is much more popular than I had anticipated when we arrived at the meeting port at Fort Santiago , there were about fifty people waiting for Carlos , who is quite a character . Apparently he finished an acting degree but did n't  find work as an actor , and ended up running tours in Manila instead and trust me , these tours are more like a performance than anything else . He had several props on him , costumes , sweets to keep us entertained , and acted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them . The tour was well worth the steep price tag and I learned so much more about Manilas history ( including why the city has become a city that people say visitors to the Philippines should skip ) than I would have had I just wandered around Intramuros with my guidebook in hand . <p> Carlos Celdran <p> Intramuros itself was refreshingly different from the skyscrapers , malls and modern office towers in Makati . Old Spanish-colonial houses , historic churches , a stunning cathedral and horse-drawn carriages made me think of Casco Viejo in Panama , which felt similarly remote to the glitzy skyscrapers of Panama Citys New Town.The tour ended with a sample of Halo-halo , a popular Filipino dessert made of- shaved ice- and- evaporated milk- to which various boiled sweet beans ( like kidney beans ) , jello and fruits ( jack fruit , tapioca , sweet potato ) are added.After the tour , we stayed in Intramuros for some sunset drinks at the Skydeck rooftop bar on top of the Bayleaf Hotel " sadly , the sun did n't cooperate that evening with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the perfect spot to watch the sunset over the bay on a sunny day . Carla had yet another surprise in store for me when she took me to The Wholesome Table , an organic restaurant in Global City that looked just as chic as the organic restaurants I 've visited in the U.S. or elsewhere.We ended my visit to Manila with a visit to another speakeasy bar , this one even better hidden than Exit , a black iron door at the ground floor of what looked like an office building , and inside a small dark bar hidden from the outside world . <p> I left Manila with a smile on my face , still in disbelief about how different the city was from the image I 'd had in my mind before I got there . Good company , excellent vegetarian food and fancy drinks if those were signs for things to come , I 'd have an amazing time in the Philippines . 129333 @qwx989333 <h> - Where to stay in Manila <p> Most hostels are located in Makati , which is the downtown part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , movie theaters and other amenities . Our Melting Pot and Hilik Boutique Hostel ( both in the same building ) are popular hostels and good places to meet other travelers . There are also some hostels ( and high-end hotels ) in Bonifacio Global City , the brand new part of town where you find lots of fancy eateries on the High Street , as well as some nicer clubs . I felt very safe there , but it 's quite far from downtown and from Intramuros . <p> Early Bird Breakfast Club , - GF Fort Pointe 2 Building , The Fort Complex , 28th St there are more branches around the city ( fantastic breakfast place ( all-day breakfasts ) with several branches around the city <p> Toby 's Estate ( best coffee in Manila , several branches around the city , the one on L.P. Leviste Street in Makati seems to be the largest one ) <p> If you stay in Makati , head to the Greenbelt outdoor mall for a number of restaurants , cafes and bars . <h> Where to drink in Manila <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a cozy speakeasy with fantastic cocktails " you wo n't see much of a sign though , only the black door " knock to be let in ) <h> What to do in Manila <p> There 's not much sightseeing per se to do in Manila ; I did a lot of walking around and just took in the city . Intramuros is the most picturesque part of Manila and if you 're interested in learning more about Manila 's history and Filipino culture , I highly recommend taking Carlos Celdran walking tour . He runs it on weekends only , and promises illusions , candy , flowers , and carriage rides . I can confirm that all of this is true . Reservation by email essential , price : PHP1,100 ( US$25 ) . <h> Other useful information <h> Airport <p> Note that the four terminals of Ninoy Aquino International Airport are not in one building , but scattered around town . If you fly in internationally and plan to fly to another destination domestically , it 's likely that you 'll be leaving from a different terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you might end up at the wrong terminal . Also leave enough time between flights if you have to change terminals because traffic in Manila is insane . <h> Getting around <p> The easiest way to get around is by taxi , make sure that the driver turns on his meter . <p> There are also jeepneys ( shared pick-up trucks ) but I could n't figure out their routes . <p> The MRT ( elevated railway ) is a good option if you happen to stay near it . The network is n't great and does n't  connect all of Metro Manila . 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 27 Comments <p> Wow , Manila looks quite different from the way I remember it . Its been ten years since I last lived there , and four years since my previous visit . From how you describe things , it looks like I need to pay another visit soon to get updated ! <p> My mind is blown after reading this . I only spent one night in Manila and I saw barely anything other than the airport . I 'd also heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Manila is SO full of history and I love seeing that there are parts of town that are so well-preserved . <p> I had heard that Manila had a really great selection of vegetarian restaurants , so I 'm glad to hear it confirmed . During my two months in the Philippines I cant say I had an easy time as a vegetarian . But I did find really great options in cities like Cebu City . My boyfriend and I have been thinking A LOT about going back to the Philippines this summer . We did n't  get a chance to do Manila , Sagada or the Banaue Rice Terraces . Based on this Im definitely going to give Manila a fair shot next time I 'm in town ! <p> Justine yeah , like I said , I expected to hate Manila . If you go back you 'll have to give it another chance . I can give you some more recommendations for veggie restaurants .. did n't  get to check them out this time around but I hope I 'll get to try some of them when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Really great to know on veggy fare , as I heard the same thing and my wife is pure veggy . Things could get dicey if we have no options ; she 's a bit food anxious LOL . I blame her not . After doing Fiji for 4 months we were relegated to super basic stuff . <p> Manila looks awesome . Per as is the case some urban areas get a bad rap but a trip usually paints a different pic . How about that ? Your BK cafe shop , here in Manila ? Way neat . <p> I recall seeing a NYC-NJ style diner in Chiang Mai , Thailand Butter Is Better run by a NYC guy and nearly flipping out . I was in heaven . REAL tri-state food ! I went there only 20 to 30 times over a year or less , LOL . <p> Kirsten , you have no idea how much your comment means to me because when I wanted to publish the post I looked through my photos of Manila and thought I did n't  have any decent pictures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most people do n't  . That 's why Manila has such a bad reputation . You stayed in the better parts of town . Most people stay in Manila City ( the old city ; its a crazy mix of a dozen or so " cities " ) . The old city of Manila is one of the dirtier and filthier parts . You 'll notice that area on the way to Intramuros . Its a shame that it got left behind as neighboring areas developed . The Philippine government is n't really good at planning . They take laissez faire to a whole new level . Many visitors to Metro Manila ( as the whole metropolis is called ) make the mistake of staying in Manila City ( the old city ) thinking that its still the main " downtown " area . But Metro Manila is weird . There is no single downtown . In fact , there are 5 or 6 CBDs ( Central Business Districts , that 's how they call it now ) scattered around the place . Makati and BGC are two of those . Ortigas is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often horrible as people move between those places by cars . <p> Thanks so much for the perspective-change on Manila . I had heard mixed reviews but the more I reviewed the more I was thinking that perhaps it did not live up to its bad rap . Makes me feel much better about choosing to spend a little more time here than originally planned . We will be sure to give you a shout out in our blog ! <p> What an incredible post ! Thank you for appreciating Manila , I am from the Philippines and I might say it may not be the nicest place here , but hey ! I would still recommend this on top of everything ! Manila is alive and still growing ! Again , on behalf of the Filipino people , thank you ! More power to you and to your blog = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142909 @2542909/ <h> Polaroid Of The Week : Sunset and surfers in San Pancho , Mexico <p> The last few days in Guadalajara were rainy , grey and cold . I had planned to stay there longer , but the weather made me change my plans . Instead of spending more time inland , I 'd head straight to the coast . My first stop would be Sayulita , a small surfer town on the Pacific , and then I would visit San Pancho , a few miles further north , even smaller than the already tiny Sayulita , but a few of my friends had spent a winter there a few years back and loved it . <p> I could n't have made a better decision than traveling to the coast . I started my journey on a rainy morning in Guadalajara ( it was pouring down the second day in a row ) and a couple of hours into the bus ride , the rain stopped and the scenery began to look a lot more tropical . Four hours after hopping on that bus , I was let out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coconuts fresh off a palm tree . The air felt sticky and hot .

I went on jungle hikes , on sweaty runs along the coast , I sipped fresh coconuts and ate too many tacos .

@@107142910 @2542910/ <h> The best countries to retire for same-sex couples <p> There are a lot of good things going on these days . The landslide of states in the U.S. where same-sex marriage is legal is gaining momentum . The UK just saw its first domestic same-sex marriages performed . The IRS now taxes same-sex marrieds at the same rate as heterosexual couples . Okay , that last one is a bit of a mixed blessing . But still , life 's good for you and your spouse . <p> With so many older couples finally getting the chance to legally marry , many of them are already preparing for retirement as newly-weds . Given the dream of retiring to some exotic locale with good food and great beaches it might be worth exploring the who 's who of nations that are friendly to same-sex couples . So , for your retirement consideration , may I present the top three retirement destinations for same-sex couples . <h> First , the honorable mentions : <p> Argentina <p> Though same-sex marriage is legal in Argentina , there are very few protections against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene Argentina earns a mention , but does n't come close to ranking on our list . <p> South Africa <p> The only African nation to provide full legal protection to same-sex marriages , social acceptance is lagging significantly behind , leaving South Africa to be a mixed bag for gay and lesbian couples . <p> Portugal <p> Portugal lags behind many other nations in terms of both legal and social progress regarding same-sex marriages . However , Portugal 's legal system does have one area where it exceeds the standards of our top pick for nations to move to . Portugal is the only nation that permits the marrying of same-sex couples with no consideration of either residency or the legal status of such a marriage in the home countries of the participants . With a pleasant climate and very long coastline , it can be tempted to overlook some of the inconveniences and retire to Portugal . <p> Canada <p> Canada is hospitable to same-sex couples married within Canada , but has ongoing issues regarding any marriage performed abroad . Add that to the climate and Canada does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's legal structure is one of the best in the world when it comes to the rights of same-sex married couples , and is currently headed by woman who has been married to her wife since 2002 . Unfortunately the population of Iceland is so sparse there is no gay scene outside of Rekjavik . <p> New Zealand <p> A new arrival on the scene , New Zealand only recently legalized same-sex marriages . While same-sex marriages share the same rights as heterosexual marriages , the legal system is still struggling with working out many of the kinks . This is only made more difficult by the fact that the law granting same-sex marriage rights does not extend to any of New Zealand 's territorial holdings . <p> Denmark <p> While same-sex marriages are given the full rights that are shared by heterosexual marriages in Denmark itself , Greenland and the Faroes ( both belonging to Denmark ) share the same problem that is seen in New Zealand by not permitting same-sex marriages . <p> England and Wales <p> England is the most recent country to have same-sex marriages established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that New Zealand has suffered , it shares in the jurisdictional problems seen in both New Zealand and Denmark . Of the English extraterritorial holdings only Wales recognizes same-sex marriages . Jurisdictions such as Gibraltar and North Ireland continue to bar same-sex marriages . <p> Norway and Sweden <p> Norway and Sweden are both even more accommodating than Canada , with thriving gay communities in Oslo and Stockholm . However , being located even more northerly than most of the population of Canada , the climate does not encourage long walks on the beach . <p> The Netherlands <p> The Netherlands was the first nation in modern times to legalize same-sex marriage , establishing them on the 1st of April , 2001 . Amsterdam is often considered to be the most gay friendly city in the world . With a full suite of laws protecting the equal treatment of gay marriages adding to the moderate temperatures and lively culture , the Netherlands is a popular destination for retiring same-sex couples . Only one thing holds the Netherlands back . In order to marry in the Netherlands at least one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Netherlands do recognize same-sex marriages legally conducted abroad this is a minor hiccup in an otherwise sterling record . <p> France <p> A newcomer to same-sex marriages , lesbian and gay couples were granted the right to marry within France in 2012 . While both legal and social acceptance are high in France , this beautiful and idyllic Gallic country is held back from our top countries list owing to a legal system that does not recognize most foreign same-sex marriages . <h> And now , the list ! <p> #3 Uruguay <p> Uruguay is the surprising dark horse in our list . A nation that is not on most people 's list , Uruguay found itself in a peculiar position in 2012 when a judicial court ruled that Uruguay had to extend all marital rights and protections to any marriage that was legal in the country in which the marriage was conducted , even though Uruguay itself did not permit such marriages to take place inside its own borders . Legislation was quickly put forth to remedy this by legalizing marriages conducted within the country . Since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , but throughout the world in its ensuring the rights of lesbian and gay married couples . With a pleasant subtropical climate and lively society , Uruguay is one of the top places to be for retired same-sex couples . It 's only its relative youth in terms of legalization that is keeping Uruguay in our #3 slot . <p> #2 Belgium <p> Belgium is a leader in same-sex marriage rights and has been for years . While Uruguay has a slight edge in terms of its relationship with foreign same-sex marriages ( non-citizen couples may marry only if one partner has been in the country for at least three months ) the fact that Belgium has had eleven years of same-sex marriage without any hiccups gives it the higher ranking . Politically Belgium is one of the most accepting nations in the world . The current prime minister had come out as gay long before his election to the top seat of the nation . Socially Belgium is a major contender . With major gay communities in every significant city and 62% of all Belgians believing same-sex marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few places that can rival the quality of life a retired same-sex couple could enjoy in Belgium . With all these factors going for it , Belgium approaches the top of our list of the top three best countries to retire to , coming in at #2 . <p> #1 Spain <p> To the surprise of many people , Spain tops our list of the best nations on earth for a same-sex couple . In spite of continued comments of opposition on the part of a scattering of public officials , Spain provides the strongest legal support of same-sex marriage of any nation in the world . Spanish law exceeds even that of Belgium by permitting the marriage of all same-sex couples , even if both are citizens of nations that do not permit gay marriage and neither has established residency in Spain . Strongly Catholic , the population of Spain recently broke with church doctrine by expressing an 88% support rate for the gay community , according to a recent Pew Research Center survey . Every significant city in Spain has a thriving gay community enjoying Spain 's welcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can expect to be given the same pleasant welcome any other couple might . Combined with the low cost of living and housing prices , pleasant subtropical climate , and the extensive Mediterranean coastline Spain tops our list of nations for same-sex couples to retire to . <p> So there you have it .

All are known for their friendly people , progressive legal systems , engaging culture , and pleasant climates .

Luckily , I will return to Europe the same way I came to Asia , which means I 'll get to go back to Hong Kong soon , and that 's also the reason why I took things easy this time . I was extremely exhausted when I arrived in Hong Kong , my fifth country this month , and just was n't up for the hikes and long sightseeing treks I had planned . <p> Admittedly , I was also pretty overwhelmed by the city for the first two days ( the amount of people , the noise , the intensity of everything ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the swing of things ( meaning : exploring a city on my own , instead having someone to take me around like recently in Stockholm or Istanbul ) .

Rather than ticking sights off my list , I strolled through markets and neighborhoods , sampled local coffee shops ( and was ecstatic when I found one that was as good as my favorite coffee shop in the world ! ) , took in the magnificent skyline and spent time people watching on the waterfront .

If you 're a first-time visitor to Amsterdam , make sure to also check out these two great itineraries : <p> There are three peaceful , quiet little islands in Amsterdam : Prinsen , Bickers and Realen .

Here are five destinations with great LGBT scenes , some might be obvious , but others might surprise you : <h> Edinburgh , Scotland <p> While it 's easy to compartmentalize Scotland with the rest of the UK , it actually has its own liberal government who are very outspoken on gay rights . They passed a law in 2014 to legalize same-sex marriage with an overwhelming majority in their parliament " an attitude which is reflected on Scotland 's streets .

@@107142914 @2542914/ <h> Breathtaking Bolivia : Our week in Potos+ , the worlds highest city <p> At first , the idea of buying coca leaves seems almost rebellious because you connect it with cocaine . The first time you drink coca tea , it 's like a novelty . <p> But after a few days in the world 's highest city , coca became an integral part of our day ; the only thing we connected it to was the way it soothed our altitude sickness . <p> We spent our first full week in Bolivia settled in Potos+ , a colonial city at 13,500ft ( 4,050m ) , which is high even for the Andes . The city center charmed us immediately and the history here is so fascinating all we wanted to do was get out and explore . <p> The problem was that in order to explore it , we 'd have to huff and puff our way up and down the city 's hilly streets at an average altitude that would be the peak of a climb in Europe or North America . <p> Whenever we walked downhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we could walk and talk about the beauty of the buildings or wonder about what it must have been like when the Spanish discovered the silver in the Cerro Rico mountain that looms over Potos+ . We would imagine life here as the Spanish subjugated the indigenous locals to extract it all and even brought in over 30,000 African slaves to work the mines and the massive amount of man , horse and llama power it would have taken to get the goods to the coast to ship to Spain . When you 're walking down these well-maintained colonial streets , it is easy to feel connected to the bustle here in the 16th and 17th centuries , when it was one the world 's richest and most populated cities . <p> All of that imagination was possible while going downhill . <p> Walking uphill ( which was at least half the time ) we could only focus on the burning in our lungs , or trying not to attract attention with our obnoxious panting , always stopping to drink water at the end of every hill . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut back the headaches and dizziness of being at altitude . <p> Even most of the sightseeing involved climbing hundreds of stairs to the tops of cathedrals for incredible views . Our favorite stop was the Convento de San Francisco , which can only be seen on a guided tour . We climbed up through the tower onto the roof for incredible views of- Potos+ and the Cerro Rico , but it was the roof tiles themselves that were the most fascinating . <p> Each and every one was formed by the thighs of former miners who were taken in by this monastery , the only escape for a small fraction of miners , the rest of whom otherwise die an early death from silicosis or mining accidents . Between 2 and 8 million miners ' ( slaves ) worked and perished in the mines throughout the three centuries of colonial rule , most of whom would live below ground for weeks or months at a time without coming-out for fresh air . <p> The silver mines were depleted by 1800 and although tin and other minerals continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's slow and steady economic decline had begun . You can learn much more about the history and present day conditions of Cerro Rico on a mine tour , the town 's main and very controversial tourist attraction . The tours are dangerous , have a human zoo ' element and yet also provide international awareness for the terrible conditions for the miners . Despite her altitude sickness , Dani was eager to do a tour of the mines and I decided to sit it out . She talks about the intense experience in detail here . <p> Most tourists spend just a day or two in town between stops in Sucre and the Salar de Uyuni salt flats tour , but if you can stand the altitude , spend a few extra days in what is easily one of the most important historic cities in all of South America . <h> What to do in Potos+ <p> Tour the cooperative silver mines of Cerro Rico- <p> There are several companies , some more ethical ' than others . Check the reviews on Tripadvisor to make sure you book the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not just says so . <p> San Francisco Convent and Temple- <p> Visit this gorgeous example of 16th century architecture ( do n't forget to appreciate those roof tiles ! ) on a guided 1.5hr tour .

Guided tours in English or Spanish lead you through 20 galleries that show everything from weapons to archeology to the coin presses themselves . <p> Cathedral- <p> Set on the town square , you can enter through a nearly nondescript back entrance , pay 15Bs ( US$2.17 ) per person for a quick tour of the beautiful , yet unfinished cathedral 's restorations and climb to the top for views of the city from the bell tower . The cathedral is open from 9-12 in the morning and 3-6 in the afternoon . <p> La Merced Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this highly recommended rooftop cafe almost every day of our stay in- Potos+ , it was somehow never open . Sipping coffee with incredible views is supposed to be a highlight to a visited to Potos+ . <p> Discover the beautiful colonial architecture- <p> Make sure to plan in time to stroll around town the best time is earlier in the morning or on Sundays when less traffic makes the narrow streets easier to wander . Our favorite things to spot are the incredibly ornate carved wooden balconies that hang over the sides of the colonial buildings throughout the center . You 'll quickly see why the entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . <h> Where to eat &amp; drink in Potos+ <p> Right on the main square , the high ceilings , dark wood and big windows here make you feel as though you were part of the Spanish upper class who would have enjoyed this place centuries ago .

Come for dinner and order veggie burgers with quinoa , oats or lentils for only 9Bs ( US$1.30 ) or full dinners for 15Bs ( US$2.17 ) <p> La Taverna- <p> This upscale French restaurant serves up quality local dishes as well . Food options are very limited for vegetarians , but our soup and salad were lovely . <p> This backpacker joint just off the main square attracts plenty of locals too , with its cheap food including great set lunch menus , good cakes/cookies and not-painfully-slow Wi-Fi makes this the kind of place you can come for lunch and stay for coffee . <p> La Casona <p> This was our favorite place to grab a drink in Potos+ .

Much like baseball players with chewing tobacco , you fold up ten or so leaves and pack the wad into your cheek . We did this on the salt flats tour and Macchu Pichu trek , but not for everyday use . <p> Drink water Altitude sickness dehydrates you so make sure to drink three or more liters of water per day . <p> Avoid alcohol Altitude sickness dehydrates you and alcohol only makes this worse , plus who needs an even bigger headache or more dizziness of a hangover the next day . <p> Get acclimatized The most important thing you can do , even if you have spent time in La Paz and Sucre coming from the north or Uyuni coming from the south , is adjust to the altitude .

We did n't  make time to stop in Potosi when we were in Bolivia last year , but now I wish we had ; sounds lovelythough I remember just having a headache when we passed through there changing buses from Uyuni to Sucre ! <p> I will be interested to hear what Dani thinks about the mines . I cant decide whether to visit them or not . Have you seen the film the film/documentary The devils mine ? It is such an eye opening film about the work conditions of the miners . The film is about a child miner who has to work in the mines to support his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is one of the saddest films I have ever seen , but really worth watching . <p> Tammy yes , we did watch the movie in Sucre . Do n't  ask the people in Potosi about the movie though they are n't  the biggest fans . Apparently the boy was n't even a real miner , they just paid someone $200 to play the role , and the miners made sure to point out that there havent been any children working in the mines for many years . <p> That does n't  surprise me that they say there are no child miners anymore . It reflected incredibly bad on them when the film came out and they got a lot of criticism from child rights activists and NGOs . There are still a lot of national and international NGOs working with child miners in Potosi ( i.e. on their labour rights , or providing them with education so that they can have decent jobs once they finish school ) . I do n't  know if the film was real or not , but it would surprise me if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was filmed about 10 years ago the issues with child labour were definitely much worse than they are now . <p> Our guide assured us that there were no child miners in Cerro Rico anymore if you end up touring the mine , please ask your guide about it and have a look around ! I 'd love to know what you think . I still have my doubts about who to believe ( the movie or the Bolivians/miners ) but I did n't  see any children anywhere up there on the Cerro . It would break my heart to know that kids still go in there and have to endure these horrible conditions . <p> The mines must be extremely haunting and subduing experience .. From what I-ve heard and read they are at least 50 years behind the rest of the world when it comes to safety measures and equipment with deaths and accidents happening quite frequently .. The city itself is stunning , though .

The saltwater pool is one of the most beautiful swimming pools I have ever come across , and just like everything at the hotel , it was designed in an effort to catch your eye and is without a doubt the star of the property.No matter where you look , the decor at Era Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property " sophisticated , luxurious and exquisite . Giant flower vases that resemble the Dutch-colonial style meet contemporary art and sleek furniture in the outdoor areas " one thing I loved about the resort was that all the common spaces were designed in a way that they had an open feel to it " wide open colonial doors and windows , or fully open terraces.Era Beach is so exquisite that they even offer a butler service , but I found the staff to be extremely discrete , always on call , yet never intrusive , adding to the elitist feel of the boutique resort.Under a few coconut palm trees right by the beach , eight sun beds are lined up , allowing you to look out at the ocean while relaxing and working on your tan . Because that 's about all you should be doing here : relax , recharge your batteries , chill out , and get a nice tan.The only time you might want to get out of your chair would be after the generous breakfast , to walk it off , so that you can order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach via a set of stairs and walk on the soft sand for at least a kilometer in either direction . You wo n't come across many people , only a few local fishermen and a small number of tourists from other nearby resorts . Following the beach to the right ( when facing the water ) would bring you to Unawatuna , a small nearby beach town , only a short 15-minute tuktuk ride away . <p> In Unawatuna , you 'll find everything you need from funky beach bars to tourist souvenir shops and Ayurveda centers.Theres not really any need to leave Era Beach , however : the food is absolutely divine and you can order lunch and dinner a la carte " the menu offers a mix of local cuisine and Western dishes in addition to the breakfast which is included in the room rate and comes with fresh fruit and yogurt , fresh breads and pastries and a full hot breakfast on top of it . You 'll be dining outside , on the covered terrace on either side of the pool , enjoying the sunset and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relax at Era Beach " if you are looking for a romantic getaway , tranquility , solitude and five star service , you will love Era Beach . <h> Stand out features <p> What makes Era Beach unforgettable is the exclusive and private feel that the resort has . The beautifully designed property , something that all Jetwing Hotels are known for , the excellent quality of food and service , and the breathtaking pool are what make a stay at Era Beach an absolute exhilarating experience . <h> Room for improvement <p> The Wi-Fi situation was not very satisfying for me . While a few of the other guests were able to connect to the Wi-Fi in some downstairs areas , I could only ever connect in the reception area , and that 's the last place you want to spend time in at this resort . Whenever I was online , the connection was still painfully slow . I hope this is something that can be improved , but I am saying that from a standpoint of someone who works while traveling . For people on vacation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and sometimes you need to be forced to let go . In an enchanting environment like Era Beach , you shouldnt be anywhere else but right there in the moment . <p> The other thing I thought could use some improvement were the bathrooms which were very big , but lacked in character . But then maybe that 's part of the minimalistic design . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142916 @2542916/ <h> Along the shores of Lake Titicaca : Discovering rural Bolivia on a 20km hike <h> A random encounter at the lake <p> When we met Don Hilario , we were dead tired . We had already walked 15 kilometers , at an altitude of 12,600 feet . This random encounter , ( which was n't so random after all ) , was exactly what we needed to keep us going for the last five kilometers of the hike . The old Bolivian campesino who lives right on the shore of Lake Titicaca does n't  get to see foreigners very often . So when he does , do n't  expect to be let off the hook any time soon . Our Lonely Planet guidebook , even though mostly unreliable in South America , was spot on in this case when it briefly mentioned you might run into an odd character named Don Hilario on the hike to Yampupata.Yampupata itself is not really a tourist destination , a sleepy village on the lake shore , which is why there are n't  many unknown faces passing through here . And even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , via a dusty dirt road , it is far enough to let you forget that you were anywhere near a larger settlement . Out here , the lake shore farmers and fishermen live pretty much the same way they did fifty years ago.Lonely Planet also mentioned that Don Hilario had a large collection of postcards from all over the world , which he would show hikers if they were lucky , and sure enough , after sitting us down on one of the reed boats that are typical for Lake Titicaca , he went into his little hut and returned with two hands full of postcards . We were grateful to sit and rest for a few minutes , so we eagerly read every single postcard he showed us , from places like Canada , the US , Holland , the Czech Republic , New Zealand and Germany.After admiring his postcard collection he offered us a ride in his new motorboat the reed boat in front of the house seemed to be purely for show these days but we decided to continue walking before wed loose the last remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four hours to get to Sicuani , the tiny village where Don Hilario lived , and it was our first warm-up walk for our five-day trek to Machu Picchu a couple of weeks later . We were both still recovering from sickness and had never hiked at such a high altitude , so we figured it was time to test our fitness levels.This hike , which we had found in the Lonely Planet , sounded just right for our first test run . It seemed to be mostly flat , so it would be a good way for us to ease into the high-altitude trekking . <h> The perfect day hike from Copacabana <p> I was also keen to get out of Copacabana , were we had based ourselves for a few days , because Copacabana turned out to be a town I did n't  care too much for , except for the fantastic lake views from top of the- Cerro Calvario mountain maybe . Lake Titicaca itself is the true attraction here , and not only because it is the highest navigable lake in the world , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the beliefs of the Inca , the creator god Viracoca rose up and create the sun and moon , stars , and the first human beings . This all took place on the appropriately named Isla Del Sol and Isla De La Luna , both only a short boat ride from Copacabana , and even closer from Yampupata . Isla Del Sol would be the place of our second warm-up hike.During the hike we barely met anyone . Every now and again a motorcycle would pass us , but if we did n't  pass through a village , we were on our own , aside from the odd llama or some sheep and pigs.Three kilometers into the hike , we passed a small set of Inca ruins , which we had to ourselves , and another two kilometers later we reached Chani , a small village where tourists from Copacanana who booked a boat ride on the lake were taken to experience a floating restaurant ( a tourist trap ) . Up to here , the road had been following the shoreline the entire time , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruins sat along the way , remnants of settlements that had been erected and left many moons ago . They added to the sinister atmosphere in this isolate place , making me wonder what it must have looked like here at the height of the Inca empire.We passed a religious shrine inside a cave , followed by a steady climb to the top of a hill . The altitude was hard to get used to and I felt like I was huffing and puffing more than ever before , walking slower than an 80-year old woman . When I reached the top , I was rewarded with views over the Camino Precolombino , and the road luckily went downhill again towards the water.Near the lake we reached the only bigger village after a few lone houses along the road . We were greeted by chickens , dogs , sheep and some farmers who were working their fields . Up until this hike , I did n't  have the best impression of Bolivians they did n't  seem overly friendly or welcoming , most of them seemed to see you only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country where people barely ever get to see foreigners , we were greeted with smiles , hellos , and in the next village over by the sweet Don Hilario.After waving goodbye to the old man , we had another uphill walk to make it through , and at this point we were fairly tired . My legs hurt , I was hungry , and I was ready to lay down.Once we made it to the highest point though , the fine views over the lake and the islands , the green fields and Yampupata below us made it all worth it . Now that I could see the end point , I felt a boost of energy run through me , and I knew I could do it.When we reached the village , we did n't  stick around long we could have taken a boat over to the Isla del Sol straight from here , but we wanted to hike across the entire island and knew that we needed more time ( and some rest before the next big hike ) . Luckily we found a taxi that was heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only half an hour later , we were back where we started.The achievement of the hike felt extraordinary and got me even more excited for the hike through the Andes to see the lost capital of the Incas , Machu Picchu . But up next was the mystical Isla Del Sol 129333 @qwx989333 <p> The walk was definitely longer and harder than expected- its more like 19 or 20 km , not 17 as I had read . The road was also much more hilly ( up and down ) than I had thought . <p> It took us a total of 5 hours to get to Yampupata ( incl short breaks and the 30-min chat with Don Hilario ) . <p> Pack snacks and water , as there are n't  really any shops along the way . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 8 Comments <p> I also found that the Bolivians in the more rural areas that did n't  see as many tourists were a lot friendlier . I did the Isla del Sol hike with a recently broken toe and although it hurt and took me double the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was worth it ! Stayed at the sweetest guesthouse , very simple but our hosts were very friendly and the small restaurant across the path had amazing stone oven pizza = <p> Loving your pictures of my favorite lake in the world . Personally I am not very good at taking pictures .. but on lake titicaca it is different . The extreme heights an the clear sky render all pictures into something diving . Oh .. and year you are right : taking things slowly once you arrived at Lake titica is a good idea . The hight takes its toll ! After two days I usually feel fit enough to do proper hikes , though ( still walking upwards takes a lot of energy . hihi ) 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

The ten-hour ride from San Salvador de Jujuy to San Pedro de Atacama travels through a seemingly endless stretch of no mans land , at one point the bus worked its way up around a grueling 72 switchbacks and the last hour or two the road cuts like a straight ( and steep ! ) downhill line all the way to San Pedro . It is here that we see the Atacama Desert ahead of us for the first time : a barren landscape at 2,300 meters ( 7,500 feet ) stretching as far as the eye can see . San Pedro itself sits on the official border between Argentina and Chile and just a few miles from the Chile-Bolivian border . <p> The Atacama Desert is a 600-mile-long ( 1,000 kilometers ) plateau in northern Chile , close to the borders of Bolivia and Argentina , barely populated , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barest and bleakest sceneries we have ever seen . <p> Looking at this harsh , yet captivating landscape , - - I can easily picture the surface of Mars looking exactly like this . The only word that comes to mind to describe this scene is otherworldly . <p> At times , dry shrubs and bushes cover the ground , but most of the time there is nothing but rocks and gravel . <p> As the bus descended down that consistently straight , steep road , we could n't help but wonder where San Pedro could possibly be . There are no signs of civilization for miles and miles " just the lunar landscapes of the Atacama Desert in all directions . <p> When we finally reach the village , we are surprised to see that is actually quite green a lush oasis in the middle of this desolated part of Chile . <p> San Pedro de Atacama has doubled its population to 5,000 people over the last decade , becoming more and more popular with travelers from all over the world , but also many Chileans who want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next few days in San Pedro , we explored the desert and discovered that there is much more than barren land here : we see dark blue lagoons , vast salt flats and salt mountains , a moon-like valley , a geyser field and sand dunes . <p> There are smoking volcanoes , canyons and gorges , hot springs and remote desert villages with houses made of volcanic rock for a desert , there is actually much more diversity than you might expect . <p> Of course much of the desert does indeed resemble Mars and not just the looks but the conditions as well . Water is extremely scarce and much of the desert is inhospitable not even bacteria can survive in some areas ! <p> What looks like snow in these pictures , is actually salt . Parts of the Moon Valley ( Valle de la Luna ) near San Pedro are made up of dry lakes , with salt covering the surface . <p> Several saline outcrops have been carved into naturally sculptured statues by wind and time . <p> The Three Marias , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of clay , salt , gems , gravel and quartz and is approximately one million years old . <p> Salt can also be seen on many of the red rocks in the Valle de la Muerte ( Death Valley ) of the Atacama Desert . Many of the rocks are coated in a white layer of salt originating from volcanic eruptions in the area . <p> This part of the valley is actually called Cordillera de la Sal ( Salt mountain range ) , and in addition to the salt-covered rocks , we spent time crawling through one of the many salt caves here . <p> The best time to visit the Death and the Moon Valley is the late afternoon , to see how the lights of the twilight hours change the colors of the mountains and sand dunes . <p> On one all-day tour , it was incredible to watch the landscape change from dry sand to deep volcanic lakes to the shallow waters on top of the salt flats , where hundreds of pink flamingos pecked their way across the water in search of food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are actually the third largest salt flats in the world , after the nearby Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia and the Salinas Grandes across the Andes in Argentina.The Chilean salt flats feel very different to the other two . Here there are more animals , it seems . Like those flamingosand the lizards and also the fact that instead of an almost blinding white salt , the salt flats here are made up of big chunks of grayish salt rocks and boulders sticking up out of the ground.A completely different side of the Atacama Desert are Laguna Miscantes and Mi+iques , two altiplano lakes at over 4,200 meters ( 13,800 feet ) . <p> Set next to each other in a spectacular mountain setting , the surrounding yellow grass and brownish mountains create a colorful contrast to the deep blue waters and clear azure skies.The lake shores are white due to the salt in the soil , adding yet another color.The crystal clear skies are one of the most famous features of the Atacama Desert on over 300 days of the year there are no clouds whatsoever .

From Santiago , this region is a 24-hour bus ride or a short flight into the nearby city of Calama and a 60-mile bus or minibus ride from there . 129336 @qwx989336 <p> It seems like Atacama Desert is a bunch of national parks combined into one : you have the geysers from Iceland ( or Yellowstone ) , the red rocks of Sedona , the salt-flats , and volcanoes .

@@107142920 @2542920/ <h> How much does it cost to travel in Sri Lanka ? <p> I spent five weeks traveling around Sri Lanka just before the main tourist season started , still enjoying the bargain deals of the low season and seeing prices go up in the high season this applies mainly to accommodation , however . I am breaking down all of my expenses in the country to give you an idea of what costs to expect when you budget for a trip to Sri Lanka . <p> Overall , it has been one of the cheapest countries I 've been to and it is possible to travel the country on $20 $30 per person a day ( on a shoestring ) , or around $50 per person per day in nicer accommodations . Read on for the full breakdown of food , transportation , sightseeing , accommodation and other costs . <h> Visa <p> A visa is required to enter Sri Lanka . Luckily it is easy to apply for a Sri Lankan visa online . The cost of a visa for Europeans , North Americans and Australians is US$35. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're planning to stay longer , you 'll have to get an extension in Colombo , which is LKR3,600 /US$25 ( make sure to have a passport photo on you for that ) . <h> Accommodation <p> This will be your biggest expense , but the value for money is usually very good . <p> The cheapest rates for a private double room I found was LKR1,500 ( US$10.40 ) , and in some of the beach towns I paid around LKR3,000-3,500 ( US$21-25 ) for a double room ( split between two people ) . Remember that this was in the off-season though . <p> In other places ( not along the coast ) LKR1,500 seemed to be the going rate for a basic double room , breakfast often included , and usually with free wifi . <p> As for higher end accommodation , I found some nice hotels with swimming pool and breakfast for LKR5,000-6,000(US$35-41) , and really nice hotels , like the Cinnamon Hotels around the island , often offer special rates starting at LKR7,000 ( US$49 ) during the low season ( expect this to double in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dorms but a dorm bed was usually around LKR800 ( US$5.50 ) . It definitely pays off to check hotel booking websites like Booking.com for special deals in the places you 're planning to visit . Through Booking.com , I found a nice boutique hotel in Colombo for $50 a night ( for two people ) , and a great deal for a gorgeous hotel in Polonnaruwa for $29 a night including breakfast . <h> Food &amp; Drinks <p> Food can be dirt cheap , but it also can be pricey depending on if you 're willing to delve into the local cuisine or stick to western choices . A Sri Lankan- dinner of kotthu , which is a favorite of the locals , costs around LKR165 200 ( US$1.15 1.40 ) , while a chicken curry in a beach town can cost you up to LKR900 ( US$6.25 ) . On average , expect to pay between LKR200 and 300 ( US$1.40 2.10 ) for local food and LKR600 to 900 ( US$4.15-6.25 ) for a dish in a tourist restaurant . Breakfast usually cost me LKR500 to 700 ( US$3.45-4.85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , if you are looking for good coffee , you 'll have to pay for it . The most expensive coffee I had was in Kandy at Natural Coffee , where I was charged LKR560 ( US$3.90 ) for a cappuccino more than I usually paid for an entire meal ! There are some coffee shops in Colombo , and some cafes around the country that have a proper espresso machine , but they 're few and far between . <p> Generally , you can expect to pay around LKR270 ( US$1.88 ) for an espresso and LKR350 400 ( US$2.40-2.80 ) for a cafe latte or cappuccino . Of course there are also the cheap roadside coffee vendors or the guys that walk through the trains with a big thermos , selling a brown liquid for 10 rupees ( US$0.07 ) , but I would n't call that coffee =If you prefer to stick to western food ( why would you though , because Sri Lankan food is seriously addictive ! ) , there are some western chains like Pizza Hut and KFC , and you can find sandwiches , burgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between LKR600 and 1000- ( US$4.16 -7.00 ) . You can splurge on fine dining in places often , the nicer hotels have on-site restaurants , and there you pay upwards of LKR1,000 ( US$7.00 ) for a dish . Snacks are super cheap local chocolate is LKR50 100 ( $US0.35-0.70 ) , a bag of cashew nuts is LKR120 ( US$0.85 ) , peanuts are LKR50 ( US$0.35 ) , and little fried lentil balls or donuts are 10 rupees ( US$0.07 ) . A vegetarian roti ( a dough triangle filled with vegetables basically like a samosa , but not deep-fried ) is 40 rupees ( less than US$0.30 ) and big enough to serve as a full meal cheapest lunch ever ! A bottle of water ( 1.5 liters ) is LKR60 70- ( US$0.40-0.50 ) , and since the tab water in Sri Lanka is not drinkable , you 'll have to budget for at least one bottle per day.Alcohol <p> A 625ml bottle of local Lion beer can be as cheap as LKR250 ( US$1.75 ) , but can cost you up to LKR600 ( US$4.15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( US$2.10 ) . Cocktails are more expensive about LKR400 to 500 ( US$2.80 3.50 ) along the beaches and LKR800 to 1000 ( US$5.50 7.00 ) - in the nicer bars of Colombo. - <h> Transportation <p> Transportation is some of the cheapest Ive ever taken anywhere in the world I still cant believe that a 7-hour train ride cost me a mere LKR230 ( $1.60 ) in 2nd class ! While I would n't opt for 3rd class ( those are the cheapest tickets but the carts are often overcrowded ) , I think 2nd class is perfectly fine and there 's no need to pay for 1st class , which is about 1000 rupees per ride and essentially the tourist cars . I will share more about that when I write about my Sri Lankan train adventures which deserve a post o their own . I usually paid LKR190 ( US$1.30 ) for a train ticket , the cheapest one was the 1 hour ride from Ella to Badulla which cost me 40 rupees ( just under 30 cents ) . Long distance buses are a bit more expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LKR80 ( US$0.55 ) - for a 1-hour ride . The most expensive ride was a 4-hour trip from Kandy to Polonnaruwa at 150 rupees ( $1.05 ) Tuktuks range anywhere from 50 rupees to 600 rupees ( or more , if you go really far in them ) , always negotiate before you get in . <p> The price they quote you is usually higher than what they 're supposed to charge you , so try to haggle . As a rule of thumb : anything up to 3 kilometers should n't be more than 100 rupees , but the more touristy the area , the higher the prices the drivers charge. - <h> Sightseeing <p> Tourist attractions are the most expensive category : Sri Lanka offers- its heritage sites and national parks at a steep price , unproportionally higher than anything else that 's sold at deflated tourist pieces . Tourists do n't  pay double or tenfold what locals pay , they pay around 40 times the local price . An example : Sri Lankans pay LKR50 ( US$0.35 ) - to enter Yala National Park , foreigners pay more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north are LKR3,250 ( US$22.50 ) - each , and a half day safari in a National Park comes to US$40 with the vehicle , park entrance and a guide , but you 'll most likely get quoted a higher price . For our jeep in Yala we paid LKR4,000 ( US$27.70 ) between four people and admission was around LKR2,500 ( US$17.30 ) - ( it gets cheaper the more people are in a group ) . You can rent bikes for the day to get around the ancient cities which cost LKR200 to 300 US$1.40-2.10 ) . Prices for other fun activities : A whale watching tour will cost you around LKR6,000 ( US$41.75 ) , a dive is around US$30 , surf lessons are around US$40 , cooking classes start at LKR3,000 ( US$21 ) . <h> Other expenses <p> Other expenses include things like laundry , toiletries and a local SIM card . Here are some examples so that you know what to expect : <p> Laundry : LKR250-350 ( US$1.75-2.45 ) per kilo <p> Shampoo/ conditioner 100ml : LKR150 180 ( US$1.05-1.25 ) <p> Face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : LKR399 ( US$2.75 ) for a 4GB data package <h> Local SIM card <p> Make sure to grab your free local SIM card right when you make your way through immigration at the airport . Dialog , one of the fastest 3G networks in the country , offers free SIM card at immigration just ask for one and theyll give it to you . I personally used mobitel and paid 399 rupees for a 4GB data package . If you add another 100 rupees for call time credit , that should last you a while ( if you only use your phone to call guest houses etc ) . <h> Some notes on money and ATMs <p> There are ATMs everywhere , at least one in each town , no matter how small it is . And cash is king it was rare that I was able to pay anything with a credit card , so prepare and make sure you 'll always have enough cash on you , especially when you visit national parks and UNESCO sites the only place I was able to use my card at was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of only 10,000 rupees , so if you pay fees for cash withdrawals abroad , make sure to avoid this one . Commercial Bank let 's you take out at least up to 20,000 rupees , if not more . Sampath Bank let 's you take out at least 30,000 rupees at once . <h> Tipping <p> Most places automatically add a service charge to the bill , so double-check before you tip if they 're already including it . <h> Per day breakdown <p> As you can see , Sri Lanka is very affordable not as cheap as India , but you can get by on an average $30 a day , if you stay in budget accommodation and do n't  take expensive tours every day. - A- beach- day with accommodation , two full meals , coffee , snacks and drinks at night in a beach town would cost me around $25 , but on days when I visited one of the UNESCO sites , my daily expenses could easily add up to $50. 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Dani , Thanks so much for such an informative post ! Lots of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and am most curious about mid-budget solo female travel experiences . You did n't  mention any major safety tips or thoughts ( aside from the obvious ) . Any pointers to that end that you may have left off of your blog ? Thank you ! <p> Oh I felt very safe in Sri Lanka as a female traveler ! I was only traveling by myself for a few days , then with another girl , but we were never harassed and I also felt less scared about being robbed there , compared to South America for example . I hope you 'll have the same great experience that I had traveling in Sri Lanka , Amber ! Enjoy = <p> This was very enlightening , Dani ! Ive been becoming increasingly curious about Sri Lanka , and I appreciate the details you provided regarding costs . I may have to check out that post about the trains . = <p> Hi Dani , Thanks for the great information ! We are thinking about going to Sri Lanka in November/December . Do you know anything about traveling there at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you were there at the beginning of this year . We are just a bit concerned about weather due to the monsoons but it seems like there is some rain somewhere all year round ! Thanks , Elizabeth <p> Hi Elizabeth , I did actually go in November and stayed until mid-December . My friend who stayed a bit longer told me that it got quite rainy on the West Coast during the last week she was there but I know that the weather can vary quite drastically on different sides of the island . But even if the monsoon hits while you 're there , that means 2 hours of heavy rains and you should be good for the rest of the day . But while I was there ( early Nov until 17 Dec ) the weather was wonderful ! ! Enjoy Sri Lanka , its one of my favorite countries ! ! = <p> hi dani. can you please advise which is better , to get tour package from travel agency or to make our own itinerary . We want to go to sigriya , elephant orphanage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the transportation ( train or bus or jeep ) <p> Hi , yes I was traveling solo at times , and at times with another female as two blondes . I have to say that when I was by myself , I never got harassed , and the two of us never had any problems either . I know that Kristin of BeMyTravelMuse also traveled solo in Sri Lanka , and I think she did n't  have any problems either . I found India much more challenging as a female traveler ; in Sri Lanka I never felt unsafe . <p> You are absolutely awesome ! ! ! I love getting a breakdown on costs as I travel generally on the cheap . Flying to Sri Lanka in a couple of days from Oman where I 've spent 6 weeks. , which is not the cheapest country so looking forward to a cheaper place again . <p> i 'm travelling the south coast of Sri Lanka for two weeks this July , how much do you think you spent in total ? one of the hotels is already paid for but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to take with me ? <p> Hi Abbie , like I said in the article , I spent $20 " $30 per day ( on a shoestring ) , or around $50 per person per day in nicer accommodations . But since your accommodation is already paid for and you 're traveling in the south , you should be fine with $30 a day . It does n't  seem like you 're going to visit the UNESCO sites which had a hefty price tag so the only pricier activities might be something like whale watching , surfing lessons or a visit to Yala National Park ? Put some extra cash aside for things like that , but transportation and food are dirt cheap . Enjoy Sri Lanka , and I 'd love to hear from you when you get back how much you ended up spending ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142922 @2542922/ <h> Quirky Chile : Coffee with legs <p> A few days before our departure from Buenos Aires , our friend Ashley emailed us her some recommendations for Santiago de Chile . Glancing through the list , there was one thing that caught my attention immediately : Coffee with legs . What is coffee with legs ? ! <p> Chile is truly a a conservative country , where not even ten years ago , divorce was still illegal , and until the early 2000s , many Hollywood movies were shown heavily censored . GLBT rights are still extremely limited as well . And yet , right on our very first stroll through downtown Santiago , we passed several of these legs establishments and when we worked up the courage to peek inside , it quickly became clear that they are much less creepy than we had imagined . The storefronts are wide open and not only men but also many women get their caffeine fixes around the counters . <p> There are no tables here , instead people sip standing around the counters surrounding the Italian-style coffee makers and old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soda water in Chile ) . The high walls are covered completely in mirrors , so that those would would like to can see the leggy waitresses no matter which side of the coffee shop they are facing . <p> The counter tops do n't  just leave the waitresses legs exposed , but all the customers as well . Perhaps Cafe con Piernas was meant more innocently at first that you would drink your cafe on your piernas ? Good guess , but not quite . <p> Considering its been almost 20 years , the idea definitely stuck ! Each of the Cafe con Piernas chains has a typical outfit that all waitresses wear , from classic black cocktail dresses to short flowered dresses , but always high heels . Having been a waitress myself for many years , I could n't imagine running around all day in these heels ! <p> Although Chilean women made a big uproar when these cafes- first appeared , furious that these coffee shops used mens fantasies to sell coffee , they seem to have mellowed significantly , as women were happily drinking coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The coffee itself is actually good , strong coffee and is so popular with the Chileans that each chain sells their own branded beans in the supermarkets here as well . <p> The most surprising aspect of these coffee joints is how much smoking is going on here ! Chileans seems to love to smoke , and drinking coffee in here felt like taking a trip in a time machine to the innocent times when no one knew smoking is not good for you ! <p> A local friend revealed that there are indeed much seedier versions of these cafes , where women wear bikinis ( or less ) instead of dresses and there is some sort of random happy minute where they remove their tops for anyone who happens to be there . These places tend to have closed doors and blackened windows , unlike the bright and airy cafes on the main drags throughout town . <p> The- Machismo ! outcry of the women is much clearer in these circumstances , and there are constant battles to have them shut down and we can definitely see why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be strangely beloved in modern day Chile and we loved discovering more about this unique and quirky- institution . 129336 @qwx989336 <p> I did go out of curiosity to one of the seedier Cafes con piernas ( and I do mean curiosity as a gay man neither verson is likely to titillate me ! ) . <p> There are many of them , and are mostly in the basements of shopping arcades . The one we went to , there were several in the same basement . <p> They do indeed have darkened windows , and the women wear very small bikini tops . But the atmosphere is still a very Chilean , conservative one it was far removed from similar , alcohol-fuelled go-go bars that youd find in Europe &amp; South East Asia . They were full of groups of Chilean men in suits chatting to the women over coffee . <p> I went in with a swedish , female tourist and a male peruvian . Interestingly no-one batted any eye at the presence of a female customer , and the Peruvian was incredibly shocked for all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow such a thing ! We chatted quite a bit to a few of the women working there over coffee , and the whole thing definitely felt less sleazy than I 'd been expecting . <p> Its funny because I feel like servers wearing short skirts in cafes and restaurants is common in many places all over the world , but it usually happens without anyone drawing attention to it as a tactic to draw in customers , and its rarely advertised blatantly . Its kind of cute that these cafes are making it into an actual thing . <p> To be clear : I 'm not saying there is anything wrong with this . I wish to make no moral judgements , just an observation <p> Perhaps both men and women are both exploited in little ways like this and perhaps that 's OK provided it does n't  go that far . <p> However , I would argue that this is exploitation . The simple fact that women are in there enjoying their coffee says more about the permissiveness of this kind of exploitation within a culture than it does about whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What would happen if one of these women were involved in an accident and one of her legs were replaced with a prosthetic ? Now , whether or not she was great at her job as a barista is irrelevant " she 's gon na get fired . <p> Her skills are n't  as important as the way she looks and the net effect is that the idea that a womens looks are more important than her abilities in the workplace become more prevalent in the culture , and that implied difference in the sexes when it comes to work " that extra hurdle that a woman has to overcome " is reinforced in everyone . <p> If you 're female , being good ai n't  enough , you 've got to look good too . <p> Again , there are probably plenty of sexist assumptions that I continue to make on a daily basis that no one but the most ardent feminist would ever see . Perhaps women are able to exploit me as a man in different ways in different parts of life to further their own aims , thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be judged on skills over looks , but maybe that 's simply because I do n't  look like George Clooney and , if I did , perhaps I 'd use that to get ahead too . <p> Simon , Simon , SimonI agree with you and then I do n't  and then I do again . I 'd argue that while this could be a low level of exploitation , by women also enjoying their coffee here it is not indicative of permissiveness but perhaps the opposite , taking it back , owning it . Entry into what was once an old boys club , perhaps , that is now open to everyone . And while you 're right about the prosthetic leg scenario , if I lost my hand I would n't be a very good blogger , either ( except I would n't fire myself , either , so there 's that hole in my analogy already ) . My point is that by the same rationale , manual laborers are also being exploited as if they lose legs or arms they wont be able to mine/dig/build either , no ? <p> Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're totally spot on , and I suppose the main reason why I participated in this situation ( besides the fact that my girlfriend thought this was AWESOME = ) is that it is a part of everyday Santiago culture and relatively low on the seedy scale as compared to models , actresses , strippers , etc . <p> ps you 're a ROCK star ( we saw that great post about your pre-nomad life , you know ) so you can use that to get ahead = <p> Wow , had no idea . At the same time , that 's just sort of a normal outfit in a lot of parts of the world , is n't it ? ? ? Its sort of a funny concept , definitely ai n't  no Hooters . ( Hooters has always pissed me off , I 'd NEVER go there , but this I 'd go . Maybe I 'm a hypocrite ? ) <p> Nah , you 're not a hypocrite at all . Its a tough call on a lot of levels , but really , look at how moderately these women are dressed in actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not breasts . Its not like this is called Coffee with Gams or some other sort of derogatory name . Its just coffee with legs . <p> I really dislike indoor places where people are smoking , I do n't  drink coffee , and I 'm not particularly interested in looking at womens legs , yet somehow , these places sound fascinating ! Looking forward to discovering some when were in Santiago ! <p> Great Post ! These places struck me as more of an oddity than sexualized sin spots . We did n't  visit any seedy ones , just the larger , tamer ones . For those , I felt it was fine . Everyone working there is an adult who knowingly applied to the establishment . And the requirements of the job are obvious from the start . Also , they 're legs . I think I 'll reserve my pearl clutching and smelling salts for something that actually warrants shock , not giggles . = <p> I used to study in Santiago and I remember walking by them innocently curious but never having the guts to enter . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But I imagine espresso would be better than instant coffee . BTW , was the recommendation from Ashley from The Middle Finger Project ? <p> I would n't have gone in by myself either I wouldve been way too embarrassed = The recommendation was from another Ashley , but we 've stumbled upon Ashley from The Middle Finger quite a few times recently ! ! = <p> Really ? ? Interesting ! We walked by one of the seedier ones in on one of the arcades around the Plaza De Armas when the door opened and it looked like the waitress in the bikini was giving someone a lap dance but everything happened so fast , we did n't  really see all that much . <p> Hmmm I got really surprised . I 'm from Chile and " coffee with legs " is something completely different . Or maybe the one you depicted in this entry is really a " coffee with legs " , and the places Ive seen are " almost-naked-coffee " , because Their doors are usually closed and the waitresses work wearing their undies . YES , underwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read a travellers blog . Stay safe , hugs n kisses ! <p> We had a private tour guide for one day in Santiago and he told us that the big chains ( Haiti , Caribe , etc ) are normal cafes- and we saw tons of women in there every time we went and every time we walked by them but that the ones in the galleries around the Plaza Central where you ca n't look inside are the sleazier versions you mention with string tangas and bikinis = He offered us to take us to one of them but we did n't  think they were appropriate for girls to visit = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142923 @2542923/ <h> Bogot+ , Colombia : A Pleasant Surprise <p> I 'll admit it : Bogot+ was the place I was the least excited to visit in Colombia . I even almost skipped it because I had read so many horror stories of muggings and I had n't  found any articles in which people were raving about the city . It seemed like most people were rushing through Bogot+ , hitting up the most important museums and moved on to the next place.There were only two reasons that made me want to go to Bogot+ : I had heard that it was the city with the best street art scene in all of Colombia and it happens to be home to El Theatron , the largest gay club in all of South America . I had to check it out , even though that meant leaving my hotel after dark , a thought I found somewhat daunting before I even arrived in Colombia 's capital.Once I got to Bogot+ , however , my fear vanished almost immediately . The day of my arrival I was already meeting friends in Plaza del @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood , which I had heard was n't very safe at night . Apparently this plaza is where the city was founded in 1538 , and the surrounding neighborhood with its still intact and well-preserved Spanish-colonial buildings quickly became my favorite neighborhood in town . It was a drastic difference from the shiny office towers in the Chapinero neighborhood , where I was initially staying . In La Candelaria , I found myself surrounded by small , one-story , colorful Spanish-colonial houses , there were still some cobble-stone streets , and there were several colonial churches . I could barely put my camera down on my strolls through the neighborhood ! What I found upon arriving in the plaza on that very first night was anything but scary " the square was filled with young people drinking beers and chicha ( more on that later ) that they had purchased in the nearby shops . The atmosphere was lively and joyful , and when I took a cab back to my hotel around 3am , I still did n't feel unsafe.The next morning , I started to explore the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the thick layer of grey clouds that would hover over the city on most days " blue skies were a rarity . The altitude " Bogot+ sits at 8,675 feet , 2,644m caused me to huff and puff my way up and down Candelarias steep streets , and I never got used to it during my two weeks in the city . Combined with cooler temperatures I could see why- Bogot+ did n't  fare well with most travelers especially when you were coming from sea level , tropical temperatures and perfect weather , like I did , coming from the Caribbean coast.I have to admit that I was n't too fussed about the parts of the city that were outside of La Candelaria , but I found this neighborhood so charming that I decided to move there from my hotel in Chapinero , despite the fact that I was told it was n't very safe.I much preferred the Spanish colonial houses in La Candelaria to the high rises of Chapinero and Los Rosales , and La Candelaria was also where the majority of Bogota ' amazing street art was . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that I love street art , and just walking through these colorful streets , which resembled an ever-changing , mural-boasting outdoor gallery , made me happy . There were also several good coffee shops and restaurants ( including a couple of vegetarian ones ) right in this area , which is all this nomad needs to be perfectly content.During my time in Bogot+ , I joined two free walking tours . The first one was a tour for which I had found a flyer in the hostel I was staying at and which made not only La Candelaria much more approachable to me , but also gave me plenty of insights on Colombian life , food , coffee and the complicated history of Colombia . It is run by Beyond Colombia , and I 'd especially recommend it for those who only have a couple of days in Bogot+.We started with a stop at a Colombian coffee place , sampling some exquisite Colombian coffee and learning about Coffee culture in Colombia , where for a long time , like in many coffee regions , the best beans used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee themselves , resulting in small independent coffee shops opening and thriving . Later on we stopped at a chicher+a , a bar where chicha is served , a fermented corn drink that was a ceremonial drink with the indigenous people as well as the Spaniards when they started colonizing Colombia . The drink ended up being prohibited in 1948 , believed to be the cause of a violent uproar , but made a comeback in the 90s " still not as popular as beer or other liquor , but students love it because it is cheap . We bought a bottle to share between our group , and while I did n't love it , I think it 's worth trying while in Bogot+ . For that , head to La Portal de Chorro near the foot of the alley with all the graffiti : Callej+n del Embudo ( between Calles 13 &amp; 14 ) . Beyond tales of chicha and Colombian coffee we wandered through the streets of La Candelaria and stopped at the main sights of the city , such as Plaza De Bolivar with Bogota 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended the tour with a game of Tejo , a game that is played in bars all over Colombia . The goal is to cause a noisy explosion by throwing a metal puck at little paper triangles filled with gun powder . I found this tour incredibly insightful " the sights we passed felt more like extras , the real star of the tour were the stories our guide told us , ranging from Colombian politics to Pablo Escobar to Gabriel Garcia Marquez ' poetry.If you have time , definitely check out the Museo De Oro , the Gold Museum , and if you are into art , the Fernando Botero Museum which is small but has some great pieces of Colombia 's most famous artist but also some pieces of his own collection , which contains a Picasso , Monet and a Dali and other famous artists . In total there are over 200 paintings and sculptures in a beautiful colonial building.A couple of days later I joined another tour " the excellent free street art walk . This tour gave me so much background information on the artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strolls around La Candelaria , the political messages in the pieces , and the most important artists " it was such a great tour that it ended up being one of my favorite 13 experiences in Colombia.Since 2011 laws against graffiti have been much more relaxed which is why the density of street art and murals is so high here now.During the tour I was introduced to the female Colombian street artist Bastardilla , whose massive murals cover several walls in Bogot+ , like this one:Another Colombian artist named Guache , who aims to remember Colombias past and whose colorful work usually features indigenous themes , was another great artist to learn about:Of course there was also more street art by Stinkfish , of whom I 'd already admired street art in Cartagena:And our group of street art fanatics also learned about Toxic+mano , a punk band turned street art crew , who are known to create pieces with strong political messages depicting topics like capitalism , inequality , poverty and corruption.I was excited to learn that there was another well-known female artist in Colombia , Lik Mi , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after our tour guide pointed out the kinky , kamasutra inspired stickers.And then there was Crisp , an Australian street artist who is currently based in Bogot+ , and whose incredible stencil pieces I kept running into after taking the tour.If you are interested in learning more about the artists behind Bogotas many graffiti and murals do yourself a favor and take this tour . It is free , tip-based , and leaves twice a day . I loved knowing the stories behind the various murals and who had painted them.When I was n't taking tours , I spent my days exploring museums , eating my way around the citys veggie restaurants , worked in coffee shops , and expanded my palate by trying local specialties such as hot chocolate which is served with cheese here ( and in some other regions of Colombia ) , or Changua , a breakfast soup with milk and eggs , or the ubiquitous arepas ( thick corn cakes ) topped with butter from one of the many street vendors.Another highlight was Monserrate Mountain , the famous mountain that looms over La Candelaria , 10,407- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17th century church that sits on its top , always visible from the city beneath . I had looked forward to hike up the mountain , which is a popular pilgrims ' walk , but at the time of my visit the trail was still closed off after a serial killer had murdered several women along the way . After hearing this , I felt much more comfortable taking the cable car ( COP14,000 /US$4,70 return ) up the steep mountainside , who needs a workout anyway =We had waited to visit the mountain until we had a sunny day with clear skies to enjoy the views over the city , which finally revealed how big Bogot+ really is " it is home to nearly 8 million people after all ! In my little bubble in La Candelaria Bogot+ seemed almost like a small town , and only the long cab rides to go out in other parts of the city indicated how enormous it actually was.On my last weekend in town , I ended up in the Chapinero neighborhood again , where I had started my Bogot+ adventure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find a number of bohemian bars and gay clubs , most importantly El Theatron , which is n't only the largest night club in the country but on the entire South American continent . The former theater accommodates around 8,000 party goers every Friday and Saturday night , who spread out over 5 floors and 13 different rooms , including a salsa bar , an R'n'B club a girls ' room and a boys ' room , and even an outdoor terrace . I could n't believe how massive this club was . The other thing I found unbelievable ? That we only paid COP40,000 ( which was around US$13.50 during the time of my visit ) , and not only did that got us admission , but it also got us free drinks until 2am ! When I left Bogot+ , I was happy I had taken the time to explore the city in more detail instead of rushing through , and do n't think it deserves the bad reputation it has . Of course I am saying this from the perspective of someone who has n't experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've read my thoughts on if it is safe to travel in Colombia you might remember that other people were n't quite as lucky and were robbed . If you visit Bogot+ " which you should " I recommend staying alert at all times , and to be safe , not to carry all your valuables around with you when you explore the city . Even on the tours I took I made sure only to take my phone and my camera out of my bag when I was using them . 129333 @qwx989333 <p> Where to stay <p> I loved Masaya Hostel in La Candelaria . I had stayed at their sister property in Santa Marta which I loved so much that I extended my stay to nearly a week there and knew I had to check out their Bogot+ hostel as well . It is a little pricier than other hostels ( double rooms start at COP90,000 / US$30 ; 4-bed- dorms are COP40,000 / US$13.50 ) but I was happy to pay more for the top-notch facilities and the great location ) . <p> Get around <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buses can be complicated to figure out . Taxis are cheap , best called via the EasyTaxi app . In rush hour taxis are in high demand " then , the higher the tip you offer via the app , the faster you 'll get a cab . Uber also operates in Bogot+ and is about 25% more expensive than a regular taxi . Apparently it is not recommended to just hail a cab in Bogot+ , but I only learned about the Easy Taxi App a couple of days before I left town and hailed cabs the entire time I was there without any problems ( one driver even ran after me when my iPhone fell out of my pocket and was left on the backseat ) . <p> Have you been to Bogot+ ? What did you think of Colombias capital ? I 'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments below ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 5 Comments <p> I was in Bogota this summer . I too enjoyed it but was thrown off by the horrendous traffic . We were staying in the Zona Rosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uber ride to La Candelaria even though it was about four miles away ! <p> Candelaria sounds like the place to be ! We skipped Bogota in our trip through Colombia only because we were so tired ( night buses are so exhausting ) and could n't find a cheap and quick way into town from the bus terminal . Reading this , I regret we did n't  push through . It was n't very high on our list back then . When we return to Colombia well definitely visit Bogota and Candelaria and the largest gay bar of course = Great tips and pictures ! <p> Hi there ! Finally ! Finally somebody else who liked Bogot+ ! = I have it completely the same way as you , I keep on only reading bad things about Bogot+ but I really enjoyed my time there ! And I did also feel pretty safe all the time there is only half as much cat-calling as in the streets of Havana which I support for 4 months , so just that was a plus = <p> I also really loves street art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how good quality the streett art in Bogot+ is . Unfortunately , I only found out about the street art tour the day I left ! So bad planning from my side ! Enjoyed reading your post and seeing your pictures ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142924 @2542924/ <h> Tequila , Art and Mariachis : Experiencing the Real Mexico in Guadalajara <p> Guadalajara was never on my travel wish list for Mexico , I admit it . The blank spots I 've been wanting to fill on my Mexico map are places like San Miguel Allende , Guanajuato , Copper Canyon and the beaches on the West Coast Puerto Vallarta , Sayulita , and San Pancho , all of which I 've been wanting to visit since reading about them on a bunch of travel blogs a few years ago , when several bloggers based themselves there for their winter escape.And that 's exactly how I ended up in Guadalajara : Its proximity to said beaches . I was looking for a place to fly to that had easy access to the coast , and which seemed worth exploring . Guadalajara sounded interesting enough : the cultural capital of Latin America in 2005 , a university town , a city with art museums and a historic city center , and a city with several Jose Clemente Orozco murals , one of the famous Mexican muralists whose art I adore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal ( $109 from LA , booked only three days in advance ) sealed the deal.My instinct had once again brought me to the right place . From my very first stroll through the historic center , I was much reminded of Mexico City and you all know how much I love Mexicos capital.Most streets of the historic center with its beautiful well-preserved , colorful Spanish-colonial buildings were lined with trees , there was more street art than I expected " and it was among the best Ive seen in all of Mexico , and the museums were indeed as world-class as the travel guides promised.I had only two nights booked in Guadalajara , but I quickly decided to make a week out of it . Three days in a city of over four million people were just not enough.Guadalajara is actually made up of three cities : Guadalajara , Zapopan and Tlaquepaque . The historic center with its imposing cathedral in the center was where I spent most of my time , and the four plazas that surround the cathedral , laid out in the form of a cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire country . After dark is when the plazas really come to life , with food stalls setting up , entire families gathering and having a snack , and young couples making out on the benches everywhere.The cathedral itself is well worth a visit , a massive structure which took 50 years to complete ( construction started in the 1560s ) and whose architecture is an interesting mix of Gothic , Neoclassical and Palladian styles . The gothic twin spires in particular give the cathedral a unique look " the third set of towers built after the two previous ones fell during earthquakes.Even though the historic center and the surrounding neighborhoods are walkable , I was happy when I discovered the city had a shared bike system , Mi Bici . I downloaded the app to see where the stations were , paid 80 Pesos ( US$3.92 ) for a 24-hour rental with free rentals for up to 30 minutes , which is common for most bicycle shares I 've used , and off I went . ( I later discovered that a 3-day rental for MXN$160/US$7.84 would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still very cheap ) . I biked around the center , took the bike over to the Plazuela De Los Mariachis , a little square that is dedicated to one of the city 's most famous inventions Mariachi music originates in Guadalajara . Similar to Mexico City 's Plaza Garibaldi , several mariachi bands were hanging around here , possibly waiting to play for potential customers who are looking for a mariachi band for a wedding or another event , but also to serenade customers who were eating in the restaurants around the plaza ( for a tip , of course ) . I also biked over to Avenida Chapultepec , a wide boulevard lined with restaurants and bars , an area that did n't seem like much during the day but which came to life at night when Guadalajara 's students and twenty-somethings filled the trendy bars in and around Avenida Chapultepec , as I 'd learn a few days later when a group from our hostel made our way over there on a Friday night for some drinks . Of course I found here , like everywhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the menu.The bike came in especially handy when I wanted to visit the Museo de Arte Zapopan , a modern art museum which is located in the Zapopan part of town . It was a welcome excuse for me to check out that part of town , which I might not have gone to otherwise , because it was pretty far from the historic center , where I was staying.The museum turned out to be one of those contemporary art museums that made me think several times Really ? This is art ? ' , and it was much smaller than I expected , but the architecture in Zapopan and the striking Basilica Nuestra Se+ora de Zapopan , which dates back to 1730 , made up for the slightly disappointing museum ( which luckily had free admission . I would 've regretted paying for it , I think ) . I much preferred the Museo de las Artes de la Universidad ( MUSA ) in the center of Guadalajara , which did n't only win me over with some impressive pieces of art , but also with its auditorium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage as well as the inside of the auditorium 's dome . Both murals depict , typical for Orozco , social injustice and resistance against the system.Another art space in Guadalajara that should n't be missed is the Hospicio Caba+as , one of the oldest and largest hospital complexes in the Americas , and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997 . Orozco painted the domed chapel of the 19th-century neoclassical hospice complex 57 frescoes cover the walls and the ceilings . It is one of his masterpieces.But art in Guadalajara does n't stop there : In recent years , Guadalajara has become more and more of a hub for young artists from all parts of Mexico and beyond . Art galleries have been popping up around town , and a residency and alternative cultural education organization supported by the State of Jalisco 's Ministry of Culture and the Instituto Cultural Caba+as , PAOS ( Programa Anual de Open Studios ) , has been attracting artists from all over the world . The program offers a month-long residency at the Museo Taller Jose Clemente Orozco , the former residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street art which fills entire building walls and doors . Even on the colonial houses the art never appears disruptive , but rather adds to the crumbling facades . I stumbled upon a new great piece every day on my wanderings around town , one of the best murals was right outside the MUSA Art Museum:While I did n't fall in love with any of the foods I tried in Guadalajara ( and admittedly , sometimes struggling to find a vegetarian option on the meat-focused menus ) , I thought the tortas ahogadas , which translate to drowned sandwiches ' " and they are in fact drowned , in sauce " were quite delicious , albeit messy to eat . They are usually stuffed with meat but I found several places that offered vegetarian versions . Guadalajara 's most famous dish is Birria , a stew that is made of goat meat , roast chiles and spices " if you 're a foodie and would like to try it , check out one of the birrierias in town.Guadalajara does n't have a typical drink , but it is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink originates that almost everybody visiting Guadalajara takes at least a day trip there : Tequila . Of course you can also get it in every single bar in Guadalajara , but after seeing photos of vast fields filled with blue agave plants in a travel article a while back , I wanted to see the little town for myself , and most importantly : take a distillery tour.I am not the biggest fan of tequila ( the thought of tequila usually brings back memories of too many tequila shots in my early 20s , complete with licking salt off my hands and finishing the shot with sucking on a slice of lemon ) , but I thought that a distillery tour and a tasting of some higher end tequilas might change my mind.A few other people from the hostel also wanted to visit Tequila , and so we decided to head there together on what turned out to be a pretty rainy Saturday . Saturday is the only day that the Tequila Express runs , a train that goes from Guadalajara to Tequila , solely for tourists , complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once we saw the hefty price tag ( MXN$1,200 US$59 ) , read some lukewarm reviews and found out that we would n't even get to see the town itself , only a distillery , we opted for the more economical way to get there : taking the bus.What was supposed to be a 90-minute trip turned into a two hour journey , and when we finally reached Tequila , we were starving . We decided to get some food before finding out how to hop on a distillery tour , of which there are many in the little town , including well-known tequila producers such as Sauza , Tequila Herradura , Jose Cuervo , Cofradia and the El Llano Distillery.Several touts approached us , trying to sell us their tour , and we finally agreed to join one that left an hour later , which cost MXN$180 ( just under US$9 ) , leaving us enough time to grab lunch , and maybe see a little bit more of Tequila.Strolling through the streets of the village made me wish I would 've come for an overnight stay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with souvenir shops and restaurants . Tequila itself is beautiful , but I think I would 've enjoyed the village more after the crowds had left and the tequila barrel-shaped vehicles that brought visitors to the distilleries had also left for the day , enjoying a quiet evening on one of the benches in the town square.With its colorful Mexican houses , an 18th century stone church and leafy plazas it deserved being included in the list of Mexico 's Pueblos Magicos , towns around the country that offer visitors a magical ' experience because of their natural beauty , cultural riches , or historical relevance.Thanks to Tequila 's significance in producing Mexico 's most famous export , Tequila and the surrounding area have also been given UNESCO World Heritage Site status . For most people , a day trip is probably enough , but I would 've also added an extra day to check out another distillery , because there are so many in and around Tequila , which is why the region also likes to promote itself as the Tequila Trail ' " think Mexico 's answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only time for one . The tour we 'd been sold was for the Orendain Distillery , a family-run , award-winning tequila producer which was founded by Don Edwardo Orendain Gonzalez in 1926 . It was fascinating to learn more about the production of tequila , a drink I knew literally nothing about , other than that it is produced from the agave plant . But which part of it ? During the tour , we learned that tequila is made from the pi+a , the heart of the agave , which , once the spikey leaves have been removed , indeed looks like an oversized pi+a ( Spanish for pineapple ) . It takes 8 to 10 years until the agave can be harvested though " the tequila business sure is a long-term investment . The companies who were smart enough to extend their Blue Agave fields a decade- , however , are now the ones that benefit from the growing popularity of high-end tequilas inside and outside of Mexico.Distilleries here proudly serve 100% agave ' tequila " this is what you should look out for , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the 100% pure tequilas do n't cause hangovers , if enjoyed in moderation.The tour of the distillery was highly informative and shows visitors pretty much the entire process of tequila making : first , the pi+as are roasted in an oven , then , the sugar is extracted and fermented for 7 to 12 days , and lastly , the tequila is distilled ( usually twice ) , which means ferments are separated by heat and steam pressure.There are three different types of tequila : Blanco ( bottled immediately upon distillation ) , Reposado ( aged for at least two months ) , A+ejo ( aged for at least a year , but less than three ) and sometimes there is a fourth one , Extra A+ejo ( over-aged ) . We get to try the main three types during our tasting and are surprised how different the tequila tastes from the mediocre stuff we 've previously tried . Especially the A+ejo , which is smooth and tastes more complex.We are in good spirits as we walk through the pouring rain back to the bus station to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : coming to Tequila was eye-opening in many ways . The three of us agreed that we 'd all been converted to Tequila drinkers , each of us carrying a small bottle in our bags , to enjoy back home . 129333 @qwx989333 <p> Where to Stay in Guadalajara <p> I first stayed at a B&amp;B , which I did n't love , and decided to move to a hostel with great reviews that I had found on Booking.com . I made the right decision : Hostal De Maria , in a converted old mansion , was in an excellent location in Plaza Col+n . It has private rooms as well as dorms , a beautiful colonial-style courtyard , lovely colorful decorations and breakfast is included . Double rooms are US$20 , a bed in a 6-bed dorm is US$9 . <p> La Bottega " If you love coffee , you have to stop at La Bottega , where I had the best coffee in Guadalajara . A small independent coffee shop that uses Mexican coffee beans . <p> Where to Drink in Guadalajara <p> The Guadalajara Pub Crawl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most popular drinks of the region and an introduction to some cool bars is something I would check out next time I 'm in town . Since this tour only runs on Fridays and I had already made plans for that night , I could n't take this tour during this trip . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107142926 @2542926/ <h> Costa Rica on a Shoestring <p> Costa Rica is the gem in Central America 's tourism crown : lush , green jungles , wild animals , breathtaking beaches and a well-developed infrastructure make a trip to Costa Rica as easy as it can be adventurous , suitable for many different types of visitors . The level of development , however , has also raised prices on goods and services , hotel rates and transportation to a level that most budget travelers ( falsely ) believe to be out of their range . It is certainly easy to plow through some serious cash here , but with a bit of planning ahead , Costa Rica can be nearly as inexpensive as its neighbors . <p> Many travelers we met along the way spoke with disdain about Costa Rica being over-priced and too expensive " those who were the most outspoken on the topic had opted to skip the country altogether . Since I had lived here for a year back in the day , there was no question that we would travel through . What we intended to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time , our Costa Rica travel budget ended up to be less than both our Guatemala and Nicaragua budgets , coming in at just under $27 per person per day ( based on two sharing accommodation ) . Read on for a few simple tips on how to travel through Costa Rica on a shoestring budget . <h> Take the bus <p> Taking private shuttles or taxis to get around can easily eat through your budget , but this can be easily avoided by taking the bus . The bus system in Costa Rica is organized , and the buses are safe , comfortable and nearly at a North American standard . The chicken buses ( old American school buses ) seen throughout the rest of Central America are few and far between here . The buses run between all the major towns and on schedule , and while a private shuttle can easily cost from $40 to $75 , a local bus charges less than $10 for the same route . <h> Eat at a Soda <p> Found everywhere throughout Costa Rica , a soda ' is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a menu of typical Costa Rican fare , mainly in various forms of casados : a huge plate of rice , beans , red and white cabbage salad , pasta and meat , or extra vegetables for vegetarians . While a restaurant in a tourist spot often charges between $10 and $15 per person per meal , the price of a casado ' varies between $2 and $7 , depending on the casado you choose and the place you are at " sodas in a tourist destinations obviously charge much more than in cities like Heredia or Liberia . <h> Drink Tap water <p> Unlike the rest of Central America , drinking the tap water in Costa Rica is perfectly safe . If you have been traveling throughout the region , you might think only a crazy person would fill up bottles with tap water , but the water in nearly every Costa Rican town is drinkable ( ask at your hotel/hostel if you 're unsure ) . With bottled water costing between $1 and $3 a bottle , refilling your own bottles will save you a hefty sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the bar <p> At $2.50 $3.50 a bottle in most bars , beer in Costa Rica can quickly eat through your daily budget . Of course in a country with so many relaxing beaches , sometimes a beer is a must . Plan ahead and grab yourself a few cold cans at a local shop for half the price and enjoy your beers on the beach just a few meters past the beach bar itself . <h> Book a trip for the Off-season <p> Costa Rica is a popular tourist destination for North Americans and Europeans alike , and prices shoot up during Holidays , Christmas and between January and March . Planning a trip to Costa Rica during the low season , May to November , can save you as much as 50 per cent on hotels and flights . The low season is also partially the rainy season , but with the exception of a few rainy weeks , downpours usually only last a couple of hours in the morning and the sun shines for the rest of the day . <h> Opt for a hostel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dingy twelve-bed dorm room , and not only are hostels cleaner , brighter and more affordable than ever , most also offer private double rooms for a fraction of what a hotel costs . We stayed in countless small hostels , run by people who care about their guests and take pride in offering a cozy , clean place to stay . Some hostels even offer a swimming pool , a bar , a lounge , books , board games , and free breakfast . You are also more likely to meet other travelers at the bar or in the common areas , whereas most hotels have a much more anonymous feeling to them . A private room in a hostel costs between $20 and $30 per couple , whereas a hotel room runs from $50 upwards . <p> Budget Travel Tip : With such a well-developed tourism industry , National Park tours and adventure activities in Costa Rica are usually very much worth the money , so make sure to budget in $15 $75 per tour during your time in the country .

Its easy to pay $15 per person per meal , but often if you just walk up the street to a soda , you 'll get great food for $4 . Let us know if you need any tips if you do decide to go ! <p> It really can , Kelsey . People get so caught up sometimes in being tourists that they forget that a good chunk of the population get by on very little , so there are ways to keep the costs down . As we said , we spent less here than in Nicaragua and Guatemala , just by being careful like this . Thanks for stopping by ! ! ! <p> Yes ! It seems that many people forget that you can always live like a local to keep costs down . That 's what I do whenever I travel , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no reason that you should ever *have* to spend more to live somewhere than the locals do . <p> Exactly , the only time you have to spend more is because you see more sights in a shorter period , short-term accommodation is more expensive than paying long-term rent ( unless you couchsurf or housesit ) , and sometimes , you make mistakes/get lost/dont know the cheapest option , but why do people forget that locals do n't  spend loads so you do n't  have to either ! ! <p> If were looking for a place with the nicest beaches ( beautiful , calm , not too cold , unpolluted , etc. ) , and the most charming , relaxing and affordable beach towns , what would be your favorite places to recommend in Central America or Mexico ( if you 've been ) ? <p> We were thinking of going to Sayulita , Mexico , but the Sayulita beach is a bit rough and cold . And the sand cuts your feet ! <p> Now you 've got me thinking that perhaps Costa Rica or Nicaragua would be even better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibe , no big hotels or chain restaurants or high buildings , etc . We liked Yelapa and Sayulita ( both in Mexico ) , but the water/beach itself was a little rough/cold in both places . Playa del Carmen beach ( in Mexico ) was also a little rough and cold for me . Your description of one of beaches on Isla Mujeres sounded lovely ( ankle deep and shallow , etc . ) . Is there a steep drop off at any point , or can you submerge yourself easily ? <p> Hi , this website is really helpful . Thank you for puttin git up . I have a quick question . Is it possible to book local bus tickets in advance and if so how far in advance should I book them ? I 'm planning on going to Costa Rica in November and I 'm trying to figure out if this is something I need to worry about . I do n't  want to get stranded somewhere . <p> Hello , thanks a lot ! I do n't  think you need to worry about pre-booking your bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that online , except for the Pan-Central American routes like Ticabus . We usually went to the bus station a day before our planned departure and bought our tickets , and that was enough . And at times we just showed up for the bus and we also always got a seat . Enjoy Costa Rica ! <p> Try San Juan del sur and all the beaches in Nicaragua . That particular beach has been discovered but Nicaragua is definitely less touristy than Costa Rica . If you are doing Costa Rica skip the very American and touristy North Pacific and listen to what the girls say , head South for Nosara and especially Samara , where Ticos go . I especially recommend taking a ten dollar local bus from San Jose going to Cahuita . You should especially visit with a guide , The Gandocco Manzanillo park near the Panama border . The hike there was definitely the highlight of my whole trip . I LONG ... And so many other wonders like the coral islands off the coast . <p> Hey Jess !

I am travling alone , and have the latest lonley planet guide book . I am starting to get very nervous because most places reviewed are beyond expensive . Usually they mention loads of budget places . Any thoughts ? ? <p> Hi Misty , did you have a look at the places we reviewed in Central America ? Most of them were pretty reasonable , even though Costa Rica is a little bit more expensive but you can still find good deals . Try to look on Hostelbookers.com for some special offers ( they also have guesthouses on there , not only hostels ) . Some of the cheapest places we found were Costa Linda Backpackers in Manuel Antonio and Cabinas El Pueblo in Monteverde , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Carribean coast .

Were trying to avoid the price hikes in CR later in the month and also avoid some of the rain . <p> I have seen some reasonable accommodations on AirBnB and think I may go that route for places to stay in San Jose Monteverde and the Pacific Coast . <p> here 's my question , you mention buses . Are these pretty safe ? What are the alternatives for getting around the country for 8 or 9 days ? Also , my GF speaks fluent Spanish , if that helps . I keep wondering if we should rent a car . Not sure what to do . <p> Another question , she wants to take beginner surfing lessons . I have read that Dominical is the place to go for that . Do you agree or have other suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing what you do . <p> Hi Ramona , great to hear you 're heading to Costa Rica ! Its a great time of year to visit , and like you say , just before the high season prices start = The buses are all very safe and relatively comfy . WE know that sometimes there are pickpockets on the inner city buses , so we were usually very careful and had all our valuables not within reach for anyone . Its a good question about buses vs. rental cars we did both , and loved the freedom the car gave us ( there was n't even a decent bus connection from Samara to Arenal , so we basically had to rent a car ! ) but it was pretty pricey compared to the buses . If $$$ is not an issue , I 'd probably prefer renting a car . You might find a good deal through one of the car hire websites ( BookingBuddy.com or the likes ) right at the airport . Your girlfriend speaking Spanish will definitely help ! Dominical is known to be a good surfers spot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places along the Pacific are good surf spots though depending on where you go , you might want to hit up a couple of them ?

And what 's the easiest way to get from Samara to Arenal via bus ? I noticed you mentioned there 's no direct bus .

Is there anything to do around where were staying or should we suck it up and make the drives ? Well be in Quepos for a week . <p> Thanks so much , Hannah ! Quepos is a bit of a tourist trap , yes . I would n't recommend visiting the National Parks on daily drives they 're just too far away . If you 're planning to see some more of Costa Rica I 'd recommend driving up the coast , maybe stop at another beach in Guanacaste ( Samara or Montezuma ) , then drive north to Monteverde to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the airport from there . We negotiated free airport drop-off with our car rental company the last time we were in CR , but we were there just before high-season , so we were in a better position to negotiate . <p> I have been considering a trip here for a while now and reading this has made my mind up ! I will be flying from the UK so the biggest expense for me is the actual flight , but my budget for 2 weeks would be around $750-1000 , which looks like would actually go quite far . I like to budget backpack , stay in hostels , camping and love street side food . I 'm considering going in June before the rainy season kicks in , but also off season , so its good to see that it is cheaper around that time too . Thanks for the advice ! <p> Hi Caroline , your budget for two weeks sounds good to me definitely doable ! You should be able to do it for $750 but its nice to have a little cushion . Enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with anything else = <p> We lived in Nicaragua for six years ! Much cheaper than Costa Rica , the way CR was twenty years ago . Nicaragua is charming , affordable , adventurous and authentic ! We blogged about our lives there for six years . <p> Have you checked our Costa Rica Hotel section ? There , we feature our favorites in Monteverde , Manuel Antonio , Samara and a couple of other places . I usually use Booking.com to see which hotels are inexpensive but well rated ( ideally above 8 ) and have a sale .. you might be lucky with sales since you 're not traveling in high season . Private rooms at hostels will probably be the cheapest option = Enjoy Costa Rica , Isaac ! <p> Hi Danny ! Love your informative blog . I 'm flying in to San Jose and am trying to hit rio celestial , I know its a long way to it , would it be cheaper to rent a car or what other options would you recommend ? Thanks in advance ! <p> Hi Ruby , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rio Celestial . I know that some areas of Costa Rica are not very well connected by bus and it makes sense to rent a car , but if you can find a bus that goes there from San Jose itll definitely be cheaper than a car rental ( car rental prices are en par with US prices , while the buses cater to locals ) <p> Hi , I 'm planning to go to Costa Rica for five nights max in November . I 'm traveling solo . I asked an online travel planner for a budget and was charged USD1200 , including airport transfers to Liberia airport but not including meals . Is this too much ? <p> Too much , Eva ! ! You can definitely travel for less . Pick up a Lonely Planet or another guidebook for Costa Rica and itll have all the information you need how to get from A to B , recommended hotels , etc . Seriously Eva you can do it for much less than $1200 . I recommend going into an actual bookstore and look through the travel guides before buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> Thanks so much ! I think you 'll love Cahuita ( there 's also a lovely National Park right by the ocean there ) and the tiny village of Manzanillo , which is very close to the Panamanian border . Limon itself is about an hour north of Cahuita and is a rather ugly port town . In between Cahuita and Manzanillo you have Puerto Viejo , the most touristy town on Costa Ricas Caribbean coast . There are buses from San Jose straight to Puerto Viejo . I think they stop in Cahuita along the way , we got off the bus there . Puerto Viejo might be a bit too touristy for you but there are plenty of places where you can rent bicycles for long bike rides along the coast , and there is a jaguar rescue center nearby with lots of wildlife . I think you might also want to check out the Sloth Sanctuary north of Cahuita . <p> There are so many great options there for all budgets ! We stayed in a gorgeous hotel while we were there but we met people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a budget . Eating at local spots is a great tip so much good , fresh local food to be had without breaking the bank ! <p> I totally agree with all of these , its very well known how the travel costs for Costa Rica increased and that discouraged a lot of travelers . Great job sharing these tips , this will definitely help a lot of travelers feeling a bit reluctant to go due to the costs . Its still possible to stay on budget , my best bet is to stick with locals ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

I also road tripped through the Southwest , visited Dallas for the first time , and spent time with some amazing people . Overall , a great month . <h> May Highlights <p> Spending nearly a month in Austin <p> Austin had been on my travel wish list for a while , but I always knew that I wanted to dedicate some time to exploring the city , not just a long weekend . After all , Austin is known to be a foodie city and I had more restaurant and bar recommendations than I could possibly check out in a month , let alone a weekend . And so I did n't  have to think long when a housesitting opportunity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad that I spent so much time in Austin it quickly became one of my favorite cities in the US , and I even could see myself returning for a longer stint ( although I feel like I 'm cheating on NYC just by saying this out loud ! ) . You can read all the things that made me fall for Austin here : Polaroid of the week : Wonderfully weird Austin <p> First time SUPing <p> I had several people come visit me in Austin which meant : a good excuse to do a lot of sightseeing . We kayaked on the river , checked out some museums , hiked in the Barton Creek Greenbelt ( basically a forest area in the city with lots of hiking trails ) , bar hopped our way through Austins nightlife districts , sampled food trucks , went on a wine tasting trip to the Texas Hill Country , watched the flight of the bats , and saw live music . But my favorite thing ? Finally going stand-up paddling , something I 've been wanting to try for a while now . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is something I 'll be incorporating more often into my travels from now on , and I 'm already contemplating where I could try it out on the ocean ( which I feel will be much harder than on the calm Colorado River in Austin ! ) . I think that this could happen in California later this year . And then : SUP yoga . Okay , who am I kidding here .. I do n't  think I have a good enough balance for a headstand on a paddle board , but who knows . <p> Road tripping through the Southwest <p> I was supposed to fly from Tucson to Austin , but at the very last minute , the opportunity for a road trip with a travel buddy arose , and of course I jumped on it . We decided to break up the long drive ( 900 miles ) into three days : to White Sands , New Mexico on the first day , Big Bend National Park the second day to hike the Santa Elena Canyon Trail , and then the remaining distance to Austin on day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as planned ( see What Went Wrong below ) , it was a fantastic road trip . I love the barren scenery of the Southwest , returning to White Sands was everything I hoped for , and I had great company which was important , especially on the long drag of the I-10 from El Paso to Fredericksburg , which does n't  have any road side attractions and is apparently the most boring part of the I-10 ( which runs from coast to coast ) . <p> Returning to White Sands <p> I loved the white dunes of White Sands when I visited this desert in the south of New Mexico in 2013 , and I loved it the second time around , too . Even though I 'd been here before , the dozens upon dozens of dunes , the bright white sand , the solitude and tranquility of this place everything had me in awe again . And this time around , I got to experience two things I missed out on when I came here during my New Mexico road trip I got to sled down some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset . Would I visit White Sands a third time ? Absolutely ! <p> Exploring Dallas <p> If you read last weeks Polaroid , you already know that Dallas was n't really on my list of must-see places , but I am not one to turn down an opportunity to check out a new city , and so I found myself in Dallas for a weekend and pleasantly surprised by the city ! Dallas , as it turns out , is way cooler than I thought itd be , and I regretted immediately that I had n't  allowed more time for my visit . I loved especially Deep Ellum , a trendy neighborhood with clubs , bars and great restaurants , and I hope I 'll get the chance to return one day to explore more of Dallas . <h> What went wrong <p> Road trip fail <p> We were on our way to Big Bend National Park on Day 2 of our road trip , had finally left the quite boring I-10 and were driving towards the Mexican border when on the completely deserted road a Prada Store appeared on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere ? ! It had been about twenty minutes since we even saw the last house ! Of course we had to stop to photograph the store . And that 's when I realized that my camera bag was n't in the car . We had driven for three hours from Las Cruces and were two hours from Big Bend . I knew exactly where I 'd seen the bag the last time : Under the desk in our hotel room in Las Cruces . Shoot . What to do ? ! <p> The Prada store in the middle of nowhere <p> In the end , we decided to drive the three hours back to Las Cruces , because a ) I did n't  want to go to Big Bend without my camera gear and b ) I was afraid that my gear would get damaged or lost in the mail if i asked the hotel to ship it to Austin , and I had just replaced my lens that broke after the attempted robbery in Mexico City last month . And so we drove back to Las Cruces , on the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , for the third time , the next day . Oh well .. I guess it could have been worse , and luckily we discovered it not only in Big Bend , which would have meant a five hour drive back to Las Cruces . <p> However I kept thinking how lucky I was to not have lost all of my camera gear this could have ended much worse than with an additional 6 or 7 hours in the car . <p> A broken screen <p> You might have noticed by now that I 'm just not very good with electronics .. I lose them , I break them , I washed them ( a USB stick , not too long ago ) , and this month it was the screen of my beloved iPhone that had to stand in for this category . My phone falls .. often .. But this month , I finally managed to break the screen ( something I had n't  done in a while ) and not just crack the screen , but really break it . <p> Ouch . <p> Emotional roller coaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Or to borrow Taylors words : Heartbreak is the national anthem , we sing it proudly. That song was playing a lot on the radio this month and I could relate well to this line . <p> Financial struggles <p> I do n't  want to go into detail here either , but let 's just say that the life of a freelancer is not always as glamorous as it might seem . I get to travel a lot , yes , but trust me , I do n't  make a lot of money , and this month was a tough one . <h> What 's next for me <p> An unexpected change of plans <p> I am only spending a few days in NYC before I 'm flying to Germany ! I had no plans to visit my home country until October , but a sudden turn of events is bringing me back to Europe for a while . Unfortunately I cant talk about the details just yet , but I hope I can she 'd some light on the recent events in next months round-up or in July at the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I am not exaggerating here . <p> Of course I 'm super bummed out about missing on some fun in the sun in NYC ( yall know by now how much I love my New York summers ) but 1 ) I hope I 'll be back stateside soon and 2 ) its not the last time that there 's summer in NYC and 3 ) I already have a pretty packed calendar for Germany , and one confirmed visitor for a week of fun in Berlin , a place that I also happen to love in the summer ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 5 Comments <p> Good afternoon Dani This was my first reading this review and I enjoyed every single word .

I think you did the wise thing going back for your bag not telling how your camera would have ended up in the mail or how long it would have taken to get it back . = <p> There are n't  a lot of people who make it down to White Sands , it seems ! But is n't it a gorgeous place , Kati ? I hope I 'll make it back to Big Bend one day got ta repeat that road trip from Tucson to Austin luckily I have friends in both cities , so it might actually happen = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142930 @2542930/ <h> Lisbon on Wheels " Get Out and Ride ! <p> Portugals capital city took us completely by surprise when , after booking a three-week stay on a whim , we ended up enamored by Lisbons allure . Unlike other European capitals , Lisbon balances its role as a cosmopolitan capital and once-commanding role in global maritime history with endless stretches of sandy beach and cool ocean breeze for relaxing days at the seaside . <p> The only way to experience all of these charming facets of the city is by imbibing it from as many perspectives as possible . Climb the citys seven steep hills for sweeping views of the city and beyond to see where the mighty Tagus river estuary to the south empties into the Atlantic Ocean to the west . Or , just get out and ride whether that be in a car , on a bike or a more adventurous form of three-wheeled transport . <h> Rent a car Lisbon on four wheels <p> Cruising around downtown can help visitors to get their bearings , but well save city center exploration for a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explore the surrounding areas outside of Lisbon , starting in Sintra , an enchanting little city and UNESCO World Heritage Site 25km outside Lisbon . <p> Luckily we pulled into town just before 10am , early enough to find parking and have the towns 9th century Moorish castle almost entirely to ourselves . Day-trippers flock to Sintra and its fabulously ornate 19th century Pena Palace , so beat the crowds here and then leave Sintra and loop over to Praia Grande , big beach , a popular surfing beach and Praia Adraga , a much smaller version of the big beach on your way to Cabo da Roca , the westernmost point in Europe . During our visit , it was chilly and wet , so when we discovered the six kilometer hike from Adraga Beach to the Cabo da Roca , we had to turn it down and drive instead . <p> After imagining life for Portuguese sailors using the lighthouse as a guide centuries ago , we left Cabo da Roca , and , as we rounded the curve to the coast of Cascais , the rain stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suddenly rolled in . Cascais is a not-so-small beach town that retains heaps of charm , and a spot we decided to actually stay in next time we come to Lisbon . The calm waters of the Atlantic are perfect for swimming , restaurants are varied offering anything from Indian to British to Portuguese fare . People here ( and there are many , many people here during the summer ) are all about relaxing on the beach , so even though we were far from the deserted beaches in Costa Rica we loved so much , and just a few feet from the nearest beachgoers , we just immersed ourselves in a book and enjoyed the sun . <p> The late afternoon cruise back to Lisbon along the Avenida Marginal de Cascais made us really realize what a fabulous destination Lisbon really is . The 20km drive along this beach promenade is dotted with beach town after beach town , each with its own patch of wide sandy beach , restaurants , bars and hotels . Everything here is geared toward one thing : the beach . fThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks , aquariums , or museums that act as tourist traps on this road . The town of Cascais itself has a surprisingly rich cultural calendar , but along the promenade all the way to Lisbon , the beach remains the main attraction . <p> A second day trip option with a rental car in Lisbon is to head south to the Costa de Caparica , over and past two world famous monuments you never knew existed in Lisbon . Cross the Ponte de 25 Abril bridge , which is the spitting image of the more famous Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco , and at the end you 'll pass directly under the shadow of the Cristo-Rei ( Jesus Christ ) statue , which bears more than a slight resemblance to the famous Cristo Redentor statue in Rio De Janeiro. - From there , it is just another 15 minutes across the peninsula before there are over 40 miles of non-stop beaches to choose from to spend a relaxing day at the beach . Stop off to eat at any of the beach side cabanas or pack a picnic for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to gain unique access to Lisbons smaller streets comes on three wheels with GoCar Tours , which we found ourselves doing one sunny Wednesday morning . <p> We turned into a narrow side street near the imposing Lisbon City Gate to find yellow go-carts all lined up in a row . The staff inside could not have been more friendly or helpful , giving us tips on what to see in Lisbon as well as in the surrounding areas . After a quick how-to session , we were given helmets and headed off to explore the Lisbon city streets . We set off and- were immediately welcomed by the English-speaking GPS guide , who not only gives driving instructions , but also explains the history of several attractions and locations throughout the tour . <p> We zipped around town for just under an hour in these speedy yellow three-wheeled machines , but some people rent GoCars in Lisbon for the entire day and even drive it down to Cascais . <p> One of the things we loved about the GoCars is the access to the side streets unavailable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider than two horses , and these narrow streets offer up some of the best glimpses into true Portuguese neighborhoods . <p> It was great to be able to shoot up and down these hills and hear about the history of these local gems , albeit catching some stares from the bewildered residents peeking down from their windowsills above . As we drove , we always made sure to give fellow GoCars a friendly wave , as well as the dozens of tourists who turned their cameras on us as we tooled by " when you rent a GoCar , you become a tourist attraction yourself ! <p> There are a few things to keep in mind if considering a GoCar rental . First of all , you should be looking for a bit of adventure . Weaving in and out of traffic among cars , trucks streetcars , bicycles , buses and pedestrians is an adrenaline rush , especially if you , like us , are not accustomed to go-carting . Also , it is a bumpy ride at times . Lisbon is covered in cobble stones , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of any tour through the inner city . If this is a concern , scoot straight over to the Belem area . Not only are many of the famous tourist attractions located here , but this is a flat area right on the shore with paved roads and pathways . If it sounds like fun , but you 're not looking for too much adventure , Lisbon GoCar Tours do make a small set of golf cart-like vehicles available , which are easier to drive and might be more familiar to some users . <h> Rent a bicycle Lisbon on two wheels <p> For a liberating day out with sun , sand and shoreline , the best thing to do is rent a bike in Lisbon . We started off from Bike Iberia , right downtown a block from the train station and pedaled the seven kilometers along the bank of the Tagus River . <p> The clearly marked cycle path is popular both with Lisbons fit , athletic types out running and cycling and the citys fisherman , who set up their fishing rods early each morning . Along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clusters of slightly upscale waterside restaurants serving up primarily Italian , Portuguese and Spanish cuisine . Once in Belem , we locked up the bikes and headed to sample Pasteis de Nata , Portugals most famous pastry , at the renowned Pasteis de Belem , where only three chefs know the recipe for what are considered the best Pasteis de Nata in the world . After filling up on these creamy , sugary delights , we spent the afternoon at the popular tourist sites here like the Belem Tower , Jeronimo Monastery and the Museu Berardo Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art before our ride back to the heart of Lisbon . <p> Another option is to take the bike right into the train station and hop on one of the coastal trains out to Cascais where the cycleways are perfect for peaceful riding along the shoreline or take the ferry across the Tagus to the Alameida and ride 20 minutes to the wide , sandy beaches of the Costa da Caparica . <p> Cycling this expansive area of the coast in its entirety is too much for one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return the bike to Bike Iberia , so just cycle along , stopping off at whatever stretch of beach strikes your fancy for a few hours and then head on to the next . <p> While we loved the freedom we felt with our bikes in Lisbon , those seven steep hills in the center are too much for us mere mortals to attack on two wheels . This means that city center exploration up and down the character-building hills must be done on your own two feet , or you can hop on to one of the many streetcars in town which again evoke pleasant memories of San Francisco . <h> Lisbon on one wheel <p> Exploring Lisbon on a unicycle ? Honestly , we have n't done thatyet ? Maybe we will save this on for next time ! <p> Either way , the more time you take to explore Lisbon , the more the city unfolds to reveal the depths of its charming character . Each city side street hides little secrets " a beautifully-tiled building , a centuries-old basement gin joint , tiny art galleries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times of day , and with the sun and the sand so nearby , we found ourselves as cheerful as ever ! Taking the time to explore the city on four , three and two wheels is what made us fall head over heels for Lisbon . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 16 Comments <p> Wow , I really want to go to Lisbon after seeing these pics ! Mainly because I want to drive round in one of those cute little yellow cars haha . Looks like the weather was in your favour too . Awesome photos , as always . <p> Thanks Julia ! Weve wanted to try a Gocar tour since we had seen them speeding around San Francisco last year . Its so much fun &amp; everyone turns their head when the speaking car approaches = Lisbon is definitely worth a visit , we had a fabulous time there &amp; still miss it ! <p> Gocar touring looks like its a lot of fun ! My parents visited Lisbon a few years ago , and ever since then , I 've wanted to visit as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday ! <p> Mark , Lisbon is probably our favorite city in all of Europe ! Its very diverse , has a ton of things to offer so that you will never get bored and if you go , you have to take a gocar tour they really are a lot of fun = <p> Not many people rent a car when in Lisbon , as the beaches of Cascais and the palaces of Sintra can easily be reached on a short train ride . But you apparently tried all sorts of transportation ! Next time try the river cruise . Perhaps because yours was quite a long stay , you were able to capture the city quite well . You 're right that the best part of the city is going around ( walking or in all sort of vehicles ! ) finding the surprising charms along the way , from the views to the tiles and cobblestone designs ! Next time also visit Porto , the countrys second city . It also has wonderful views and great wine = <p> You are right , it is actually very easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit Sintra , Estoril , Cascais and the other beaches . We only got a car for one day to fit in as many places outside of Lisbon as possible , and it was worth it , but we couldve done everything by bus and train if wed had more time . And yes , the ferry or a river cruise is an excellent way to see the city from a completely different perspective ! We cant wait to go back to Portugal and Porto is high on our list . <p> Thanks James ! San Francisco was the first place where we saw them , but only at Golden Gate Park we had no idea that you can actually take them out on the streets and drive them just like cars ! Hope you 'll get the chance to try them out one day = <p> On Megs recommendation ( from Dopes on the Road ) , I am devouring ALL of your Lisbon/Portugal posts , and maybe a few on SF as well ( I 'm a native ) . They 're so fantastic ! <p> My wife and I are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in Sagres and your posts have me fearing I 'll never want to leave/will eschew my hometown forever for its Euro twin ! <p> And its absurdly sentimental , but I might actually stop and hug the Ponte de 25 Abril bridge since the Bay Bridge is now dead ( RIP , *wails* ) and the one in Lisbon is a true hybrid of both spans back home . <p> I just spent way too much time on your site your photography is beautiful and I love your style .. subscribed right away = Have to thank Meg for including you in her queer blog list ! ! As for Lisbon you will love it ! And shopping is super cheap there , by the way = I 'd love to hear how you feel about the SF / Lisbon comparison when you 're back because you know SF so much better than I do . Lisbon does of course have a very European feel to it that SF cant offer I think you 'll love it ! ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Thanks to its lush green vegetation , Kuaui is also known as the garden isle ' . <p> Many people have seen the jaw-droppingly beautiful scenery of Kauai in movies like Jurassic Park or King Kong , but it has been famous for much longer , mainly through Elvis Presley 's film Paradise , Hawaiian Style . <p> Visitors do not only love Kauai for its natural beauty , but also because it is much less populated than the Big Island , Maui and Oahu , and it has much more laid-back feel to it . Tourist development started much later than the other islands , which meant that building heights were strictly restricted no building can be higher than a coconut tree .

The colors of the canyon are very similar to the colors of the Grand Canyon , but the wetter climate in- Kauai added a bright green to it which makes it even more colorful. - Several lookouts along the canyon , all well worth a stop for their different angles and sights. - The best time to visit is in the late morning , after the clouds and morning fog have disappeared . <p> Follow the road beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are 45 hiking paths , some of which lead into Waimea Canyon .

@@107142932 @2542932/ <h> Street food junkies on the hunt in Guatemala <p> The Globetrottergirls are street food junkies , and we were not afraid to shout it from the proverbial rooftops during our 11 week stay in Mexico last summer . Embracing the local cuisine , in its most local forms , deepens the traveler 's relationship with the country and its culture , and it is fun to sample foods from food stands which essentially form an unofficial outdoor buffet in central parks throughout Latin America . Plus , for those of us nomads out there traveling year round , street food is the perfect break from the lengthy and expensive process of eating out in restaurants day in and day out . <p> So great is our love of vegetarian street food that we were bursting at the seams to sample Guatemalan street food , and were especially excited when we arrived in Antigua and discovered street food vendors galore lined up in front of La Merced church . This excitement was quickly put in check , however , as street food in Guatemala is very meaty . Lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vegetarian options . Find a round-up of our street food favorites below : <h> Pupusas <p> This El Salvadorian staple is very popular in Guatemala . The thick corn tortillas are stuffed with either refried beans , cheese , a bean-cheese combo , or cooked pork . A marinated cabbage and tomato salsa are added on top . Despite their popularity in Guatemala , this street food does n't begin to compare to the delicious originals made in El Salvador , where the cheese is tastier and the shape and quality are far better than most in Guatemala . But if you 're veggie and in a hurry , a pupusa will fill you up easily . Price : Q12/US $1.50 . <h> Elote <p> Another typical dish is elote , or corn on the cob . In Guatemala , elote it is not served with mayonnaise and chili powder as in Mexico , but rather salsa , salt and sometimes lime . Corn is the basis for the Guatemalan diet , and this cheap and not entirely unhealthy snack can be eaten any and everywhere . Price : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico and Mexican cuisine means something different to what the word means in Guatemala , where a taco ' is similar to the Mexican Flauta ' . One major difference is that in Mexico , corn tortillas are stuffed , rolled and then deep fried . In Guatemala , the rolled corn tortillas are first deep fried , and then stuffed with either potatoes or meat . This makes a difference as they are usually stuffed with more inside than in Mexico . As almost everything in Guatemala , tacos are topped with cabbage and cheese . No matter how they serve em , or what they call them , tacos or flautas are one of our favorite street food items . For the best we found in Guatemala , head to Lake Atitlan 's village of San Pedro la Laguna , where , just up the road from the Pana dock , a little street vendor sells the best tacos in the country. * - Price : Q8/US$1 <p> *the exclusive opinion of Globetrottergirls and though not official , trust us in judging their awesomeness . <h> Tostadas <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crunchy , fried corn tortilla topped with refried beans ( though in Guatemala , these are black beans , not pinto beans ) and/or delicious guacamole plus lots of lettuce , tomoatoes , onions , white cheese powder ' , plus beets , cabbage , and , sometimes , a slice of a hard-boiled egg on top .

They are certainly not my food of choice , but they do the trick , plus they are everywhere . Price : Q10/$1.25 <h> Bu+uelos and other sweet street food <p> Guatemala is big on sweets . There are the multi-colored popcorn balls , biscuit rings , something similar to peanut brittle , and loads and loads of donuts , but Dani 's absolute favorite are the Bu+uelos . We 've come across this word a few times to describe very different dishes . In Guatemala , fried dough balls , usually three , are served up with lots of warm , if not overly watery , syrup . Apparently they are a typical Christmas dish , but we found them already in early October . Price : Q10/US $1.25 for three <p> For the meat-lovers out there , the street food options in Guatemala triple . The meaty varieties include salchichas ( sausages ) , chicharrones ( fried pork skin ) , cheveres hot dogs ( apparently there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , cheap fried chicken , burgers and fries rule the streets of Guatemala . Sandwiches are another popular item , with baguette-like white bread stuffed with lettuce , mayo , onion and usually fried , breaded pork . <p> It has been especially recommended to us that you sample the garnachas , small fried corn tortillas which are stuffed with shredded meat and cheese and usually topped with cabbage , and the chile rellenos . The smaller sweet red peppers ( similar to bell peppers , but smaller ) are stuffed with beef , dipped in egg and deep fried , squeezed flat and then put on French white bread , to which cabbage , beets , carrots and a special sauce are added . Of all the meaty street food , we most wanted to try these chile rellenos , but there is never a cheese variety , always meat only . <p> Note : We did find eating street food in Guatemala a bit riskier than in other countries in terms of belly aches and less ladylike bowel issues . It is especially important in Guatemala to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular food stands . If 20 locals are surrounding the street food vendor , jump in line there too . Locals want clean , healthy food as much as visitors do . Do not feel deterred by this warning , but do make sure you choose your street food wisely . <h> 19 Comments <p> Nice round-up . You know I did n't  have a single post about food in Guatemala . I do n't  know if it was because I had just come from Mexico but I found food to be really underwhelming and could n't find anything that was n't a play off another countries food ( i.e. pupusas ) . <p> Hi Ayngelina , we should have added an important fact on the end of this article : Nothing beats Mexican Street Food . You 're totally right . Its always exciting for veggies to be able to belly up to a street food stand with the meat eaters , and so we were happy to find options in Guatemala . But it does not compare to Mexico . Viva Mexican Street Food ! ! ! <p> Hi Jill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the KFOG Kaboom festival in San Fran way back in May 2010 , but no rellenitos . I am so so sure though that if you hit the Mission District in San Fran you 'll find many of the street food items on our Guatemala and Mexico list . We could eat in the Mission District for weeks on end , you 're so lucky to be based in the Bay Area ! ! ! <p> Awesome post ! This is just what we need for when we get to Guatemala . It makes me very happy to hear there are so many street food options . In South America the street food is not great for vegetarians- corn with cheese and fruit are the main options . <p> We did try bu+uelos in Colombia last week but I think they are different here . Dough balls with curd cheese inside . They had a weird taste and we werent fans . <p> Hi guys ! Hm , interested to try these different bu+uelos in Colombiawere glad that you like the post , and the street food in Guatemala is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best , and Mexico is a dream for veggie street food . Of course you can use our post on that as a reference = Also , in El Salvador the pupusas really are great , though always beans , cheese or beans and cheese . Now were hungry . = <p> Oh you will love the Mexican street food much better than the Guatemalan street food , and much more veggie friendly ! There is so much to try ! We are still thinking about it and miss it El Salvadorian pupusas are another favorite of ours look out for a post on them this week = <p> I enjoy eating street food in any places . Why ? Since its more cheaper than eating in restaurant of course ! Then , there are so many choices . You can eat different kinds of foods within a budget . Something that food trippers can really enjoy ! <p> Agreed Dani.I am in Meixco now and have spent the last month trying so many different amazing foods . I am heading to Guatemala Friday and expect after being here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  think any food will ever top Mexican food.although Vietnamese is close ! <p> you have to remember that the region from southern mexico all the way to costa rica was once called Mesoamerica . Of course the food is going to be similar but it is still not the same . no one is copying from anyone , like ayngelina said . The problem is not mexican cuisine is more widely known to americans . Each region seasons things differently and I do n't  suggest eating street food . Guatemala has better food in real eateries. and you would be surprises of the wide variety of vegetarian options in Guatemalan cuisine . Perhaps you should give Guatemala another visit and do some research in our one of kind Mayan/Guatemalan/Spanish food . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142933 @2542933/ <h> Polaroid Of The Week : Soaking Up Cuban Life In Trinidad <p> The true showstopper in Cuba for me wasnt Havana , but Trinidad , a city founded by the Spanish that dates back to 1514 and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site . <p> I was n't sure if itd be worth the long drive to get there the city is located pretty much in the middle of the island , halfway between Havana in the north and Santiago in the far south ; around 6 hours on a bus from Havana . But I am so glad that we decided to add it to our itinerary , despite the distance from Havana and Vi+ales , our first two stops . <p> Trinidad looked like it had n't  changed much since the Spanish founded it in the 16th century colonial houses line cobblestone streets , there are several Spanish-colonial churches and neatly arranged plazas , and horse carts outnumber cars . When people say that a trip to Havana feels like a trip back to the 1950s ( because of all the American vintage cars from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Trinidad feels like a trip back to the 16th century . <p> In Trinidad , we got to really soak up Cuban life . With four nights here , we had plenty of time to experience Cuban culture , watch people dance salsa in the town square and in the bars every night , watch locals meet for a chat or a glass of rum in one of the benches that lined all the plazas , and artists draw paintings in the many galleries . <p> Every time we wandered around town we found a new street that was oozing with character , another crumbling church , another shop that looked more like a museum than a store , with items written on a chalk board and old-fashioned scales on the counter . The rolling hills surrounding the town and the nearby ocean ( the popular beach Playa Ancon is only eight miles from Trinidad ) only add to the attraction of this picturesque little town . Trust me : Trinidad is not to be missed on a trip to Cuba ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142934 @2542934/ <h> Planning a Trip to Iceland on a Budget : Things to Know Before you go <p> One of the things I say on my About Page is that - I make mistakes so you do n't  have to and I actually made a big mistake in Iceland . Well , it was n't actually a mistake , because I knew I had to hit up one of the big grocery stores before leaving Reykjavik because big supermarkets are sparse on the island , and we wanted to pick up food to make picnic lunches during our road trip restaurants in Iceland are pricey . <p> And that 's what we did , we went to the first Bonus supermarket we came across , ready to load up the car with groceries . Only that the supermarket did n't  open until 11am ( ! ) , and we were there at 9am . So we decided to head off on the first leg of our road trip , assuming wed be coming back through Reykjavik after driving the Golden Circle . But we did n't  . We headed straight south . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vik , with a very limited selection.I put together some other things Ive learned on my road trip through Iceland to help save you money during your trip , to give you an idea what to expect in regards to- how much things cost , and last but not least some thoughts on renting a car for your trip vs. using public transportation or hitchhiking . <h> Budget Tips for Iceland <p> Do n't pay for water <p> I was surprised when I read on other blogs that travelers had paid for water in Iceland . Icelanders pride themselves for having some of the best water in the world ! It comes straight from a spring and is delicious " why would you pay for bottled water ? ! Plus , you wo n't contribute to plastic bottle garbage . <p> Shop at grocery stores and make picnic lunches <p> If you 're on a budget , you wont be able to afford much more than the famous Icelandic hot dogs , which are available on hot dog stands in most places for ISK350 380 ( US$2.70-$3 ) . - Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prices on the menus . Restaurants in Iceland sure arent- cheap ! A pizza would usually start at- around ISK2,000 ( US$15.50 ) a burger around ISK1,900 ( US$15 ) , a vegetarian pasta dish around ISK2,200 ( US$17 ) * . <p> *The exchange rate used is from February 2016 . <p> Our daily picnic lunch : Icelandic skyr , a thick Icelandic yogurt <p> To give you an idea what other things in Iceland cost : <p> Coffee is between ISK350 and 500 /US$2.70 3.80 ( a little more for cappuccinos , lattes , etc ) . <p> Beer starts at ISK800 ( up to 1200 ) /US$6.20-9.20 , but if you buy a can in the supermarket , it will cost around- ISK350 /US$2.70 ( for 500ml ) . Tip : If you 're renting a car at the airport , - you might want to consider picking up beer in the Duty Free Shop . A six-pack of 500ml Viking beers is around ISK1,500 /US$11.55 . <p> Gas was ISK204/US$1.57 per litre when I visited in September 2015 . That 's nearly US$6 per gallon ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cabs from the airport are around ISK12,000/US$92 . <p> To get an idea what other groceries and entertainment in Iceland cost , check out this article on the cost of living in Iceland . <p> Note that there- is a big difference between high season and low season prices for rental cars and accommodation ! <h> Where to shop <p> Kronan , Bonus and Netto are the cheapest supermarket chains in Iceland . <h> Tipping <p> Tipping is not customary in Iceland , so save your change ! <h> Cash vs. credit cards <p> I have to admit that I did n't take out cash at all while I was in Iceland " I paid with my card everywhere ! And not once was I unable to buy something because I did n't have cash , cards were accepted in all the stores and restaurants I went to , even a small coffee shop in a tiny village along the way . <h> SIM card <p> A SIM card with some data is useful if you want to look up directions or call a hotel/hostel or use a road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast- website . The Duty Free Shop at the airport sells Siminn SIM cards , which have the best coverage in Iceland , - with 1GB data , 100 minutes and 100 text messages for ISK2,990 ( around US$23 ) . - A Vodafone SIM card can be bought at the same shop for half the price , ISK1,500 ( US$11.85 ) , containing 300MB data and ISK1,000 credit. - If you do n't need any of these things , you 'll be totally fine with wi-fi , available in 95% of all guesthouses , I 'd say , and also in most cafes , restaurants and gas stations . <h> Other Things to Consider <p> When to go <p> I would recommend visiting in the shoulder season " May or September . That way you can avoid the crowds that have flooded- Iceland during the summer months in recent years since it has become such a popular destination , but you can still enjoy the activities that shut down in the winter months , like glacier boat tours , paragliding , snorkeling/diving in Silfra , or whale watching tours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have considerably less hours of daylight than in the summer , which makes a big difference when mapping out a driving route . <h> Weather <p> I thought I knew crazy weather from living in Britain but Icelandic weather easily tops that . We often woke up to rain and cloudy skies , and a couple of hours later the sun was shining . Or I would start driving in the morning with blue skies and then drove straight into rain . If you wake up to rain , do n't be fooled and think you should stay in " I guarantee you that the weather changes several times during the day . Vedur.is is the best weather resource for Iceland . <p> You cant really tell in the photo , but it was pouring down when we stopped at the glacier <h> Road trip vs . Public transportation vs . Hitchhiking <p> Self-guided vs. guided <p> As soon as we hit the road and saw tour buses by the dozen , I knew we had made the right decision going with an Iceland self-guided tour " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we needed , and yet it was comforting to know that we did n't need to take care of our- accommodation . The places we slept at were all vouched for and in a strategic location for each day 's route , but I could decide how to plan the route , how much time to spend in each place , if we wanted to stop in other places along the way , or if we wanted to skip some of the suggestions in the itinerary . After all , I did n't need to follow each day 's schedule to a tee . <p> A spontaneous stop at the volcano craters of Grabrokargigar only possible because we were on a self-guided drive ! <p> And I was more than happy to have the flexibility to spend as much time as I wanted in places like the magnificent Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon , instead of being herded back on the bus like most other tourists there . Or to decide to turn off and follow an unpaved road , only to find another glacier lagoon , Fjallsarlon , also stunning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken had we been on an organized group tour . <p> Iceland by rental car <p> If you do n't  mind mapping out your road trip route yourself and booking your accommodation , there are plenty of car rentals available at the international airport . I never felt uncomfortable driving in Iceland , but you might find the narrow mountain and coastal roads a little intimidating if you 're only used to driving multi-lane highways in the U.S. However , I would n't trade in driving myself for anything else it just gives you so much freedom . I shared some driving tips for Iceland here . If you do n't  need the comfort of a hotel bed , you can also rent a camper van , by the way . My friend Matt explored Iceland in a Happy Camper and seemed to have enjoyed it . <p> You 'll want to be able to stop at Icelands gazillion waterfalls ! <p> Iceland by public transportation <p> Iceland does n't  have a rail network , but there are buses that connect the major towns . However , the bus schedule is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city to city instead of stopping at all the waterfalls , geysers and glaciers you want to see on a trip to Iceland .

For bus schedules during the summer months ( including prices ) , check out Iceland On Your Own , who also offer a passport that offers discounted travel in several regions of Iceland . Their detailed bus schedules can be found here. - Instead of traveling Iceland by public bus , consider hitchhiking:Hitchhiking in Iceland <p> Hitchhiking in Iceland is adventurous , but its much more common than in the U.S. , for example , and we came across quite a few hitchhikers and even picked some up along the way . For us it was a fun way to meet other travelers and hear their crazy stories ( a couple we picked up was nearly blown over a cliff in their little tent on a stormy night ) . Its definitely doable to circle Iceland on the Ring Road by hitching , but be aware that in some remote parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ( hours ! ) and as I said before , the weather changes rapidly , so you might be standing in the rain for a while in a country that is chilly year-round .

If you are the one with the car , you can post the ride you 're planning to take on a ride sharing website , including how many seats are available and how much you charge per person . Its a great way to get some money for gas . <p> People in need of a ride can post the details of the ride they want to take on this website , and car owners who are heading that way can respond to your post .

I do n't  think we will have time to hire a car and do our own thing that you clearly recommend , I expect visiting via a cruise ship there will be a huge amount of bus tours sheeping people around . Not sure what we will do , the sheep method does n't  excite us . Possibly find a smaller tour group more bespoke = <p> Thank you , John = I was on a cruise once and there were car rentals available right on the pier when we exited the ship . Maybe thatll be the case on your cruise too ? I highly recommend renting a car and seeing the island by yourself at least a little bit of it . That way you 'll have the freedom to stop wherever you want instead of being sheeped around = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Canada is celebrating 150 years of its confederation this year and celebrates it with a spectacular gift to its visitors : FREE admission to all of its National Parks , marine-conservation sites and historic monuments . That 's right , you can visit as many National Parks as you 'd like and not pay a dime for it ! But deciding which of the 44 National Parks to visit can be daunting , because this being Canada , of course all of them are breathtakingly beautiful and worth a visit . <p> To help you decide where to go , we picked the six best National Parks to visit in Canada for you : <h> 1 Banff National Park , Alberta <p> Banff National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( established in 1885 ) , but also Canada 's most popular one .

The drive that spans the two parks , Icefield Parkway , is often named as the most scenic drive in all of North America , making the journey worth it already . Other reasons to visit Jasper National Park ? Turquoise glacier lakes , wildlife ( including elk , caribou , bears and bighorn sheep ) , backcountry and mountain trails , glaciers forests and alpine meadows . Maligne Lake is the show stopper among the lakes in Jasper , with three glaciers visible from the lake " make sure to bring a kayak and get on the lake ! <p> Not to be missed : The scenic Lake Maligne drive which starts in Jasper and ends at the lake . If you are a star gazing , go in October , when the Dark Sky Festival takes place in Jasper . The park is recognized as a Dark Sky Preserve by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light pollution in October makes it the perfect time to come and star gaze . That said : the stars you see here are amazing year round , so make sure to check out the night sky . <p> Best hike : The Skyline Trail , a 42-kilometer backcountry trail that starts at Maligne Lake and takes 2 to 3 days to hike . <h> 3 Prince Edward Island National Park , P.E.I. <p> Prince Edward Island National Park , named after the island it is located on , sits on the far eastern end of Canada , stretching along the Atlantic Coast . P.E.I. is located east of New Brunswick and north of Nova Scotia , in the Gul of Saint Lawrence . The National Park consists of forests , salt marshes , coastline , sand dunes and the red sandstone cliffs the park is famous for .

And there 's more than polar bears : Wapusk is also home to arctic foxes , wolves and caribou ( wild reindeer ) . The subarctic National Park is very remote and it is quite an undertaking to get there , but that makes it only more special . The closest town is Churchill , which can only be accessed by plane , or by the twice-a-week train from Winnipeg ( takes two nights or sometimes longer , depending on weather conditions ) . The park itself is made up of tundra , subarctic forest and muske and borders Hudson Bay ( sometimes referred to as Arctic Ocean ) . Cape Churchill is known to be the best location in the world to view and photograph wild- polar bears , which is why the park is popular with wildlife photographers . Since there are no roads you have to join a guided tour " check out the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be missed : Try to time your visit so that you get to see fluffy little polar bear cubs ! The best time to see them is in February / March . If you come to Wapusk in late October / early November , you wo n't see cubs , but about 1,000 polars gather around Hudson Bay , awaiting the freeze-up of the sea . <p> Best hike : Unescorted visitors are not permitted in the park , so no epic hikes here . During polar bear high season ' , guides who lead tours in the park carry firearms in case a polar bear attacks . During the summer months , you can access the park via helicopter for guided tundra hikes . <p> Yoho National Park in British Colombia is another one of Canada 's picture-perfect Rocky Mountains parks , with rugged mountains , soaring waterfalls , magnificent glaciers , sheer cliffs , scenic lakes , turquoise rivers and lush green forests .

@@107142940 @2542940/ <h> Heres why we think Chilean food sucks . <p> Sorry , Chile , but its true . For as much as we loved our time traveling thousands of miles up and down your country , our palates were left entirely under-stimulated . <p> First , let it be known that there is nothing spicy to eat in Chile . Do not let the name fool you . There is a deceiving red powder , called aj+ , on the table with salt and pepper , but even if you cover your pizza in a blanket of it , thered be about as much kick as from a legless man . <p> I mention pizza , and if you read this website often , you will know we are always on the hunt for excellent pizza . Unfortunately the Chilean version pales desperately in comparison to its Argentine neighbor . It is dry , basic , unimaginative and does nothing more than to satisfy large groups , teenage boys and two vegetarian GlobetrotterGirls when nothing else is even remotely interesting on the menu . <p> Ugh , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well either . In Argentina the thick , buttery dough filled with creamy mozzarella , tangy blue cheese or meat ( if that 's your thing ) became an addiction . Here , the shape and concept is the same , but the dough is like cardboard , the cheese like rubber . <p> Chile is by far the most sophisticated country in South America , yet its food reflects none of this sophistication . Take the famous Chorillana a Chilean national dish that we would simply call Stoner Food . Meat , large chunks of lazily chopped broiled vegetables , ham , cheese and a fried egg or two are thrown on top of a huge bed of French fries . That 's it . Just pull the fries out , dip them in some off the yolk and/or ketchup and/or mayo , and eat the rest with a mix of your hands and a fork . <p> Next up , the completo is a hot dog . Its not very complete either . Its got a few things on it , but its just a hot dog with none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style dog let alone bratwurst . <p> Once , we ordered a sandwich that , on a neighboring table , looked remarkably similar to a Mexican Torta . But rather than being fresh , thick , warm bread piled high with so many delicious ingredients it puts Subway to shame , this was just cold , boiled green beans , queso fresco ( the worst white cheese in.the.world ) , lettuce , tomato and onion . Green beans on a sandwich ? Really ? <p> You 'll notice that much of these are some sort of sandwich or bread dish , and not one would be classified as healthy . Even salads are not done right . How often did we get a plate with four ingredients lined up in a row a strip of lettuce next to a row of sliced tomatoes next to sliced cucumbers next to , say , shaved carrots . The ingredients were not even mixed together , vegetable oil and white vinegar on top , for the price of that Chorillana those stoners , sorry locals , are chewing down on at the next table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fried dough bought from a street vendor and then slathered in mayo . That 's right , just fried dough in mayonnaise ( we did n't  say it was n't good , but again with the stoner food ! ) . <p> Continuing on the subject of sugar , ordering a smoothie and forgetting to ask for no sugar meant resigning ourselves to the presence of a new cavity by days end . <p> And salt ? I once watched a mother salt her pre-teen daughters dinner so heavily , had she also lit and handed her a cigarette it would n't have surprised me . <p> There are some healthier dishes , like the curanto , a meat dish cooked underground in a pot over hot rocks , similar to a hangi in New Zealand . Fish , meat , bread and potatoes are heated wrapped in large leaves for hours and then taken out to be eaten together . But this is 1 . only in the south of the country and 2. too time-consuming dish to order with any regularity . <p> You 'll note that most dishes are for meat-eaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican tamales , with corn meal masa , with only sprinkles of corn inside and no other flavor to speak of . There is always the Paila option , which is just scrambled eggs , often with avocado . Oddly , this is not considered a breakfast dish , but an once , meaningafternoon snack ) . <p> And now we come to the Mote con Huesillo , a popular summer drink that , while not bad , is just plain weird . <p> Served in a plastic cup , first the vendors add two or three big scoops of cooked husked wheat . Yup , wheat . That 's the mote part . Then , one or two stewed peaches in a syrupy liquid are poured on top . This is not blended together . You chew the drink using a straw and a spoon to consume it . <p> What was so disappointing about the basic , unimaginative and unflavorful foods is that unlike most places in Latin America , in Chile you can drink the water . So in theory you could eat street food freely and happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison feels absurd , considering the delicious , spicy Pad Thai for a dollar versus fried dough and a cup of wheat and peach juice . <p> This brings me to our biggest frustration of all the lack of international food . In Cambodia we had fairly authentic Mexican food , in Malaysia we had spot on British tea and scones . In Chile , any attempt at international cuisine is like eating a bowl of plastic fruits . It always looks so realistic , but once you bite down , there is no flavor at all . Look , the Brits , the Americans , the Germans , we all have boring traditional foods that 's why we steal international cuisine and mix them all together and call it fusion . All Chile has to do is look north to Peru for fine examples of Japanese-Peruvian and Nouveau-Andean cuisines . <p> The only international food that Chile really seems to have gotten right was the Kuchen . That 's right , German cake . The Germans arrived to the Lake District en masse in the 19th century and their delicious cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dessert leaves much to be desired , with- manjar-filled flaky pastries , alfajores and leche asada , which- pretty much tastes like flan made of boogers . <p> Look , Chileans do wine very well , and pisco sours , too ( though Peruvians would say they stole it from them ) . They grow delicious avocados and we ate at least one a day every day for over three months . <p> And of course there are some excellent chefs making magic throughout the country . We ate extremely well in San Pedro de Atacama , loved the pizza at Tiramisu in Santiago along with Le Fournil , the chain Cassis made great food and one of our top meals was a seriously delicious three course meal at La Marmita in Punta Arenas , as far south as you can get on the Chilean mainland . <p> Chile , your glaciers and geysers , penguins and sea lions , volcanoes , lakes and massive mountains mesmerized us . Just glance through these posts , and you 'll see how much we love you . We felt right at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vowing to spend a month here or there , or even to plan a GlobetrotterGirls Getaway here someday . And you can be sure that our feelings are genuine , since we stayed over 100 days with you in spite of , most definitely not because of , your food . 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 858 Comments <h> Comment navigation <p> You girls are absolutely disgraceful , uncultured , rude , and downright ignorant . None of the food mentioned is food that the country is known for . Where did you eat ? tourist places ? cheap street restaurants ? What kind of comment is the one you made about the mote con huesillo ? " weird " just because YOU believe a dish is weird does not mean its a bad dish . You even mentioned it . You call yourselves " globetrotters " and go around eating out at the least adventurous or well researched food places in countries . Shame on you and shame on your whole brand . You went to a country and ate nothing but junk of course it was not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con riendas ? Las papas a la diabla ? Los completos ? los asados ? ya que mencionaron sandwiches , el ave palta ? y todo el resto de la comida rica que falto por probar . Ustedes dan ASCO . Sinceramente , una chica de padres chilenos y puertorriquenos . Nosotros si sabemos de comida . <p> Listen dumbass , I have lived here in Chile for several years . I have traveled to and eaten in many , many more . Chile is a culinary disappointment . Get over it . You are the uncultured , rude , and downright ignorant person here , which leads me to believe that you must be somewhat.Chilean . <p> Your opinion is certainly not an authority . You can say Chilean food " sucks " , but your assessment does not mean anything . Coming from someone who needs to express dislike by offending an entire country minimises your goal . THAT alone says a lot about your character , taste and cultural provenance . In my humble opinion to say " I do n't  like Chilean food " will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Call it semantics , but I doubt you would , I am afraid you do n't  know what that means . <p> You know NOTHING about Chilean food and your article was a fine example of why people think Europeans and Americans have sticks so far up your own asses you cant even see straight the amount of uppity know-it. **29;118;TOOLONG bullshit you girls spat out was un-fucking.believable . This is why people in latinamerican countries dislike tourists . Because you 're rude and ignorant , and talk with authority about shit you clearly know nothing about . There is excellent food over here . I 'm a cook and I 've been a culinary student for years . Our culture has so much mix that we incorporate spices from all over the world . I have no idea what you mean when you say there is no spice . Aj+ de color is a condiment that has literally no actual spice at all . Churrascos , chorrillanas and completos are junk kinda food and it is NOT TRADITIONAL at all . Its just cheap and available . There is TONS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punch than jalape+os and habaneros mixed together . There so many other options to go for instead of all that shit you choose and decided to label as " chilean food " , where did you even find those places ? I mean its not even THAT hard to find freakin awesome places to eat great food , so many people from abroad do so and leave with an awesome culinary experience besides all the natural wonders that this land offers , you just got ta be smart and willing enough to look beyond the tourist guides , talk to real locals and respect the place you 're using to cement your " globetrotter " persona so again , your ignorance is pretty crystal clear . This country has tons of awesome people doing awesome food on the streets , in small restaurants and businesses , but that 's for the eyes and palettes of people with no prior judgment , an open mind and a humble heart , none of which you seem to have . Do your research before steppin into a culture to then proceed and talk massive crap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude might take you to places where you find real things and maybe , just MAYBEVnot just use traveling as an excuse to sound worldly . <p> Face it , your food sucks compared to what you produce and export out of the ground . No imagination and what Chile considers a " great typical dish " , sucks . Get used to it . <p> I have lived here for 4 years and the food continues to suck . The variety of food sucks ( except seafood when there is no red-tide ) when the irresponsible greedy Salmon exporters break the rules . Empanadas suck , salads suck , deserts suck , and need someone with some talent let 's say from Peru to teach people how to cook . <p> Oh My god ! Tough pastel the choclo ? ? ? You do realize that in pastel the choclo the corn is actually blended then cooked right . You also realize that its made with ground beef right . Do you feel ridiculous yet ? I would . <p> Lia is most likely Chilean and has basically no culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination . Outside of 1700 Spain and the Mapuches basic diet , their really is not food culture here . Chile should stop hating everyone around them and learn how to cook . <p> Well dear Kalbertine , I am certainly Chilean , however , the pleasure of knowing the taste of foods from other countries is not one of my shortcomings . As I read your comment I cant help but to wonder why your your comments is so ignorant AND mistaken . It is pure assumption ( you know what they say about assuming things ) I am sure you do n't  care to know that I have tried foods from all over the world , and , not because I have been to every single country , but because while studying abroad I had the opportunity to try food made by my classmates from the 7 continents . We had a cultural group we created to do just that , try our different foods and learn from our cultures . Kalbertine , I do n't  need to tell you that you continue to be wrong but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenager does n't  give you a pass either . Given that fact I will not longer honor your comments with an answer . I have better things to do with my time . <p> you probably were born poor and do n't  have culture and are used to eating what low class chileans eat . you have to expand your palate and try new things . all the photos you posted clearly show how you did n't  go anywhere else . you 're literally the worst person in the world . <p> just to let you know Chile may derive its name from a Native American word meaning either " ends of the earth " or " sea gulls " ; from the Mapuche word chilli , which may mean " where the land ends ; " or from the Quechua chiri , " cold " , or tchili , meaning either " snow " or " the deepest point of the Earth " . Not because is spicy , so ignorant . <p> I m a peruvian gastronomy student , and I think you guys are pretty ignorant . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens , but Chilean food appeals to THEIR palates , not everything has to taste European . And I 'm 1000% sure native latin-americans do n't  give a damn about muh health food . If you want salads or excellent pizza just move to Italy or something . If you want to travel the world , you got ta keep an open mind and def NOT expect european fusion cuisine everywhere you go . <p> HaHaHa Oh wo Wait hahaha . That made me laugh . You think Chile the country is named that way cuz it has spicy foods , wow . They do have chile and peppers in Chile but they call it different from other Latin countries just like beans and avocados have a different name in Chile HaHaHa I do n't  even know why I kept reading . <p> I am a chelian born and raised . I tell you right now that you 2 insult our country . You have the privilege of going up and down the country . You probably did n't  even bother to talk to the natives.when you go to a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You talk to the locals and get to know them . They know how to cook . Knowing my chelian people , they will invite you and have a party with foods and then you 'll know the real food . The chelian do n't  eat at restaurants , because we do n't  need to . The hot dog thing is another i nsult . You do know that America has the worst hot dogs . Ketchup and hotdogs what is that ? Put onions on makes look like a piece of crappie . You 2 are probably the only people I have ever heard say that our food sucks . What about American food hammers , pizza , hotdogs , and fried chicken that 's in every restaurant I have ever been to . <p> Im impressed how 2 women treat so bad and even expresss roudly about other culture and attack for free . Nobody here is saying that chilean food is at the level of france or italy . They have thousends of years of historiy , so instead of showing that you both are travellers , show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . Your blog sucks and all what is written here . The respect is important and all I think is that you did n't  have the minimiun of education to undersant it . Too much travel affected your intelligence , that 's for sure . <p> This is so sad , where did you go ? Did you ate at street ? So here is your reality : you ate in some cheap place because you are poor and ignorant ( you think our country called like that because the food ) . Better stay in your country eating McDonals and wanting war and do not come never again , you only mess our streets . <p> I 'm American but have lived in many different places and visited family in many different European countries . I 've also lived in Chile , where my husband is from . One thing , among many about this post , that are as disappointing as your opinion of Chilean food is that you did n't  mention any desserts in detail . Did you even try brazo de reina , or torta de mil hojas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Argentine food too much . Why ? They 're two very different cultures . Another thing is the really good food there usually is n't sold . Its made by families to share amongst each other , with their familys recipes . While they do n't  have anything on Italians , they 're food does n't  suck . You just have to know their culture for more than the 10 days you were there . <p> Horrible writing and you must really not know how to order foods or as mentioned before are traveling on a budget . You are traveling along the coast and the seafood options are endless . Meats are tasty and vegetables are also very rich in flavor . This article has got to be one of the worst written articles I have ever read . Reconsider your blogging career or hobby . <p> I do n't  know where you two ate , but it looks like all your budget allowed you to do was to eat at highway cafeterias . Not only have I lived in 10 different countries around the world , but I have lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own restaurant in Santa Cruz , Colchagua , where not only some of the worlds finest wine comes from but also is home to a lot of very rich people- hence , nice restaurants . I had the pleasure of personally knowing other restaurant owners and frequently dined at their establishments . I have traveled through the Andes by car several times , I have been to a plethora of places in Chile , both way north and south , and have spent a lot of time in Vina del Mar , Santiago and Concepci+n . My point is that I know my way around food there . First of all Chileans have some of the most amazing produce . If you would have ever bothered stopping at one of the local fruit and vegetable shops you would know that- especially the produce in Concepci+n is the most beautiful Ive ever seen . Next , if you would have ditched the tourist places and actually tried real local home cooking maybe your opinion would have been different . Did you ever actually go to a supermarket and buy what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , porotos con riendas , brazo de reina , anything made with lucuma , chirimoya ice cream , etc. ? I do n't  understand why you went all the way to Chile if you wanted to eat Mexican food or pizza . But besides that fact , there are plenty of international restaurants . The quality is no better than in other countries- average sushi , average Mexican food , average Italian- unless of course you pay to go to a nicer restaurant- and that is the same in every country . And about the sopaipillas , which happen to be my favorite snack I have never heard of mayonnaise on sopaipillas- maybe that is something that has eluded my attention , but they are usually served with pebre ( butter and lime work well also ) , which together with the slightly sweet sopaipilla create the perfect flavor combination . If you are not grown up enough to appreciate the simplicity of such a little thing , you should n't have a food blog. -also , probably you have n't tried sopaipillas pasadas either Most importantly , what I just cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful country and all you can do is bitch about the food . Your ignorant word vomit just makes you sound like little kids that did n't  get the right Barbie for Christmas . <p> I have been to Chile on a major business trip ( with thousands of other people ) for 1 week followed by a week of private travel . Our daily breakfast and lunch were provided by a Chilean company . I hate to say that the food was rather unhealthy ( often salty , sweet , and/or including a disproportionate amount of meat ) . While Chileans may love the food , almost everyone that I talked to in the business event was n't happy about it . In my private trips I went up North and ate several other dishes including many from local restaurants where Chileans were eating . There was not one meal that I could completely eat just because they were unhealty . <p> The only other SA country I have been to was Brazil , and I 'd say everyday food there was a lot better and I did not notice any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chile now , pleased someone stuck their necks out and made an accurate assessment of the food situation here . Of course you have a lot of negative comments , Chileans are proud Latin American people . Of course Chleans love the food ! Why not ? But , yes to your article on all accounts . Unless its a big hunk of meat , good luck . Its hard not to compare food in different parts of the world . But I really want to teach some people how to make some bread ! ! ! ! ! <p> I live here and the food is terrible . Chilean food is very basic and primitive and un healthy and chileans are very uneducated . Most chilenas never traveled out of chile so they do n't  know anything else , that 's why they like the food . <p> You are , absolutely , right . The Chilean food is disgusting and sparse . They steal the Peruvian food and the Pisco because they have no identity . In Chile there are more than 300 Peruvian restaurants . Come to Peru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to agree with this article . As a proud chilean ( both parents are from there ) , who lived there for 7 years , I was never pleased with the food . Bland , boring , uninspiring , primitive , and lacking seasoning ( other than salt as mentioned above ) is how I would describe the food there . Also a clear lack of presentation and plating at restaurants . They do n't  have a good eye for what looks aesthetically pleasing to eat . <p> It is said by someone from the first world with all the luxuries , here in Chile the food has history , dishes with products easy to find for the poor people that were in the country and still exist . Latin American food may seem to be between countries because it was from the Spanish colony , and many indigenous cultures shared their recipes . Chile is a land different from the rest of Latin America , who wrote this hoped that here they will dance zamba and fly toucans in Santiago . Chile as it is different it needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your developed countries would go hungry for years , they would love our dishes like the charquic+n , the Porotos con Rienda and the Cazuela . Sure you prefer to eat at a vegan friendly Starbucks , but that 's not our reality . If you are going to travel to a country you must understand the history of this and not expect a country totally different from yours to have European food . <p> I am a Chilean Chef living in London and I can only say you are very ignorant , rude , impolite and super funny ! unfortunately you did not get our traditional food and just for that you are no able to give your belief . Did you try ( vegetarian dishes ) porotos con riendas , porotos granados , humitas con ensalada chilena y aj+ verde , charquic+n de cochayuyo , ceviche de cochayuyo , guiso de acelgas , tortillas de porotos verdes , fritos de coliflor , etc. ? I would like to know if you have any professional knowledge to give your opinion Did you work in a restaurant or been a food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best regards <p> Excuses excuses . Why cant Chileans just accept that their cuisine sucks ? There is little gastronomy culture in Chile . All the dishes you mentioned are rarely cooked by the traditional families . Porotos con riendas ? really ? that is the most basic dish ever ! I 100 % echo the sentiments of the author , and as stated above , I am chilean . Lived there for 7 years , and ate all that type of food . To me its just incredibly bland and boring . <h> Comment navigation 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142941 @2542941/ <p> Eilat is basically a resort town , and I was shocked surprised at first about how touristy it was when we arrived there just in time for sunset and went for a stroll along the promenade , which was filled with people who were doing the same thing . It reminded me of a lot of European beach resorts with its long beach promenade which was lined with massive hotel complexes , restaurants and shops that sold everything tourists could possibly need.But I had found a lovely hotel which had only recently opened ( I would definitely recommend it in my Hotel Tip category , but I was on vacation after all , and so I refrained from taking my camera out while I gorged on the glorious breakfast buffet every morning . I am not exaggerating when I say that its one of the best breakfast buffets I 've ever had . You can book Hotel Soleil via Booking.com , which is where I had found it ) and Eilat might be touristy , I was here to relax for a couple of days and go for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt , Israel only gets to call a tiny part of the Red Sea to call their own , but they 're using it well . Eilat is not only a popular vacation spot with foreigners but also with Israelis , even though it is quite far from everywhere , separated from the heavily populated north of the country by the massive Negev Desert . When we drove down to Coral Beach the next day I understood why it was such a popular vacation spot.Upon arrival , we paid the entrance fee for the nature reserve and rented snorkeling equipment , and while I was a bit disappointed at first by the rocky beach , I quickly understood what this was about : the underwater life , and not the beach ! I 've never been to a place where the reef is as close to the shore as it is in Eilat , and at this part of the beach you cant even just walk into the water because it is part of a protected nature reserve . Instead , a couple of long piers have been built over the coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stairs at the end of them right next to the reef.My first thought when I stepped into the water was how cold it was ! The Mediterranean and the Dead Sea had both felt like a bath tub in comparison , and especially after a long hot summer and the proximity to Egypt , combined with the sweltering heat , I would have expected the Red Sea to be much warmer.When I turned towards the reef though , the shock about the cold water was forgotten in an instant I was wowed by the coral and the beautiful fish instead . I could n't believe how much marine life was happening here , so close to the shore ! I also could n't believe that I did n't  have an underwater camera to document it.I tried to take some photos from the pier , but just imagine what these would look like had I had an underwater camera . I even saw tropical fish like parrot fish and clown fish here ! <p> There were more colorful and bigger fish than I 'd seen on any other snorkeling trip , and entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't even there . While I had been a bit skeptic at first if the money for the beach and the snorkeling equipment was worth it ( NIS35 /US$9 admission , NIS30 /US$7.72 gear rental ) , I was now ecstatic about the reef life I got to see without having to dive . In my head , I was already planning to bring my nephew here to introduce him to this mesmerizing , colorful underwater world , and did n't  want to leave water anymore.This experience alone made driving down to the most southern tip of Israel worth it , and combined with some beach time and surprisingly good food , I left Eilat just the way I wanted : completely recharged and ready to see more of Israel . 129333 @qwx989333 <p> How to get there <p> The cheapest way to get to Eilat from Tel Aviv is taking the Flo Shuttle , a daily door-to-door shuttle service for only $17 . <p> Where to stay <p> Eilat has accommodation ranging from basic backpackers hostels to 5* resorts ( the Dan Hotel ) .

CafeCafe also has lots of vegetarian food and good coffee . <p> Where to go <p> From Eilat , you can visit the spectacular rock formations in Timna Park ( 30 mins north of town ) or hike in the Harei Eilat ( Eilat Mountains ) Nature Reserve for superb views over both Eilat and Aqaba in Jordan . For both places I recommend visiting in the early morning or it will get too hot . <p> Beaches : Do n't  miss Coral Beach , and I also liked Dekel Beach where you can hang out on a floating beach bar in the Red Sea . You can take bus 15 from the city center to both these beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142942 @2542942/ <h> Why I love train travel in Europe <p> When I decided to take trains around Europe whenever possible last month , I was curious to see how theyd compare to buses , which I had used during my travels in August . <p> What I discovered ? Just how much I love train travel . I 've always enjoyed train travel , but a month of using trains almost exclusively reminded me how pleasant train rides are.Here are some of the reasons why I think trains are the best way to get around Europe : <p> Trains are super comfy , fast and on time : After spending a lot of time on buses in August , I truly appreciated the comfort of train travel there is more leg space , there is room for your luggage right above your seat , the seats are more comfortable . Most importantly though : trains are so much faster than buses ! No traffic jams , no delays ( for the most part , at least ) and traveling at high speed makes train travel much faster than buses . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed trains I took in Italy . In Germany , the trains even went as fast as 250 kilometers per hour ! Depending on the route , train travel can be as fast flying , from Venice to Munich for example : getting to the airport takes about an hour , calculate two hours for check-in and security checks , the flight time ( 1hr ) itself and the travel time from the airport into the city ( another hour ) , and you could be traveling comfortably on a direct train instead , which takes you from city center to city center and takes about the same time.There are tables to sit at : One aspect where trains beat planes and buses are the tables that you find in each cart . Not every seat comes with a table , but when I reserve a seat in a train , I usually ask for a seat at a table . That way I can work on my laptop , have space to put food or a cup of coffee or place my camera ( which on some train rides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : For me it is amazing to be able to charge my devices , and since we are using our smartphones for pretty much anything , which means we drain our batteries fast , these plugs are getting a lot of use these days . <p> The bathrooms are much nicer than those on buses : I do n't  even want to talk about bathrooms on buses But I was surprised that every time I had to use a bathroom on a train , it was much cleaner than one might expect .. or maybe that 's because I still had the images of bathrooms on Indian trains in my head ? There was always toilet paper , hand towels and soap and they seemed to be cleaned regularly.You can bring as much stuff as you want : Planes have carry-on restrictions and even transnational bus companies in Europe have started to set up luggage restrictions . On a train , however , you can bring all the stuff you want , including things like pocket knives or corkscrews which you cant bring on a plane ( unless you check them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be out of your sight in the belly of the bus , whereas on a train , all your stuff will be in the cart with you.Centrally located stations : Train stations are right in the city center whereas bus stations are often a bit further away . I hate arriving in Berlin by bus for example , where the train station is way out west , and it takes me another 40 minutes to get to the city center . But when you get off a train , you are usually right in the center of town . <p> Train stations are amazing : Most cities have giant , modern , clean train stations with great food and coffee shops so that you can fuel up for the journey . Try to find good food in a bus station ! There are no traffic jams : Travel on a bus in Europe in the summer and I guarantee you that you 'll find yourself in summer holiday traffic sooner or later . And remember that most buses in Europe do n't  have AC ! <p> Most trains have table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a waiter will come around with coffee and snacks for purchase . In Italy , TrenItalia even had a special offer for a sandwich , a pastry and a coffee for G3.50 , which is an amazing deal ! You can bring a bicycle for free : Now this is n't important for most travelers but if you 're bringing your bike on your Euro trip , its much easier to take it on trains than on buses , and most importantly : it 's free ! I once paid G9 to bring my bike on a bus and I had paid G8 for my own ticket , less than for the bike ! - Train trips are easy : How many times have I been to really confusing bus stations ! Or even worse : My connecting bus was leaving from a different station ! But it is easy to find connecting trains at a station , signage is clear and announcements are made in English ( not always the case in buses ! ) . <h> Planning a Euro train trip <p> Speaking of how easy train travel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RailEurope app ( download here for iOS / download here for Android ) throughout my trip , and I highly recommend it no matter if you are traveling with a rail pass or without one . Not only does the app show timetables and all available connections to your destination , but it also has interesting country facts and city maps of all major European cities . A rail pass is the easiest way to get around Europe , because it buys you a certain number of trips in a specific time period this can be anything between 3 travel days in a month within one country or an entire continuous month of train travel across 30 European countries there 's a big range of options which you can check out here . One country passed start at G57 Euros , global passes start at G192 for people under 25 , and G413 for people older than 25 . If you plan to cover a lot of ground , the global pass is certainly worth it it saves you the hassle to book all your train rides individually with each countrys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a train ( sometimes you have to reserve a seat and pay a small fee for the seat reservation though ) . - If you decide to travel around Europe by train without a rail pass , make sure not to just show up at a train station . In Europe it is always cheaper to book your train ticket in advance sometimes you can save up to 70% ! Book your ticket online as soon as you know where you 're going and when . <p> Are you a fan of train travel , too ? 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 5 Comments <p> I absolutely adore traveling by train its something we do n't  do enough of in North America . You definitely outlined all of the reasons that train travel is the best ! I seriously ca n't wait for my next opportunity ! <p> Thanks , Kate ! I wish train travel in North America was more efficient but some routes are so scenic I 'd still go on a long train trip across the country . Almost went from Seattle to Spokane this summer but then my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that train trip soon ! <p> These are exactly the reasons I love train travel too . Big comfy seats are the best . The US is n't as big on trains . However next month I 'm embarking on an epic American train trip . Portland , Oregon to Portland , Maine . Coast to coast . Super excited <p> I love trains in Europe too . They are super-convenient and can connect me to almost anywhere . And let 's not forget the ubiquitous Internet wifi connection and power socket " not on every trains , but a lot of them has " which made my traveling really convenient . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142943 @2542943/ <p> Bright lights , loud music , pool parties , gambling and people on vacation who are enjoying massive casinos , giant buffets and air-conditioned shopping malls . That 's what usually comes to mind when you think of Las Vegas . Las Vegas , New Mexico could n't be more different from its bigger cousin of the same name in Nevada . <p> We were driving up to Las Vegas from Roswell , a town I had mixed feelings about , and were stopping here primarily because it seemed like a convenient place to interrupt the long drive from Roswell to Albuquerque . Plus , I had read somewhere that it was a picturesque town with an old Wild West vibe , which is why I wanted to check it out . The hotel I had found , the Historic Plaza Hotel ( full review here ) , looked promising , but apart from that we did n't know what to expect . <p> Arriving at the hotel was already an experience in itself . Sitting on the North West end of the main town square , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure around here . We rolled up right to the hotel where we could park outside for free right on the square ( gasp .. does that even still exist ? ! ) and when we walked through the historic entrance doors it felt like we had stepped back straight into the late 19th century . I expected posh ladies in flowing satin dresses waiting in the lobby for their carriages to be loaded , sipping on a glass of champagne while their servants were loading up the luggage and getting the horses saddled . <p> We did n't spend much time in the hotel though " instead , we headed right back out to explore Las Vegas " what we had seen so far , was so much more charming than we 'd expected . The town square , Plaza Park , was where the town had been founded in 1835 , following the typical Spanish-colonial model . The green space is filled with leafy trees and wooden statues , all centered around a gazebo in the middle of the park where a Mexican mariachi band was playing live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most popular movie locations in the South West for any kind of old-fashioned Wild West movie . The entire town seemed like one big movie set ! At the same time , it felt so unpretentious and it is rare that you find yourself in a place that transports you back into another era in such a genuine way , without even trying ( I am looking at you , Tombstone ! ) . <p> We found ourselves walking straight into Plaza Antiques , a quirky antiques and vintage store where we were greeted by two sleepy cats and the friendly owners who happily chatted with everyone in the store . I love this about small towns people always show interest in visitors and enjoy conversing with strangers instead of feeling forced to make small talk . <p> Being in a store filled with so much memorabilia and delightful little trinkets while we had a car that allowed us to buy stuff and actually be able to transport it home was too tempting , however , so we left quickly and walked down to Bridge Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides . It really couldnt be any quainter and the parked SUVs feel completely out of place . Again , horse carriages would have felt more fitting . <p> The preservation of historic buildings in Las Vegas is part of the New Mexico Main Street program , an initiative founded by the state in 1985 to revive abandoned main streets and town centers throughout New Mexico , which focuses on bringing town squares and the surrounding streets back to live while preserving historic buildings , maintaining their original facades and architectural features.It seems like everybody in Las Vegas knows each other , and the community spirit comes across in the Main Street Program in which the renovations are mainly done with the help of volunteers . Everybody comes together to help paint storefronts and clean up homes that are about to get restored . <p> Located only 70 miles east of Santa Fe , you would think that more visitors make their way to this little town , but Las Vegas is overlooked by most New Mexico visitors a true hidden gem , even though you can barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , the town became an important point along the Santa Fe Trail , a historic route between Missouri and New Mexico that transported people and goods before the railroad arrived in 1879 . <p> The arrival of the train line led to an even bigger growth and an influx of different cultures from the east coast . With those , new architectural styles came to Las Vegas , diversifying the design of the buildings around town greatly . While the town had originally been set up in classic New Mexico style , with small adobe homes and a big Indian influence , the late 19th century saw a wide range of architectural styles being added to the cityscape of Las Vegas : in some parts of town , Victorian houses dominate ; in others you 'll see Queen Anne , Mission Revival and Italianate buildings . Most of these buildings are still intact today , and over 900 buildings here are now listed on the national Register of Historic Places ! <p> We let a free map that is handed out by the Visitor Center guide us ; it outlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different historic districts . In addition to the Park Plaza and Bridge Street District and the Railroad District , the Douglas/6th Street is a third historic district . <p> Around Carnegie Park we found many impressive Victorian buildings , some lovingly maintained by private residents , others housing B&amp;Bs , and the beautiful neo-classical Carnegie Library in a lovely setting right in the middle of the park . You could see how well Las Vegas did at the turn of the 20th century " the little town even had an electric tram system back then . <p> While the town boomed when the railroad put it on the map for the important East-West trade , its glory faded just as quickly when rail travel for both goods and people was replaced by interstate highways and travelers would bypass Las Vegas on the I-25 just south of it . <p> As little as the fa+ade of the town might have changed over the past one hundred years , behind the scenes a lot is happening with new businesses like the Old Town Drafthouse micro-brewery or art galleries arriving and after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand but now abandoned Casta+eda Hotel near the train station will also be restored and open its doors again soon . Once the hotel reopens its door , the surrounding historic railroad district will also benefit from it and hopefully see more independent bakeries , cafes and galleries open their doors here . <p> If you happen to be in the area , make sure to stop in this little town . No matter if you plan a New Mexico road trip or travel across the country , you wont regret visiting Las Vegas . At just over 15,000 inhabitants , the town is tiny . You can easily take in most of the town in half a day stroll around the historic districts , have a meal in the Rialto or Charlies Spic &amp; Span Cafe or enjoy a drink in Byroon T.s Saloon ( see below for details ) . <h> If you go <p> Sleep <p> Staying at the Historic Plaza Hotel was a fantastic experience , and we found a great deal on Booking.com ( $89 for a double room ) . <p> For a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel . It offers the perfect Wild West experience and you can mingle with both other visitors and locals . <p> The Old Town Drafthouse on Bridge Street is a microbrewery that makes an excellent pale ale . <p> Right next door is the Rialto , a classic New Mexican restaurant ( sadly for us , very meat-focused , but everybody kept recommending it us , so it must be good ) . <p> Do <p> Head to the Visitors Center for the free Las Vegas map and visitors brochure and visit the historic homes and districts . Stroll down Bridge Street and take in the beautiful architecture , and pop into the shops along the street . <p> The City of Las Vegas Museum &amp; Rough Rider Memorial on Grand Avenue ( open Tu-Sa 10am to 4pm and ( 10am to 4pm on Sundays May-September ) is free and has exhibits on the local history , the city 's famous residents and the Santa Fe Trail . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Every single one of your photos depicts exactly how I imagined an old west town to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I really love the look of those heritage houses or should I say mansions . I 've never heard of the other Las Vegas before but youve certainly put it on my map . <p> I love the architecture very Wild West ! It is so great that the locals all work together via the Main Street Project to volunteer their time to improve their City . I would love to go to New Mexico one day so will definitely keep Las Vegas in mind = <p> I 'd never heard of Las Vegas before . It looks so cool ! I love all the old buildings and the fact that its so full of history . There 's just something about small towns like this that I find endlessly fascinating . <p> I had never heard of it either ! It is a much overlooked little gem ! We found that with most of the little towns in New Mexico though , they 're all really pretty and charming . Silver City was another example . <p> What a terrific story/review .

The smothered green chile chicharone ( chee-char-oh-neh ) burritos are the best in New Mexico and Tome on the Range Book Store across the street is a Northern New Mexico favorite . The true secret of Las Vegas Grandes beauty is situate 16 miles southeast ( 8 miles south of NM Highway 104 , the lower Gallinas River valley . My family came from there ( Caon del Agua , Chaperito , La Liendre ) in the 1870s . Looking forward to your next visit there and review ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142944 @2542944/ <h> 33 Things We Love About Lisbon <p> Lisbon turned out to be one of our favorite places so far on our travels , so after three weeks in the Portuguese capital , finding thirty-three things to shout out over the rooftops was easy ! <h> 1 . The yellow trams <p> Similar both in look and feel to the San Francisco trams , these beautiful yellow trams serve as a very useful public transportation system spanning the central city area . The older street car trolleys continue to connect the coastal areas to the high up hilltop neighborhoods , while the trams travel across town on the streets at sea level . Most are slightly aged but in full working order ( like much of Lisbon , actually ) and they are lifesavers for getting you up and down the steep hills in comfort . The Number 28 route has become the de facto tourist tram , as it circles the city center . You 'll see tourists seated on the wooden benches , hanging out of the open windows with their cameras , while the locals have tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 2 . Multicultural make-up <p> Lisbons mighty maritime history in the 15th to 19th centuries means that Portugal gained several colonies throughout the centuries . The effects of this can be seen in the cultural make up of its capital city today , which , along with more recent immigrants from all over Europe and further afield , make Lisbon a culturally rich cosmopolitan city . <h> 3 . Vinho Verde <p> Despite its name , Vinho Verde or green wine , is not green at all . It is a light white wine , made of green grapes , and is one of Portugals specialties along with the more globally known Port wine . At G7 a bottle in the restaurant and much less in the store , there is no excuse not to try this delicious Portuguese wine . <h> 4 . Cascais train ride <p> Cascais is the biggest beach town just outside of Lisbon , and it could not be easier to get there . The train leaves from central Lisbon and glides along the coast , with several stops throughout the various beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to get to the beach , this sunny ride got me right in the mood for a day of ultimate relaxation ! Make sure to ride on the left side of the train when traveling from Lisbon to Cascais for the best beach views . <h> 5 . Santa Justa Elevator <p> Lisbon is built on seven hills , and climbing this multilevel city can get tiring , especially without car . Raul Mesnier de Ponsard , a Lisbon native born to French parents , Mesnier served as an apprentice to Gustav Eiffel , and brought the inspiration from the construction of the tower home and applied them with the Santa Justa lift . The lift was commissioned and created to facilitate the movement of people from down in the Baixa section up to Carmo Square . The design is intricate , beautiful , and the lift itself is free , but for just G1.50 , you can climb the stairs to the top of the elevator for great views over Lisbon . <h> 6 . Cheap bakery breakfasts <p> Within a one-minute walk from the door of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Portuguese bakeries . While we are sure that plenty of people in Lisbon eat breakfast at home , people are pouring out of these pastelerias , all of them , each morning . We ordered a double espresso and one of the many delicious pastries for around G2 to start our day sugar shocked and uber-caffeinated ! You can take a look at some of our favorite breakfasts in Portugal here . <h> 7 . The views <p> In Lisbon , there are views just about everywhere , from hilltops to hotel rooftops , plus countless parks and even from the castle . My favorite place for a view was to climb the streets up to the Miradouro e jardim do Torel viewpoint which is a little park in a residential area just off the Avenida da Libertade . The benches were so comfortable , and the trees provide a breezy , cooling shade . Even on days of intense summer heat , this park is the perfect spot to have a coffee and read a book while the rest of Lisbon is baking below . <h> 8 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Berardo Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art has a great collection of the worlds biggest artists of the 20th century- Warhol , Picasso , Dali , Duchamp , Magritte , Mir+ , - Jackson Pollock and many more . And the best thing : the museum is always FREE . <h> 9 . The beaches <p> We just cant get enough of the beaches in Lisbon . The city itself is lined with coastline , along the Tagus River and the Atlantic Ocean " which can be reached by car , train , bike , bus or GoCar within minutes . A second option for more beaches lies just across the 25 de Abril bridge ( the Golden Gate Bridges twin ) . A ten minute ride once across leads to the Costa da Caparica and miles and miles of Atlantic Ocean beach access . Both areas have a laid-back beach culture , surfing , and plenty of great restaurants to keep everyone fed and happy . <h> 10 . Pasteis de Nata pastries <p> These pastries are a Portuguese institution , and one of Danis favorite sweets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custard filled pastries , with cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top . <h> 11 . Coffee <p> They love their coffee in Lisbon , and while walking the city streets , an espresso is available just about every 50ft . Known locally as bicas these super strong espressos kept us buzzing all day long . <h> 12 . Sagres and Superbock beers <p> We kept that buzz going at night as well , with these two popular Portuguese brews . Both are light , crisp , and delicious cold " which after a day in that sizzling Lisbon sun feels gooooood. <h> 13 . Sculptures everywhere ! <p> Lisbon is filled with sculptures the biggest one being the Cristo Rei statue in the Almada neighborhood on the left-bank of the Tagus River , a giant stone Jesus Christ figure , which is overlooking Lisbon and was inspired by the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro , but you will come across bronze and stone sculptures everywhere in the city , including the magnificent Padr+o dos Descobrimentos ( Monument to the Discoveries ) in Belem , and a gigantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VII Park . <h> 14 . Tiled houses <p> The tiles of Lisbon are what help to maintain that intensely old school charm of this capital city . The buildings and sidewalks are both covered in tiles , and form designs or patterns , or even larger murals . <h> 15 . Bairro Alto &amp; Chiado <p> This area of Lisbon is a combination of bohemian creativity and classic luxury . A place where art museums and fusion restaurants meet live music and old-world wine and whiskey bars . If we lived in Lisbon , this is where we would go out for all occasions . <h> 16 . Indian Restaurants <p> Goa , India was a Portuguese territory until the mid 20th- century , and one culinary result is that Lisbon has over 50 Indian restaurants in the city and counting ! We could n't have been happier with the Indian food as it was both vegetarian and delicious . In factwe managed to eat at a different Indian restaurant almost every single night , and no , it was n't healthy . But it was good ! <h> 17 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trolleys , the sleek super quiet trams , the buses which provide a great tour for the price of bus fare , or the fun ferries which cross the Tagus river " but do n't  forget about the fully functional , easy , clean subway system . Our hotel entrance was at the top of the Almirante Reis exit , so we took the subway often and found it to be very convenient . <h> 18 . Ponte 25 de April <p> We 've mentioned it before , but we just love how this twin of the Golden Gate only one of many similarities to San Francisco adds an extra touch to the classic beauty of the skyline . <h> 19 . Affordable prices <p> From food and transport to clothing and tourist attractions , Lisbon is a fabulously affordable city . The capital is home to some of the finest theater and hotels , but the luxury here seems present , but muted Lisbon is also the most no-fuss capital we have visited and can easily be done on a budget . <h> 20 . The Alleys of the Alfama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic area of the city . Built upon dense bedrock , the Alfama survived the 1755 earthquake , which makes a visit to this area like a trip back in time . Stepping through the narrow medieval cobblestone areas brought us to tiny squares , inside mystic churches , and past whitewashed houses decorated with colorful flowers and laundry hanging out to dry . <h> 21 . Survival of the mom-n-pop restaurants <p> If we ate seafood , then it would surely be on this list of thirty three things we love , since Lisbon and all of Portugal is known for its fresh , delicious seafood . And although do n't  eat seafood ( or meat ) , we can appreciate the way it is sold and eaten here in Lisbon . Even in expensive downtown real estate , streets are lined with family-owned shops and restaurants open for generations . Shops specialize in specific products " fabric , yarn , bags , antique books , florists , tools and , of course , seafood . Its a great feeling to pay someone for an item and know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ( inter ) national chain . <h> 22 . Wine and whisk(e)y in wooden boxes <p> Continuing along our love of the old school style of Lisbon and the survival of the mom-n-pop , we love peeking in to the dimly lit downtown booze shops which still sell dusty bottles of wine and whiskey packed individual in wooden boxes . <h> 23 . Santo Domingo church <p> Its nondescript facade hides one of the most beautiful churches we came across in Europe during this trip , and believe us , we have seen a ton of churches ! The salmon-colored walls are so unusual , the detail on the many statues and columns incredible . We do n't  actually attend church , but wed go back to this one again any time ! <h> 24 . Docas The Santo Amaro Docks <p> Under the 25 de Abril Bridge in the Alcantara area of Lisbon between Baixa and Belem , former warehouses now house a string of bars and restaurants which now overlook a trendy yacht marina . You can eat everything from Tapas and Mexican to traditional Portuguese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the lights twinkling on the water at night . <h> 25 . Bike path to Belem <p> The 7km cycle path along the coast leads from the downtown train station to the area of Belem , and is a flat , easy ride under the 25 de Abril Bridge , past countless trendy bars and restaurants and toward some of Lisbons most popular and significant tourist attractions . <h> 26 . Baixa <p> This area is the heart of downtown Lisbon . Its beautiful , wide squares and great shopping streets were re-built after the earthquake of 1755 leveled the city . The neo-classical architecture today houses some modern shops , but several of these downtown store fronts are still run by sole retailers selling hand-crafted goods and services . Baixa is the main area for public gatherings in Lisbon as well . <h> 27 . Street Art <p> Cities with great street art always win our hearts , and parts of Lisbon are like outdoor art museums , with eye-catching , intellectual street art . <h> 28 . Avenida da Libertade <p> This central , tree-lined boulevard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is the main shopping street and thoroughfare for parades in the city . The Libertade is known as Portugals equivalent of the Champs Elysees in France , and with its luxury shops , it sure feels that way . <h> 29 . Queijo mesti+o de Tolosa <p> As we do in any European country , we grabbed a bottle of red wine , a freshly-baked baguette and this delicious soft white mesti+o de Tolosa cheese and had a picnic in the Jardim do Ultramar . At some point , we ran out of bread , and then out of wine , but we kept right on nibbling at this excellent cheese anyway " so good ! <h> 31 . GoCar Tours <p> Exploring the town from the view of a little yellow GoCar is a great way to see Lisbon . Read what we thought about our Lisbon GoCar Tour , and if you are on your way to Lisbon , you can book a Gocar tour here . <h> 32 . Portuguese style <p> Lisbon residents are a handsome bunch . Golden brown from the summer sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people here have the bodies to pull off tight , short and barely-there attire " but no one does . Instead , the style is much more natural and comfortable . Men wear button-down shirts and linen trousers , while women wear long , flowing dresses/skirts and loose-fitting linen shirts . Overall this brings such a relaxed fashion sense to match the laid-back attitude and a lack of pretentiousness that we could really get along with . <h> 33 . A Ginjinha <p> Ginjinha is the name of a liqueur which infuses sour cherries in alcohol with sugar . This super sour shot burns its way down and does n't  taste all that pleasant at all " the pleasant part is that it shots are available all day long from A Ginjinha , essentially a gritty , singular market stall , right on Rossio Square . The wrinkly old Portuguese vendor slaps shot after shot on the counter for the continuous stream of locals and tourists who gather to spend five minutes with their cherry shot throughout the day . <p> If you enjoyed these 33 things check out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Its called green wine because in the mountains the grapes do n't  get really ripe , and making wine with those grapes gives the wine a natural carbonation . To me , it tastes like green apples and it has to be served really cold . <p> That 's exactly how we felt , too . We never even planned to go to Lisbon , just went on a whim , and now its a major favorite and somewhere well have to go back to . If our list gets any longer , well have to live to be 150 at least , definitely sympathize with you there ! Let us know if you do decide to go , we 'd love to hear all about it = <p> The first day I 've found your site and how very in teresting it is ! ! ! I 've always thought of going to Lisbon and now I 've seen your info its one of the places I must visit . It will be a great challenge because my husband is in a wheelchair and can only walk a few steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only option we do n't  mind because we know our limitations . <p> Thanks for the list of tips . I 've just come back from my first trip to Lisbon and could n't agree more , its a fantastic city ! I did n't  expect it to be so hilly but grew to love the steep cobbled streets and the great views when you reach the top . We only had a few days there and from your post I can see that there 's much more to discover . Will have to go back soon ! <p> Hey ! I 'm glad you loved Lisbon ! I 'm a portuguese student doing a master thesis on the touristic image of Lisbon . I 'm looking for foreigners that have visited Lisbon , so it would be a really good help , if you could fill in this survey . Thank you so much : ) <p> Its so nice to see someone talking about my city Yes , you cover a lot of but believe that is much more Well now I going to drink some " green wine " and get the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you like Lisbon just please do n't  go anywhere else in Portugal because you 'll fall in love and you 'll never want to leave this piece of heaven on earth . There 's so much more to see than just Lisbon and things are even more beautiful outside the obvious tourist places . <p> Hi Pierr , thanks for catching that we put the 19th instead of 20th century , that 's been corrected now . To clarify , if you spend some more time on our site , you will understand that we prefer to get out and around a city , not just in the downtown area . Cascais is outside of Lisbon , yes , but it is an easily accessible train trip , the start of which leaves right from Lisbon . Any visit to Cascais would likely be from Lisbon , so there is no reason not to include that in this round up . Second , there are no beaches IN Lisbon on the Atlantic , but again just a public bus ride across a bridge from the city , not an hour away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our readers understand that these are both excellent days out when spending time in Lisbon and something we most definitely recommend . <p> However when you write " we just ca n't get enough of the beaches in Lisbon " , you 're not talking about the city of Lisbon itself because there is n't a single beach in Lisbon . <p> Only the Tagus is around the city of Lisbon , not the Atlantic . <p> So you 're talking about other places near Lisbon . <p> You can travel to and from Cascais by highway without passing through Lisbon . <p> I feel exactly the same of what is written in point 13 : Lisbon is filled with sculpures , yes , that is true . But the Cristo Rei Statue is not one of them . so its not Lisbons biggest statue . <p> Its like saying the Statue of Liberty is New Jerseys biggest statue just because its close and you can see it from NJ but the geographical location of the Statue is New York City . <p> Cristo Rei statue is located in Almada and Almada is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its own Mayor and has nothing to do with Lisbon whatsoever . <p> I understand that someone can prefer to get out and around a city , but Lisbon is not only downtown . <p> My problem with the kind of lists is that you start by writing you love Lisbon but the list itself reflects other parts of the country , of which the only main connection with Lisbon is being close to it . <p> So you love Lisbon and Cascais and Almada and . Costa da Caparica , one parish of Almada located in the district of Setubal . <p> And Setubal is not even mentioned <p> Do n't  get me wrong but this list is not only about the city of Lisbon , but about the region of Lisbon . Those are different things <p> Ah , by the way , do n't  worry about the trams they are not that old at all . <p> Thank you again for your technical information . I hope that these tiny corrections about exact locations and informing the audience that there is a mayor of Almada make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrounding areas . <p> I appreciate you fact-checking all the way from Amsterdam , this must have been very important for you to get off your chest . I do hope that people reading this remain inspired to visit the city that we loved so much , which is really all we wanted to do with what is an inspirational piece . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Like a match made in heaven , I 've got a super sweet tooth and Portugal is famous for its delicious pastries . It was amazing to us just how many bakeries , or pastelerias there are in Lisbon . In fact , - just within 2 minutes walking from our guest house there were no less than SIX different bakeries , all filled with dozens of chocolate eclairs , Portuguese-style doughnuts , cakes , cookies , and- last but not least pasteis de nata , the signature pastry of Portugal . <p> Pastelerias are perfect for grabbing a quick espresso and a piece of cake when the tummy starts rumbling mid-afternoon , but they are the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street cleaners , housewives , grandmothers , mothers with children in short , the entire bustle of the city streets burst out of the bakeries while everyone has breakfast here before work or school . <h> And breakfast means sweets . Pastries ! <p> I could n't believe my luck a country where it is practically mandatory to eat sweets for breakfast ! What could be better than starting each day with sugary or chocolatey or creamy doughnuts ? Over the years Ive gotten Jess to like all kinds of sweets , which did n't  interest her in the least before she met me , but sweets for breakfast are still not really her thing , unless its granola or yogurt with fruit . <p> So we set off to find a bakery that also offered yogurt for breakfast , and after seven or eight bakeries , we were finally lucky this is what we found : <p> I 'll admit that her Greek yogurt with berries was delicious , but I was happy with my giant sugar-topped custard pastry , and we both had a Portuguese cappuccino called meia de leite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , and the next morning both of us ordered something sweet . So , instead we ordered a small sampling of a variety of pastries to get an overview of Portuguese baked goods : <p> Sugar overload ! My favorite pastry was the one on the top right , which was similar to a the national pastry pastel de nata . The pasteis de nata are small round flaky pastries filled with vanilla custard and topped with a mix of cinnamon and sugar . The flavor is unique , distinct and melt-in-your-mouth delicious . This is what they look like : <p> Does n't  this flaky dough crust look delicious ? ! My favorite pasteis de nata are still the original ones though . If you visit Portugal , you have to try them ! <p> After a few days , we grew tired of the same ol sweet breakfasts and just wanted some granola or a hearty breakfast . Not to be found though . Instead were- another sweet start into our day <p> This was actually a very good breakfast and the pastry with the sugar icing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the ones I ate my way through , and Jess also thought that her strudel was delicious . <p> The next morning , we got breakfast served along with 30 Seconds to Mars sugar sweet = ! <p> You may be seeing a pattern develop here . Morning after morning , pastry after pastry , with every day we spent in Lisbon , our pants got tighter and tighter , despite our daily hour-long eight-mile exploration walks through Lisbon Of course we did not eat pastries for the entire three weeks in Portugal even I got a bit tired of the sweet breakfasts , and at some point we switched them for fresh fruit in the morning . Next time we go to Lisbon , well need to tack on some ski holidays in France afterwards to work off all these calories ! <p> A sugar doughnut filled with custard , and a chocolate-covered vanilla custard dream The Portuguese really love their custard ! <p> Another custard-filled doughnut , a custard-filled eclair with sugar frosting , and a selection of cookies glorious ! <p> I could n't leave Lisbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , I went to the bakery and got the mini versions of my favorite pastries . Heaven on a plate ! Of course I finished them all and I cant wait to go back to Portugal for more <p> What about you are you a fan of sweet breakfasts ?

I bet that is all very delicious , I 'm currently searching for different recipes of famous foods around the world . <p> I love Portuguese pastries , but definitely not for breakfast . They also have such wonderful breads , so that 's usually what I have in the mornings when I 'm there . The pasteis de Belem are amazing ! But I like going for a post-lunch snack rather than first thing in the morning . <p> I usually prefer pastries as an afternoon snack , too , but I liked the energy boost they gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese from time to time , but we found the sandwiches quite bland at least the vegetarian ones . <p> Portuguese girl here ! Our breakfasts are crazy sweet , I know ! = Actually people tend to have breakfast at home more often than not ( were always on a budget ! .. ) and we would n't normally eat so many sweet things at home then : more like bread and butter , bread with cheese &amp; ham , coffee , milk , toast .. But yeah , outside , were all about the pastries ! And even if we do n't  have these for breakfast , well end up having them for " lanche " which is this made-up meal we have in the middle of the afternoon , with coffee and of course pastries ! What can I say ? Were very sweet people ! = <p> Hi Zara , I think that 's the case in most country British people do n't  have a full English breakfast every day either , or Americans do n't  eat pancakes and eggs every morning = I do n't  mind having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooooo good ! That just makes me want to go back to Portugal ! ! I miss the pasteis de nata = <p> Im do n't  usually eat a lot of sweets , but you ca n't leave Lisbon without sampling .

@@107142949 @2542949/ <p> With Memorial Day weekend just around the corner and the summer holidays coming up , I thought I 'd share my top tips on how to find cheap and good ! - accommodation around the world . <p> And to help you get away , I am giving away a $50 Hotels.com voucher which can be used towards any booking.One of the questions I get asked the most is how I always find such great deals on accommodation . I 've learned a lot over the last few years of travel , so here are my top tips on how to find great hotel deals online : <h> 1 Use Hotel Booking Websites <p> It is rare to find a hotel room that is offered cheaper on the hotels website than on a hotel search engine such as Hotels.com . I always double check before I book , but 95% of the time I find that the price offered on the various hotel booking websites beats the offer on the hotel 's website . Have a look around several websites , prices vary and sometimes one of these sites may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  have . <h> 2 Sign Up For Email Alerts <p> I 've signed up for the email newsletter of pretty much every booking website so that I know about their sales . Thanks to the newsletters , I always know which site has a general sale or a sale for a specific location , and they often send exclusive voucher codes for 20% off . Several sites also offer secret prices ' for their email subscribers . <h> 3 Make Sure You Know The Total Cost <p> Be careful though : Not all booking websites show the total price including taxes and possible fees , and depending on how much they are , they can add a substantial amount to the total price . Be careful to check the total amount for a room before hitting the Book ' button . Check out this deal for example : <p> $70 for a night at the popular Paris resort in Vegas sounds like an amazing deal initially , but once you click the Book Now button , you see all the extra charges added , making this less of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parking ( $10 per day ) , and this bargain ' turns into a rather pricey weekend . <h> 4 Use Reward Points <p> I hope you 're all using at least one credit card that offers reward points which can be cashed in for flights or hotels . If not : no worries , its not too late ! Head over to my post on How To Start Travel Hacking and join the travel hacking game . <p> Some hotels have their own hotel credit cards if you travel a lot and have a preferred hotel chain , it is well worth signing up for one of them . The Points Guy has a great article outlining the 7 Best Hotel Credit Cards . <p> When you decide to cash in points for a room , you can stay in some amazing hotels for free just make sure that its worth it and double check the going rates for the room via Google . Speaking of which : <h> 5 Use Google To Find Out Rates <p> This is particularly useful when you 're already set on a hotel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , and the U hotels in Bangkok , so whenever I already know which hotel I want to stay at in a certain destination , I consult Google to find out which booking website offers the best deal for the hotel of my choice . <h> 6 Use A Booking Engine That Offers Rewards <p> Speaking of collecting rewards if you cant do travel hacking ( if you 're based outside the US , for example ) , you can still collect rewards for booking with the same website every time you book a hotel . Hotels.com is once again a winner here , offering a free stay after every ten bookings made through the website ! <h> 7 Join A Hotel Rewards Program <p> Another option to collect reward points is to join a hotel loyalty program . Most of these loyalty programs do n't  only offer the option to collect points which can be used for free stays , but also offer freebies during a stay , like free wifi or a free upgrade to a better room category . According to this article , Wyndham , Choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 Bid For A Room Or Book A Mystery Room <p> If you enjoy gambling ( and winning ! ) , bidding for a room can be a fun game to play . Some of the booking websites give you the option to bid for a room . There 's even a website that helps you to put in the best bids and shows you what rooms in the category ( how many stars ) and in the neighborhood you bid for have gone for in the past . A friend of mine does this regularly and scored a room in a mid-level hotel in Midtown Manhattan for only $60 a night that 's an incredible bargain ! Read this article to get started bidding on hotel rooms . <p> The other option for adventurous travelers to save money on accommodation is to book a mystery room . With this option , you 'll only know what neighborhood the room is in and what amenities the hotel has , but you wo n't find out where you 're staying until after the booking is confirmed . I once ended up in The Kimpton in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this day one of my favorite hotels ever and I paid only $65 for it ! <h> 9 Book A Flight &amp; Hotel Package <p> If you have to fly to your destination , it 's well worth checking out hotel &amp; flight packages . Sometimes they work out a lot cheaper than booking your flights and hotel separately . When I flew from London to Las Vegas a few years ago , the hotel &amp; flight package I found was so much cheaper that I ended up booking that and not using my return flight to London but continuing my travels through the U.S. from there " that 's right , a return flight from the UK to Vegas plus the hotel cost me less than a one-way flight to Vegas and a hotel booked separately ! <p> I 've booked flight &amp; hotel packages several times , and they are especially a bargain for city breaks , for example in New York or New Orleans , or European city breaks in Barcelona or Rome . <p> Just make sure to check on the map where the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews " the most incredible bargains often include cheapie hotels outside of the city center , and those are n't worth the extra saving for me personally . As for review scores , I never book a hotel that has less than 4 out of 5 or 8 out of 10 review points . <h> 10 Stay In A Hostel <p> You may think of hostels as dingy and dirty budget accommodation , but trust me : Hostels have changed a lot in the past few years ! Luxury hostels ' are the latest trend , and no worries : you do n't have to stay in a dorm room hostels usually have private rooms these days . <p> My room in a hostel I stayed at in Brighton a couple of years ago was so fancy that I could n't believe I was actually staying in a hostel and not a boutique hotel . In pricy cities like Hong Kong , Sydney or New York , it is especially worth including hostel booking websites in your search and comparing the prices to the room rates of hotels . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What I also appreciate about hostels is that they often have nicer communal areas which makes it easy to connect with other travelers , and usually there is a kitchen , which is great to prepare a packed lunch or cook dinner .

@@107142952 @2542952/ <h> Why You Need To Visit Lombardy , In 20 Photos <p> Had it really been four years ? This question ran through my mind as I was watching the familiar sights of sprawling vineyards and tall cypress trees from the train . Yes , it had really been four years since I last went to Italy , a country that I list as one of my favorite countries in the world every time when asked to name my most beloved countries.And yet , my travels did n't  bring me here for years before my last visit in 2011 , and again it had taken me nearly half a decade to return , even though after my last visit , I had vouched to visit more often again . Because if I know one country well , it is Italy , with about a dozen visits under my belt . Thinking about it , it is probably the country I 've visited more often than any other country . The Amalfi Coast , Tuscany , Rome and Liguria I know them all so well . And yet , even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy to see : Puglia , Emilia Romagna , Calabria , Abruzzo , Sicily and Sardinia , to name just a few , are all places I have yet to explore . And the north , which I passed through so many times when driving down from Germany somehow I never stopped there , despite glorious tales of beautiful alpine mountain trails and famous lakes like Garda and Como . So when I was invited to get to know Milan and Lombardy , a region in northern Italy , I jumped at the chance . And when I finally laid eyes on Lake Garda , I could n't help but ask myself : What took me so long ? Why did n't  I come here earlier ? <p> I am not sure why the north does n't  get as much attention as famous regions further south , because every place I went to was gorgeous and had something special to it . <p> Which is why I thought I 'd introduce you to Lombardy with the favorite pictures of my trip , showing you why this part of Italy is well worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lombardy might not have any access to the Mediterranean , but now that I spent some time there , I say : it does n't  really need it ! With famous lakes like Como and Garda , and lesser known but not less stunning lakes like Maggiore or Iseo , Lombardy still has plenty of beaches . I loved the small towns that dot the lake shores they usually come with a picturesque promenade , colorful buildings , plenty of sidewalk cafes and lots of gelaterias. <h> 2 Lake Garda sunsets <p> Who needs beach sunsets when you can have sunsets like this ? ! Lake Garda really showed off while I was visiting , coloring the sky in some the most vivid colors possible none of the tourists who were meandering up and down the promenade could simply walk by everybody pulled out their camera or cell phone to take pictures . A true show stopper ! - <h> 3 Hidden gem #1 : Brescia <p> I had never heard of Brescia before I visited the city , which turned out to be home to the most significant Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The big university city still manages to feel like a small town in its historic core , and there are enough architectural highlights to fill a photo essay on their own : striking churches , beautiful piazzas , grand mansions , castles and the famous Santa Giulia monastery . The best part ? There were barely any tourists in town ! <h> 4 History alive <p> Brescias historical heritage is among the most significant in all of Italy . There 's the 8th century Santa Giulia monastery which now houses a museum of epic proportions : here , you find a collection of over 11,000 items spanning artifacts from prehistoric times , antiquity , the Lombard Age , the Carolingian Age and Venetian ages . You could spend an entire day wandering the 12,000 square meter large museum , but wait .. there 's more ! Brescia is also home to the oldest Roman ruins in northern Italy , and wandering the streets you 'll stumble across a well-preserved Roman Capitolium ( Roman temple ) , forum and theater . I was lucky enough to be one of the first visitors who got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the museum , which transformed the ruins into the magnificent buildings they once were . It made me wish I wouldve had glasses like those when I hopped from ruin to ruin in Rome and Pompeji what a spectacular feature and way to bring a place back to life ! - <h> 5 The scrumptious regional cuisine <p> I ate so much good food in Lombardy that I was seriously concerned about fitting in my dirndl I was heading straight to Oktoberfest in Munich from here ( in case you 're wondering : the zipper just closed and I tried not to breath all day ) . I could easily post 20 photos of the meals I devoured , but the food in Lombardy deserves its own post stay tuned for mouth-watering photos of all the ravioli , gnocchi , pizza , polenta , risotto and pastries I stuffed myself with . Pictured below are some of the best gnocchi I ever had topped with truffles ! <h> 6 Hidden gem #2 : Bergamo <p> Bergamo , another town I 'd heard of before coming to Lombardy , charmed me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a hilltop overlooking the plains around the Lower City and offering fantastic views all the way to the Alps and even to Milan which sits southeast of Bergamo . Historic Renaissance and Baroque architecture is plentiful here , and I loved the distinctly medieval feel of the Upper Town . <h> 7 Roman ruins with a view <p> The Grottoes of Catullus are the remains of a massive Roman villa , which belonged to the Latin poet Gaius Valerius Catullus . He sure knew to picked one of the best spots along the shores of Lake Garda , the Sirmione peninsula which The vast complex consists of the criptoportico hall ( famous for its sixty pillars ) , there is a triple window grotto , many well preserved pillars and arches and baths , plus a collection of items found on the site . <h> 8 Olives fresh from the tree <p> To be honest , I had no idea olives still grew that far north but you can find olive orchids throughout Lombardy and I loved having some fresh olives from the region with a glass of wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfasts may seem small and unassuming a cup of coffee and something sweet with it , usually a freshly baked pastry , like a brioche ( known as cornetto in the south of Italy ) , but these brioches are just to die for ! I 'm usually not a croissant person , but these heavenly , buttery , crisp on the outside and cake-y on the inside . Speaking of croissants I should n't have mentioned that word , because brioches do n't  like to be compared to their French counterparts . While similar , they 're not made the same way , and brioches can come simple ( without filling ) , or filled with jam , honey , custard or nutella . What a great way to start the day ! <h> 10 Milans many faces : The bohemian face <p> One of the reasons I wanted to go on this trip was because itd give me the chance to spend an extended period of time in Milan . Ill be honest here : I was n't all too fussed about Milan when I first visited Italys second biggest city in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelers . I knew that Milan deserved a second chance and I am glad I gave it another shot . I loved Milan the second time around , but telling you about all the things I discovered this time around would go beyond the scope of this post , so I 'll bring you a full article on the different faces of Milan I got to see . But let me at least mention a few of the things I loved about Milan : for one , its bohemian side in the Isola neighborhood , where the tree-lined boulevards and the grand buildings reminded me of Buenos Aires . <h> 11 Milans many faces : The hipster face <h> 12 Milans many faces : The historic face <p> And the historic side of the city , with remarkable columns , churches and of course the magnificent cathedral . <h> 13 Pastel colored towns and villages <p> This is one thing I love about Italy in general , and Lombardy was no different than the rest of the country : all of its towns have narrow streets lined with pastel colored houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <h> 14 UNESCO World Heritage ( lots of it ! ) <p> Lombardy is home to only 6% of Italys population , but it is home to 8 of the countrys 51 UNESCO World Heritage Sites , which is quite impressive and makes Lombardy in fact the region with the highest concentration of UNESCO sites in the country ! From the rock drawings in Valcamonica and the Sacri Montichapels to the combined site of the Longobords Places Of Power In Italy ( including- Brescias monastic complex of San Salvatore and Santa Giulia ) or the workers ' village of Crespi d'Adda , there are some really interesting UNESCO sites to be explored in Lombardy . <h> 15 Lakes meeting Alpine mountains <p> Tuscany might have rolling hills , but Lombardy has Alpine mountains that meet azure blue lakes ! Being on or by these lakes , surrounded by green mountains , some of them with snow-capped peaks , is a stunning sight . And different from the Alpine lakes further north , the lakes here benefit from a more Mediterranean climate , which means the water gets really warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <h> 16 Medieval castles <p> If you are a history buff and cant get enough of ancient castles , Lombardy is the right place for you ! With its many strategically placed hilltop towns , naturally there are lots of medieval castles that were built to protect the cities during the times when Italys regions werent as friendly with each other as they are today . I was impressed to see how well preserved most of them are ! <h> 17 Medieval towns- <p> This goes with #16 above its not just castles , cathedrals , palazzos and mansions that are well preserved in Lombardy you can find entire Old Towns all over Lomardy that still look pretty much what they used to look like hundreds of years ago . I often felt like I was stepping back in time and I know it sounds cheesy , but its true . <h> 18 Charming red roofs everywhere <p> I love getting a birds eyes view of a city , and in Italy I am usually in luck , since there seems to be a tower that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't  you agree ? <h> 19 A French Riviera vibe <p> Like I said Lombard does n't  even have access to the Mediterranean , and yet , in several of its lake side towns , I felt a Cote DAzur vibe . Maybe George Clooney felt that way too , and that 's why he bought a house on the shores of Lake Como ? Anyway I loved the sophisticated flair when I strolled down the wide , palm tree lined promenades , passing yachts in the water and elegant ladies with big sunglasses and hand fans in the cafes . The main difference between here and the French Riviera ? It is much less pretentious and much less expensive . <h> 20 Polenta e osei <p> This pastry alone is worth a trip to Bergamo , where this local specialty is from . Funnily enough it does n't  have any polenta in it , despite being named polenta e osei , but that 's because it looks like a perfectly mounded polenta . Its topped with marzipan and the black topppings resemble the osei , which means birds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lombardy ! As you write , the region is little known although it has so many beautiful places to visit . And there are more to discover ( ever for me , who lives in Milan ) , so you 'll have to come back ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

I 've traveled to many new countries since then , but few have been as diverse , breathtaking and memorable as Chile . I 've seen return flights from New York to Santiago on LAN Airlines for as little as $650 which made me almost buy a ticket but then I decided to continue my Latin- America explorations in the north instead to visit the countries I have n't been yet . Who knows though , maybe I 'll make it all the way down to Chile again when I fly to South America in a couple of months . <p> So what makes Chile so special ? I am sharing ten places with you that I am sure will blow your mind and I have to say that it was n't easy for me to cut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been following this site for a while , you know that i was pretty obsessed with the Atacama Desert . I loved San Pedro De Atacama , the little town right in the desert that had the weirdest combination of being a sleepy cowboy town with amazing gourmet restaurants and I couldve listed ten breathtaking places just from here : the geysers , the hot springs , the bizarre landscapes that make up the Atacama Desert . But Valle de la luna , Moon Valley , takes the crown , because where else in the world do you think you 're literally on the moon ? ? Ive been all over the world and with the exception of Iceland I have n't seen landscapes as otherworldly as here in Chiles Death Valley and the Moon Valley . <h> 2 Valparaiso <p> Valparaiso was my favorite city in Chile by far ! The city , which sits on 42 hills overlooking the Pacific , won me over with its terrific street art , brightly painted houses , cute restaurants and charming old-fashioned funiculars which would transport me up and down the steep hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're never far from a breathtaking mural . See more of Valparaisos colors here : - Live and in Technicolor : Valparaiso is Chile 's colorful cultural capital <h> 3 Chiloe <p> Ive been thinking a lot about Chiloe since I left the island , partially because of Mayas Notebook , an Isabel Allende novel I read earlier this year , which is partially set on Chiloe and does an amazing job in pulling you into the magic of this desolate , enchanting island ( buy it now , I promise you wont be disappointed .. Allendes story telling is , as usual , outstandingly beautiful , but you might end up buying a plane ticket once you 've finished the book , just to warn you ) . <p> The other reason Ive been thinking a lot about Chiloe is because its one of those places that you visit that never let you go , you leave part of your heart there . The lush , green island lures you in with its remote national parks , mystical stories about witchcraft , unique- palafitos ( houses mounted on stilts along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are over 150 strewn across the island , and 16 of which are UNESCO World Heritage sites. - To get a better idea of what I 'm talking about , read this article about my first meeting with Chiloe : A blind date with Chiloe. <h> 4 Torres del Paine <p> Torres Del Paine is one of the most spectacular places in Patagonia , named after its most impressive peaks , the three Towers del Paine . You can trek for days in the vast national park that has- a truly breathtaking scenery ranging from glaciers , azure lakes , rugged mountains , open steppe ( great for wildlife spotting ) and blue icebergs that cleave from the glaciers . The W Trek , its most popular trekking route , is a challenging multi-day trek that many count as one of the best treks in the entire world , and my biggest regret to this day is that I did n't  attempt the trek when I was down in Patagonia and visited Torres Del Paine . <h> 5 The Chilean Salt Flats <p> It might not be as famous as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bolivia , but the Chilean Salt Flats , the Salar de Atacama , is nothing short of stunning . At- 1,200 sq miles ( 3,000-km2 ) , the salt lagoon in the Atacama Desert is in fact the third largest salt flat in the world . The thick grey salt clusters are quite a different sight from a white salt flat , making it even more unique . The various lagoons here attract a large population of- Andean and Chilean- flamingos , adding yet another special feature . <h> 6 Tierra del Fuego <p> Tierra Del Fuego is a region that you 'll never forget the southernmost landmass of the Americas , it is shared by Argentina and Chile , but Argentinas part of the island is much more populated than the sparse Chilean side . With only 7,000 people , this is the least populated region of Chile , and calling Porvenir , the biggest settlement on the island , a town , would be an overstatement . This wind worn , barren- part of Chile truly feels like the end of the world , and its wide open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just how isolated Tierra Del Fuego is : we ended up hitchhiking to Ushuaia , the southernmost city of the world , from Porvenir , because there was no public transportation . Read the full adventure here : The day we hitchhiked to the end of the world <h> 7 Easter Island <p> Speaking of remote places Tierra Del Fuego and Chiloe are not the only remote places in Chile compared to to the mystic Easter Island , the other two are downright populous . The volcanic Easter Island is one of the most desolate places on earth , located in Polynesia , 2,182 miles ( 3,512 km ) from the Chilean mainland . The island , also known as Rapa Nui , is famous for its 887 magnificent moai statues undoubtedly Chiles best known UNESCO World Heritage site , erected by the Rapa Nui people between the 10th and 16th century . <h> 8 The Elqui Valley <p> The Elqui Valley is a narrow valley that stretches from the seaside town of La Serena all the way to the Argentine border ( with Chile being such a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) A beautiful sight during the day , its the nights when the Elqui Valley truly shines quite literally . Because of its cloud-blocking location the extremely dry Atacama Desert to the north and the Andes Mountains to the east the Elqui Valley is blessed with some of the best stargazing conditions in the world . Not only hobby astronomers flock here , but also astrophysicists from all over the world come here to study the stars . A night of stargazing in the Elqui Valley will take your breath away for sure . <h> 9 The volcanoes of the Lake District <p> One of the reasons I 'd love to return to Chile for ? The volcanoes ! I was super stoked about climbing the active Villarica volcano when I was in Pucon in Chiles Lake District , a region famous for its four picture perfect snow-capped volcanoes , each of one is perfectly cone-shaped . But during my time in the Lake District it was raining for days on end I could n't even see the volcanoes ! I 'd see them on a daily basis in the souvenir shops around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postcard . Even seeing them on paper left me speechless , which is why I hope I 'll get the chance to see them in real life one day . <h> 10 The Cerro Dragon Sand Dune <p> Chile truly has it all salt flats , deserts , volcanoes , beautiful beaches , mountains , picturesque towns , glaciers , geysers and giant sand dunes . One giant sand dune to be precise , the famous Cerro Dragon , or Dragon Hill , near Iquique , a seaside town in the far north of the country . The 2.5 miles ( 4km ) long sand dune is the largest urban sand dune in the world , and with heights varying- from 150 to 500 meters , only the Sahara Desert has higher sand dunes ! Its a spectacular backdrop for the town when you stand on the beach and face Iquique , you 'll always see the giant Cerro Dragon looming behind the skyscrapers of the city . And if you 're into sand boarding , you cant miss Iquique on a trip to Chile ! Have you been to Chile ? Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below ! 129336 @qwx989336 <p> You do need a lot of time to get around South America . If I were to go , I would try and start from Brazil , the go out in Uruguay , along Argentina until Tierra del Fuego , the back on the coast , zig-zagging between Argentina and Chile to see the beauties . After that , maybe a short trip to Bolivia and up to Peru , Ecuador and Colombia , maybe with a finishing point in Venezuela . I 've actually calculated during the holidays and on the fast mode , if I buy a second hand car and drive in all those countries , its going to be like 3-4 months . <p> But maybe I 'll win the lottery someday and I then can manage that = <p> I just saw this now , and I 've been thinking of a Latin America trip for a while . Chile is so beautiful ! Just have to save up because airfare to Latin America is going to be expensive from where I currently am ( Southeast Asia ) . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

I do n't think we 've ever spent that much time in a hotel room before , to be honest . But being horribly sick forced us to stay in bed for days on end , and I could n't imagine a better place for situation like this than Hostal CasArte . <p> Entering the hostal , you find yourself surrounded by freshly-painted bright white walls , typical for Sucre 's historic center , and by art . Lots of art . The hostal is family-owned , and the owners have done a great job transforming the historic buildings into a hostel maintaining Sucre 's unique character and add a funky vibe at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them double rooms , but there are are a couple of single and triple rooms , as well as an 8-bed dorm ) , the hostal has a cozy , quiet feel it never feels crowded and you actually get the chance to chat to the other guests in the courtyard or the lobby thanks to the intimate atmosphere at CasArte . <p> The rooms , which all have an ensuite bathroom , are bright and spacious , and most of them are reached via individual staircases , making them almost seem like independent apartments set around the courtyard instead of just ' rooms . <p> The high ceilings , original wooden framework and floors of the historic buildings have been maintained , and the rooms themselves are big enough to fit a king-size bed and still have enough space around the bed that Jess and I could have both done yoga at the same time ( which is something that would n't happen , since I just ca n't get into yoga " the more space for Jess though ! ) . <p> Every morning , breakfast is served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ) . Rolls , dulce de leche and jam are served buffet-style , and eggs , fresh fruit juice and fruit with yogurt were served to order . In addition , you can choose between several teas and coffee ( sadly , only instant coffee , but that 's the norm in Bolivia ) . <p> If you do n't want to go out and explore the town , you can just stay in the backyard and swing in a hammock while reading a book , or study Spanish at one of the tables " it seemed like there were quite a few Spanish students staying at the hostel while we were there . If you are looking to stay longer , CasArte offers special rates for weekly and monthly stays . <p> If you do want to explore Sucre though , the hostal is perfectly located at the southern end of the historic center and in walking distance to the main square , many restaurants and cafes , and all the museums and churches , the market and other sights Sucre has to offer .

Like in most of Bolivia , wi-fi is provided but does n't work very well . Our room was close enough to the reception to get some of the signal in the room ( or at least in parts of it ) , but most rooms do n't seem to have wi-fi reception .

This is definitely not a hostel for party people , but for travelers who appreciate a tranquil place with comfortable rooms on a quiet street . You will still get to chat to other people over breakfast or in the lobby , and the travelers we met all had a similar travel style to ours and we met some really interesting folks just not the typical backpacker crowd . <p> We found all of the staff to be very friendly and helpful , even though we had to remind them several times to clean our room . <p> Standout feature <p> The large , light and clean rooms with the wooden framework and wooden floors were something we were always looking forward to when we came back from our explorations . We 've rarely stayed in equally comfortable rooms in South America . Another plus : the hot showers with good water pressure , which are also something you do n't  take for granted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has them , you really appreciate it ! <p> Room for improvement <p> The rooms should be cleaned every day without guests having to ask for it ( considering that toilet paper is disposed of in a bin and not in the toilet ) and the wi-fi could be better , but that 's a common problem in all of Bolivia , so we cant really blame CasArte for that = <h> 8 Comments <p> Zab and I went to look at this place , but decided not to stay exactly because of the courtyard and the only rooms that were available were very close to the entrance so I was worried theyd be noisy when other guests came home ( later than us , since were usually in bed early ! ) Does look really nice , though ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Historic buildings like the cathedral , the opera house , the city palace and landmarks such as the TV tower or Brandenburg Gate become the canvas for stunning light projections ranging from abstract paintings to remarkable , innovative video installations . <p> This year I was finally able to plan a trip to Berlin around the festival !

@@107142957 @2542957/ <h> A former local 's guide to Antigua , Guatemala <p> My love affair with Antigua began in the year 2000 , when my best friend and I visited ( we were living in Costa Rica at the time ) and decided that the town was just so beautiful , moving there was a must . From 2001-2003 , I called the colonial city and former Guatemalan capital my home , during which time the love affair blossomed . I worked full time , lived a fairly normal life ( Antigua is far from roughing it ) , except that nearly every day , after greeting the Maya women weaving textiles in the park near my house , I would imagine where I stood on the world map , in what was once the capital city of all of Central America . <p> By 2003 , it was time to move on , but the love affair with Antigua never ended . Now , seven years later , in the bus from Guatemala City I felt jittery , excited and nervous to visit and see how things had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Guatemala City , I spotted through the window something most unusual . Mono Loco , always one of Antigua 's more famous gringo bars , had a big , bright , well-branded billboard on the side of the highway . Then we whizzed past an even bigger billboard for the Casbah , Antigua 's only nightclub ( both then and now ) . Billboards ? Advertisements ? Do n't things like that need budgets and marketing knowledge ? Back in the day , the bars , clubs and restaurants like Mono Loco were party places where the owner was just as likely to be hanging from the rafters as the clientele . We were all travelers , of the same ilk . Just as I was remembering a time when one such owner ( who shall remain nameless ) actually did hang wildly from a balcony back in 2002 , I glimpsed a second billboard for Mono Loco . Suddenly I realized that these owners were no longer ex-backpackers ; they are business owners , and they , like myself , were all grown up . <p> In terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also developed and matured . Back in the day , with great hostel choices , guaranteed hot water , excellent food choices , free movie nights and language schools , Antigua was always the spot where we dirty , grubby backpackers could clean-up , relax , eat some European or North American fare and prepare for the onward journey . Some ended up staying longer than planned , and several of my friends there had just ended up staying in Antigua all together . Today , young travelers still rule the tourist scene , but there are plenty of mainstream tourists now too , including families , older retired folks from the US , Canada and Europe , and even large tour groups from further afield , like Japan and China . The growing number of mid-range accommodation and three luxury hotels make Antigua much more welcoming for these visitors . <p> The increase in tourists , and the passage of several years , has meant that the old hang out spots are now dead , and new places have popped up and become popular . One night during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we go to Riki 's Bar to try to relive some of the madness that used to ensue here on a nightly basis . What happened instead was depressing . Imagine a birthday girl , hat on , waiting for guests to arrive and when they do n't , she eats the cake ( with her name misspelled ) all by herself . This was our Riki 's experience . The old hangout was dead . Rather than cry in our soup , we set off to discover the best places to eat , drink , relax and explore in Antigua today . My beloved Antigua might have changed , but we can still easily keep up . Read on for what we discovered . <h> Eating in Antigua Guatemala <p> As mentioned above , - Mono Loco is the typical gringo hang out , and a bit over-priced . But the burritos are huge and seductively delicious , as are the nachos , and just like at great Mexican restaurants at home , no Spanish is necessary here . For breakfast , head to the beautiful courtyard at- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long list of Guatemalan , American and International favorites . People-watching is also great here , where diners are a mix between middle class Guatemalans , poets , families , businessmen and backpackers . <p> For your sweet tooth , try the pasteleria ' , located on 2nd calle oriente between 4th and 5th Ave norte . We do n't  even know the name , but the courtyard , which is hidden from the street , is filled with locals who know that this is the best cake in Antigua . Try the banana chocolate cake and the cheesecake . For food as cheap as chips , stop at La Merced church on the weekends and special occasions for all the street food you can eat at $1.50 an item or less . <p> Directly across the street , tucked into a tiny space that could be easily overlooked , is the very special Hector 's restaurant ( rated #1 on TripAdvisor in Antigua for restaurants ) . For budget travelers this might be a budget-buster , but especially worth it for meat-eaters . The food is perfectly-prepared fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet the experience is not pretentious . Instead , Hector will spend time chatting to you , and although your wallet will be lighter , so will your spirits . <h> Movie Nights in Antigua Guatemala <p> For bagels , great coffee , free super-fast wi-fi and free movies every night of the week , Bagel Barn ( and now Bagel Barn II ) is there to please . Las Palmas restaurant takes the free movie night concept one step further . The restaurant , which also has a huge menu of decent international cuisine , shows three movies a day in a private movie room in the back . Should only your group show up for one of the movie times , they 'll let you choose any film you like from their massive movie library . <h> Drinking in Antigua Guatemala <p> Ask anyone where to go out in Antigua , and the answer will most likely be Reilly 's . This Irish bar had just opened before I left in 2003 , and from the start , Reilly 's Sunday pub quiz was a hit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with foreigners . La Chiminea is n't the party place it once was , but the space is big , the pool tables are fun , and the food and drinks are very cheap . For jazz , hang out at Ocelot , for dancing the overpriced La Casbah ( $4 cover charge , $5 drinks ) , which is big with people from Guatemala City , who drive their SUVs into town every weekend to dance here . The super cool El Afro has since been renamed La Sala , but is still as popular a watering hole as ever . This is a hard-drinking hang out bar with some drunken dancing late at night . <p> For a very trendy cocktail experience , head to Cargo Room , a little known restaurant/bar in the back of Lex Cargo 's fabulous jewelry shop . While most of the bespoke jewelry designs in the shop might be out of range for a budget traveler , let celebrity jeweler and local television star- Lex , who will greet you at the door and sweep you inside with his fabulousness , lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haters will love . Prices are similar to U.S. drink prices , but even just for one , the ambiance and a chat with the inspiring and elegant Lex is worth it . <h> What to do in and around Antigua Guatemala <p> In addition to all the enjoyable eating and drinking , the once earthquake-ridden city has countless ways to spend your days . Much of present-day Antigua was constructed in the 16th- century , and loaded with gorgeous ruins of cathedral and churches . Depending on your interest level , you could spend a day exploring the many ruins . Hike up to Cerro de la Cruz , the cross up on the hill that provides a perfect view of the colonial city , or for a view to Antigua 's interesting past , visit the gorgeous all-white San Lazaro cemetery at the southeast end of the city . Although we visited both places alone with no problems , we were warned that both can be dangerous alone , so go with a group , a guide or at least when there are many visitors . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antigua 's gallery row ' , a square block of art galleries with gorgeous original works by Guatemalan artists , including Alejandro Wer . <p> Outside of Antigua , visit nearby Ciudad Vieja or San Antonio Aguas Calientes for a glimpse of very traditional Guatemalan villages , or take one of the countless organized tours , including a climb up the ever-erupting Pacaya volcano or a visit to Finca Filadelfia or Finca Azotea coffee farm , to see how the delicious Antigua Guatemala coffee makes it from the farm to your cup . <p> If these activities get costly and run up your budget , there are several places with great views to relax and reflect . At the risk of alienating almost our entire readership with this next sentence , it is an insider 's tip ' we must share : Go to McDonalds . Really . The spacious courtyard at the Antigua McDonalds is a stunning garden filled with tropical flowers and hummingbirds , plus every table has a perfect view of the giant volcano Agua which looms over the city ( courtyard pictured below ) . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace restaurant and grab a drink , and for the ultimate in people-watching , order an ice cream at the delicious Marco Polo ice cream shop and people watch in Antigua 's super green central park . <h> Where to stay in Antigua Guatemala <p> If you are traveling with at least two people , we can recommend as highly as possible what we consider the best place to stay in Antigua : Yellow House . The 8 bedroom , two-dorm hotel and travel agency on 7th- in between the main market and La Merced is the best budget choice in town . Stay tuned for a full hotel review , but Yellow House ( review here ) has friendly staff , comfortable beds , cable TV , a large rooftop terrace with hammocks , couches and books , a kitchen , excellent wi-fi , the cleanest shared hot water showers we have found so far and the price includes a filling breakfast of porridge or pancakes , plus eggs , beans , potatoes , bread , sweet bread , fruit and coffee for Q150 or $18 per room per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antigua , with Jungle Party , The Black Cat and Ummagumma some of the more popular backpacker ' spots . Check on Tripadvisor before staying here though , as bed bugs were an issue not only for us , but for others as well . Do your shopping online first , and then comparison shop once you 're in town . It 's important to find a good place , since you may just end up here for awhile 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Oh no !

San Pedro ( people say it 's touristy/gringos/drugs " fooey ) is beautiful , the wi-fi is excellent , the food is so good , and everything is cheaper than Antigua too .

Get in touch if you need advice , we spent 2 months in Guatemala this time round , so are pretty up to speed ! <p> great post girls ! we both love antigua too . another great place to eat is toku , the falafel place . and we should definitely put in a plug for our friends at the black cat hostel ! even if you do n't  stay there , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night before kicking on later . love the photos too ! <p> Hi guys , first of all where is Toku ? !

Any other suggestions from you two Antigua experts are more than welcome ! <p> Hi Andi touristy it can be , but Semana Santa is madness !

Thanks for reading ! <p> Norbert , you have to go ! ! Guatemala is such a beautiful country , its one of our favorites . We only left last month , but were missing it already = Not just Antigua , but also Lake Atitlan , the volcanoes , the friendly Maya people ( However , Nicaragua is treating us very well , too ! ! ) Look out for our 33 things we love about Guatemala this week , itll make you want to go even more = <p> Antigua is a wonderful place to settle for a while .

We always like to hear from people who love Antigua as much as we do . Casa Santo Domingo is a beautiful spot we visited it , but unfortunately we could n't afford to stay there .

Hope all is well in Antigua ! ! <p> The unnamed bakery with the fabulous cakes ( my fave is the chocolate cream cake ) is called La Cenicienta . Another fantastic report -thank you . There are a lot of apartment opps in Antigua , so you 'll find something . This post is super helpful ! <p> Hi Clark Yellow House is good , clean , relatively cheap and comfortable . There is an unintended extra layer of security in that its tucked behind a travel agency , so the kids would have to actually get through the travel agency before escaping out onto the street ! = The thing is , there are no big rooms with three beds , for example . You could either see if you can rent out the entire dorm ( its only four beds ) or upstairs the corner room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace where you could have more space . However , there is a mixed crowd of guests which on a few nights included some drinking and hanging out ( but not always , much of the time it was very adult and peaceful and there is a curfew out on the top patio . ) Other hotels with big green areas will cost much more , though , so its a tough call . Showers are downstairs and shared but super cleanwhy do n't  you write them email protected they speak English and are very accommodating ! <p> Great posts about Anitgua . I understand the love affair with this beautiful town as I 've visited it off and on since the mid 70s . I 'm coming to Guatemala this November and am thinking of staying at the Yellow House . I " m 62travelling solo . Do you think this would be a fit ? Also I 'm hoping to travel to the Ixil Triangle ; an area Ive yet to explore . Any information about this part of Guatemala would be greatly appreciated . <p> Hi Nancy we stayed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good mix of all ages there . I think youd definitely meet some travelers at your age there , but also younger ones . The Yellow House was definitely NOT one of the party hostels = We have n't been to the Ixil Triangle yet , only passed through there on the way to Todos Santos , but I think our friends over at http : //trans-americas.com have been there and covered it on their site . Enjoy your visit in November ! <p> Hey , I love your posts I have been freaking out over all the negative sights and wondering if you feel like it is a safe place to visit with my daughter who is 20 . We have an apt four blocks from main square . I am paranoid about the buses from point a to b keep reading about robberies , kidnapping and rapes . I have travelled alone to India and around the world . Just with my daughter makes me worry . I am sounding like a big fat chicken , I think I might be . <p> Hi Margery , I totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your daughter with you . Antigua has become less safe than when I first moved there 12 years ago . That is true . However , within Antigua itself , being out during the day or eating at gringo-friendly restaurants , you 'll be fine . It really still has that quaint colonial feel , and its relatively small at 8+8 blocks ( that you 'll ever really visit ) . About buses , you have two different ways to get around you can take chicken buses or gringo shuttles . The gringo shuttles are faster , much more comfortable and more convenient . However , you are also recognizably in a gringomobile . The chicken buses , on the other hand , are very crowded and when you get on , it can look like it is physically impossible to squeeze through anyone or find anywhere to sit . There is a magic potion they take ( this part is not true ) that allows them to somehow squeeze through everyone . Here , you might be the target of theft for the most part , and usually a bag slash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gringo routes Antigua to Xela Antigua to Guatemala City , there have been reports of more serious crime . All I can say is that you should do what you are comfortable with we did both gringo shuttles and chicken buses , and the chicken buses were an adventure , but the shuttles made life a lot easierAlso , you can take a cab from the airport in Guatemala City straight to Antigua and then you avoid buses completely for that part . Just make sure it is an official taxi and the rate is worked out beforehand . I really hope this helps , and please let us know how you liked Antigua ( because you really should go = ) <p> I have spent a lot of time in Antiguaeven had an apartment there a few years ago . I like this town , lots of conveniences and things to do and see . The problem is that you can not go out at night and I do n't  care what anyone else says.its not safe . Lots of incidents are not for public knowledge but those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourism ! ! ! Be careful there is all I am saying . <p> By cruise ship , wow ! Which port does it dock at that they offer a day trip to Antigua ? I am curious = I 'd say just wander Antigua is so compact and with its grid layout , you cant get lost . Go see some of the ruins ( Santo Domingo , Convento La Recoleccion ) , make your way up to Cerro de la Cruz , a viewpoint with nice views over the city and the volcanoes ( find out what time the guided walks with the tourist police are , its safer that way ) . Take some time to eat or have coffee in one of the beautifully restored courtyards ( Cafe Condesa , Tretto or Las Antorchas for example ) .. visit La Merced , take some time to take in life at the Parque Central , pick up a map and visit some of the churches , which are beautiful . There 's also an artisan market ( corner of 2nda Avenida Norte and 2nda Calle Oriente , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block west of it ) where you can buy some handicrafts , art , fabric , etc , if you want to pick up some souvenirs . I would check Tripadvisor for a nice restaurant there are so many now , and so many new ones = Enjoy this wonderful town , George ! <p> Also a former local , I know the pain and pleasure one experiences to come back and see the changes in the city . Its hard to see a place you once called home change without you there but its also inspiring to watch the city grow and evolve and see other newbies fall in love with their own version of Antigua . Its been over two years since I moved away but I go back every few months ! My husband and I ( he s Guatemalan ) were so inspired on our last trip that we have decided to create a blog that focuses solely on the positive promotion of Guatemala so that others can the beauty of this place and its people . <p> Chelsea I am dying to go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into my travel plans = Now I have to head over to your site because I love that you say you want to share Guatemalas beauty always happy when people are spreading the word because Guatemala is such a special place for me . <p> Great Post !

Stop and look around for just a minute and there is an ever-present feeling that some type of major event has just let out in one of the worlds busiest cities . <p> In fact , late one recent Sunday afternoon , we discovered that everyone in the city is either headed to or coming from one single location . That place is a bakery called La Pasteleria Ideal on Avenida 16 September . Like ants marching into their mothership , Mexicans from all walks of life pile in through the tall 19th century wooden doors : - young Goth teenagers with headphones , hats and chains , suburban housewives , overweight seniors , bodybuilders , police officers and skate punks , all with their mothers , invade this one single bakery and pour out again with millions of calories wrapped up to go . <p> In business since starting out as a bread bakery in the 1920s , La Ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric of Mexico City . Tables are stacked high with every possible combination of chocolate , custard , dulce de leche and dough formed into multi-tiered cakes , soft cookies , flaky pastries , donuts dripping in frosting . Hundreds of sugar addicts literally pile dozens upon dozens of sweets onto oversized silver trays in a way that would make an innocent bystander think the end of the world were near . <p> Dani was immediately in her element the minute we walked through the doors . She handed me our bag , the camera and floated off on Cloud 9 to explore her Mexican Mecca . Her last words , and knowing nod , allowed me reprieve . This was too much for me , an itching fear inside me growing at the thought of what this insulin-charged crowd would do if the donuts ran out . You would think the four security guards circling inside the store might calm me , or the fact that , even late on a Sunday afternoon , more than 20 staff members dressed in white and blue were still ushering out cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weaved my way out the door , I watched one of those employees get stopped with his cart in the middle of an aisle , and a seemingly docile mother of three clear an entire level of the cart onto her tray . <p> In the thirty minutes I waited outside for Dani , I watched as hundreds of people poured back out the doors , each with their beautifully wrapped packages . Those few people who purchased only a few items had them wrapped in thick paper , tied shut with a string . Most others , however , left weighted down by three or four large boxes , all tied together with heavy-duty twine . When Dani came out , I 've never seen her smile so wide . On our way back to our hotel with our La Ideal package , we were suddenly aware of just how many people , even several blocks from the bakery itself , were carrying their pastries , too . <p> Boarding our plane to Costa Rica early the next morning , I caught a glint of approval in the flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based on the pandemonium the day before , I thought shed try to buy one off us. - If you want to lock in on a true Mexico City tradition , head to one of the three La Ideal Pasteleria locations in the city . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Haha , yes it was pretty easy to put on a few kilos with bakeries like this = The first time we went to Mexico City I HAD TO go to a bakery every single day , this time I was able to restrain myself a bit better = <p> Sugar or no sugar looks heavenly . I have cravings for sugar and just by looking at it , I feel like having a few of those cakes . Any country that has a tradition of sweets , I will have a soft corner for it . <p> Aaaaaaa I cant believe there are so many different sweets here .

We have to make it happen at some point I will be in the crowd and Jess will be filming the madness = <p> If I lived in Ciudad de Mexico , this place would be the death of me . We have such horrible bakeries in Florida , its easy to avoid them . There are even decent bakeries in Mega and Walmart stores in Mex . <p> If you cherish your life , MEVER , EVER go near La Ideal on january 6 ( or even a couple days before that ) , thousands of people buy their rosca de reyes there , the one time I went with a friend I spent the whole time waiting for her with my back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK , excellent pastries , mmm maybe not go around Halloween-dia de muertos , it might be the same . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142961 @2542961/ <h> Polaroid of the week : Street art in Cali , Colombia <p> The place I was most excited to visit in Colombia after Las Lajas sanctuary was Cali , Colombias third largest city and the salsa capital of the world . Last year , when I traveled through Colombia for nine weeks , I always saw myself stopping in Cali for a week or two to take salsa lessons its almost a compulsory ritual for solo female travelers in Colombia it seems . You go to Cali and learn how to salsa . But then I flew to Mexico on a whim and never made it to Cali . <p> My excitement about visiting Cali faded quickly , however , when I read the following section in Wikitravels Stay Safe section : <p> 2016 : Drive by robberies are frequent . A group of two or three motorcycles will pick a random passerby and surround her , pointing a gun at her and quickly emptying her pockets . The whole thing takes less than a minute . Apart from taking a taxi everywhere , there 's not much you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even in " safe " neighborhoods too . Apart from common sense ( which will minimize but *NOT* eliminate the risk of being robbed ) , empty your wallet of any unnecessary debit/credit cards , carry a photocopy of your passport instead of the original ( If you have an I 'd card that can be easily replaced , its even better ) , do n't  carry a lot of money . If you have an expensive phone , you might want to carry a cheap phone while in Cali . You could wear pants with hidden pockets , because the objective of this crime is to make a quick getaway , not to take a lot of stuff . That said , realize most tourists in Cali do n't  get robbed . <p> Yikes . <p> I was a bit freaked out , to be honest , and even cut my trip short , instead adding another stop to my tour of southern Colombia . I 'd stop not only in Popayan but also in the small town of Pasto . <p> By the time I finally got to Cali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city being a dangerous , gang-infested place where I 'd get robbed for sure . Instead , I found a city I instantly liked , and which I did n't  find scary at all . <p> I went for runs along the beautiful river walk , I wandered around the downtown area , climbed to the top of Acueducto Park Hill for lovely views over Cali , I enjoyed strolls through Simon Bolivar Park while munching on fresh pineapple ( for $0.17 a piece I developed an addiction quickly ! ) , and I admired the colonial buildings as well as the awesome street art in the San Antonio neighborhood . <p> Speaking of street art somehow nobody ever talks about Calis awesome street art scene . I 've read several articles and blog posts on Cali that talked about the citys churches and a cat sculpture park and salsa bars and museums , but no mention of the street art . <p> Hence I was surprised by the amount of street art I saw all over town but what a pleasant surprise !

@@107142962 @2542962/ <h> Where to stay in Negombo , Sri Lanka : The Reefs Edge Hotel <p> For my last couple of days in Sri Lanka , I had only one wish : relax and wind down , catch up on work , and be close to the airport . <p> The closest town to the airport is Negombo , a small fishing town known for its long sandy beaches and fish market . <p> While I was researching possible hotels to stay at I was told about the Reefs Edge Hotel , and while it was not exactly in Negombo ( its about 20 minutes south of town ) , after a quick look at the website , I was sold . I was n't looking to be in the center of the party anyway , but I was looking to chill out after a hectic three-week tour traversing Sri Lanka from Yala in the southeast to Jaffna in the far northwest , and everywhere in between.My pickup from the train station went smooth , and the typical Sri Lankan welcoming with cool towels and a refreshing drink in the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traveling . Checking in was quick and efficient ( you might take this for granted but in some other hotels I stayed at it took over 20 minutes to get checked in ! ) . The room was bigger than expected , and I loved the open air style bathtub in the open bathroom . No worries : there are blinds that can be lowered to induce a wall between bathroom and bedroom , but even when it is not lowered , toilet and shower are separately closed off from the main bathroom by glass doors . <p> All 23 rooms in the 2-storey hotel have an ocean view , a balcony , a desk ( which got a lot of use in the evenings and during the late afternoon monsoon rain showers ) , tea and coffee making facilities and big bathroom with a glorious , spacious rain shower.While the rooms are perfectly fine , the Reefs Edge Hotel is designed in a way that makes you want to be outside all the time instead of inside the room . <p> Just off the golden sand beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs are spread out in front of the stunning infinity pool . Looking out onto the ocean from the pool was one of the most calming things I did during my entire time in Sri Lanka ! On the opposite side of the grassy area , a two-level terrace leads into the restaurant and bar , both of which have top to bottom glass windows that boast the postcard-worthy views of palm trees , beach and the Indian Ocean . <p> The two-tiered terrace has a number of tables for outdoor dining on the upper level , and while there are some tables on the lower level as well , it is the comfy nests that catch your eye here . Filled with cushions , and a little roof to protect you from the sun , they are the perfect place to lounge in . I had my morning coffee here one day and it felt as if I was still in bed , only that I was enjoying the ocean breeze and the sound of the clashing waves.There are a couple more of these nests down on the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't swim in the ocean itself . As the name implies , the hotel sits right on the edge of a reef , and the current here is crazy , due to the height of the reef that drops extremely steep into the water . While some people might be disappointed about not being able to dip into the ocean , I did n't  mind it at all , thanks to the wonderful infinity pool . <p> The beach does invite to take long walks , however : a long and wide deserted , palm-fringed golden sand beach that goes on for miles . If you walk south , you 'll have the Colombo skyline and harbor in your view the entire time , if you walk north , you 'll pass a few lone fishermen , but that 's about it . It feels like you have this beach all to yourself . <p> The walks are needed to make up for the generous servings of food that are included in the full board price , including a buffet breakfast , lunch and dinner which both come with appetizer , soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really appreciated the fact that the hotel has a gym , equipped with a stepper , treadmill , bicycles , weights and some other toning equipment . I found the gym to be quite spacious in relation to the hotels size , which is something you do n't  often get most hotels that claim to have a gym only have a treadmill and some weights . Not so the Reefs Edge Hotel where I was able to fit in a full daily workout . <p> If you feel less active , you can just work your way through the comprehensive drinks menu at the bar , which I thought was very reasonable priced , especially compared to some of the ridiculously overpriced drink menus I 'd seen in other hotels of the same standard . If you feel like getting pampered , also no problem : the hotel has a large beautiful spa where you can get any treatment you desire , or let the certified massage therapists work their magic to make sure you leave the hotel 100% relaxed.Breakfast seemed to cater to British guests ( bacon , eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was pleased to see that local breakfast ( string hoppers , dhal curry , potato curry , coconut sambal and meat ) was available as well . In addition , there are fresh fruit and yogurt , breads , croissants and sweet pastries.Lunch and dinner both have several items to choose from for each course and I left the restaurant stuffed each time . <p> The staff was always helpful and attentive , everyone was doing their best to please the guests , although I found the language barrier difficult and the service slow at times . The pool attendant was the sweetest of them all , always making sure that my towels were tucked into the sun chair really well , and offering to take some photos of me inside the pool . <h> Stand-out features <p> For me , the absolute standout feature at the Edge Reef Hotel is the beautifully landscaped outside area that makes you want to do nothing but lounge , sunbathe and relax . As drinks were served right to the sunbed by the pool , I had no desire to even leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relax and indulge in fruit plates all day long . <p> The thoughtful equipment of the rooms is another aspect that stood out : there are monsoon rains in Sri Lanka ( mainly May to September in this part of the island ) , which does n't  mean that it rains all day , but it will rain for a couple of hours . For these hours , the Reefs Edge makes sure you wo n't get bored in your room : you can rent DVDs ( a massive movie selection ! ) or you can take a bath in the elegant stand-alone bathtub , or just sit at the desk and upload your vacation photos to Facebook or do it the old-fashioned way and write postcards to your loved ones . <h> Room for improvement <p> As mentioned above , I found the service to be lacking that extra bit of knowledge that you would expect in a hotel of this class , but considering that the hotel had only been open for eight months at the time of my visit and was just about to go in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get better over time . <p> The other aspect I found left to be desired was the food . While I always left the restaurant with a full belly , I never returned to my room thinking this was an amazing dinner . In fact , the vegetarian rice and curry dish was probably the one I liked the least in all of my time in Sri Lanka . The hot breakfast dishes were lukewarm , the pastries often did n't  seem fresh ( defrosted ? ) , and vegetarian dishes were not clearly marked I ended up with fish in my chickpeas , which is horrifying for any vegetarian . Vegetarian dishes should be marked as such , and the quality of the breakfast buffet could use an upgrade to become top-notch . <h> Overall <p> In my opinion , the Reefs Edge hotel is the perfect place to end a tour of Sri Lanka . It has everything you need to relax a spa , a terrific infinity pool , a bar and restaurant with fair prices , an exquisite spa and staff that make you feel welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the property ( which you probably wont ! ) , the hotel can arrange excursions to nearby attractions for you , such as the famous Negombo fish market or the nearby Muthujawarela Wetlands , for which I left my comfy spot by the pool one day , and while I was n't sure if it would be worth it , the amount of wildlife I saw on this cruise through the backwaters , canals and the Negombo lagoon , including kingfisher birds , water monitors and herons . As a wildlife lover , this was a fantastic way to end my time in Sri Lanka . The proximity to both Colombo and Negombo is also unbeatable , as is the short distance to the airport ( less than 30 mins away ) . 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Yes , I was at the airport within twenty minutes ! Was able to lounge by the pool all day , have dinner and one last Sri Lankan Lion beer and then my airport transfer was ready to go . It was perfect ! = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142963 @2542963/ <h> Tarsiers and chocolate hills in Bohol The Philippines <p> I went to Bohol for precisely one reason . This:I mean .. Look at this little guy ! Can you see why ? They remind me of mini-gremlins , but apparently they inspired Stephen Spielberg to make E.T . look the way he looks . <p> It was a quick detour for me , because even though there are some beaches and smaller islands like Panglao Island around Bohol , the main attractions are the tarsiers and the Chocolate Hills . The beaches seem nice but I did n't  meet anyone who was raving about them , which is why I saved my beach time for Siquijor , my next stop.Bohol is the 10th largest islands in the Philippines , and despite the beaches , beautiful scenery and tarsiers ( ! ) , it is somehow not part of the main tourist circuit . For me , Bohol was the first island where I got to see what life in the Philippines is like not a party island that caters primarily to tourists , and my first Filipino city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely different world compared to Tagbilaran , the main city on Bohol ) . In addition to the tarsiers , I wanted to see the Chocolate Hills in Bohol , a bizarre and equally beautiful creation of nature . Ideally I wanted to join a tour to combine both , but the tours at the guesthouse I was staying at were 2,500 Pesos ( US$56 ) and included a bunch of stops that I did n't  care about . And so I decided to visit both on my own , which did n't  seem too hard according to the Lonely Planet : a jeepney to the tarsiers , and then a bus to the Chocolate Hills.I had just sat down in the jeepney ( the most common type of public transportation in the Philippines , basically a jeep with a longer back part in which two each other facing benches are placed , with room for 20 to 30 people ) when a guy walked up to me and asked You want to go to the tarsier sanctuary ? I 'll take you with my motorbike . 100 Pesos . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a guy , because I am pretty sure none of my male traveler friends would have thought about that offer twice . For me as a solo female traveler , I was too fearful to accept his offer and waited for the Jeepney to fill up instead ( they leave when they are full ) . Little did I know then that I 'd end up on the back of some guys motorcycle later that day anyway.The jeepney made the journey longer as people were hopping on and off the vehicle every few minutes , but 45 minutes later I finally walked through the gates of the Philippine tarsier sanctuary , located in a jungle near the town of Corella . Tarsiers are some of the worlds smallest primates and can only be found in four island states : Sumatra , Sulawesi , Borneo and the Philippines , Bohol in particular . <p> While there used to be hundreds of them fifty years ago and before that , there are only very few left these days , because of deforestation and the resulting loss of their habitat . In Bohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see some of these incredibly cute animals.I learned that they are nocturnal animals , so they 're not really waiting for visitors to come by , instead you 'll see them snooze high above you in the trees . Well , you would n't even see them , that 's how tiny they are , but there is a guide who takes you on a short walk through the forest and shows you where they hang out . Two little guys were sitting on branches low enough for me to have a close-up encounter , and when he looked at me with these big round eyes I had a hard time not to squeal with joy and excitement . All I could think was : how do I get him out of here without anyone noticing ? ! Sadly the guide who had showed me some of the resident tarsiers in the forest made sure that only what entered the forest got out of there . But jokes aside , as much as I 'd like to cuddle a tarsier and have one as a mascot , tarsiers do n't  do well in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( usually by banging their head against the cage ) . <p> I also learned that their eyes are the largest in relation to their body of any mammal , and their eyes are even heavier than their brains . Another fun fact : tarsiers can climb a tree within only one day of being born ! Overall , the experience was pretty rushed , my visit lasted maybe 15 minutes . I was the only one , and I felt like the guide wanted to rush me out so that he could go for lunch , or maybe he just did n't  think someone could want to stare at the tarsier for an hour or longer . Do n't get me wrong " I still think it was worth making the trip out there , it just felt a bit anticlimactic after building up so much excitement about finally meeting a tarsier beforehand . <p> So I hopped on a jeepney back to Tagbilaran and took a bus to Carmen from the terminal to see the Chocolate Hills . It would be a long drive 2.5 hours according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ podcast . The ride turned out to be more enjoyable than expected I loved the lush green scenery we passed through , the rain forests , rice fields and the little villages where people were going about their day ( which means wandering around with their cows or goats ) . The ride was also shorter than expected : 90 minutes after boarding the bus I was told to get off by the conductor . I had already seen the first hills from the bus and could n't help but giggle about their shape . All my lesbian mind could see was a sea of boobs ( apologies for my adolescent behavior ; - ) ) . As soon as I got off the bus I was approached by a guy who offered ATV and motorbike tours through the hills . It was n't like I had much of a choice : the hills are spread out over a large terrain and unless I wanted to set off on a random hike across the fields , I would have to choose either one . The only other option I had was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill to enjoy the views over the hills , but I had n't  just spent 90 minutes on a bus to only get some views . I wanted to get right inside boobie chocolate hill country , and the guy had mentioned a climb up one of the hills . <p> Someone had fun with her new selfie stick ! <p> Not even three minutes after getting off the bus I was on the back of some random guys motorcycle and off we went . The thought that nobody even knew where I was that day crossed my mind briefly when we sped down the dirt road towards the hills , but no risk , no fun , right ? I relaxed a little more when we passed two other motorcycles , each with a young blonde in the back , and when I climbed up the steep slopes of a chocolate hill I was glad I had decided to pay for the guide ( 300 Pesos / US$6.75 ) these views alone were totally worth it , and it was just the beginning of the private tour . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eventually we went to the main Chocolate Hills viewpoint , which was packed with tour groups " apparently late afternoon was a good time to visit because of the good light conditions at that time of day.In total , there are over 1,300 of these hills spread out over 50sq km ( 20 sq miles ) , making the landscape look as if a giant mole has wreaked havoc here . While the 100 to 165 feet ( 30 and 50 meters ) high hills were bright green during my visit in February , they look brown when the grass dries up during dry season , hence the name.There is no clear scientific explanation on how these hills were created which is why there are a number of folk tales explaining how these oddly shaped cones came about : The first one says that two giants who did n't like each other threw stone and rocks at each other until they made up after a few days , leaving behind a big mess . The second story says that a giant was desperately in love with a mortal girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears into hills to show his eternal love . The third story is about a giant buffalo who ate all the crops in the area , and the farmers decided to leave out spoiled food for him to eat and get sick . And sick he got " leaving behind a trail of feces which turned into the Chocolate Hills when they dried.No matter which story is true , I loved what Mother Nature did there , and the hundreds of hills scattered across the otherwise flat landscape were a spectacular sight . <p> On my way back to Tigbalaran I did the math and calculated how much I spent on my day instead of the 2,500PHP tour : <p> Tricycle to the bus terminal : PHP30 / US$0.68 <p> Jeepney to the tarsier sanctuary : PHP20 / US$0.45 <p> Admission : PHP50 / US$1.13 <p> Jeepney back to Tagbilaran : PHP20 / US$0.45 <p> Bus to Carmen : PHP55 / US$1.24 <p> Motorcycle ride : PHP300 / US$6.75 <p> Admission to viewpoint : PHP50 / US$1.13 <p> Bus back to Tigbalaran : PHP55 / US$1.24 <p> Total : PHP580 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nisas Travelers in Tigbalaran , single rooms ( shared bathroom , fan ) are PHP500 ( US$11.30 ) , Wi-Fi and breakfast included . I would n't stick around Tigbalaran if you 're planning to go to Panglao Island or visit a beach on Bohol . If you only come here for the Chocolate Hills and tarsiers though Tagbilaran is a convenient base . <p> Do n't visit the Tarsier Sanctuary in Loboc , even though it is conveniently located on the road from Tagbilaran to the Chocolate Hills . Here , the tarsiers are kept in insufficient conditions and die from stress , poor care , and noise from the tour groups who stop here . The tarsiers are regularly replaced with illegally captured ones , posing another thread on the already declining tarsier population . Go to the one in Corella instead , about 20 minutes outside of Tagbilaran . <p> You can rent motorbikes in Tagbilaran and explore the island by yourself which is the cheapest option . Nisas can arrange motorbike rentals and I assume other guesthouses offer the same service . <p> If you go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hop onto a strangers motorbike , you can walk to the main viewpoint which is close to the main road . The walk takes about 20 minutes .. and includes 214 steps . Bring water ! <p> I flew from Boracay to Cebu to get to Bohol . From Cebu Airport , I took a cab straight to the ferry port and after two hours on a comfortable ferry , I arrived in Tagbilaran , the main city on Bohol . There is an airport in Tagbilaran with direct flights from Manila , but most people arrive by ferry . <p> Which one do you like better , the tarsiers or the Chocolate Hills ? 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 10 Comments <p> Really useful tips once again ! I 'm on Alona Beach right now and trying to figure out the best way to see the hills and tarsiers . I think I might stay in Tagbilaran one night and try to replicate your tour ! Wish me luck ! = <p> Yes , you 're a star ! Your tips on Asia are so helpful ! Ive been to Bohol/Panglao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and heading north to Panay and then Palawan next . Ill be totally honest Im having some struggles with the Philippines . I do n't  think its that solo backpacker friendly and I find it frustrating trying to get around . I 'm also about to lose it over the terrible internet . I 've seriously tried uploading the same video 15 times now ! But then every few days I do something so incredible , or have an amazing experience where local people are really generous and then I fall in love with it all over again ! <p> Oh I hear you on the internet ! ! That was my biggest issue with the Philippines ( other than the food ) and I do n't  want to discourage you but .. Palawan was the worst with internet . I did n't  even have 3G on my phone in El Nido , headed up there not knowing the internet would be terrible there .. almost impossible to book onward transportation or anything from there , and my emails would never load . That 's where I almost lost it = On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldve gone from El Nido to Coron . <p> Yeah , I heard El Nido is especially bad . I think I need to do some work in advance and then just try to enjoy the remoteness . Ill be heading to Coron too because I 'm a dive addict . Ill try to keep my cool ! = <p> Hi Rose , the trip to the tarsier sanctuary took about 45 minutes , but my visit was short .. maybe 15 mins . From there I had to return to Tigbalaran and take a bus to the Chocolate Hills , which took about 2 hours . I spent about an hour exploring the Hills I 'd say that everything together took me nearly all day . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142964 @2542964/ <h> Life lately and upcoming travels : February 2015 Edition <p> In my monthly round-ups , I am looking back at my travels over the past four weeks , what went well and what did n't  , what 's new with Globetrottergirls.com , what 's next for me and the most popular posts of the last month . <h> Where I 've been <p> I spent February in the Philippines and in Thailand , and with the exception of short city breaks in Manila , Bangkok and Chiang Mai , I 've been island hopping pretty much the entire time ! <p> I promised myself that I 'd slow down after my hectic **26;178;TOOLONG January and that 's exactly what I did . Still , when I count all the places I visited this month , it seems I got around quite a bit : Boracay , Siquijor , Apo Island , Palawan , Manila , Bangkok , Koh Tao , Koh Phangan , Chiang Mai.On one hand , I was n't ready to leave the Philippines at all , on the other hand I was so ready to leave . This trip to the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me ( I 'll touch more on that in What went wrong ) , and I found myself wishing I could just travel without any work commitments several times during my time there , since sticking to work commitments turned out way more difficult than expected due to the terrible internet connection on most of the islands I visited . <p> The responsible part of me was dying to get to a country with better WiFi , the other part of me was longing to see more of this beautiful island nation . The Philippines are an absolute paradise and I was dying to see more . When I boarded my plane to Bangkok , I did n't  say Goodbye to the Philippines , I said See you soon , and I mean it . ( Next time I make sure I do n't  have any urgent deadlines though ) . <p> The Philippines <p> Arriving in Bangkok felt like coming home , and even though I still do n't  love the city , I can appreciate it for the many good food options and some big city amenities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in my heart I am a city girl , and I could n't wait to indulge in some yummy Thai food ( the Philippines are not very vegetarian-friendly ) and good coffee ( which is surprisingly hard to come by in most places in the Philippines , but then again I was hanging out on tropical islands most of the time where people do n't  really care about their caffeine fix . Manila of course has great coffee ) , go see a movie and shop for some gadgets at MBK . <p> This might have been the real reason why I was looking forward to Bangkok so much ? <p> After a couple of days of getting my city fix I was ready for some beach time again and I already mentioned that I 'd be showing several people around South East Asia this winter , so I was ecstatic to start in Thailand ( the next visitor is already waiting for me in Bali ) , and combine island hopping with temple hopping . <p> I finally visited Koh Tao , an island that I 'd been wanting to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gulf of Thailand seems to fall hard for it . And would be lying if I said I was n't tempted to just stay there for a couple of months and enjoy the laid-back island life instead of moving on to Koh Phangan and Chiang Mai . <p> Koh Tao <h> What went well <p> Manila I have to mention Manila here because I thought I 'd hate the city , based on the stories I had heard from other people . I love it when a city surprises me and Manila did exactly that I had a great time there ! <p> The Philippines in general I had seen the photos of the glorious islands in the Philippines , so I knew that I was in for a treat , but I just did n't  expect to like the country as much as I did . And I am saying this in spite of lack of good coffee , food and WiFi , the only three things I need to be fully content , so you know this must mean something ! I am already planning my next trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Philippines ? <p> Meeting new people If you 're subscribed to my newsletter , you already know that my first solo trip went exceptionally well and that I never had the chance to feel lonely in fact , I had to escape people sometimes because I am easily distractible , meaning if I 'm hanging out with other travelers and they 're going out while I have to stay in to work , FOMO kicks in and I might neglect my work commitments in favor of a fun night out . <h> What went wrong <p> Lack of wifi Like I said , the WiFi is something that is left to be desired in the Philippines and while I knew that it would be slow , I just did n't  expect it to be that slow . I hard a hard time posting articles because I could barely upload photos , and it took forever for my emails to load every time I connected to the internet . <p> I ended up being unreliable towards clients , missing out on some opportunities because my inbox was overflowing and I consequently did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had several meltdowns because of the WiFi in the Philippines , especially in my last week in El Nido where not even the 3G on my phone worked , and so I was almost completely offline during my stay there . <p> When I finally arrived in Bangkok and discovered that the WiFi in my hotel room was n't working , I burst into tears because I had been waiting for high speed internet for weeks . Luckily the WiFi situation improved considerably after that incident . <p> How a tiny island in the Gulf of Thailand can have faster WiFi than the entire Philippines is beyond me . <p> Planning fail in the Philippines I had many more destinations on my Places I Have To See list for the Philippines , but I learned the hard way that you actually have to plan in advance there . While I prefer getting to a place , see if I like it , and then decide when I 'd like to move on to the next place , this is often not possible in the Philippines because you have to take flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at finding cheap flights , booking a flight a couple of days in advance will cost you , even in the Philippines where you have several budget airlines . Some flights ended up being just too pricey , forcing me to stay longer in some places and having to skip some destinations completely , but on the upside : I now have am excuse to return to the Philippines and I ended up making a detour to some places I might have skipped but ended up loving , like Apo Island ( see pictures below ) . Injuries I severely burned myself on my first snorkeling trip in the Philippines . I thought I was being super careful applying sun protection over and over again , but apparently I missed some spots above and below my butt every time . 13-hour transportation days with a burned butt are no fun . <p> On another snorkeling trip I cut my foot on some coral which caused me to limp for several days . I was lucky both time that it was n't worse and I did n't  need to see a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apo Island had to be flown to a hospital because he stepped into a sea urchin ) , but traveling with injuries is something I can do without . <p> Breakdown at the ATM In Siquijor , I had a great day touring the island with a local and asked him if we could stop at an ATM somewhere along the way . I had seen several ATMs but learned then that they do n't  accept foreign cards the only one that worked for foreigners was a one-hour detour away . When I finally got there , I let a British girl skip the line and get in front of me that girl ended up being the last one to get money . After that , the ATM was out of service . A bank clerk told us to wait , and I had no other chance because I wanted to leave the island the next morning and needed money for my guesthouse and for the ferry . Two hours later , I was still in line . The bank had tried to reboot the machine several times , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think that I might not get any cash out and felt absolutely helpless . I was just about to freak out when the ATM magically came back to life . <p> Side note : Reading through this , I just noticed that quite a few things went wrong this month .

I felt the exact same way . It might be one of the more frustrating countries but it still managed to win me over ! I did n't  realize you were going to Indonesia . Where are you planning on visiting ? <p> Justine that 's what I thought about the Philippines .. why did I like it so much even though it was quite challenging to travel there ? ! Filipino magic I suppose = As for Indonesia I did n't  realize I was going until last week ! I was n't sure if my friend who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out she is really there ! Since its such a spontaneous visit I do n't  have many plans yet but the Gilis look interesting , Nusa Lembongan ( thanks to your post ! ) and Lombok are all on my wishlist . Sadly I do n't  have a lot of time for my first visit to Indonesia because another visitor is coming to Thailand at the end of March . If you have any recommendations for must-do / must-see places , please let me know = <p> I visited the Philippines on my own in 2009 and loved it too , though at that time I was an omnivore ( the food still did n't  impress me , though ) and wasnt relying on good wifi , so those things did n't  bother me so much . I just loved how friendly the people were , and how amazing the beaches are ! I 'm hoping to go back with Zab at some point , too . <p> Well I think everyone who visits the Philippines agrees on the fact that their food is nothing to write home about = Wi-Fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which is surprising because the Philippines are so much more advanced than Bolivia . Oh well . I hope you 'll get to take Zab there one day ! <p> Dani Love your photos . Thailand has a special place in my heart . I spent 2 months over there including koh Tao and agree with you I could easily have stayed there for long than I did . I look forward to visit the Philippines when I get back on the road = Thank you for sharing . <p> The ATM story is actually worse than it sounded because that all happened on a Friday afternoon , the bank was about to close and the clerks who were trying to reconnect the ATM were about to leave for the weekend . I do n't  know what I wouldve done had it not started working again ! <p> I 'm so excited you are going to Indonesia ! ! I was born there and I 'm sure we can wow you just as much as Thailand and the Philippines did ! I cant wait to read more about it and to see those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to ? I know places in Surabaya and Jakarta , but nothing else . Other than speaking the language fluently &amp; have undying confidence that we really do have the best food , I really do n't  know much else . I moved here when I was in middle school and I never used the time to explore more of the country . Its something I 'd like to change when I plan to go home later this year . All that is to say : I 'll be joining you in learning more about Indonesias cultures and foods . <p> Good to know about planning ahead for flights in the Philippines . I want to spend about a month there and already pretty much know where I want to go so will book the flights between islands before I get there . Was it easy to get around islands once you were there ( buses ? ) ? <p> Definitely book your flights ! ! I couldve saved so much money had I been smarter in that respect . Cebu usually sucked ( delays &amp; cancellations ) but sometimes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AirAsia and PAL Express . Getting around on the islands was very easy ( and cheap ! ) There are either inexpensive tourist shuttle vans or local buses . <p> Whilst I 've been to Bangkok a couple of times I 'd struggle to say that Ive been anywhere else on your February list . <p> Sorry to hear about the sunburn . I often come across the same problem that sun is so unforgiving . <p> As for the lack of Wifi I feel your pain . It is amazing how we 've all become so online dependent nowadays . Even just a few years ago we were a little more tolerant of poor wifi service . Yet now places are really advancing . So much so that poor internet connections almost anywhere is really not acceptable . <p> As for ATMs not accepting foreign cards , that is very tourist unfriendly . It sounds like these banks need to improve their systems . <p> As for the wifi that 's why I wish I did n't  have to rely on making money while I travel . Everybody else in the Philippines was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was n't able to reply to important emails and fulfill work commitments which sucked big time . As for the ATMs yes tourist-unfriendly for sure but I 've been to quite a few places like that . I have to say though : Siquijor , not a huge tourist destination in the Philippines , at least had an ATM . El Nido in Palawan does NOT have an ATM ( the closest one is a 6-hour drive away ) and that 's one of the biggest tourist destinations in the country . = <p> It was a super rushed visit anyway , packed with touristy activities ( showing around a first-time visitor ) but I am sure that well bump into each other sooner than later ! Will you still be in Asia in the fall ? Tbex Bangkok ? = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

My three days in Cologne were definitely my favorite part of the week my last two days in Berlin and also in Dusseldorf , it was mostly about work , but I tried to take some time off this weekend to find out if I still loved Cologne as much as I did fifteen years ago . Cologne and I have a special history : I visited the city for the first time with my girlfriends when I was 15 and was instantly mesmerized by the multi-cultural , vibrant city . What a difference from my sleepy hometown it was ! I decided right there and then that I was going to move to Cologne one day , and a few more visits during my last couple of years in high school reaffirmed my love for the city , which is why I ended up enrolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to leave unexpectedly after only two years , but always thought I 'd come back one day possibly to live there . But life had other plans for me and I never returned until now , that is .

With a good friend in tow and perfect summer weather , I could n't have asked for a more perfect time here from food markets to bike rides along the Rhine River to a night out in Colognes thriving LGBT bar scene , I loved every second of it . <p> Being a sucker for love locks ( and maybe even having locked my very own one on a famous bridge ) one thing I was excited about was that I finally got to see one of the most famous love lock bridges in the world : the Hohenzollern Bridge .

Its absolutely insane ! Now that I 've become a little more jaded rational when it comes to everlasting love and love declarations , I could n't help but wonder how many of these couples were still together . There must be far more than 40,000 locks now apparently , the love locks weigh over 2 tons ! Let 's just hope they do n't  cause the bridge to collapse like the love locks at the Pont Des Arts in Paris , where the locks have been removed consequently . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

It was like the perfect summer fling ; an intense few days intense because you know it will come to an end soon and you want to savor every precious moment to the max.However , when I arrived in Tel Aviv , I did n't  think I would end up leaving this city with a heavy heart . I like pretty cities when a city is obviously beautiful like Antigua , Paris or Buenos Aires , I tend to fall in love quickly . With cities that are n't  as pretty at first sight , like Berlin or Bangkok , it usually takes me a while . Tel Aviv belonged to the second category , visually not particularly appealing at first , even feeling a little gritty in some parts.It took me a few days of wandering the streets , but then , completely unexpected , the city put a spell on me and grabbed me hard , pulled me into its fascinating mix of old-fashioned markets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish families and Arab Muslims ; a city with a delicious food scene , buzzing nightlife and gorgeous beaches right at your doorstep.Tel Aviv took hold of me and has n't  let me go since : while I travel to a lot of places that I 'd like to return to , I do n't  often travel to places I 'd like to live in . Tel Aviv is one such place though I would love to live there for a while , taking my time to truly explore the city , understand- its culture , its people and as a foodie : have enough time to delve into the cafe and restaurant scene , of which I only scratched the surface.I am not sure what exactly it was that made me fall for the city it might have been the beach , which is without a doubt part of the draw of Tel Aviv , nearly nine- miles ( 14km ) of wide sandy beaches right in the city center . There are just not that many cities in the world that have such a prime oceanfront location . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the promenade , or finish my day with a sunset run while the sun colored the sea and the sky with striking tones of orange , red and purple .

I would never get tired of it.The local runners- I passed on my runs usually looked as if they had fallen right out of a mens magazine , wearing nothing but shorts and showing off their perfect abs , covered in a layer of sweat . I would run by- the gay beach , where couples sat together all loved up , and of course I have to love a city that has its own gay beach ( even though I loved other parts , such as Gordon , Frishman or Banana Beach , just as much ) in the Middle East no less ! I loved the active vibe along the beaches no matter if it was running , cycling , inline skating , kite boarding or the popular matkot ball game , people were doing some kind of activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offset all the delicious food I stuffed myself with , but Tel Aviv just seems to be an active city and with a gorgeous backdrop like these beaches you do n't  need an excuse to go outside and exercise . <h> Tips for visiting Tel Aviv <p> The free walking tours- are a great way to help you get a good overview of the city ; there are several ones you can choose from .

This tour covers the- historical neighborhoods of Jaffa , the American-German colony , Neve Tzedek and the old railway station and covers the main parts of Tel Aviv perfect if you only have a day or two in the city . <p> If you love street art as much as I do , you should check out- Guy Sharetts Urban Culture tours .

On Wednesdays it is girls night at Tel Avivs iconic gay bar Shpagat . Tel Avivs longest standing LGBT bar Evita is also worth a visit . <p> In addition , there 's a number of lesbian parties at changing venues Facebook is the best way to find out what 's going on while you 're in town .

I felt Jerusalem had a more unique mix of modern day city architecture with old history ( i.e. the Old City ) . One can get that to some extent in Tel Aviv as well , especially in Jaffa , Neve Tsedek , etc . The Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem was stunning and seem to have more character &amp; variety than the markets in Tel Aviv . On the flip side , no beaches and sunset in the beach in Jerusalem . <p> Both the cities seemed pedestrian friendly to me . I used to walk to Jaffa from where I lived ( 1 km from Carmel market ) . In Jerusalem I had great walks from German Colony to the Old City . I also took the free walk tours in Jaffa , Old City in Jerusalem and some guided walk tours in Mt Olive , etc and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cafes in Tel Aviv , but both Tel Aviv &amp; Jerusalem had good breakfast/brunch places . Do you have any favourite hummus place in Tel Aviv and/or Jerusalem ? <p> Overall , I have been just blown away by Israel and cant wait to visit again . Next time I want to see the sunrise in Masada which I think you did during your trip ! Sorry for probably writing a bit off topic from Tel Aviv ; am just reliving my wonderful memories through your posts ! <p> Prasun , thanks so much for sharing your thoughts ! I felt like Jerusalem was much cleaner than Tel Aviv the market was a good example for that . But because they have such strict restrictions for the construction of new buildings , the modern architecture seemed much neater than in Tel Aviv . Also a good point about the number of cafes in Jerusalem vs . Tel Aviv . Totally agree ! Best hummus in Tel Aviv is definitely Ali Karavan , which I 'm sure you know since you lived in Jaffa = P.S. Yes I did see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absolutely stunning . <p> I know that hummus place which I think is also called Abu Hassan . It was too crowded all the time I was there ! Did you try or see the " Blackout Restaurant " in Jaffa : LONG ... I thought it was unique even though I did n't  dine there and one needs to book way ahead of time . A Georgian vegetarian/vegan eatery in Tel Aviv that I found interesting was Nanuchka ( http : //nanuchka-tlv.com/ ) . Thanks for sharing your Israel experience ! <p> I moved to Tel Aviv 2 weeks ago from Berlin . High rents , great food but everywhere I go where people live it smells of catshit . The locals do n't  notice but I do . 2nd , motorcycles on the sidewalks , I got hit pretty hard on my 3rd day , almost knocked me over . People call them electric bikes but that is a misnomer , that are electric motorcycles that go 40 to 50 kph on the sidewalks and are really quiet . The cops say nothing and on Tuesday I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lady on the motorcycle kept going . She may be old but that is someones Mama , sister , daughter . On the ground I noticed one leg was shorter then the other , a sign of a broken hip . She was in so much pain . It will take a baby to get killed to wake up the Police to the problem . Otherwise , Tel Aviv is a fine city overloaded with wild cats and mototcycles on the sidewalks . <p> How have you adjusted in the past few weeks , Moshe ? Have you grown to love Tel Aviv a bit more ? Its so different from Berlin , I guess it takes a while to adjust = But you 'll appreciate the warmer winters and having the beach right on your door step , no ? ? = <p> Tel Aviv has been on my travel list for years and now I definitely want to go soon ! I love your descriptions and your pictures , especially the cat . I always seem to take pictures of cats when I 'm traveling too = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142968 @2542968/ <h> Polaroid of the week : The awe-inspiring Jetavanaramaya Stupa in Anuradhapura , Sri Lanka <p> This past week was all about temple hopping , as my temporary fellow globetrottergirl Becki and I left the tea country and traveled north to Sri Lanka 's cultural triangle . We had already spent a couple of days there as part of our pre- TBC Asia conference trip , climbing up the lone 660 feet ( 200 meters ) tall rock of Sigiriya , on which the remnants of an ancient palace sit . This time , we would visit Polonnaruwa , the second royal capital of Sri Lanka , one thousand years old ; and Anuradhapura , which was the first religious and cultural capital of the Sinhalese , which held this title for 1,300 years . <p> Founded in the 4th century BC , it is one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world . While most of the ancient stupas and structures are not inhabited anymore , they have been preserved over the centuries , and until today Anuradhapura remains an important sacred place for Buddhists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , and hundreds of Buddhists make a pilgrimage to Anuradhapura every day . With an area of over sixteen square miles ( 40- km- ) , it is one of the biggest archeological sites in the world . <p> The sheer size of the city makes it almost impossible to explore it in one day , but we were lucky enough to find a tuktuk driver who knew his way around the most majestic and remarkable sights . Jetavanaramaya , pictured , was one of the most impressive structures , and is not only one of the tallest stupas in Sri Lanka but in the entire world ! In fact , the stupa is the 3rd largest structure in the ancient world " only the Great Pyramids of Giza are larger . 93.3 million baked bricks were used to build the 400 feet ( 120 meters ) high stupa , making it the largest brick building that was ever built . The engineering behind this construction is a miracle to me , especially when you take into consideration that it was erected between 276 and 303 BC ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ancient bathing pools , a mystic temple built into a rock and the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi Tree , or the Tree Of Life , which is the centerpiece around which Anuradhapura was built . It felt like we had planned our time in the cultural triangle the right way " starting with the small Sigiriya , followed by the more impressive ( at least to me ) Polonnaruwa , and culminating in the awe-inspiring Anuradhapura . All three sites were declared UNESCO World Heritage , a well-deserved honor . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Yes , there are plenty of plantations you can visit around Ella , Nuwara Eliya and Hatton . In any of these three places , just let your hotel or a local recommend a good tea plantation . I do n't  remember if it was in Ella or Nuwara Eliya in one of the two we just wandered outside of town , a beautiful walk right through the plantations . Oh and most offer tours and tastings = Enjoy tea country it is so gorgeous ! ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142969 @2542969/ <h> From Pucon to Ushuaia : Our route through Patagonia <p> South America is massive and we get a lot of practical travel questions about our trip across the continent . Patagonia is one of the most breathtaking places to visit in all of South America , but the huge distances , high prices and endless options make it hard to plan a trip . Dani put together our entire route from Chile 's Lake District down through Patagonia to Tierra Del Fuego , including buses , hotels , sightseeing options and destination options from each of our stops . - We took public buses all along , except for the ( unexpected ! ) hitchhiking adventure on Tierra Del Fuego . <p> You can find links to all the in-depth posts we wrote about each place and other relevant information below each place . <p> Let 's start with a map of our route : <h> Puc+n <p> Our first stop in the Lake District was Puc+n , a popular resort town at the foot of the Villarica volcano , the main attraction in the area . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from kayaking to volcano climbing and trekking . If you are not into any of these , we 'd recommend heading straight to Puerto Varas instead . <p> Where we stayed:We stayed at One Way Hostel ( which was very basic there are better options in Puc+n ) and paid CLP17,000 for a private room with shared bathroom . <p> We actually found Turbus the best bus company in Chile . Book tickets in advance for cheaper tickets than on travel day. - <p> Recommended number of days:2 to 3 days . Most people come here to climb Villarica volcano , but we would suggest at least another day for some rafting , kayaking or a visit to Huerquehe National Park . Also , if your heart is set on the volcano hike , plan in a extra days in case of bad weather . It rained here the entire three days of our visit and we could n't have climbed it unless we stayed at least another two , when the weather was supposedly going to clear up . <h> Puerto Varas <p> Puerto Varas is a small town on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German settlers who developed the area in the late 19th- century . From here you can take a day trip to Frutillar , an even more German village ( think wooden houses and lots of cake ) , or hike in the National Park with beautiful views of Volcano Osorno . You can take a bus to Bariloche ( in the Argentine Lake District ) straight from here . While we werent particularly lucky with the weather during our time in the Lake District , it still made it into our Top Five Places To Visit In Chile and should n't be missed on a trip to Patagonia ! Since it is relatively close to Bariloche , it is easy to incorporate it into your itinerary . <p> Where we stayed:We stayed at Margouya 2 in Puerto Varas , Chilewhich we really liked ! It was CLP20,000 for a double room with shared bathroom . Breakfast was included. - <p> How we got to Puerto Varas : We took a JAC bus from Puc+n to Puerto Montt ( five hours , CLP10,000 ) and changed into a mini-bus to Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are CLP800 and it takes about 20 minutes ) . <p> Note:If you are planning to head straight down to Puerto Natales ( Torres del Paine ) , you have to take a bus from Puerto Montt ( 15 min from Puerto Varas ) all the way south to Punta Arenas first ( 35 hours ) and then back up three hours to Puerto Natales . Check out timetables at Cruz Del Sur ( CLP42,000 ) . If you plan to skip Argentina ( see below ) then a flight would seriously cut down your travel time from Puerto Varas/Montt to Torres del Paine . Both Sky Airline and LAN offer flights on this route and have good prices if you book in advance . <p> Recommended number of days : 2 to 3 . You can trek to Osorno volcano , go on a rafting or kayaking trip , or go on a 1-day cycle trip along the lake to the quaint town of Frutillar ( 60km round-trip ) . You can also take a day trip to Chiloe from here , if you rent a car ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a detour to the island of Chiloe , located about two hours southwest of Puerto Varas . In hindsight , we should have rented a car in Puerto Varas to be more flexible on the island and returned it to Puerto Varas to take a bus to Bariloche ( Argentina ) from here . The detour was well worth it though and we discovered some of the most scenic regions of Chile . <p> Where we stayed:We stayed at Hotel Ancud Petit ( we shared a quadruple room at CLP10,000 per person ) and used Ancud as our base for exploring Chiloe . <p> How we got to Chiloe : We took a Cruz del Sur bus from Puerto Montt to Ancud ( CLP6,300 ) , which loads onto a ferry for the last 30 minutes you can get out and walk around . A car rental would have allowed us to see much more of the island , and we 'd recommend a two-day rental . <p> Recommended number of days:You can see a lot of Chiloe in a day trip from Puerto Varas if you rent a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that you are able to see the main towns on the island , visit Chiloe National Park and maybe take a tour to a penguin colony . <h> Bariloche <p> Bariloche is an easy 6-8 hour bus ride over the Andes depending how long the border crossing takes . It is possible to take buses from Puerto Varas , Puerto Montt and Osorno. - Bariloche is set in a stunning location on lake Nahuel Huapi and should definitely not be missed . There are plenty of hikes around the area , the nearby Nahuel Huapi National Park with its famous Black Glacier , and activities like kayaking on the lake or hiking up to the viewpoints around town . It reminded us very much of Colorado , in the US . <p> How we got to Bariloche : We took a bus ( Tas Choapa ) from Puerto Montt to Bariloche ( 6 hours ) and paid CLP14,000 per person . <p> Recommended number of days:Wed suggest at least 2 full days ( 3 would be even better ) in Bariloche to explore the town , head out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hike up to the viewpoints ( Cerro Otto or Campanario ) , take a boat ride out onto the lake to the islands or visit Nahuel Huapi National Park . <p> Tip:Make sure to exchange Chilean pesos for US Dollars before heading to Argentina . The Blue Dollar exchange rate that you get when changing US Dollars in cash for Argentine Pesos is almost twice as good as the official rate . We wrote about the Blue Dollar and travel costs in Argentina here . <h> El Chalten <p> Getting to El Chalten from Bariloche proved more difficult than expected . Luckily there is one bus operator , Taqsa , that offers the 27-hour ride straight down along mostly gravel road to El Chalten a few times a week during the summer months ( December to April ) . Taking the bus was much cheaper than taking a plane ( via Buenos Aires ) , and El Chalten was absolutely worth it . You can easily spend a week here hiking some of the numerous treks in the National Park or going ice trekking on Glacier Viedma . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hostel , which we did n't  like at all and would n't recommend . Rooms were overpriced , and there were no lockers in the dorms , which is n't great in a place where people are out hiking all day ( and the hostel was unlocked and unmanned at times ) . There are better hostels in El Chalten on Booking.com . For such a small town , - this is a major stop for hikers from around the world as well as Argentine backpackers , so- make sure to book early , since hostels fill up quickly in the high season ( December March ) . <p> How we got to El Chalten : We took the Taqsa Bus from Bariloche to El Chalten ( 27 hours , around ARS900 per person ) . Check their website for departure dates and times , since they do n't  go seven days a week . There is one other company , ChaltenTravel , that offers the ride , too , including the first night in El Chalten for free . However , we heard that the accommodation they provide is subpar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride . <p> Recommended number of days:There are so many hiking trails around El Chalten , you can easily spend 5 days hiking several trails . We spent only two full days here which was far from enough . Four five days would be ideal if you are into hiking at all . <h> El Calafate <p> It was easy to get from El Chalten to El Calafate , 220 km south of El Chalten , which was a scenic 3-hour bus ride on newly paved roads . We came solely to see Perito Moreno Glacier , which turned out to be one of our South America highlights . <p> How we got to El Calafate : We took a bus from El Chalten ( 3 hours , ARS150 per person ) there are several buses per day . <p> Recommended number of days:We spent two nights in El Calafate , and had half a day to explore town and book our tour to Perito Moreno Glacier , and spent the next day at the glacier . If you only want to visit the glacier from here , 2 nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day here exploring the Laguna Nimez wetlands sanctuary or the Glaciarium ( a high-tech glacier museum 6km out of town ) . <h> Puerto Natales <p> From El Calafate , we took a bus ( Cootra ) back across the Andes and the border to Puerto Natales in Chile to visit Torres Del Paine . The bus ride took around six hours , including the easy border crossing ( do n't  have any fresh fruit or vegetables with you on the bus , or declare it immediately if you do Chile is very strict about this to the tune of $250 dollar fines for an apple ) . <p> Had we known how far out of town the bus station in Puerto Natales would be , we probably would have booked a hostel in advance instead of shopping around ' for a nice place to stay when we got there . Puerto Natales turned out to be a pleasant little town with some fabulous restaurants , and we are glad that we went , even though we did n't hike the W Trek . <p> Where we stayed : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found walking around town looking at several options . We paid CLP15,000 for a double room with shared bathroom ( the cheapest option we found in Puerto Natales ) . <p> How we got to Puerto Natales : We took a bus from El Calafate with Cootra from El Calafate for ARS150 per person ( five hours ) . <p> Get to Ushuaia from Puerto Natales:If you do n't  want to visit Punta Arenas or Chilean Tierra del Fuego afterward , - you can go straight to Rio Gallegos from Puerto Natales ( 4.5 hours ) and catch a bus from here to Ushuaia ( another 12 hours ) . If you 're planning to do this trip in one go , its going to be a very long day . See direct connections from Punta Arenas to Ushuaia below . <p> Recommended number of days : - This depends on if you 're planning to hike the W-Trek . If so , you 'll need 4 nights in Torres Del Paine National Park , and we would recommend a night before ( to prepare for your trek and make final arrangements ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , take a hot shower , enjoy some good food ) in Puerto Natales . Keep in mind that the weather in Torres Del Paine is extremely unpredictable it can rain for days here and you might end up canceling your W-Trek and opt for one or two day trips into the park instead . <p> Tip : Our fellow blogger Arienwen wrote a great guide to the W-Trek , including a detailed break-down of each day , costs for food and accommodation along the way , equipment you need , and more ! <p> If you are not doing the W trek , you can spend a couple of days relaxing in Puerto Natales there is surprisingly good food catering to an international crowd and the waterfront is a nice way to watch the sunset at least once . <h> Punta Arenas <p> Our next stop was Punta Arenas , the southernmost city on mainland Chile . The city is well connected via bus and there are two bus companies that run several times a day from Puerto Natales to Punta Arenas and the other way around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and we enjoyed our time there . The feeling of how far south you have made it really hits home in this chilly , clean antarctic city . Accommodation was more expensive than expected in the hospedajes around town . The cheapest double room we could find was US$40 , and it was not nice . <p> Once you land here , it is essential to plan your further travels from here in advance since buses to Ushuaia only run on certain days . The ferry to Porvenir only leaves once a day , and sometimes it leaves in the morning others in the afternoon . <p> Our main reason to spend a few days here was the Magellan Penguin colony , but if you plan to visit them , you also need to plan your visit properly , as the tours out there only leave on some days of the week ( at least during low season ) , and we missed the one day when they went while we were in town . <p> The travel agency that offers tours to the penguins sits on the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit Hospedaje Magallanes which runs the Aeonikenk travel agency that offers several different day trips from Punta Arenas . Visiting the King Penguin colony in Tierra Del Fuego is about CLP55,000 per person , visiting the penguin colony at Seno Otway is CLP10,000 per person . Pali Aike ( Navarro 1125 ) was another travel agency we found that offers trips to the penguins . They offer private tours for CLP39,000 per couple ( not including CLP7,500 National Park entrance fee ) . <p> Where we stayed:We did n't  find anything online that sounded great , so we just showed up and looked for a place when we arrived . Most B&amp;Bs and guest houses started at CLP25,000 for a double room . We stayed Hostal Art Nouveau ( CLP35,000 for an ensuite double room incl. breakfast ) . <p> How we got to Punta Arenas : We took Buses Fernandez , for CLP5,000 per person . They have five or six buses daily from Puerto Natales to Punta Arenas . <p> How to get from Punta Arenas to Ushuaia:Bus-Sur ( CLP35,000 ) Taqsa and Tecni-Austral both have several buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedules ) that go directly from Punta Arenas to Ushuaia and vice versa.Recommended number of days:If you are planning to see the penguin colonies , plan at least two nights here . We did n't  book our penguin tour right on the first day and lost out on it because there werent any other tours while we were in town and we werent able to extend our stay . <h> Porvenir <p> We went to Porvenir to experience some of Chile 's part of Tierra Del Fuego , and because we thought we could hop on a more direct bus to Ushuaia from here . It was only when we arrived in Porvenir that we found out that there were no buses at all across Tierra del Fuego . Oops . Encouraged by our friendly hostel owner Vicente , we decided to hitchhike from Porvenir which luckily worked out . If you are not into bird watching ( the main draw for people to visit Tierra Del Fuego ) , you can easily skip Porvenir and head straight to Ushuaia from Punta Arenas ( see above ) . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for CLP5,500 per person . Check the ferry timetable beforehand though we were told that our ferry would leave at 9am , but when we got to the ferry terminal it turned out the ferry left 4pm on Thursdays . <p> Recommended number of days:Depends on what you are planning to do while you are here . We found two nights ( 1 full day ) to be enough , but we did n't  go on any bird watching trips / hikes . <h> Ushuaia <p> Ushuaia , officially the southernmost city of the world and the southernmost tip of South America , was our final stop . We made it here after hitchhiking from Porvenir to Rio Gallegos , where we caught a bus to Ushuaia . <p> Where we stayed:We stayed at the El Refugio Mochilero Backpackers , which was not our first choice ( we found it way overpriced for what you get ) . Double rooms are ARS300 . We wanted to stay at Antarctica Hostel which looked great but was fully booked for the next two weeks . <p> How we got to Ushuaia:We hitchhiked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The bus from Rio Grande was ARS140 and took two hours . <p> How to get from Punta Arenas to Ushuaia : - Bus-Sur- ( CLP35,000 ) Taqsa and Tecni-Austral both have several buses a week ( not daily though , so check their schedules ) that go directly from Punta Arenas to Ushuaia and vice versa . <p> How to get out of Ushuaia:The best way to get back north is actually by plane we found that plane tickets to Buenos Aires did n't  cost us much more as a 3-day bus ride would have cost us . <p> Recommended number of days:Depends on what you are planning to do in Ushuaia . If you 'd like to head out on tour of the Beagle Channel , visit Tierra Del Fuego National Park , see a couple of the museums in town , and see the Martial Glacier , you can easily fill four days in Ushuaia. 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 36 Comments <p> This is an amazingly in-depth overview of the region . I wish I 'd had it to read last year when I was there . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get places and ended up missing out on a lot of Chile . Not going to Pucon is one of my regrets . <p> I agree that Patagonia is expensive and the long distances are off putting , but is n't it the most beautiful place you 've ever been ? Hiking will never be the same again ! <p> How you planned this trip to Patagonia being vegetarians ? I mean was it difficult to find veggie food in those places ? Because I 'm vegan and I want to do a trip like this in Patagonia next year . I really want to do this , so itd be interesting if there were veggie options at least in the " checkpoint " places through the route . ( : <p> Hey there ! Ive been enjoying reading through your blog . I 'm headed to chile and argentin in a few weeks . I thought I had everything planned but a flight time chNge to Ushuaia has really put a wrench in my plans . I 'm looking at taking a bus from puerto natales/punta arenas to Ushuaia . Did you find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could book it would be about 4 days prior . Would that be enough time ? Or do some companies allow you to make reservations online ? I 'd appreciate any insight you can offer ! <p> Hi Rosemarie , it depends on when you are looking to go in the high season ( December ) buses can fill up , but we were always able to go to the bus station the day before we wanted to go and were able to still get tickets . That said , we traveled in February / March , when it was n't as busy anymore . Four days prior should still be plenty though . I would refrain from booking tickets online , but that 's just me being a bit paranoid about getting ripped off . Enjoy your trip ! <p> Hi ! Two friends and I are planning a trip for early February . Were flying in from BA ( not driving ) so we planned on doing one location . Do you have a strong recommendation in terms of must see from the Argentina side ? <p> Hi Carrie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free hikes in the area and the scenery is stunning ( Fitzroy ) . You might even be able to combine it with a visit to El Calafate because I believe that 's where the closest airport to El Chalten is , and Perito Moreno Glacier only needs one day . Its easy to get to El Chalten from the airport , I think there were buses that went directly there . Enjoy Patagonia = <p> Thanks so much for the tips ! Patagonia is such a special place . I filmed a short video while I was down there ( though it does n't  even begin to capture the beauty of the place ) : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Jt2RbGOHXv0 <p> Hi there ! First , thank you SO much for this ! I am currently planning my trip to Patagonia in February of next year ! I am currently planning on traveling alone though . As females did you guys feel comfortable and safe during your travels in Patagonia ? Would you recommend it for a lone female traveler ? <p> I felt definitely safe everywhere in Patagonia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think its one of the safest areas in all of South America , and you 'll bump into other solo travelers everywhere FOR SURE , Kerry . Have a great trip ! <p> Hi Dany , Thank you SO much for this posting . You saved my girlfriend and I from having to reinvent the wheel . Were leaving for our year-long RTW trip on Aug 18 and plan to work in 3-4 week of Patagonia in November . We took your route and cut out some areas . Take a look at our blog posting , you were crucial in helping us put together a reasonable budget and itinerary : <p> Hi Scott , I am so happy to hear that ! I was looking for a post like this when I planned our route , and when I could n't find one , I knew I had to write one = So happy to see Chiloe included in your route ! ! And that you 're doing the entire W trek the one thing I regret not doing in Patagonia ! Enjoy your trip ! <p> I am so glad I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to South America at the end of this year , and about a month of it will be spent south of Pucon . This is so helpful . I cant wait to check out the rest of your write ups ! <p> Thank you so much for posting this ! I 'm living in Buenos Aires now , and starting to plan a solo hiking trip to Patagonia for 2016 . There are so many options , and the distances between many of the sites are large , that its overwhelming . Your post is so helpful for cutting through all of that ! <p> Thanks guys ! Great detailIve used this as a starting point as I had very little plan and its going to be high season ! Do you think its possible to head further south on the Chilean side before crossing over to the Argentinean side and then going from Ushuaia backwards from there to see the Argentinian side ? Not sure if it works logistically ? <p> Thanks so much , Gemma ! We did actually go as far south in Chile as we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tierra Del Fuego . We assumed there were buses from Porvenir to Usuhaia but learned that there werent any only trucks go down that route ! We had to hitchhike because we did n't  want to return to Punta Arenas from where we 'd taken the ferry ( and from where buses go to Ushuaia , but not daily , if I remember it correctly ) . here 's our hitchking post : LONG ... If you 're adventurous , then go for it = <p> Hey guys ! Thanks so much for your postI used your post as inspiration ! Currently in Ushuaia ! Hitchhiked here from Punta Arenas and had the best experience ! Thanks for all the information , tips and tricks for all the areas ! <p> Hey ! I want to go to the glacier and do the w-hike over the holidays but am looking for accompany ! Someone ? = I 'm a 24 year old easygoing Swedish girl who has some hiking experience from Scandinavia but will need to hire all equipment here . Get in touch ! = <p> Hi Dani , You have done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really helpful for me . I have been checking the best routes on google map and possible stays in other sites and at the end of the day I landed here . You have given a very comprehensive detail of the trip and it gives me confidence to travel by bus/ferry from Santiago to Ushuaia . Was wondering if the bus trip back to BA will be worth but it could be a strenuous journey . I am planning to go on SA tour in Oct Nov . Hope it will be good season to visit . Will follow your travels and am also a solo traveler : ) . I have been to Kenya Fec 2014 and am going to New Zealand this September . I realized how addcited am to traveling and glad to see many like you . Cheers = <p> Yes , travel is definitely addictive = Kenya is one of my dream destinations ! And I 'll have to make it to NZ one day Sigh , too many places ! ! As for your question : the bus takes about 48 hours from Ushuaia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bus , two full days .. I was already going stir-crazy on the 27-hour ride from Bariloche to El Chalten So for me itd be worth it to fly , but flights are expensive ( at least $200 , but you might be lucky and get a good deal ) . Enjoy Patagonia its truly magical ! <p> Thanks Dani . I am planning to take a boat from Quellon to Puerto Chacabaco . From there by bus to Villa OHiggins with sptover at Cochrane . There is a way to cross the border by hiking , boat , bus to El Chalten . From then on I will be going the same way as you did except the Porvenis : ) . Hope I make it a reality . <p> Hey , I took quite a few flights in Argentina ! With everything that was going on with the peso recently flying was the same cost as the buses ! The only thing you need to consider is do you want to fly , have a good nights sleep in a hostel , or save money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Buenos Aires . I do n't  remember the exact price but when I checked at the time it was on par with the bus prices ! This was in December just gone ! <p> Thank you so much for your post ! I am planning a similar trip with my boyfriend but I feel we might have to fly somewhere due to time constraints , its so hard to decide what to cut out though ! Just wondering how long your trip took start to finish and if you know how much you spent all up including food etc ? <p> Hi Chelsie , I think we spent about three weeks in Patagonia and it was pretty pricey . We averaged around $50 per day per person , but that included private rooms and we ate out at least once a day . Argentina and Chile are both not cheap , but you can do it cheaper if you stay in dorms instead of private rooms and if you prepare more meals yourselves .. Luckily the hostels all have kitchens = How much time do you think you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so much info and I love the map ! We are heading there late Jan 2017 but starting in the opposite direction with Ushuaia because we have a cruise booked to Antarctica = then we will make our way up slowly to Bariloche pretty much following the route you have done and now I have seen your post on Pucon we will add that to the list too . We will bus it all the way but we will stop in Perito Merino to see the Marble Caves its a good half way point between El Chalten and Bariloche . All the info on the buses is great because it took me a couple of days to research buses out of Ushuaia ! I am reading all your Argentina , Chile and Uruguay blogs and I love your recommendations on places to visit , transportation and places to stay . <p> This was amazing to read , exactly everything I 've been trying to google in the one post ! I love the route you did and might customise a bit to fit my entry point which will be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought reaching what sounds like unreachable places . Now I just need to hope that all the buses are still running in winter which is when I will be there . <p> Hi Debby , yes you can . Roads are n't  paved all the way through and there 's a long stretch of nothing in between ( it took us around 24 hours on the bus to pass through this nomansland ) but its totally doable = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142970 @2542970/ <h> 5 reasons why Cuzco is worth a trip <p> About 99% of people who are visiting Peru are visiting Cuzco " however , most of them are only passing through . Cuzco is the gateway to Machu Picchu , the mystic Inca town that is set high up in Andes Mountains , often referred to as the Lost City Of The Incas . Cuzco is often overlooked as a destination in itself " but it is so worth a visit , even if there was no Machu Picchu nearby ! I spent about ten days in Cuzco when I did the Salkantay Trek ( I have yet to share the highlights of the trek with you , but I guarantee you , the photos will make you want to hop on the next flight ! So instead of planning to just pass through Cuzco on your way to Machu Picchu , consider spending a few nights here " trust me , you wo n't regret it . Here are my top five reasons why Cuzco is worth a trip : <h> 1 A gem of a city <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list they do n't pay too much attention to Cuzco , but let me tell you : Cuzco is actually a gem of a city , with beautiful architecture , an impressive cathedral , a gorgeous Plaza De Armas , fantastic shopping for local handicraft and woolen textiles ( there are several markets around town that sell everything from blankets to pottery ) and a number of festivals throughout the year . Plus , it is located in a stunning setting , nestled in the Andes Mountains . I never got tired wandering the streets of Cuzco , marveling at the ornate wooden balconies , getting lost in the streets and stumbling across little plazas and charming churches . You might be lucky to catch local dance groups in their traditional dresses while you 're there . <h> 2 The amazing food scene <p> Cuzco is without a doubt one of the culinary hot spots in all of Peru und I highly recommend indulging in a few tasty meals in one of Cuzco 's many outstanding restaurants . You can sample both local but also international cuisine here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , you will appreciate a Mexican breakfast , sushi or French bakery treats . If you 're looking to try Peruvian food , do n't leave without eating cuy ( guinea pig ) , an alpaca steak , lomo saltado ( beef tips stir-fried with spices , tomatoes , onion and spices , served with french fries and rice ) , aji de gallina ( chicken in a yellow pepper sauce with olives and hard-boiled eggs ) , or papa rellena ( stuffed potato with vegetables or beef , olives , hard-boiled egg and spices ) . A personal favorite of mine were papas a la huancaina ( Peruvian potatoes in a creamy cheese sauce ) , and I am still dreaming of the tasty Pisco Sours I had in Cuzco. <h> 3 An abundance of ancient Inca culture <p> Yes , we all know about Machu Picchu , the world famous Inca city high up in the Andes Mountains that attracts 1.2 million visitors every year . But did you know that there are TEN other Inca sites in the close vicinity of Cuzco ( all doable as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth a visit ? Some of the most spectacular ones include : Choquequirao ( often referred to as Machu Picchu 's sister city because of how similar they look ) , Pisac , Moray ( with its famous landscaping of co-centric circles ) , Ollantaytambo , Sacsayhuaman , Q'enqo , Puca Pucara , Huchuy Cusco , Tipon ( for the agricultural terraces ) , the Maras Salineras ( salt pans for salt production ) and the Templo de la Luna. <h> 4 Beautiful San Blas- - - - - - - - - - - <p> San Blas is a neighborhood in Cuzco , and yes , you should visit the city for this neighborhood alone I fell head over heels in love with it when I visited Peru and insisted on staying in a guesthouse there , and not in any other part of town . It is without a doubt the most picturesque neighborhood of Cuzco , perched on a hillside , with narrow , steep cobblestone streets . Nearly all of the buildings here are white , adorned with colorful doors and wooden balconies . The higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red tiled roofs , and you 'll find several cafes with rooftop terraces here . There are also little shops , restaurants and bars in this neighborhood " San Blas is so adorable that you 'll spend hours here taking photos " wait till you get there and you 'll see what I mean ! <h> 5 Trekking Galore <p> You do n't even have to do the Inca Trail to do a spectacular trek " there are many other treks around Cuzco that are worth the challenge of high altitude hiking ( most treks are above 15,000 feet ) . If you love trekking , Cuzco is a great base to go on one or several multi-day hikes . Almost all treks end in Machu Picchu , even though the ways to get there are as plentiful as they are diverse : you can take the Lares Route through the Lares Valley ( 3 4 days ) , take the Chasci Trail , you can even opt for an easy 1-day trek to Machu Picchu . If you are looking for even more of a challenge , I recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 days . Check out National Geographic 's Top Six Alternative Treks To Machu Picchu for more trails.When I visited Cuzco , I opted for the Salkantay Trek , one of the more challenging treks around Cuzco ( possibly even the most difficult way to get to Machu Picchu ? ) and the rewards in form of spectacular scenery , including the magnificent sacred Salkantay Mountain ( 20,500 feet high ! ) , were more than worth the blisters . Tip : If you 're planning to hike to Machu Picchu but ca n't get a spot on the Inca Trail , which is often booked out months in advance , consider one of the alternative treks , which are often half the price . The 5-day Salkantay trek for example cost me less than $250 , whereas the 4-day Inca Trail starts at around $600 . Have you been to Cuzco ? If you can add another reason why Cuzco is worth a trip , feel free to share it in the comments below ! 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Cuzco seems like a really charming city , I definitely plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picchu trip ! <p> I was originally planning on just taking the train to MP , but looking at the photos from your trek , Im now really intrigued to trek it there ! Looking forward to your post about that journey ! What time of year did you visit ? <p> I loved our trek so much . We were there in January . There are also easier treks than the Salkantay you 'll hear all about them once you get to Cuzco because all the travel agencies will try to sell you one = It felt like such an achievement to arrive in Cuzco the way the Incas did .. on foot , after a challenging walk through the mountains . No matter how you arrive though , Machu Picchu will blow your mind = <p> Oh I am so jealous , Rebecca ! ! Enjoy the trek its such a memorable experience = And Cusco is a great place to also recover from the trek and enjoy some great meals after the basic meals during the trek = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

I could n't have asked for a better way to end 2016 ! <p> This month was packed with travels and awesome experiences I left Mexico and flew- to LA ( my third visit this year ! ) for a long weekend , and then from there to Santa Rosa in Northern California for a week of wine tastings and Redwoods explorations . And then finally , after 15 weeks away , I returned to New York ! It felt amazing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't  get to enjoy NYC ( all decked out for Christmas ! ) for too long though , because I went to Germany in time for Christmas to spend the Holidays with my family . During my time in NYC , I managed to fit in a whole bunch of activities that I hoped would get me in the Christmas spirit : seeing the famous- Christmas lights in Dyker Heights , ice skating , marveling at the Christmas decorations on 5th Avenue and the Rockefeller Christmas Tree . And there was just enough time to satisfy my cravings for a good New York bagel , New York pizza , banana bread pudding from Magnolias Bakery , and a few catch-up sessions with some friends . <p> And then .. Christmas ! This was only my second Christmas with my family since 2007 , so I was over the moon to be able to visit several Christmas markets , bake a whole bunch of Christmas cookies and make a massive Christmas dinner for my family ( I even made a roast duck " trying to ignore- the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holidays with my sister , my brother , my nieces and my nephew , I was ready for some city life after a few days in the countryside at my sister 's house , and so I decided on a whim to escape to Berlin " a great decision , as it turned out , because I had an amazing week there , that included more Christmas markets , lots of beer , Turkish and Lebanese food , some sightseeing and New Years Eve with someone special.Let 's take a look at my December highlights before I share my most embarrassing travel mishap ever with you in the lowlights : <h> Highlights <p> Christmas markets in Germany <p> I love German Christmas markets , and they are part of the reason why I think I should go to Germany for the Holidays more often . I enjoyed several visits to the beautiful Christmas market in my hometown Erfurt , and thanks to the extended opening times of several of Berlin 's Christmas markets ( most of them close a couple of days before Christmas Eve ) I got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas . I love everything about them : sipping Gluhwein ( mulled wine ) and Eierpunsch ( eggnog with white wine ) , eating chocolate covered fruit and sugar roasted nuts and almonds , all the fried Christmas market food , and wandering the aisles lined with wooden huts selling- Christmas gifts and souvenirs . <p> I 've been to various Christmas markets in the US and also in the UK over the years , but I have to say : they just do n't compare to the original German Christmas markets . I hope one year I can take an extended tour of the country 's most famous Christmas markets , since I have never been to popular ones like Rothenburg or Dresden , and I would love to return to some of the ones I loved when I visited them years ago , such as Frankfurt , Cologne or Nuremberg . <p> A long weekend in LA <p> After my extended stay in September and a few days in town in November , I found myself back in Los Angeles for the third time at the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LA at the same time , my visit turned out a bit different than I thought it would . Instead of spending all weekend with my favorites Jen , Chris and Henry in Long Beach , I ended up having a rather touristy weekend with sightseeing ( Griffith Observatory , sunset drinks in Downtown L.A. , exploring the Arts District ) , microbrewery hopping , a tour of Venice and Venice Beach and ticking one thing off of my LA foodie bucket list : California Donuts . I am not a big fan of regular doughnuts , but I love artisanal doughnuts from places like the Doughnut Plant in New York or Voodoo Donuts in Austin . So California Donuts had to happen and they did not disappoint ( albeit not coming anywhere close to my all-time favorites from New York 's Doughnut Plant ) . <p> Ice skating in New York <p> This one made my 16 favorite travel moments of 2016 " Ice skating in Bryant Park . Ice skating in New York was something I 'd been wanting to do even long before I ever thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with all the ice rinks in the city during the winter , there 's no shortage of options . I had set my eyes on- two particular ice rinks though : Bryant Park in Midtown Manhattan and Wollman Rink in Central Park " both have great views of Manhattan 's skyscrapers . I did n't make it onto the ice once last year , even though I watched people on the ice on those rinks and the one in Prospect Park , but I never happened to be with someone who enjoyed ice skating as well . <p> But this year , I finally made it happen ! And it was glorious . The best part was that my friend Kristin and I went early , around 8.30am on a week day ( the benefit of being my own boss and setting my own hours .. ) which meant the ice rink was fairly empty . I had n't been on an ice rink in years , but I quickly got back into it and am already looking forward to next winter 's ice skating season . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many invites from Tourism Boards but an LGBT-focused wine trip to Santa Rosa and Sonoma Wine Country sounded too good to pass up . And I am glad I did ! I loved seeing the picturesque landscape of Sonoma County in the fall , the vine leaves while they were changing colors , and hike in the Redwoods on a crisp autumn day . And of course I toured a bunch of wineries " not only did I get to taste some fantastic wines but I also learned so much about wines and wine production . - I ca n't wait to share more about this trip with you . <h> Lowlights <p> Leaving my laptop on a plane <p> It 's official : 2016 was the year with the most travel mishaps ever . I left a pair of $300 headphones on a plane earlier this year , I lost a brand new jacket , damaged two camera lenses ( irreparable ) , broke my phone several times , lost a number of battery /Kindle / phone chargers and other things . <p> On my flight from New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left my laptop on the plane from JFK to Heathrow . I only noticed it when I , upon changing terminals to catch my connecting flight to Berlin , I had to go through security again and was asked to take my laptop out of my bag . Only that my laptop was n't in there ! I had finished a freelance article on the plane that was due that very same day , and had put the laptop on the seat next to me after I was done and simply forgot to put it back in my bag . To my defense I want to say that I only slept two hours on that red eye flight , but still , considering that this laptop is pretty much my livelihood , this was a massive mistake , and ended up stressing me so much that I burst into tears in the airport . The BA employees werent very- helpful at first , not allowing me to go back to terminal 3 to try to retrieve my laptop , because they thought I might miss my connecting flight . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about was getting my laptop back . After a lot of begging and pleading I made it back to terminal 3 and to the Virgin counter , and my laptop had been found and handed in . I was over the moon when I was reunited with the most valuable item I own and I made it back to terminal 5 just in time to board my flight to Berlin . <p> I loved every place I went to this month . They all made me quickly forget the stress of my travel mishap . <p> Getting sick on the road <p> I had my fair share of getting sick on the road incidents this year , with a short stint in the hospital in the Amazon in March , food poisoning in Colombia in January and again in Mexico in November , but this month , I got really scared when I got sick on my wine trip in Santa Rosa and was n't even sure if I 'd be able to board my flight from California to New York , afraid my appendix might burst 30,000 feet above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe abdominal pain , until I was ready to finally see a doctor ( thinking I might not make it through a trans-Atlantic flight ) " when the pain suddenly disappeared . I am still not sure what this was , but will definitely get a proper check-up before I leave Germany , especially since several of my friends have had terrible health scares in recent months ( including a burst appendix ) . <p> Pain free again and able to enjoy the Christmas lights in New York and the sights , cakes and food of Berlin ! <p> Other happenings <p> I ended the year with two great awards " being included in Meg 's Lesbian Travel Awards and in Travel Fashion Girl 's Top Female Travel Blogs ! Check both of them out for other queer blogs / female travel blogs : <h> What 's next for me <p> I have to admit that visiting my family for the Holidays was not the only reason for my spontaneous trip to Germany this month I have hinted here and there about a huge , possibly life changing event that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual reason for my Germany trip , and I hope that I can finally spill the beans on it next month . <p> I am going to eat all the hummus .

@@107142973 @2542973/ <h> How much does it cost to travel in Uruguay ? <p> Like neighboring Argentina , Chile and Brazil , traveling in Uruguay is not cheap and you often spend the same amount as when traveling in the U.S. and Europe , but if you 're looking to match the same level of quality in hotels or food , it is there , but you 'll actually have to spend a bit more in Uruguay to get it . <p> The upside ? Fellow travelers had warned us that prices in Uruguay would be even higher than in Argentina , more than 20% higher they said ! However , with the exception of glitzy Punta del Este , we found there to be no real difference between tourist-friendly areas in both countries . <p> For short-term travelers looking for a vacation in Uruguay , budget in the same that you would for a vacation in the U.S. or Europe . For long-term travelers , we 'd say that unless you 're an extreme shoestring traveler , plan in a daily budget of US$45 per person , based on two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be confusing , as prices are marked U$S100 vs when prices are in US dollars US100 . For the rest of this post , the use of the dollar sign is for prices in US dollars , Uruguayan pesos will be marked UYU . <h> Budget breakdown <p> Our own average spending worked out to $50.68 per person , or US$101.37 for the two of us , per day , and we spent $1,419.20 in two weeks . Spikes in inflation and tricky currency exchanges being the norm in Argentina and Uruguay , we want to clarify that we spent 27,021 Uruguayan Pesos at an exchange rate of UYU19.04 per 1 USD at the time of our visit . . <p> Here is a breakdown of our costs : <p> As usual , accommodation was the biggest expense , followed by food and transportation . Our love of coffee cost us an additional UYU60 / $3.25 each per day as well , for just basic Americano-type coffee . <p> Miscellaneous expenses included laundry ( UYU260/$13.66 ) , postcards , stamps and a few souvenirs . <h> Cost of accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we stayed primarily in hostels and guest houses rather than hotels . Because we were traveling just after the end of high season , we used Booking.com to find discounts on accommodation , which many hotels offer once their hotels clear out after February . If you are traveling in Uruguay between December and February , expect to pay at least 20 per cent more per night . <p> At Posada Del Sur in Montevideo , we paid $50 for a comfortable double room , shared bathroom and full breakfast , and $42 for a double room at Hostel De La Viuda in Punta del Diablo , a hostel we absolutely loved . For $44 , our hostel in Colonia was sub-par and far out of town . <p> Montevideo <p> When booking hotels , a private budget room runs for $55 , a private in a hostel is between $35 " $40 . Beds in dorm rooms cost $10-$14 . <p> During low season ( March " October ) you can snatch a double room in a 4-star hotel for $80 $100 . <p> If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , there are huge discounts that can get you room rates almost as low as during low season in Montevideo and at the beaches , but not in Colonia which is busy year round . <p> The Beaches <p> Punta del Este is considerably more expensive than the rest of Uruguay 's coastline . We hunted down a great deal on a hotel , including full buffet breakfast for less than $60 , right in the center of town . This was partially because we were there in the Summer-Fall shoulder season , but most rooms run $100-$130 in March still . If you book far enough in advance , there are double rooms in hostels and budget hotels for $50-$60 , which usually include a full breakfast . Dorm beds average $18- $20 . <p> Expect prices to double around Christmas and at the end of February , which is summer vacation for Uruguay and Argentina ; even dorm beds go up to $35 . <p> Even though Punta Del Diablo is slightly more affordable , prices for a decent double room are still up to $100 during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various occasions that , if you are planning to travel in Uruguay during high season , you should make sure to book a hotel / hostel months before you get there . The best places are booked out up to five months before high season , and you will find yourself left with mediocre options at outrageous prices . <p> Colonia del Sacramento <p> Due to weekend visitors from Buenos Aires renewing visas or withdrawing dollars and tourists traveling from around South America , Colonia del Sacramento sees tourists fill so many rooms year round that even taxi drivers ca n't keep up with the new hostels and budget hotels popping up further and further outside the city center . There are several beautiful boutique hotels and B&amp;Bs for $90 " $130 in Colonia , decent double rooms in a hostel or budget hotel for about $50 $60 and dorm beds between $13 and $16 , but only if you book ahead . If not , it 's a game of roulette " one which we played and lost . <p> Tip : Almost all hostels and hotels in Uruguay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible ; it will save you a lot of money , especially at the beaches . <h> Cost of food in Uruguay <p> Prices for eating out are about the same as it is in the U.S. " sometimes even more , and especially if you want any level of quality . To put price comparison into perspective , a 6-inch veggie delight Subway sandwich cost UYU90 at the time of our visit , or $4.73 , when in the U.S. you can get $5 foot-long subs . <p> Vegetarian dinner for two cost UYU400-500 , or $22-$27 , and when we cooked at the guest house , the groceries still averaged UYU 300 / $15 for a full meal . <p> Going out for coffee , one of our favorite past times , was outrageously expensive at the beaches , with a cup of coffee or cappuccino costing around UYU100 / $5 , two ice cream cones were UYU150 / $7.88 and just going out for coffee and cake set us back UYU420 / $22 in Punta del Este . <h> Cost of transportation in Uruguay <p> Buses between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus ride . Uruguay is a small country , so the two longest distances cost UYU 420 / $22 per person from Montevideo to Punta del Diablo and UYU455 /$24 from Punta Del Este to Colonia del Sacramento . Shorter bus rides , for example from Punta Del Diablo to La Paloma , were UYU215 / US$12 per person . Considering that these prices are from bus terminal to bus terminal , the Summer Bus , which includes hostel pick-up and hostel drop-off in 12 beach towns for $75 , is actually not a bad deal at all . <p> Ferry tickets with Buquebus from Montevideo or Colonia to Buenos Aires start at UYU760 /$36.30 ( one way , if booked in advance ) . <h> Cost of entertainment in Uruguay <p> Entertainment costs were actually our smallest expense . The most expensive activity we splurged on was renting bicycles in Montevideo , which cost us UYU200 / $10 per person for a four-hour rental . A 6-hour surfing course for beginners in Punta Del Este is UYU1900 ( $100 ) , a half-day city sightseeing tour in Montevideo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few dollars and the majority of activities in Uruguay is free . <h> Money saving tips for Uruguay : <p> 1Travel in the shoulder season . If you travel in the dead of the winter ( May " October ) most of the beach towns will be completely shut down , but if you travel on either side of high season , you get great weather , less busy towns and much less expensive accommodation rates compared to high season months of December , January and February . <p> 2 Do n't pay for water . You can drink the water everywhere in Uruguay , and you can ask for tap water in restaurants at no extra charge . <p> 3 Cook for yourself whenever possible After accommodation , eating in restaurants was our biggest expense in Uruguay . We went to the supermarket and bought ingredients for pasta , sandwiches or stews and soups for a fraction of the price ( and time ) spent in restaurants . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 10 Comments <p> I absolutely love these in depth budget posts ! I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them and kudos to you for such detailed budget tracking . Now , can you please travel to every country I want to go to and do this research for me ? = <p> If you 're travelling in Argentina using the blue dollar rate , then Uruguay is indeed about 20% more expensive . I think this is why it was such a shock to us . I actually just wrote a similar article about Bolivia ( before I saw this , I promise ! ) , and reading this now reminds me of how Uruguay is really in another league all together in terms of cost of travel in South America ! <p> I guess its all about perspective the people we met in Uruguay who had been traveling through Brazil before that were crying tears of joy about the affordable prices in Uruguay = I guess the prices wouldve shocked us more had we had lived on the Blue dollar in Argentina but Uruguay was actually the first place for us where we were able to get some dollars before heading back to Argentina . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuego we traveled through before flying to Uruguay were still more expensive and certainly not cheaper than most places in Uruguay , even with the Blue Dollar rate . About your Bolivia post well it looks like well copy you with that when we make it there later this year were planning to do a budget post for each country = You can still beat us to Argentina and Chile = <p> Yes , absolutely its relative . I guess , since we were in Patagonia at the beginning of our time in South America ( and we did n't  go as far south as you ) , we 'd forgotten about it by the time we got to Uruguay three months later ! <p> I do n't  think I 'll be writing about the cost of Argentina any more , because I already did an in depth piece about the blue rate etc. , and as for Chile , I do n't  think we visited enough of the country for it to be worthwhile sharingyet. = Anyway , itll be interesting to see how you guys find Bolivia in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in April .

However , the New York apartment gods felt sorry for me I lucked out and found a room two days later , just a few blocks north from the housesit on the Upper West Side . <p> Living on the Upper West Side means that you are right by Central Park .. one of my favorite spots in the city . <p> The homeowners had planned another trip in late June , so I decided to stay at least until then and help them out during their shorter getaway ( the other housesit would have been for a month ) . In that time , ads for shorter summer housesits in New York City started to appear . I lucked out and scored two housesits in Brooklyn for July , which made me extend my stay for another month . I had n't  had any intentions of spending so much time in New York , but the longer I stayed , the more addicted I got to the city . <p> Prospect Lefferts Gardens , a beautiful Brooklyn neighborhood I got to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to rely on ads while I was waiting for my July gigs to start , I told more and more people I met that I was a petsitter , staying in New York partially housesitting and partially subletting , and people usually listened up when I explained I did n't  charge for my petsitting services in return for accommodation . In a city where people are used to paying money for just about anything , they were ecstatic to hear that I was looking after pets FOR FREE ! Through word-of-mouth , I ended up looking after two adorable cats in the East Village in June , the cutest puppy on the planet in Crown Heights in August and another kitty cat in a fancy Chelsea apartment right off the High Line Park . And this was another First for me : because people I knew vouched for me , none of the word-of-mouth gigs wanted to check any references , they simply trusted my friends judgement . I would just get a text message saying something like A friend of mine needs a catsitter for the first two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to turn down some gigs because of timing issues . <p> The apartment was right off Prospect Park , Brooklyns answer to Manhattans Central Park , which I loved for two reasons : 1 . It made it impossible NOT to go on a daily run Prospect Park is just gorgeous . 2 . I was there during the Philharmonic in the Park summer series , during which the renowned New York philharmonic orchestra gives free concerts in the park . With the spacious kitchen in my apartment I was able to make some yummy salads and snacks for a picnic with friends , and was home after the concert in twenty minutes , not having to take the subway . One of my favorite days of the summer . Also and that 's what I love most about housesitting thanks to the dog I got to know a neighborhood I wouldve never visited , taking her on sightsee-walks around the different historic streets . And Lefferts Gardens is a very cool hood I am glad I had the chance to explore it . <p> The Philharmonic Orchestra in Prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short walk from there . <p> Looking after an insanely cute bundle of fur named Little Monkey brought me to my favorite apartment and second favorite neighborhood I discovered this summer : Crown Heights . This up-and-coming area with its vibrant Caribbean community and a ( quite recent ) large influx of hipsters , made for an interesting mix of trendy eateries and coffee shops with traditional chicken joints and Caribbean supermarkets . I loved the vibe in my neighborhood , especially on Saturday nights when most families were hanging out on their stoops , a boom box in the window silt , speakers turned towards the street . I 've never heard as much B.I.G . as during my time in Crown Heights = But the best bit about this housesit was that I did n't  only have a giant kitchen ( even with washer and dryer , almost unheard of in NYC ) , but also a big dining room . I had to take advantage of this and invited some friends over for a dinner party something most sublets just do n't  allow for . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loved it ! <p> It was also interesting to see how different each apartment was ( and how much it was to live there , in those cases when the owners shared that information with me ) , and I took my housesits as an opportunity to check out different neighborhoods around town to see where I 'd want to sublet next . While I was still pondering about my sublet location for August , I came across a housesit in Carroll Gardens on Mindmyhouse.com . Carroll Garden is a neighborhood close to Brooklyn Heights , where I housesat last year for a couple of months and which I loved I had also briefly been to Carroll Gardens back then and remembered it as a beautiful residential neighborhood with gorgeous brownstones . Applying for this gig was a no-brainer . I sent my application before breakfast and after dinner on the same day I received the keys to the lovely top floor apartment to take care of an elderly cat the coming week . This was n't a first , by the way , but happened all summer long : most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. so pretty . <p> I finished my housesitting adventures this summer with a week in a brand new apartment in Chelsea , dubbed as Luxurious High Line Apartments in big letter on the side of the building . This apartment made me wish to be rich enough to afford a place like that , and I could n't have asked for a more perfect place to finish up my summer in New York in . Had my visa not expired , I could have done another three housesits this month , but I 'll patiently wait to return next year for more housesitting adventures in New York . <p> I walked the entire length of the High Line Park five times in my last week in NYC , because the apartment I took care of was a two-minute walk from the park . <h> My tips for securing a housesit in New York City <p> I have to admit that I had quite a few advantages when I applied for a housesit a ) I was in town already , something that helped with each and every application , b ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just email me about returning a few days later and I could always say Sure , no problem at all , or owners werent sure about the exact dates until the very last minute also something that I was able to accommodate with . I realize that when you agree to a housesit while you 're not in the same location , it is n't as easy to be flexible , considering you have to book flights and make other travel arrangements . However , here are my top tips for scoring a housesit in New York : <p> You have to be flexible . If you are 100% set on your dates , it will be almost impossible to find a gig . If you decide you want to spend a week in New York in the spring , its much easier to find a housesit in that period . In your application , make sure to put the owners needs first though , not yours ( Date XX is when I need to be in NYC : Wrong attitude ! ) <p> My Crown Heights dogsit : a gig I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to housesit . With it came a blender ( which I miss dearly whenever I do n't  have one ) and a super cute dog = <p> If you 're in New York already , make sure to mention this . I got most of my gigs because the owners knew I was around and could meet them in person before they trusted me with their pets and apartments . Mention it right in the subject line of your application . My friends Nat &amp; Jodie who run the Housesitting World Magazine ( packed with housesitting stories and advice , 100% free to download onto your iPad ! ) also scored two gigs in NYC because they were already in town . <p> Be modest in your expectations . While I looked after some stunning properties around the world , I noticed that the apartments in NYC were much more ordinary . Several times , owners would even apologize for either their apartments or neighborhoods . I never felt uncomfortable in an apartment I looked after , but none of them were comparable to some of the exquisite suburban houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talk about your desire to housesit in NYC . If you 're there already , therell be people in need of a petsitter in your network already co-workers , friends , or friends of friends . Post about it on Facebook or ask your NYC-based friends to ask around if you 're not based in NYC . I was amazed how many word-of-mouth gigs I got this summer ( and I could n't even fulfill them all . ) The number of housesits on the housesitting websites is still pretty limited , and competition for them is fierce , but there is a much higher need for petsitters in the city than it appears . <p> My housesit in Crown Heights ( which I got through word-of-mouth ) was a ten-minute walk from the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens . I took advantage of the proximity and went there three times during the sit , enjoying the peace &amp; quiet . <p> Be fast . As I 've already mentioned competition for housesits in New York is extremely fierce . If you see an ad on one of the housesitting websites , apply immediately . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Carroll Gardens instead to apply right when I saw it in the morning , I might not have gotten it , because she had made her decision within a day . I also felt that way with other gigs as soon as the owners see a decent application , theyll go for it , not wanting to drag the process out and have their pet care sorted for the time they 're away . <p> Be aware of the responsibilities that come with the gig . A cat sit is usually easy ; you only have to feed the cat a couple of times a day and clean the litter . A dog , however , needs much more attention and care , including several walks a day . If you 're planning to tour New York , a dog sit might be too restricting . Also , evaluate how comfortable you are with i 'll pets this summer was the second time that I took care of an elderly sick cat that could have died during the sit .

@@107142978 @2542978/ <h> Polaroid Of The Week : L.A. At My Feet <p> This week I finally made it up to the famous Hollywood sign a hike that I 've been wanting to do for a while . After two failed attempts ( traffic , cloudy skies ) , I found myself scrambling up the rocks to a small hill above and behind the actual sign , which me and my hiking buddy reached after about an hours walk , just in time for a brilliant sunset . You cant get to the sign by car , the only way to get up , close and personal with these giant white letters that have become an American icon , is on foot or by horse , and you cant get in front of the letters , only above them . <p> Funnily enough , the sign did n't  have any association with the movie industry when it was put up in 1923 . Instead , it was supposed to promote local real estate during a time when the Hollywood Hills werent the prime real estate location that they are today . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hugh Hefner started a fundraiser to save the sign , and $250,000 were raised to restore the sign that had fallen into disrepair . <p> It used to be a bit tricky to get up to the sign until a few years ago , unless you were a local and knew your way around . The Trust For Public Land , - that is in charge of protecting the sign and the surrounding lands , has made it much easier now to find the right paths and not get lost in the relatively remote and rugged southern side of Mount Lee , on which the sign is located . There are now several hiking routes : the Mt Hollywood Trail ( short and moderately difficult ) , the Canyon Drive- Trail ( longest route ) , and the Cahuenga Peak Trail ( the shortest , but most challenging ) . We took a shorter version of the Mt Hollywood Trail , which can be started- at the Griffith Observatory ( 3.5 miles round trip ) or at Sunset Ranch at the northern end of N Beachwood Drive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . <p> The hike is pleasant , with sweeping views over parts of L.A. , Glendale and The Valley from various viewpoints along the way but the star of the show , the sign itself , stays out of sight- for the most part . We started our hike at Sunset Ranch , but next time I 'd start at the Griffith Observatory for a longer hike and better views of the sign itself . <p> When you get to the sign , the most astonishing thing is seeing how big these letters actually are : each letter is- 45 feet tall ( 14- meters ) and all of them next to each other are- 350 feet ( 110 meters ) long ! My height compared to it : 5.8 feet . <p> If you 're thinking about climbing the security fences that fence off the sign , be warned : the charges are no joke . Trespassers face- a $1000 fine , restitution to the City agencies involved in the trespassers arrest , a one-year probation period and 20 days on a Cal Trans highway crew . 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

At the top of the accommodation pyramid , there are three to five high-end luxury resorts that can charge upwards of $500 a night . That drops dramatically in the mid-range , which is why we opted to stay at Atacamadventure Wellness and Ecolodge . An eco-friendly boutique Bed And Breakfast , Atacamadventure offered exactly the kind of ( guilt-free ) pampering we are looking for a hot tub , pool , sauna , massage studio plus homemade organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and has incorporated a centuries ' old local irrigation technique that offers you lovely green spaces once you step inside this off-the-beaten path resort from the burnt orange desert dirt outside . <p> At a 30 minute walk outside of town , and further than most other hotels we could have chosen , it certainly felt off-the-beaten path . ( I admit : the walk could take as little as 15 minutes under other circumstances , but in either dry desert sun or pitch black darkness and the high altitude , we were huffing and puffing in a way that was like doing cardio at a leisurely stroll . ) <p> Although most resorts and even some hostels offer free pick-up and shuttle service into the downtown area , Atacamadventure does not . The taxi driver had never heard of it and it was an adventure finally landing upon this hidden hotel . <p> Once inside , however , this is a beautiful little escape . The first owner started taking in a boarder or two until she built on a separate cottage . Then , as time went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six are very different , and we were incredibly impressed with ours . First impression it was huge . King size bed ? Check . White fluffy pillows ? Four checks . Desk with a oddly professional office chair ? Check ( although this pressured me to actually get some writing done ! ) Walk-in closet with about twenty shelves ? Check . And the bathroom ! The bathroom alone was larger than most private hostel rooms available in San Pedro proper . We had hers and hers pedestal sinks , a jacuzzi tub and a stand-up jacuzzi shower , big white towels and fuzzy slippers . <p> After our long journey we skipped dinner and flopped down into bed . Even though we almost never watch TV , the receptionist had mentioned it when she was showing us around the room ( that 's how big the room was , she could show us around in it ) . But when my fingers crawled along the nightstand looking for the remote , they came up empty . There was , in fact , no TV in the room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell asleep five minutes later anyway . There is one large TV in the lounge upstairs to share , but the focus here , explained the manager , is on escape , powering down and soaking up the natural environment . <p> Refreshed and seriously starving , the next morning we could n't have been happier with the breakfast . We ordered made-to-order omelets from the short , no-nonsense cook in charge , who also showed us the fresh brewed coffee , tea , hot milk , bowls which we filled with fresh fruit , homemade yogurt and plate which we piled high with homemade cakes , bread slices , cheese , butter and jam . With our bellies full we headed into town to get some work done ( the wi-fi signal here was non-existent ) and returned in the afternoon with plans to hit the outdoor jacuzzi and sauna . Two older couples had beaten us to the jacuzzi and at $70 an hour , the infrared sauna was n't worth it , so instead Dani grabbed a glass of wine ( well-priced at $3 a glass ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprawled out on the white couches outside on the back patio and planned our time in Bolivia the coming week . <p> The hotel restaurant does offer a dinner menu each evening , but it is heavily meat-based and one thing we love most about San Pedro is the food selection in town ( everything from hearty pizzas to fine dining and three-course set menus from $10 ) so at sunset we hopped on two of the three bikes available and pushed the rusty pedals into town for dinner . The plan was to try out the giant telescope on the back patio when we got back that second night but it turns out we do n't really know how to work it . The idea was nice though , as star gazing is the number one evening past time here in the desert . <p> The breakfast selection the second morning was much more modest , but the rest of the morning went off without a hitch . I got in a long yoga session in our room , getting all the kinks out and calming my nerves for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big pillows in the comfortable lounge loft above the kitchen , editing photos and drinking bottomless cups of coffee from the breakfast bar the combination of coffee and photo editing puts Dani most definitely in what you could call her element ! <p> Leaving Atacamadventure was much easier than our arrival they simply called us a cab and hopped in and off we went to our big adventure . <p> Hotel Highlight : Relax factor Even though we loved our room , what we both loved even more was not having to stay in it to relax . There are many different areas to relax : inside upstairs in the lofted lounge and outside on several comfortable white couches or lounge chairs , plus the pool/jacuzzi area had deck chairs as well . It was so peaceful to sit outside , take in the fresh air and late afternoon sun , totally relaxed and saying hi to the other guests padding barefoot back and forth enjoying their spa time . <p> Room for improvement : Shuttle service and signage- There is apparently a law in San Pedro that prohibits hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which unfortunately for this hotel , means no one could ever possibly happen to see it . For that reason and the location itself , Atacamadventure needs to offer a shuttle service from pick up service at bus station around town to shuttle service that brings guests back and forth from town . <p> Overall Two relaxing and refreshing nights sleep later , we got what we came for , even without dipping our toe in the jacuzzi . Despite inconsistencies in quality ( breakfast , bikes and Wi-Fi that works ) Atacamadventure Wellness &amp; Ecolodge is a great little oasis outside San Pedro to shut off and relax for a few days at a time , especially before or better yet after the Bolivian salt flats tour . 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Situated above where two tectonic plates collide , Costa Rica has a spine of volcanic activity , from Rincon de la Vieja in the far north-west down to Turrialba in the centre . <p> The finest and most famous of them all is Arenal a perfect cinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a regular basis until a few years ago , Arenal is now a brooding beast , with no one sure if or when it will next roar into life . <p> For the time being , its lush foothills are the ideal place to take horseback rides and enjoy the spectacular nature all around you . <h> 2 . Zip-line above the canopy in Monteverde <p> Not far from Arenal are the cloud forests of Monteverde a haven for exotic birds and , as it turns out , adrenalin junkies . Get a birds eye view of the trees by strapping yourself in for a heart-stopping zip-lining tour . <p> With some wires as high as 100m off the ground and speeds reaching 50mph , zip-lining is not for the faint of heart , but if you 've got the nerve , its one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have on holiday . <h> 3 . Take a bird watching tour in Monteverde <p> While screaming over the treetops on a cable is thrilling , its not exactly the best way to appreciate the local wildlife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot just some of the 400 types of incredible bird that call the cloud forest home . Its truly breathtaking to see toucans in full flight and hopefully you 'll also be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of the resplendent quetzal , arguably the worlds most beautiful bird . <p> The Maya worshipped it as their god of the air , and when you lay eyes on its iridescent green feathers and 2ft-long tail , you 'll see why . <h> 4 . Cruise the Tortuguero canals <p> Visiting Tortuguero is like travelling to a lost world . This remote national park is a mixture of forest , swamps , canals and lagoons , and is home to a huge number of species . <p> Glide silently along the water keeping a sharp lookout for wildlife on the banks . <h> 5 . Stroll on a palm-fringed beach in Manuel Antonio <p> Costa Rica has the ideal beach conditions , with the scorching sunshine warming the sea to swimming pool temperatures and the tropical heat drying you off in seconds after a dip in the waves . <p> Throw in powdery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're as close to paradise as it gets . <p> Manuel Antonio on the Pacific coast is the ideal place to leave your footprints in the sand . <h> 2 Comments <p> See that little monkey at the start of this article ? He may be a relative of one the the half dozen who got quite angry when we pulled our camper in under their tree to spend the night at Manual Antonio . They started making all kinds of noise , as they jumped from limb to limb . Then they broke off twigs and limbs and started throwing them at us . We were so amused , that we obliged them by moving to another camping space . Did n't  want to upset the locals ! <p> Oh my , I know what you mean ! ! The monkeys were quite cheeky ( and yes , that photo was actually taken in Manuel Antonio ! ) and were begging for food everywhere the tourists keep feeding them though , which does n't  help the situation = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107142983 @2542983/ <h> GlobetrotterGirls Quick Guide to Santiago , Chile <p> Although it is one of the fastest growing and economically stable cities in Latin America , Santiago lacks many obvious tourist attractions of a Buenos Aires or a Rio but do n't let that mislead you . After spending seven weeks in the Chilean capital , we put together this list of stand out things that make the city truly unique and should n't be missed on a visit to Santiago . <h> Attractions in Santiago- <p> Set just inside the mighty Andes mountains , Santiago itself is mainly flat ( and great for cycling ) , but there are two cerros , or hills , right in the city center that afford perfect views of the city : <p> Cerro Santa Lucia <p> Santiago was founded right on this very spot , but nowadays Cerro Santa Lucia is known more as a scenic lookout . Located right by the trendy Lastarria neighborhood in central Santiago , on a clear day free of smog , visitors have fantastic views out onto the Andes and the city , but even on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its majestic fountains , Spanish tile work , European style mini-castle and gorgeous gardens on every level up to the top . <p> Cerro San Cristobal <p> Towering over the city is the Cerro San Cristobal lookout on top of Santiago 's second highest mountain . We scaled the hill on a 45-minute heart-pumping hike to the statue of Virgin Mary on top of the hill , but if steep hikes on uneven terrain are n't your idea of fun , you can either hop on the funicular ( when it 's working ) or take a free bus up to the top ( when it 's not ) . The Cerro is located north of the Bellavista neighborhood , which means you can combine this with a visit to Pablo Neruda 's house La Chascona at the bottom of the hill and a meal at one of the dozens of fabulous restaurants in the Patio Bellavista and surrounding area . <p> Mercado Central <p> For a fully functioning central market , the Mercado Central is one of the cleanest we 've visited . In particular , the fish market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall has clean , quaintly decorated restaurants for some of the freshest fish in the country . For a morelocalexperience , cross the river north of the Mercado Central and follow the foot traffic to Mercado Vega . This fruit and vegetable market is cheap and has excellent produce , as does the Mercado Vega Chica you 'll most likely pass through before the main market . A large market area itself , there are also little local eateries on the east side of the market . <p> Plaza De Armas is Santiago 's central plaza and home to kilometro zero , the point from which the city has continued to sprawl out in all directions to become home to now seven million inhabitants . The plaza is home to beautiful historic buildings such as the incredibly ornate Central Post Office , the Palacio de la Real Audiencia and , as in nearly every Latin American city , the main Cathedral . Modern glass buildings and skyscrapers are mixed in together with downtown 's historic monuments and the palm trees and benches that line the plaza make the Plaza de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral 's dull fa+ade is misleading " the inside is impressive and filled with gorgeous little details so make sure to stop in and cool off inside when you 're walking around downtown . <p> Cementerio General <p> Santiago 's massive Cemeterio General ( General Cemetery ) is one of the largest cemeteries we have visited anywhere on our travels " and with over two million burial places , it is easily one of the largest in all of Latin America . Chile 's former beloved Communist leader Salvador Allende is buried here with his family in a grand modern mausoleum down one of the many shady avenues lined with other palatial mausoleums . Equally awe-inspiring ' were the massive death condos ' , where coffins are slid for eternity into tiny slots in large constructions that look like condominium complexes . Most of the time these are open so that name plaques are visible to passersby , but there is one , frighteningly tall , multi-story building with hundreds of these plots inside , with plenty of space for friends and family to enter the building and walk up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit their loved ones . Scary ! <p> The cemetery is super easy to visit , just take the Yellow Metro Line to the aptly named Cementarios ' stop , and you come up right at one of the main gates . <p> Santiago Parks <p> Santiago is a surprisingly green city , with many parks and green areas all around town . If you are staying downtown , the Parque Forestral that runs parallel to the river north of the Lastarria neighborhood makes for great strolls or picnics and you will see many people laying in the grass reading or couples enjoying each other . In Parque Quinto Normal you can rent rowing boats on a little lake , and there are many hiking trails in the massive Parque Metropolitano . <p> Santiago Museums <p> Museo de la Memoria <p> It is easy to get distracted by the city 's flashy modern architecture , high brow cultural program , street art and great restaurants , but we say a trip to Santiago 's Human Rights Museum is a must in order to understand Chile 's very dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1990 . Tens of thousands were disappeared , more were brutally tortured and countless starved under this strict dictatorship and although so many Santiguenos were affected , people today are focused on growth and the future , so this was the only experience we had of learning about the regime in detail . <p> In true Santiago style , of course , the building is an architectural wonder , built by a group of Brazilian architects , and entry is free for all . <p> Palacio de las Bellas Artes <p> The Fine Arts Palace has a great selection of Chilean paintings and sculptures and serves as a solid , if quick , introduction Chile 's art scene . The low admission of only 600 Pesos ( US$1.30 ) is well worth it , and Sundays are free . Art lovers will also enjoy the Contemporary Art Museum , which is located in the same building as the Fine Arts Palace and the Ralli Museum , which holds a comprehensive collection of Latin American artists and pieces by Dali , Miro and Chagall . <p> and more museums : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to be in town on a rainy day , other excellent museums include the interactive Science and Technology museum , the Natural History Museum , the Archeological Museum of Santiago , Museum of Pre-Columbian Art and The Interactivo Mirador . <p> Although these two neighborhoods are just a few metro stops from the Plaza de Armas , most people do not visit here . This is a shame , however , since they are some of the prettiest in Santiago . Barrio Brazil was an upper-class neighborhood in the 1800s , and many of the mansions from that time remain . Barrio Yungay is what felt the most Latin American ' to us , with little colonial houses and cobblestone streets and while some will warn against spending too much time in this lower-income neighborhood , it felt perfectly safe and welcoming during the daytime when we were there and our guide on the free Patrimonial Route walking tour brought us through the neighborhood . We highly recommend this free walking tour , as he also brought us to the famous historic barbershop and French restaurant Peluqueria Francesa for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not have found on our strolls through the area . <p> Las Condes &amp; Providencia <p> Las Condes and Providencia show a completely different face of Santiago , and a trip here is necessary to get an accurate feel of the city . Providencia 's modern skyscrapers have earned it the nicknamed Sanhattan , and although not quite as impressive as Manhattan 's skyline , it is home to the highest tower in South America along with beautiful older buildings as well . Las Condes is almost entirely ultra-modern office buildings and home to the classic Intercontinental hotel covered in ivy trim and the sexy , chic W Hotel just around the corner . <p> If you should ever find yourself feeling creative , bored , thirsty or hungry in Santiago , head to this neighborhood . There is most certainly something happening here " especially on the weekend . Bellavista is a bohemian area with restaurants , bars and clubs , many of which are located on P+o Nono street ( which leads straight to Cerro San Cristobal ) . It is well worth venturing off this main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrio where you 'll see antique mansions , colonial houses and the most , and probably the best , street art in Santiago . Bellavista is also home to Pablo Neruda 's Santiago home La Chascona and definitely check out Patio Bellavista " filled with shops and restaurants , including one of our favorite breakfast/brunch spots Le Fournil ( see below ) . <h> Tours in Santiago- <p> Free Walking Tours <p> Most people spend a few days at most in Santiago on their way north to San Pedro de Atacama or south to Patagonia , so it never feels overrun with tourists . Even so , two companies offer walking tours Free Tour Santiago and Spicy Chile . Free Tour Santiago offers the generic 4-hour walk that covers all the main sights , but we went with Spicy Chile , who offer three different tours that get you off the main trail to explore more of the city . We loved our guide , a 24 year old law student , who was able to really articulate insightful cultural information . <p> Photography Tour <p> FotoRuta has expanded their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can read about our experience here . FotoRuta is a great afternoon experience for photography fans as well as newbies interested in slowing down an taking a closer look at the Lastarria area through a lens . <p> Bike Tour <p> La Bicicleta Verde offers several bike tours in Santiago , so you can see much more in a much shorter time . They offer several tours " Parks &amp; Politics , market tours , night tours and even Wine &amp; Bike tours ! <h> Santiagos culinary delights <p> Vegetarian restaurants <p> Sadly , Santiago is not great for veggies , but what they do have is pretty good . El Huerto in the Providencia neighborhood is our absolute favorite , and we also really liked Quinoa , though this is a bit outside downtown in Vitacura , reachable by the 405 bus ( ask the bus driver to drop you at Luis Pasteur and walk just a bit further in that same direction . ) Skip El Naturista even though it is the oldest vegetarian restaurant in Santiago with three branches throughout the city , the food we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best breakfast <p> We tried several breakfast spots , but hands down , Le Fournil was by far the best . The goal behind this little French bakery ( there are two in Santiago ) is to bring quality European bread to South America , and we can confirm they have done just that ! We loved the Desayuno Le Fournil , which consisted of delicious croissants , homemade baguettes , pastries , fresh jam and butter and a nice , strong coffee . You can also get great lunches and dinners here ( and all come with the delicious bread ! ) . <p> Quick lunch <p> Meat-eaters looking for a quick lunch or snack , the Portal Fern+ndez Concha arcades just south of the Plaza de Armas have dozens of stalls hawking quick completos ' , Chile 's popular style of hot dogs and lomitos ' , typical pork sandwiches . Set meals here run roughly $2.50 including a drink . <p> Lomitos <p> For a much better selection of lomitos , stop in at La Fuente Alemana ( The German Fountain ) , an old-fashioned diner-style restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the cooks in the center preparing the massive sandwiches with roasted pork , avocado , lettuce , tomato , cheese and other ingredients . There are branches around town , but the most central we 've seen is at Avenida Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins 58 just across the river from Barrio Bellavista near the Baquedano metro station . <p> Seafood <p> Mercado Central is the best place for fresh fish . It is clean and always filled with well-heeled locals seated at several fish restaurants right in the market hall . <p> Best pizza <p> The good news in Santiago was for our waistlines " pizza here does n't even begin to compare to our pizza discoveries in Buenos Aires . The only spot that truly won us over was Tiramisu " a bit out of the way in the El Golf neighborhood ( closest metro station is El Golf ) , not far from the W Hotel and worth the trip if you 're seriously in need of pizza . The selection is giant , and you even can get pizza tacos ! <p> Best Chilean bar experience <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central ( Calle Aillavilu 1030 ) is definitely a local drinking experience you should n't miss . This is a gritty cantina packed every night with the entire gamut of Chileans all there to enjoy the bar 's infamous terremotos ( earthquake ) , a dangerous drink made of Pipe+o ( a sweet fermented wine ) , pineapple ice cream and Fernet Branca ( herbal liquor ) . A half liter costs only US$4 and is enough to make you stumble and shaky on your feet ( hence the name ) . If you are in good drinking shape and have somebody to look after you , go for a replica ( aftershock ) . <p> La Piojera also has good Chilean food , especially the chorillanas , a typical Chilean dish of French fries topped with strips of pork , onions and fried eggs " could there be a better drinking/hangover food ? ! <p> The Clinic Bar <p> The Clinic Bar is named after the satirical Chilean newspaper The Clinic ( comparable to The Onion ) and pokes fun at the countrys right wing party in posters all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaper . If you speak Spanish , you can get great insight here for Chiles current political issues , relationship with neighboring countries and also some witty , sharp international- commentary . Along with the political statements you can enjoy typical Chilean dishes and drinks here . <p> Best place to try Chilean wines <p> The BocaNariz bar in the Lastarria neighborhood is the perfect place to sample Chilean wines . They have over one hundred native wines on their menu and also offer several sample options where you can try three different 50ml glasses of wine . Dani tried the Fresh &amp; Fruity white wines and loved them all ! <p> Since Chileans are still enamored with Nescafe Instant Coffee , which is served in most of the traditional restaurants , it can sometimes be hard to find a good cup of espresso , lattes , cappuccinos or just a cafe con leche . Luckily , some coffee connoisseurs decided that Chile needs more Italian-style coffee bars with real coffee and now you ca n't only find good coffee at Starbucks ( although there are several throughout the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For some true latte art and excellent cappuccinos visit the Wonderful Cafe ( they have one branch in the Lastarria neighborhood and one in Las Condes ) , and for organic Guatemalan beans roasted on the spot , head to the Green Roasters Roasting House at Parque Bustamente . We also had excellent espresso at the old-fashioned Cafe de la Barra in Lastarria ; at Santiagos oldest cafe , the historic Confiteria Torres which dates back to 1879 and at the aforementioned Peluqueria Francesa . <h> Some useful tips for your trip to Santiago , Chile <p> Get yourself a BIP card for the metro . You 'll need one for the buses , anyway , which do n't use paper tickets , so you might as well have it for the metro as well . BIPs are 1,400 Pesos ( $2.75 ) and then loaded with as much credit as you 'd like to use the pay as you go system . The entire transportation system is simple to use and the metro stations are beautiful . <p> Lastly , pray for rain ! The best time to head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is after a rainy day , when all the smog gets washed away . That 's when you are most likely to have the beautiful mountain views on all the postcards . 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 12 Comments <p> You certainly have amassed a huge portfolio of things to see and do , and with some amazingly clear skies as well ! I love the fountain at Cerro Santa Lucia and the distinct atmospheres of the different Barrios . And this Coffee with Legs who would have thought ! <p> Santiago is beautiful . Regardless of what many people say . I like staying in Bellas Artes cause is just the best . If you are wondering where to stay in Santiago check out this guys apartments : http : //www.jc-apartments.cl Cheers . RG <p> Hello , Chilean here . Interesting posts . Just wanted to give you a heads up : I think the best street art in the city is in the walls throughout all of the Santa Rosa Axis ( Paralel to the yellow metro line ) . It has some beautiful drawings , so full of meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of our street culture . The thing is , its too dangerous . The micros that go through there go just outside known dangerous neighbourhoods , starting with La Legua , then San Gregorio , and Santo Tom+s. 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107142985 @2542985/ <h> Life and death on a road trip through the Quebrada de Humahuaca <p> Light snoring buzzed out from the backseat . Hernan , the hitchhiker we picked up earlier , had been nodding off and on for the last twenty minutes , but Dani and I were still wide awake , our eyes fixated on the landscape twisting and turning before us through the windshield of our little white rental car . Little did we know that one of the main characters in our road trip would die <p> But I 'm getting ahead of myself that did n't happen until Day 2 . We played like children together on the first day of the trip , which is why Hernan was passed out in back . <p> Road-tripping through northern Argentina 's Quebrada de Humahuaca , a narrow 155km-long valley , is by far the best way to experience this technicolor mountainous landscape . A major part of the Camino Inca , or famous Inca Trail , the Quebrada was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its cultural and historical role in this area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designation could come from an effort to preserve its improbable forms and colors that inspire a feeling of magic and infinite possibility . This was one of the first areas of Argentina explored by the Spanish on their way from the Altiplano to the warmer climates of Salta , Cordoba and on to Buenos Aires . <p> Normally we would never pick up a hitchhiker , but fate stepped in to force us to meet this particular Argentine , who was on his first day of an infinite journey in the opposite direction . He had just flown up from Buenos Aires to Salta that morning and our paths crossed at the highway turn off to our first stop , the village of Pumamarca . After suddenly being thrust into a day of hitchhiking ourselves in Patagonia ( read about how we hitchhiked to the end of the world ) just the month before , we felt we had to re-pay our debt , and Hernans big smile made us pull over that day . <p> In the car , he shared his story and his goal of making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his guitar , and his eyes lit up when we shared our story of traveling for three years straight confirmation that his own dream to live freely was n't so crazy after all . <p> We separated for a bit once we arrived in Purmamarca ; Hernan checked into his hostel and we wandered around the center , bargaining for a few little textiles in the market before meeting back up to hike around the Sierra de Siete Colores , or seven-colored hill . If , as a kid , you ever colored sand with chalk and then filled it in , layer by layer , into a glass jar , you 'll have a good idea of what this hike looked like . <p> Together we ate empanadas at a wooden table in a dark , dusty restaurant and drove up over the mountains out to the salt flats . It may have seemed like a favor to pick him up , but we put Hernan to work . He became our own personal photographer as we jumped and karate-chopped through the air , hopped inside our hats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive expanses of bright white salt as far as the eye can see . <p> These salt flats are actually minuscule compared to Bolivia 's famous Salar de Uyuni just 150km over the border . However , it was also so beautiful that we did n't mind driving right through it all again just two days later on the road that leads to the highest desert in the world and our next stop : Chile 's Atacama Desert . <p> As the slanted sun shot diagonal rays across the afternoon sky , we made our way back over the mountains , woke up our new friend , dropped him back at his hostel and headed on to spend the night in nearby town of Tilcara . <p> Just 85km from Jujuy , Tilcara is a compact grid of colonial style buildings , cobblestone streets and a dusty indigenous feel . Time in Tilcara was short since we headed off first thing the next morning to continue the trip , but we managed to have a deliciously typical dinner of quinoa and empanadas and feed two stray dogs a meal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town that sits 2,500m above sea level . <p> Near Tilcara is the Purcara de Tilcara , partially reconstructed pre-Inca ruins , but we opted to stop instead the next morning in Uquaia , a roadside village famous for its 17th century church for a very interesting reason . The paintings lining the walls inside feature several saints , each wielding rather large weapons . When we first arrived , a tour bus engine was loudly idling but within minutes the entire busload of Argentine seniors shuffled out into the makeshift market area in front and we had the church to ourselves to ponder this oddity before leaving for Humahuaca . <p> On the road to Humahuaca , we must have stopped 50 times for photos , most often when guanacos ( cousins to llamas and alpacas ) gracefully galloped across the highway , winking their way up into the Andes foothills on the other side . In the flatter valley areas , the earth is a coppery orange-red , dotted with every imaginable shade of green . The mountains that jut up out of them are every color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even blues and deep purples . Around each turn comes a new design as if painted by an abstract landscape artist . <p> Humahuaca is much more like Bolivia than Buenos Aires from the indigenous residents to the piles of bright textiles for sale up and down the streets . Humahuaca feels like Bolivia today or Santa Fe , New Mexico two hundred years ago , but it most certainly feels unlike anywhere else in Argentina . Because we only half a day here , we shopped up and down the streets , climbed up the- Monumento de la Independencia and had piles of vegetarian empanadas . We made sure to walk the length of the local market as well before heading back to the car . <p> And then , it happened . Our little white rental was dead . <p> We turned the key over and over , pumped the brakes , but it sat , motionless , a hunk of metal on a side street just off the market street . One of us ( who has chosen not to be named and blamed ) may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Without wanting to draw unwanted attention to being two gringas in need , I casually asked a couple of taxi drivers nearby if they could give us a jump . They laughed . No one will help you here . Not for free . We are poor here , this is not Buenos Aires. They shrugged and went back to their conversation , not even allowing me to elaborate , bargain or enlist their help . I got the feeling that it had nothing to do with the money . They just could n't have cared less . <p> Eventually I got it out of one taxista that a garage was right up the street , but it was closed . Until when , I asked , to which I received an apathetic shoulder shrug for a reply . <p> After just a few attempts of flagging down someone to help us push the car up the road to the mechanic , an SUV with two older couples stopped , the husbands got out and helped us push the car to the garage . 30 minutes and 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major emergency was quickly solved and we were back on the road for our three-hour drive back to Jujuy . <p> On the way back it was just the two of us , no new friends , no hitchhikers .

The sun was setting ; golden light hit the back of the mountains with views , colors and shadows entirely different to our morning drives in the opposite direction . Back in Jujuy , the thumping beats of the citys congested streets snapped us out of our dream state , but much of the magic of those two days has stuck with us ever since . <h> Travel tips for a Quebrada de Humahuaca road trip <p> Rent a car in Jujuy or Salta . We rented from Hertz for 717 pesos / US $140 for two days . <p> Plan in at least 2-3 nights and stay in Purmamarca , Tilcara and Humahuaca in order to give you more time to soak up the scenery . <p> If you do n't want to rent a car , you can take a bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tours you can book to visit the sites photo stops and spontaneity are reduced , however . <p> The quality of the roads is good , and easy to drive .

I am heading to Argentina in about a week but unfortunately I have only 3 weeks to explore the parts I do n't  know yet and visit old friends in C+rdoba so Humahuaca is not on the list yet but I 'm sure I 'll make it one day = I love Argentina and I guess I 'll be coming back several times . <p> Thanks Stef Humahuaca was a relatively last minute decision because of our time in Salta and looking at how we could get to Chile , etc .

But I am very sure you 'll get there one day Argentina is just so big , there is so much to see . <p> I wonder if part of the reason your car battery was drained was due to the salt flats . When we visited the ones in Bolivia , our driver told us they have to be careful how long they leave their vehicles inactive sitting on the salt , because as it contains lithium , it can somehow ( do n't  ask me how ) drain the battery ? <p> Anyway , sounds like a fun adventure ! I was pleasantly surprised at the range and availability of vegetarian empanadas in this region ; such a nice change from just finding chicken or meat ! <p> That 's interesting about the lithium , and I also do n't  understand how that would work ! But let 's make ourselves feel better that it was n't ONLY because we may have left the lights on for an hour = Oh , and with the empanadas awesome , right ? I mean I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such wonderful photos and I 'm glad to hear you put Hernan to good use . I too had grave concerns for his life for a moment there !

The sun has been shining every afternoon , so were working on our tans here though the waters still too cold to swim in . Then we have one more beach stop further north in Iquique before heading to one of our favorite place ( if not our favorite ) in Chile : the Atacama Desert on our way to Bolivia . 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

This helps us get an idea of how the city is laid out , its actual size , and most importantly creates a huge respect for the city , its skyline and the buzz of the people living and working on its streets . <p> Before arriving at one of our hotels in Singapore , we had already researched the best places to see Singapore from above , and knew that this Asian metropolis has a wide variety of these vantage points. - Read on to find out the best ways to take in Singapores skyline : <h> The Mount Faber Cable Car <p> The Singapore cable car connects Mount Faber with Sentosa Island , with a short stop at Harborfront . Start at Mount Faber " the views from the mountain are fantastic ! Watch cars drive along the curvy road hugging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to count dozens of freighter ships waiting to be allowed into the harbor.Spot some of Singapore 's creative architecture in the new apartment buildings near the ocean , and of course one of Singapores main tourist destinations , Sentosa Island , where you land on your final approach . <p> The ride is short . It takes about 10 minutes to cover the roughly 1,000 meters ( 3,280ft ) between Mt Faber and the island . To spend more time in the sky , opt for Sky Dining , which will give you the privacy of your own cabin and a romantic fine dining experience during the sun set ( S$168 per couple for a 3-course dinner , S$218 for four courses . ) <h> Tiger Sky Tower- on Sentosa Island <p> Once you have arrived at Sentona Island , hang out for a while . Tour the free cable car museum for an interesting history of how the cable car has improved over the years . Make no mistake Sentosa Island is essentially a resort , with two golf courses , two 5-star resorts , a Universal theme park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you can spend a day on the beach here facing the ocean and blissfully ignore the busy city behind you . <p> Sentosa Island is also the best place to look at Singapore from outside of the city , by taking a trip up the Tiger Sky Tower . Not only does this offer views over Singapore 's skyline , but you can see everything on Sentosa Island and the small islands beyond . On clear days you can even see Malaysia and Indonesia. - The Tower is actually a big round cabin that ascends the column of the tower slowly while turning , providing 360 degree views . <p> If you do n't want to use the cable car , you can also walk to Sentosa Island from Harbourfront ( the walk takes about 30 minutes ) or take the monorail . <h> The Singapore Flyer <p> If you like Ferris wheels , you will love The Singapore Flyer ! The tallest in the world , the Singapore Flyer towers over the city at 165 meters tall , a full 30 meters higher than the London Eye. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 minute vertical tour of the city . We must have shot 200 pictures while in our massive pod . <p> The wheel is located on the Marina Promenade on the South Eastern side of the Marina Bay , in walkable distance from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel .

Those of you on your way to Singapore now can visit what we later found out is a $1 billion construction of gardens , which look like they are straight out of Alice in Wonderland . Actually a conservatory with 226,000 plants and flowers from all around the globe , it is also home to 18 Supertrees ' which serve as vertical gardens , collecting rain water and generating solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatory . <p> The Singapore Flyer also offers a longer time on board with a truly special dinner- the worlds first full butler sky dining . You will spend an hour rotating twice while enjoying a world-class 4-course meal in a private gondola . <h> Marina Bay Sands Skydeck <p> It is a strangely beautiful architectural masterpiece and we just loved staring out at the Marina Bay Sands from everywhere else in Singapore.But some of the absolute best views of the city are to be had on top of this building itself from the Skydeck. - The 340m-long SkyPark that tops the three towers is home to the highest infinity swimming pool in the world , and the world 's largest cantilevered platform ( which is the 67 meters worth of overhang you see that makes the Skydeck almost look like ship sailing in the air . <p> There are several ways how you can access the Skypark . You can stay at the hotel , which in addition to views , gives you immediate acess to the infinity pool as well . There is an observation deck , but- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why not grab a drink at the Sky on 57th restaurant instead . Sure , a glass of the house red costs $20 , and a Singapore Fling is $18 , but its the same price as the Observation Deck and there is nothing quite like having a drink at sunset looking out over the Marina Bay <p> Plus , keep an eye out for celebrities while you 're here . The rich and famous love this hotel just as much as everybody else and Marina Bay Sands has hosted a long list of famous guests . <p> Highest point : 191 metres ( 626 meters ) <p> Price : S$20 for the skydeck , or the price of a drink at one of the rooftop restaurants ( starting at around S$8 , or $18 " S$20 for a cocktail or glass of wine ) 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 26 Comments <p> When I was in Singapore a few years ago , the Marina Bay Sands building was under construction and I was wondering how it would turn out .

I left home with a tiny MP3 player , happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an iPod Touch , only a little bit larger , was not only a gadget to play music on , but allowed me to download podcasts , take photos , scribble down notes , access maps even when I was offline , connect to the internet wherever there was Wi-Fi , and had enough room for a myriad of apps to keep me entertained on long bus and train rides . <p> I ca n't even imagine my life without these things anymore , and this past year , I 've added two little electronic gadgets with a large impact on my travels : <h> Portable charger <p> When I first picked it up , I could n't understand how I survived so many years on the road without this tiny device because my batteries were always about to die . With this charger you can charge any USB-powered device : iPod , iPhone , Kindle and even some cameras . Since I picked it up , I have n't had the problem of my phone ran out of battery anymore . I even added a second charger recently which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gadget ! <h> Flash drives with the capacity of a hard drive <p> I remember how amazed I was by my first USB stick " which held 128 MB basically nothing ! This year , I picked up a USB stick that holds 128 GB " what a difference ! I love how modern technology is able to make everything smaller and smaller these days ! For a traveler , that 's perfect . A USB-sized hard drive does n't only hold thousands of the photos I take ( and other things I want to back up ) without taking up as much space ( and weight ) as an external hard drive , but it 's also easier to hide . And not only do these devices get smaller " but they also get cheaper . <p> As for non-electronics , my favorite additions to my travel gear have been : <h> New headphones <p> This might be not important to some people , but I will always choose a company with a strong focus on social responsibility over a company that is all about profits . LSTN is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every pair of headphones sold , LSTN helps restore hearing to a person in need through the Starkey Hearing Foundation . <p> But let 's talk about the headphones themselves , which are one of the few rare headphones that are made of wood . If you are a music lover then you 've probably heard of the acoustic benefits of wood housing . The sound quality of the headphones is excellent , and even though they do n't claim to be noise-cancelling , I 've successfully cancelled out traffic noise , cafe surroundings and other noises in public spaces , all while not disturbing strangers with the latest Taylor Swift CD , since the headphones do n't let any noise through until a very high volume . <p> The headphones are very light , which I as a full-time traveler truly appreciate , and look divine with the wood housing ( you can choose between ebony , cherry and beech , by the way ) . At $99 , they are also very reasonably priced . You can buy them on Amazon.com . <h> Go-Go-Goloshes <p> These foldable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my trip to Niagara Falls ! While I could n't just slip them over my flip flops ( supposedly you can just wear them over your shoes ) , they were a life saver on many occasions , when a sudden downpour or more like : heavy rains relieved New York City from the summer heat and humidity for a while . I just took of my flip flops and changed into my go-gos and was good to go ! They are so light and small that I did n't  even feel them in my tote . When I went on my trip to Niagara Falls , they proved useful once again when I got soaked on the Hurricane Deck . <h> - A tote bag <p> I do n't  know why I did n't  think of picking up one earlier but tote bags seem to be perfect to travel with ! While I usually use my backpack when I head out to explore a place , sometimes it just feels a bit out of place . A tote bag is a little more stylish , yet sturdy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your luggage and it does n't  take up any room . You can just roll it up or put it flat on the bottom of your bag perfect ! <p> Ohhh Dani ! I love revisiting this list now that I 've traveled long-term . These items are exactly right . That portable charger is still such a great idea . I had a little solar charger along for my trip which was great in a bind . But that one seems like it might be a little more powerful . Will have to add it to my setup for next time ! Hope you 're enjoying the heck out of Costa Rica ! = <p> Now you made me go back to that post and look at all the things I listed back then = I had two portable chargers , now I 'm down to one and its not enough .. for some reason I 'm always running out of battery = It charges my Kindle too amazing ! <p> P.S.

It was her first time in the country , and it was my job to give her the best introduction to Mexico possible " a mix of culture , food , and scenery . <p> I did n't have to think long about where I 'd take her : the Yucatan Peninsula/the state of Quintana Roo . This part of Mexico , a peninsula in the southeast that stretches along the Caribbean coastline all the way down to Belize , is my favorite part of the country , a region that I could return to over and over again.I knew I could give her a great taste of Mexico here , with abundant Mayan culture at historic sites like Chichen Itza , Tulum and Uxmal ; beautiful Spanish-colonial towns like Valladolid , Campeche and Izamal ; dreamy beaches in Playa del Carmen , Tulum and Mahahual ; dozens of cenotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming with turtles and flamingo watching for wildlife , and plenty of taco stops along the way.Once I started to map out my dream road trip in detail , breaking it down day by day , I realized that I would n't be able to fit in all the places I ideally wanted to visit . This was the route for our week-long road trip:If you have more time than we did ( ten days ) , I recommend you take this slightly longer route , which includes the Yellow Town of Izamal and Las Coloradas , the Pink Lakes near Rio Lagartos ( flamingos included , if you 're visiting at the right time of year ! ) . You could end your trip in Isla Holbox and swim with whale sharks ( July until October ) or on Isla Mujeres like we did.If you 're wondering why I did n't include Merida in the second option , which is just a short drive from Izamal , it is because I was n't too fussed about Merida when I visited a few years back , but that 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree and definitely include Merida . <p> But back to our route .

We picked up our US$9 per day rental car at the airport in Cancun and headed straight south towards Playa del Carmen . On the way , just off the main highway to Playa , sits Puerto Morelos . Even though it 's far from not touristy " there are some fancy condo buildings further down the beach " in its core , it is still pretty much untouched by the mass tourism you find in Playa or Cancun . Fisherman sell their catch right on the beach , which is lined with colorful little fishing boats .

Cenotes are underwater sinkholes or underground caverns which result from the collapse of limestone bedrock that exposes groundwater underneath . They come in different shapes and forms , some are covered , others are open , and there are over 7,000 of them scattered all over the Yucatan peninsula.In fact , they are unique to this part of Mexico and belong to an extensive underground network of rivers and caves , many of which remain unexplored . Those that are explored have one thing in common : they all have crystal clear turquoise water and often they have a large underwater cave system which you can not see from the usually round , open cenote entrance . In short : they are perfect for snorkeling and diving and are a must-visit on a trip to the Yucatan.I tried to fit as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce Miss G to several kinds of sinkholes : covered ones , underground ones , and open ones , and our first one was going to be an open cenote south of Playa named Jardin del Eden , Garden Of Eden.Jardin del Eden is aptly named in my opinion , because this open cenote is surrounded by lush green plants and trees , and you can see all the way down to the bottom of it . This is one of the bigger cenotes I 've seen , and what you see from above is n't even everything there is : we kept seeing groups of divers peek out of the water every now and again , which made me wonder how big the underwater cave system was.Our second day in Playa was spent right in town , because this beach deserved some time , too:I have to admit that I am not the biggest fan of Playa itself though , simply because it is just so Americanized and tourist-focused , but I know that other people like it . Fifth Avenue , the main drag that runs parallel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souvenir shops and restaurants , many of which do n't even serve Mexican food , but European or North American fare at U.S. prices . I do n't mind it for a stroll , but we did n't spend much time in Playa itself.Our hotel , the Grand Hyatt Resort , was right on the best stretch of the beach , Playa Mamita , and I have to admit that I found it hard to leave my sun lounger by the gorgeous infinity pool . Can you blame me ? I know that other travelers spend a week or longer in Playa , but some of my favorite places along the coast , the Riviera Maya , are actually further south . Our next stop was one of them : Akumal.This small beach town is located about 30 minutes south of PdC , or 25 minutes north of Tulum . Once a hidden gem , the secret is out now . During previous visits , I 'd never seen the beach as busy as this time around , and that 's for one very good reason : there are sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and you can swim with them . While years ago , you 'd see only a few individual tourists floating face-down in the water turtle watching , this time around there were entire tour groups in the water , easily recognizable by their bright yellow , orange or red life jackets . As soon as we walked up to the beach , we were approached by a bunch of guys trying to sell us a pricey snorkel tour . Since when do we have to pay for this ? , I wondered . For all I knew , access to the beach was free . So be careful : Do n't  let anyone convince you you need to join a tour . No need for that ! All you need is a snorkel and a mask.I was n't surprised when I later read in an article that Akumal is struggling to maintain sustainable tourism due to the increased number of tourists , and that the turtles are showing signs of stress due to the high number of humans in the water.Apologies for the bad quality of these pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the turtles . Make sure to bring a good underwater camera and , extra pro tip , a disposable camera does n't  qualify as such . 129333 @qwx989333 <p> I was initially tempted to rent a car via RentalCars.com , an Expedia-owned car rental company I often use in the US but these prices seemed too good even for me ( being a cheap ass ! ) : <p> Instead , I opted for the slightly pricier Priceline.com , where cars start at US$4 per day . I was skeptic but willing to give it a try , thinking that even with additional fees and taxes it could n't add up to more than $20 a day . And sure enough , there are some additional charges in Mexico that are not covered by credit card car insurance ( most credit card companies offer up to 14 days coverage overseas before you go on your trip , check what kind of coverage is included in your credit card . Nerdwallet has a good overview of all credit cards and what kind of insurance they cover . ) <p> Note:All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal liability insurance ( sometimes called third-party liability insurance ) . They do not accept personal liability insurance through U.S. credit cards . However , they are by law required to include this fee in the rental price , so do n't  let them fool you and tell you it has to be added . <p> Some car rental companies will try to sell you a so-called supplemental liability insurance on top of that . It is not mandatory , but at only around $13 a day it is worth considering . <p> A comprehensive article on everything you need to know about renting a car in Mexico can be found here.Third-party liability insurance can also be purchased through an independent insurance provider , by the way . I 've done that several times ( through iCarHireInsurance , a UK-based company ) , including this trip and their daily rates are about half of what you pay at the rental car counter . I paid around GBP6 per day . If you decide to go for this option , there are two things to note : 1 ) You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy number at the counter . 2 ) Not all countries accept third-party insurances , so check beforehand if your destination does accept it . <p> Important : Another additional and not insignificant charge to your credit card will be a security deposit which you 'll get back when you return the car . The amount of this will depend on the total of your rental I was charged around $1,500 but other companies charge more ( US$3,000 are not uncommon ) . The amount was returned to my credit card upon returning the car . <p> Road conditions : The roads in the Yucatan are in very good condition , especially the 4-lane road between Cancun and Tulum and the fast route between Cancun and Valladolid . We found ourselves on unpaved roads occasionally ( usually to get to a cenote ) but nothing our economy car would n't have been able to handle . Be careful with the topes though , horrid speed bumps which you 'll encounter frequently . <p> Gas stations:There are plenty of gas stations all over the Yucatan , but note that there are still gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Although you would think that applying for a visa for one country in another country when you are not from either country might be complicated , the fact is that the process itself is both straight-forward and common . The Chiang Mai Indian Consulate is not usually busy . Just take off your shoes and walk inside .

That 's it . <p> Again , you will have three months from the date of visa issue , not the date you enter the country .

Even though my plan conflicted with the healthy eating regime Jess has us on , I was determined to try them all. - One by one we crossed every single pizza joint off my list and stopped into random pizza restaurants as well ( we also ate lots of salad , I swear ) . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian immigrants : even though there is a pizza place on every corner , the quality varies dramatically , from heavenly to forgettable and from mediocre to downright disgusting . <p> Although you might not be as obsessed as we are about pizza , we do n't  just want you to sit down at a red-checkered table cloth and hope for the best . In the name of research , we were more than happy to sample over 15 different well-known pizza places in six weeks in order to develop our expert opinion on this to bring the following pizza recommendations to you ! <h> Best Argentine-style Pizza <p> Somewhere between Italian and Chicago deep dish , Argentine pizza is thick , very cheesy and usually light on the sauce . Rather than being baked with the cheese , toppings are piled high on top just before being served and this freshness nicely balances the thick , gooey layer of cheese . <p> El Cuartito <p> Coincidentally a five minute walk from our apartment , El Cuartito was our first stop on our pizza pilgrimage . This Buenos Aires institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this- For 91 Days article . Established in 1934 , El Cuartito still has all its old-fashioned charm , its walls plastered in sports posters and football on TV . Even though there is almost always a line out the door during main dinner hours , we rarely saw any other tourists here ( and yes , we ate here more than onceor twice ) . Our recommendation : The Napolitana was our favorite type of Argentine pizza overall , and El Cuartito does it best . A Napolitana has mozzarella cheese called muzza in Argentina , thickly sliced fresh tomato slices and whole , pitted olives strewn- generously- on top . <p> Address : Talcahuano 937 , Buenos Aires <p> Runner up : Los Inmortales <p> For Jess , Los Inmortales is at an exact tie with El Cuartito , so it is only just slightly a runner up in the Argentine pizza category . A chain with five branches in Buenos Aires , Los Inmortales pizzas come with loads of vegetables on top and have less cheese than El Cuartito ( though only slightly ! ) . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the legendary El G++err+n ( mentioned below ) . <p> One great thing about pizza in Buenos Aires is that you can always split toppings half and half , paying the full price for the more expensive of the two . At Los Inmortales we split the Napolitana with one topped with hardboiled egg ( see the interesting picture below ) , and one split with half covered in fresh Rucola and the other topped with loads of freshly chopped basil . The best thing about Los Inmortales is the quality of the dough . We noticed this right away with the basket of bread that comes before the meal , in the pizza crust itself , but the dough was able to shine the most in the empanadas . Even though we were ridiculously full , we still managed to fit in a Caprese and a Roquefort empanada , both of which were easily some of the best we had in the city . <p> El- G++err+n is another Buenos Aires institution and was packed every time we went there . The eggs on our spinach and egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for it . Most pizza places in Buenos Aires have sections where people just grab a slice or two and eat them standing up , and El G++err+n was definitely one of the most popular places to do that . This is faster , easier and cheaper , since you do n't  pay service charges , so- we returned to give the place another chance . We grabbed a few slices and as well as an order of- faina , which is very good at El- G++err+n . Shaped like a slice of pizza but thinner , Faina ( pictured below ) is made of a chickpea batter and meant to be placed right on top of your pizza slice , essentially creating a pizza sandwich. - Even though faina apparently originated in Italy , we have never seen it there . After trying Faina a few times , we concluded that while it tastes good , it does n't  add to the pizza experience and takes up room meant for more pizza in your belly ! <p> Address : Avenida Corrientes 1368 , Buenos Aires <h> Best Italian-style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of pizza over the years , the thin crust Italian style pizza is still found here often . <p> Filo <p> Filo , located in the Microcentro business district , was our absolute favorite pizza place in Buenos Aires . Even though indulging in cheesy Argentina pizzas and empanadas is a treat , we both prefer Italian-style thin-crust pizza and Filos stone over pizzas were seriously addictive . Their fresh rucola and shaved parmesan pizza was by far the best pizza we had in the city . Although the service here is seriously lacking , the stylish restaurant also adds to the overall experience , with big red American diner style booths in the back , an rather interesting mannequin at the entrance and a live DJ ( quietly ) spinning electro house all night long . The prices here are higher than the local Argentine spots , with an average meal for two , with one alcohol beverage each ( because they do n't  come back to serve you after your pizza comes ) ran us $30-$35 on our visits here . <p> Address : San Mart+n 975 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Siamo nel Forno in Palermo Hollywood is often mentioned as a premier spot for Italian style pizza . The intimate- restaurant is set in the chic Palermo neighborhood and its prices are accordingly high . Their pizza of the day was a shocking AR$90 ( U.S. $18 ) but the high quality ingredients , rich homemade sauce and light , crispy dough are well worth the splurge. - Two pizzas plus drinks would have made our total bill roughly $50 . <p> Address : Costa Rica 5886 , Buenos Aires <h> Best Dessert Pizza <p> Bakano <p> The Argentine style pizza at this affordable pizza joint was delicious ( we had our standard , go-to Napolitana here ) , but no matter what you order you must save room for dessert because Bakano makes dessert pizzas . <p> The idea is as simple as it is genius . They take the pizza dough and create sweet pizzas like dulce de leche topped wtih vailla ice cream , or Nutella pizza topped with ice cream , or brownie banana chocolate pizza , or one with fruit and cream and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pizza <p> Kentucky Pizza <p> Though it might sound questionable considering there is a distinct lack of Italian influence in the state of the same name , Kentucky Pizza has become a bit of an institution in Buenos Aires , albeit of a cheap , post-party nature . This chain can be found throughout Buenos Aires , with most branches in and around Palermo . It is not the best pizza we had , but it is by far the best value for the quality . You can order full pizzas or eat by the slice , and Kentucky Pizza has great slice + drink meals , which includes beer or wine as an option . After having read about the sizes of their wine glasses I ordered the deal that included two slices of pizza and a glass of wine for AR$23 ( US$4.70 ) , and left happily fully and a little bit tipsy ! <p> Although the empanadas also looked great at Kentucky , we filled up on pizza and faina both times and never got around to trying them . Now that you know where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's time to think about where you 'll be staying on your visit to Argentina .

I just returned from a year in China , and one thing I can bring back from there is that the Chinese have no idea how to make an edible pizza ! <p> Some of the worst pizzas I 've ever had in my life were in Ecuador , so I 'm glad to hear they 've got a thumping pizza scene somewhere on the continent .

We almost gave up pizza entirely for the 13 months we spent in that region . The only other place we had a ( superb ! ) dessert pizza was Nicaragua though I 'd go back to Granada just to eat at that pizzeria again = <p> You know we are just as pizza obsessed as you but despite trying many different pizzas in BA we just did n't  find any we really loved . They were all too cheesy and salty for us . We were rather disappointed considering our high hopes given the Italian influence . <p> I do n't  think I had any pizza when I went to Buenos Aires I guess another reason to go back ! Have you ever eaten pizza in Peru ? I loved the pizza in Cusco , especially the spicy-tangy sauce they gave me to put on top of the pizza . <p> Alexa , what a shame that you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great reason to go back = And we are en route to Peru , so reading about this pizza with a spicy sauce gets me excited to get there ! = <p> Interesting post . I tried my hardest to like pizza in Argentina , but never found a single place in BA , Cordoba , or Mendoza that I liked . Well , there was one place in Mendoza where it was edible . I am a traditionalist , with a love affair for Italian pizza , but also grew up outside of NYC , so I have high standards . The Italian style pizzas you showed looked pretty decent , but I was not a fan of that thick " crust " , gooey cheese , and olives . I would , however , love to track down one of those dolce de leche dessert pizzas that looked tasty ! <p> Hi Amber , so sorry to hear that you did n't  find any pizza that you loved in BA ! We have to admit we did a lot of research before we got there and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our short list , the pizza was usually disgusting .

While you can sip 50 cent beers on a beach in Cambodia or drink $3 liquor buckets in Thailand , a Singapore Sling sets you back $20 , or even more if you want to try the classic version at the Raffles Hotel . <p> But that does n't mean Singapore ca n't be visited on the cheap with some smart planning . We loved our quick visit to Singapore , which made for the most cosmopolitan experience in South East Asia . Luckily , it is not expensive to get to Singapore at all , as it is a major transport hub in South East Asia with daily connections to North America , Europe and Australia . <p> Read on for the tips we used for our budget-friendly weekend escape in Singapore : <h> Find deals on accommodation <p> Hotels in Singapore are easily the biggest chunk of anyones budget while in town .

All the big hotels usually have a promotion which can save you up to 70 per cent of the original price . This is one city where the best dorms can run the same price as quality hotels , which is why research and reservations are key to saving on accommodation . <h> Locate the best restaurant promotions <p> Singapore is filled with hawker centers , popular food halls that offer a variety of food stalls where you can try some of the best specialties that the country has to offer , with prices rarely above $4 for a delicious meal . <p> However , Singapore is a foodie city and it would be a shame to miss out on top of the line restaurants and exciting cuisines while in town . We signed up to deals websites before our trip to find discounts on hotspots we wanted to try . Check out the restaurant and bar deals on restaurant deal websites , where you can find incredible promotions for some of the city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the lunch buffet for $28 at Windows on the Park on Orchard Street , which is double the price without the coupon , or the 4-Course French Degustation Menu at The Tastings Room in Marina Square for the same price , which is a true bargain . <h> Plan out your activities in advance <p> No matter what your interest is , Singapore has something for every travel style . You can visit the theater , art galleries and a number of world-class museums , and even if you do n't  have cash to spare , we loved joining the throngs of shoppers on Orchard Road , a wide boulevard lined with over 20 malls offering everything from high street brands to luxurious designer labels . One of the best things about the city is how many free things there are to do in Singapore. - <p> For paid attractions , its worth checking for promotions on websites like Groupon , where we found deals on admission to the Flower Dome , the Cloud Forest , Underwater World and the Dolphin Lagoon for only $35 , or a combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Bay for $37 instead of the normal price of $53 . Other deals include the Hop On Hop Off Bus Tour plus a river cruise for only $35 , which is a great way to take in this majestic city ! <p> Singapore does luxury best , but there is no reason to miss out on the wellness side of things if you 're on a budget , either . There are deals to be had for Spa &amp; Wellness - activities here , too , like full body massages for $25 or mani pedis for $20 . <h> Things you should n't miss in Singapore : <p> The views from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel Rooftop. - The vistas over the city from up there are breathtaking , especially at sunset . You can either pay $20 for the observation deck or pay the same $20 for a drink at the Sky on 57th restaurant .

If you are not a beach person but are looking for some peace and quiet , make sure not to miss the Botanical Gardens . We absolutely loved it here , surrounded by a massive selection of exotic flowers , including a rain forest , a ginger garden and an orchid garden . The best thing : they are free ! <p> The Marina Bay Visual Arts Trail . A stroll around Marina Bay should not be missed , and the Visual Arts Trail features a number of outstanding sculptures , including a piece by Roy Liechtenstein .

Your recommendation for Chinatown is great too , as it provides a cultural perspective into Singapore . For cultural experience , I 'd personally add Little India and Bugis into the mix as well . <p> Visiting Singapore for the 3rd time with my family have been to most of the tourist spots and activities Can anyone help me in knowing what 's next Had been to SING just 2 years back .

In Boracay the cheapest private room I could find ( in high season ) was PHP1,250/ US$28.32 , a dorm room in Boracay was PHP600/ US$13.60 . Dorms in a central location in Manila are also around PHP600 , slightly cheaper in older hostels or hostels that are n't located as conveniently as the hostels in Makati , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel in Makati ( Tune Hotels work similar to budget airlines : the earlier you book , the cheaper the room rate ) .

The cheapest private room I found in El Nido was PHP600 /US$13.60 , dorms in a centrally located hostel were also around PHP600 . <p> Average per night : PHP500 /US$11.33 <p> I do n't  have a single picture of a place I stayed at because the accommodation in the Philippines is frankly nothing to write home , or to blog about ! <h> Transportation <p> My flights were all around US$100 but you can easily get better deals than I did if you book in advance " much better deals , for as little as US$15 during flight sales , or around $30 if you book in advance . I share more tips on finding the cheapest flights below . <p> The other main transportation you 'll take will be ferries , which range from PHP25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for longer rides ( 3-4 hours ) . On top of that , you 'll always pay a terminal fee ( see below ) . The most expensive ferry fee I paid was PHP965 /US$22 , which included the ferry ticket , a surcharge for my luggage and the terminal fee . <p> Other modes of transport you 'll encounter are buses , which range from very basic city buses to more comfortable long-distance coaches . A 4-hour bus ride on Cebu Island cost me PHP175 /US$3.95 , a night bus from Manila is PHP470-530 / US$10.66-11.90 . The 2-hr bus ride I took on Bohol was PHP30 /US$0.68.Motorbike rentals start at PHP250 /US$5.66 per day . <p> A taxi from Manila airport into town was PHP200 /US$4.50 , a shared tricycle from the ferry port in Boracay to White Beach was PHP20 /US$0.45 just to give you an idea of what to expect . <p> Average : PHP1,780 /US$40 for a flight , PHP210 /US$4.70 for a ferry ride . <p> Island Hopping Tours in El Nido : A full day of snorkeling , a lunch buffet and island hopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost me around PHP300 /US$6.75 , up to PHP500/ US$11.25 for a nicer meal .

In other places , I usually paid around PHP200 /US$4.50 for a cheaper vegetarian meal , dishes with fish or meat were usually around PHP300 /US$6.75 . I usually paid PHP190 /US$4.30 for breakfast , but in touristy areas ( El Nido or Boracay ) up to PHP350 /US$8 and a fancy breakfast in Manila set me back at PHP650 /US$14.72. - A big bottle of water averaged PHP30-50 /US$0.68-1.13 , a decent cup of coffee was between PHP100-125 /US$2.30-2.83 ; a fresh fruit shake cost around PHP110 /US$250 . <p> Average : PHP200 /US$4.50 for a vegetarian meal &amp; PHP300/US$6.75 for a non-vegetarian meal . <h> Entertainment <p> Let 's start with alcoholic drinks : Beer is usually between PHP40-60 /US$0.89-1.35 , in some pricier places PHP80 /US$1.79 .

In the Philippines , however , I had to show my ticket and prove that I 'd be leaving again . Luckily I bought a ticket from Manila to Bangkok the night before I boarded my flight to the Philippines , otherwise I would n't have been allowed on the plane . <h> Plan in advance <p> My main recommendation is to plan your trip as detailed as possible " especially the flights you 'll be taking . Since you 're only issued a 28-day tourist visa in the Philippines anyway , you should know your dates for at least some of your flights already . <h> Factor in terminal fees <p> When you take a ferry or a plane , you usually have to pay a terminal fee in the Philippines . These vary considerably " from PHP100 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as little as PHP14 ( US$0.32 ) at ferry ports . While they are not outrageously high , it is still an expense you need to factor in . Sometimes they are included in the ferry ticket , other times they are not . When leaving the Philippines , I paid the highest terminal fee : PHP550 ( US$12 ) at Manila Airport . <h> Compare airlines <p> I found that in the Philippines , it could make a huge difference which airline you took . Unfortunately , Cebu Pacific , the least reliable airline , often had the cheapest tickets ( none of my flights was ever cancelled , but I was usually delayed " other travelers were less lucky ) , but sometimes PAL Express or AirAsia had better ticket prices . It pays off to compare prices on each individual website instead of using flight comparison websites because they usually do n't include all of the budget airlines and/or do n't factor in extra charges for luggage . <h> Avoid high season if possible <p> This one might be obvious , but especially destinations like Boracay or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors from other Asian countries , fill up like crazy during local Holidays such as Holy Week or Christmas , and prices for accommodation sky rocket . <p> Planning around the seasonal weather is a good idea anyway , because you do n't want to cruise around the islands near El Nido when it 's raining or overcast , or get rained out during your beach vacation in Malapascua . <h> How I keep track of my expenses <p> I used my indispensable travel budget app Trail Wallet , which I highly recommend to track your expenses . You can read more about it here . <p> Have you been to the Philippines and got any tips to share on how to travel in the Philippines on a budget , or were you able to spend less than I did during your trip ? Please share your experiences in the comments below ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 34 Comments <p> This is just the post I needed . I want to travel to the Philippines as a part of my upcoming RTW trip , but for ages I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views regarding expenses . Some people said its cheap , other people says its expensive . It was refreshing to get a different view and such a detailed budget = <p> The Philippines is n't exactly the cheapest Southeast Asia destination , but I agree that its totally possible to do it on a budget . I spent about $40 a day ( but since I was there for 2 months I was n't moving around as much as you were ) . I like that you include all the info about booking flights ahead of time . That is SO key . The only reason I ended up tacking the Philippines onto my Southeast Asia trip was because I hit up some crazy AirAsia promos . I booked a ticket from Manila to Kalibo ( Boracay ) for like a $1 . And I found an exit ticket from Cebu to Kuala Lumpur for $15 ! I was very proud = <p> Justine I guess I learned it the hard way ( booking flights early = ) The deals you found are amazing , especially Cebu to KL for $15 ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotions to the Philippines I 'd jump on an offer like that ! <p> When I travelled in South East Asia in 2009 , the Philippines was actually my cheapest country I think I managed to average less than -20 a day ! I guess that was a lot to do with the fact that I only travelled on Luzon island , and so went everywhere by bus/jeepney , and only flew in and out of the countryand this was 6 years ago and I was much less fussy about where I 'd sleep than I am now ! <p> -20 a day ! ! ! Aaah amazing , Sam . I would be interested in seeing how much you 'd spend in 2015 though = And trust me , my budget breakdown includes some places that I would have rather not slept at but in El Nido for example , I just could n't find anything decent in my price range . I made up for it with some 4* and 5* hotels in Thailand though = <p> Great tips Dani ! I will be there over Christmas and New Years this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I am planning to be there for 28 days so will prebook all my flights as well as accommodation around the holidays would you say it would be OK to wing it generally with accommodation and just show up ? <p> Thank you , Katie ! = In some places I was okay just showing up ( Siquijor for example ) but in Dumaguete I was lucky to get one of the last beds and in El Nido I went to so many guesthouses that were full that I started to think I have to sleep in the street . I 'd definitely pre-book for the period of the Holidays since many Filipinos will travel then as well . I might run into you when you 're in the Philippines if things go according to plan , I 'll return to the Philippines in January = <p> Thanks , Carrie ! And yes , so worth the money ! ! I took a couple of similar tours in Thailand a month later and I paid double the money for tours half as good as the ones in the Philippines , so now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pizza was delicious .. and totally authentic Filipino food = But everybody was raving about that one pizza place in El Nido that makes really good Italian-style pizzas , so I had to go see what the fuss ( and the lines out the door ) were all about . Its named Atrove , and yes the pizza is definitely worth the splurge , if you ever find yourself in El Nido = <p> Given that your average reader ( as well as the average person reading that $50/day book being hawked ) , is from the US , it is completely and utterly disingenuous to ignore the trans-pacific flight costs . <p> At the very cheapest , such flights would be $700-1000 , for a 1 or 2 week trip , which means the cost to Phillipines ( or really any other vacation destination ) will be well over $50/day . <p> All this is just a way to sell that ridiculous book slogan , which is completely and utterly false . Sorry but no , $50/day is only possible if you 're a full time nomad , not someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 weeks off . <p> I completely agree with you which is why I did n't  include my cheap flights to and from the Philippines from other Asian destinations . It still gives people an idea what to expect when they get there , and they can plan their budget accordingly . Also , I have many readers who are already on a round-the-world trip or South East Asia backpacking trip , and they will obviously have a completely different expense for their flights as someone whod go just to the Philippines . <p> Siargao island &amp; Malapascua r still pretty cheap to visit . Go now before it follows boracay and el nido . There 's also Coron in Palawan , Caramoan and Calaguas in Bicol Region . U just missed Camiguin just down of Bohol ( the volcanic island w water falls , white beach sandbar , and hot springs ) . In Manila , check out the new city of dreams . Also , the newly opened 3d interactive museum in Cubao . And the scenic tagaytay just 1:30 hr south of Manila . Mt pinatubo , sagada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , but these r the usual routes for tourists . Thousands of Philippines islands r really stunning , and has something to offer ! Best wishes ! <p> I cant wait to visit Malapascua and Coron ( was bummed that I ran out of time during my visit ! ) was n't sure if Siargao is worth it because I do n't  surf but I keep seeing photos and it looks sooo beautiful ! Thanks so much for all the recommendations some of the places I have n't even heard of and will google them now I cant wait to go back and discover more of the Philippines = <p> Make sure to check the weather for El Nido because I 've heard that it can be a bit of a let down during the rainy season . And look into the Tao Expedition from El Nido to Coron , I think I 've told you about it and its well worth the splurge . If you consider doing it , I 'll send you a couple of articles about it . The Cebu website is awful but sadly they 're often the cheapest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful breakdown of costs . were thinking of travelling there next year and I know I need to start thinking about budgets and travel plans , but I had n't  yet really gotten my head around this . This will help a lot . In reference to one of the previous comment , we will definitely have to fly in from far away and wont be able to spend that long , so the cost of the trans-pacific airfare will definitely be one of the largest components . <p> Everythings spot on ! I tend to have 4 or more cups of coffee a day , so I always bring several sachets of pre-mixed coffee and just ask for a cup of hot water wherever Im at , otherwise itd make up 25% of my daily expenses . Was that pizza from altrove ? <p> Thanks , Emma ! I met a guy from Australia in the Philippines who told me his flight from Oz to the Philippines was cheaper than one of the flights he took within the Philippines ! ! There must be crazy good offers now = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post ! I 'm planning a slightly ambitious shoe-string budget trip to the Philippines in March 2016 = I was just wondering when you visited Philippines and the duration of your stay . Also , what was the weather like at the time ? It will give me a slightly better idea of what to expect . <p> Hi Nina , thanks so much ! I went at the beginning of this year and spent a total of just over three weeks in January and February 2015 there . The weather was still great at that time of year I think the monsoon season does n't  hit until May , so you should be good = Let me know if you have any other questions = <p> I am so proud being a Filipino ! Thanks for visiting our country , I hope you will never get tired or bored visiting our place . yes , traveling in the Philippines is better cheaper compared to other countries that 's why a lot of tourists do n't  hesitate to visit here . I highly suggest that you would also visit Cagayan de Oro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am sure , you will have a wonderful experience again . <p> Thanks , Jenifer ! = You live in a beautiful country and thanks so much for the recommendations for my next visit . I definitely want to check out Siargao high on my list ! and return to Palawan . And now Ive added Cagayan de Oro and Camiguin , wow .. looks amazing ! ! Thanks again = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143023 @2543023/ <h> Where to stay in Berlin : The Cats Pajamas Hostel <p> During my last visit to Berlin , I decided to stay in a hostel instead of with friends , simply because I had a lot of work to catch up on and wanted to make sure I 'd have some time to myself . Whenever I stay with friends , I end up staying up all night , catching up over a bottle of wine ( or two ) .. Work ? Not so much . <p> When I was searching for a hostel , I knew that I did n't  want it to be a huge party hostel like Generator or Plus , I was looking for something smaller and quieter.Choosing a hostel in Berlin can be pretty overwhelming , considering how many hostels there are in this city . Which one is good , which one is in a good location ? <p> My search led me to The Cat 's Pajamas Hostel in Kreuzk+lln , the area of Berlin where the two hippest neighborhoods , Kreuzberg and Neuk+lln , meet , and which happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  even look any further , I reserved a room right away.I arrived in Berlin on a rainy day and was lucky to discover that the hostel was located only a short 3-minute walk from the Hermannplatz subway station . <p> Inside it was cozy and warm , and all the staff were enthusiastic and welcoming . The lobby was designed in a way that made you want to linger , and the kitchen right behind was spacious and spotless , a place where you actually feel like cooking or preparing a meal , unlike many other hostel kitchens I 've come across on my travels . The hostel , which was opened in 2012 , and is now in its third year , seemed actually much newer than it actually is , and just show how much attention is paid to cleanliness and upkeep.In the mornings , a breakfast buffet is set up in the kitchen , which you can get for only G4.50.Rooms are located on the upper floors , and my 2-bed room still felt so new and shiny and yet comfortable and livable that I did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rain storm . In fact , there was even a desk , facing the window , which got quite a bit of use during my time in Berlin.Another feature I really appreciated was that every bed had a reading light and every bed had power outlets . And not only were there large lockers in the room for my valuables , but also storage space for clothes and other things you might want to unpack " most hostels do n't have any room to put something , unless you lock it up . So this was definitely well thought-out design feature . The room was also big enough to do yoga or a workout on the floor.You usually see how well a hostel is kept up when you use the bathroom , but the shared one that belonged to my room and two other rooms was absolutely spotless at all times . A giant bathroom with shower and toilet and room to hang your stuff also something that most hostels still cant get right , especially the ones that only have shower stalls and you have to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the clothes you 're wearing and your towel . Here , I had enough space to dry myself after my shower , put lotion and makeup on , all while not jot necessarily having to get dressed yet . Perfect ! The other bathroom on the floor where my room was located even had a hairdryer and make up mirrors another standout feature and something I 've never seen in a hostel before ! The hostel had the perfect level of privacy and mingling that I was looking for : if I wanted to chat and meet other travelers , the kitchen was a melting pot of cultures but I could retreat to the privacy of my room when I needed to work . <h> Standout features <p> The location was an absolute highlight for me , but I know that first time visitors who are looking to see Berlins historic sights prefer to stay in Mitte . <p> If you 're looking to experience some of the coolest neighborhoods in the city and just get a feel for how Berlin ticks , its the perfect location . Plus : Mitte is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy a transportation day pass anyway.The cats pajama hostel is in walking distance to the trendy Schillerkiez and the airport-turned-park former airport Tempelhof , the Turkish market at Maybachufer ( every Tuesday and Friday ) , some of the best ( and cheapest ) Lebanese food right down the road on Sonnenallee , Volskpark Hasenheide Park , the Landwehr Canal ( a popular hangout spot in the summer ) and countless cafes , bars and eateries . <h> Room for improvement <p> The wi-fi was spotty at times , and I saw in some reviews that other travelers had trouble connecting sometimes , as well , so I guess wi-fi could use an upgrade . Other than that , I did n't find a single thing to complain about ! 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Youll read about couples and even full families who have housesat in places like an actual desert oasis , on tropical islands , on a beach in a tropical jungle , and a few in exciting global cities in the world . They save thousands of dollars on accommodation , make some great local friends , and one lucky couple even had their own service staff on hand in the lap of luxury ! <h> Three months on a tropical island in Fiji <p> Lisa and Cheryl of WhatBoundariesTravel.com <p> From the porch of our house sit , were watching sailboats slide across the bay as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paddy , the adorable dog , is curled up at our feet occasionally rolling over for a belly rub . Were in Fiji and we still have to pinch ourselves to believe were really here . Fiji a sultry , tropical locale we 've only dreamed about visiting and now well be living here at almost no cost for 3 months . <p> It started innocently enough while we were back " home " in Florida , deciding what course our busy lives should take next . We knew travel was at the top of the list , but how could we manage to see all of the awesome places and stay long enough to feel like locals ? Through our web site , Will Work 4 Travel , we 'd already discovered work exchange programs like Helpx and WorkAway , but what could we do to allow ourselves time to write and work on our own ? <p> House sitting was the answer ! We found and registered with the first service we discovered , House Carers , and started looking . The Fiji house sit popped up and we decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one we wanted . Waiting anxiously to see if they wanted us , too , we began to plan . We jumped up and down when we got the confirmation and havent looked back since . House sitting is now our preferred way of seeing the world and stretching travel dollars . <p> While we were in Fiji we became a part of the community , attending Rotary Club meetings , volunteering at the hospital , serving as honored Chief Guest at the Secondary School Library Week , and becoming friends with so many of the colorful people who made our stay so special . It was more than a way of saving money . House sitting in Fiji gave us the opportunity to love Paddy and to make so many wonderful memories of a place where we werent just visitors , but truly felt like we belonged . <p> Lisa Chavis and Cheryl MacDonald are two forty-somethings who decided to sell everything and travel the world .

This fantastic city , so full of museums , restaurants and theaters is also ridiculously expensive . Our three week assignment , found on TrustedHousesitters.com , was to care for one dog and two cats in a typical Northeastern suburb . The house came with a relaxing garden , large kitchen and comfortable sitting room where we could watch British TV to our hearts ' content . But our favorite activity , when we were n't out walking the dog or attempting to cuddle the cats , was walking the ten minutes to the Tube to head out on the town . In only half an hour we could be in the West End , Hyde Park or walking along the Thames towards the Borough Market . Saving over a thousand dollars on accommodations meant we had tons of extra cash to spend having fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than any place we could afford to rent in London .

It is located on the island of Langkawi , Malaysia where many- Expedia hotels are located and in our opinion is a true luxury villa , laid out in an open air floor plan. - We found this great spot through the website trustedhousesitters.com . The owner has welcomed us with open arms even though I have a large and active family of 3 boys . I think she was interested in having a lot of people in order to provide the 2 dogs with constant attention . They are somewhat high needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think helped . We are at the house for 6 weeks , where we are enjoying playing with the dogs , swimming in the beautiful pool , and admiring the lovely ocean view . We are responsible for watering plants , keeping the pool and house clean , and most of all taking care of and loving the dogs , 1 of which has some medical issues . It was a great spot to be as Langkawi is really beautiful and full of so many fun things to do . Being here so long has availed us the opportunity to see it all . <p> As an aside , a tip of sorts , I would say that someone with a larger home or someone who already has children would be the most likely to select a family to do the house/pet sitting . But I basically contact anyone I think fits with our time frame and location .

We had never been on one before , and the opportunity to spend 3 weeks on a canal in this beautiful city was a true joy . The best part of the experience was the family of swans who came up to the window twice a day to look in and beg for treats .

I could not resist the opportunity to live on an oasis in such a rural , exotic-sounding place . Especially tempting was when I discovered there is a camel souk ( market ) on Saturdays . Imagine the experiences we could have ! <p> The housesit is very rural , approximately 15 km from the nearest real town , and to get there we have to wait on the road for an hourly bus or shared taxis to drive by . In town we are usually the only white people . Most locals speak French , others speak only Arabic , so we communicate with a little French , a little Arabic , occasionally a little Spanish , and some pantomiming . <p> Life is extremely simple here . On the oasis you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , it 's like stepping back in time. - The town is not very large. - Grocery stores do n't sell fresh items , so meat and produce is obtained through various vendors . - Your chicken is still running around when you go to buy it. - The poulterer takes care of all the yucky work to get it ready . - Our favorite bread vendor enjoys giving us brief Arabic lessons during our twice weekly trip to get supplies. - Our preferred vegetable vendor greets us with an almost toothless smile as he offers the traditional Arabic greetings one gives a friend . <p> We have regular power and running water , but no landlines for the phone . Internet is through a USB modem and is very slow . The refrigerator runs on propane and a small metal box connected to a propane tank serves as an oven . <p> While simple , remote , and only a few steps above camping , it 's impossible to beat experiencing this type of life. - We have had an insider 's look at Moroccan culture and daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talon Windwalker is a single parent who left his traditional work life- in May 2011 and embarked on life as a full-time nomad , traveling around the world slowly with his son , who was 9 years old when they began their new life .

That 's why we refer to it as this underground movement , because its truly starting to become popular now <p> Great Cheryl ! We just stay vigilant across the many websites that we are members of and apply for anything that fits in with our schedule . Once you get your application letter and your profile down pat , homeowners with the housesits you really want are more likely to apply ! Good luck ! <p> I know what you mean Tammy ! What an interesting , original glimpse into life in Amsterdam ! And you know that any sort of hotel experience would easily cost $100 a night or more for something so original . What an opportunity . <p> Inspiring stories ! As the owner of Trustedhousesitters.com were thrilled to read about all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting results from a survey we 've just carried out with all our registered house sitters . 76% of sitters , who had completed their profiles , had secured a house sit via our website . These were people that had included the basics we recommend on their profile a photo , references can be character and requesting a police check certification from their local police costs about $10 to get and very easy ! . <p> Andy and I who set up the business love to house sit too and recently completed a round the world trip house sitting its a wonderful way to immerse yourself as a local but do take heed that there are responsibilities as a house sitter and of course a love of pets has to be a big priority . <p> For me , I love nothing more than taking a dog for a walk down a foreign beach and meeting locals this way , it really does open up so many more doors and introductions , when caring for a local or expats home and pets . <p> Rachel , thanks so much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful housesitters through TrustedHousesitters ! I just wanted to say that walking our temporary dog Loba down the beach in Mexico was one of my absolute favorite things to do , too ! Its funny because moments like those are more common than you might think , since we also had the same thing in Costa Rica , too . These are those tiny , secret , endearing moments you get with housesitting that add up to make the experience so unique ! <p> Great list of house sitting adventures and we are delighted to be part of it . Were also happy to say that our house sitting continues ! We will spend the month of April looking after a huge house in the hills above the Pacific Coast of Panama . Ca n't wait ! <p> Oooh ! Congratulations on the housesit in Panama , how exciting !

You will find loads of housesits around Europe over the summer , we have seen several pop up already that wed be very tempted by and there are also several in Spain that are 6+ months , so conceivably you could get rid of rent altogether ! = Good luck ! <p> Thanks for including our Kyoto housesit and putting together this inspiring list of housesits . Every experience here is so diverse and just shows the adventures you can have housesitting your way around the world . <p> Awesome article ! Thanks SO much for including us ! Tomorrow we start the first of 2 more housesits in New Zealand and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It really is an amazing way to travel and stretch your travel dollars ! <p> Wow , some very beautiful housesits there ! I think our most memorable will be our current one , not so much because of the location or the house but because of the length ( 5 months ) . It really feels like were actually living here ( in France ) rather than just visiting . <p> A 5 month French housesit is what one might callthe dream ! = I wish we could take things like that but I can only be in the EU for three months at a time . Love your site , guys , well have to stay in touch ! <p> Thanks ! We do love your blog , so it would be great to keep in touch = Its pretty awesome living in France , but do n't  be too jealous ! The house has no heating and the Pyrenees get mighty cold in the winter = <p> Great stories this provides more motivation for me to get going with housesitting . Its been on my to-do list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons , including lack of experience and references , although Rachels comment above gives me hope . <p> Hey Scott , do n't  worry too much about the experience and references . As we always say , start by telling your friends and family of your interest and see if you cant get a few housesits through personal contacts first . Everyone gets their first housesit somewhere = and its just such a great way to travel . Good luck ! <p> I had never considered a housesit until I started reading about it on websites such as yours . You guys are so enthusiastic about it that I think I have convinced my significant other to give it a go the next time we set out to travel together . That 's what I love so much about reading travel blogs : there are so many ways to travel the world that I had absolutely no idea about ! <p> Jessica I had a look around your website and you two seem like housesitting would be perfect for you ! Look into it for sure ! I happen to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it right = Seriously , though , you should definitely get involved ! <p> Tamara , there are also short notice housesits out there too , though my advice there is to sign up to at least two housesitting sites to maximize that aspect . But we once were housesitting in Germany in Spring and were wondering what to do for Easter coming up in like 18 days , and saw a housesit advertised short notice in Tuscany and within about 10 hours the homeowner had chosen us . They 're definitely out there = Good luck ! <p> The more I read about housesitting the more I am inspired to do it . I love the diversity of the different places people have stayed . The idea of a houseboat in Amsterdam appeals as does a 5 month stay in France but I must remember to keep in mind the 3 month visa restriction ! <p> These are fantastic . I house-sat during rainy season in Costa Rica . I could n't believe I got to leave my one-bedroom hut and live in a sprawling three-bedroom house with flowering trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con I used . Seems like a dream ! Yay for encouraging house-sitting ! ! <p> Just read about your house siting and all I can say is WOW ! Totally amazing and wonderful thing you guys are doing . You are blessed to be able to travel , see all sorts of exotic places , and learn new cultures all by helping out someone else . <p> I have a pet sitting business , and it would be surreal to be able to pet sit all over the globe : ) . <p> Hi Treanne , thanks for stopping by ! We are essentially pet sitters in that sense , as only one housesit was ever pet-free . With all your experience with pets youd probably be snapped up in one of your first applications- maybe give it a shot , even just for a couple of weeks getaway : - ) <p> Definitely not a bad idea , Matt = That 's how we ended up in Tucson in 2010 we landed a housesitting gig there and ended up falling in love with the town and the Sonoran Desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi Jo , that sounds great ! Where in Italy will you be ? Well probably have tons of advice = Its definitely worth it checking out some Italian language learning classes there are some good ones on YouTube for the basic phrases . Will you have a car available ? 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143028 @2543028/ <h> Hotel Tip of the Week : Casa Kreyenberg Valparaiso , Chile <p> Welcome to our Hotel Tip of The Week series . Being on the road every day of the year means we stay at countless hotels along the way . For all the dingy , disappointing budget digs , there are as many budget accommodation gems . We post one hotel tip of the week , every week , of places we feel confident recommending after having tried and tested them ourselves . <p> Lucias grandfather inherited the house from his close German friend Herr Kreyenberg , who had the house built in the early 20th- century . They first started renting out rooms here roughly six years ago , first to local boarders until they found more success with a sign they hung outside to attract travelers . <p> Now it is an award-winning hostel that feels like staying at a German grandmothers house . Everything here seems totally original , from antique radios and ceramic spice jars to the dining room wallpaper and bone-handle knives we use each morning to spread large pats of butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast is a familiar affair , with all guests sitting around the wooden dining room table and talking travel over fresh fruit salad , cheese and ham , rolls , butter , marmalade , tea and coffee . <p> Normally it might be hard for us to make conversation so early in the morning , but in this house , we really get to know many of the other guests . Several mean to stay two nights end up staying a week even we extended from five to seven nights . Plus , people tend to gather on the terrace in the evenings with Juan Pablo and Lucia , who are always happy to sit down and have a glass of wine and a chat with the lights of Valparaisos hills twinkling below . <p> The beauty of Valparaiso appears everywhere you look . We are in a double room with amazing views of the port and the colorful houses on the hills out of the window as well as from the small balcony we share with the triple room next door . The dorm room , which has six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have great views. - The walls of every room are decorated with Lucia 's paintings . She is an incredibly talented artist and the house is her own private gallery . <p> Our room is perfectly equipped with a comfortable big bed , with bedside tables and lamps , antique wardrobe and dresser and wooden floors that thankfully do not creak one bit . The room is spotless and spacious , and though it does n't  have an en-suite bathroom ( none of the rooms do ) we could easily have rented this livable room for a much longer stay . We sleep soundly , as one of the benefits of being this high up the hill is the lack of traffic at night , though buses do run right from outside the house down and into the center of town throughout the day . <p> There are two bathrooms upstairs and one downstairs that felt clean and always well equipped with toilet paper and soap . I find this remarkable because if I noticed one thing about the guests here at Casa Kreyenberg they linger . They hang out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests sit outside on the terrace , or in the living room on the couch . With full use of the kitchen after 1pm , its easy to cook up a meal or make tea and you genuinely feel at home and welcome here to just rest , relax and take in Valparaiso . <h> Stand Out Feature : The views from the terrace <p> I 've already said it , but it is worth emphasizing . I doubt there are many hotels in this price range with such perfect views out over the city , the port , the naval ships in the water , the colorful houses lining the hills . Sitting on the bed writing this , I am constantly distracted watching the sun glisten off the water out in the Pacific below . Even if you have a bed in the dorm you can sit out on the terrace and take in the sunrise , sunsets and glimmering lights in the dark the views here are incredible 24 hours a day . If you will be in Chile in December , book a room at Casa Kreyenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Years fireworks displays in all of South America ! <h> Stand Out Feature : The owners Juan Pablo and Lucia- <p> Lucia and Juan Pablo are some of the friendliest hoteliers in the business . On Sunday night they organized an impromptu asado ' , a typical Chilean barbecue . All the guests ate together and got to know each other that way . The two of them are gracious hosts , going above and beyond with travel advice and any other assistance you might need . <h> Room for Improvement : A bit of renovation would go a long way <p> While the original fixtures and furnishings are part of the charm , renovating a few elements could give Casa Kreyenberg a pleasant facelift . Shower heads in both bathrooms could be upgraded , for example , and dishes , cutlery and pots and pans in the kitchen could use an upgrade . None of these things detract from the hostels charm ; instead it would just take the guest experience to the next level . <h> Overall <p> A quick glance through the TripAdvisor reviews will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kreyenberg , but staying here has made us nervous as we have read more than one reviewer call this the best place they stayed in all of South America . This is our first stop of many , many more budget accommodation stops to come , and we think we may have already stayed at the best ! 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

We love the laid-back vibe in this little village by the Nam Ou River , plus there is plenty of hiking , cycling and exploring to be done during the day , and even more ways to relax at night .

Wi-fi is available , but for now you have to pay for it . <p> Price : 350,000 kip ( $43.80 ) <p> CT Guesthouse CT Guesthouse is located right behind the bridge on the east side of the river , and has rooms in two different buildings . We stayed here for a few nights , and found the rooms are spacious and clean , and hot showers were definitely hot .

Plenty of tour companies in town can take you on a 1-day tour . It 's an adventurous trek " expect to stay wet for hours and make sure to bring sturdy shoes " but the scenery is more than rewarding . Lonely Planet founder Tony Wheeler did it in 2009 and wrote about the 100 Waterfalls in Nong Khiaw hike here . <p> Hike to the caves There are two different caves near Nong Khiaw : the Tam Phatok Cave south of town ( east of the river ) , which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ) along the paved road , or you can rent a bicycle in town and get there in 20 minutes . Entrance for the cave is 5,000 kip ( $0.63 ) and another 5,000 for a flashlight " but we did n't necessarily need one . The lady who sells the tickets will watch your bikes . <p> The other caves are also east of the river , but about an hour walk north along the unpaved road next to the river ( the path starts by the Sunrise bungalows right by the bridge ) . At the beginning of the little village there is a ticket booth where you can buy tickets for 10,000 kip ( $1.25 ) to enter the cave " some of the local kids will guide you there . <p> Rent a bicycle and explore the surrounding area There are several places on both sides of the river that rent bikes " we opted for some mountain bikes from a rental place near Delilah 's ( west of the river ) . You can either follow the dirt road east of the river north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village and waterfalls ; or ride on the paved road south towards the mountains . The ride can be rigorous in parts but the scenery is seriously stunning and the local kids from villages who come sprinting up to you will melt you heart . Bring some extra pens , as kids will ask you for pens , pens often . <p> Relax in an herbal steam bath We love this and can very highly recommend this very basic , very relaxing activity . The Sabai Sabai restaurant- ( opposite the temple on the east side of the river ) has a simple little wooden herbal steam room where you can relax for 15,000 kip ( $1.85 ) for as long as you want . Herbal tea , taken during frequent breaks , is included in the price , and you will leave feeling truly relaxed and cleared out of any congestion . <p> Get a massage Sabai Sabai also offers massages " a 1 hour massage will set you back at 50,000 kip ( $6.25 ) " just another great way to relax after a day of hiking or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the riverside bars The best bars and restaurants to watch the sunset from are the CT restaurant right by the bridge , and the Sunset Restaurant , both east of the river . Watching the sun setting over the mountains and seeing the sky turn purple while sipping a cool BeerLao was our nightly ritual and we could never get tired of it . <p> Watch a movie at Coco Home Coco Home ( on the west side of the river ) offers three daily movie screenings . You can enjoy your breakfast while watching a movie , or have lunch or dinner with a film . There is a big sign outside of the bar that says each day which movies are shown , so just decide which one you want to watch or stay for all three . The food is excellent and reasonably priced , as are the drinks . <p> Take a day trip to Muang Ngoi Neua One hour up the river ( reachable only by boat ) sits the remote little village of Muang Ngoi Neua , a tiny hamlet that still has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no phones and no amenities of the digital world existed . The village is , like Nong Khiaw , right at the shores of the river , and the simplicity makes the scenery all the more breathtaking. - There is only one main road , but plenty of restaurants are set up along it and related paths . Here you can hike to several caves where the locals used to hike during the Secret War . The hikes are worth it for the scenery alone , walking through rice fields between the steep mountains . Guesthouses here are seriously cheap if you decide to stay over night . We paid 40,000 kip ( $5 ) for a nice double room . There are no hot shower or wi-fi of course . <p> If you do choose to come for the day , you 'll need to hire a private boat , and the more people you 'll find , the cheaper it gets " we actually joined a group of 10 on their ride up and they had hired the boat ( incl. driver ) for $50 . Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight necessary . We would have gladly stayed a few more nights here . <h> Where to eat in Nong Khiaw <p> There is no shortage of restaurants in Nong Khiaw and you can definitely spending a few days in town without having to eat at the same place twice . However , I am almost certain that you 'll pick a few favorites while there , just like we did <p> Mekara LaoThis restaurant has the best Lao breakfasts in town . We came here quite a few times , and though you could try a new local breakfast dish every day of the week , once we discovered the Lao pancake , it was our go-to dish . If rice for breakfast is n't your thing , you can also try one of the many German breakfasts . Spot on traditional , these German breakfasts are double the price , but still relatively cheap at 30,000 kip ( $3.75 , which for Germans is under 3 Euro ) and worth the splurge ' ! For lunch and dinner you can choose between a wide range of Lao dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwiches , spaghetti and garlic bread . They also have salads and most of the cocktails are only 10,000 kip ( $1.25 ) , with the most expensive cocktail is 15,000 kip ( $1.85 ) . <p> Coco HomeCoco Home has a great raised outdoor area with low tables and pillows to sit on . The inside tables ' offer an even better lounge feel , with comfortable beds to sprawl out on . The food is a mix of western , Thai and Lao dishes and while you pay a bit more for the Western food ( 30,000+ kip ) , you can get a delicious curry for 15,000 kip ( $1.85 ) . Wi-fi is fast , drinks are fairly cheap and there are three films on upstairs each day . A definite hangout spot on the west side of the river . <p> CT Restaurant CT has a range of daily changing home-made cakes , muffins , donuts and pies all well worth trying . Drinks are inexpensive , as are food portions which are very generous . The service is slow and we did meet an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this still our top choice to watch the sunset . <p> Sabai Sabai Sabai Sabai serves Western-Asian fusion , and they have an extra vegetarian menu . You can get fruit shakes for 6,000 kip ( $0.75 ) , the cheapest we found in town , plus 2-for-1 cocktails during happy hour . Curries are 15,000 kip ( $1.85 ) . <p> Delilah'sDelilah 's is definitely a step up from all the other restaurants in town . Run by a pair of expats , the restaurant offers create fusion dishes , daily specials , homemade cakes and when we were there , they were building a stone pizza oven outside which means that , as you read this , you might also find Italian-style wood-fire pizzas on the menu . We had a delicious appetizer there that we still think about : dark sticky rice balls with a delicious dip " if you see it on the menu , give it a try and let us know how you like it . Delilah 's has great wi-fi . <p> Other restaurants include : <p> Sunset ( at Sunset guesthouse ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the main road , east of the river ) <p> Songdao ( at Songdao guesthouse , west of the river ) <p> Sunrise ( at Sunrise guesthouse ) <h> Where to find free wi-fi in Nong Khiaw <p> Although this little town offers the feeling of being very remote , Wi-fi is widely available in Nong Khiaw , much to our surprise . The connection is not always speedy , but we were able to upload pictures ( slowly ) , send emails and do other work online . <p> HoboMaps is the best for an overview of Nong Khiaw and most of the places named above can be found on that map . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 22 Comments <p> I wish I had seen this post before we left for Knong Khiaw as we have just returned and one small comment in your post would have saved both of us LOTS of discomfort we got sick after eating at CTs !

The people were amazing and kids made my day with their smiles . <p> We heard about Delilahs before arriving but they were closed the whole time we were there and place looked like it was n't opening any time soon which is a disappointment after hearing how great it is there . <p> Also I have to add a restaurant to your list Morning Dew Restaurant <p> We spent a lot of time with Dith and Buel who own Morning Dew named after their 2 year old first born son . What an amazing family they are . Dith made us the most delecious Laos food and taught us so much about the culture . They have only been open 5 months but are doing an amazing job and work so hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream to share his hart with others and open a restaurant which is exactly what he has done very inspiring . <p> We Stayed at Sunset Bungalows also and loved it there we looked at the new rooms which were amazing but we stayed in the more budget bungalows which were perfect and comfortable . <p> Thanks for this post Im excited to read you gals loved this place too its the pure highlight of our trip so far and we cant wait to get back there one day ! <p> Kim , thanks so much for the detailed comment ! So glad that you also loved Nong Khiew its one of our favorite places in South East Asia ! We hope to return one day too , and we hope that the village wont change too much . Ca n't believe you also got sick at CT ! Thanks for the tip the restaurant must have opened just after wed been there ! Sounds like a great addition to Nong Khiews restaurant scene . <p> What an incredibly detailed and helpful post ! As I said in my other comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stopping in Nong Khiaw on the way to Phongsali so I am absolutely taking note of where to stay and eat and what to do while I 'm there thanks to this post ! <p> A heads-up , however , to future Nong Khiaw visitors : a friend and I stayed at Bamboo Paradise Guesthouse , and were both robbed of cash . The situation ended rather suspiciously , with the owner implying that she knew exactly where the cash had been in our rooms , as well as the types of currency stolen before wed mentioned it . The language barrier , of course , makes for a murky understanding of exactly what happened , but in short : approach with caution . <p> Follow up : loved my stay in Nong Khiaw . Heres what I found : Nam Houn also had bungalows for 50,000 kip . I was going to stay for 2 nights and she said , 90,000 for both nights ( 1 person ) . I ended up only staying one night and she still charged 45,000 . <p> Sengdao does not have wifi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden/river view which was Lovely ! ! <p> Delilahs just opened up a single dorm room with 6 or 8 beds . He s charging 30,000 kip/person. 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

A PowWow is a gathering of several Native American communities who perform their traditional dances and showcase their communities costumes , and not knowing much about Native American culture at all , despite several visits to the Southwest , including various Indian reservations , I decided that it was time to learn more about their culture and so we headed to Phoenix for the day . <p> A PowWow is traditional held so that Native Americans of different communities can meet , dance and sing together , make new friendships , and of course : preserve their heritage and culture . But there is usually a dancing and/or singing competition , in the case of the PowWow we went to , there were competitions for both .

@@107143036 @2543036/ <h> Tayrona , Colombia : Where the Jungle Meets the Beach <p> I loved Cartagena , but phew , that city was hot ! To escape the heat , we decided to head further east along the coast . We had heard glorious tales about breathtaking Caribbean beaches exactly what we needed to cool off.One place that came up over and over again in travel guides and on blogs was Tayrona National Park , one of Colombia 's most popular national parks . The park stretches along the Caribbean coast and into the foothills of the mountains of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , covering 12,000 hectares of land and 3,000 hectares of sea.Tayrona has several beaches , but is also famous for its wildlife and jungle hikes , including a full-day hike to El Pueblito , the ruins of a small historic village similar to the nearby Lost City ( which is the five day trek through the jungle that I set off on a few days later ) . We hemmed and hawed about spending the night in the park we thought that paying the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent a couple of days there . If you plan to spend the night , you do n't  even need to bring your own tent there are several camp grounds in the park where tents are already set up , all you need to do is bring a sarong , sunscreen , a change of clothes and toiletries and you 're good to go . There are even hammocks that you can rent , set up in rows of tens next to each other under a giant mosquito net.While that sounded easy enough , the stories of roaches and bugs ( including bed bugs ! ) in some of the hammocks and tents , combined with very basic washing facilities , sounded less appealing . In the end , we decided to visit the park just on a day trip and to return at night to the comforts of our private room and the inviting swimming pool at our hostel in Santa Marta.After seeing the campgrounds , where the tents were basking in the sun in 90+G heat all day , I was happy with that decision , but I cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wake up to the sound of the jungle as the sun rises in the morning , then heading straight from my hammock to the beach for a morning swim.Although that morning swim ca n't be enjoyed everywhere I was surprised to see that most of the long , wide sand beaches had red flags and insanely intense waves the current is too strong to even allow for a dip in the ocean . There were a couple of smaller beaches that were in little bays , protecting them from the open water , but because of the lack of swimming beaches , these were pretty crowded.But to get to these beaches , you first have to go on a jungle hike . Just before leaving for the park I found out that it is a one to two hour hike from the park entrance to the beaches . And the hike is pretty intense . I consider myself a seasoned hiker but even I got tired from the ups and downs of the trail , steps , rocky parts and sandy paths that we followed towards the beaches.I was hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single monkey showed itself , no armadillo crossed the path in front of us , not even birds peeked out of the woods . There are 56 endangered species in the National Park , however , almost all of them hidden deep within the jungle.Since we did n't see any wildlife , our expectations for the beaches grew and grew- as we marched through the jungle setting , hearing the ocean roar in the distance . Seeing the giant waves and red flags when we finally got there after nearly three- hours ( we stopped to take photos along the way and for a fruit shake at one of the camp grounds ) was somewhat disappointing , but nonetheless I enjoyed the hike through the lush , tropical greenery.But I am also spoiled , having seen so many stunning beaches around the world , so others might be more impressed than I was . I think if you 're coming down from Central America , you will have seen similar scenery and nicer beaches in Costa Rica , but if this is your first encounter with tropical jungles , you 'll appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concha ( Shell Bay ) . This beach also belongs to Tayrona National Park , but is located on its far western side , reached through a different entrance . We took a shared taxi from Santa Marta there which is the only way to reach Bahia Concha as there are no public buses , and whereas Tayrona was overrun by foreigners , this was much more of a local beach we were almost the only foreigners , the rest were Colombian beach goers . <h> How to Visit Tayrona National Park <p> If you 're staying in Santa Marta , you can take a bus to Tayrona for COP7,000 ( US$2.40 ) , which takes about an hour . At the entrance to the park , there are small minivans that bring you to the trail heads ( COP3,000/around US$1 ) . I recommend taking them or you 'll add an extra five kilometers to your hike . <p> If you 're only visiting for the day , make sure to get there early to make it worthwhile . Calculate around five hours of hiking time . <p> Pro tip : Flip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Note that May , June and September to November are the wettest times " if you are visiting Colombia 's Caribbean coast during those periods , you 're likely to encounter lots of rain and muddy trails . December to February are high season months during this time , you might have trouble finding a free tent/hammock , so arrive early if you 're planning to spend the night , or bring your own tent . <p> Most ( if not all ) hostels in Santa Marta offer luggage storage for several days , so you do n't need to bring all of your stuff with you if you are planning to spend a few days in Tayrona . <p> For more information on Tayrona National Park , check out these posts which helped me plan my own trip : <p> The complete guide to Tayrona " a four part series including everything you need to know about Tayrona : how to get there , costs , what to do in Tayrona , safety tips , where to stay &amp; what to pack . <h> How To Visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which costs about COP40,000-50,000 /US$14-17 ( best to negotiate a price before you get in ) . Admission to the beach is COP5,000 per person . There are several smaller restaurants near the parking lot , but the waiters also bring food to the far end of the beach . As for drinks and ice cream : there are a bunch of vendors walking around with coolers , all reasonably priced ( a beer was COP5,000 /US$1,70 ) <p> Bahia Concha highly recommended ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107143038 @2543038/ <h> Where To Stay In Brighton : Bed and Breakfast Snooze <p> Usually , when you book a B&amp;B in England , you know what to expect a traditional British home , with a few lovingly decorated old-fashioned rooms that evoke a homey feel . I love staying in B&amp;Bs you usually get to talk to the owners because they 're so small , and the experience is much more persona than a large , anonymous hotel . Sometimes , however , I feel that the rooms have a bit of a grandma feel and be decorated in a funkier way.Which is exactly what Tony and Paul , the minds behind Snooze in Brighton , did . Instead of your traditional British B&amp;B you get a B&amp;B experience with a twist here : I would call it B&amp;B extravaganza . From the moment you enter the B&amp;B , you cant escape the funky vibe that is maintained throughout the entire building . There is original artwork on the walls , painted in bright colors , even street art , with the center piece being a giant mural on the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture and accessories placed around the house , collected over the years in various flea markets and antiques shops in Brighton and beyond.I particularly loved the collection of old bottles in the breakfast room . At Snooze , no room is like the other , each one has a different theme , mostly related to music . My bedside table for example was a drum , and the walls were decorated with album covers.I had the chance the peek into one of the suites , and see for yourself : Isnt that a fabulous place to spend the night in ? I feel like that 's where rockstars in the 70s would have loved to stay ! No matter where in the house you looked , the one thing that was obvious everywhere was just how much love and attention to detail had been invested here , how much effort and thought had been put into making Snooze what it is today . The owners love of music , art and design is visible in each and every little nook and cranny at Snooze , and it was fun to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to wonder what Brighton must have been like in the times of the mods and rockers. - When Paul and Tony ( and their spouses ) took over Snooze in 2006 , it was a run-down B&amp;B , not known as Snooze yet , and in urgent need of renovation . It has taken years of renovations and collecting of the memorabilia to give Snooze the retro look it has now , and I am sure more artwork and little gems of bygone decades will be added in the future , adding to its quirkiness . Snooze is small , with only 6 rooms and 2 suites , which gives it a cozy feel , and enables you to get to know the other guests in the breakfast room while munching on eggs , beans and toast and everything else that goes into a traditional breakfast .

@@107143039 @2543039/ <h> Adventure Travel In Israel : Hiking the National Trail ( Part II ) <h> Part II : The Lower Galilee <p> When we started our hike on the third day , the scenery couldnt have been more different from the first two days of desert trekking . Instead of the expansive , ocher colored landscapes of the Negev Desert , we found ourselves in the Judean Lowlands with lush green hills.Pine trees were wrapping their surroundings in a mesmerizing scent , and birds were chirping . In the desert , there had been barely any sign of life . We hiked up Tel Azekah , a hill with wide open views over the- the Mountains of Jerusalem and the Valley Of Elah where , according to the bible , David battled Goliath . The mound itself is known for its burial caves from various periods and secret tunnels from the days of the Bar Kokhba Revolt.After a short introduction to the area and the events that led to David beating Goliath , we interrupted our nature hike to visit Jerusalem , Israels capital and most likely the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the city for a whole week later in my trip , I will talk about Jerusalem in a separate post and the city deserves a whole post in itself . <p> Jerusalem from a viewpoint outside of the city . Can you spot the famous golden Dome Of Rock ? <p> We then continued our trek on the National Trail in the Lower Galilee region in northern Israel and climbed Mount Tabor , also known as Mount Of Transfiguration . Mount Tabor is a stand-alone mountain , emerging majestically from the flatland area around it . It is famous for the Franciscan Church Of The Transfiguration that sits on its peak , and you 've guessed it , for being the site of the transfiguration of Jesus.Looking at the green fields at the bottom of the mountain , it seemed surreal that I had just traipsed through the desert a couple of days ago . This is one thing I love about Israel though despite being such a small country ( 8,522- sq- mi smaller than the U.S. state of Maine , or one sixteenth of the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other country of comparable size that I 've visited.Hiking the entire 620 mile ( 1,000km ) National Trail is quite an undertaking , but it is possible to do it independently as long as it planned right . The biggest and in my opinion most stunning part of the trail goes through the Negev Desert , where settlements are sparse and water is hard to come by . Most people either hide water rations in stashes that are commonly used by hikers or arrange for people to meet them and supply them with water and food . ( See below for more information on how to prepare for a hike of the INT . ) <p> The Negev Desert , where water is hard to come by <p> Our last big quest was to conquer Mount Arbel , where you can still see ( and enter ) dozens of caves that had been inhabited by Druze settlers three hundred years ago . These Cliff Dwellings reminded me a lot of the ones I visited in New Mexico last year and I was surprised about how similar life had been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of miles and an ocean away from each other.When we reached the peak of the mountain , we were rewarded with sweeping views over the Sea of Galilee , where many of Jesus miracles occurred , including him walking on water and him calming the storm . We enjoyed a coffee break right the rim of steep cliffs ( 1,250 ft / 380m high ) a coffee maker is something that is brought on every hike in Israel , I was told while looking out over Arab villages , date palm orchards and avocado plantations of northern Israel . We could see as far as the mountains of the Golan Heights , which reach well into Syria , and I was once again surprised about the inherent natural diversity of this small country . <p> Coffee with a view <p> Almost as much as the country is diverse in its landscapes , it is diverse in the religious communities that live here together in some places more , in others less peaceful . The trail passes Arab and Jewish settlements , sometimes villages that are home to both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Druze , a small religious community we got to know in the Lower Galilee when we had the pleasure to be invited for dinner at a Druze familys house , enjoying some of the best food I had in my entire time in Israel , while learning more about this little-known religion . It was fascinating to hear about their beliefs , traditions and history first-hand , and the people you meet along the INT are undoubtedly a vital part of the experience as a whole.This is what makes the Israel National Trail so special , compared to other long-distance hikes : the combination of historical and biblical places , magnificent and varied landscapes , urban experiences and a glimpse into Israeli life , plus the distinctly different people you meet along the way , - all of which add up to an incomparable experience.After this hike , we all felt like we had deserved our last stop of the trek : the Jordan River . It was here where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist , but we had much less biblical things in mind when we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a foot spa , which was available free of charge from the hundreds of little fish in the river that eagerly nibbled on the access skin of our feet while we were enjoying having slipped out of hiking shoes for the very last time was the perfect way to end our trek.While on the one hand , I was relieved that the strenuous hike was over and I 'd get to enjoy Tel Avivs city life , I felt like I had so much more to explore on Israels National Trail . The parts I had walked were just a teaser of the full route , whetting my appetite for more , but I could n't have gotten a better introduction to Israel than the week on the INT . I hope I 'll get to go back and hike the path in its entirety one day . <h> Practical information : How to hike the Israel National Trail <p> Guidebook <p> There is a comprehensive guidebook available in English , including detailed topographical as well as road maps , information on what you need to pack , where to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even contact details of people who offer water deliveries to the desert . This book also has information on the places you pass along the trail , detailed day-by-day treks and a list of Trail Angels . You can order the book on Amazon : Israel National Trail and the Jerusalem Trail ( Hike the Land of Israel ) . It is also available in the Stiematzky book store at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv ( outside the baggage claim ) . <p> I would suggest taking a long walk ( and increasing the distance ) for a couple of weeks prior to starting the trek . Do a couple of test hikes in your city/ a nearby forest with the backpack you 're planning to bring to see how long you 're able to walk with the weight . Five liters of water per day are necessary , and weigh more than you think . A couple of practice hikes with your backpack will allow you to get rid of some things should you realize your pack is too heavy .

The winters can get pretty cold , especially in the north . <p> North to south or south to north ? <p> North to south and Wikitravel has an excellent list of reasons why : Where should one start ? How to get in touch with Trail Angels <p> Make sure to call the Trail Angels before you head there- they might not be around or not have any availability that day . <p> It makes sense to pick up a SIM card with data for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to be able to look something up online when you 're on the trail . This site has a good overview of prepaid SIM cards with data in Israel . Note that there is not everywhere a signal though.Where can you find more information ? <p> The above mentioned INT forum is a wealth of information for any trail-related queries and you can post your own question in the forum . The IsraelTrail.net website has a great Resources Page with links to other websites about the trail . They also have an FAQ Page that answers all of the major questions people have before setting off on their hike , plus links to other sources . <p> American Julian Bender hiked the INT a couple of years ago and kept a detailed diary on his experience , plus information on trip preparation , packing , etc . <p> Diana Barshaw also chronicled her INT treks on her website along for advice for novice hikers and packing lists she hiked the trail in shorter segments , which is another option to do the trek : instead hiking all of the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or week-long trips . <p> If hiking the trail by yourself is n't for you , you can join the Walk About Love , an annual INT group hike that starts every spring in Eilat and finishes in Dan 81 days later .

@@107143040 @2543040/ <h> Life Lately &amp; Upcoming Travels : November 2016 Edition <p> In my monthly round-ups , I am looking back at my travels over the past four weeks , what went well and what did n't , and what 's next for me. - <h> Where I 've been <p> I started the month with a few days in Los Angeles , which were not in my travel plans at all followed by a full four weeks on Mexico . Which , well , also was n't part of my original plan , but in hindsight , I could n't have asked for a better turn of events , leading me to Puerto Vallarta eventually , where I am writing this now . You might remember from last months round-up that I was basically stranded in the U.S. after my trip to Istanbul fell through read on to find out how I ended up in Mexico instead.I flew into Guadalajara , Mexicos second city , where I spent a week , including a day trip to Tequila , and headed west from there to spend some time exploring the most popular towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Puerto Vallarta . <p> I had originally toyed with the idea of also visiting Guanajuato and San Miguel Allende , two towns north of Mexico City , but I quickly scrapped these plans I did n't  want to travel too much and rush around , knowing I 'd be having a limited amount of time because I would be flying back to California in early December . And even though I felt like I was n't moving around all that much , I ended up sleeping in 11 different beds over 30 days , meaning I was moving to a new places roughly every three days ( that said , I moved places within cities several times , ending up sleeping in four different places in Puerto Vallarta , for example . ) <h> Life Lately <p> Sigh . Its been quite a month . Donald Trump is president-elect . I got sick twice . I turned 36 . It couldve been such a great month , enjoying Mexico .. but , you ca n't escape reality . Even when you 're in beautiful surroundings . While I was completely bummed out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , I got over that disappointment pretty quickly . As soon as I hit the Purchase button for my ticket to Mexico , I was giddy with excitement . And now , after a month in the sun , I think this was a much better way to spend November than in Istanbul , where it wouldve been equally as cold as it had been in Seattle . <p> The disappointment I could n't shake off all month however : the U.S. election results ( see Lowlights below ) . I tried to make myself feel better in so many ways : I started reading a page turner . I went to the beach . I socialized . I spent hours chatting with my closest friends and family . I hugged puppies . And kitties . I ate tacos . Drank margaritas . Ate more tacos . But the news and social media were a constant reminder of what had happened and gloomy headlines made me realize that even though I was in Mexico , this was a reality that was still there . <p> But let 's look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowlights by far in November ! <h> Highlights <p> Los Angeles .. again ! <p> After I was in a bit of a funk when I spent nearly a month in the LA area in September , I was in high spirits when I arrived this time around . I was only supposed to have a layover in LAX , and fly straight to Istanbul from there , but after my trip to Turkey had been canceled only two days earlier , I decided to still use my ticket from Seattle to LA and figure out things from there . It was an excellent decision , because I arrived in LA during a heat wave and after basically shivering for the entire month in Seattle , I was more than ready for some hot weather . Being in 90F weather made me so happy . I also happened to be in town for a party my friends Jen and Chris threw at their house , I was able to reconnect with a friend I gotten into a little argument with in September , and I checked off a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been to : Highland Park and Mount Washington , which is up in the San Rafael Hills overlooking the city . <p> Returning to Mexico <p> Well , you might think the returning to .. was a theme this month , but I was actually traveling to places in Mexico that were completely new to me . It was during a morning stroll around LAs Highland Park neighborhood , which is largely Hispanic , that I decided on a whim to purchase a ticket to Mexico . Now it wouldve been easy to go to Mexico City or another place I already knew , but I decided it was time to see a new place . During my month in Mexico this past March / April I had only visited a couple of new places ( Cuetzalan and El Tajin ) , but there 's so much of the country I have n't seen yet . And that 's how I ended up buying a ticket to Guadalajara , and it felt absolutely amazing to be back in Mexico when I meandered through the beautiful historic town center , picking up fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast. - I just love this country , and it is one of those places where I can fall into a routine again easily , feeling at home straight away . <p> Beach life in the Riviera Nayarit <p> I just love beach life . There , I said it . Even though I 'm a city girl through and through , sometimes all I need is a dose of beach life to make me feel better . You might remember that I was struggling a little bit in Seattle because of how cold and rainy it was well , a few days on a beach is apparently all I need to feel alive again . I 've already touched on my not very exciting routine of beach runs , ocean dips , SUP sessions and sunset beers in last weeks Polaroid , but I want to say it again : I love beach life , and I felt the same way during my time in Long Beach in September . <p> Birthday splurge in Puerto Vallarta <p> Being a freelancer means I am constantly hustling for business , trying to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a budget most of the time . The times that I decide to splurge on a truly nice place to stay are rare , and my birthday this month was the perfect excuse for a little extravaganza . I had a visitor from the States , and so we did n't  only splurge on a fancy apartment in Puerto Vallarta , but also on nice meals during which I actually focused on the meal instead of working through it . The same goes for cocktails ( which I would n't drink by myself ) and hours spent away from my laptop . When I was n't traveling solo this month , I felt like I was taking in every moment much more consciously , and particularly those that made my birthday so special : rooftop cocktails , SUPing in the ocean , jungle hikes , and setting working hours , because I have to admit that I can easily spend all day long in front of my laptop when I 'm by myself , and that includes a whole bunch of wasting time on the internet , which would be better spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post election blues <p> The biggest lowlight of the month has been the election , without a doubt . Even though i 'd predicted the outcome exactly as it happened , discussing it with friends of mine already back in Europe this past summer , once the results were confirmed , I could n't stop crying for two days straight . Two days straight . I do n't  even remember the last time I cried that hard . I was sobbing uncontrollably in a Starbucks in Guadalajara , causing a scene . It was n't pretty . In case you 're wondering why this affects me , as a German , to such an extent , here 's a hint , but I have a detailed post coming up on that topic early next year , just in time for my 7-year quitversary ( I wrote about my 5-year quitversary here ) in which I will finally shine light on the big changes ahead of me that Ive been hinting on for a few months now . ( And if you belong to my inner circle of newsletter subscribers or Snapchat followers , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunsets were pretty <p> Anyway , back to the post-election blues . Luckily I know what to do in situations like this : do something that makes me happy . In this case , it was giving the green light to a visitor from the States to come down to Mexico ( which I had been on the fence about ) , surround myself with other people ( I moved from a deserted B&amp;B to a social hostel ) , and get my ass to a beach . In all honesty though , I am still shaken to the core by the outcome of the election and it took me days to get a full nights sleep after 8 November . After the first few days of resignation , sadness and disappointment , I am now trying to be more optimistic about everything but I have to admit that I am still struggling to come to terms with it . <p> Mexico arrival day <p> The day I arrived in Mexico , I nearly had a panic attack . I was so busy the day leading up to my departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about all the things that popped into my head during my plane ride to Guadalajara : <p> OMG I have n't traveled solo in months <p> OMG I have n't traveled outside the save havens of Europe and the US since April ( and back then I did n't  travel alone in Mexico ! ) <p> OMG I never traveled in Mexico by myself . <p> OMG I did n't  put cash on my debit card , so I cant use an ATM upon arrival . <p> OMG what if I forgot all my Spanish ? ! <p> Full on panic mode ! Luckily , as so often , everything fell into place as soon as I arrived in Guadalajara . I found 87 pesos in my change purse from my last visit to Mexico just enough to get me into the city on the public bus , my Spanish came back to me as soon as I had to ask for directions to the bus into town , luckily traveling by myself is something I 'm pretty good at , and , well , Mexico is one of the easiest countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple . <p> Being sick on the road <p> This month I got sick twice : I had stomach issues on my first day in Mexico ( I assume from some fresh fruit I had picked up ) which led me to spend more time in the bathroom over the next couple of days than I was comfortable with , and then I got a cold just in time for my birthday on Sunday . I am still battling my cold ( that 's the disadvantage of staying in fancy hotels with AC I am sure it was the drastic difference in temperature between the chilled room and the 90F heat outside that made me sick ) and once again I was reminded that being sick on the road sucks . <p> When I was n't sick , life was pretty sweet though .. <p> Slow business <p> Luckily the peso / dollar exchange rate was in my favor this month , making Mexico even cheaper than it had been during my last visit in the spring . Because I did n't  earn a lot of money in November , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an inexpensive country , where I usually did n't  spend more than $35 a day ( except for my week of birthday splurges ) . <p> Slow business did not stop me from splurging on a hotel with a gorgeous infinity pool for a few days <h> Other happenings <p> The instant feedback on Snapchat is amazing . <p> Snapchat love <p> I do n't  really know in which section to put it , but I want to mention my Snapchat community briefly this medium has brought me so much closer to my those following my raw , unfiltered journey on their phones . ( For those of you who do n't  use Snapchat , its an app that let 's you record 10-second clips of anything you see / do and keeps it live for 24 hours . After that , its gone forever ) . And especially this month , I was so appreciative of all the supportive messages I received , not only for my birthday , but also when I was feeling really down after election day . So much empathy , outpouring of love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks to everyone following me and interacting with me I love the instant feedback to everything I 'm doing . ( If you want to follow my adventures in real time , add me on Snapchat : Mariposa2711 ) <h> What 's next for me <p> I 've already mentioned that I am on my way to sunny California .. for the third time this year ! After a long weekend in LA I will be heading north , however and that 's a first for this year , and a first in over six years , to be completely honest . The only time I visited the wine countries of Napa and Sonoma north of San Francisco was in 2010 , and when the opportunity arose to revisit Sonoma , and the town of Santa Rosa , where I spent barely any time back then , I did n't  have to think long . After that , I will finally return to New York but not for long . I had originally planned to spend the winter in South East Asia and already secured a housesit in Vietnam ( which , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ) , but urgent matters are calling me to Germany . You know that this must have been something super urgent , if it gets me to return to Germany in the death of winter ( More on that soon , I promise ) . <p> I will now be spending the Holidays with my family instead of a kitty , and while I am not a big fan of winter , I do appreciate Christmas markets , baking cookies , drinking Gluhwein , and see my nephews and nieces eyes light up when they see the wrapped gifts under the Christmas tree . I only spent one Christmas at home since 2007 , which was in 2014 , and still have fond memories of it , so I am not too upset about this sudden change of plans and Vietnam will have to wait a little longer . <p> I am not sure yet what I 'll be doing for New Years Eve knowing myself , I might end up going on a last-minute trip , so who knows where the last round-up of 2016 will come from <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Santa Rosa , CA and if you 're here , give me a buzz and we can get together for a drink or whatever . I sold my house in July and am living in my truck camper , all set to see the USA by RV . However , my next adventure is to take off for Vietnam in early February and travel around S/E Asia for the next 6 months , returning to California in August . Please let me know if and when you are in Santa Rosa or anywhere near . I could even meet up with you in Sonoma . You know I 've been following you for quite a few years and it would be nice to finally meet face to face . If not here , then maybe in Vietnam somewhere . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143041 @2543041/ <h> Road trippin in Southern Israel : Masada and Timna Valley <p> The 4am wake-up call was painful . What had I done ? Was it really worth getting up in the middle of the night to watch the sunrise from a mountaintop ? Not only did I have to crawl out of a bed at this ungodly hour , but I also had to climb up a steep mountain in the dark until I 'd get to reap the benefits of this arduous undertaking . I was tempted to turn around under my warm , soft blanket and turn off the snooze function on my alarm.But what was awaiting me on top of the mountain was enticing enough for me to she 'd off my comfy blankets and get out of bed : Seeing the sun rise over the Dead Sea.I arrived at the bottom of Masada , the plateau I was about to hike up via the infamous Snake Path ( not named for snakes , but for the many curves ) , in the pitch black darkness . Only the moon and the stars were illuminating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was due to rise at 6.30am , the climb was supposed to take an hour and it was already 5.40am when I finally got out of the car and started the hike.The rock on which Masada sits is 1,300 feet ( 400 meters ) high , and since the beginning of time it has been difficult to reach the top on foot , and even more difficult to capture.Masada means fortress in Hebrew , and that 's exactly what Judean king Herod the Great built up on the plateau between 37 and 31 BC . The fortified complex of palaces , storehouses , bathing houses and armories was supposed to be his winter residence.Thanks to its extraordinary setting and great condition of the palace ruins , Masada was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001 . Today , the rock is one of Israel 's most popular tourist attractions ( rightly so ) , especially during sunrise , but when I climbed the steep slopes of the dirt path at dawn , nobody else was there . Because I was late , I walked much faster than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of other hikers on my way to the top . It turned out that I was n't the only one here , I was just the last one who had started the hike.The path is only about 1.3 miles ( 2km ) long , but has more than 700 stairs and covers an altitude difference of 1,150 feet ( 350 meters ) . It might not seem like a long walk , but the winding path is quite challenging.When I reached the top , I was soaked in sweat and breathing heavily , but the sun was just starting to show itself , starting to paint the sky bright red behind the Jordanian Moab Mountains on the other side of the Dead Sea " I had made it in time.I walked around the deserted plateau , looking for a good spot to watch the sunrise and settled for a part where the ancient stone walls were still pretty much intact . I sat down and began to wonder what this place must have been like thousands of years ago when Herod used Masada as his winter getaway.The story Masada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however : the Siege of Masada at the of the First Jewish-Roman war which ended in the mass suicide of over 900 Jewish rebels and their families . Herod the Great had been dead for 75 years when the revolt of the Jews against the Romans began . After the fall of Jerusalem , a group of Jewish rebels fled to Masada and held out on top of the mountain for three years . Eventually , thousands of Roman troops marched against Masada with the Tenth Legion and constructed a rampart against the fortress , moved a battering ram up the ramp and breached the fortress ' wall . When the Jewish defenders realized that there was no way they could besiege the Romans , their leaders decided that they all should commit suicide rather than being killed by the Roman attackers.Because of its isolated and safe location , Masada stayed in a fairly good condition over the centuries , pretty much untouched by humans for about two millennia ! It was only excavated between 1963 and 1965 " fairly recently . I was amazed to find so many mosaics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most complete and biggest Roman siege camp that still remains today.I took a couple of hours to properly explore the buildings and the palace , marveling at the mosaics and the well-restored buildings , trying to imagine life up here 2,000 years ago.While rain water was collected in big cisterns which are also still intact , it is still a hard place to live with the harsh , lifeless desert surrounding the rock.I could see why Herold chose this place as his winter residency though : These magnificent views ! The breathtaking vista towards the Dead Sea in the east , and overlooking the Judean Desert towards the West.The scenery around the Masada is just spectacular.Walking around the plateau I got to take in the views in all directions , and I was almost tempted to do another hike in the Judean Desert , but I had other hiking plans already : Exploring Timna Park.The best thing about a 4am start is that you can fit in a lot in your day " and climbing Masada was only the beginning of a day filled with incredible landscapes and hikes.After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Masada , we hopped into the car and followed Route 90 further south . Our final destination was Eilat for some beach time and snorkeling in the Red Sea , but on the way , we 'd planned to stop in Timna Valley , a desert area known for its spectacular limestone and rock formations.We had 136 miles ( 220 kilometers ) of a scenic drive along the Dead Sea and through the desert ahead of us . Anyone who knows me knows how much I love the desert , and I was happy to sit in the passenger seat , being able to stop anytime and snap some photos along the way.We arrived in Timna Park about two hours later , and even though it was n't noon yet , we were met by an extreme heat when we left the car to buy our tickets for the National Park . When we opened the doors of the air-conditioned car , it felt like we were inside an oven ! Temperatures easily exceed 105 -F ( 42 -C ) in the summer months , and we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of the day , with no shade to protect us.The lady who sold us the tickets to the National Park made sure that we had enough water , advising us that there was no water anywhere in the park . Just sand , rocks , and limestone pillars.Armed with a map of the park we drove down the narrow road that led straight towards the rocks ahead of us.The valley , rich in copper , is famous for its ancient copper mines , which date back to the 5th millennium BC , and remnants of these mines can still be seen in various locations throughout the park , but what I found even more sensational was the natural beauty of the place.The massive , multi-colored rocks , ranging from orange to red to black , reminded me of the canyons and arches in my beloved Southwest of the U.S. , and also of the desolate desert of Bolivia 's southwest , even though that one is located at 13,000 feet and much cooler than this place . The erosion there managed to create some strikingly similar rock formations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to explore all the formations that Timna Park is famous for.There is the mushroom , a giant red sandstone monolith that has been formed into the shape of a mushroom by sand and wind , rising high into the desert sky.After a few stops at other formations , we reached the Arches , another famous rock formation in Timna Park , and you can hike up and even through the arches , from where you have a fantastic view over the valley.I loved how moon-like this area felt ; if you had put me down there and told me I was on Mars , I wouldve believed it . There was barely any life here the bushes were dry and brown , there was no green at all.We also stopped to see the Chariots , impressive rock drawings by the Egyptians , left many thousands of years ago when the Egyptians passed through this region.The Solomon 's Pillars were the perfect way to end our 4-hour tour of the park : three massive sandstone pillars that are towering 50 meters tall above me , definitely a highlight.The night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and while I was watching the crew pack up the stage , I could only imagine how staggeringly beautiful it must have been to listen to the music in this awe-inspiring setting.I wish I would 've had the chance to take some of the longer hikes , but it was just too hot . For my next visit to Eilat ( and there 's no doubt that there 'll be a next time ! ) , I know that I 'll be visiting Timna Park in the early morning when it is less hot.So far , this was one of the most memorable days in Israel : breathtaking views , a rewarding hike , thousands of years of history and stunning landscapes . 129333 @qwx989333 <p> Masada <p> You can visit Masada independently if you have a car or as part of a tour if you do n't have a car . <p> If you decide to hike up , start early . It gets incredibly hot in this region of Israel , especially in the summer months ( up to 109-F /43-C ! ) . The Snake Trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended since the path is rocky and steep , and there are many stairs . Make sure to bring enough water . If you hike up for sunrise , the cafeteria at the bottom of the rock will be open upon your return ( it opens around 8am ) . <p> You can also take a cable car up to the top , if you feel less active . Admission with cable car ( two ways ) is NIS76 ( US$19 ) <p> If you climb , and do n't take the cable car , admission via the Snake Path is NIS29 ( US$7.32 ) , but you can also hike up and take the cable car back down . Admission with one way cable car is NIS57 ( US$14.42 ) <p> The cable car is open from 8am till 4pm ( check the website for reduced hours on Holidays before your visit ) . <p> It is possible to visit Masada via public bus from Jerusalem , but the bus let 's you off at the Masada Junction on Route 90 and you 'll have to walk to the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times a day . The ticket from Jerusalem is NIS42 ( US$ . <p> Abraham Tours runs a Sunrise Masada Tour from Jerusalem which also includes stops at Ein Gedi and the Dead Sea . If you ca n't be bothered to get up early to see the sunrise , Abraham Tours also offers a tour with a later start ( 7am ) to Masada , Ein Gedi and the Dead Sea . Both tours are offered three times a week and cost NIS275 ( US$70 ) . <p> Timna Park <p> It is not possible to visit Timna Park without a car . If you do n't have your own car , you can book a tour from Eilat . The tours are pricey though ( nearly US$100 ) , and if you are a group of three or four people , it 's cheaper to rent a car for the day . That way you 'll also be more flexible . <p> It is easiest to visit Timna Park from Eilat , as it is only 17 miles ( 25km ) north of the seaside resort . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Allow at least four hours for your visit ; the park is spacious and the main attractions are spread out .

Annoyingly the thing that sticks in my mind is the cable car breaking down half way up rather than the site itself . Thanks for filling in a few gaps in my shocking memory . <p> I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these wonderful posts . I was at Masada at almost the same time ( end of Dec14 ) ; I went during the day and hence took the cable car up the fort . But for my next Israel visit , I definitely plan to do the early morning hike and see the amazing sunrise at Masada . Other than taking the Abraham Tours early morning bus , are there any other option of staying somewhere nearby ( e.g. In Gedi ) ? <p> On a different note , your detailed description of Lake Atitlan was my inspiration to travel Lake Atitlan in Guatemala . I was there at the magical place last year and went to all the villages you described ( stayed in Santa Cruz ) . <p> Prasun , thank you so much for the kind words = Yes , I know that there 's a hostel in Ein Gedi , and then there are the big hotels further south along the shores of the Dead Sea . I also hope I 'll be able to return to this special place . Oh and I have some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look forward to more details on Israel ! Other than Dead Sea &amp; Masada , my favorites in Israel were the Golden Coast ( Caesarea , Akko ) and Golan Heights .

Eilat and areas around Sea of Galilee like Safed , etc . On my to do list in my next trip is also to stay in a kibbutz and Bedouin camp ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143042 @2543042/ <h> Is Cafayate the most underrated town in Argentina ? <p> When I think of our time in Cafayate , I 'll always remember the shine of the afternoon sun bouncing off her smooth black hair as we sped down the perfectly paved path . She thundered along , right in between our two bicycles , as though in a race for a first place finish . I have never seen a dog so happy <p> The three of us were a united front , speeding through the vineyards , no traffic and only a few local pedestrians on the path that runs several kilometers along several vineyards just outside of town . - <p> Despite being one of the most gorgeous destinations in all of Argentina , we spent all afternoon riding , running and touring through rows and rows of plump grapes with almost no other tourists in sight . Very few had even mentioned Cafayate on our tour through the country but everyone told us about the more famous Mendoza wine country and maybe its better that way ! As usual , we had collected the stray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Her giant smile , a big limp and obvious hip issues endeared her to us right away , and when she snuck in the restaurant to sit under our table and did n't  beg for food at all , we became immediate friends , no strings attached . <p> That next morning we shared our breakfast of coffee and medialunas with her on the town square and then rented bikes from a nearby hostel . Based on that terrible limp , we just assumed she would n't be able to keep up and tried to make clear she should stay behind and let us tour the vineyards without her . <p> Not without our stray <p> That morning , over and over we repeated that we would see her later , wondering if we really would . And away we pedaled <p> We cycled through the dusty town of Cafayate , a romantic town with picturesque colonial buildings centered around one main plaza . It feels exactly how I would imagine a sleepy old Spanish colony to look . Throughout our stay , we spent part of each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream right on or around this central park all four days we were in town . Up here in the northern part of Argentina , you feel the difference , and the distance , to Buenos Aires . <p> Men stuff inconveniently large wads of coca leaves in their cheeks , so much so that I thought our bus driver had a deformity in his cheek until I saw the piles of leaves chewed up and spit out at the bus station . Dani and I powered through piles quinoa empanadas , much more common in northern Chile , Bolivia and Peru than the blue cheese empanadas in the countrys practically European capital . <p> Here , roads are wide , life moves slow , people wave and say hello . <p> We definitely had locals staring at us as our black stray began to follow us down the road , her distinct limp disappearing as she galloped and then sprinted in between the bikes . Ten minutes later we were outside of the town limits , and she stayed with us the whole day . We- spent the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , sneaking our stray dog in and sampling various red and white Argentine wines . <p> Cafayate is wine country but in a much more laid back way than Napa Valley , California or even its fellow Argentine brother , Mendoza the largest wine producing area in Latin America . <p> Eventually we headed back in the late afternoon where Dani stopped in at the Heladeria Miranda to try the famous Malbec wine ice cream ( definitely only hype it did not taste good ) . A much tastier stop was at the alfajores shop on Avenide Guelmes ( just a few steps from the south side of the main square ) for some freshly baked alfajores instead . <p> The next morning , we booked two spots on the afternoon tour of the Quebrada de las Conchas , the red dirt and layered mountain landscape that is similar to the Grand Canyon or Sedona in the southwestern U.S. , which we had already driven through on our way in from Salta . We worried how our stray would react to us getting on a bus without her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shade by the door of the restaurant where we first met.The day was spent climbing into and around rock formations and gorges created by wind and the Rio de las Conchas river for the next four hours , taking short hikes to some spectacular configurations and patterns . <p> The best time to see the gorge is in the burning glow right before sunset , so we would recommend doing an afternoon tour . First you visit Los Castillos , which is a massive wall perfectly whittled down into three majestic castles and a giant monolith called El Obelisco.Youll see a boulder on the side of the road called El Sapo , the toad , and we stopped at a roadside art stand , only to find the llamas and their matted dreadlocks the most interesting part . <p> The highlight of this day tour from town is the all-natural rock amphitheater with incredible acoustics that even puts Red Rocks , Colorado to shame . A young guy on our tour brought his guitar specifically to play here , but instead he and the rest of us stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing a desperately beautiful love song . The sounds gently swirled around the inside of the natural amphitheater . <p> As for Cafayate itself , there is a sense that this is a showcase city . Hotels , restaurants and enotecas take up real estate along the tree-lined streets , with locals living in run-down homes on the outskirts of town that few people ever visit . <p> One of the days , Dani went to buy bus tickets and I ran errands in preparation for our bus trip back through Salta and up further north just shy of the Bolivian border. - The largest pharmacy in town was jammed with locals , more than we had seen anywhere but the central square for the Saturday morning market . It made me wonder where they all live ; their dusty , worn clothes and scraped shoes indicated perhaps that they lived further out of town in some of the villages just beyond the green valley oasis toward the foothills of the incredibly dry mountains surrounding Cafayate , perhaps . <p> Leaving Cafayte , it was hard not to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor Grand Canyon . Deep reds and bright greens fill the valley in such a unique way , it would be a shame to miss this on a trip to the north west of Argentina . Just two hours from Salta the biggest city in northwestern Argentina Cafayate can be included in a week-long tour of the region along with Salta and - a road trip north through the Quebrada de Humuhuaca , the salt flats and the indigenous town of Humahuaca . <p> We cant promise you 'll make a furry friend while in town , but if you see our lovely on your visit , please take her with you on a trip through the vineyards she seemed to have the time of her life ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Cafayate was an accidental stop for us and we instantly fell in love with ita couple of days in glorious sunshine , the smell of grapes drying on vines , and a field-sized blanket of chillies drying in the sunlovely food , perfect wines , incredible sculpted landscapes <p> Thanks , Flora ! Definitely do n't  miss Cafayate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Humahuaca ( amazing scenery and indigenous villages ) and the Argentine salt flat ( less known than the big ones over the border in Bolivia ) = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107143044 @2543044/ <h> Where To Stay In Reykjavik : Loft Hostel <p> When I researched places to stay in Reykjavik , one of the first places I came across was the Loft Hostel . It was one of those hostels where I knew right away : that 's where I wanted to stay . The pictures of the rooms looked amazing , the location was excellent , customer reviews were great . But only because a place looks good on paper does n't  mean that it really is great there 's still the chance that something is missing , the vibes not good , or service has just gone downhill.As soon as I arrived at Loft Hostel and stepped into the busy top-floor bar , I was relieved to find out that my doubts had been- completely unfounded and that I did n't  have to worry about anything . The reception , located on the fourth floor of the building , is right next to the common area , which was filled with people when I arrived at night , travelers who were sharing stories over happy hour beers . The lively atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in instead of crashing in my room after a long day of travel.The deluxe private room I was sharing with Rease was fabulous I loved the modern artwork- on the walls , which is such a simple way to pimp up a room , and yet many hostel rooms still have bare white walls . An extra armchair- and a small desk made the room more livable and added to the cozy atmosphere . The desk actually got- some use , since the wi-if worked perfectly in our room ( as well as in the communal loft on the top floor ) . But my favorite part ? The bed ! Our double bed was so comfy that I was tempted to stay in bed the next morning when I woke up to rain . I did eventually get up though , because my tummy was tumbling and I had read that the hostel breakfast was excellent value for money of course I needed to find out if that was true.And yes the breakfast was definitely worth every cent , or every single one of the 1,550 krona ( US$11.86 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricey to you , wait until you get to know prices in Iceland its not necessarily a bargain- country . <p> We were able to load up our plates as often as we wanted , and the breakfast buffet included several breads , bagels , cheeses and cold cuts , yogurt and cereal , fresh fruit and unlimited coffee and tea . Plus and this alone was so worth having breakfast fresh chocolate croissants which were heavenly.For more budget-conscious travelers the hostel has a fully equipped kitchen , with spices and condiments and leftover foods from other travelers definitely one of the cleanest and best equipped hostel kitchens I 've ever seen . While the lounge was rather quiet during breakfast , it really comes to life at night when everyone gathers up here to mingle and meet new people , and the hostel makes you want to hang out up in the loft , providing comfy couches , lots of tables , and even a projector to show movies . I wish it would have been a bit warmer so that I could have taken advantage of the rooftop terrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , I got to take advantage of one more great feature- of the hostel- though : its prime location . Located right on Laugavegur , the main street in downtown Reykjavik , lined with shops , bars and restaurants , I could n't have asked for a better location . Within a few short minutes you reach- Reykjaviks famous- Hallgrimskirkja- church , the Sun Voyager sculpture &amp; viewpoint , the concert hall and souvenir shops as well as grocery stores . I thought that parking in such a prime location might be a problem , but given that Reykjavik is tiny ( at least for a capital ) with only 120,000 people , I was able to find parking right around the corner . <p> And if you need anything in particular , do n't  hesitate to ask at reception I found everyone I encountered at the check-in desk to be incredibly helpful and friendly .

But beaches are n't the only draw of the Sunshine State " there 's more to Florida than that , including fascinating nature that ranges from swamplands and crystal clear springs to the tropical islands of the Florida Keys . Add to that the dozens of pristine beaches , historic lighthouses , quaint rural towns , canopy roads and national parks , and you 'll get to experience a completely different state than the Florida that is famous for the glitz and glamour of South Beach , or its many exciting theme parks . <p> To showcase the most scenic parts of Florida , I put together the three most epic road trips in the Sunshine State for you " covering beaches , unspoiled nature and wildlife , tropical islands , art and theme parks , and some of the most iconic Florida sights . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 1 The Real Florida : Wildlife and Nature <p> As much as Florida is about beaches and waterways , there 's another completely different side of the Sunshine State to uncover " a more untouched , rural , and authentic side . With wetlands and lush green forests , and several springs and stops along the rural coast , this trip is a nature lover 's dream . <p> It starts in Tallahassee , the state capital , with its canopy tree streets formed by moss-draped pines and live oaks , continuing on to Wakulla Springs , and then following the lonely Highway 98 to Crystal River , with plenty of wildlife stops along the way . The final stop would be in either Tampa or Orlando " depending on if you 'd like to conclude the trip with a visit to Florida 's theme parks or if you would prefer exploring the cultural heritage of Tampa Bay . <p> Altogether , this road trip spans just over 400 miles if you 're ending in Orlando , and around 375 miles if you finish in Tampa . <p> Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could n't get any further away from the party scene of Miami . Many older people see the towns you get to experience on this trip as the Real Florida ' . <p> If you are a true wildlife and bird lover , you should stop at St Marks National Wildlife Refuge next , which is a 68,000 acre nature reserve just half an hour south of Wakulla Springs . Bird watchers in particular will love this wildlife haven . Manatee Springs Park , where you can swim with manatees in the crystal clear waters of the spring , is a highlight for many , and from there you 'll drive through marshland and wetlands to Cedar Key , a cluster of islands off the mainland , which is an old-fashioned laid-back Florida vacation spot . <p> From there , head back inland through sleepy rural Florida to Silver Springs , which was one of the first touristy places in Florida . Tourists have been flocking here since 1878 , mainly for the crystal clear waters and the exotic nature around the system of springs , which consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back towards the coast and stop in Crystal River , the largest wintering grounds for manatees in all of Florida . The kitschiest stop would be Weeki Wachee Springs State Park , where , in addition to wildlife ( mainly reptiles &amp; birds ) , you can watch the popular mermaid show . <p> Essential stops : Do n't miss the view over Tallahassee from the Florida State Capitol , the glass bottom boat tour and the river boat tour in Wakulla Springs ( or enjoy the 9 miles of trails there , if you enjoy hiking ) for wildlife ( alligators , birds , turtles ) and the seven mile road to an 1829 lighthouse in St Marks Wildlife Refuge . <p> Definitely visit the Manatee Springs State Park where you can swim with manatees and take a glass bottom boat tour in Silver Springs . If you 're an art lover , do n't miss the Appleton Museum Of Art near Silver Springs . Between January and March you can snorkel with up to 200 manatees in Crystal River . More manatees and other wildlife can be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River . <p> Detour : Drive about two hours west of Wakulla Springs to St George Island with nine miles of unspoiled sandy beaches . A big part of the island is a designated state park with miles of hiking trails . You can also cycle the entire length of the island . You can also take a detour between St Marks and Manatee Springs Park through the coastal area of Big Bend through small , sleepy coastal villages . <h> 2 The Florida Keys : Tropical Paradise <p> The Florida Keys , an archipelago of over 1,700 islands , is probably the most spectacular road trip in Florida . Highway 1 , also known as the Overseas Highway ' down here , runs 113 miles from mainland Florida all the way down to Key West , the southernmost point of the continental U.S. , and only 90 miles north of Cuba ! The views over the ocean ( the Atlantic to the left , the Gulf Of Mexico to the right ) are magnificent , with the color of the water constantly changing from one shade of blue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , making you feel like you 're floating above the water , and the Seven Mile Bridge in the Lower Keys is an architectural masterpiece . <p> If you start in Miami , the entire drive is about 164 miles long , taking about 3.5 hours at a leisurely driving pace . <p> Essential stops:If you want an extravagant adventure along the way , splurge and stay at the underwater hotel in Key Largo , Jules Undersea Lodge , which is only accessible via scuba diving ! It 's a little pricey ( $800 per night for two people ) , but an absolutely unique experience . <p> The Bahia Honda State Park , about three quarters of the way along the Oversea Highway on the way to Key West , is one of the most pristine beaches in the Keys . Pack your bikini and your snorkeling equipment ! Do n't miss the Better Than Sex dessert restaurant in Key West " the decadent sweet treats here are out of this world ! And of course eat as much key lime pie as you can handle . Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pies In The Keys as a guide . <p> Detour : If you have a time for a detour , add the Everglades National Park to your itinerary . The turnoff to the National Park is just outside of Homestead ( 35 miles south of Miami / 127 miles north of Key West ) . The Everglades , a UNESCO World Heritage Site , are one of the most magnificent places in Florida to spot wildlife " you are likely to see alligators , herons , cormorants , garfish , bass , turtles , deer , stilts , bitterns , limpkins , purple gallinules , roseate spoonbills , ibis , wood stork , Everglades kites , and if you are truly lucky , a Florida Panther . <h> 3 Beach Hopping From Jacksonville To Miami <p> Going all the way from Jacksonville near the border with Georgia in the north to Miami in the south ( or vice versa ) , Highway A1A is not only one of the most scenic drives in Florida , but in the entire nation . The road follows the Atlantic , always as close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacksonville , your first stop will be St Augustine , the oldest town in the U.S. , which is well worth a stop not only for its historic significance but also for its beautiful beach . From here , make sure to follow the A1A Scenic &amp; Historic Coastal Byway all the way down to Flagler Beach and be prepared to pull over frequently to take pictures . Your next stop will be Daytona Beach , where you can buy a beach day pass for only $5 , where the boardwalk and arcades make for a fun day on the coast . From there , head to Cape Canaveral to get closer to NASA than you can anywhere else on the planet , or take a detour to Orlando ( see Detour ' below ) .

Detour:If you 're a theme park fan , take a detour to Orlando from Daytona Beach before heading back to the coast to Cape Canaveral . It 's only a short drive inland , and in Orlando you can unleash your inner child at Disney 's Magic Kingdom , the Wizarding World of Harry Potter , Legoland , Epcot Center , or the brand new water park , Volcano Bay . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

This archipelago- of 20 islands , 42 islets , and over 250 rocks in the ocean , a 2-hour flight of the coast off mainland Ecuador , is a nature and wildlife lovers paradise ! For four days , we cruised around some of the islands , with frequent snorkeling stops and island explorations . The boat would anchor in the ocean , and our dinghies would bring us to the shore . With the exception of one island , Santa Cruz , we never encountered any other people , it always felt like we were the only ones out there . Even when the boat was cruising in between islands , we often did n't  see another boat for hours . <p> The snorkeling stops were my favorite part we swam with penguins , sharks , rays , seals and turtles . Something I never tire of ! On land , we watched Giant Tortoises mating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the ports of the two towns we stopped in , and we watched hundreds of colorful Sally Lightfoot Crabs crawling around the rocks near the shore .

@@107143048 @2543048/ <h> Where to stay in Kandy , Sri Lanka : Theva Residency <p> First of all , I have to admit that I was n't the biggest fan of Kandy . The Temple of the Tooth Relic , a UNESCO World Heritage Site , sure is remarkable , and so is the- Bahirawakanda Vihara Buddha Statue that towers over the city on the Bahirawakanda hilltop , but the city itself did n't  impress me much . However , I think these are reasons enough to visit Kandy and it is also conveniently located to break up the journey from Colombo to either the cultural triangle or the tea country " for both of which you 'll have to pass through Kandy anyway.The views from the Big Buddha show what Kandy is really about though : lush green mountains dotted with little houses along the mountainsides , valley views and a cool mountain breeze , which feels wonderfully refreshing after the scorching heat of Colombo and the south coast.Since it was all about these hills for me , I knew it would make sense to stay high up over the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vistas over the town far below in the valley instead.So when I found Theva Residency , I did n't  have to think twice this is where I would want to spend the night . Perched to the side of a mountain high above Kandy , the small boutique hotel comes with an infinity pool that allows you to lose yourself on the gorgeous views over the Hantana mountain range , an exquisite restaurant that allures with said views ( at night , when everything is lit up , there is a completely different feel to it ) to have dinner on the terrace , and cozy rooms that are also , you 've guessed it , all about the views.The minivan that had picked me and my two fellow travelers up at the train station took us higher and higher up on the mountain , one slope after the other , aching under the weight of our luggage . After about 15 minutes uphill driving , I could see the large glass windows that make this modern , airy hotel what it is : a place that takes advantage of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A few minutes later , we walked into the tastefully designed restaurant which comes with a large outdoor terrace , but does n't  require you to sit outside to take in the valley from up here : top to bottom glass windows cover the indoor areas of the restaurant . After the typical Sri Lankan welcome ceremony with cold wet towels and a refreshing fruit juice , we settled into our room , designed in minimal chic style , also outfitted with large windows . Situated right above the infinity pool , I was tempted to jump into the dark blue water straight from here.All rooms come with their own individual stylish design , local artists paintings on the wall and a bathroom that boasts a powerful rain shower . The penthouse suite and the superior rooms have a Jacuzzi , and the superior rooms in-room Jacuzzi right by the window had me think that this would be the perfect place for a romantic getaway , on a honeymoon tour of Sri Lanka for example . <p> Speaking of a romantic getaway I was lucky enough to peek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed . The living room , surrounded by panoramic top-to-bottom glass windows on three sides , offers spectacular views over the valley , and I could see how the jacuzzi , lit up by candles , would provide the perfect setting for the start to a romantic eveningNo matter if a superior balcony room or a standard deluxe room " what they all have in common is the attention to detail when it comes to decor , art and design . You can truly feel how much thought has put into furnishing and outfitting each and every room of Theva Residency.Each room comes with tea and coffee making facilities , which allowed us to have a cup of tea straight from the neighboring tea country with the sweet treat that had been left to welcome us in our room . Sitting by the open window and looking out over the lush green hills while sipping on a cuppa and devouring the delicious home-made cookies made for a wonderful break before an afternoon of sightseeing.The hotel is small with only 15 rooms ( 1 penthouse , 3 3uites , 7 superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate , and so did the dimly lit restaurant when we arrived there for dinner later that night . I was told that the chefs here are all masters of their art , and took great pride in presentation of the Asian and international dishes . And our dishes did not disappoint . <p> We started with a pumpkin cream soup served in a loaf of bread , followed by a lemongrass sorbet as a palate cleanser . My main dish , a vegetable lasagna , could have been straight out of Italy and the breaded eggplant right out of New York City . My fellow diners also enjoyed the fresh fish and chicken dishes they ordered.Passion fruit cheesecake and a chocolate mousse for dessert rounded our dining experience in fact , we were still stuffed from this divine meal when we went down for breakfast the next morning but we could n't resist the scrumptious and generous breakfast . <p> Breakfast is presented just as tasteful as dinner the night before , and so much more than we could possibly finish : fresh fruit juice and a fruit plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breads and pastries , served with jams , all served with tea or a plunger of coffee.My only regret is that I could n't stay another night " I did n't have near enough time to simply relax by the pool , enjoy a glass of wine on the terrace or take advantage of the Jacuzzi in my room . <h> Standout features <p> The location <p> For me , the location was one of the best features of the hotel . I loved being high up in the mountains and how well Theva Residency integrated its prime real estate into all rooms , designing the hotel in a way that allowed for sweeping views from everywhere , no matter where in the hotel you are . The terrace by the pool , the restaurant and its large terrace , the rooms " the views are outstanding from everywhere . <p> I also loved being far above the hustle and bustle of Kandy , which felt miles away , but still in reality , I could be in the town center in 15 minutes . <p> The restaurant <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be had anywhere else in Kandy , but the Theva restaurant , which can also be visited by non-guests , makes for a gorgeous , classy and elegant night out . Everything here is done just right , from aperitifs to digestives , starters to desserts , palate cleansers and wine selection " plus its wonderful setting in the mountains , with lights sparkling everywhere at night . <h> Room for improvement <p> To be honest , I have had a very hard time trying to think of something that could be improved . There was nothing during my short stay that I thought could use improvement , so I just suggest that Theva Residency keeps up the high quality service and maintenance of the rooms which should always be in a perfect condition , considering the steep price tag of the rooms . <h> Details <p> Free wifi , pickup service from the train station , tea and coffee making facilities in the room , breakfast included in the room rate , infinity pool , superior rooms come with jacuzzi , restaurant with terrace and full bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hantana , KandyPrice:Starting at $126 per deluxe room per night , $157 per superior room , $253 per suite per night ( prices vary depending on season ) LGBT Friendly : YesDigital Nomad Friendly:YesAmenities : Free wifi , pickup service from the train station , tea and coffee making facilities in the room , breakfast included in the room rate , infinity pool , superior rooms come with jacuzzi , satellite TV , air con , restaurant with terrace and full bar.Website:Theva.lk or you can follow Theva Residency on Facebook 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

I spent most of my time in Berlin since getting here , but I left in between and also visited family and friends in Leipzig and Erfurt . <h> What Ive been up to <p> I feel like Ive done so many things this month that its hard to believe I fit them all into only 30 days . <p> I started with hitting up- some of- my favorite places in New York City , where I enjoyed the beautiful summer weather with runs in prospect park and Central Park , bike rides through Brooklyn , a street art tour of Bushwick , and all my favorite foods . <p> In Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second one is due to arrive tomorrow morning ! ) , which was of course the perfect opportunity to show off all the spots that I think make Berlin special , like the remaining part of the Berlin Wall , now filled with street art and murals , Tempelhof , previously an airport , now a massive urban park , the Turkish Market in Maybachufer , Mauerpark for the Sunday flea market and karaoke , Sonnenallee with its many cheap middle eastern eateries , Kreuzberg with its street art and quirky cafes . While this first visit was focused on seeing as much of Berlin as possible , I think my second time showing friends around will be more about going out , exploring Berlins nightlife and craft brew scene . <p> In between my trips to Berlin , I spent time with my nephew , I surprised friends in my hometown ( this was an unplanned visit after all two months ago I was still expecting to spend the whole summer in New York ) , I took my nieces to the lake , took my beloved Odie ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed cooking and wine sessions with my sister-in-law and spoiled my family by cooking and baking for them.I also decided to finally deal with the remaining stuff from my last apartment a dozen moving boxes stored in my mothers house . These boxes had been there since I left London in 2010 and most of them had never been opened for over six years now ! A look through them and a major clean-out session were long overdue . I am giving away most of our stuff ( I lived in an apartment with my girlfriend at the time for three years most of the things are items we shared ) like kitchen stuff which I brought up to Berlin for a friend who is moving into a new apartment today . Refugee help centers will get most of the clothes and bedding stuff , and well see what I can do with the rest , but after six years of not touching any of it , its safe to say that I 'm probably not going to use any of it again . That said there are still quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <h> Highlights <p> Celebrity spottings <p> Well , I do n't  think a lot of people would get excited about these celebrities , but in New York I saw two people whose work I deeply appreciate ( and who could n't be more different from one another ! ) . And I would be surprised if you knew them ( if you do , please tell me in the comments ! ) . First I saw Dominique Ansel , who is a celebrity baker raised to fame when he invented the famous cronut . Yup , a baker got me so excited that I acted like a teenager while I was munching on a scrumptious Nutella chocolate swirl croissant in one of his bakeries , Dominique Ansel Kitchen , while he was there too . <p> Hello there , chocolate nutella swirl croissant ! <p> The other celeb spotting had me even more star struck while my friend and I were marveling at the street art in Bushwick , I saw a guy working on a new giant mural I did n't  even need to think about who it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

And so I was excited when during my last visit a housesit popped up right in the neighborhood I was staying in . I applied right away and heard back from the owners a few hours later . The next morning , I walked over there and met them , and less than a week later I moved in with two adorable cats .

This month , I was relying on public transportation instead and so I was thrilled when my friend and I rented bikes for a day and cycled all over Berlin . I know the bike lanes so much better than the subway or bus system ! <h> Lowlights <p> First of all I want to say that while a few things werent great over the past few weeks , overall , June was a month without any major incidents the first time this year that this happened ! <p> Website redesign <p> I finally tackled something that had been looming over me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that I kept pushing back because I knew it would n't go smoothly .

@@107143053 @2543053/ <h> Why you should visit Istanbul now <p> Istanbul and I 've had a long lasting love affair thinking about it , the longest I 've had with any city in the world ! Ever since I went to Istanbul for the first time , all the way back in 1998 , I 've been in love with this city that is unlike any other city in the world.Where the East meets the West , they say about Istanbul , and while it might sound like such a cliche , there 's no saying that describes Istanbul better than this . The complex , cosmopolitan city , divided by the Bosporus , sits partially on the European continent and partially on the Asian continent and offers such a rich and at the same time diverse cultural experience , so many historic sights and hidden gems that you could easily spend a month here without getting bored . That 's what I always wanted to do , by the way , spend an entire month in Istanbul to soak up all the history , culture , art , food and vibrant energy the city has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it.I did , however , managed to fit in a short visit to Turkey last year , which only reaffirmed my love for this magnificent city . If you are apprehensive about visiting Turkey at the moment because of the recent political turmoil , I say : do n't  be afraid ! Istanbul is much safer than the media makes us believe , and youll miss out on a very special and unique travel experience if you let fear hold you back from traveling to Turkey now . Turkey is still the sixth most visited country in the world who wouldve thought , right ? If you need more convincing , here are my top reasons to visit Istanbul now : <h> The history and architecture <p> Istanbuls mosques alone are worth spending hours in , with its graceful minarets and imposing domes , and of course the impressive interiors , especially the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia need to be seen from the inside , not just from the outside . Another architecturally remarkable structure ? The Topkapi Palace , dating back to the Ottoman era . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the major tourist sights . Seek out a few of Istanbul 's off-the-beaten-track monuments as well , for example the small Beylerbeyi Palace , which is located on the Asian side and gives you a perfect excuse to head over there.But Istanbuls architecture goes so much further with its many remnants from Byzantine , ottoman and Roman times . This fascinating and eclectic mix of cultures combined with the modern , contemporary Istanbul makes it a remarkable playground of cultures , of new and old , of different religious groups . <p> Thanks to its hilly layout , there are plenty of viewpoints from where breathtaking vistas over the Bosphorus can be enjoyed , and its geographic location , with several neighborhoods surrounded /divided by water , already makes it a stunningly beautiful city . Add to that the striking mosques , the Old City ( UNESCO World Heritage ) and captivating sights such as the massive underground vault of the Basilica Cistern , and you realize that this truly is one of the most intriguing cities in the world . <h> Culinary delights <p> The fusion of Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culinary experience that is unrivaled . The food in Istanbul is one of the things that makes me come back , especially the expensive mezze spreads which consist of hot and cold salads and various dips and sauces to dunk the delicious bread in . <p> For one you have a vast street scene with pomegranate juice and chestnuts on seemingly every corner , the tea guys who charge pennies for a small glass of the beloved Turkish tea . Then there are the baked goods , simit , comparable to a sesame bagel , but slimmer , and baklava , the sticky pastries , always oozing with honey , and highly addictive.Kebabs , pide , borek and falafel are cheap street foods that you find in little hole-in-the-wall cafes all over the city , and even though they do n't  look like much , their tastiness will stick with you for a long time . <p> And in addition to its street food scene , Istanbul has a thriving culinary scene with a growing number of upscale restaurants that put a modern twist on traditional dishes . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly recommend taking a culinary tour . To combine great views with tasty food , I recommend 7 Oceans for example , located in the Old City and with unbeatable vistas over the Bosporus . <h> The contrasts <p> One aspect that makes Istanbul so interesting are the contrasts you find here : contrasts between modern and traditional Turkey , in which hipster coffee shops coexist with fishermen who go walk down to the Galata Bridge morning after morning where they set up their fishing rods for the day . The contrast between the ancient mosques and the new bright skyscrapers , the women in their traditional burkas and young girls in skinny jeans and high heels.The contrasts do not end here the Asian side differs dramatically from the European side , and all of the citys neighborhoods have their own character : there 's bohemian Cihangir for example , posh Besiktas , and fancy Nisantasi with its distinct European flair . <h> The hospitality of the Turks <p> This is something I have to include because the more I travel , the more I realize that this is n't something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big cities in the world , say London , Rome or New York , you 'll know what I mean when I say it is exceptional to be made felt welcome , always greeted with a smiling face , an invite for a glass of apple tea , and helpfulness that is earnest . In Istanbul you wo n't find taxi drivers that rip you off like in Bangkok or people who avoid eye contact just so they do n't  have to talk to you like in Berlin . Here , people are incredibly proud to show you their city , their country , their culture . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107143055 @2543055/ <h> 33 Things We Love About Santiago de Chile <p> We spent nearly two months in Santiago and came to love it more with every day that passed . There are certainly more than only 33 things to love about Chiles capital , but we wanted to share the 33 most memorable things that made Santiago so special for us : <p> 1 Santiagos subway art <p> We mentioned this in our- Polaroid of the week- series and there 's a good reason were bringing it up again here . Santiagos subway stations each have their own art throughout murals , sculptures , paintings and contemporary design . <p> 2 Work out machines <p> We took back our health and wellness in our Santiago condo , but even without the spacious three-bedroom housesit , staying fit would have been possible on the many workout machines found throughout the citys green spaces . <p> 3 Dog houses <p> Seeing stray dogs in the streets is always heartbreaking , no matter where we travel . Santiago was one of the few places where we did n't  immediately want to rescue them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who pet them and give them love , but the city even provides them with doghouses in the parks . <p> 4 Mote con huesillo <p> This typical Chilean drink might be too sweet for some , but I found it refreshing after hiking up to Cerro San Cristobal for an hour in the sweltering summer heat . Mote con Huesillo is a strange drink that consists of dried peaches and cooked wheat in sweet tea which is not drunk but eaten with a spoon . <p> 5 The cemetery <p> Santiagos Cementerio General turned out to be one of the most impressive cemeteries we have ever visited . Filled with grand mausoleums , ornate graves , obelisks and statues , it is one of South Americas largest cemeteries with nearly 2 million burials including President Salvador Allendes massive family mausoleum . <p> 6 The Andes mountains surrounding the city <p> We loved seeing mountains on almost all sides around Santiago . Not sure if it is because both of us are from flat places , but seeing the snow-capped peaks of the Andes never got old . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prettiest neighborhoods : grand , beautifully restored buildings mixed with colonial charm with restaurants and cafes spilling out on the sidewalks . We loved wandering through the streets here , especially during our Foto Ruta photography Tour , which allowed us to zoom in on the little details throughout the neighborhood . <p> 9 Swimming pools with a view <p> There are two public swimming pools in Parque Metropolitano that have some of the best vistas of Santiago : Piscina Antilen and Piscina Tupahue . You can hike to the latter one from the Cerro San Cristobal viewpoint and be rewarded with a refreshing experience ! <p> This French bakery and restaurant is by far our favorite eatery in Santiago. - Admittedly- not exactly Chilean cuisine , Le Fournil set out to bake the best bread in Chile and we say , Mission Accomplished the breads , pastries and full breakfasts are to die for . <p> This famous fleahouse is the perfect introduction to Chilean drinking culture . The bar is known for its notorious terremotos , which means earthquakes , which are half liter cups filled with Pipe+o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fernet ( a strong herbal liquor ) . Headaches are guaranteed on Saturday mornings , but the Friday night atmosphere packed with locals provides a true South American experience . <p> Buenos Aires has an- amazing street art scene , and coming from there to Santiago , we werent sure- how this capital would compare . Even though the city has such a different vibe , street art here is gorgeous , intelligent and everywhere ! The best neighborhood to spot the most street art is Bellavista . <p> 14 The old-fashioned phone booths <p> Even though most of the phone booths are understandably out of order , they make gorgeous little spots to take cover from the rain around the city . <p> 15 Peluqueria Francesa <p> This traditional 19th century barber shop is still up and running , as retro as it is functional , and the restaurant of the same name right next store pays tribute with antique memorabilia that fits with the barber shop theme . <p> 16 Fresh watermelon everywhere <p> We loved the pop-up stalls on the side of the roads during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to carry an entire watermelon , you can just get fresh cut-up pieces . <p> In contrast to boring steel and glass blocks of financial districts around the world , Santiago takes serious pride in expressing their booming economy and optimistic future through its architecture . The countrys best architects have been called upon to create such unique skyscrapers , office towers and downtown hotels . <p> 18 Free walking tours <p> We mentioned it before Santiago is not exactly filled with tourist attractions , but there are three different free walking tour companies in the city that operate entirely on a tipping basis and let you choose between a total of five different walking tours ! Santiago might not have as many tourists as other South American destinations , but the ones that come and visit can get a great tour with only few people and an insightful local guide . Nobody should miss going on one , as we suggest in our quick guide to Santiago . <p> 19 The traditional pharmacies <p> Where can you still find pharmacies like this nowadays ? ! <p> 20 Fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning when the trucks with the days catch and witness an intense commotion , or wait to dine on fresh seafood in the cute restaurants right in the market later in the day . <p> This park have free sun chairs and umbrellas , wide green spaces , flamingos swimming in the pond and is one of the most fun outdoor spaces in the city . By far our favorite park , we spent many afternoons here with the puppies in our care , and which is why we recommend heading here if you want to go beyond central Santiago . <p> 23 The views from Cerro San Cristobal <p> While Cerro Santa Lucia , the other famous Santiago viewpoint , might be considered the prettier one , San Cristobal has the better views . From here you see how spread out Santiago is , and with the Andes in the background , we always felt like we were in such a special place . <p> 24- Resale shops on Bandera Street <p> When we heard about the second-hand stores on Bandera Street , we did n't  think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we found was loads of - stores selling quality clothes , leather jackets , business suits , handbags and shoes all of which fit non-Latina body shapes ! <p> 25 Pizza machines in the subway stations <p> We are not sure about the quality of these pizzas ( yeah we are , its probably not that good ! ) , but just having the option to throw money in the slot , click on the toppings that you want and hold a steaming pizza in your hands three minutes later is probably amazing after a night out . <p> 26 Sunsets with a mountain backdrop <p> We were ooh-ing and aah-ing almost every night when the sun set and the sky started to turn orange , purple and finally dark blue . We highly recommend to visit one of the many hotel rooftop bars- or the Cerro Santa Lucia or San Cristobal lookouts if skies are clear . <p> 27 Fruit and vegetable vendors <p> Even though there are plenty of big supermarkets well stocked with fruits and vegetables , the city is filled with fresh fruit and veg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple fruit and vegetable vendors selling their produce from their own personal carts around town . <p> 28 Bike friendliness <p> Santiago has surprisingly many bike lanes , called- ciclovias , which are usually lined with trees , have space for joggers as well and run for miles across the city . <p> 29 Strawberries in January <p> We were lucky enough to be in town for strawberry season , and when it hit , it seemed like there were strawberries for sale everywhere in town , for as little as $1 per kilo ! The strawberries are all natural and taste like strawberries of old , how they are supposed to taste . We devoured so , so many kilos . <p> 30 The nightlife in Bellavista <p> Bellavista is the place to be on a Saturday night the bars , pubs and clubs around Pio Nono street are bursting with cheap booze deals . We loved the atmosphere especially on warm summer nights when most of the parties spilled out onto the streets . <p> 31 El Huerto the best vegetarian restaurant in Santiago <p> While Buenos Aires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santiago it was harder to come by decent vegetarian food . Luckily we made our way to El Huerto ( which is nowhere near anything we wanted to visit ) , as it turned out to be our favorite vegetarian restaurant in town . <p> 32 The contrast in the architecture <p> The contrast between the typical colonial houses , and the glass towers in Providencia and traditional German half-timbered houses show Santiago societys many sides . <p> 33 Pedals an the art of multi-tasking . <p> Sure you could just enjoy a rest on a park bench , but why not combine that with a lower body workout ? ! We love these little foot pedals you find in front of many benches throughout the city and took advantage whenever we could. - Have you been to Santiago ? What are your favorite things about the city ? Share in the comments below 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Great list ! Would love to try the coffee with legs or the terremoto . As for the dog houses , its an interesting idea . Lima has tons of stray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be great to see them have some sort of temporary shelter . <p> Kayla I hope you 'll make it to Santiago one day ! I had no idea that Lima had lots of stray cats , thanks for letting me know I am obsessed with cats , and since were en route to Lima , I will make sure to buy them some snacks when we get there = <p> I was sold after Mote con huesillo that looks delicious ! A great round up of reasons to visit Santiago de Chile , I 'm itching to explore we 've been following your stay in the country and are super excited to plan our own Chilean adventure . <p> With all that gym equipment scattered around the city there 's no wonder all the girls have their legs out ! They clearly want to show off their hard work ! <p> Those strawberries look amazing ! I like the look of the swimming pool too . I go to public pools when I 'm in NYC in summer and its one of my favorite " live like a local " things to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post as usual ! <p> Thanks so much ! Kate the strawberries were delicious ! I think we developed somewhat of a strawberry addiction while we were in Santiago = I am putting going to a public pool in NYC on my to-do-list for our summer in NYC ( itll happen one day , I am sure of it ; - ) ) <p> Hehe , yes we did ! But we had found a couple of really good pizza joints in Santiago we did n't  want to ruin our pizza experience = Although I have to admit , had we passed this machine after a night of drinking , we would have tried it for sure = Good thing that the subway only runs until 11pm = <p> Dani loves the mote con huesillo , for me the jury is still out based on being unconvinced about consistency . Theres wheat and dried peaches in a syrupy juice . I love that it exists and is EVERYwhere though . Its such a traditional drink , I find it funny to see businessmen drinking it wearing suits and talking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it more than we initially thought ! <p> Looking for information about Santiago and found your site . Love it and thanks for all the info . We will be in Santiago from June 6 to June 11 ( i know it is winter ) so looking for things to do for it will be our first time to be in Chile . Thanks , Pedro <p> Hi Pedro ! So glad this was useful for you ! We 'd love you to check back in with us and let us know how Santiago is in June , the dead of winter there . Much of what we loved was outdoors , so it will be interesting to see what you get up to . Have fun ! <p> I am also a total sucker for any city that is ringed by mountains . Whether its San Cristobal here in Mexico last week or Sarajevo last summer , just love it . Really hoping Julia and I can make it to Santiago soon . <p> I love that you thought of 33 things ! It just took me back to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , which obviously is n't as much as your couple of months there , but I noticed many of the things you 've pointed here . Coffee with legs ! ! Oh how crazy those Chileans are <p> Hi Girls ! I found your website after I saw you in the first page of a chilean national newspaper . First i had a look to your comment about the chilean food and finally got to scroll over all your post about Chile . I really liked what you write about Santiago , the cit where I live , and i have to thank you for giving me a refreshing view of my own town . <p> Hope you do n't  take to seariously the mean comments of my fellow countryman and keep the true good feelings about Chile deep in your hearts , <p> Hi Rik , thanks so much for your comment ! You live in a great city = And we even had some good food there = But seriously , we do love Chile and would love to return to see more of the country and re-visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of fans there with our article on Chilean food ! <p> Very nice ! Did you eat icecream in emporio de la rosa in lastarria ? Is artesanal and very good ! But becareful because it seems is made with tap wather and the wather here has a lot of minerals than can cause stomach ache if you are not use to it . <p> Where are those Dog Houses for stray dogs and those Pizza-vending-machines ? I have lived in Santiago de Chile 33 out of my 34 years of life , and never , EVER seen those . It seems like some Tourist Agency took you guys to the best spots . I know thw real Santiago : The lack of green , the grey sky , the poverty , the kids playing in fields of dust , the terrible Transantiago , Plaza de Armas , the smog , delinquency , etc . Chile has some awesome and beautiful places for turism , Santiago is NOT one of them . This city is dangerous , the real Santiago . <p> What lack of green ? There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cities of that size in South America . Parque Bustamente , Parque Araucano , OHiggins Park , Parque Bicentennario , Santa Lucia Hill , Parque Forestal and the giant Parque Metropolitano and these are just a few that spring to mind . I wont disagree on the poverty with you , but that 's an issue in many cities , not only in Santiago or in developing nations . And Santiago is doing exceptionally well , being the most developed city in the region . Just look at Vitacura , Las Condes and Barrio El Golf . Far from poor , no ? I spent two months in Santiago and had barely grey skies , as you can tell from my photos . Now for the smog that 's another issue . But that does n't  mean Santiagos not to love . How many cities in the world have a serious smog problem these days ? ! Should we all shun them because of it ? Transantiago ha , spend a day on the subway in New York City and then tell me again that Transantiago sucks . If you 'd take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines . The dog houses are in Parque Forestal , btw , and I saw initiatives like this throughout Chile . The grass is always greener somewhere , but trust me , there are much worse cities out there than Santiago . <p> Dani , You made great references about Santiago . Through your posts we can see your openness to understand places and also the local culture when visiting and touring the city . There are many , many beautiful places in Santiago , and -of course- there are others less attractive like any other city in the world . What is great from you , is that you have seen the city with an open spirit ( that 's the attitude when you are a traveler ) , that 's why you have not seen " ugly " places . A true travelers spirit keeps the good over the rest . From a Santiaguino who loves his city . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143056 @2543056/ <h> Polaroid Of The Week : A crisp fall day in Berlin <p> Confession : Whenever I spend time in Berlin , I tend to neglect the most central neighborhood , Mitte ( which translates to central ) . For me , Berlin is all about the neighborhoods outside of the tourist zone , I guess I could say that in New York its pretty much the same way . <p> But this time around , I decided to stay as central as possible to be able to walk to most of the Festival Of Lights installations and it turned out to be the perfect opportunity for me to explore this part of town a bit more . And what a great decision this was . It showed me that central Berlin has much more to offer than I initially thought especially when it comes to food . I discovered several excellent Vietnamese restaurants ( check out Madami , Pho Hoi , Good Morning Vietnam and Chen Che ) , had the best vegan burrito of my life ( the Vegan Lover at Dolores ) , and great coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaffeebar . <p> I also discovered that some of my favorite hang outs ( Kaschk for craft beer at night and coffee during the day , St Oberholz for a good work session , the new(ish) Barn Roastery for the best coffee in Berlin ) are in walking distance from Mitte , and so is Prenzlauer Berg with its countless cool bars and restaurants ) . And since I was planning to shop for a new wardrobe for my next destination ( I 'll share in my monthly round-up next week where I 'm going , but : any guesses ? ! ? ) , staying at Alexanderplatz turned out to be extremely convenient , with plenty of shopping nearby . <p> Of course I did n't  only stay in Mitte I caught up with a friend over lunch in Kreuzberg , wandered around Prenzlauer Berg for a photography project ( and randomly discovered the St. Marys and St. Nicholas cemetery where this weeks Polaroid was taken ) , and was taken on a fantastic wine bar hopping tour . I love that there 's always still so much new stuff for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised to see how many more places I keep adding to my places to check out list , even though I feel like I know the city quite well . ( Check out all my Berlin posts here ) . <p> I guess to make it through my list , I 'll have to eventually move to Berlin = For now though , I 've had enough time in Germany and its time to pack my backpack again . A few more days of quality time with my family , and I 'll be hitting the road again ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 5 Comments <p> Oh but then you have the perfect excuse to go on a fall foliage trip , Lauren = I skipped fall in 2010 but spent October 2011 in Chicago the perfect time to be there to see all the glorious fall colors !

@@107143057 @2543057/ <h> On the hunt for the best pizza in New York City <p> As you get older , you grow into certain foods " like my new love of artichokes or a preference for goat 's cheese and brie over bright orange cheddar . <p> But there are some foods you never grow out of . <p> In my case , this is pizza.You might remember me and Jess wandering around on the hunt for the best pizza in Buenos Aires a place that outsiders might not realize has its very own specific style of pizza . We make a point of eating pizza everywhere we go. - The thing is , in a city like New York , your pizza palate can really enjoy a range of styles , from basic slices to , well , artichokes and goats cheese ( but maybe not together ) . <p> So what 's the best pizza in New York City , you ask ? <p> I set off to find out . With two months housesitting in Brooklyn in 2013 , I assumed there was plenty of time to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , I began my research and found about fifteen places that people were raving about , and claiming that they had the best pizza in New York City I narrowed them down to these ten : <p> ( Note : Youll see reviews for a few restaurants below that are n't  listed above these are pizza places that I 've stumbled upon randomly or that I 've found out about later on : <p> Joes Pizza thumbs up ! <p> Don Antonios solid pizza <p> Best Pizza amazing <p> 089 very good <p> Forninos good pizza <p> Underground Pizza solid slice <p> Ribalta ( only ) - okay <p> One of my favorites : A glorious slice of White Pizza at Best Pizza in Williamsburg <p> I was determined to try them all . <h> Update 2015 : <p> After eating my way around New York Citys pizza places for two years , I feel like its time that I share my top five pizza places in New York with you . For more detailed reviews and opinions , see below , but if you 're only interested in finding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slice ( or a pie ) , I 'll save you the time and share my top 5 pizza places with you now : <p> Robertas <p> Artichoke Basille <p> Best Pizza <p> Keste <p> Paulie Gee <h> Update 2014 : <p> After spending another four months in New York City this year , I am happy to announce that the list has grown ! Some of these Ive made it to , some of these places are on the list for my next summer in New York ( I love summer in New York City , but I tend to stay away during the winter months ) . But the more time I spend in NYC , the more recommendations I get . <p> Because its New York City , we have to talk about the $1 slice , so let 's get that out of the way first . <h> The $1 slice <p> The first slice of New York pizza we had was actually from a $1 pizza place . It is impossible to resist the smell of fresh pizza and the price But I quickly learned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its good ( it also depends on your level of drunkenness , to be fair ) . Its hit or miss with a $1 slice , and to be sure , when in need of a $1 slice I always go to 2 Bros Pizza , which is my favorite slice chain in NYC . <p> Address : There are Dollar Pizza parlors all across New York . Check this map for a slice near you ! <p> Verdict : Excellent value for money . <h> Grimaldis <p> I continued our research ' with Grimaldi 's , one of the most famous coal brick-oven pizzerias in the city and just a five-minute walk from our Brooklyn Heights housesit . I 'd seen the crowds outside the restaurant on my runs , as there seem to be people waiting in front of Grimaldis as soon as they open and pretty much non-stop until they close , and one day we finally joined the long line of people waiting out front . Tourists flock here , so I wanted to see if the hype is worth it . <p> Brick ovens like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which results in especially crispy and flavorful pizzas . As any good pizza would do , we opted for the classic mozzarella and cheese to absorb and compare the true flavor quality The truth is , I expected a bit more considering the massive hype . If the line is n't too long and you happen to be in Brooklyn , stop in for some pretty good pizza " but it 's not the best.Tip:Patsy Grimaldi , the founder of Grimaldi 's , sold his pizzeria in 1998 . In 2012 , he actually opened a new pizzeria right next to the famous original " his new venture is called Juliana 's . It 's supposed to be much better than Grimaldi 's , but we did n't eat there ( yet ! ) . <p> Address : 1 Front Street , New York , NY 11201 <p> Verdict : If the line is n't too long and you happen to be in Brooklyn , stop in for some pretty good pizza " but it 's not the best . <h> Julianas <p> As mentioned above , Patsy Grimaldi opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold in 1998 . While the word about Julianas was n't out in 2013 when we lived five minutes from Grimaldis , it definitely was out in 2014 , when there was always a line out the door at Julianas . I had a pie of the classic Margherita ( $16 , enough to split between two hungry or three not-so-hungry people ) a couple of times and it always delivered . Definitely a notch up from Grimaldis so if you find the line at Grimaldis too long , why not try Julianas instead ( its cheaper , too ! ) ? Tip:If you want to skip the line , you can just order a pizza for pick-up and eat it in Brooklyn Bridge Park right down the road , that 's what I usually do . Nothing tastes like a New York slice like a slice with the view of the Manhattan skyline , trust me ! <p> Address : 19 Old Fulton St , Brooklyn , NY 11201 <p> Verdict : Definitely one of the best pizzas I 've had in New York City . Its worth the wait , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Paulie Gee 's was n't even on our list but when we made plans to meet a friend there for dinner and saw the menu , we were immediately intrigued . Unfortunately that day the wait was over 40 minutes so we skipped it , but we headed back to Greenpoint for a second go when another foodie friend was in town . <p> Greenpoint is quite out of the way , even for Brooklyn , but it is so worth the trip ! This is n't New York Style ' pizza " here you get innovative pizza creations that might sound strange at first , like the Cherry Jones " with cherries , gorgonzola , prosciutto and honey , there was one with fennel and anise , or vegan sausages with grapes . Paulie Gee 's gets extra points for awesome pizza names like Arugula Shmoogula , A Whiter Shade Of Kale or Ricotta Be Kiddin ' Me ! Tip:Paulie Gee 's also has a wide range of vegan pizzas ! Check out their menu here . <p> Address : 60 Greenpoint Ave , - New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're into trying unusual pizzas , make your way to Paulie Gee 's ! <h> Speeding up the hunt : Going on a pizza tour <p> While researching for our next quick three-day stay in New York , I stumbled on a pizza tour on Vimbly . Vimbly brings together almost all the tours you can take in New York " food tours , movie tours , walking tours , kayaking tours of the Hudson Riverand pizza tours ! <p> Less than 48 hours later , we were booked onto a pizza tour through four different neighborhoods with Scott , the biggest pizza aficionado we have ever met . Seriously . <p> I was already happy when I read that the meeting point for Scotts Pizza Tour was Lombardi 's , another pizzeria high on my list . <h> Lombardi 's <p> When you roll with Scott 's Pizza Tours , Scott gets you access that you could never otherwise get . For example , the first thing we did at Lombardi 's was peek into the kitchen at the incredible pizza oven . It was lunch time and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuously for years " they only put the coals out entirely when they do routine maintenance every decade or so . Once you really start to pay attention to the difference between flavors of a brick oven vs a regular gas oven , you 'll opt for brick oven every time . <p> Lombardi 's was one of the first pizza places in the U.S. , established in 1905 by Italian immigrants . It is indirectly responsible for the foundation of some of the best pizza places in New York : Anthony Pero of Totonnos , Patsy Lancieri of Patsys and John Sasso of John 's Pizza all learned under Gennaro Lombardi , the founder of Lombardi 's . We sat down at three tables set up just for us and tried the first of four pizza slices on the tour . It was fun to see Scott geek out over the fact that you could see the brick marks in the bottom of the crust . The pizza style is similar to Grimaldi 's , with melted slices of part-skim mozzarella covering the slice only partially . The sauce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Scott actually showed us a picture of him crawling inside that oven a few years ago ! <p> Tip:Come right at noon when they open to skip the line . We arrived just when they opened and it was still fairly quiet when we left 30 minutes later . <p> Address : 32 Spring St. , New York , NY 10012 <p> Verdict : Decent New York-style pizza , worthy of hype . <h> Patsy 's Pizza <p> We had been told by a few New York locals that Patsy 's in East Harlem was a must , so I was happy to discover that Scott 's Pizza Tour would include Patsy 's that day and I could check another pizzeria off my list ! Patsy 's is another one of the original Neapolitan style coal fired oven pizzerias . Different from Lombardi 's or Grimaldi 's though , the mozzarella cheese here covers the entire pie which makes the pizza super cheesy ( and delicious ! ) . <p> Tip:Every year in mid-August , Patsy 's celebrates its anniversary with Great Depression " era pricing : coal-oven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 10- . <p> Address : 2287 First Avenue , New York NY 10035 <p> Verdict : Well worth the trip up to East Harlem and possibly our favorite pizza on the tour . <h> Robertas <p> Robertas is hands down the best pizza I 've had in New York . There 's no question about that . Even though it is housed in what looks like a ramshackle building from the outside and is far out in Brooklyn , in Bushwick , it is so worth coming here ! I totally understand why Beyonce and Jay-Z eat here regularly I 'd eat here every week , if I could . Absolutely scrumptious ! Bonus : Compared to some of the other famous pizza places in NYC , Robertas $12 Margherita is an absolute steal ! <p> Tip : If you want to skip the lines , come here for lunch . If you do n't  want to make the trip out to Bushwick ( even though it is so worth it ! ) and you happen to find yourself in New York in May or September , you 're lucky . Robertas usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival in Madison Square ( right in front of the Flatiron Building ) . <p> Address:261 Moore St , Brooklyn , NY 11206 <p> Verdict : Best pizza in New York , Dani voted . Ignore all the other pizza places in this list , make a beeline straight for Robertas . Stop reading this list now . Hop on the L Train , get off at Morgan Ave and its less than two minutes from the subway . <h> Artichoke Basille <p> Artichoke Basille is another favorite of mine , especially their artichoke pizza . On this pizza , you basically have an artichoke spinach dip instead of a tomato-based pizza sauce , but if this sounds weird to you , hear me out : it is absolutely amazing . Seriously one of the best pizza inventions out there ! They have a number of other pizzas ( Margarita , Vodka , etc ) , and because they all look fantastic , I find myself ordering some of the other slices here every now and again , as well . Stick to the artichoke pizza though , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three branches in Manhattan ( plus one in Astoria , Queens ) . The East Village location is more like a hole-in-the-wall pick-up-a-slice place , while the Chelsea location is a full sit-down restaurant . Because of its location ( right by the Highline Park and one block from Chelsea Market ) , the Chelsea location can get busy , but prepared for lines in the Greenwich Village and East Village branches , too . <p> Verdict : The artichoke pizza is drool-worthy and one of my top five pizza slices in New York ! <h> Joes Pizza <p> Joes Pizza is a Greenwich institution , and perfectly located in midst of all the Village bars to lure you in after a drunken night out , to soak up some of that booze before you go to bed . Even though this is a 24-hour pizza slice parlor , its much more than a cure-your-hangover pizza place , it is probably the best slice you can get in the village . At $2.75 the margherita is slightly more expensive than a $1 slice , but so worth it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucy , and if you want a really really good slice , splurge on the $3.50 slice with fresh mozzarella . You 'll thank me later . <p> Tip:Dont miss a slice of Joes on a trip to New York ! <p> Address : 7 Carmine St , New York , NY10014 <p> Verdict : I cant think of a better cheese slice in New York City ! The only slice I 'd put above this is the artichoke pizza at Artichoke Bastille , but their cheese slice is n't anywhere near as good as Joes . <h> Bleecker Street Pizza <p> Bleecker Street Pizza would be my #2 slice in the Village , but has been named Best pizza in New York by the Food Network three years in the row . Since its only a 3-minute walk to Joes Bleecker Street location , you might as well try both and decide for yourself . Both have a long list of celebrity fans . I love the huge selection at Bleecker Streets , making it always hard for me to decide which one to go for ( or ending up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $3.50 , they 're more expensive than Joes and I am not sure that the higher price tag is justified . <p> Tip : Combine a visit to Bleecker Street Pizza with a visit to Joes and compare ! <p> Address : 9 7th Ave S , New York , NY 10014 <p> Verdict : One of New Yorks best slices . <h> Otto Zero Nove ( 089 ) <p> When I planned a trip to the true Little Italy of New York in the Bronx , not on the Lower East Side , where the touristy Manhattan Little Italy is located I started researching the best pizza place in the Arthur Avenue area right away . If there are true Italian restaurants here , there must be a true Naples-style pizza somewhere . My research led me to 089 , or Otto Zero Nove , and it did n't  disappoint . I opted for an unusual pizza choice : Pizza La Cirilo ( $16.95 ) , with butternut squash puree instead of a tomato-based pizza sauce , and topped with fresh mushrooms and fresh mozzarella , with truffle oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine ! <p> Tip:A solid choice if you are visiting the Bronx Little Italy . Many unusual pizzas on the menu ( with potato , butternut squash puree , etc ) , and all ingredients are imported from Italy . <p> Address:2357 Arthur Ave , Bronx , NY10458 <p> Verdict : Who wouldve thought that the pizza had such good Italian-style pizza ? Definitely worth visiting , would eat there again . <h> Forninos <p> Forninos is definitely not one of the most amazing pizza places in New York , but they make a decent pie and have a good lunch deal . Lunch , exactly . Because , their other problem is that they are in Williamsburg and in Greenpoint , and if you find yourself in Greenpoint at night , you should obviously go to Paulie Gees and if you find yourself in Williamsburg at night , you head to Best Pizza , no question . But if you are near one of their branches and you want to have a proper sit-down pizza lunch , its an excellent choice . I have only had the Margherita pizza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on trying the ricotta eggplant pizza . <p> Tip:Go for their lunch special : $12 for a pizza and a salad . Excellent value for money ! <p> Verdict : A decent Italian-style pizza and the lunch special is a fantastic bargain I mean , look at the size of the pizza ! <h> Best Pizza <p> To call your pizzeria simply Best when you 're way out on the edges of a city famous for its pizza " now that 's daring . Here , in the capital of pizza , Best Pizza is still much more underground ' than Underground Pizza mentioned above , that 's for sure . This well-kept secret only opened in 2010 , and is located a couple of blocks up from popular Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg . <p> Verdict : Was it the best ? We 'll let you decide " but definitely a must for pizza peeps who like more than just a classic cheese slice . <h> A note about Scott 's Pizza Tour <p> You know what the coolest thing about Scott 's Pizza Tour- is ? Beyond the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus - Queens , Brooklyn , Lower Manhattan and Harlem in under four hours and got to eat slices at places that normally only serve whole pies and you could n't eat four whole pizzas in a day could you ? ! And even cooler than backstage access inside the kitchens to learn possibly everything there is to know about making pizza and watching Scott use his own personal super high temperature pizza oven thermometer to test the actual temperatures of each of the pizza ovens . The best thing is that Scott goes to different pizza places each Sunday . This is a guy who samples pizza in nearby states on his days off , so of course he does n't want to get sick of placesif we wanted to do this tour again ( and again ) , odds are we would continue to cross places off my list . Not only that , but he also offers a Greenwich Village Pizza Walk " which we 'll probably join next time we 're in town , too ! <p> Tip : Come here for a nice dinner , Keste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialty pizzas that are pricier than your usual pizza worth it though , in my opinion . No slices , only full pies . <p> Address : 271 Bleecker St , New York , NY 10014 <p> Verdict : A proper Italian-style pizza in New York ! Perfect . <h> Totonno 's <p> Totonno 's is a Coney Island institution , having served pizza on Neptune Avenue since 1924 . This is another one of New York 's iconic coal fired brick oven pizzerias . Antonio " Totonno " Pero , the founder , worked at Lombardi 's first and once he had perfected his pizza-making skills , he decided to open his own place out in Coney Island . Totonno 's has n't changed their recipe since 1924 and is supposed to be one of the most quintessential New York pizzas , and hey , who does n't need to take the occasional trip out to Coney Island , anyway ? <p> Tip : Do n't  ask for the menu you can see all available pizzas on the board . Totonnos only does full-size pies , no slices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . It was a bit of a let-down , like the other much-hyped and Totonno-related Grimaldis , so I would n't make the way all the way out to Coney Island just to eat at Totonnos . If you 're planning to visit Coney Island anyway , for the amusement park or some beach time , then its well worth stopping here for a pizza . <p> Tip : Make sure to come early if you are planning to dine here because it gets packed at night you are in the Theater District after all . <p> Address:309 W 50th St , New York , NY 10019 <p> Verdict : Its solid enough to be included in this list , and I 've heard other people rave about it , plus it has very good reviews all over the interwebs . If you are not as much of a pizza snob as I am , you 'll probably enjoy it more than I did ( to clarify : I did enjoy it , but it would n't make my Top Ten list ) . <h> Di Faras <p> I was n't sure if I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artichoke Basille , where I always happily hand over a fiver ) , but since there are lines out the door at Di Faras ( with waiting times of up to 1 " 2 hours ) despite the price tag and the out-of-the-way location in Midwood , Brooklyn , I had to see f these slices lived up to the hype . Anthony Bourdain claims it 's the best of the best ' and Di Fara 's keeps winning Best Pizza of NYC ' awards by several food publications year after year . Domenico DiMarco , who opened the no-frills pizzeria in 1959 , takes pride in using only imported ingredients from Italy . <p> I finally made it to Di Faras in 2016 , and nearly died of hunger while waiting in line for about an hour for my slice . Had I known that I 'd be waiting that long , I wouldve ordered five slices . We tried the Sicilian style ( thick dough , baked in a pan ) as well as the regular pizza , and I thought both were perfect , but my friend found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Di Faras was voted Best Pizza in New York several times , by the likes of Zagat , Frommers , Anthony Bourdain and Mayor Bill DeBlasio . This pizza is worth the trek out to Midwood if you 're a true pizza lover ! <p> Address : 1424 Avenue J , Brooklyn NY 11230 <p> Verdict : Loved it ! But I would n't wait an hour again for a slice here . Unless I happen to be in the area maybe . <h> Underground Pizza <p> I admit , this place is nowhere to be found on any of the best slices in NYC ' lists , but if you are in the Financial District around Wall Street , in Battery Park or just returning from the Staten Island Ferry , Underground Pizza place is well worth a visit . <p> We had the eggplant parmigiano pizza on a couple of occasions , and it is so delicious . The classic Margarita style is also good , slices are start at $2.75 , and you can even get a breakfast slice with cheese , eggs and either bacon or sausage if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there early enough to try that just yet . <p> Tip : Because this is in the Financial District , skip lunch hours or you 'll get stuck in long lines . <p> Address : 3 Hanover Square , New York , NY 10004 <p> Verdict : The eggplant parmigiano pizza hits the spot . <h> The EndFor Now- <p> There you have it , my favorite pizza places in New York so far ! I will be updating this post every time I visit a new pizzeria in New York , so it just might be worth bookmarking this and checking back here as an ever-growing New York Pizza Resource . 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 36 Comments <p> I head back to NY in 4 months after 3 years of being away .

This past weekend I was thinking I needed to research pizza places for an upcoming trip to NYC ! On previous trips Ive tried Grimaldis and Luzzos ( which was great ! ) but I 've never had a really good pizza slice so these are some great places to check out ! Thanks ! <p> Cool fun fact about Totonno 's go there early because they do n't  have regular hours . Every day they make the dough fresh and once it has run out for the day , that 's it . They close again until the next day . <p> You forgot Joes Pizza in Greenwich Village ! We love that place . Leonardo DiCaprio is a fan too , apparently . They only use two ingredients on their slices cheese and tomato . Somehow this manages to taste amazing . Great post ! <p> Hi Carmen , Joes was actually #11 on my list but then I took it out for some reason ! Good to know that its worth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greenwich Village pizza walk next time were in New York to fit in as many places as possible = I am craving pizza ! ! <p> OMG , I love the look of the pizza bagels . I recently found the best pizza in Phnom Penh-aftr 2 years there ! It is a moto with a pizza oven on top and is called Katy Perris Pizza . Not only is the name awesome , but the pizza is delicious too . <p> Pizza bagels are amazing ! ! Try them next time you 're in the U.S. = Oh and good to know about that pizza place in Phnom Penh ! I am taking notes = Hope well get back there next year ! And I think the name is hilarious = <p> I 've tried out some of the places you mention . But I found my favorite by chance , just a couple of days ago : Savoia on Smith Street in Carroll Gardens , Brooklyn , I had Pizza Campagnola there , with wild mushrooms , sausage and Ricotta and it was awesome . <p> Spunto Thin Crust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On week days you can buy slices . I had the Salciccia Dolce and a costum designed pizza and they were both perfect . So you can get artichoke and goats cheese on the pizza if you choose to custom design one = Ive been there twice and it does n't  seem to be crowded . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Yes , I made an on-a-whim flight purchase a couple of weeks ago and changed my plans rather unexpected more on the reason behind that in my monthly round-up , but in short , I had the opportunity to meet up wit several friends here which was more enticing than continuing my travels through Colombia solo , and I 'm not one to say no to the prospect of Mexican food ! <p> So here I am again , my fourth time in Mexico , a country I love very much and can visit over and over again . Plus : there are still so many places I have n't been to yet anything north of Mexico City , for example .

Our first destination was El Tajin , the UNESCO-declared ruins of a pre-Columbian city in the state of Veracruz , which was one of the most significant cities of the classic era in Mesoamerica and peaked after the fall of Teothihuacan . From 600 to 1200 C.E. El Tajin was a prosperous city , and you can see the ruins of several temples , ball courts , palaces and pyramids here . What 's special about El Tajin is that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular yet brutal Mesoamerican ballgame pitz , and the Pyramid of the Niches , which has 365 symmetrically arranged square niches that create a constantly shifting play of light and shadow when the monument basks in sunshine . <p> From El Tajin , we headed to Cuetzalan , one of Mexicos famous pueblos magicos , or magical villages , and also a UNESCO World Heritage site . The pueblos magicos are 54 little Mexican towns that are considered special enough to be called magical and which range from tiny , unknown hamlets to bigger towns like the picture-perfect Valladolid , a place I fell in love with when I traveled around Mexico in 2010 ( and which I 'm excited to revisit next month ! ) . Cuetzalan did not disappoint , it was a cute little town nestled onto a hilltop in the mountains of Puebla that charmed us with cobble-stone streets , a town square lined with palm trees and an impressive church . <p> In addition to an adventurous caving tour during which we explored the Grutas de Cuetzalan , we visited another pre-Colombian town , this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not less striking ( see picture above ) .

In fact , most tourists only stop in town for the obligatory picture . Herds of cruisers and tour groups arrive in the morning , pretend to hold it up for a few minutes and then move on to Florence . <p> Let 's face it " if it were n't for the leaning tower , most people would skip Pisa entirely in favor of famous Florence , picturesque San Gimignano or the medieval flair of Siena or Lucca . <p> And that 's fine . Let the others skip this charming Tuscan town , so you can enjoy your time exploring beyond Campo dei Miracoli square , home to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. - If you do go beyond , you will find a bustling university city has plenty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spas , nearby beaches , and of course scrumptious Italian cuisine . <p> Campo dei Miracoli <p> While the Leaning Tower is not everything that Pisa has to offer , it ca n't be skipped ! Head to the Campo dei Miracoli and take the cheesy pictures , but take the time to take in the rest of this grand field as well : the Campo Dei Miracoli ( Miracle Square ) is home to the main religious monuments of Pisa , including its Cathedral , the stunning Baptistery and the graveyard that all date back to the 15th century . <p> The round Romanesque dome on the Square is the Baptistry , decorated with sculptures and paintings and visitors can climb into the dome . Stay for a while to hear the astonishing audio effect in the baptistery " the guard regularly comes inside and shouts a few sounds to demonstrate the acoustics , which makes regular shouts sound like music . <p> Tip : If you are planning to climb to the top of the tower , reserve your tickets in advance here to avoid the long waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued for a specific time and date . <p> The other significant building on the Piazza dei Miracoli is the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption , one of the most prestigious cathedrals in Italy , and a masterpiece of the era of the Florentine Renaissance . <p> The Composanto Monumentale , located at the northern edge of the square , is the city 's historical cemetery where noble citizens were buried . <p> Via Roma and Via Francesco Crispi <p> If you arrive by train , it is a thirty-minute walk along these two streets to the Campo dei Miracoli . Take the time to walk into the buildings , and at least peek into the shops , cafes and restaurants on the half-hour walk to the Leaning Tower . If you do n't arrive by train , make sure to walk these main shopping streets to take in the atmosphere of the university town .

You can climb the Torre Guelfa ( Guelph Tower ) to have a splendid view over Pisa , including the Leaning Tower , which is well worth the trip there . The Citadel was an important fortification from which ships were launched in the 13th century . This is an area of Pisa that most visitors do n't get to see at all . <p> Piazza dei Cavalieri <p> The Piazza dei Cavalieri , the Knights ' Square , is one of the most significant landmarks in Pisa , the second main square after the Campo dei Miracoli . In medieval times , this square was the town 's political center , and you can still see the remarkable historic buildings that surround the square. - On this plaza you 'll find the Palazzo della Carovana for example , with a magnificent fa+ade that was constructed during the Renaissance era , as well as the Palazzo dellOrologio ( Clock Palace ) , and the churches Chiesa di Santo Stefano and San Rocco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they call their beaches , and they are lined with umbrellas and sun chairs in the summer months .

If you have a sweet tooth ( even after the gelato and pastries ! ) do n't leave Pisa without trying the Torta co ' bischeri , a cake made of pine nuts , chestnuts and chocolate . <p> Tip : As a general rule , do n't eat anywhere around Campo dei Miracoli , which is surrounded by mediocre tourist traps . The San Martino neighborhood south of the River Arno has several inexpensive , authentic restaurants for example ( many are right on Via San Martino ) , or the above mentioned Piazza Delle Vettovaglie . <p> Relax in a spa <p> Like several other Tuscan towns , Pisa has some thermal water which has been used for health benefits for hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casciana Terme , which in addition to thermal water also offers a wide range of rehabilitation therapies , and San Giuliano Terme , which has several springs , including one that has calciferous magnesic sulfate water , naturally rich in vital curative elements . <p> Tips for visiting Pisa <p> Pisa is well-connected to other cities in Tuscany and has much cheaper accommodation than Florence or Siena .

Sadly , I did n't have time to extend my time in Europe because I had already booked a flight to Seattle , where I just arrived and will be spending all of- October . <h> Life Lately <p> I had ambitious plans for my time in Southern California " from trips along to the Pacific Coast Highway to canyon hikes , L.A. neighborhood explorations , museums , side trips to San Diego and Joshua Tree but as so often , I barely crossed half of these things off of my to-do-list . Especially once the Italy trip got confirmed , during which I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to get as much work done as possible so that I could head to Europe without feeling I 'd be drowning in work upon my return to the U.S. I had to scrap my trips to San Diego and Joshua Tree , two things I 'd been very much looking forward to ( especially Joshua Tree where I have n't been yet ) , but I have a feeling this wo n't be my last time in Southern California , so I 'm not too upset about that.The trip to Italy did n't get 100% confirmed until the week before I boarded my plane to Rome , but turned out to be a dream trip . I was able to walk parts of the historic Via Amerina which leads from Assisi to Rome and is one of five major pilgrims ' routes in Italy . The path ends " of course " at St Peter 's Basilica- in Vatican City where we arrived on Wednesday in time for the Pope 's weekly audience . I will talk about the trip throughout this round-up but ca n't wait to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month.Let 's take a quick look about what went right and what went wrong this month <h> Highlights <p> Walking through Italy <p> You might have noticed that I love multi-day treks : in the past couple of years I walked the 5-day Salkantay Trek to Machu Picchu , I walked the National Trail in Israel , and this year the 4-day jungle &amp; mountain trek to the Lost City in Colombia . While I have n't managed to find time to walk the Camino de Santiago ( a 3-week trek through Northern Spain ) this year , I managed to make time for a 5-day walk through Italy 's Umbria and Lazio regions . The trip ended up exceeding my expectations by far , with 15-20- kilometer of walking per day through Italy 's picturesque countryside , followed by afternoon explorations of quaint little towns and gorging on scrumptious Italian food ( and wines ) . My group of international hikers ( Britain , Italy , Germany , Poland , Portugal and China were represented ) got along great , and I got to know a region of Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final thought : I went on an epic hike in September 2014 , now the great hike in Italy in September 2016 " does this mean that in September 2018 I 'll be finally walking the Camino ? = <p> Returning to Rome <p> I had n't been to Rome in years , and finishing the walk in a city I love was the icing on the cake . My only regret is that I did n't have more- time " ideally I would 've liked to spend at least a full week- there- " but I tried to make the most of the full day I had in Rome and vouched to be back soon . I had n't been to Rome since I started traveling full-time and was n't sure if I 'd still be as impressed by the city as I 'd been on my previous three visits ( which all happened before I got to know remarkable cities like New York , Buenos Aires or Hong Kong ) , but yes : Rome did n't fail to impress me , even the fourth time around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right next to more modern , yet distinctively Italian architecture , and the historic significance of Rome make it exceptional- in a way no other city compares to . <p> Driving the Pacific Coast Highway ( again ) <p> While I did n't get around to drive up to San Francisco again ( which I did in 2010 ) , I did get around to drive the southern part again " not all the way to San Diego , but to Newport Beach . I 've already raved about that trip in my Polaroid of the week , so I wo n't bore you again with how much I love Southern California , but I felt truly blessed that I was able to do this coastal drive not just once in my life , but twice ( and I have a feeling I might be able to do it a third time ! ) <p> The hike to the Hollywood Sign <p> Another thing I 've already raved about in a Polaroid of the week , but this was one of the top three things I really wanted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other two being Joshua Tree , which I did n't get around to , and exploring Silver Lake , which I did do and wrote about here ) .

Once again I could n't be more grateful for this little website and where it led me , and to the people I met through it . And then there was my hiking group which I 've mentioned before was fantastic , and I am sure that I will see several of my fellow hikers again . <p> Dog love <p> After being bitten by the dog I was dog sitting last month , I was somewhat afraid of Henry , my friend 's dog I was looking after in Long Beach .

@@107143068 @2543068/ <h> Hotel Tip of the Week : Hosteria Yendegaia Porvenir , Chile <p> During the 1980s , the last sign on the way out of Porvenir said simply , " El ultimo apaga la luz . " <p> If you 're the last to go , turn off the light . <p> So much of the population of this small Chilean town fled to the Argentine side of Tierra del Fuego in search of work during that time , Porvenir could easily have become a ghost town . Not everyone left , however , and three decades later there are roughly 5,000 people living here . It feels more like a ghost town , in an eery yet exciting way . Unlike the large Chilean city of Puntarenas across the Straight of Magellan , or Ushuaia , the southernmost city on the Argentine side of Tierra del Fuego , Porvenir is isolated , there are no cruisers squawking around the city on their South American cruise around Cape Horn or adventure seekers ready to jet off to Antarctica . Visitors here are bird watchers or those Transamerica cyclists who detour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly feels like the end of the world . <p> Scattered among blocks of rundown houses are a few tourist cabins and one sterile hotel outside of town , but there is only one place you want to stay in Porvenir : Hosteria Yendegaia . <h> A beacon on a hill- <p> Perched high on a hill in the center of town , this just slightly oversized yellow house can be spotted from just about anywhere . While it does n't  exactly stand out , it is clear from its refurbished look and fresh coat of paint that Yendegaia is something special . We could not have been more relieved when , once inside , this Bed and Breakfast was so well-run and cozy that it felt more like we were in an English B&amp;B than here at the end of the world . <p> The bedrooms are all en-suite , with clean , bright bathrooms and showers with scalding hot water a detail of utmost important here . Our visit was in mid-March , which is only early autumn in the southern hemisphere , but between whipping winds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us summer-chasers . <p> Luckily , along with warm showers , carpeted floors , strong heaters , fluffy towels and thick , pillow-y blankets for refuge , Vicentes priority when refurbishing the house two years ago was putting in double pane windows to keep out the weather , whose presence here is always palpable . <p> Upstairs there are ten bedrooms just like ours , each with a TV and a set of oversized twin beds . The absence of queen beds irked me at first , until I realized that , with guests almost exclusively groups of birdwatchers , the beds are in fact quite practical . This is n't really a couples retreat spot yet . Porvenir , which means future in Spanish , has quite a future , indeed , Vicente assured us . <p> Time moves slower here and we have plenty of time to chat during our two-night stay , so it is easy to see why he is so enthusiastic , no matter how bleak things looked to us outsiders on the surface . <h> The future is bright- <p> During our stay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , birdwatchers , of course , but we imagined how quickly things would change if there were just one smart entrepreneur who opened a tourist information office and created tours our into the true Patagonian wilderness. - With absolutely no public transportation in this area of Tierra del Fuego there is no way for tourists like us to see much outside of the town ( which boasts exactly zero tourist sites ) . There is plenty to be experienced , it just needs to be packaged better : in addition to the birds , there are penguin colonies , and there could be plenty of guided hikes and adventure sports set with a backdrop of that incredible , otherworldly Patagonian landscape . With not much to do , had there been a city ' tour , we would have taken that , too , in order to learn more about life in this isolated but interesting place.Attracting tourists should become less of a challenge with the great-value accommodation of Hosteria Yendegaia already in place , which also boasts the best kitchen in town . Vicentes brother-in-law is the live-in cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretches without guests . Our first dinner was a delicious soup and bread , while the French group devoured a sophisticated three-course menu of various succulent meats . After chatting about Chilean food with Vicente that next afternoon , they threw together a special vegetarian version of Chorillana , an **31;271;TOOLONG dish set on a bed of french fries that is typically piled high with meat . It was an interesting result , but we just so pleased with their playful experimentation , all on our account . <p> Breakfast was the only aspect that was not as good as a British bed and breakfast , but miles beyond the usual hotel breakfast in Chile because , in addition to white rolls , butter and jam , we were also served two eggs any style . Tea , coffee or hot chocolate are available all day at no charge , and it was so comforting to fill our bellies with warm green tea throughout the rainy afternoons . <h> Stand Out Feature : A True Refuge <p> You go to end of the world , to a place like Porvenir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chile or tourist-saturated Ushuaia in Argentina . And you certainly get it . For hundreds of miles around Porvenir there is nothing but wilderness , an almost unsettling barrenness . In the town itself , there are no places where people gather together , no cafes , and very few , very empty restaurants . For us , this solitude could easily become one of loneliness without knowing we could return to the comfort of Yendegaia , after a day fighting 30-40 mph winds , cold and rain on walks around town each day . <p> Coming back in to this safe haven made us feel the right balance of comfort and adventure . In fact , when we said our goodbyes and began our hitchhiking adventure across Patagonia ( well cover that in a post soon ) - we both found ourselves dreaming of Yendegaias comforts and hoping that , should we successfully arrive in Ushuaia that night , our hotel would provide the same comforts ( it would n't , no where near it , in fact ) . <h> Room for Improvement : Living Room- <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as it gets anywhere . Butthe only thing we can come up with to improve upon is the downstairs area . Next to the dining room there are several chairs around two coffee tables , but these are covered in books that Vicente and his photographer father co-authored and published , and native artwork his mother creates . These products are gorgeous , top quality and worth purchasing , but it feels more like a store than a living room , so all relaxing has to take place in the bedrooms upstairs . <h> Overall <p> At the time of writing , Hosteria Yendegaia is the absolute only choice to stay at in Provenir . A beacon of warmth and friendliness , this is exactly the type of accommodation we would recommend anywhere in the world ; be it in the British countryside , a world-class city or here at the end of the word. - If you are nearing the end of your trans-americas cycling trip , planning a bird-watching adventure or just curious about Tierra del Fuego , you should definitely stay here ! 129336 @qwx989336 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns and cities all seem to be vying for the award for southernmost and so all are aware of each other . Porvenir is just north in terms of longitude of Puerto Williams , which is a small village but further south than Ushuaia , a pretty big little city in Argentina which claims southernmost CITY in the world . = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143070 @2543070/ <p> The two of us Girls love almost nothing more than a road trip and our recent New Mexico road trip was a major highlight of 2013 . Every day brought incredible landscapes , dusty Spanish outposts and fire-hot chiles . Every night , however , the hotel quality was left to the luck of the draw especially in the southern part of the state . Motel life was fine for a while , but- after ten days on the road we arrived to Santa Fe via the Turquoise Trail from Albuquerque and pulled in to a Bed and Breakfast so perfect , at first it felt like a dream . <p> El Farolito Bed and Breakfast is set in a typical Santa Fe-style compound which involves several one-story adobe buildings around a central open space . The compound was built and owned by an extended Spanish family who had settled here in the 19th century . Just a ten minute walk to the center of Santa Fe , the compound was eventually sold off as individual units before owners Wayne and Walt purchased it several years ago and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today. - El Farolito offers the exact experience you hope for at a Bed &amp; Breakfast : personal attention , personal recommendations and a home-away-from-home feeling . <p> Dani and I were easily twenty years younger than the average guest , but it is hard to know whether this would always be the case who else vacations mid-week at the end of September other than retirees and digital nomads like us . In these situations with older couples , we sometimes feel awkward when our relationship is understood as friendship until we have to make our status as a lesbian couple clear . At El Farolito we felt even more at home as Wayne and Walt are a gay couple who has been together for years and years . <p> The Rooms <p> After packing up and moving hotels almost every day on the trip , it was so great to settle in to these gorgeous rooms for three nights . Each of the eight casitas is individually decorated , all with features like rough cut exposed ceiling beams , Spanish tiles and adobe fireplaces built into each room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had bedroom with en-suite bathroom and a separate living room . The following two nights we stayed in the Madre Acequia room , which , although it did n't have two rooms , was open and spacious and felt like somewhere we could have settled and moved into for a week or two . <p> All rooms have a fully equipped wet bar , with coffee maker and coffee , bottle openers , bottles of water , a sink and small refrigerator , so it was that much easier to feel at home. - On the big wooden dressers there were candy bowls filled with chocolate , and each room has an outdoor patio , some more private than others , but all of them are perfect for relaxing in the fresh air . What we loved about the rooms inside is that instead of a desk and stiff backed chair , our rooms had big comfy sofa chairs to relax . <p> Bathrooms are modestly-sized but beautifully decorated with Spanish tiles and I love the designated black towels for make-up removal . I always feel terrible getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first night we arrived we both immediately changed and threw on the big comfortable robes which were so puffy they were almost like pillows . <p> Our time in Santa Fe was limited so we were out and about relatively late at night ( they seem to roll the sidewalks up around 9pm in this town ) , but both nights our rooms had private outside entrances , so we could come and go as we pleased without interrupting any of the other guests . Because the property is so spacious it would have been easy to assume the Wi-Fi would n't work at the casitas further from the main house , but we had lightning fast internet in our casita , the suite and in the common area . <p> The common area and breakfast <p> The owners and innkeeper were so friendly , we could have sat in the common area and talked for hours on end , but they are also entirely respectful of privacy and you have as much discretion here as you 'd like . But either way , you would come out for breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant you would head to in town . There is a hot and cold buffet each morning with one delicious hot dish and a side , plus cereals , granola , greek yogurt , coffee , tea , water , a plate of fresh fruit and two plates of freshly baked pastries/banana breads . Our vegetarian diet was catered to without question , and on the first morning we passed on the breakfast pizza that had meat and enjoyed our own delicious fritata ! Every afternoon the scent of freshly baked cakes and cookies and piping hot coffee waft into your room and tease you out to eat a piece or two , entranced and possibly against your own will . <p> The owners collect art , and the whole compound is beautifully decorated . Some guests return year after year , choosing their casita based on the artwork that hangs on the walls and the pieces in the common room reflect the intense desert landscapes of northern New Mexico . <p> There are bookshelves spilling over with guidebooks , maps and reading related to Santa Fe . We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherry on hand to answer any questions and make on point suggestions according to our own travel style and tastes . We may have skipped out on a visit to Canyon Road , an entire winding road filled with art galleries and big bold sculptures , but thanks to Walt 's suggestion , this turned out to be one the highlights of our far too short time in town . <p> The location <p> Yet another positive about El Farolito is its location . You can walk almost anywhere ten minutes to Canyon Road and ten to get to the famous plaza . In the other direction ten minutes , too , is the up-and-coming Railroad/Guadalupe district , where we walked have coffee and hit the farmer 's market . With the proximity to almost everything of importance and the city 's free shuttle bus we definitely did n't use our car while in town , and the B&amp;B has plenty of parking for all guests , as well . <p> Overall <p> Wayne and Walt have infused their experience of running not one but two local bed and breakfasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kachinas ) and their passion for Santa Fe and the Southwest in general into creating a home away from home that predicts your needs before you are aware of them yourself . 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Looks lovely ! I can definitely see why you 'd want to stay a week or more . And it mustve been nice to walk into a place where your relationship is immediately understood as what it is , without question , hesitation or uncertainty . In fact , it just occurred to me , that 's what it must feel like to travel as a straight couple . Huh . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Instead , the three block radius might represent the Italian influence of the past , but nothing feels truly authentic here . I also remember being struck by the fact that Chinatown seemed to have completely taken over , and we never expected neon Cantonese signs anywhere near Italian restaurants .

Come hungry because Alana , tour guide and owner of the company , will make sure you leave completely stuffed , all while feeding you fascinating nuggets of history about the waves of immigration that have given New York , and the U.S. as a whole , the texture it has today . <p> Along the way , Alana cleared up several myths and misunderstandings for us , and we chose our top three to share here : <p> Myth #1 : - New York 's best Italian food can be found in Little Italy <p> Truth:Alana did n't  really recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took us to two of the area 's longest-running shops to sample homemade Mozzarella , imported cheeses and prosciutto , a bakery to sample cannolis and we managed to fit in an excellent slice of pizza before heading to Chinatown . Dani returned to Di Palo 's a few weeks later with the discount coupon you get on the tour , and bough freshly made raviolis , sauce and more of the mouthwatering Piave cheese , which we ate at our temporary New York home . <p> Despite all the yellowing Zagat rating signs on the doors of the restaurants in Little Italy , Alana emphasizes they are all for tourists , and any local will tell you that no one comes to Little Italy for world-class Italian . She did tell us stories of gangsters and celebrities and shoot-outs and all that mobster jazz you would expect to hear about here . <p> Myth #2 : - Chinatown pushed the Italians out of Little Italy <p> Truth : The Italians had long since left by the time Chinese-American set up shop in the area .

After the first and second waves of Italian immigrants landed on US shores , they quickly moved out of the crowded tenement-style living to the then-open spaces of upstate New York and New Jersey , to return to the farm life most of them knew from the old country . <p> It was n't until after the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed in 1943 that the Chinese began returning and shifting from typically West Coast immigration to settle New Yorks Chinatown neighborhood . On the tour , our senses were overloaded with Chinese life , from the cheap exotic fruits like jackfruits and mangosteens sold in street stalls at South East Asian prices to the overall feeling at Columbus Park . When the Italians lived here , this park was the site of incredible violence ( think Gangs of New York ) but today this is an outdoor living room where multiple generations of Chinese-Americans do Tai Chi , play traditional string instruments and sit and chat in Cantonese . <p> Myth #3 : Tours are for tourists. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) from this food tasting and cultural walking tour . We have had serious bad luck with tours lately , having been on several which were boring , manufactured tourism products served up like processed food on store shelves .

It was personal , honest and Alana took the time to answer everyone 's questions , not just about the area but things like directions , other New York tours , public transportation and more . <p> The tour was the canvas upon which Alana painted an incredible picture of New York City for us . <p> A personal highlight was the fact that , even though there is plenty of meat on the tour , Alana was able to effortlessly adjust the tour for the two of us without affecting the experience for anyone else .

We would have preferred a similar stop at a dim sum restaurant , especially after learning that Chinese dim sum is traditionally served between 10 and 2 , which would have been perfect timing . <p> This was but a slight blip in an otherwise perfect tour , however , which left us seriously stuffed to the gills. - Here is an overview of the stops on our food tasting tour : <p> A sticky , humid morning had given way to an extremely hot afternoon , but even as the tour wound down , Alana stayed to point us all in the right direction and answer questions from everyone in the group before we splintered off back into the wilds of Manhattan for the day . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks ago !

@@107143075 @2543075/ <h> The Most Epic Iceland Road Trip , Part I <p> The best way to see Iceland ? Without a doubt , on a road trip ! And since I love road trips , I did n't have to think about it for too long when it came to deciding how we 'd spend our week in Iceland : we were going to drive the Ring Road . <p> The Ring Road , or Highway 1 , is an 828 miles ( 1332 kilometers ) long road- around the country , basically circling the island . It passes everything that Iceland is famous for : stunning waterfalls , volcanoes , glaciers and glacier lagoons , geysers , lava fields and geothermal fields , and the countrys incredibly diverse scenery . <p> Since we only had six days ( plus one day in Reykjavik , which I did n't  want to skip entirely ) we opted for a self-guided driving tour , which was an excellent decision.While I was researching Iceland road trip routes I came across Icelandic Farm Holidays , a local tour operator who offers both self-drive and guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , depending on how much time you have and what you 're most interested in , and the tour that caught my eye was the Highlights of Iceland ' tour . It would bring us around the island in six days , leaving the seventh day to explore Reykjavik . Perfect ! Six days for the Ring Road is pretty ambitious- and meant we would be spending a lot of time in the car " but if you do n't mind driving and are equipped with some good podcasts and/or entertaining travel companions , it 's not too crazy . In hindsight I have to say that I 've driven longer distances on previous road trips , but if you want some time to hike or do some activities along the way , I 'd recommend allowing ten days to drive the Ring Road.The advantage of a self-guided driving tour ? I did n't need to deal with any of the planning . Usually I am the one who maps out daily routes , determines where to break up the trip and where to spend the night , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the trip that I was glad for not having to spend too much time researching and organizing the trip . Instead , I headed from my gate straight to the Europcar rental car counter at the airport , where I was handed a detailed Iceland Road Guide ( over 600 pages ! ) and a Welcome Pack which included a comprehensive day-by-day breakdown of the trip and vouchers for each of the hotels we would stay at along the way . Plus the most important item : a GPS system.We left the Loft Hostel in Reykjavik on a rainy September morning to start our drive but not the Ring Road quite yet . Instead , we started with a detour : the Golden Circle . This one-day drive , easily reachable from Reykjavik , is the most popular day trip for Iceland visitors , especially those who do n't have time to drive the entire Ring Road . <p> The trip covers just under 190 miles ( around 300km ) , normally looping back to Reykjavik , but since we would follow the Ring Road counter-clockwise , we took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd spend the night instead of returning to the capital . <h> Highlights of Day I : +Pingvellir , Gullfoss and Geysir <p> +Pingvellir National Park is where the American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet , and one thing that I really wanted to do was snorkel over the rift between the two plates , which is something that I 've been obsessing about ever since reading that you could do it . Sadly our itinerary did n't  leave enough time for it but it means I 'll have to return to Iceland one day , which is totally fine with me ! And even though I missed out on this unique ( and icy ! ) Silfra snorkeling experience , our first day was already packed with stunning landscapes- and it was an indication of what our week would be like : a succession of waterfalls , geothermal fields , more waterfalls , fascinating scenery and lots of sudden Pull over NOW ! photo ops.During the Golden Circle drive , we already saw two geysers : Geysir and Strokkur . Geysir used to be the biggest geyser in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Luckily , Strokkur did n't  decide to stop and amazes the onlooking crowds with columns of water up to 98 feet ( 30 meters ) . The spectacle happens every six minutes , and its a breathtaking sight.We passed several horse farms with dozens of Icelandic horses , and sometimes they were standing right near the fence , as if they were waiting for us to come pet them . And how could we not pull over to say hi to these cuties ? This was something that made me truly appreciate driving the Golden Circle myself instead of being trapped on a tour bus : that we were able to stop whenever and wherever we wanted , and spend as much time as we wanted at each stop . <p> Another highlight of +Pingvellir was Gullfoss , which is one of Icelands most popular waterfalls . Here , the- Hv+t+ River plunges into a 105 feet ( 32 meters ) deep crevice and creates the- uniquely triangular shaped two-tiered falls . The roaring sound of the water gets louder and louder the closer you get , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you are standing right next to them ( plus , you were getting soaked , see picture below ! ) . The next waterfall had a lot to live up to.But , this being Iceland , it did meet our expectations ! Our next stop was Seljalandsfoss , which rises 200 feet in the air and you can even- walk behind the falls . I do n't  think you 're able to walk behind any other waterfalls in Iceland . I was in complete awe when I was- standing behind the falls and the thick- curtain of water was thundering down from a cliff right in front of me.From Seljalandsfoss , we had one more waterfall on our itinerary for the day : Skogafoss . While this one is about the same height as Seljalandsfoss , it is about twice as wide and it seems more powerful . Even though we started to get tired as our first action-packed day came to an end , I am glad that we headed up the wooden stairs to see the waterfall from the top , because the views over the lush green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two waterfalls , Seljalandsfoss and Skogafoss , are not part of the Golden Circle , by the way . We passed them because we headed south towards Vik after visiting Gulfoss instead of circling back to Iceland . Even if you only have a short stopover in Iceland and cant drive the entire Ring Road , I recommend this drive , no matter if you do it on an organized tour or drive it yourself . That way you can also add on Seljalandsfoss and Skogafoss like we did.I suggest you- allow- at least- six- hours for the Golden Circle " you can drive it in less than four hours but you 'll want to stop and take photos every ten minutes or so ( really , there 's a gorgeous view around every other corner ! ) . Its doable to also visit Seljalandsfoss and Skogafoss and then circle back to Reykjavik , but allow a full day for this trip.We ended the day with our first farmhouse stay , which was a lovely farm- just off the Ring road , about 15 miles outside of Vik , surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to end our first day of road-tripping and to recharge our batteries before heading further east . 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

I 've already mentioned it briefly in my monthly round-up last week , but I wanted to share some more details about the trip , and last but not least : I 'd love your input , if you 've been to Tel Aviv ! <h> What makes Tel Aviv such an awesome destination ? <p> You might remember that when I visited Tel Aviv for the first time last year , I completely ( and unexpectedly ! ) fell for the city . I loved the vibrant coffee shop scene , the nightlife , the beaches right in the city , the old port town of Jaffa on the southern end of the city , and how people were enjoying life there . I spent my days strolling through El Carmel market , running along the promenade , watching the sunset with hundreds of people on the beach every night before checking out some of the many fancy bars . I searched ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I ate my way around town , or through all of Israel to be precise , because Tel Aviv has some of the best food I 've had anywhere in the world I am still talking about the delicious dishes I had there all the time , and just the thought of all the good food I 'll eat when I get back to Tel Aviv makes my mouth water . I dove into the gay scene , and one of the things I loved most about Tel Aviv was how gay-friendly and tolerant the city is , especially considering this is the Middle East . Not a single country or city in the region is accepting or tolerating gay culture , but in Tel Aviv , it is celebrated openly and the city was recently voted best gay city in the world , ahead of New York even ! <p> By the time I had to leave the city , I was ready to move to Tel Aviv . There was only one downside to this amazing city : it was expensive . <h> Why is Tel Aviv so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during my visit was how pricey everything in Tel Aviv was . I had just come from New York , where prices for most things are through the roof , but I had n't expected Tel Aviv to be on par with prices in New York . A small bottle of beer in a bar or restaurant for example was usually 30 or 32 Shekels " that 's 7.75 " 8.25 US Dollars ! That 's even more expensive than New York , and this article revealed that Tel Aviv is in fact the third expensive city for beer in the world , only Hong Kong and Geneva charge more for beer.Prices for food span a wider range " similar to New York , I was able to find falafel sandwiches at little street stalls for about US$3 , but I also paid ILS55 ( US$14.19 ) for a simple Israeli breakfast and a coffee in a coffee shop in Tel Aviv . Which might be okay for someone coming from New York , but for someone from Berlin , a city filled with cheap breakfast places , this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who started out as a small hole-in-the-wall shakshuka place , now charges upwards of ILS40 ( US$10.30 ) for this simple egg dish . But its not only food and going out : living costs in Tel Aviv have increased dramatically over the past few years . The city jumped from #32 to #18 in the ranking of the worlds most expensive cities last year , indicating just how much pricier everyday life has become . So it 's not a surprise that young Israelis flock to Berlin in droves to take advantage of the 79 Cent beers in the supermarkets and cheap rents , but is it possible for someone from Berlin to visit Tel Aviv on a small budget " and still have a good time ? <h> The challenge : Tel Aviv on $77 per day <p> So when I was challenged to find out if it was possible to visit Tel Aviv on a shoestring , I did n't have to think twice : I 'll be returning to Tel Aviv with a tight budget this week and will find out what a daily budget of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor in Tel Aviv these days . Of course it is possible to visit Tel Aviv with even less money than that if you only eat at home and couchsurf , but I want to know if I can visit Tel Aviv on a small budget without limiting myself to doing only free stuff . I still want a comfortable place to stay ( which is already included in the daily budget ) , be able to go out and have a good time , eat out instead of cooking for myself . <h> I need your help ! <p> Right now , I am researching cheap places to eat , drink and other free things to do , and could use your input .

I eat a lot of street food when I am there just because its so good . I also travel everywhere on foot , by bus , or bike rental . <p> These are some of my favorite places for food : <p> -Aboulafia , of course . I love the pockets stuffed with cheese and olives . -Oveds for their famous eggplant sandwich . I have heard the one in Givatayim is better than the one in Tel Aviv , but TA is much more convenient . -Moroccan soup places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a vegetarian option , but you should check . The address is Yehya Kapah St 22 , or thereabouts . It is just two small restaurants and all they sell is soup . -Bakeries at the end of the the shuk near the old bus station ( Daniel Street ) . -Chain cafes . I would never eat at a Starbucks , but cafes in Israel are different . The chains , like Cafe Cafe , actually have good , fresh food . -Suzana on Shabazi St. -Dr . Shakshuka -Try bourekas . There are lots of stands throughout the city . They are vegetarian dough pockets . -If you are making yourself breakfasts , buy spreadable cheese its amazing . And eat a lot of yogurt . <p> I have spent a lot of time just walking around Tel Aviv and exploring . Here are some free/cheap things to do : <p> -Visit these neighborhoods : Old Jaffa ( Yafo ) , Neve Tzedek , area around Rabin Square , Sheinkin Street , Rothschild Street ( just walk up and down ; you might find queer stuff here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhoods. -Visit Shuk HaCarmel , which you already know , but I visit every time I am there and always discover something new .

We often get a drink at Honey Beach and watch the sunset . -The new trend in Israel is to remake cool , old spaces into malls . They are worth visiting , even though they fill them with fancy boutiques and expensive restaurants . Visit : HaTachana ( the train station ) , which is at the end of Shabazi ; Sarona , built by the German Templars ( I havent been , but really want to take a tour ) ; the Old Port . -Bauhaus Center tours .

@@107143079 @2543079/ <h> Six things nobody tells you about Colombias Totumo Mud Volcano <p> If you find yourself in Cartagena , chances are that you 'll come across posters advertising the Totumo Mud Volcano . Its sort of a rite of passage in Cartagena if you come here , you 'll visit the volcano . So obviously , I signed up for a tour , not sure if it would be fun to take a mud bath with a bunch of strangers or not .. But what could I do ? The Cartagena rite of passage , you know ? And so I found myself in a mini van with 16 strangers on a sunny Sunday afternoon , ready to join the thousands before me , getting a mud bath in a volcano . Once you get there though , you quickly realize that this is n't really a volcano filled with mud , its more like an upside down cone filled with mud . There were other things that nobody told me before I headed to Totumo , things I would have been glad to know before I go , which is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here : <h> 1 . You 'll get up close and personal with strangers <p> The mud volcano is actually closer to a puddle of mud than anything else , but picture a really really deep one , maybe even bottomless . If you take a tour to Totumo , like most people do , because its the cheapest and easiest way from Cartagena , you and 16 fellow mud enthusiasts will change into their swimsuits and head up the volcano . One by one , you 'll descend into the mud , slowly going down a ladder from the top , because the mud is much lower than shown in the pretty advertising posters around town . The mud used to reach up to the top of the volcano , and I 'm not sure where it all went but you have to descend a good 20-16 feet ( 6-8 meters ) now to get into the creamy , smelly mud . Considering that there are several guys selling bottles of this good ol mud at the bottom of the volcano , they might have sold all the mud that used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once you 're in the mud , be prepared to be groped by some Colombian dudes who are spending all day waiting inside this mud hole , eager to massage white people for a small fee ( COP4,000 ) . <p> One by one , the rest of your group will join you , or maybe you are one of the lucky ones last in line , looking down sceptically on everyone floating in the mud , wondering if you really want to get in there . But as the mud hole fills up , you 'll quickly befriend everybody else because you all realize what a ridiculous situation you are in , and the fuller it gets , the closer you 'll get to everyone . I felt quite a few hairy legs , boobs , feet and other body parts while I was floating around , thinking to myself how weird it was that I was n't sinking . <p> Pro Tip : Do n't  be one of the fools who dip their entire head into the mud there 's nothing to clean the mud off your eyes , and your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make it out alive <p> Once you decide that you 've had enough , you will try to make your way out of the mud , which now that the mud hole is quite deep means relying on a rickety old wooden ladder , which is extremely slippery , thanks to all the mud monsters whove made their way out of there before you . So hold onto the rails for your dear life literally ! The story of how you conquered a mud volcano is a good one , but you have to make it out alive to live to tell it . <h> 3 . Prepare to be studied and stared at <p> One thing that was interesting was that during my visit , several tour buses pulled up . At first I thought : wow , itll take forever for them all to take a mud bath , because the hole does n't  fit a 48 people bus load , and a minivan load of 17 already takes a while to get in . But then I realized that they do n't  come to take a mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim , stare at the gringos ( including you ! ) , snap your picture , and then walk down again after pointing at you and chatting about you with their fellow observers . They 're probably thinking : Why the hell do these gringos pay so much money to get into this stinky puddle , ruin their swimsuits in mud and get their hair all muddy ? It feels particularly humiliating when you 're the one who is in the process of emerging from the mud , looking like a mud monster , and have a guy grope you to get some of the mud off you with his hands before you make your way down to the cleaning area Yes , cleaning area . <h> 4 . Lots of groping ! <p> Even though there is a huge lake next to the volcano , you cant just jump in and wash the mud off it is too shallow , and so the business-savvy Colombians who live around here set up a few giant jars near the lake which some guys keep filling with bucket loads of green water that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , a lady will grab you and start washing the mud off you with the help of a little bowl , in which she puts the green lake water from the big jar . These ladies are also not afraid to touch your private parts , and I 'm sure the lady who washed me enjoyed my boobs , that 's how intensely she was rubbing them . They 're also not afraid to just take your swimsuit off if they feel there 's a lot of mud in there my friend found herself without her bikini top within a couple of minutes of getting to the cleaning area , while another lady tried to get into her pants pull down her pants . That 's the moment when you get really close with all of your new mud friends you 'll see much more of them than you expected . <h> 5 . Youll hand out tips right and left <p> Once you 're released , you go back to your belongings which are stored in a little storage room while you frolic in the mud , and suddenly , everyone who has helped you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guy who held your camera ? $1 . The lady who washed you ? $1 . The kid who watched your shoes ? $1 . The guy who massaged you ? $1 ( amazingly cheap massage , btw ! ) . It was incredible how everyone who did something for you finds you again afterwards and makes sure he or she gets paid . In all the tipping mania I even tipped a kid who did n't  do anything other than holding his hand open ! But he did n't  do anything for us , my friend pointed out . Oh .. Well he just made 50 cents by simply holding his hand open. <h> 6 . Mmmmh that smell <p> When you 're finally back in the van , you 'll be able to enjoy the sulfur smell for another hour ( at least , depending on traffic in Cartagena ) because you think they cleaned you , but as a matter of fact you 'll still find mud in the most random body parts for days ( if you 're one of the lucky ones whose accommodation in Cartagena has hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> In total , you 'll spend more time in the van than in the mud , by the way . Our van showed up half an hour late and then picked up other mud-hungry tourists around town for another hour ( ! ) before we were finally on the way . The ride takes about an hour once you leave the city and an hour back . You 'll spend about an hour at the volcano , including cleaning , changing and a quick beer to get rid of the taste of mud in your mouth . There are two tours to the volcano every day ; one leaves in the morning , and one leaves in the afternoon . <h> Cost : <p> Tour to the volcano : COP45,000 ( US$13.82 ) <p> Tip for guy who takes your pictures : COP4,000 ( US$1.28 ) <p> Tip for woman who washes you : COP4,000 ( US$1.28 ) <p> Tip for the guy who massages you : COP4,000 ( US$1.28 ) <p> Tip for the kid who cleans your shoes : COP1,000-2,000 ( US$0.37-0.64 ) <p> Beer ( optional ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : priceless . <p> *Exchange rate 2016 <h> Other practical information <p> Is there another way to get to the volcano ? <p> Yes , you can take a cab to the volcano if you do n't  like crowds . If you time it right ( early afternoon would be best , I think , before the arrival of the afternoon group ) , you 'll most likely have the volcano all to yourself . Its worth it if you are a group of four people ; expect to pay at least COP200,000 for the cab , including return to Cartagena and the driver waiting for you while you splash around in the mud . <p> Are there different tour companies offering this tour ? <p> At the moment , there 's only one tour company who runs this tour : Ruta ecologica . You can book the trip from most hotels and hostels and your offices around town . Pickup is usually where you book it . The price ( COP45,000/ around US$14 ) includes transportation and a snack of fresh watermelon after the mud bath . The company has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  expect more than a trickle ) right next to the volcano , complete with lockers where you can lock up your valuables . <p> Can you trust a random guide with your camera / phone ? <p> This was my biggest concern , but their system works .

He s going to snap 10 15 pictures of you . I took a few extra ones on my camera before we left . You have no chance but handing over your camera , by the way , if you want to eternalize the picture of your mud-covered self . <h> What to bring / what not to bring <p> Old bikini Bring an old bikini unless you have the chance to wash it the same day . The mud turned out to be pretty persistent and I 'm glad I was n't wearing my best swimsuit . <p> Water &amp; Sunscreen The volcano itself does n't  offer any shade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrated . There are some kiosks and small roadside restaurants around the volcano where you can buy snacks and soft drinks or beers after the experience . <p> Money Bring enough cash ( and small change ) to cover all your tips , but I would n't bring too much cash or any valuables that you do n't  need ( credit cards , jewelry , etc ) . <h> PIN IT ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> If you 're there with the right people you 'll have a great time , Danielle !

I have been at the exact same volcano about six years ago , when the mud still was at the top . I am shocked to see that the level of mud went down so bad .

Its bigger and with fewer people , although its a bit of a trek from Cartagena , and you cant expect the same visitor infrastructure ( e.g. camera person , tour company ) , although there were washer women there . Its a few years since I was there , so hopefully its still around ! <p> We went a couple a years ago . Very weird sensation to be suspended in the mud and not sinking ! People definitely need to be warned about the groping !

We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably made our time getting massaged and laying in the mud shorter than it might have been . But the time we had was sufficient and really fun . And the mud was very close to the top only about two ladder rungs showed above the mud . I suspect they add water from time to time to replenish . Or maybe it burps up from time to time no idea . <p> I would not consider any of the contact " groping " however just rough handling of body parts for the massage and then the cleanup . I really do n't  think these folks are looking to get cheap thrills its a job for survival in a mostly-poor country . We did n't  have any spectators when we were there ( we took the afternoon tour ) . Definitely dunked under and had no regrets a little ( supposedly therapeutic ) mud never killed anyone .

The water was quite warm ( the hole it was pulled from must be a hot spring and was salt water ) . Keep in mind that this whole thing is a third-world style production do n't  do it if you want to be pampered . And leave your passport and wallet behind you wo n't need them and will have less to worry about although I think the whole thing is built on trust that tourists wont get scammed . Imagine what would happen to their livelihoods if word got out that people were being robbed . <p> A word about timeliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cartagena to continue a type-A existence ?

Read your article after I booked it and thought I would n't like it , but I 'd say it was worth it despite only being 5-10 minutes inside . <p> There were about 50 people in line . I saw 20-50 people in line the whole time we were there . I had to bask in the sun about 30 minutes before it was my turn . I saw buses from other tour companies . I saw at least six buses . The volcano was pretty full of mud . <p> Upside : strange experience , cheap Downside : touristy , not enough time , long drive from Cartagena 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

My next trip to this gorgeous country is already in the works , and I cant wait to visit all the places I did n't  make it to the first time around.Whenever people ask me about my favorite places in South East Asia , I cant stop gushing over the picture-perfect beaches I visited , the lush green islands with their scenic rice fields and softly swaying palm trees , a stark contrast to the urban sprawl of Manila which is rapidly turning into a modern , advanced city ; rivaling Singapore and Bangkok with the number of skyscrapers and shopping malls that continue to emerge in the ever growing capital . When I sat in one of Manilas third-wave coffee shops , located in one of the shiny fancy malls , after returning from Palawan , I could n't believe that a day earlier , I had shared the road with ox carts and that I did n't  even have cell phone reception in El Nido @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their smartphones again.The many faces of the Philippines were fascinating , the marine life breathtaking , the people welcoming and kind .

What month where you in Boracay ? I heard from another blogger that there was a big green algae problem when she was there due to pollution and the water was n't safe to swim in ( although people still were ) this has kind of put me off from visiting when there are so many other amazing islands ( with a lot less people ) that I could visit instead <p> Katie From what I 've heard the algae usually come in March and stay for a couple of months . Those happen to be busy months in Boracay ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait anyway = After the typhoon season ( November / December ) is supposed to be the best time ( not crazy busy yet ) . <p> Makes me want to go back there so much ! Unfortunately , I found the cities in the Philippines to be pretty ugly and dirty , but then I did n't  visit Manila , so maybe that 's different . That said , its worth going just for the beaches , right ? ! <p> Hi Dani , I read your story about you and Jess and I had to say I was sad . But when I then browsed through some of your articles , I saw you are certainly lucky girl and I am now back lucky as well . = I wish you all the best ! BTW I like all these pictures ! They are really amazing ! <p> Very ambitious indeed , Nina ! = I would probably skip a couple of stops and enjoy others more . Traveling in the Philippines is hard and frustrating at times . Almost every single one of my flights was delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example . Going up to Banaue and Batad for two days only seems rushed to me I suggest reading Alex posts about her trip up there to decide if you want to add on another day . Batanes is supposed to be beautiful but also very far out of the way .. I 'd consider traveling to Malapascua ( from Cebu ) instead , to save you some time , and its just as beautiful . Just some food for thought = <p> Just came across your blog and your Philippines posting ! I love it ! ! I am a single mom and have a 7 year old boy . We went jet-setting off to the Philippines a few months ago and loved it . We arrived in Manila and submersed ourselves into culture and took the overnight ferry from Batangas to the little island outside of Boracay and then took little boats out to Boracay for some beach time . My son especially loved the Volcano in Tagatay ! We took a whole day to road trip up there from Manila . We had crepes at a darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a boat that took us across this volcanic lake . Once across there is horses you can rent to ride up to the top of the volcano . Such a neat experience and amazing views . Can not wait to go back . Two weeks is NOT long enough to see all of the amazingness . Happy Travels to you and thank you for sharing ! ! <p> Hi Caty , thank you so much for your comment ! I love that you went to the Philippines with your son amazing ! ! I cant wait to go back there either = I hope I 'll get to return this coming winter = <p> Wow ! Your photos made me want to travel more in the Philippines . I am from the Philippines , but I prefer traveling elsewhere . I think I traveled to more foreign cities than in the Philippines . I need to go to Siquijor ! ! !

@@107143082 @2543082/ <h> Traveling in India : A Truly Life Changing Experience <p> India will change you forever , I would hear over and over again as soon as we announced we would travel to the subcontinent . Really ? ' , I thought incredulously , what could possibly have such an impact on me there ? I had traveled through Central America and South East Asia , and had encountered extreme poverty , dysfunctional cities , violence and fear . I did n't think that anything could still shock me after the things I had already seen , from the child beggars in Guatemala to the limping stray dogs in Nicaragua and the in-your-face sex tourism in Cambodia . <p> But nothing prepares you for India . Nothing prepares you for the intense smells , the chaos that ensues when a herd of cows decides to take a stroll along a busy highway , the crazy traffic and the constant honking , the homeless people sleeping on sidewalks , not dozens , but hundreds of them , or the dead bodies you 'll see . You ca n't block out the begging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with those heartbreakingly sad eyes while they shyly beg you for money with their palms pleadingly open , and by the village kids that run around dirt roads in just underwear and without shoes because they do n't  have anything . <p> Village life in India <p> India is a lot to take in . And India is hard to take . Even though you might read this now thinking I feel like I know what to expect when I go there , when you get there , it will knock you off your feet . <p> I might have painted a pretty bleak picture of India so far , so let me correct this . I did not hate India " quite on the contrary : I loved traveling there . While many scenes you 'll experience in on a daily basis the countless stray animals , the beggars , the crazy train rides , the deformations on peoples bodies are hard to digest , especially in such a huge concentration , there are equally as many things that will amaze you . The incredibly diverse scenery for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tropical beaches in Goa and the barren moon-like scenery around Hampi . The ornate , grand and mystifying temples , the scrumptious food that bursts with flavors , the wonderfully welcoming people were all things that made me fall in love with India . <p> Beautiful India <p> Some travelers find it annoying to be stared at or even have their hair touched , but I have to say though that I was just as enticed by the large families I met . Especially the women , all dressed up in colorful saris , painted with henna tattoos , wearing golden little jewels or bindis on their foreheads , and eye-catching golden jewelry hanging from their wrists , necks and sometimes noses , fascinated me just as much as I fascinated them , the light skinned girl with the bright blonde hair . While they wanted to feel my yellow hair , I wanted to run my fingers through their thick black hair . The timid smiles and curious looks , and how we tried to communicate despite their limited English to find out more about each others lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most rewarding experiences in India : getting to know the locals <p> The way India changes you is how it changes your perspective on the smallest details in your own life . For one , I just can not complain about anything in my life anymore no matter how hard something might seem in a specific moment , I am blessed with a great life , a passport that let 's me travel anywhere in the world without any bureaucratic hassle the fact alone that I am able to travel ! Seeing the families in Hampi , a sacred site for Hindus which they are supposed to visit at least once in their lives , who have never left their village before but saved every penny to could to make the trip there , sleeping in the streets and living off cheap street food , made me feel ashamed about my complaints about the too thin mattress on the bed in our basic yet clean $3 per night guesthouse . Back home in their villages these pilgrims usually do n't  have running water or a solid , concreted floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw women with big buckets on their heads , on their way to a well to get the water they needed to do laundry and dishes . <p> People of India <p> When I was stuck on an overcrowded train that for the first time I realized what cattle class actually means , with one person in our group in tears and the rest of us on the verge of them , I could n't help but think I am so glad that I do n't  have to do that every day. But it is the reality for hundreds of millions of Indians . I watched women doing dishes and laundry in dirty river water where at the same time an elephant released himself while being bathed ; men were shaving and women washing their hair , because this natural pool is the only tub they have . <p> And there I was , complaining that our guesthouse did n't  have hot water . These things just stick with you and you 'll never take anything for granted anymore : running water , hot water , a toilet with a flush button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being able to drink water from a tap . Comfy beds , a kitchen , a washing machine , a dish washer and other appliances seem somewhat absurd after what you see in India . India changes your perspective on everything , and makes the things you complain about in your daily life seem pretty laughable . I came back a different person than the one I was before , and I cant wait to go back to India . Because if you are willing to put up with the strenuous aspects of the country , you 'll be rewarded with the most memorable travel experience of your life . 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 32 Comments <p> I feel this ! I just left a few weeks ago to Thailand and I have to say after India travel has never seemed easier . If you survive India , you can survive anywhere . I was in the same boat as you I had already spent a bit of time in Central and South America and did n't  think much would phase me in the way of chaos/pollution/poverty and anything else associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on an unrivalled level . And despite all of this it was a country I missed before I 'd even left Delhi airport . Ill be back ! <p> India is by far the most life-changing place Ive been . Not much of a secret though since I have n't left for 2 years . I do n't  see many people writing about it , so its so nice to read this &amp; get others perspectives on my new home ! Its sad to say , I do n't  notice a lot of the things you mention as they 've just become part of life now , but I can remember when I was shocked my many of the things . <p> I cant believe you 've been there for two years already ! Wow , respect = I know how tough India can be . How long do you think you 'll be staying there ? No plans to leave any time soon , I suppose ? = <p> You said it . There is no place like India . No country has a more transformational effect on travellers . It certainly changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set it in a whole new direction .

I am a daily reader but sometimes miss articles like this that are brand new but pushed to the very bottom , making it seem like new content has not been added . Just a friendly suggestion , as I think you might get more hits by moving new articles to the top . Best , <p> Amazing Dani . I am heading to India for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited . I really do n't  want to hate it and I hope I can see past the shocking to the amazing . I think it will be a big challenge for me as I can be a control freak and I know that I will have to let go here I just hope that I can <p> Dani , A wonderful piece , thank you for writing it you 're so right about everything . I got back to northern India yesterday after an amazing trip to Nepal . I got a new six-month visa so when I leave next time , I will have spent a total of three years of my life in this country ! The West ( Oz ) is calling loudly now , but I have such immense gratitude for this country , for the things I have learnt and the way I have grown . India has completely and utterly changed who I am , changed my life and changed the way I view the world . The potential is huge if we just open up to it , let go of our western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and places like Hampi are just about as magic as they get a very special place for me and I look forward to getting back down there soon maybe see you there ! <p> Thanks so much for the kind words , Melody ! I cant believe you 'll be leaving India Oz will be such a culture shock for you , do n't  you think ? Let 's see how long you last there before you return to India = Three years in India is a lot , but like you said it does change the way you view the world and that alone is so worth a visit ! Enjoy Australia when you get there , and your remaining time in India of course ! <p> Its interesting to read this from a new angle . We moved to India last year and are , literally , rediscovering this place . My husband is German and he s used to this land ( on most days ) but when we have family or friends visiting from abroad , I get to see some of what you talk about here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken an absolute dislike to this land and will never return , some keep coming back . Each to his own , we love it here and making the most of our time now . <p> Pratibha- I feel like India is one of the very few countries people have a really strong opinion on . Most people either love it or hate it , but nobody is just like meh . Are you planning on staying in India for a long time ( forever ? ) or is it just a temporary move ? <p> Thanks so much , Jan , I am happy to hear that = It should be compulsory to visit India , really ! ! I know quite a few complainers whod never complain about anything again after spending some time in India = <p> What a great perspective Dani ! India has always intrigued me for travel , but I definitely feel equal amounts of fear and excitement at the thought of visiting . Just reading the part about the people touching your hair gave me chills though maybe I have a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks , Mike ! India is quite an intimidating place to visit . Do n't  worry too much about people touching your hair though , unless you 're blonde- then you might consider dying it for the duration of your stay in India = Its challenging but rewarding at the same time I say Go for it ! ! <p> Really India is a very nice country . there are many languages in India . it is a very excited matter . a lot of travelling and historical places there . but poverty is a great problem there . but overall it is an excellent country . <p> I am happy that you do find India life changing .. I am sure you enjoyed your visit .. And even though it was last year you still have some memories to cherish upon . I am currently visiting Latin America .. to be exact Santiago Chile Was just going through several website and found your article of **41;304;TOOLONG .. Liked it .. This is my second travel here ..

We just returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed ) and a week side trip to Kerala in the south . I will never take for granted what we have here In Canada or our neighbor to the south ever again . Ever ! India is a country of extremes : extreme beauty the Taj Mahal , Amber Fort , Akshardham temple , elephants beauty beyond anything I have seen anywhere else in the world , or even imagined in my wildest dreams . Combine this with a people who are generous , welcoming , extremely well educated and very curious , and mix in incredulous poverty , and a tendency for resolving issues with extreme violence ( we never felt physically threatened but I had to stop reading the Times newspaper as I found this quite disturbing day after day ) and you have India a country of extremes that will challenge many of your beliefs . It will no doubt take a little time to digest the experience but I am confident in saying my wife , my two daughters and I will be much stronger for having taken this journey together ! <p> Paul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're saying ; everything is so true especially that part I will never take for granted what we have here In Canada or our neighbor to the south ever again . Ever ! That 's exactly how I felt when I returned from India . It is great to hear that you got to experience it with your family and you know that they can relate to all of it . Indias hard to explain to people who have n't been there . <p> I loved reading this , Its so true ! ! I have just returned from India and after a few days of being back at work have decided that after my contract is up I am quitting my job to travel the world , I have 11 months to save up . I can not wait ! <p> Thanks for such a good article . I heard the same comment from my other international friends also . I an Indian , but being an Indian hardly we see the India . Sometime I get to know new facts about India from international friends or the travel blogs.I m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that I do n't  know much about cultural stuff of North East India or Extreme North West part . <p> When I do travel in India I do face problems in Language , food and Cultural differences .

So would love to host you for lunch or Dinner whenever you Visit India or especially Delhi . <p> Hai Dany . Its Very interesting blog . Thanks for visited to India . I am from Karnataka and by seeing the pictures I think you have just visited the northern part of Karnataka and may experienced dirtiness .

@@107143083 @2543083/ <h> The Day I Cycled Down Bolivias Death Road <p> A road where 200 to 300 people are killed every year . Let me repeat this : 200 to 200 people EVERY YEAR . When I read about the Death Road for the first time , I felt distressed , and was freaked out about traveling on this narrow road when we would make it to Bolivia . Officially known as the Yungas Road , it winds through the mountains from Bolivia 's Yungas region all the way down to Coroico in the jungle region of the Amazon . The road , which is not even asphalted , is actually not very long " only 43 miles ( 69 km ) , and yet , there have been so many accidents that it is lined with crosses . Entire buses and trucks dropped off the cliffs regularly , never to be seen again . This is how the road earned the dubious title of the World 's Most Dangerous Road in 1995 . <p> When we started to plan our trip through South America , I found out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road " an agonizing leisurely 40-miles ( 64 kilometers ) bike ride along the 2,000 feet ( 600 meter ) deep cliffs , surrounded by lush green mountains and what was supposed to be some of Bolivias most stunning scenery . I was terrified and intrigued at the same time . <p> I later learned that the original Death Road had been replaced by a new , safer ( asphalted ! ) road several years ago and was mainly used by thrill-seeking cyclists these days . Car traffic was apparently minimal so the deal was sealed . The thought of cycling down this road did n't seem as terrifying anymore now that I knew that I could n't collide with a truck or bus . Of course I could still drop off a cliff , since most of the road does n't have any guard rails , but I figured with some caution I would be fine . When the road was still in heavy use , the main reason for accidents was that in many spots it was too narrow for two vehicles to pass each other at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to fall off . <h> A leisurely bike ride along a 2,000 feet deep cliff <p> And so I found myself in a minivan leaving La Paz for the mountains on a gloomy morning , along with a few other travelers who were stupid brave enough to take on the Death Road . Our group of foolish daredevils consisted of Jess and me , a German couple , a French couple , a Bolivian couple , a young American solo traveler and a Brazilian guy . <p> We started at La Cumbre , the highest point of the mountain range at 15,320 feet ( 4,670m ) . Our end point would be in Coroico , 12,000 feet lower than La Cumbre , at 2,950 feet ( 900 meters ) a crazy difference in altitude ! We even had been told to bring bikinis to relax in a swimming pool in tropical surroundings after the ride " something that seemed completely ridiculous when we were shivering up on top of the mountain in the cold of the early morning . <p> We were fitted into our gear " a jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a full-face helmet , tested our mountain bikes ( the brakes worked great , which was excellent news ! ) and off we went . For the first 20 kilometers we did n't cycle on the actual Death Road , but on the new asphalt road to Coroico , to get used to the bikes . This part should have been an easy ride , but it was so foggy that you could barely see anything . I prayed that the fog would lift by the time we 'd reach the Death Road . What if we were n't even able to see the steep drop ? <h> Fog and rain " nightmare #1 <p> In terms of actual cycling , this part turned to be easy , since we basically just rolled down the mountain while holding down the brakes . At this point we were so cold that our fingers were completely stiff from holding on to the brakes so hard . <p> The weather gods did n't seem to be on our side that day " as if the fog was not enough , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain for an hour and getting close to freezing to death before even reaching the Death Road , we stopped for a snack in a little village while the bikes were loaded up on the van . The next 8 kilometers were uphill , and since it was pouring now , we got to ride in the van for a few minutes . <p> Then we arrived at the original Death Road . The fog had lifted , and we could see the road snake along the mountainside for miles , with imposing cliffs on the left side of the road . I started to feel a little uneasy , especially when our guide told us that we 'd be riding on the left " the cliff " side of the road ! This is the only road in Bolivia with left-hand traffic , the reason for this being that drivers who ride on the left see the cliff ( since the steering wheel is still on the left side ) , and drivers who come up the road see how close they 're to the mountainside . <h> Oncoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also learned that since a landslide had covered part of the new road eleven months ago and the clean-up was still ongoing , trucks and local cars were using the death road again ! This meant there would be oncoming traffic . I have to admit that had I known this before , I would probably NOT have signed up for the tour . I felt a bit better when our guide announced : This is a tour , not a race . Take your time and enjoy the scenery . ' After being passed by some of the other tour groups , I realized that they saw this ride as a race , speeding down the hill as if it was about making it first over the finish line rather than alive and in one piece . <p> Luckily the rain had stopped , and so we started the ride in good spirits . Every time I dared to look down to my left , it resulted in my heart racing and sweaty palms . The drop was unbelievably steep , and you could n't see the bottom . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time our guides took photos of all of us , since we were too busy holding on to the brakes and our camera gear was in the van that was following slowly behind us . After riding for a while we were even relaxed enough to pose for some goofy photos at the edge . <h> Not one , but two accidents <p> The scariest moments were when cyclists of another group tried to pass us . There were eleven or twelve groups with around ten cyclists each , which means in total , well over one hundred people were biking down the road that day ( and every other day of the year , in fact ) . We were supposed to yell Passing on your left ' or Passing on your right ' when overtaking other cyclists , but not all of them did that when they passed us . Some would just appear scarily close to my right seemingly out of nowhere , at lightening speed , causing rocks to fly against my bike , which can result in ugly accidents . <p> Our group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding slower in the back with the Bolivian couple , and while one guide was riding with the daredevils of the group , the other guide was always in the back with us . The other six were much more daring than we were and were always way ahead of us whenever you could see the road ahead of us on a less winding part , they were nowhere to be seen . <p> After about two thirds of the way , we rode on a flat part for a while " the first time all day that we had to use our pedals ! Most of the time we just sat on the bike and hit the brakes hard , trying not to go over the edge . Because there are so many curves on the way , the cars that come up the road usually honk before turning around a corner . At some point , a car turned around the corner so suddenly that the sound of honk took me by such surprise that I hit the brakes too hard " and I flew over the handlebars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to catch the bike before it went over , making this an incident without a tragic outcome ( except for me being terribly shaken up with visions of me on a rock at the bottom of the mountain ) . <p> Not long after that , I heard a loud crash behind me and when I turned around , I saw Jess on the ground , her bike upside down in the slope next to her . It turned out that she had also been lucky and the accident looked much worse than it was " a minute later she was back in the saddle and raced towards the end , having become much more comfortable than me on the bike . <p> A few minutes later , we arrived at the main road " we had survived the Death Road ! Not quite accident-free , but we lived . <p> All of the Death Road cycling tours include a buffet lunch at a hotel with a swimming pool in the valley , and our group celebrated our survival over some beers and lunch " though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than the two to three hours we 'd been told to cycle down the road . <h> The Death Toll Is Still Rising <p> Before we drove back to La Paz , our guide told us that the day before , a guy had gone over the edge " he lived , but was in the hospital with several broken bones . He had cycled with a company called Overdose , whose group we had met briefly early in the morning , and we were n't surprised to hear that it was this company " they were among those cyclists that were racing down the road at full speed . We learned that in addition to the thousands of people who had died in cars and buses on the Yungas Road , 21 cyclists and 5 guides have died since the road had been opened for mountain bike trips . It might not be the most dangerous road in the world anymore , but it is still the Death Road . <h> Tips on surviving the death road <p> Keep in mind that even though between one and two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also occur on a daily basis . <p> Make sure to choose a tour company that provides you with full safety gear , especially a full-face helmet . The most expensive tour company , Gravity , only provides vests and not always full-face helmets " you can read here what this can result in . <p> Cycle at your own pace and be careful when passing other cyclists . <p> Do n't try to take pictures while cycling ! That is one of the most common reasons for accidents . <p> Check Tripadvisor for the latest reviews for the company of your choice before booking your trip . <h> Our tour company <p> We went with Vertigo Biking , and were happy with the service they provided . The bikes ( Haro mountain bikes ) were excellent and I was thankful for the full-face helmet . <p> Vertigo charges 480 Bolivianos ( US$70 ) for the Death Road trip , which includes a snack , full lunch buffet , a T-Shirt and a CD with all photos of the day . <p> Would you cycle down the Death Road ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner of an I survived the Death Road T-Shirt , too ? <p> *** <h> Thanks to our guide Kenneth for taking some great shots of our group ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Well done for doing this ! I have read a lot about these trips and I go back and forth between whether I want to do this on my trip to South America . I think I just would n't be confident enough on the bike . I do n't  even like riding my bike on the roads when there 's not a cliff around ! <p> Loved this article , I 'm a fellow death road survivor ! Its amo nice you were in a small group , my group had about 35 people in it which I thought was too much ( I paid the same as you ) . It was a great one time experience , but I would never do it again ! <p> I loved biking the Death Road ! My favourite part was actually the first paved downhill road before reaching the Death Road . I love zooming down paved roads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started off slow on the death road but after teh first stop I gained my confidence and was in the middle of the pack rather than the back . My tip would be to not break hard as you can skid out and go over the edge , if you slowly slow down before getting to a corner there is much less chance you will skid on the loose gravel . We stayed a couple of nights in Coroico after and its a great little town too . <p> The paved part wouldve been so nice had it not been so cold and foggy when we did it . I knew that I should n't have hit the brakes so hard but because the honking caught me by such surprise I was too stunned to remember it in that moment = I wish we wouldve spent a couple of nights in Coroico as well I could n't believe how tropical it was down in the valley compared to La Paz ! Such a short distance away , yet so different . <p> Wow ! I am so intrigued by this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  know if I would be brave enough to attempt this , though it sounds awesome . I 'm not very graceful on a bike . <p> It felt like an accomplishment to SURVIVE , Miquel ! = There were quite a few people who werent very experienced on a bike but they still could n't resist the thrill . Or they got talked into it by their partner = <p> Yes , I had no idea there were still so many accidents on the road , Dale . However , having seen how fast some of the cyclists race down the road , it does n't  surprise me ! It seemed like many of them did n't  value their lives very much . <p> That in insane ! Part of me wants to say that of course I would do it my boyfriend is really into cycling and this would be right up his alley . But the other part of me knows how terrified I would be the entire time ! <p> Brave or simply stupid ? ! I am definitely glad I did n't  look up too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accidents sound horrifying ! I wish the road was a little bit safer ( or less idiots on it ! ) because the scenery was simply amazing . <p> Death Road is definitely a must do when in Bolivia . I did n't  do the ride but took a bus from La Paz to Amazon Basin 12 hours along the road . Oh we what an adventure let 's just say on the way back decided to spend the money and fly . Glad you got to experience that adventure though . <p> I have tickets to fly to Bolivia this January over my winter break . I had fully intended to go biking on Death Road , however , I also read that it is the rainy season at that time so it would be very dangerous . Has anyone else done it in early January ? <p> I do n't  know how independent travelers get to the start of the road , because all the tour companies who offer the ride arrange transportation from La Paz to the start of the Death Road ( mini vans ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is a great piece , I am just researching now for our family trip later this year . I would love to do Deat Road although it scares the bejeezus outta me . I have two boys who will be 16 and 17 when we go . tell me honestly what are your thoughts about going with teenagers ? <p> Great post and advice ! I just did the Death Road yesterday and had a fantastic time . I admit I was a lot more scared than necessary at first but then relaxed . That is , until two people on our tour were taken away on ambulances . Yikes ! Wonderful tips and glad you survived ! ! I hope you do n't  mind but I linked your blog on my own about the Death Road = Thanks again ! <p> PS . I think its important to know that 200-300 people do n't  die anymore on the road . That was the case in the 80s but between the new road and guard rails , things have vastly improved . Since dangerous though ( as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wow ! ! That 's insane , what happened to them ? A bad fall ? I am so glad you survived ! I have to re-read my article .. I thought I had made it clear that those are the numbers of people who used to die there , but not anymore . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143084 @2543084/ <h> Five reasons to visit St Martin <p> A couple of weeks ago , I almost bought a plane ticket to Martinique . Why ? First of all , I figured a Caribbean getaway from New York in January , around the time when the first blizzard usually hits , seemed like a fabulous idea . Second ? I stumbled upon flight tickets for $79 ! To one of the Caribbean islands furthest away from New York an absolute steal . It was hard to resist , but I tried to figure out how to get to Colombia from there ( take a look at the map- its pretty close to Martinique ) , where I 'll be spending the winter , and could n't find a flight that did n't  go back through the U.S. Theres always the option to rent a private jet though , if money is not an issue , and it makes me wonder how much it would cost to rent a private jet . <p> Researching the island and looking into what to do there got me looking into other Caribbean island getaways though seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , therell be plenty of chances for island getaways and I should take advantage of the cheap airfare from New York to the Caribbean while I 'm there . Another island nation that caught my eye ? St Martin ! The island looks like a picture perfect Caribbean dream , - and when I found private St. Martin villa rentals on the beach , I knew right away which of my New York girls I 'd invite to join me for this island retreat . Why did St Martin catch my eye ? I 'll give you five good reasons to visit St Martin shortly , but let me give you a brief overview of this Caribbean nation first.The island is located about 200 miles east of Puerto Rico , and sits just south of Anguilla ( only a 30 min boat ride away ! ) . Its a relatively small island ( 33.59- mi- ) and it is divided in two parts : Saint Martin , the French side in the north , and Sint Maartin , the Dutch side on the southern part of the island . The island has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each- side has a very different feel to it . The Dutch side is notably more developed and touristy with lots of resorts and casinos , while the French side feels sleepier and more natural . <h> Here are five reasons why you should visit St Martin : <p> 37 white sand beaches <p> Despite the islands compact size , it offers a whopping 37 beaches ! All come with white , powdery sand and the inviting turquoise waters that the Caribbean is famous for . Mullet Bay is often regarded as the most beautiful one , but you can find a full listing of all 37 beaches with detailed descriptions here . <p> Visit two European nations <p> Since Sint Maartin , the southern part , is part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Saint Martin in the north is an overseas collectivity of France , you 'll basically get to visit two European nations ! The French side uses Euros as their currency , the Dutch side Netherlands Antilles Guilder . There are two different capitals , and you have to call internationally from one side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest island in the world that is divided into two nations.The culinary capital of the Caribbean <p> St Martin might be tiny , but it has over 300 restaurants ! The island is known for its excellent cuisine and there are quite a few gourmet restaurants on the island . But no matter if you 're looking to dine fine or sample local cuisine from a shack on the beach you 'll love the combination of local Caribbean flavors and European culinary influences . Plus , there 's a surprising number of international restaurants on the island as well . Thai ? Indian ? Mediterranean ? You can sample a different cuisine every night of your stay ! Fodors has some great restaurants recommendations for St Martin . <p> Maho Bay : A spectacle for plane watchers <p> Its very likely that you 've seen photos of Maho Bay , a beach on the Dutch side of the island that is famous for its spectacular plane landings and take-offs . Whenever a large plane arrives in St Martin , the plane flies so low over the beach that it seems like people can almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin and every visitor who 's even just a little bit fascinated by planes visits this beach at least once to witness a take-off or landing . <p> Scuba paradise <p> St Martin is a paradise for scuba diving you can do just about any dive you want here . Wreck dives , night dives , reef dives or cave dives all possible here . One wreck that 's particularly noteworthy is the- 1770 British warship- HMS- Proselyte , which sank in 1801. - If you 're not into diving , then there 's fantastic snorkeling along the island reefs which have been declared an underwater nature reserve . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143085 @2543085/ <h> My most valuable travel gear : pickpocket-proof clothes <p> You might remember that I 've raved about my Clever Travel Companion pickpocket-proof underwear before , but to refresh your memory : I 've traveled with my pick-pocket proof tank top and my boy short style boxers for over two years now and they 're still holding up strong ! The boxers have two little pockets in the front , each of which got a credit card or two and cash . The hidden pocket in the tank top even fits my passport . When do I wear them ? Usually when I travel on night buses or know that I 'll be arriving somewhere really late . Where in the world ? That does n't  matter . <p> The first thing I was told when I arrived in Berlin in August was that people are not only pick-pocketed anymore , but also held at knife point until they give up their bags . Particularly in the Warschauer Strasse area in Friedrichshain , where a lot of hostels are . <p> As for night buses : I tend to use them more often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have my underwear on a night bus from Germany to Copenhagen earlier this year . Pickpockets are everywhere , not just in third world countries . All of Europe has become somewhat of a pickpocket hotspot in recent years , no matter if its Paris ( be vigilant around the Eiffel Tower especially ! ) , Lisbon , Rome and on trains so if you 're like me doing an interrail trip around Europe , make sure you have an eye on your belongings . <p> The latest additions to Clever Travel Companions clothing line , a T-shirt and leggings ( they 're about to launch in a few weeks , I cant wait to get a pair ! ) are perfect for my train trip , for example : i might need access to some of the valuables I store in the hidden pockets , but wearing the tank top underneath a shirt ( otherwise the rather large pocket is visible ) and the boxers underneath my pants , it would be pretty difficult to get to them.This is why the T-shirt with the pretty big pocket on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my tank top ) is perfect for train trips . The pocket is big enough to hold a small wallet or credit cards and cash and is truly hard to spot I 'd almost go as far as saying it is invisible to those who do n't  know that its there . <p> Like I said , I 've owned my underwear for over two years now and not only am I still using them , but they are also still in a very good condition , considering that I , as a full-time traverse , most likely use them more often than the average traveler . <p> At between $24.90 and $34.90 per item , I find the clothes absolutely fair priced , considering the durable quality of the products . <p> The Clever Travel Companion accompanies me on all of my trips and gets the Globetrottergirls stamp of approval ! 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143086 @2543086/ <h> 16 Favorite Travel Moments Of 2016 <p> 2016 was an interesting year , with travels I did n't  see coming at all , and visits to places I had on my travel wish list but did n't  think I 'd go to this year . I terribly failed at my travel wish list out of the ten places I wanted to visit , I only made it to one ( Colombia ) . <p> 2016 was the year I started off by saying I really want to slow down ( see : The Evolution Of A Nomad ) , but then I ended up traveling more than in previous years . Even though I only visited six countries , my time in the US was spent between five states , and I ended up on 23 flights ( from one place to another , not counting connecting flights ) , which means I took about two flights per month.I tried to add up the number of beds I slept in and came up with 82 , but to be honest , I may have forgotten a couple . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , and at least 12 beds more than in 2015 , even though I visited less countries this year down from 15 countries last year . I spent time in five different US states , however , I spent around a month in each : Washington , New York , Arizona , Texas and California . <p> I have to admit that it was n't easy to narrow it down to 16 favorite moments , because I 've had special moments in each place I visited . I had to cut out Dallas , which I unexpectedly loved , my days in a beach hotel in Brighton this past summer which I scored thanks to Dealsland , a month in Seattle with so many moments I cherished , or my awesome weekend in Cologne in July . <p> I shared the details of each month 's ups and downs in my monthly round-ups , but here are my top 16 travel moments of 2016 as a whole : <h> 16 Ice skating in Manhattan <p> There are only two things in New York City that get me excited for winter : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago ) and the ice rinks . Despite spending all of December in New York last year , I never found someone to go ice skating with . This year , I finally made it to Bryant Park for an ice skating session , and if I end up spending next winter in New York , I 'll definitely invest in skates " so much fun ! <h> 15 Visiting the Amazon <p> When I mapped out my time in Colombia , I decided not to visit the Amazon , simply because it was a bit of a hassle to get down there ( only accessible by plane ) and I felt like it was n't a good place for a solo traveler . When a friend I met on my travels through the country happened to fly down to Leticia though and invited me to tag along , I did n't have to think twice . I was going to the Amazon ! Soaking up life in small villages along the Amazon ( only accessible by boat ) was an amazing experience , and seeing the seemingly endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Amazon and seeing pink river dolphins were the icing on the cake . <h> 14 The Sweet SoCal Life <p> Last year , I spent a few days in L.A. my first visit to Southern California since 2010 and even though it was only a brief visit , it was one of my 2015 favorite travel moments . This year , I was lucky enough to return to SoCal , and ended up spending over a month there , three weeks of which were housesitting for my friend Jen in Long Beach . Looking after her pup Henry was such a treat , and I loved getting a taste of the sweet Cali life : runs on the beach , going for drives along the Pacific Coast Highway , and exploring L.A.s neighborhoods . I feel extremely lucky that I got to spend so much time in this beautiful State . <h> 13 A day in Rome <p> I only had one full day in Rome after my week-long hike through Umbria and Latium , but I sure made the most of it . I wandered around Trastevere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some of my favorite landmarks ( the Colosseum , the Pantheon and Trevi Fountain ) , I had tasty pizza and gelato , and even got to see the papal audience . <h> 12 Beach hopping along Mexico 's Pacific Coast <p> I 've seen so much of Mexico in the past few years , but for some reason , I never made it to the popular Riviera Nayarit . This year , I finally made it to the famous Pacific beaches and beach hopped between Sayulita , San Pancho and Puerto Vallarta . I loved each place for different reasons , and was happy to enjoy beach town living for a few weeks . My routine there was simple , but it gave me so much joy : a few hours of work in the morning followed by a jungle hike or a SUP session , an hour at the beach with a good book and watching the sunset with a cold beer . <h> 11 Christmas Markets in Germany <p> I admit it : I am not the biggest fan of winter in Germany . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sun comes up at 8am and disappears at 4pm " if it shows itself at all . But one thing that got me excited about spending the Holidays with my family ? The Christmas Markets ! There 's just nothing like a German Christmas Market with mulled wine , sugar roasted nuts and other Christmas Market foods , seeking out gifts and catching up with friends over a glass of hot eggnog. <h> 10 Living in Mexico City <p> Mexico City was n't on my travel wish list for 2016 , and not in a million years would I have thought that I 'd end up there this year . But as so often happens , a life of travel often brings you to some unexpected crossroads , and I chose the road to Mexico City in March . Living there for a few weeks allowed me to revisit all of my favorite museums , neighborhoods and art galleries , and thanks to my local friends I got to know some new cool hangouts . Settling into a routine of work in my favorite coffee shop during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could 've stayed for much longer , but the Yucatan was calling ( see #2 ) . <h> 9 Summer in New York City <p> I was really bummed out when I learned that I had to travel to Germany for a couple of months this year , which meant missing out on my favorite time in New York : the summer . Luckily enough I was able to spend at least a month there in August ( after a short week at the beginning of June ) and tried to make up for lost time in those four weeks : a weekend getaway to Fire Island , the food markets , picnics in the park , outdoor movies , and even kayaking on the Hudson River . There 's just no place I 'd rather be in the summer than New York . <h> 8 Playing tour guide in Berlin <p> I ended up playing tour guide in Berlin three times this year , and each time I visit the city , I fall in love with it a little bit more . Spending time in Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that meant I could show my visitors all my favorite things there : sunset picnics in Tempelhof Airport ( sans planes ) , al fresco dining in Kreuzberg , strolls along the canal , bike rides through Tiergarten Park , flea markets , self-guided street art walks , beach bars and cheap wine bars , drinks with a view at Klunkerkranich , bar hopping in Friedrichshain , and I even happened to be in town for the Gay Pride Street Fest . <h> 7 Hiking in Southern Arizona <p> I love my annual trips to Southern Arizona and I hope I 'll get to go in 2017 , too . This year , two friends visited Tucson while I was there , which was the perfect excuse for several desert hikes . If you 've been reading Globetrottergirls for a while , you 'll know that I ca n't get enough of the desert , and especially the Sonoran Desert with its ginormous Saguaro Cacti. <h> 6 A month in Austin <p> 2016 was the year I finally made it to Austin " a city that has been high on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not disappoint ! In fact , it turned out to be a city I loved so much that I 'd consider moving there . So far , I thought NYC was the only U.S. city I could see myself live in , but Austin charmed me with its incredible live music scene , the countless food trucks , craft brew bars and coffee shops that serve beer . I loved how active the city was , with people kayaking and SUPing on the river at all times , and the lovely running and walking paths along the river and in the Greenbelt . Plus a bunch of other things which you can read here : 33 Things I Love About Austin <h> 5 Beach time in Isla Mujeres <p> When I got to Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula in April , I had n't been to a beach since January , when I beach hopped along Colombia 's Caribbean Coast . I also had n't taken any time off in a while , which is why I was beyond excited when the ferry pulled into the small ferry port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Cancun . I had n't been to the island since 2010 , but I 'd never forgotten the pristine beaches and crystal clear Caribbean waters . Spending a few days there after my Mexican road trip ( another 2016 highlight ! ) felt like heaven . Read more here : Isla Mujeres Finding Paradise in Mexico <h> 4 New Mexico 's White Desert <p> This was n't my first time in New Mexico 's White Desert " I went there on my New Mexico road trip in 2013 and loved this spectacular desert with its white sands . When I decided to road trip from Tucson to Austin I knew I had to plan in a short detour to stop there again . Last time I visited in the morning , so this time I wanted to be there in the afternoon , for golden hour and for sunset , and my plan worked out . It was , just like the first time , an incredible experience , and I loved that because of the late hour of our visit , we had the desert almost all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hiking through the Italian countryside ? I did n't have to think long when the opportunity for this trip arose , and I loved every minute of it . We stopped in small quaint mountain towns along the way , hiked through vineyards and ate copious amounts of pasta each night . This was definitely one of the most epic hiking trips I 've ever done . <h> 2 A Yucatan road trip <p> The Yucatan will always be my favorite region in Mexico , no doubt ! So when my favorite travel companion and I decided to go on another trip together ( after two weeks of backpacking in Colombia in January ) and she wanted to explore Mexico , I put together an epic Yucatan road trip for us , which would introduce her to cenotes and Caribbean beaches , Maya ruins and my favorite Spanish-colonial town in Mexico : Valladolid . We even snorkeled with sea turtles ! The trip went exceptionally well and I 'd do it again in a heartbeat. <h> 1 The jungle trek to Colombia 's Lost City <p> I 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it in 2010 . Funnily enough , I am not sure if I would 've had the guts to do it had I visited Colombia in 2011 , as I 'd originally planned when I set out on my round-the-world trip in 2010 . Traveling to Colombia solo and challenging myself to hike through the jungles and the mountains for a few days showed me how much my travel style has evolved over the past few years . I was so proud when , after the four-day hike , which culminated in the climb of over 1,000 stairs to reach the ruins of an ancient city , I finally set foot in the fabled Lost City ' in the Sierra Nevada mountains . Even though this hike was a trip where you 'd say it was equally as much about the journey as it was about the destination , I found the Lost City much more impressive than I thought I would . <p> I ca n't wait to see which adventures 2017 will bring , but I am ready for another epic year of travel .

@@107143087 @2543087/ <h> How to combine Long-Term Travel and Work <p> When I semi-spontaneously decided to go on a round-the-world trip in February 2010 , such a quick decision was only possible because I was already freelancing and so I was able to pack up and take my projects on the road with me . Why sit idly by at home slaving away when I could be out experiencing the world at the same time , I thought . Combining round-the-world , long-term travel with work means that I have a guaranteed income , but on the other hand it means that I had to plan our travels around our work schedule . So , how is that working out , you ask ? <p> Seven years into a work-travel lifestyle , I can say that digital nomadism ' is definitely a feasible option but only if you know from the outset that you will be traveling slowly . For those on a fixed schedule who can or want to only spend six months or a year on the road , fitting in a full work schedule with sightseeing and travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It took me a long time to find my rhythm , which involves traveling AND working AND blogging , but I have found that if you follow a few simple rules , you 'll have no problem of combining work and travel : <h> Prioritize <p> Keeping clients happy is priority number one , as work means money and money means longer travel . This can be hard with a Caribbean sunset beckoning you on the beach , but no matter how long it takes to finish , work must come first . I work mainly on deadline-focused projects , and so I usually finish up what we 're working on before heading out to explore a place , or take full days in my AirBnb working away when we would rather be sitting on a plaza somewhere watching the world go by . <h> Schedule <p> It helps enormously to schedule your days . List what you want to achieve and make a plan to hit your targets . Plan what time you need to start and finish work in order to keep in perspective how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy travel phase , I prefer to spend whole days working and whole days playing where possible . When I stay somewhere for an extended period of time ( two weeks , a month ) I can better schedule working mornings and exploring ( or beach ! ) afternoons . <h> Get up early <p> For those who have taken a year just to travel , sleeping in or sleeping off a hard night come with the territory . When you have undertaken a work/travel lifestyle , however , starting work on time each day is a must . We found that starting to work as early as 7 am enables us to fit so much more into a day . Because we both work for Europe-based clients and we are located in Latin America at the moment , it is important for us to get up as early as possible in order to be online when our clients are online . <h> Discipline <p> While it 's true that all work and no play makes a dull traveler , adopting a lifestyle as a digital nomad means that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Sure you would rather be out exploring than sitting in front of a laptop screen . Sure the people in the hostel are partying it up and having a great time while you struggle to meet a deadline for a client thousands of miles away . In order to travel and work , however , you have to stay strong and focus on your need to work to continue your income stream . Some people might just say f ! ck it ' and join the party , but if you want be successful in the long-term , you need the discipline to get your work done . Tell yourself that this is a lifestyle , not a gap year . Plus , if you schedule your time right and find your rhythm , you should be able to join the party anyway ! <h> Things to consider for a successful travel-work lifestyle <p> Laptop &amp; cloud desktops <p> When purchasing a laptop for your digital nomad life , choose wisely . My main criteria : battery life ( because there are n't  always power outlets ) , weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe with me ! ) , operating system ( I am a Windows girl ) , 2-in-1 ( laptops that can be turned into tablets honestly , I prefer having a separate tablet ) , size ( since I only write , I do n't  need a huge screen , but I know several people who work with graphics who need larger screens ) , and then there are of course components like processor , hard drive , RAM and graphics chip . <p> Another thing to consider : cloud storage . Never rely on external hard drives . I learned this the hard way , when two of my hard drives crashed . Now , I store all my important documents online . When you want to combine work with travel , these two Cloud services are precious online Windows Desktops from CloudDesktopOnline.com and- online portal to share files , calendars , contacts , and tasks from CloudAppsPortal.com. - Internet / wi-fi <p> I would say 99% of all digital nomads rely on the internet , so make sure that the place you 're staying has reliable wi-fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of a telephone conference via Skype or not being able to attach the documents you 're supposed to send because of a weak connection " ten minutes before deadline . This need does limit your accommodation choices but with some research before heading to the next place you will always find an apartment that has wi-fi . <p> Plan in extra time <p> Plans are always a nice thing to have , but most of the time , things do n't work out exactly as you thought . The best thing to plan in is extra time . Taking into account things like slow internet connections , broken down buses , noisy neighbors and the fact that maybe you DID just say f ! ck it last night and joined the party , your work might take longer than you think to finish . Scheduling more time than might seem initially necessary to complete a project creates a buffer against the factors that are out of your control . That way , should everything go right , you 're far ahead of deadline , thus keeping clients very satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still manage to meet your deadline and your clients are none the wiser . <p> If you are currently on the road and live the lifestyle of a digital nomad , feel free to share your tips how to successfully combine travel &amp; work in the comments below ! <p> Getting up early is the hardest but seriously one of the best ways to be successful in whatever you do !

@@107143093 @2543093/ <h> Travel Fail : How not to visit Hong Kong <p> I had it all planned out so well : three full days as a teaser in Hong Kong ( I knew I 'd be returning in the spring and wanted to see more of the city in warmer weather ) . My plans included heading up to the famous Peak for the views , taking the Star ferry ride from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island across Victoria Harbour , hiking up to the Big Buddha , exploring the hipster neighborhoods , have drinks with a view at one of the famous rooftop bars , see the nightly light show , eat dim sum at the worlds cheapest Michelin star restaurant.Instead , I failed miserably at Hong Kong . I was already off to a bad start when I found myself frantically searching online for a hotel only a few hours before my flight to Hong Kong would depart from Istanbul . What I found , did n't  look great . Prices were outrageously high and the rooms that were still available for my arrival date the following day were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of 5 stars or 5 out of 10 points , that 's bad news . I finally settled for a place in Kowloon that sounded somewhat questionable but not too shady and was close to the Avenue Of The Stars ( Hong Kongs version of the Walk Of Fame ) and the waterfront with its famous views over Hong Kong Island . I even invested in an upgrade from a 3 m- to a 5m- room , but only booked it for the first two nights in case it turned out to be terrible.By the time I exited the plane I was n't worrying about my accommodation anymore , however . I had arrived in Hong Kong on a sunny afternoon , bright blue skies and terrific views over the city from the plane . I was buzzing with excitement.I found my hotel right away , my room was bigger than expected , and the city was electrifying . I headed out to explore my neighborhood and to find some food before I settled in for work . Fail #1 : finding food . I just couldnt find anything vegetarian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea how to order something vegetarian . In the end , I only got me a coffee before I headed back to my room to catch up on work . I couldve saved me the frustration about the food fail had I just looked up a place on Foursquare before I left my hotel.Back in the hotel , I made sure NOT to beat my jet lag with the absolute rookie mistake : instead of going to bed at midnight when I should have , I stayed up because I was n't tired . Next thing I knew was that it was 6.30am ! Fail #2 . I had totally screwed myself , because now it would take me days to get into a proper rhythm . <p> What I did n't  fail at was reaching out to some locals for insider tips and some company on my first days in town , and so I found myself at a lesbian party the following night . I met a bunch of lovely expats from all over the world who were giving me some insight into the lesbian scene in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong girls apparently tend to stick to themselves ( rather than mingling with the expat girls ) and refer to themselves as sticky rice for that very reason ( who knew ! ) . The next morning , I was equipped with loads of tips for what to do and see , but I had yet to change hotels . The night before I had figured I 'd just change to another guesthouse in my building , since I was staying in one of these huge apartment blocks that had a number of hotels on each floor , and I had seen several of the other ones online as well . <p> I did n't  consider , however , that it was Saturday and everyone and their mom was coming to Hong Kong for the weekend . Fail #3 . I must have spent an hour going from floor to floor to check out every single hotel but they were all fully booked , and the 4-bed dorm I was showed in one place .. Nothankyouverymuch ! ! ! ( I am still horrified . ) I finally went to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use to see what hostels and hotels were available for the day , and my good mood disappeared immediately . There were no rooms with a decent rating left whatsoever . I finally settled on one that sounded the least horrible , and splurged on a twin bed room , because the single rooms can be seriously claustrophobic picture a narrow sort-of closet or Harry Potters Cupboard Under The Stairs at the Dursleys house that just fits a bed , and nothing else.When I saw the signs for by-the-hour hotels and all sorts of massage parlors outside the building , I already knew I would hate the place . Once I found the hotel in the maze of countless hotels inside the giant apartment block with several entrance doors , it took them an hour to check me in . By now , I had wasted nearly half a day on looking at hotel rooms , searching for a room online , moving across town , and waiting to be checked in . When I saw the room , I wanted to cry . I was pretty sure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken and i found a big pile of black hair in the shower which was right above the toilet.Instead of crying , I headed out to explore this time better prepared with a vegetarian restaurant marked on GoogleMaps and a coffee shop I wanted to check out ( what I realized is that Hong Kong has some amazing coffee shops ! ) . <p> The minute the waiter put down a jug of green tea and I took my first sip , I calmed down . I only needed to get my jet lag under control and I 'd have a splendid time in Hong Kong.However , I did n't  get my jet lag under control and I did n't  make it to half of the places on my to-see-list . If you 're wondering why most of my photos are taken in the dark .. That 's because I was awake mainly during the night . <p> In the end , I could n't be too upset , because I still had a great time and I enjoyed just taking in the city rather than rushing from tourist sight to tourist sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong had me in awe the entire time something that does n't  happen too often anymore to the jaded traveler I often tend to be after years of traveling.I know that I 'll see all the sights eventually when I return in April and I will make sure to be better prepared . And on the bright side : other than my first day , when the sun was out , it was a bit grey and cloudy during my stay so its probably better anyway that I did n't  have to rush up to the Buddha and the Peak which are all about the views.Ultimately , my time in Hong Kont taught me a few things : <p> It does n't  hurt to plan a few things and map out your visit in advance ( and not just when you 're already on the plane and realize that your South East Asia Lonely Planet does n't  include Hong Kong ! ! ) <p> Do n't  wait until the day before your arrival to book your accommodation . <p> Getting in touch with locals and meeting them is always a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place if you know someone who actually lives there . Do n't  be shy meet up with locals , and if you do n't  know anyone whatsoever , sites like WithLocals are a good idea , and so are MeetUp.com or Couchsurfing meetups . And if you 're just looking to meet other travelers , activities like a pub crawl are always fun . <p> If you only have a few days in a place with a lot to see , make still time to just meander , go with the flow , take in the vibe of the city , and not just rush from attraction to attraction . <p> Have you been to Hong Kong ? I 'd love to hear your recommendations for things I should check out on my next visit in a couple of months ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> How did I not know that you 've been to Hong Kong ? ! = I am kicking myself in the butt for not taking a photo of the coffin hotel room I was showed .

@@107143097 @2543097/ <h> The Gems of Andalusia <p> Andalusia is Spain 's largest region and you could spend months exploring it . But many visitors " particularly those from the USA tend to focus on the three cultural gems of the interior : Granada , Cordoba and Seville . You can get through all three in a 10-day itinerary , but it will be at high speed . If you can spare two weeks I 'd recommend it . Best times to visit are spring and autumn when it 's bright and sunny without the stifling heat of mid-summer and everyone seems to walk with a spring in their step and a smile on their face . Many visitors fly into Madrid and then take the high speed AVE train Cordoba which takes around 2 hours " and pick up a hire car there . <p> Sultry Seville 's must-sees Seville is a quick 90 minutes down the autopista from Cordoba . Base yourself in the bustling streets of the old town and the minute you step outside the door , you 'll be enthralled by its atmosphere . The must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still used by the King today when he 's in town . It 's a feast of rooms and cool courtyards with intricately carved ceilings and walls . <p> Close second comes the vast cathedral which dominates the skyline of the old town . Take a walk up La Giralda " the belltower " for great views over the city . I 'd also try and fit in a visit to the Casa de Pilatos or the Casa de la Condesa de Lebrija " two gorgeous private houses both stuffed with interesting artefacts and paintings . Art lovers should make time to visit the excellent Museo de Bellas Artes which is particularly good for the highly romanticised paintings of the Seville school of painters " in particular Murillo . In the evenings make sure to go to at least one flamenco show " my favourite is the paired down , simple and authentic dance and song on offer at the Casa de la Memoria . Real fans should also visit the Flamenco museum which has live evenings too . And for food " it has to be tapas " snacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold beer or a glass of wine alongside is the quintessential Seville experience . Casa Morales and Bar Europa are two of my favourites " both located in the old town . <p> Cool Cordoba 's key sights If you start your tour in Seville , you 'll find Cordoba immediately feels smaller and easier to manage . Like Seville its cathedral " the Mezquita dominates the old town and , like Seville , it 's built on the foundations of the former mosque that existed here when the region was under the control of the Moors . The difference here is that a big chunk of the mosque remains " a forest of horseshoe-shaped red and white striped arches disappears into the gloom as you step inside . Planted like some alien invader in the centre is a huge domed cathedral " a light-filled space that 's in total contrast to the Moorish elements that surround it . There really is no building like it in the world . If budget is not issue then consider doing a night visit " it 's wonderfully atmospheric . Tickets need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral courtyard . A wander around the narrow lanes of the Jewish quarter ( Juderia ) is another must-do . History buffs should check out the synagogue here one of just a handful from this era left in Spain . The nearby Casa de Sefarad recounts the history of the Jewish population of the city in more detail too . If you 're in the mood for shopping look for Taller Meryan a wonderful artisan shop selling exquisitely carved leather goods " one the specialities of the area . It 's tucked down a pretty side street called Calle de las Flores . <p> Granada 's gorgeous royal palace Granada is another three hours or so from Cordoba by road . Make sure you 've worked out how to get to your hotel before you arrive as driving around the city is a complex affair . The highlight of a visit to Andalusia awaits here . The amazingly elaborate Alhambra palace is one of Europe 's most exotic and romantic . Be warned though " unsurprisingly , it 's very popular . Book your entry ticket ahead of your arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option available here too and again , it 's well worth considering , particularly because you avoid the queues and crowds of daytime . ( But you do n't get to see the gardens if you take this option ) . The palace is a series of exquisitely decorated rooms and courtyards from the era when the Moors ruled this part of Spain . There are stunning golden domed ceilings , peaceful pools reflecting the detailed carvings on the pillars and walls that surround them and courtyards with fountains . <p> The views from some of the corridors out across the city are spectacular too . The gardens are also delightful . A series of playful water features like streams that flow down the bannisters of stairways " are particularly wonderful . Make time too to wander the old Arab Quarter . Called the Albaicin , it 's a labyrinth of narrow whitewashed housed-streets and tiny squares . Stay at a hotel here to really sample the atmosphere . There 's a real north African vibe to parts of the area in particular Calle Caldereria which is lined with atmospheric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water fountains with a perfumed cup of tea in the heat of the day . <p> Getting there You can fly to Madrid from most major UK and US airports . Cordoba has no commercial airport and there are currently no direct flights to Granada either . You can fly direct to Seville from the UK however from London Gatwick .

@@107143098 @2543098/ <h> The day I became a solo hiker in Patagonia <p> I have a confession to make " I am a terrible solo traveler , and an even worse solo hiker . I just love to share travel experiences , like that WOW ' moment when I saw the Iguazu Falls for the first time , or when I walked over the Golden Gate Bridge , saw my first Buddhist temple in Asia or the sunrise at Angkor Wat . <p> Of course these would have all been amazing experiences as a solo traveler , but it has always felt more fulfilling to share these with Jess as we travel the world . Hiking is even more of a partner activity for me , as when Jess and I set off on a hike together , somehow we always end up having the deepest conversations and discussions like the day we became mountaineers- ( well , kind of ) or cave explorers together . <p> Jess had left me on my own on a hike once before , which was the day I became a volcano climber , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a disinterest in hiking an active volcano in Guatemala . She was disappointed not to be able to hike in Patagonia , and I just was n't sure if we should visit El Chalten at all - the self-proclaimed trekking capital of Argentina and a 27 hour bus ride down from the city of Bariloche . <p> In the end , my curiosity won and we still went ahead with our plans , but decided not to stay as many days as we would have had we both been in top shape . After all , I had n't  hiked in who knew how long , and instead sampled my way through Chiles finest cakes what kind of hiker would I even be ? <p> El Chalten " A hiker 's paradise <p> From the minute we arrived and drove through El Chalten to our hostel , I knew we had made the right decision . Founded in 1985 , the tiny village serves exclusively as a base for hikers to climb the famous Fitz Roy mountain range . There is something magical about this little town , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 meters from the main road . Despite being very remote , the infrastructure is excellent ( except for the Wi-Fi ) with adorable restaurants , cafes and a wide range of hotels to choose from . Because we booked late out of- hesitation you wo n't see a Hotel Tip of the Week of ours , an overpriced collection of shipping containers converted into rooms . <p> I could n't focus on that , however , as I was going to take my first big hike the next morning and had to start looking at all the possible hikes . The options are vast " these are the main trails directly around El Chalten : <p> After reading up on the several hikes , I was torn between the hike to Laguna De Los Tres , which is supposed to be the most spectacular hike and Laguna Torre , which seems to be the most popular one . In the end I opted for the latter " after not having done any hikes in months ( and going entirely by myself ) eight hours seemed more achievable than ten hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only three hours , with the option of another hour to a viewpoint for close-up vistas of Glaciar Grande and Cerro Torre . If I could n't go any further , I would make it to the Laguna at least . I was excited for my adventure . <p> A personal challenge - <p> The next morning , my cloud of excitement had lifted a little " was I really able to do this ? Walking through town to pick up some snacks for the hike , I felt slightly out of place . I was the only person not fully kitted out in North Face hiking gear . Swarms of hikers had already set off on their hikes , equipped with walking sticks , fancy hiking pants and camel paks for optimal re-hydration , and there I was in jeans and sneakers , not having walked anywhere for more than a few hours since I could n't even remember our last hike . <p> The trail head to Laguna Torre was up on top of a steep hill west of the village and I started climbing up with quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiking skills . Five minutes in , however , I started struggling , completely out of breath and a sharp pain in my lungs . This was n't looking too good . <p> I kept pushing through there was no slowing down after having just blown past my fellow ( and possibly semi-professional ) hikers . I had let them hear me huffing and puffing up past them , completely soaked in sweat and there was no admitting defeat . Once I made it to the top of that hill , however , and continued on a level path , my body started to adjust and I was able to catch my breath but I wondered what I had gotten myself into . <p> Before I started doubting myself too much , an Argentine backpacker passed me with a 70 liter backpack , plus a sleeping mat and cooking gear dangling from his pack and I knew it was time to pull myself together and keep going . <p> And I am glad I did . With every turn , a new gorgeous view revealed itself , and the changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of a river at the bottom of the cliffs next to me , and then the trail went through a forest until the trees disappeared and gave way for the first glimpse of Glacier Largo in the far distance ( Cerro Torre was still hidden by clouds ) . The trail descended and wound through a dead forest until it met the river , followed by a rocky mountain path . And all of a sudden , a mountain lake emerged in front of me " could this be already Laguna Torre ? I checked my watch and saw that I had only been walking for two hours . As I turned around the corner , I saw big groups of hikers gathered , taking pictures of themselves , enjoying their lunch packages and others who made their way back already . <p> Not only had I made it , I had also gotten here an hour faster than expected . <p> I decided that I was definitely able to make it through the last part up to the viewpoint . The blue ice of the glacier looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but after the success of the hike so far , I had n't expected such a tough path for the last bit " I was basically walking on a narrow edge of the crater around the lake on rocks and pebbles . <p> The views made up for it in the end , and the glacier actually reminded me of the Black Glacier we had visited in Bariloche , with the right side of it completely covered in debris and brown dust . Like at the Black Glacier , the lake was filled with floating icebergs that had carved off the glacier , but compared to Perito Moreno this Glaciar Grande " despite its name " was tiny . Even though I was proud of myself for making it here and was in awe of the breathtaking views , there was something missing : my hiking buddy . Without Jess , I just could n't enjoy this hike to the fullest . <p> After breathing in the crisp mountain air and eating my picnic lunch , I turned to head back , and when I bent down at a stream to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like a true hiker ! <p> I returned beaming , bragged about my hiking skills to Jess and started making plans for the next day . I would head south and check out a couple of the shorter hikes for good views over the Fitzroy mountain range and the town of El Chalten . The hikes to Mirador De Los Condores and Mirador de las Aguilas are perfect for that and the weather forecast was for perfectly sunny weather . <p> I woke up the next morning pumped to get hiking , and both trails were easy and refreshing . I felt like a pro and wanted to stay in town and hike every trail possible " but traveling through Patagonia in high season means booking hotels days or weeks in advance , so we already had our place in El Calafate reserved and were pressed for time . <p> Patagonian hikers highlights : El Chalten vs . Torres Del Paine <p> The trip to El Chalten was surprisingly positive despite our short time there , and when compared to Torres del Paine in Chile , this hikers haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiking trails can be reached within minutes from anywhere in town and can be hiked entirely for free ! In Torres del Paine , on the other hand , hikers must base themselves in Puerto Natales ( two hours away ) and bus it in to the National Park , unless you do one of the multi-day treks which are much more intense . El Chalten has overnight hikes , too , and the camping is free , unlike Torres del Paine where staying in refugios can be very costly . If you , like us , prefer to sleep in a comfortable bed rather than in a tent ( especially in this part of Patagonia , where the weather can change within minutes ) , El Chalten is the perfect base for a trekking trip . In my opinion , El Chalten is definitely the best place for hiking in Patagonia and should not be skipped . <h> Tips for your trip to El Chalten : <p> Fly in " We would n't necessarily recommend the 27-hour bus ride we took from Bariloche to El Chalten on a mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus from there ( appr. 2.5 hours on newly paved roads ) is a much more comfortable option . <p> Book in advance " We traveled in the Argentine summer , and if you plan to visit El Chalten in high season ( Dec " Feb ) , make sure to reserve a hostel/hotel in advance . We learned it the hard way and ended up having to stay in an overpriced , mediocre hostel . <p> ATMs " Contrary to our outdated Lonely Planet , there are now two ATMs in El Chalten and you do n't need to arrive with stashes of cash . <p> Hiking " The El Chalten website has a good overview of all self-guided hikes in the area , plus details on the trails , ascents , difficulties and hiking times . The tourist office on the south side of the village has maps of the area , but all trails are signposted well . <p> Gear and food " I did n't have any special hiking gear and did n't need any for the trails I hiked . Wear layers as the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no food available outside of the village , so make sure to pack a picnic lunch and snacks before you set off , but water can be refilled in the glacial water of any of the streams along the way ! 129336 @qwx989336 <p> I think the Argentinian side is just much more accessible we still loved the scenery in Torres del Paine though ! I really appreciated that you could just walk out of the hostel and were on a trail ten minutes later amazing ! = <p> Dany , Thanks for your personal take on doing things alone . I 've done both in my time but mostly with another in recent years . Although traveling alone can be the ultimate in freedom , it can be lonely . Its always nice to be able to share experiences with a significant other . <p> Even when traveling alone , I 've always been able to find someone to share in the moment . There are pros and cons of both and I think a mix of both will be my plan for future tripping . <p> I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hike , why did n't  you just wait it out until she could ? Remember , slow travel is better . Did you have some schedule that was impossible to change ? You 're not vacationers ya know ! " Wherever you go , there you are ! " <p> Ha , Steve , we are no millionaires = Seriously , had we been in Asia wed happily waited for Jess to get better , but she was still 2- 3 weeks away from being able to going on a big hike ( on uneven terrain ) like this , and we just could n't afford to spend a lot of time in Patagonia , especially in high season . Prices for food and accommodation were outrageously high and we burned through money in the month we spent there . You know that we are all about slow travel normally , but Patagonia was just a little too expensive to just linger around = <p> Ah Ha , The rest of the story ! I was thinking a couple three days to recover , not a couple three weeks ! Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High season is a drag , especially in already high cost areas . I should know better than to second guess you guys . If you do n't  know how to travel , nobody does . <p> Talk about burning through money , hows New York treating you ? Out of the frying pan and into the fire ? Its a good thing you are house sitting ! <p> Brian , I can totally understand that ! It is an amazing place and I hope I 'll get to return one day ( and that the village wont change all that much ! ) The micro-brewery was certainly a nice surprise when we got there , and so were the many vegetarian options ! ! <p> Thanks so much , Megan yes , hiking with a dog is something I love , too . Well actually be able to do that in Arizona later this summer and I am already looking forward to it ! = I hope you 'll make it to Patagonia one day , it is soooo beautiful ! <p> Looks amazing ! I am also horrible at solo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for me I 'll always choose sharing the experience with another , preferably Dan ! Also , I always get lost , so inevitably I would end up stranded if I tried hiking along . Good for you for totally dominating El Chalten , though . It looks truly beautiful . <p> Thanks , Casey ! I am glad to hear I 'm not the only one who prefers to hike with their significant other I am still sad that Jess couldnt experience how beautiful the mountains around El Chalten were but at least the village itself was charming , too = <p> Dear Dany Great post , and amazing pictures " makes me want to go back to South America now ! A few years ago , I was in north Peru ( Huaraz region ) with my then girlfriend . We were there for about two months in total and did several treks , including a five-day one , wild camping and carrying our own gear . And yes , it was amazing to do it together , talk like we 'd never talked before and share the breathtaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other as we were walking through the stunning flower-kissed valleys on our way back down . But then I have to say that the absolute happiest moments of my life have all been while trekking alone . Two years ago , I did the Everest Base Camp Trek " alone , without a guide or porter . I was gone for nearly three weeks as while up near Base Camp , I knocked on the door of a scientific research station to say hello and got invited to stay and volunteer for a couple of days " I ended up staying ten and was part of the team that set up the world 's first ever live webcam on Everest this would not have happened if I were not alone ! I actually got really sick with altitude sickness and walking back down was one of the hardest things I 've ever done " it took four days and on the final day , I felt like I literally walked out from under the black cloud of grief that had been following me around since my father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and drastically altered my belief in myself . I now know I can achieve anything I put my mind to , and I also know that the experience would not have been profound in the same way if I were with someone else . So yes , I think there are pros and cons to both " but just to have the experience of being there , gazing out at some of the planet 's most awe-inspiring landscapes , looking down on the world and feeling like you can do anything at the same time as being reminded of how small you are that 's an incredible feeling and a true gift . And yes , I do look forward to sharing future treks with a loved one and soaking up those moments together " but I also know that any I do on my own will help me come closer to the meaning of it all . <p> Melody , thanks so much for sharing the story of your Everest Base Camp Trek absolutely amazing ! I agree that getting out of our couple bubble leads sometimes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have talked to us had they met us as a couple . And sometimes its not a bad idea to be all alone with my thoughts and reflect on how my life has changed over the last few years = I still hope well be able to hike Machu Picchu and some other treks in Peru together , I am already looking forward to it and I know that if I have to , I can do them by myself = <p> Great story Melody . My usual answer is " Ca n't I just have both ? . " You 're examples for a solo journey and a companion one are both inspiring . That 's really the trick actually , not necessarily doing it all but just doing it well . Doing it well each way possible = <p> Hi Dani , I do know what you mean about sharing an experience . Explaining to someone about how amazing something was is not the same as remembering a shared experience . On the other hand there is something very liberating about solo travel . I love both .

We watched an epic sunset from Berlins coolest rooftop bar , Klunkerkranich ( which even made it in the NYT , as a must-go spot in 36 hours in Berlin ) and strolled along the canals .

Nope , for the new $160 tourist visa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn sure we were going to spend more time in Chile to get the most out of that visa . <p> Our first stop to La Serena and the surrounding Elqui Valley made the entire visa worth it . <p> Chile 's second oldest city after Santiago , La Serena is just seven hours north of the capital by bus and the perfect size for exploration . With roughly 300,000 inhabitants , the city never feels congested or confusing . <p> The architecture here is gorgeous , and along with its wide pedestrian avenues that seemed to have been transported directly from Spain , La Serena is also known as the City of Churches there is one on almost every corner , it seems . <p> There also are good restaurants even a couple of vegetarian ones , plus quirky cafes with good coffee and you know how we usually feel about Chilean food ! The city has a breezy , refreshing character to it , owing to the fact that it is a popular beach town with the longest stretch of beautiful golden beaches in the entire country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could walk uninterrupted for an entire day along the coast . <p> This means that in January and February the beaches of La Serena are packed with tourists , but our stop there in November ( the start of spring in South America ) was fairly empty . Even in the height of tourist season , I 'd much prefer La Serena to Vi+a del Mar , Chile 's most popular beach resort that we ended up seriously disliking . Even though it is right next to Valparaiso , a stylish but gritty harbor town we loved Vi+a is a generic , soulless resort , whereas La Serena offers a much more laid-back , authentic beach escape . Sure , it takes five and a half hours longer to get there , but buses leave more than once an hour from Santiago and there are 4-5 flights daily into the La Florida airport from the capital , so it could n't be easier to get here , either . <p> La Serena is also the- jumping off point to explore the Elqui Valley , which made our list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chile . We only did a full day tour of the valley , but if we were to visit Chile again , we might even rent a car in La Serena and spend a few days to a week slowly exploring this 137 mile stretch of incredible , lush landscape surrounded by arid mountains and topped off by bright blue skies . The picturesque villages that dot the valley are separated by miles and miles of vineyards , wine grapes on one side and grapes to make the local Chilean Pisco on the other , plus avocados , alfalfa and other crops as well . <p> Our first stop was a papaya plantation , thought at first we did n't  realize they were papayas at all . The papayas are not like the huge ones we saw in Central America ; these are These are yellow , sour and tiny , almost like a starfruit . <p> From there we stopped at the hydroelectric dam on the Elqui river . This was a beautiful outlook over the valley , filled with cacti like in Arizona . <p> The tour continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chile 's Nobel Prize winning poet Gabriela Mistral , where we had time to explore the city center for a while . <p> The sun here is incredibly strong and we had lunch at a solar restaurant before heading to the Pisco Peralta distillery for a tour and pisco tasting just outside the appropriately-named town of Pisco Elqui . As soon as we pulled in along narrow , cobblestone streets , we knew we could easily have spent a night or two here . We know now that one advantage of spending the night in the Elqui Valley is that this region is home to some of the best conditions for star gazing in the world . Astronomers from around the globe sign up to a two-year waiting list to work for just one week at the area 's top-notch observatories , and there are also astronomy and observatory tours for curious novices as well . <p> Our stop in Pisco Elqui was super short , but even so you could feel the older , hippy dippy crystal vibe going on . During the 1960s , the hippie folk declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourism became a major focus fifty years ago . <p> It turns out that they were actually right on , man . <p> In 1982 , scientists measured the Earth 's magnetic forces for the first time and found that the most energetically charged place on Earth had indeed flipped from 30 degrees north in Tibet to 30 degrees south , right around Chile 's Elqui Valley . Was this energy what attracted us to La Serena ? No , probably not . <p> We 're not that in tune ' with things like that . It was more likely the sun , the sand and the fresh air of the small city vibe that we ended up loving so much here in this truly serene little town . <p> Practical information <p> We stayed at Hostal El Punto , a German-run hostel in walking distance to the main square and the bus station ( CLP17000 / $34 for a double room , CLP8000 / $16 for a dorm bed ) .

I had completely forgotten how amazing the summers in this fabulous city are ( no worries New York , you 're still my Number One and nothing beats all the things I love about summer in New York ) and since I have n't been to Berlin in warm weather in two whole years , I tried to soak up as much of the summer here as possible , taking advantage of the fact that pretty much everything happens outside during the summer months . And anyone who knows me knows that when I can be outside is when I am the happiest . <p> My days were spent writing in sidewalk cafes , sunset beers in the citys coolest rooftop bar ( Klunkerkranich , pictured above ) , karaoke in Mauerpark ( no I did not sing no way I 'd sing in front of that many people ! ) , strolls along the canal , running and walking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee shops ( there are just too many in this city .. but I guess that 's a good problem to have ) , neighborhood walks and showing a visitor around town . Plus : Meet-ups with new friends , catch-ups with old friends , and of course I also had to fit in all of the good food that makes Berlin so great : brunches and cake , Middle Eastern food , veggie kebabs , fresh fruit from the market and warm simits fresh out of the oven . <p> As usual , I wish I had more time here , but on Tuesday morning I will hop on a train to Amsterdam , the first stop on my Euro train adventure ( more on that in my monthly round-up ) !

Not only would I get to check out another Thai island , but I 'd also squeeze in a few more beach days before returning to loud and congested Bangkok . <p> I did n't  have any expectations for Koh Chang , and to be honest , did n't  know all too much about the island , so I was curious to see how Koh Chang compared to the islands in the Andaman Sea and the other islands I 'd visited in the Gulf ( Koh Tao and Koh Phangan ) .

I stayed in Lonely Beach in the south west of Koh Chang , a beach whose lonely days are long gone , but nonetheless I enjoyed the chilled vibe there as it was never crowded or busy . Apparently , Lonely Beach is the party central of the island . However , I did n't  notice any parties while I was there maybe my bungalow was too far away from it all .

Lonely Beach is a great place but it seems now people are liking even more Bai Lan further down as it has this vibe and feel Lonely Beach used to have a few years ago ( and still has in some way of course ) . Just more laid back and quiet and worth the trip . Hope you 'll make it back here soon , Cheers <p> Beautiful ! We went to Koh Chang back in 2011 and have similarly amazing sunset photos , particularly from the ferry going across to the island .

@@107143108 @2543108/ <h> A beerlicious weekend at Oktoberfest in Munich <p> A festival dedicated to beer ? That 's something I can get behind ! Even though I am not the biggest fan of Munich , when its Oktoberfest time , I cant get to Munich fast enough.Oktoberfest has always been my favorite German festival , and when I still lived in Germany I went to Munich almost every year to celebrate Bavarian beer culture.However , I 've only made it there a couple of times since I left Germany in 2006 , and my last visit was half a decade ago , which is why I was stoked to find out that my friend Rikka , who recently started her own round-the-world-trip ( and blogs about on Deviatingthenorm.com ) would be in Munich during Oktoberfest . We had made plans to meet up in Germany anyway , and I knew that there was no way that she could leave Munich without experiencing the worlds largest beer fest . So I altered my travel plans and would be flying straight into Munich from Israel for a couple of days of Oktoberfest fun.We even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional Oktoberfest-style " definitely a first for both of us ! ! Most of the non-Germans I meet assume that Oktoberfest is only an assembly of beer tents in which people consume beer after beer ( and admittedly , there are quite a few people for whom Oktoberfest is exactly that ) , but the festival is so much more than that . First and foremost , it is a big funfair with loads of amusement rides , haunted houses , and other establishments you typically find at country fairs.The most common misconception of Oktoberfest is that is held in October , but it actually takes place in September . It usually ends on the first weekend in October , but the big chunk of it takes places during last two weeks of September . The other common misconception is that Oktoberfest is just for tourists , and while it attracts tourists from all over the world , locals do go to Oktoberfest . Most of my Munich friends visit the Wiesn , as the locals call it , at least once and they all wear the appropriate attire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1810 when King Ludwig I married Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen on 12 October , and the citizens of Munich were invited to join the festivities surrounding the wedding . It was held in the same location it is in today : the Theresienwiese . The location of the festival is what gives it its nickname Wiesn ' . The next year , the celebrations were repeated , horse races were added , and after running the festival for a few years it was decided that this would be an annual event.Oktoberfest would have been celebrated for the 214th time this year , but it had to be cancelled several times due to war and cholera epidemics , which is why it was only the 181st festival.I am not sure when the beer tents were added to the festivities , but nowadays , there are fourteen massive tents on the grounds , each of which belongs to one of the famous Munich breweries . There are the super famous ones like Augustiner , Hofbr+u , Paulaner or L+wenbr+u , and some of the bigger tents hold 10,000 people ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve a table in one of them ) . Only beers from Munich-based breweries are served at the festival.So when I say tent , do n't take it too literal " they are more in fact proper constructions and their setup begins in early summer , around three months before Oktoberfest starts.6.5 million liters of beer ( or 13.736.947 pints ! ) are consumed in only 16 days . That might sound like a crazy number , but considering that 6.3 million people visit the beer festival and that beers are served in 1 liter steins , this number does n't seem too outrageous anymore . That 's just a little over one stein per person , and I definitely contributed to this number ( maybe even above-average , ahem ) . Another big part of the event is the food ! Half a million roast chickens are consumed every year , plus hundreds of thousands of grilled ham hocks , sausages ( especially the Bavarian white sausages called weisswurst ) steckerlfisch ( fish grilled on a stick ) , piglings and other meat dishes " Oktoberfest is a meat lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grilled oxen . 2013 was the first year that some tents offered entirely vegan options on their menu , and this year , every tent offered one vegan dish.For me as a vegetarian , Oktoberfest is where I get my K+sesp+tzle fix , and I am a sucker for the sweet treats : gingerbread hearts , sugar roasted almonds , chocolate covered fruits on sticks I try to stuff my belly with as many of them as possible.Another favorite of mine : L+ngos , a Hungarian fried dough specialty . Similar to a donut ( but not sweet ) , the dough is fried in hot oil and then topped with several toppings . Traditionally that means a spicy red chili and garlic sauce and cheese , but nowadays you also get L+ngos with an Italian twist , topped with tomato and mozzarella for example.The first day I spent at the festival this year was perfect to walk the grounds : sunshine , blue skies and warm weather . That 's not the norm for Oktoberfest " I have been several times when it was pouring down.After grabbing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to the Olympic Rings roller coaster that had caught Rikka 's attention . It took us an hour to cross the Theresienwiese to get from the entrance to that roller coaster , to give you an idea how big the festival grounds are . The actual size of the grounds is 42 hectare , that 's 420,000 square meters , or the size of 20 football fields.For some reason I thought it might be fun to go on that roller coaster , but once the car started moving I realized that it was not a good idea at all . Let 's just say that I 'd rather not share the photos of my face expression before the ride , and the pictures from after the ride even less so . I was terrified and my tummy turned and twisted with every loop . Luckily we had n't had any beer before the ride.From there , we headed to the old-fashioned Ferris Wheel which has been an Oktoberfest institution for decades and is the best way to get an overview of the entire fun fair and all fourteen tents.I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt much more comfortable just going round and round at a leisurely pace , instead of being turned upside down at an insane speed ! ) Looking down from the Ferris wheel , we also noticed that we were not the only ones who had the idea to take advantage of the brilliant weather and to enjoy Oktoberfest . The Theresienwiese was PACKED:On our second day at the festival , we did n't spend much time outside but went straight to the tent for which we had reservations . Having a reservation for a table is A HUGE DEAL . It is almost impossible for individuals to reserve a table , most reservations are made through companies , at least six months in advance.We were lucky enough to get two tickets from two girls who had dropped out of a reservation of my friend 's friend , otherwise we would n't have had the slightest chance to get into a tent on the closing day of Oktoberfest.Thanks to the reservation though , we got the full Wiesn experience : dancing on the benches , singing along to German schlager and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer at Oktoberfest is served in a Ma+ , which is a one liter stein ( 2.2 pints ) . You ca n't get a smaller beer than that . Adding to that the fact that Oktoberfest beer is stronger than normal beer with 6 " 7 % alcohol , you can imagine how crazy things get after a while.Especially foreign visitors are usually not used to beer that strong and steins that big and only realize how drunk they are when they get up from their bench.I have to admit that I had my fair share of drunken escapades at Oktoberfest as well , but let 's not get into those . Let 's just say that this year , I survived Oktoberfest without any incidents =Each tent has a live band that sings a mix of cover songs ranging from international classics like Tina Turner or Rod Steward to German pop singers like Helene Fischer.From time to time , you see this happen : <p> Somebody , usually a guy , climbing on top of a table , under the applause of his mates , and downing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the grounds , you 'll see drunk people sleeping on the sidewalks , and sometimes also in the middle of the street " my guess is that those are the same guys that drink the beer in one go ! That 's not the only crazy thing you 'll see : the higher the level of alcohol , the crazier people get . There are these guys with the slingshots for example , who offer to shoot chili powder up peoples noses for money , of course . What might seem a good idea initially , is regretted by most once its done.I had a blast without any chili or other dubious powders , and this was definitely not my last Oktoberfest " and now that I have a dirndl , I will have to make sure that it gets used a lot = <p> Rikka couldnt have chosen a more fitting gingerbread heart for me it says Rotzleffe , Bavarian for Snotty Brat = <h> My recommendations for visiting Oktoberfest : <p> If you 're planning to visit Oktoberfest , book your accommodation early " in May at the very latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go up like crazy . The earlier you book , the less you 'll pay ( and the more likely you are to get a room in the first place ) . Do n't expect to couchsurf during Oktoberfest . Almost nobody is willing to put up with drunk Oktoberfest visitors . The earlier you book your accommodation , the better . I usually use Booking.com to find the best rates for hostels and hotels . <p> Airfare to Munich goes up during Oktoberfest as well . Consider flying to nearby airports such as Salzburg , Frankfurt or Stuttgart . You can get to Munich from these airports in 2 to 3 hours on the train and if booked in advance , train tickets are 29 Euros . Buses take a bit longer , but can be booked for as little as 10 Euros ( sometimes even less ) . Check GoEuro.com to see the cheapest option for your trip this website compares trains , planes and buses within Europe and gives you the cheapest and fastest ways to get there.Even though Couchsurfing is not an option during the festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forums " there are always meet-ups at Oktoberfest , with people arriving in the morning to hold a table for Couchsurfers . That way , you know you 'll be enjoying a few beers with like-minded travelers . <p> When you get into one of the tents , just ask people if you can join their table . One of the best things about Oktoberfest is the people you get to meet ! Get to the festival grounds early " ideally 10am , if you are looking to get a seat in one of the tents . On weekdays you 're much more likely to get a seat than on weekends . <p> If you see a sign at the tent of your choice that looks like this:Do n't even bother waiting there . That means the tent is already closed due to overcrowding . I 've seen quite a few foreigners waiting in front of those overcrowded tents because they did n't  know what was going on , but as soon as this sign is hanging , the doors wo n't open again . <p> If you are looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about six months in advance . You 'll have to reserve for 10 people , even if your group is smaller . Each reservation includes two beer vouchers and two food vouchers , adding up to about 40 Euros per person , which means you 'll pay about 400 Euros for the table reservation ( but you 'll get the food and beer vouchers in return which is a good deal so the reservation itself is basically free ) . Find out more about how to reserve a table at Oktoberfest here.Check out several tents while you 're there . They all have a different decor , cater to a different clientele and have a different atmosphere . Some of my favorite tents are the Hacker Tent , the- Br+urosl and the Schottenhamel . You can find a full listing of all 14 tents with a short description of each one here.Expect to pay around 10 Euros for one Ma+ . That might seem a lot , but I paid US$16 for a Ma+ in a German beer hall in New York . In addition to the beer , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order a beer.There is no entrance fee to get on the grounds . Admission to the rides ranges from 6 to 9 Euros , and snack foods start at 3 Euros . A full meal in one of the tents will set you back at around 15 20 Euros . <p> Do n't try to get anywhere near the festival grounds with a car " take public transportation instead . My advice would be to find a Park &amp; Ride parking lot on the outskirts of Munich and take the S-Bahn train into the city . You can walk to Theresienwisese from Hauptbahnhof ( Central Station ) and Hackerbruecke S-Bahn station.LGBT Travelers : The second Sunday of Oktoberfest is Gay Sunday , celebrated in the Br+urosl Tent . Gaywelcome.com has the exact dates and detailed information . The second Monday of Oktoberfest is known as Prosecco Monday at the Fischer-Vroni Tent . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 12 Comments <p> This looks like it was so much fun .

I love the rides , the roast chicken , the gingerbread hearts and the beer . I will definitely be back again one day as the last time I went was 2008 = <p> Ah , the Canstatter Wasn in Stuttgart ! Been there once but it was just not the same . I usually was lucky to get a table every time I went to Oktoberfest , too , but this year they would n't let me in on the first day because I was carrying a bag with me : -/ Very annoying . Almost did n't  bring one the second day but then I could n't NOT bring my camera . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( until this year ) its definitely time for a visit , Katie !

You should come to Sydney ! = <p> Thank you for being in that area during Oktoberfest ! ! Made me go back there after so many years and reminding me how much fun it can be ! P.S. You look fantastic in that dirndl ! I hope you 'll get to wear it again .

They are the only low-cost airline that offers transatlantic flights at extreme bargain prices ( Los Angeles Copenhagen for $196 , anyone ? ! ) and I was happy to accept the invitation .

I am going to be spending 3-4 weeks in Sri Lanka plus maybe an additional week in the Maldives at the end of next year so looking forward to reading your posts about it . Have a look at 20 years hence , they have some great posts on Sri Lanka LONG ... <p> Oh , that 's awesome ! By then I should have some posts up about Sri Lanka ( and hopefully the Maldives ) . Thanks for letting me know about the posts on 20yearshence , I have to admit that I have n't done a whole lot of travel planning yet *blush* Will check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal LA to Copenhagen how could anyone pass that up . That sounds like an amazing upcoming trip ca n't wait to hear about the conference and yes , you must take advantage of the location to get to the Maldives . <p> Have fun in Sri Lanka ! I went with my partner to attend a wedding and it was beautiful we spent a night in Colombo , took the Viceroy Special to Galle and had a wonderful weekend there . No overt tourism ; amazing food and relaxed pace of life . You will have lots to look forward to : ) <p> I just got to Sri Lanka and its so good to be back in the tropics = Ca n't wait to get to Galle , heard great things . Apparently there is a beautiful train ride from Kandy to Galle . Still havent planned a lot for my stay here , guess its time to get on that = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143110 @2543110/ <h> Where to stay in Galle , Sri Lanka : Villa Templeberg <p> I was sitting on the comfortable bright orange sofa right underneath the three terrace windows that were looking out into the lush green tropical gardens . Two dogs were lazing on the front lawn , and the only noise I could hear came from some lizards that were sunbathing on the stones by the pool and some monkeys further away . No tuktuks , no people , only the sounds of nature . Villa Templeberg was exactly what I needed- the perfect place to get away from it all.Thirty minutes earlier , I had still been on the overcrowded train from Colombo to Galle , and now I felt like I was miles away from civilization . One of the villas staff had picked me up at the train and as we left the bustling train station area in Galle and headed out of town , I started to relax . I knew that the villa was sitting on a 5-acre coconut plantation , perched on top of a hill in the middle of the jungle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was craving after a few busy days in Sri Lankas capital , and I do n't think I could have chosen a better place to catch up on writing some articles and reflect on the TBCasia conference I had just attended.Villa Templeberg is a small B&amp;B , even though not right on the beach , just a quick 10-minute tuktuk ride from Unawatuna and from Galle , both located on the south eastern coast of Sri Lanka . The property has only six rooms , four of them in the main building and two set in a smaller building behind the villa . The small size gives Templeberg an exquisite feel , and it is possible to rent out the entire villa , which sleeps up to 11 people . I was staying in the Saffron Room , which used to be the dining room of the Dutch-colonial villa when it was still the estate of a working coconut plantation , as it used to be when it was built more than 200 years ago . Now , the spacious master suite comes with a king-size four-poster bed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , and a walk-in closet . Walking through the closet brings you to an even more spacious bathroom ( seriously , I have stayed in hotel rooms that were smaller than the bathroom of the Saffron ! ) , complete with a double sink and a big rainwater shower , all held in a simple yet stylish design.I had two nights at Templeberg , but I immediately wanted to extend my stay . Right outside the room there was a small porch with another sitting area , and the main entrance to the villa which led to the other rooms , the dining area , a lounge and a study , another veranda with chairs and a table , and the backyard around which the villa is set . All of this was surrounded by hundreds of coconut palm trees.The villa , which used to be the private estate of a German family until the late 2000s , was bought by Australian couple Brent and Chris and his mother Karen , and turned into a B&amp;B in 2012 . I loved that most of the antique Sri Lankan furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of time standing still here even though the villa has all modern amenities you could ask for , Templeberg has managed to keep the rustic character of the colonial estate alive that it used to be for so long.The next morning , I was in for another treat : the home-made breakfast . Local chef Trixie prepared a wonderful Sri Lankan breakfast with Sri Lankan egg hoppers ( one of the best breakfast dishes I 've had anywhere in the world ) , fresh tropical fruits and Sri Lankan tea , all of which filled me up for the entire day . <p> I spent my days at Templeberg mainly sitting on the terrace , writing up my conference notes , drafting articles , or chatting with Karen , the on-site host , and Lucy , the writer-in-residence who was spending a month in the Writers Bungalow in the back . Speaking of which : the Villa is the ideal place for a Writers Retreat , something I will keep in mind for the future considering renting the entire villa starts at only $300 per night , depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just by myself I 'd be happy to return for a longer period of time , using the tranquil setting to write undisturbed . With beaches and Galle so close , I would still be able to get my occasional beach day and the amenities of a city . <h> Stand out features <p> The swimming pool <p> Even though I have n't seen it yet " construction had only started during my stay at the Villa " I have to mention the swimming pool which is due to open soon . A 25 meter ( 82 feet ) long swimming pool right in these lush green gardens " could there be a more perfect place to lounge by the pool in the scorching heat of Sri Lanka ? I do n't think so , and I 'll have to visit Templeberg again the next time I 'm in Sri Lanka , just to see that pool , and maybe take a dip.The atmosphere at the villa <p> I simply loved the serene atmosphere at the villa which evoked the charm and romance of a bygone era and made it easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirlwind tour of Sri Lanka that I had just finished . I loved the tranquility and solitude , and that there was nothing to distract me from relaxing entirely and forget the world around me . <h> Room for improvement <p> The bathrooms <p> I checked out a couple of the other rooms during my stay and noticed that the bathrooms were not nearly as nice as the bathroom in the Saffron Room in which I was staying " I would love to see them upgraded as well ; but considering that the villa is improving constantly , I am sure that it is only a question of time until these bathrooms reach the same standard as the one in the Saffron Room . <p> The fabulous new bathroom of the Saffron room <p> More information on the area <p> I was only told about the nearby Kuduruduwa Temple and some other attractions the afternoon before I left , which meant I did n't  have time left to visit them . I wish I would 've been told about them earlier , or that a folder with information on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been placed in each room . I have always appreciated these folders in B&amp;Bs I stayed at , which usually contain information on good nearby restaurants and bars , attractions and other useful tips . <h> Overall <p> Villa Templeberg is the perfect base if you are looking for an intimate , quiet getaway but still want to close to fabulous restaurants , beaches and the UNESCO site of Galle Fort as well as the beach town of Unawatuna . No matter if you are a solo traveler in need of a peaceful oasis in Sri Lanka , a couple looking for some privacy or girlfriends who are ready for a few days of doing nothing other than lounging by the pool with a good book and a glass of wine , get massages and completely unwind , Templeberg will not disappoint . 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143112 @2543112/ <p> Welcome to our weekly series Hotel Tip of The Week . Being on the road every day of the year means we stay at countless hotels along the way . For all the dingy , disappointing budget digs , there are as many budget accommodation gems . We post one hotel tip of the week , every week , of places we feel confident recommending after having tried and tested them ourselves to show you how budget travel can be possible as well as enjoyable . <p> As one of Costa Rica 's top tourist destinations , Monteverde Cloud Forest has no shortage of accommodation , ranging from luxurious spa hotels to simple campsites . <p> High-end hotels are set deeper into the forest on the main road leading to the National Park while most of the budget accommodation is concentrated in the nearby town of Santa Elena , an easy 6km bus ride or enjoyable hike to the park . There are over 20 hotels to choose from in Santa Elena , and most fall within the same price range and offer similar amenities . When looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which offers all the things we usually look for in a hotel : free wi-fi , private rooms , and a lounge area where we can work . We were definitely not disappointed . <p> In fact , from the time we arrived into Santa Elena we were pleasantly surprised at every turn . Stepping off the bus after a nine-hour ride from the heat of Manuel Antonio to the chilly mountain town , we were greeted by the friendly hotel owner , who knew our names and led us down to the hotel . Once our packs were stored in our clean and cosy double room , we were shown around the hotel , given a map of the area and all of the hiking and tour options were clearly explained to us so that when we left shortly after for dinner , we felt we had a handle on everything to see and do in Monteverde . <p> Cabinas El Pueblo in fact doubles as a tour agency , and guests can book all tours and activities onsite : the Cloud Forest tours ( including guides ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens . Prices are the same as through the agencies in town and Cabinas El Pueblo promise a full refund in case of cancellations . This is something that other tour agencies do not promise , apparently , which is made perhaps a little too clear on the signage throughout the hotel ( see Room for Improvement below ) . <p> We immediately felt right home at the cabinas ' , which in Costa Rica usually means a guesthouse . Even basic accommodation in Costa Rica tends toward expensive , so the $20 double rooms seemed like quite a find . There are two clean shared bathrooms with hot showers on the bottom floor , which the five doubles share with a small three-bed dorm ( $10 per person ) . The spacious private double rooms upstairs not only have en-suite bathrooms but also come equipped with a fridge for $35 . <p> The living room has a TV and board games for guests , and the outdoor patio has hanging chair hammocks and a big table . The wi-fi works well both downstairs and upstairs , and those without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office for free . As most visitors to Monteverde spend much of the day and also evenings out on hikes , the hotel stays quiet during the day , and evenings are also quiet as tuckered out guests head to bed relatively early . This peaceful environment and mountain fresh air was perfect to get work done as well " for the workoholics/digital nomads out there . <p> Cabinas El Pueblo is a three-minute walk from the town center , and the supermarket is even closer , which makes it so easy to find everything you need to cook up a meal or make sandwiches here in the well-equipped kitchen ( see Stand Out Features below ) . <h> Stand Out Features <p> A clean &amp; spacious kitchen This kitchen is kept absolutely spotless and comes fully equipped with an electric kettle , coffee maker , toaster oven , toaster , two stoves and a fridge , which while pretty full , still fit all our items and was also clean . <p> Free coffee and tea all day Cabinas El Pueblo not only provides a coffee maker but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new pot anytime . Tea drinkers have an even better deal , thanks to the full selection of teas available , the best we have seen anywhere in Central America , with English breakfast tea , herbal tea , two different fruit teas and Earl Grey . Free milk for both is also provided . <p> Free Breakfast Although several of the signs throughout the place say that breakfast is only free if you book a tour with the hostel , breakfast was included every day . Guests sign up for one of two breakfast options written on a whiteboard the evening before . Breakfast varies daily and always includes fresh fruit and either tea or coffee . <p> Free sloth sightings There are a couple of sloth families living across the street from the hostel who are frequently seen moving along the electric wires that run alongside the street at night ( sad , but true , and these animals are fascinating ! ) . Sitting in the kitchen after spending a good part of a night hike spotting sloths , the owner excitedly ran in and ushered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the wires . <h> Room for improvement : Enough with the signs already <p> Until this point , everything at Cabinas El Pueblo seems to be set up to cater 100% to the needs of guests . However there was one point that needs massive improvement and is a serious pet peeve of ours . From the minute you walk into the hotel , you are bombarded by information as every available bit of wall space is plastered in signs . Not exactly the commanding military-like signs we 've seen elsewhere which constantly screech NO in clipped commands , at Cabinas El Pueblo signs are long , drawn-out affairs in very jumbled English explaining everything from what guests are allowed to do , what they are not allowed to do , more information about the town , more information about your breakfast ( commission made from booking with the hotel 's agency allows them to make breakfast free for everyone ) , and a few things we did not understand at all but think there may have been a fine involved for breaking the rule . <h> Overall <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who clearly aim to run a clean , well-maintained hostel and keep guests happy . The- tour agency on-site makes info readily available , and the super-clean kitchen , comfortable beds and ample relaxation space makes the hotel a great spot to recharge your batteries for a few days . <p> The Sloth Backpackers Hostel right next door is run by the same family and comes with similar amenities ( including sloth sightings ! ) should Cabinas El Pueblo be full . <h> 6 Comments <p> Cool Jaime ! There are a few others too that should fit right in your budget we mentioned Sloth next door , plus the Backpackers Monteverde , tho this one has mixed reviews on TripAdvisor so who knowsLet us know where you end up in the end ! <p> I really enjoy this hotel tip series , but I have a question : what criteria have to be fulfilled by a hotel/hostel for you to rate it as LGBT friendly ? Is it simply that they do n't  seem to notice/mention that you two are a couple and are sharing a bed ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnered man , and wonder whether me and my partner turning up to a place like this asking for a double room would raise any more eyebrows than two women doing the same . I have n't travelled in that part of the world before , but am planning to do so with my partner , so I 'm curious to know if you 've met any gay male couples whove had any more or fewer problems than you girls . <p> Hi Sam , thanks so much for your comment . We thought about your questions quite a bit . When we write LGBT-friendly , we have to admit that we are writing that from a Central American perspective , so our standards are pretty low . We say a place is friendly if they know we are together and do n't  raise a fuss about us asking to share the same bed . Central American budget hotels do n't  tend to market in any way to the pink dollar , so there is nothingextra there . Also , because of the way that Latin culture is , we feel that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two gay men would have . We would really love to hear about your experiences when you go to Latin America , or to hear from any gay male couples to hear about their experiences too . We are looking forward to seeing how it is in Asia and other parts of the world , too ! <p> Dani and Jess , A couple things , my brother has a male significant other and I can never seem to get them to jaunt around with me and my girl friend ; we enjoy spontanious travel as well . I would also like to know how Sams experience went ( but that was a 2011 conversation . Additionally , we we talking about coming to Costa Rica for a cheap get away . Lori does like the beach areas to stay , but does enjoy mountains , parks , horseback riding , etc . I have her convinced to come to costa rica in stead of Dominican Republic ( again ) . This time trying to get my brother and his partner to come as well of course . i would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help me with some lodging ideas there . Please email me , thanks ladies . And I love what you ladies are doing , I hope your still traveling and working , I 've traveled all my life and have been around the world ( literally ) , not as much now days but getting back to it . I do hope to hear from you . Thanks , Mark <p> Hi Mark , thanks so much for the kind words ! Definitely feel free to get in touch about lodging in Costa Rica or anything else we might be able to help with ! Excited to hear that you 'll be traveling there with your brother and his partner Costa Rica will not disappoint ! = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143113 @2543113/ <h> Perth : Why you should visit one of the most isolated cities in the world <p> We have not yet been to Australia , but this post by Australian-born guest writer Melissa Peters shines a light onto Perth that makes us want to head there immediately . Read on to find out why Melissa says we should visit Perth , one of her favorite cities Down Under . <p> Looking at a map of Australia , you can easily see why many people do not have Perth on their itinerary when visiting Oz . Located just under 4,000 km across the country from Sydney , and stuck way down in the southwestern part of the continent , Perth is famously known as one of the most isolated capital cities of over 1,000,000 people in the entire world . <p> Perth , capital of Western Australia <p> But 1,600,000 live there happily for plenty of reasons and those who make the trip there are rewarded with the experience of Australia 's finest beaches , coffee culture , kangaroos and coastal hiking treks . Read on for the top five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a trip to Australia : <p> 1 The journey to Perth <p> If you are traveling through Australia by train , the journey between Sydney and Perth is one of the most spectacular routes in the country . The trans-continental trip takes four days and three nights and is regularly named as one of the world 's greatest train journeys . Considering that fares start at AUD759 for this trip , you might consider buying an Australian Rail Pass for your visit , which allows you to take any train in the country , including the famous Ghan , for just AUD990 for a total of six months " the easiest and most comfortable way to see as much of Oz as possible . The 65-hour train journey from Sydney to Perth offers some of the country 's most stunning scenery , kangaroos , the Blue Mountains and the smallest town on the continent " Cook , with a population of four . <p> The Indian Pacific by Simon Yeo on Flickr.com <p> 2 The laid-back vibe of the city <p> Sprawling along the Indian Ocean and centered around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenic cities of Australia . With a population of 1.6 million people it is still the fourth largest city in the country , however , the vibe of Perth is much more laid-back than in Sydney and Melbourne . Perth is famous for its love of good coffee and is home to hundreds of coffee shops that celebrate the art of making excellent coffee creations . The city has a number of great markets and shopping areas such as Kings Street , London Court and Northbridge . Plus , thanks to its perfect climate it 's the ideal place to check out some of the many nearby beaches . <p> Perth by Adrian Nurman on Flickr.com <p> 3 The beaches <p> Perth has undoubtedly some of Australia 's most beautiful beaches , and thanks to its West Coast location , the sunsets here are always magnificent . Cottesloe Beach is the easiest to get to via public transport ( take the Fremantle Line to Cottlesloe Station ) , as is Scarborough Beach ( take the Clarkson Line to Glendalough Station and change to the 400 bus there ) . Swanbourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking to swim naked , being the Perth 's only nude beach . <p> Shoalwater Marine Park , just one hour south of Perth , is the best place for snorkeling , and in addition to shipwrecks and cavernous reefs , you 'll get to see dolphins , sea lions and penguins here . <p> Rottnest Island by Malcom Browne on Flickr.com <p> If you are looking for a truly unspoiled beach experience , head over to Rottnest Island , 18 kilometers off the coast of Perth and easily accessible by ferry . The tiny island ( 11 kilometers long , and 4.5 kilometers at its widest point ) has some of the most remote and untouched beaches of the continent with crystal clear turquoise water . The further you go from the ferry terminal , the more deserted the beaches " we recommend you hire a bike for the day ( a full loop around the island is 25km ) when you get off the ferry . If you want to spend the night here , make sure to book in advance , as accommodation on the island is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley Memorial Park you can see kangaroos in a more natural environment . It 's the perfect place to head to for a picnic in the company of some kangaroos . It 's the cheapest way to see them up , close and personal . <p> You could also head to Caversham Wildlife Park where you can cuddle koalas and feed kangaroos . The park is easily reachable from downtown Perth , admission is AUD24 . <p> Perth 's zoo has a designated Australian Bushwalk Tour where you can wander the paths inside their natural habitat . You can wander on visitors paths and get close to native Australian animals such as the dingoes , emus , koala , numbats , quokkas , red kangaroos , short-beaked echidnas , southern hairy-nosed wombats , Tasmanian Devils , and Western grey kangaroos . <p> 5 The natural attractions around Perth <p> Perth is surrounded by so many natural attractions that you can spend weeks here hiking , boarding down sand dunes , cycling , or exploring national parks . Some of the places that should n't be missed include the Lancelin sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you can race up and down giant sand dunes in 4WDs , sand boards or motorbikes ; and the Pinnacle Desert in Nambung National Park ( two hours north of Perth ) is one of the most otherworldly places on the planet : a desert filled with eerie limestone bricks sporadically scattered over vast yellow sand dunes . Both places can be combined in a day trip , if you have limited time . <p> Pinnacle Desert by Ian Sanderson on Flickr.com <p> The Bibbulmun Track is one of the most beautiful long distance walks in the world , spanning 1000 km from Perth to Albany . If you do n't want to walk the whole trek , you can opt for a day hike or an overnight hike . <p> If you are into cycling , you should n't miss the Munda Biddi Bike Trail which follows the coast for 332 kilometers from Mundaring ( north east of Perth ) to Collie in the south . <p> If you are planning to explore Perths foothills , you could also consider staying in Armadale , close to the parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time still offering enough bars , restaurants and shopping facilities . My top choice for a place to stay here would be the Heritage Country . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Way down . In the last 100 days we spent time in Mexico and Costa Rica only , and we reflected on it here . <p> But slow travel still has its adventures <h> Top travel moments <p> Living on a Caribbean beach for two monthsWhen we sat down to write our last 100-days-post , we had just started our 2-month housesit in a beach house on Mexico 's Caribbean coast . Our most challenging housesit to date came with the best rewards , including our own piece of Caribbean beach and a reef in the backyard . Living on the beach had been a dream , and we made the most of it . Waking up in the morning with the sunrise over the ocean , sneaking outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire solar system , snorkeling during our lunch break and working from a hammock every day shaded by palm trees <p> Returning to Mexico CityWe fell in love with Mexico City during our first visit in 2010 , so when a window of four days between housesits developed , we made sure to stopover in the Mexican capital . <p> Mexico City has so many different neighborhoods to explore , and this time around we hung around three entirely different areas of the city , plus spent time right down in the center on and around the Zocalo , eating delicious Mexican food and sweets ( at least I did ! ) . As Jess reflected yesterday , even though we love beaches , we are city girls after all . <p> A turtle arribada in Costa RicaThis is not only one of my favorite travel moments of the last 100 days . This is easily one of my all-time favorite moments . I love turtles , and I have never seen sea turtles in the wild except for one small one in the ocean when we snorkeled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' just a few miles from our beach in Costa Rica , I could n't believe my luck ! During an arribada , hundreds of thousands of sea turtles converge on a single beach to lay their eggs . This happens at only a few beaches around the world , and Ostional beach , not far from where we are housesitting , just so happens to be one of them . The best thing about this particular area is that it is off the beaten path and now it is rainy season , which makes tourism here incredibly low , especially for popular Costa Rica . When we got to the beach , we were practically alone with a few locals as they turtles emerged one by one , then two by two and then suddenly there were hundreds , and then thousands of turtles on the beach , digging holes , laying around 100 eggs and then disappearing back into the sea . <h> Most disappointing place(s) <p> San Jose , Costa RicaNo matter how often we 're in San Jose , we just do n't warm to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun sprinkled on top . Jess has more memories here since she studied abroad and lived in Costa Rica for a bit , but nostalgia is not enough to make us stay here longer than necessary . Even though we stayed at a lovely B&amp;B and found some fantastic street art , we were happy to leave and head to the beaches . <h> Worst travel moment(s) <p> Broken toes trump natural disastersIn the last 100 days we have escaped a hurricane and experienced a major 7.6 earthquake , but neither one of those make the list . The worst travel moment , mostly for Jess , was when she broke her toe . Walking barefoot along the beach in Mexico , she cracked and broke just her tiny little baby toe on a conch shell . The pain was more annoying than super painful , but it meant not being able to walk the dog , or walk the beach , wear snorkel fins , and not being able to get back into working out , something that she had wanted to do since finally recovering from the India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to a big obstacle for a life on the beach . <h> Top travel mishap(s) <p> Lesson learned : Take care of your dataWe almost made it 100 days without any travel mishaps until Jess ' external hard drive started beeping and clicking . Now the drive is damaged and data recovery costs hundreds of dollars we are not willing to spend . Everything of true importance is on the computer , but we will take backing up much more seriously and with a secure online service as well , not only an external drive . Ugh . Well , almost a mishap-free 100 days . <h> Travel recommendations <p> Stay in a B&amp;BAfter a run of hotel stays , we decided to hunt down some bed and breakfasts in Mexico City and San Jose this Fall . On a road trip through the Scottish Highlands a few years ago , the B&amp;B experience was just magical , and it turns out that the Bed &amp; Breakfast option is even better in a big city , providing such a personal experience every time . The owners are so welcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and make you feel like you have a home away from home . Bed &amp; Breakfasts provide quality and cleanliness of a nice hotel with the sense of community otherwise only a hostel provides , plus a big hot breakfast of local dishes to sample every morning . <h> Top food moments <p> Poblano Pepper Tacos in San Angel , Mexico CityForget restaurant reservations in Mexico City . Just walk around and sample the street food . This was our best method last time we were in town , and it certainly proved to work this time too . It will be a long time until we forget one particular taco standOn a stroll through the famous San Angel Saturday market we stumbled upon an upscale street food stall selling cheap but almost gourmet dishes , including chile relleno tacos . For those who do n't know , this is a poblano pepper , stuffed with oozing melted cheese and heavily breaded , placed inside a fresh , piping hot corn tortilla and topped with rice cream and hot sauce . Heaven ! <p> Home-made foodThe grass is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in an office somewhere , but when we travel there sure is one thing we always miss . Having a kitchen . <p> For the last 100 days we have been able to cook all our own meals except for the few days in Mexico City and San Jose . We have made creamy soups and Costa Rican Gallo Pinto , cakes , chocolate chip banana bread , home made pizza , vegetarian chili , cookies , Thai fried rice , and any other recipe we find on Pinterest ! This has been a welcome break from restaurant food , especially knowing that our foray into Argentine life has a foodie angle , so we 'll be sampling our way through the city 's restaurant scene the entire month of November ! 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 2 Comments <p> Oh wow 900 days already !

@@107143115 @2543115/ <p> After a day filled with waterfalls , geysers and Icelandic horses along Icelands Golden Circle , we started day two on the actual Ring Road . While we had breakfast , the owner of our lovely Icelandic farmstay came over with a map and showed us a small road just before Vik , a nearby town . It would be worth going in there to see some spectacular rock formations along the coast , she said , and because we were free to do whatever we wanted , we decided to take her up on her advice.And I am glad I did : - The rock formations and cliffs at Dyrholaey were stunning , and seeing the waves furiously hit the shore on this grey and stormy morning turned out to be a memorable start to the day . ( Tip : if you 're planning to drive this part of the ring road yourself and want to stop at Dyrholaey , turn left onto road 218 , just before you reach Vik . This is also a popular place to spot puffins , but we werent lucky enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing town which I did n't  find all that memorable ( its tiny ) , but it has a unique black sand beach which was definitely worth a stop . The sand is actually volcanic ashes , a reminder that Iceland is filled with volcanoes ( there are around 130 ) and yes , they tend to erupt every now and again.After that , it was a complete change of scenery : we found ourselves driving through green volcanic moss . In several areas of the island , you find lava fields , which over the years have been covered with a thick layer of green moss . This one , the Eldhraun lava field , is the largest one in Iceland , and was formed during a volcanic eruption in 1983-84 . It feels quite surreal to drive through this scenery , almost like a different planet , made up by moss-covered rocks , but it was also fascinating to see how lava can change a vast landscape like this in such a dramatic way.Soon after , the scenery was yet again completely different : we were passing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,300 km- , and made of volcanic sand . This area feels eerily empty . There are no settlements , no houses " just a giant dark mass of volcanic sand which seemed even gloomier on the grey and cloudy day that we were driving through it.It finally brought us to Skaftafell National Park , where we found ourselves suddenly surrounded by alpine mountains , even though , more often than not , we could only assume that there are mountains hiding behind the thick layer of clouds . Skaftafell is where the massive glacier- Skaftafellsj+kull was located , and it sat- to our left most of the journey- to J+kuls+rl+n glacier lagoon , which is undoubtedly one of Iceland 's most popular tourist destinations . I too- fell under its spell , and it ended up being my favorite stop on our road trip " but I wo n't go into too much detail now , because it deserves its own article . I will say seeing dozens of blue icebergs floating in a- lagoon is a sight that you wo n't forget anytime soon.Across the street from J+kuls+rl+n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach , but this one is filled with icebergs that have been washed ashore again after slowly floating out into the ocean from the glacier lagoon.I could n't believe that this was only the second day of our road trip " we pulled the car over again and again- to take pictures and enjoy the scenery . And this was just one of six days driving the Ring Road . Even though we spent a lot of time in the car during our trip , there was never a dull moment.Driving along fjords , crossing sand plains , passing waterfalls and glaciers " Iceland always keeps you entertained.One thing worth mentioning before sharing my favorite captures from Northern Iceland in Part III of our road trip ? Our accommodation in Eskifjor+ur , a small fishing town on the shores of the Rey+arfj+r+ur fjord , which is Eastern Iceland 's longest and widest fjord . <p> With our Icelandic Farmholidays self-driving tour , we 'd gotten an accommodation voucher for each night in our welcome pack , but we never knew beforehand what to expect . We let the knowledgeable customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to find us a well-balanced- mix of B&amp;B 's , hotels and farm stays so that we could get a taste of all the different styles of accommodation available in Iceland.Our stay in Eskifjor+ur was both Rease 's and my favorite : a little cottage only a few meters from the water , with a fully equipped kitchen in which we could cook dinner and make breakfast . And there was a heated Jacuzzi outside , which was the perfect place to unwind after a long day of driving.To make things perfect , the sun decided to set in spectacular colors- that night " we were tempted to put the rest of our road trip on hold and spend a few days here , writing while watching out over the fjord , hoping to spot whales.But onwards it was . The next morning , we would pass through the Almannaskar+ tunnel and emerge in Northern Iceland , where we 'd spend some time exploring the out-of-this-world beautiful Myvatn peninsula to be continued <h> Tips for driving in Iceland <p> Do n't expect proper highways- <p> The only four-lane highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the other streets were two-lane country roads , often narrowing into one lane , especially on bridges . That 's why it is important to always stick to the speed limit and be attentive " nothing worse than meeting a car in the middle of a bridge because you were n't paying attention about oncoming traffic.Pick up the free Around Iceland brochure by heimur . You can get it at any tourist information centre and in most hotels , and it has maps where gas stations and toilets are marked , plus a whole bunch of other useful information . <p> Install- the Iceland Roads App <p> The Iceland Road Guide app has comprehensive information about all of Icelands roads , food &amp; drink along the way , sights , and general information . You can download it here for Android and for iOS . <p> A GPS might not be enough <p> Sometimes I preferred a map or GoogleMaps on my phone over the GPS that came with the car . For me , it was easier with those to get an overview over the entire days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal preference . If you prefer actual paper to an app , I recommend this detailed Iceland Road Guide ( which includes the app for free anyway ! ) . Gas stations are limited- <p> Make sure you always have enough gas especially when you 're about to drive through a rural area . This is why I recommend picking up one of the maps that have gas stations listed that 's how you 'll know when to expect the next opportunity to fill up.Make sure to rent with a reputable company <p> The first thing the friendly Europcar employee gave me was a Europcar brochure in which all Europcar branches in the country were marked , including their phone numbers , in case of an emergency . Considering that the road conditions in Iceland are n't always the best , especially when leaving the main roads , it was a relief to know where I could go should I puncture a tire or something like that.4WD vs regular- car <p> I had asked for a small car , simply because I 'm used to diving smaller cars and knew roads would be narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , not a 4WD . Was this sufficient ? Absolutely . Even though our drive included some unpaved roads ( sometimes I was driving on rocky lava gravel ) , the VW we were driving was absolutely sufficient.Manual vs automatic <p> Make sure to ask for an automatic if you 're not comfortable driving stick . <p> Weather forecast- <p> Do n't expect the weather to stay the same throughout the day itll change all the time ! We often found ourselves leaving in rain and enjoying bright sunshine a couple of hours later . Instead of waiting for the rain to stop , just drive . 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Awesome !

That combined with a string of bad news since the beginning of the month has put me in a slump which I 'm trying to get out of . <p> Coming to Mexico was certainly a good decision and is helping me getting my mojo back : As soon as I walked out of the terminal building last week and saw the familiar OXXO convenience store across the street , I felt like I was coming home .

I 'd never been to Mexico 's second largest city , and it was time to fix that . The city reminds me a lot of Mexico City , which I love , has plenty of awesome street art , beautiful colonial buildings and tree-lined plazas that invite to linger . There is a fantastic art scene here , and I 've been trying to take as much of it in as possible . The highlight was the Art Museum of the University with a giant , stunning Orozco wall mural and mural covering the interior of the auditorium dome .

For a 2014 update on the latest edition to my travel gear , check out my Travel Gear , 2014 Edition post ! <h> Ever wonder what a globetrotting girl brings with her to travel the world non-stop ? <h> Travel Technology <p> Traveling and working from the road since 2010 , we have gone through quite a few laptop changes ! Because we work while on the road , our computers are most important . When we started , I went to Best Buy and bought us two little ASUS Eee PC netbooks for $250 each . These netbooks made terrific travel companions and we used them until they burnt out . We never expected to be running a website full time and putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They lasted 14 months of massive overuse , though respect ! <p> My Acer Aspire TimelineX laptop , which weighs in under 4pounds ( 2kg ) was a steal in the ultra lightweight laptop category at under $600 ! Eventually my Acer slowed down and then completely froze , and now I am in love with my Acer Aspire S3 , a very similar model but sleeker , faster and lighter by a pound ! <p> LSTN headphones <p> I have finally made the change from in-ear to on-ear headphones and couldnt be happier with my new LSTN headphones ! Not only do they look good with their wooden housing ( you can choose between cherry , ebony and beech ) , but they also have an amazing sound quality . Plus : the company puts a big emphasis on social responsibility and gives back hearing to a person mainly in developing countries for every pair of headphones sold . I find my LSTN headphones to be perfect for traveling since they are light-weight yet robust and they are noise-cancelling which helps tremendously on bus rides in countries where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moments like those make you want to pick up good headphones before you leave on a long-term trip and at $99 , these headphones come at a decent price . You can buy them on Amazon.com . <p> One of my more most recent purchases , I could never travel again without my Kindle Free 3G + Wi-Fi . I bought it just before the Kindle Fire came out , , so its officially already the old school Kindle but I 've now got hundreds of books all in one slim device . Any form of Kindle is perfect for long-term travelers , short-term travelers or even for lazy Sundays in bed . <p> We picked up our Belkin Rockstar Multi Headphone Splitter in a hi-tech vending machine in L.A for $15. , completely on a whim . It has turned out to be one of our best purchases ! With this little guy we can listen to music , podcasts , play games and watch movies on long bus rides without sharing a pair of headphones .

We use the Universal Travel Adapter Plug Kit and havent had any issues with it . <p> Smartphone charger : These days , wed be absolutely lost without our iPod Touches especially during long bus rides . Sadly , the battery life is n't all that great anymore but since Portable Chargers started popping up , my live has been changed ! ! !

This is basically an improved version of a packing cube , with three separate compartments for your socks , panties and bras ( or other accessories , like belts or ties ) . With the separate compartments , you 'll be able to find what you need right away . The TUO has snap buttons which form a practical handle and allow you to hang it , which makes it super easy to access your clothes . Another plus : it comes with a small laundry bag . Check out my full review here , or head straight to the Origami Unicorn website . <p> Toiletries take up a lot of space , especially hair products .

Every time I 'm on night buses , I am freaked out about where to stash my valuables without having to be paranoid the whole time that somebodys going to steal them , and this underwear is the perfect solution .

The BottleKeeper basically keeps your beers nice and cold in the heat , lined with neoprene and padded on the inside . From the outside , it looks like an unsuspicious water bottle , should you ever find yourself in a place where alcohol might not be , ahem , legally consumed .

I had heard mixed reviews about Bogot+ " most travelers seemed to spend only a couple of days here before heading to more pleasant places , and stories of muggings and robberies made me feel a little uneasy at first . However , I was lucky enough to meet up with a travel buddy who 'd spent quite some time in Bogot+ and who knew the city well " including some great salsa bars and unassuming yet delicious vegetarian eateries . <p> I lost my preconceptions- about Bogot+ quickly , and after nearly a week here , I have to say that I do n't dislike the city at all , contrary to what I 'd expected . A free walking tour through Bogota 's Spanish-colonial center , La Calendaria , including tidbits about life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lots of interesting stories made it easier for me to understand the city , and a game of Tejo , during which you throw a metal puck at little paper triangles filled with gun powder , trying to cause a noisy explosion , plus a Chicha tasting ( an indigenous fermented corn drink ) were added bonuses of this tour . It- me realize- that this city was nowhere near as bad as some people had made it out to be . <p> Another thing Bogot+ has going for it ? Its thriving street art scene ! As a huge fan of street art , I was blown away by the amount of murals all around town , and the talent of the local artists . And after my first taste of street art in Cartagena , I was excited to take another street art tour " this one much , much better than the one in Cartagena ( which I 'd also really enjoyed , just to show you how good this one was ! ) and I could n't put my camera down , that 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-hour tour ( which was also free , by the way ) . <p> While I preferred staying in the historic center , I made sure to base myself in another neighborhood as well to venture outside of La Candelaria .

@@107143120 @2543120/ <h> How to spend the perfect fall weekend in London <p> One of my favorite things about having spent the past few months- in Europe ? How easy it was to hop on a train or plane for a city break in another country ! I could- be in Prague , Barcelona , Copenhagen or Rome within a few short hours , soak up some sun in Lisbon for a couple of days , indulge in Italian gelato in Rome or stroll along the canals in Amsterdam . <p> But after traveling around Europe for nearly three months , I came to the conclusion that London was still my favorite European city . I might be biased , having lived there for so many years , but I 've also traveled to enough other places to be able to say that I do n't  think any other European city can rival London in all the things it has to offer , in terms of culture , food , nightlife , markets , shopping , green spaces , things to do , theater , and areas for urban exploration.When I stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a first-time visitor around town something I did on a regular basis when I was living in London , which is why I felt comfortable playing tour guide for my friend and which is why I thought it was time to share my recommendations for the perfect fall weekend in London with you . Of course this itinerary also works at any other time of year . Here is my suggested itinerary for three days in London including the must-see London landmarks , afternoon tea , my favorite museums for some culture but also some cool street art spots , the best walks and my favorite green spaces , delicious- food and evening activities . <h> Day 1 : Royal London and Londons most iconic sights <p> I usually start my London explorations with a walk from Victoria Station all the way to St Pauls Cathedral , or if- Im- not too tired yet , a little further into the City of London to take in the views from the Monument and to finish with a pint in Leadenhall Market . <p> From Victoria Station , follow the signs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can visit the palace during the summer months ( tickets start at -20.50 ) . But for most people it is enough to glimpse through the fence and snap some pictures of the guards in their fancy uniforms . The Changing of the guards , which takes place- at 11.30am ( daily between April and July , every other day the rest of the year ) - is a great spectacle to catch , and its free , so you might want to time your visit so that you can see it.From Buckingham Palace , walk over to Green Park and follow the lake until you reach the Horse Guards building , where- you 'll encounter another typical London sight : the Horse Guards , as the name implies . From there , walk down Whitehall , past Downing Street , and you 'll reach Big Ben and the Houses Of Parliaments , across from Westminster Abbey . Cross Westminster- Bridge and turn left onto the South Bank , where you 'll follow The Queens Walk along the river . <p> here 's where you can stop for a ride on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge , a pleasant walk that 's just over a mile long . Before crossing the bridge , make sure to check out the current exhibitions at the Tate Modern , Londons most famous contemporary art museum , which is housed in a former power station. - It is one of my favorite contemporary art museums in the world . Heading up to the cafe is a good idea no matter if you 're a fan of modern art or not , because the views from up there are fantastic . <p> Once youve crossed Millennium Bridge you can decide if you want to pay St Pauls Cathedral a full visit ( tickets from -18.00 ) or just peek inside ( well worth a peek , I say , even if you do n't  want to pay for full access ) . If you 're not visiting the church , head further east until you reach the Monument , a freestanding- 202- ft ( 62 m ) - tall- column that offers probably the cheapest views over London at -4 . The catch ? You have to climb 311 steps to get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for your effort you get a neat certificate that confirms that you successfully climbed to the top.And now you definitely deserve a pint and a short ten minute walk from the Monument , you find Leadenhall Market , a beautiful covered market dating back to the 14th century ( and representing Diagon Alley in the first Harry Potter movie ! ) . Unless you 're heading there on a weekend , you 're also likely to encounter dozens of suits there people who work in Londons finance sector . Most banks have their offices in this part of the city , and bankers , like most other people , tend to enjoy an after work pint ( or two ) . Mingling with them makes for an interesting experience though . There are also some restaurants in Leadenhall Market- if you 're looking for a typical British pub dinner , head to the Lamb Tavern . <h> Day 2 : Notting Hill and Central London <p> I 'd start Day 2 with breakfast in Notting Hill Walk up Portobello Road and pop in to some of Notting Hills antique shops along the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victorian architecture . If you happen to be in London over the weekend , I 'd recommend heading here on Saturday when the famous Portobello Road Antiques Market takes place but come early , it gets pretty crowded around noon.Two- of my favorite breakfast places right on Portobello Road are- the Electric Diner and Lowry &amp; Baker- ( also great to just pick up a coffee ) . - Two more breakfast spots worth mentioning in the area are Granger &amp; Co ( by Australian celebrity chef Bill Granger but reasonably priced ) and the cozy Wildflower Cafe . For an extended Notting Hill walk , I recommend turning right onto Westbourne Grove. - Head back south on Garway Road- until you reach Kensington Gardens , and go for a stroll in this beautiful park which is basically an extension of Hyde Park . If you are into art , I recommend stopping at the small Serpentine- Gallery right in the park which has always interesting exhibitions ( free admission ) . Walk eastwards through the park until you hit Marble Arch , the giant arch on the northeastern corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and now its time for afternoon tea ! During my last visit to London I tried something different : Street Food Afternoon Tea at- The Arch , a small boutique hotel in- the fancy Marylebone neighborhood ( just a short walk from Oxford Street ) , - which has an interesting twist to it : instead of your usual mini sandwiches and scones , they serve- mini burgers , mozzarella risotto balls , vegetable skewers and- quesadillas , followed by scrumptious eclairs , macaroons , rice pudding and fruit tarts all combined with tea , of course , which you can select from an exquisite tea menu . I tried the vegetarian version of the street food tea , but of course there is also one for carnivores . If you 're heading to London before Christmas , you 're in luck : the Arch currently has a special Christmas-inspired street food afternoon tea ( check out the menu here ) . I loved the elegant yet cozy ambiance at the restaurant , and it is just the right thing to do before hitting Oxford Street for a little shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and busiest ) street , you might want to get away from the hustle and bustle here . Turn right ( southwards ) onto- Argyll- Street ( just after Oxford Circus ) which leads to the pedestrianized Carnaby Street . Here you 'll find more independent shops , different from the big High Street chain stores , and plenty of options for a quick bite or drink . <p> Follow Carnaby Street all the way down to the end and you 'll find yourself right in the heart of Soho , which really comes to life after dark. - If you 're a theater buff like I am , I suggest ending the day with a West End show . **25;378;TOOLONG is a good place to start looking which plays have good deals , and you can find a comprehensive guide to finding cheap Westend theater tickets here . <p> If you 're not into musicals or plays , end the day with a drink or dinner in Soho . Places I recommend are : Franco Manca for pizza , Oka for sushi , Bao ( to-die-for Taiwanese street food ) , Fernandez &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , Busaba Eathai ( Thai ) , and Yalla Yalla for Lebanese food , to give you just a few ideas . For drinks , check out the French House ( great beer selection ) , the Lyric Tavern for a solid British pub experience , Marks Bar ( underneath the Hix restaurant ) for sophisticated cocktails , the Experimental Cocktail Club if you 're looking for a speakeasy experience ( good luck finding it ) . If you want to fancy it up , head to Milk &amp; Honey ( reservations obligatory ) . <h> Day three : Markets and street art <p> Day 3 is all about East and North London . If you 're visiting over a weekend , I 'd plan to do this day on a Sunday . Start with a stroll through Columbia Street Flower Market ( only on- Sundays ) , or begin right in Brick Lane , where a massive flea market takes place every Sunday . Take your time and take in the street art around here , the flea market stalls , head into the Old Truman Brewery which is now filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of Brick Lane you 'll find plenty of Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants which is what the area is famous for . Make sure to be hungry enough for a curry here you 'll get the best curry in London . You may be overwhelmed by the large number of restaurants I recommend consulting Tripadvisor or Foursquare before you decide which one to go to , or check out this rating of every curry restaurant on Brick Lane.After lunch , head over to Pettycoat Lane- Market if you 're into fashion you can find some amazing bargain deals here ( note : also only on Sundays ) . <p> If you love street art , I suggest- checking out some of East Londons cool graffiti scene ( you will have seen some in Brick Lane already ) , but its a bit tricky to find all of the colorful pieces , which is why I recommend taking a free- London street art walking tour ( tipping mandatory ! ) with a local guide who will also give you some insights on the artists and East London in general . The tour runs five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you cant make the tour , here 's an excellent self-guided street art walk through East London which includes brilliant pieces by famous street artists such as Banksy , Roa and Stiks.Since this day is all about markets , you ca n't miss Camdens famous markets , which can be an all-day activity its easy to get lost in the giant maze- of different markets , all set around the locks of Regents Canal . Since I moved to London for the first time in 2005 , the markets have become a major tourist attraction and some of them have also seen a revamp . And yes , it is crowded , but its still one of my favorite things to do in London , and the food stalls alone are worth the trip to Camden . If you 've still got stamina after all the market strolls , head south along Regents Canal until you reach Primrose Hill . Its a lovely walk and the views over London from the top of Primrose Hill are unbeatable ( on a sunny day , that is ! ) . <h> Tips for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pick up an Oyster Card , Londons transportation card . It is much cheaper to travel on public transportation with an Oyster Card with it , a day ticket will cost you -6.50 . If you simply buy a day ticket without Oyster card , its a staggering -12.10 ( US$18.30 ) ! <p> If you are planning to visit a lot of the attractions that are n't  free , such as the Tower Of London , the London Eye and Buckingham Palace , consider buying a London Pass which is -75 for two days and 89 for three days . here 's a good article that explains when its worth buying a London Pass and when its better to skip it. There are two local buses that pass most of Londons major sights and landmarks , such as Tower Bridge , Hyde Park , Tafalgar Square and Oxford Street . If you 're pressed for time , get an Oyster Card with a day ticket at -4.50 ( buses only ) much cheaper than the hop-on hop-off buses that cover pretty much the same route . You can find a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If its raining , head to the museums . The great thing about London is that most of its fabulous museums are free ! My favorites include the National Portrait Gallery , the British Museum , the National History Museum , Victoria &amp; Albert Museum , but have a look at this list for more free London museums . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 6 Comments <p> Last time I visited London ( two years ago ) , the one day metro ticket was only 8 pounds , I am surprised to learn that now its almost 12 pounds . Maybe next time I am going to use an Oyster card . <p> I 've walked around in the center of London instead of going with the train , and that was lovely . <p> But the center of my journey there was the Natural History Museum , weve just passed through there and we 've spent like four hours there admiring all the things . The vault was also amazing , with some splendid minerals . <p> I was shocked when I found out that a day ticket is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! But I agree with you , Linda , Central London is definitely walkable . The Natural History Museum is one of my favorites in London such a magnificent building ! <p> Brick Lane is a lovely area for shopping and wandering , but its the last place I 'd recommend a visitor to London for curry . It very much caters for the tourist trade and the quality is much lower than some other areas have a look at Tripadvisor , and you 'll see none of the Brick Lane curry houses come anywhere near being the best rated in London . <p> Probably the best in that area is Cafe Spice Namaste in Whitechapel ( which is about five minutes walk from Brick Lane ) . Or I 'd suggest trying one of the other areas with big south Asian populations like Southall in West London or Tooting in South London . They are off the tourist trail and mostly cater for Londoners and local residents Indians &amp; Paksitanis , and the food is generally of a better quality . <p> @Geoff I havent gone far away from the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant near Picaddily Square on a good price ( like 6 pounds all you can eat ) . Maybe in other area of London I can found better cafes and food . <p> I am very much interested in a place to have my morning tea , somewhere where I can combine some types of tea and of course , have some internet access for my work . Can you recommend something like that in South London ? <p> Geoff I did have some great curry in Brick Lane though it can be hit or miss , which is why I recommended consulting Yelp / Foursquare / Tripadvisor instead of just walking into a place = I would n't travel to Brick Lane specifically for a curry , but when in the area I agree with you about Southall though amazing for authentic Indian food ! But barely anyone makes the trip out there . I still remember when I went there and everything was in Indian , all the stores , even a cinema with only Bollywood movies , Indian bakeries .. and the food ! !

@@107143122 @2543122/ <h> Five Destinations You Should Visit In 2017 <p> With 2017 just around the corner it is ( finally ! ) time to make travel plans for the coming year ! People ask me all the time which places I recommend for an unforgettable trip , and yes , I have plenty of favorite spots all over the globe . <p> To give you more specific recommendations for your dream vacation I put together a list of my favorite places in the following categories : adventure , beach , city , romantic getaway and cultural escape . <p> If you need travel inspiration for 2017 , here are my five top recommendations in each category : <h> Beach getaway : Mexico <p> Mexico has been a favorite of mine for years , and revisiting the country two times this year only reaffirmed my love affair with the Mexican culture , the people , the food , and yes : the beaches . I still prefer the Caribbean side with its tranquil shallow turquoise water and powdery white beaches but now that I 've visited the major vacation spots ( Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see the draw of those as well . For a relaxing beach vacation , my top two choices would be Akumal and Tulum , both on the Riviera Maya . <h> City break : New York <p> If you ask me , there is simply no better city break than New York flights from Europe are cheap and short , and the city has so many things to offer to make for an action-packed weekend : Broadway shows , museums , the art mile in Chelsea , an unrivaled food scene , dozens of neighborhood to explore and enough iconic sights to keep you busy for days . My number one tip for anyone visiting New York is to go beyond Manhattan : check out some of Brooklyns awesome neighborhoods , such as Park Slope , Williamsburg or Brooklyn Heights , and if you already know Central Park , put Brooklyns Prospect Park on the agenda for your next visit to the Big Apple . <h> Romantic Escape : Tirol , Austria <p> I couldve picked the usual suspects , like Paris or Venice , but I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in your head immediately when thinking about a romantic getaway . What I love about Austrias Tirol region is that its great for a getaway year-round and that there are plenty of spas and spa hotels here offering relaxing couples packages including massages and other treatments , but also saunas , steam rooms and pools . The restaurant scene here is amazing , and you can walk off all of the carbs you 'll inevitably consume on one of the many mountain hikes . You can rent a cottage and they 're super affordable , or treat yourself to a romantic stay at a lodge on top of a mountain . In the winter , you can snuggle up by the fireplace while its snowing outside , go snowshoeing and warm up with glasses of mulled wine when you get back . <h> Adventure getaway : Iceland <p> I never expected to love Iceland as much as I did , but the little island in the Atlantic Ocean simply blew me away . Not only does it have one of the most remarkable sceneries I 've ever seen with its many volcanoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , geysers and otherworldly landscapes , but it also offers a number of activities for adventure-seeking travelers : volcano climbs , multi-day cross-country treks , glacier treks , whale watching and northern lights excursions , quad off-roading tours to name just a few ! Even in a short week you can pack in plenty of adventures here . <h> Cultural vacation : Sri Lanka <p> Sri Lanka is actually much more than a cultural getaway , but having eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites in a very condensed space means cultural travelers can pack all of those in a 2-week trip around the country . You 'll get to see the ancient cities of Polonnaruwa and Sigiriya which sits in spectacular mountaintop location , the sacred city of Anuradhapura , the Golden Temple of Dambulla and the remarkable Temple Of The Tooth in Kandy . Then there 's the old town of Galle and its forts , and nature lovers will appreciate the Central Highlands with its stunning tea plantations and the Sinharaja forest reserve . <p> In addition to world heritage sites , Sri Lanka is also great for wildlife spotting ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephants ) and beaches Marissa or Unawatuna in the south are perfect spots to wind down after a whirlwind tour around the country . <h> 4 Comments <p> Hey , I totally agree with this list ! After reading this I think I 've made up my mind . Does Sri Lanka really have 8 Unensco sites ? That is a lot . Sri Lanka was very high on my list already and now I think that will be my next trip . Iceland will definitely be next ! = <p> YES , so happy that you 'll check out Guadalajara and PV ! And New York ! ! You might freeze to death , coming from Mexico , but NYC is still THE BEST = Sri Lanka is probably the destination that I 've recommended the most in the past few months !

@@107143123 @2543123/ <h> She said , She said : The Detour to Iguazu Falls <p> The world-famous Iguazu Falls are often named as the most spectacular waterfalls in the world and listed as the New 7 Wonders of Nature in 2011 . When we were planning for the South America leg of the trip , we never thought Iguazu would be something we would skip . Yet when we were just one step away in Rosario , Argentina suddenly we questioned whether we wanted to make the trip . After months of never-ending bus rides , should we really take a 24-hour bus ride up to the Falls for just two or three days , only to take another 20 hour bus ride from there to Salta , our next stop ? <p> After wavering back and forth , we got it together and put this into perspective : this is a once-in-a-lifetime situation and we will never be closer than this . We booked our bus tickets and set off to find out what this trip was all about but we went into the experience with two different perspectives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Iguazu Falls was worth it <h> Jess said : <p> I was committed to the long detour up to Iguazu Falls , but was feeling completely burnt out when we got there . Thankfully , or not , the first two days in town were gray and rainy so we pushed back the trip to the falls until the third day . Unfortunately , both the town of Puerto Iguazu and our hotel left much to be desired and I was doubting the decision to come to the Falls.In Patagonia , we could have drunk the water straight from certain rivers it was so clean , and Buenos Aires felt practically European . But Puerto Iguazu felt run down , - our overpriced budget hotel bed gave us itchy legs and the only good wi-fi was at Freddo and Bonafide , Argentinas biggest and most impersonal ice cream and coffee chains . The town felt like a tourist trap , and my- alarm bells go off at the mention of a tourist trap , so I was already on edge . <p> It made sense to compare the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two different countries : Niagara Falls runs along the border of the U.S. and Canada , and Iguazu Falls actually runs between Brazil and Argentina . <p> Finally , on day three the sun finally came out and we hopped on the tourist bus and were shuttled to the Argentine side of the Falls . Here we lined up to buy tickets , passed through the turnstiles at a massive entrance and my alarm bells went off again when we herded onto a silly tourist train that left from Grand Central Station ' and chugged along through the forest to the first part of the park . I held back making sarcastic or negative comments Danis eyes were wide with excitement and I did n't  want to take anything away from her . But I was feeling very much tourist trapped <p> Act 1 : - We hiked through the forest , dodging tourists , talking , laughing together until we reached the first viewing platform . <p> Here every bit of doubt and sarcasm was zapped out of my system . <p> The first views were incredible , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even 20 Niagara Falls lined up in a row . I was consumed by the 375,000 gallons of water rushing over the falls edge per second and I wondered how many seconds would it take for the water in one of Patagonias massive glaciers to rush right by my eyes here ? Ten seconds ? White , blue , brown and beige water rushes past your eyes in every pattern , from rapids to waterfalls crisscrossing over and through each other , grape-sized droplets exploding off as mist and spray . <p> I even found the walkways incredible : - wood and steel paths hang directly over water , and you stand just meters from the moment when the water rushes over the edge . If you were to fall over , you 'd be no more significant than a drop of water yourself . I have never felt so small .. until the next part of the day . <p> Act 2 : We took a speedboat out onto the Iguazu River alongside the falls . I expected to cozy up near the falls like we did at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ! Everything we had with us went in massive dry bags and the speedboat literally took us under one of the falls . I had absolutely no control , my eyes tried to stay open to experience this completely , but I lost the battle and completely stopped blinking and kept my eyes shut after a few seconds . This was a thrill like no other and gave me a respect for the Iguazu Falls that I simply can not articulate . <p> Can you spot the tiny boat below the Falls ? <p> We dried off and made our way on the train , which I suddenly did n't  mind , and made our way to the only other stop " The Devil 's Throat . <p> Act three , Devil 's Throat , was probably the most amazing experience of the day in terms of sheer wonder. - In this one little corner of the Iguazu Falls , over 50% of the water plunges from the Iguazu River above into the Parana River below . The mist bounces back up higher than skyscrapers and so thick you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get enough of staring down into this incredible abyss . <p> The next day , Dani went to see the falls from the Brazilian side , but American passport holders have to pay $130 for a visa just to cross over for the day ( the same as for a three month tourist visa ) or risk sneaking over on local buses and not paying , but I do n't  take those kind of risks , so I did n't  go to Brazil . <h> Dani said : <p> After two days of rain in Puerto Iguazu , the weather on the third day was perfect , and I was so relieved. - I felt sorry for the people on their tours who only had one shot at seeing the falls , and had to go in the rain what an entirely different experience . <p> I knew I 'd be taking hundreds of photos and had read that sunny days meant rainbows and butterflies " how could we not wait for that ! <p> We had to walk to a little jungle train station , take a little train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish ) and followed the upper trail . I heard the water before I saw it , but when I finally got that first glimpse of the Iguazu Falls , I immediately understood why people had said to us that Niagara Falls seems tiny in comparison . <p> Apparently , Eleanor Roosevelt sighed , Oh , poor Niagara ' when she first saw Iguazu . Even though that first glimpse reveals on a fraction of the over 270 falls , I was blown away by the size and power of what was within my view . <p> There were two trails , upper and lower . First I took Jess up to get an overview from the platforms and then went down to the lower trail which I had read was where you really felt the power of the falls . We got soaked just from the mist , and I 'll never forget how loud the crashing water was and how close I could actually get to the various waterfalls . <p> From there we got in line for the speedboat ( we bought tickets along with our bus tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-speed under one of the waterfalls , pure adrenaline rushed through my veins as the water landed on me with full force . For a second I thought we would all drown . Within a minute , I was soaked to the core . <p> From there we made our way to Devil 's Throat ( Garganta del Diablo ) , which is over 700 meters wide and 82 meters high . This is the biggest waterfall in Iguazu , and even though we had already been at the falls for hours by the time we jumped onto the train to the viewing platforms , this was such a highlight to the day . First , we walked one full kilometer on walkways over rivers and through jungles that there would be no other feasible way of traversing . I watched a crocodile chill out next to a catfish the size of a dolphin for over 20 minutes , in awe of the fact that they were not 50 feet from the edge of the Devil 's Throat and yet would never be able to fathom what a giant drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to the U-shaped Devils ' Throat , I was overwhelmed by the power of the water , which somehow seemed ten times more powerful than the other falls we had seen that day . Knowing that the water was rushing over the edge , non-stop , day and night in perpetuity made me feel dizzy . <p> The next day , I went to Brazil by myself . We fly sometimes ( rarely ! ) without each other , but are always together when we go through land borders , so it felt strange to worry about visa stamps , hearing Portuguese and dealing with a new currency all while Jess was back at the hostel . <p> On the Brazilian side there is no train , just a bus to the first viewing platforms . Only one 1.5km walkway follows along the cliff , unlike the many trails weaving up and around the Argentine side but it offers exactly what the Argentina Falls ca n't offer : a panoramic view of almost all of Iguazu Falls . <p> The most spectacular feature on this side of the falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Devil 's Throat . Like Jess said , in Argentina its like looking down into an abyss , but in Brazil a walkway brings you over the river along this massive wall of water that crashes down right next to you ( and obviously soaks you ) . Its a magnificent sight . The walkway ends at the viewing platform directly over the second half of the terraced falls . Standing on this terrace I saw the upper half of the waterfalls above me , and the lower half crashing into the river below me , water around me on three sides , thanks to the U shape of the Devil 's Throat . This is what I felt made the Brazilian side really special and definitely worth the visit . <p> As much as I 'll remember the waterfalls , on both sides I 'll also never forget the thousands of colorful butterflies fluttering past and even landing on us , ever so gently and often . The jungle here felt like some sort of paradise right out of a storybook . <p> Sowas it worth it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iguazu Falls is worth every penny and minute of time to get there. - It is hard to comprehend the power of these waterfalls , but once you are right underneath them , you get the full gasp of how they are able to provide enough energy for all of Paraguay and 20 per cent of Brazil . <p> There are other , equally famous falls in the world , like Africa 's Victoria Falls which are larger but do n't have the walkways that give you the kind of access that you have at Iguazu , and then you have Niagara Falls , which are simply cute ' in comparison . <p> Details : How to visit Iguazu Falls <p> Unless you take a helicopter from the Brazil side , it is impossible to see the entire 1.7 mile stretch of cliffs where the Iguazu River crashes 60-80m down into the Parana River below . <p> Plan in at least three days in town so you go on a day with good weather . It makes all the difference . <p> Stay either in Foz do Igua+u ( Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty minutes from the Falls . <p> Local buses go from either side every twenty minutes . <p> There are also nicer , air-conditioned buses at a higher price . If you visit the Brazilian side from Argentina , fork out the $2 extra for the tourist bus that way you do n't  have to change at the border . <p> Bring your own picnic lunch . The food on both sides is mediocre and overpriced . <p> Bring a dry-bag for your valuables " you will get soaked on some of the platforms . ( Large , heavy-duty dry bags are available from the speed boat company if you go out under the falls which you really should ! ) <p> What does it cost to go to Iguazu Falls ? <p> Bus from Buenos Aires to Puerto Iguazu : There are several companies that offer the 20-hour bus ride from Buenos Aires to Iguazu on a daily basis ; prices range from ARS650 ARS850 ( US$117 US$153 ) . You can find a full list of bus companies and prices here . <p> Bus from Puerto Iguazu to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side <p> Most companies offer return tickets " we used Rio Uruguay on the Argentine side , and Cruces del Norte runs from Puerto Iguazu to the Brazilian Falls ) <p> Local bus from Argentina to the Brazilian Falls : ARS8 ( $1.60 ) to the border , ARS12 ( US$2.40 ) from the border to the Falls <p> Admission to the Argentine side : ARS170 ( US$34 ) <p> Boat tour ( Argentina side ) : ARS150 ( US$30 ) <p> Admission to the Brazilian side : BRZ41.66 ( US$21 ) <p> If you 're American , either get the $130 tourist visa or do n't  go . Fellow travelers Megan and Adam from **25;405;TOOLONG got sent back at the border , others get fined . - If you 're going to Brazil anyway , then its not a problem . 129336 @qwx989336 <p> I loooooved the Iguacu Falls . It is one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen in my life . Never been to to see the Niagra Falls , but I just love the fact that the Iguacu falls are surrounded by jungle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Definitely one of the most spectacular things we 've seen in our lives Argentina had another one of those : Perito Moreno Glacier couldnt be more different from Iguazu , what an incredibly diverse country ! The rest of South America will have a hard time impressing us in the same way = <p> We are at the final countdown of going to Argentina . The falls look amazing . And definitely better than Niagra Falls ! We are looking to spend a couple of days in BsAs before heading out to Iguazu Falls . Any tips on hotels in either place ? Many thanks . <p> Hi ! I just read this post . I see you came from Rosario . I 'm planning on doing a similar route . How did you get from Rosario to Puerto Iguazu ? Did you take a direct bus ? or did you have to stop and transfer somewhere ? If you did have to transfer buses , where did that happen ? Do you remember what bus company you took ? Thanks ! Johanna <p> Hi Johanna We actually took a direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  remember which company we took I think there were only a couple of companies at the bus station that offered the direct connection to Iguazu and we chose the cheapest one = Enjoy the Falls ! <p> Hi i 'm a tourism guide in Brazil and i have one small observation to make . When you said " how they are able to provide enough energy for all of Paraguay and 20 per cent of Brazil " this is not the Iguassu River . This is the " Parana River " which is maaany times bigger then the Iguassu , and the Itaipu dam stays only 13 KM from " Foz do Iguacu " city . Once there , choose the " Special Visit " that will take you to visit the core of the dam . <p> Glad you made it to the Brazilian side the old expression is that Argentina owns the falls , but Brazil owns the view . Kinda like Niagara . There 's lots to see on both sides though , and I definitely remember that awesome feeling as well when you reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazilian side , there 's a nice Bird Sanctuary across the street from the entrance , as well as helicopter tours . Also , Foz do Igua+u sounds like a better place to stay than Puerto Iguacu , from what Ive read , though still not a perfect tourist destination . There 's also a large dam to visit on the Paraguay border with Brazil , if you like that stuff ( we did ) . <p> One last thing not mentioned about wildlife is the Coati very agressive but also fascinating and entertaining . <p> Good article , thanks . Made me re-live it . And yes , I agree it is definitely worth the side-trip and expense . We had no regrets . <p> I totally agree with the Niagara Falls comparison , Daniel = Great tip about staying in Foz do Iguacu but since only one of us was able to enter Brazil for free , this was n't an option for us . I did mention the coatis in this article , by the way = Six things nobody tells you about Iguazu Falls <p> A very informative post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . I visited Igua+u in August 2011 , and these were my experiences then note that things might have changed in the intervening years . <p> If you are already in Brazil ( visa required ) Argentina does not charge a visa fee to enter the country for one day to see the Argentinean side of the falls . ( If you enter Argentina elsewhere , you will probably need visas for both countries . ) <p> I recommend you take a nylon or a cheap plastic rain poncho ( or maybe 2 since the cheap ones are very flimsy ) with you . You can buy them on eBay for a few dollars . They sell them at the falls , for much more . You can feel the overspray from far away , so when you get close you will get very wet . If you have the cheap ones , you can give them away when you leave . But if you are continuing your travels , it might rain elsewhere , so you might keep one in your backpack ( lighter &amp; less trouble than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags to put your things in , and place those inside a nylon backpack . I kept my camera under my rain poncho , and had paper towels in a pocket to wipe it dry after taking a few photos . <p> I visited the Brazilian side first , then took a bus to Argentina the next day . At the border , you must exchange money for pesos . The people there will give you an estimate of the cost of the bus to the entrance , the entry fee to the falls , boat trips , etc. and then you can add some for food and souvenirs . <p> From the entrance to the falls in Brazil , its a walk of about 2 minutes to a beautiful bird park . You can enter some of the cages to take photos without the cage between you and the birds . The bus back from the falls entrance stops at the bird park to take you back to the city . <p> I had some leftover pesos which I thought I could exchange for Brazilian cash on the return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did n't  leave the bus or go into the customs office . However , my hotel in Foz do Igua+u took my leftover pesos and put the rest of my bill on my American Express card . I think most places in town take Argentinean or Brazilian cash and most credit cards . <p> If you can take only one card to Brazil , I suggest VISA . I take several . That way I can get the best cash back deal if they t or airline miles if they take my preferred cards . ( I never saw any place that took Discover . ) Make sure your cards have no foreign exchange fees . <p> I stayed at the Hotel Del Rey in Foz do Igua+u . Nice , moderately priced , but not fancy . Rooms a bit small , but adequate and include a refrigerator . The breakfast buffet ( included ) was great and for about $8 ( US ) they served a fabulous dinner , too . There is a pool on the roof , too . It was across the street from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falls and only 2 blocks from the bus to Argentina . It was close to a supermarket and the zoo . In 2011 , the internet charge was high . Now the hotel and most others in Brazil offer free wifi . <p> Although I used to live in Brazil and spoke Portuguese well , I had forgotten a lot . The hotel staff spoke English , Portuguese and Spanish . I will be returning in 2016 or 17 &amp; have found several vacation rentals that look promising , so that is an option , too . I wont have a car , so I need a place near public transportation , so I might return to the hotel since it was so convenient . <p> I found the small city there lovely , with wide , tree-lined streets . Very little traffic even at morning rush hour . It was a nice change of pace from Salvador and Rio . I 'm a senior citizen , not at all interested in night life , but you can probably find some if you look for it . <p> I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard that the tour of the power plant is interesting . There are several different tours at various prices , so next time , I plan to stay 2 extra days . If it rains for a day or two , I can tour the plant and take a rest-day . Our trip will be for about month and for a long trip , I need a day here and there to slow down . <p> Unlike Europe , most Brazilians do n't  speak English but they do in most tourist hotels or attractions . However , i would recommend when traveling anywhere , you learn to say , at the least , things like " thank you , " " please " , " do you speak English ? " " the bill , please " " where is the restroom " and other similar phrases in the local language . You can learn most on the internet . I download an English-Portuguese ( or other language if I 'm traveling elsewhere ) dictionary and translator that does n't  require wifi connection to my iPad mini so if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a word or phrase . <p> On TV in Brazil , you will find some U.S. reruns ( for example Law &amp; Order was on quite often in 2011 . ) They are in English with Portuguese subtitles . So , you will have something to entertain you in your room . But it wo n't hurt to take a tablet you can connect to wifi or a good book . Recent English books are hard to find in Brazil , so if you finish one , give it to an English speaker who lives there or donate it to your hotel for other guests . <p> And do n't  forget to take a set of foreign plugs to fit almost any outlet so you can charge camera batteries and your other electronic devices . <p> Another important thing to remember is that Brazil moves at a slower pace than the U.S. and not all the conveniences of home are available everywhere . But the Brazilians are warm and welcoming , so that should make up for any inconveniences . Slow down , relax , be patient , and enjoy your visit . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143125 @2543125/ <h> Life lately and upcoming travels : April 2015 Edition <p> This month involved time in Thailand , Hong Kong and Germany , a painful encounter with a sea urchin , a near-disaster with my upcoming travels ( thanks to last months passport debacle ) but luck was on my side and I- am now en route to California ! And today I reached a massive milestone : My Five Year Travelversary ! <h> Happy anniversary to me ! <p> Five years , HALF A DECADE ! I still ca n't believe it Ive been traveling the world longer than I 've managed to do anything else in my adult life . I was contemplating writing an anniversary post but I felt like I said most of the things that Ive come to realize over the past five years and what travel has taught me in my job-quit-versary post back in February ( you can read it here : Looking Back : Five Years Ago I Quit My Job To Travel The World ) . <p> Coming up : The 5 best and 5 worst moments in 5 years of travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animals <p> I have compiled my best and worst moments of the past five years of travel , and how travel has changed me ( coming up in May ) . I am still amazed that I 've been traveling for such a long time , ( 60 months ! ) , and that I still do n't  feel the urge to settle down again or that I 'm tired of traveling , and I am curious to find out where this journey will lead me . The past twelve months have been a crazy roller coaster , with many emotional ups and downs , but also with some of the most amazing trips Ive taken so far ( Israel , the Philippines and Sri Lanka , to name just a few ) , and the most lucrative business opportunities . Year 6 is also shaping up to be a fantastic year , and I am looking forward to the next twelve months . <p> On to month 60 April 2015 . Where I 've been , what went well and what did n't  , and a quick outlook on what 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ao Nang , a destination I still have mixed feeling about . to be honest , I was underwhelmed by the entire Krabi coastline , which , despite being pretty , just did n't  do much for me . I did , however , spend two days on Koh Poda island while I was there , which made my entire time in the Krabi area worthwhile . My final return to Bangkok after that was fabulous , and from there I finally flew back to Hong Kong , something I 'd been looking forward to for months , and which was easily my favorite destination this month . I knew I 'd have a stressful time during my quick visit to Germany afterwards , and so I made sure to truly- relish- my time in Hong Kong , where I had a week to explore the city at a slow pace . As soon as I arrived in Germany , I started rushing around , dealing with bureaucracy , catching up with my nearest and dearest and lots of babysitting for my nephew and nieces , one of which I surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Asia trip came to an end , but I 'm already in the process of planning my next trip because I still havent been to Myanmar and Vietnam and both countries have been high on my travel wish list for years . I was n't ready to leave Asia AT ALL , and to get my jacket out which had been sitting on the bottom of my backpack for the past few months , but luckily I only had a few days in the chillier spring temperatures in Germany ( and it was unseasonably warm I even wore a dress and flip flops several times ) and I knew I 'd be leaving for hot weather again shortly more on that below in What 's next for me . <p> Goodbye Asia <h> What went well <p> Becoming friendly with Bangkok Once again , I had a fantastic time in Bangkok . The city and I have come along way from absolute dislike and the grudge I was holding against it after getting scammed in 2011 , to now actually looking forward to my Bangkok stints . I will be back soon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I gave the city a second chance . <p> Finding a dream beach Another thing that went well was finding the dream beach I 'd been looking for in Thailand , but did n't  find anywhere . ( Do n't  get me wrong : I found countless pretty beaches , but when I say dream beach , I picture this:Koh Poda , a tiny island , small enough to be circled by foot in less than an hour , finally ticked all the boxes . Ill be writing more about it soon . <p> I got a new passport ! This is the most important thing that went well this month , since I had booked a non-refundable flight to L.A. , and another flight to Arizona , both of which I would have lost the money for had I not gotten my passport in time . My passport saga had caused me a nerve-wrecking six weeks since it was damaged last month , and I only got it with one day to spare before I left town . To say that was a close call is an understatement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hong Kong in January , my second visit was nothing short of wonderful . I could n't have asked for a better time in Hong Kong and I think it worked its way up on my list of favorite cities in Asia , claiming the number one spot . I will write more about my visit shortly , but highlights include the PoHo neighborhood , a hike to the Peak , runs with scenic views and finding a fabulous speakeasy bar . <h> What went wrong <p> My friend stepped on a sea urchin I was traveling with a friend at the beginning of the month and she stepped on a sea urchin when we were frolicking in the ocean together on Koh Poda . ( Yes , even a dream beach can have downsides ) . If you do a google image search for sea urchin sting you can see what an awful experience this is . Luckily we had hired a private boat that day which brought us back to the mainland straight away where we could deal with the injury and get rid of the spines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like these are some that we had seen while snorkeling earlier that day:A slight concussion I ran into a concrete wall at full speed . That 's all I want to say about it . It was painful and I learned this week that a concussion is no fun . <p> The squat toilet incident I almost broke my foot in a roadside toilet and because this month is all about injuries , I feel like I should mentioned this incident which couldve ended much worse than it did : in Thailand , I slipped off a- squat toilet and almost broke my ankle . Luckily it was just bruised . <h> Lessons learned <p> Travel insurance ! All of the above incidents were a good reminder of the importance of travel insurance and that I had to renew mine before heading to the States . <p> How NOT to treat your passport Ive already mentioned it last month but I am stressing- it again : treat your passport with the utmost care . Also , since I just read that a fellow travel blogger couldnt get on his flight because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , I feel that I should point out that its not only important to take good care of it but also to double check if its still valid before a big trip . <h> Giveaway ! <p> Ill have a giveaway in my upcoming anniversary newsletter which goes out on Sunday ( 3 May ) : you can win a 2-night stay at the Radisson Blu Royal in Helsinki , the hotel I stayed at during my visit to Finland and which I loved . If you are n't  subscribed to my bi-monthly newsletter yet , you can sign up- here . You can read more about the Radisson Blu Royal in my detailed review here . <h> Best posts of the month <h> What 's next for me <p> Three months in the US ! As I 've mentioned briefly , I am en route to California where I 'll be spending a week in the LA / Venice Beach / Santa Monica area , exactly five years after my first visit . Ill be hanging out with friends , have a whole bunch- of cultural things planned ( LACMA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some street art in the Melrose District ( thanks to- Trover- for the tip ! ) , go for runs by the ocean , finally check out LAs lesbian scene and give into a guilty pleasure- ( do n't  judge ! ) . From there , I 'll head to Arizona where I 'll be spending a month with one of my favorite dogs I 'll be housesitting in Tucson for the fourth time . Anyone who 's been reading this site for a while knows how much I love the Sonoran Desert , and I am stoked to return and to revisit my favorite places in Southern Arizona . <p> I have to admit that while I 've got July completely mapped out , my plans for June are still pretty much up in the air I love the excitement of the unknown , that I do n't  quite know yet where I 'll be , but I have a feeling it will involve some time in New York City = <h> 13 Comments <p> Wow , five years of travel ? That is an impressive accomplishment ! Jeez , it sounds like you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to step on a sea urchin . here 's to a new , injury-free month ! Have fun in California ! That 's my home state . Do me a huge favor and eat lots of Mexican food = <p> It does n't  seem like five years ! Even my last trip to LA seems like it was just yesterday and not five years ago ! Where in California are you from ? I held off on Mexican food even though I was tempted sometimes , but I know that its just not great in Asia = CANT WAIT TO STUFF MYSELF WITH SOME TACOS ! = <p> Lucy it was a random coincidence that I 'm spending time in LA exactly five years after my first visit ! And as for Taylor , I do n't  know what happened , because I used to hate ( and bash ! ) her , and now the part of my LA trip that I 'm most looking forward to is her exhibit , haha how did that happen ? ! = <p> Thank you = I went to the Grand Canyon in 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still on my bucket list .

Two weeks that 's awesome ! Ive been keeping an eye out for housesits there because I 'd love to spend more time there to explore the nearby beaches and islands and go on some of the hikes people have been raving about ( the Dragons Back hike is supposed to be fantastic ) . <p> That Koh Poda beach looks amazing ! After spending the last month on Roatan , I 'm so into being a beach bum . I 'm glad you posted a photo of a squat toilet . I 've never seen one .

Instead of merging our opinions into one , we started a new series recently , She Said , She Said , where we both tell our side of the story about events and experiences while we travel . In this article in the series , we are sharing our views on an afternoon exploring the historic Lastarria neighborhood of Santiago with FotoRuta , a unique street photography tour . Jess shares her views on the tour from a non-photographers perspective , while Dani tells how she felt about it as an avid photographer and dSLR user . <h> She Said : Jessica 's perspective of FotoRuta Santiago <p> When we first found out that FotoRuta photography tours had expanded to Santiago , I thought it was something for Dani to do while we were in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought , why not . I do n't  even have a real camera , just my iPod Touch , but it turns out that was all I needed . I definitely recommend the tour to people who , like me , think they stink at photography , and here 's why . <p> Threes a crowd <p> First of all , FotoRuta is not a traditional tour , as there is not even really a guide . Part photography course , part afternoon stroll , we started by gathering in a cozy basement of a cafe in the Lastarria area of Santiago with Cat , our tour leader , who spent about an hour teaching us about different photography methods and techniques , which was hugely valuable for those of us with no real photography experience . We were then given a list of clues to find and photograph in the neighborhood for an hour and a half . <p> Hand in Hand <p> The neighborhood is easily one of Santiagos most charming quarters , so it was really fun sort of strolling about looking for creative ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mirror Mirror or Level Headed . <p> It was fun to be creative with Dani in the context of the tour , because although we spend so much time wandering city streets together around the world , we stopped and smelled the roses in a different way than we normally do . In the end , Dani captured most of the images , but I took the time to employ the techniques we learned at the start , which has since really inspired me to improve and put more thought into how I compose my own photos . I can already sense a massive improvement and not only- because my thumb and index fingers- no longer feature in every other picture . <p> Eye To Eye <p> Afterwards we returned to the cafe for a glass of wine and time to go over everyones photos . Our group was not particularly skilled in photography , but the mood was friendly and there were definitely a few gems to be seen . I personally found that this part dragged a bit , but overall I thought the tour was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a way to see their own city in a different light . I know there are some people out there who prefer to only take in the main sights on sightseeing tours , but I imagine that any savvy traveler out there would enjoy this as more than a photography course or an enjoyable afternoon , but as a way to creatively focus their lens on real , genuine , authentic Santiago moments . What is travel all about if not that ! <p> Simply ridiculous <h> She Said : Dani 's perspective of FotoRuta Santiago <p> Just before we left Buenos Aires , I came across a photo tour online that was described as a photography scavenger hunt across the city and was crushed that we had run out of time for it . Until , that is , I discovered that FotoRuta had just started to run tours in Santiago our next stop . Jess wanted me to do it by myself , being the photographer , but I suggested she should come along and see if she could learn some techniques that would encourage her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we booked ourselves on the next available tour and I was excited to talk photography and uncover Santiago from a different angle . I had taken two photography classes a few years ago and was hoping to pick up a few new tricks on camera handling and shooting techniques . The first hour was allocated to technical tips with our guide Cat , but this was more of a refresher than anything new , and it was good to be reminded of some rules and tricks . The group was a mix of photography buffs with dSLR cameras , those with digital cameras , iPhonographers and- the new species of iPad photographers . <p> Artistic license <p> Just before the introductory hour ended , Cat handed us our clues and a map of the area that we were about to explore . The clues , ten in total , were left to us to interpret and to transform into photos , and included things like hand in hand ( one of the easier ones ) , simply ridiculous and Its a mystery . We were ready to team up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples stuck together , Jess and I headed out together as well . <p> FotoRuta is not like an ordinary tour with a guide who leads you around instead you are given one and a half hours to meander through the neighborhood and find objects or scenes that you can photograph for one of the clues . This meant that we did n't  necessarily learn much in terms of factual information about the history of the Lastarria barrio , instead on the hunt for unusual things or interesting occurrences as we wandered the streets . <p> Mirror Mirror <p> I have to admit that it was much more difficult to find a photo for each clue than I had expected . Some of them were fairly easy , but others left us with a big question mark on our faces . In the end , we pulled together a photo for all ten clues and the 90 minutes flew by ! All of us gathered again in the little cafe where we had started and Cat asked us to submit one photo per team per clue . Over a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken and listened to the explanations of why the person had taken it ( if it was not obvious ) . I really enjoyed seeing how the other people had interpreted the clues and what objects they had found to photograph . All in all , it was a fantastic way to spend an afternoon of photography and exploration in one of Santiagos most beautiful neighborhoods . <p> We both agree that FotoRuta is a great tour for anyone with even just a mild interest in photography and looking for a different kind of tour , exploring more off-the-beaten-path areas of a city instead of the major sights . 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 10 Comments <p> Foto Ruta seems like a great way to share your love of photography while exploring a new neighbourhood .

I ca n't blame them , the city is popular for a reason : beautiful architecture , world-class museums , the well-known Bavarian beer culture , and the proximity to some of Germany 's most spectacular scenery : the mountains of the Alps , stunning lakes such as Lake Starnberg , Chiemsee or Lake Wolfgang . <p> Lake Starnberg <p> While the traditional must-see spots in Munich , such as Viktualien Market , the New Town Hall , St Peter 's Church , English Garden , Hofbr+uhaus , the Cathedral Church of our Lady and Nymphenburg Castle , to name just a few , should n't be missed on a trip to Bavaria 's capital , there are a few quirkier and lesser known spots that are well a visit and show you a different side of Munich , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are planning a trip to Munich and are still looking for a place to stay , Booking.com- for example has a comprehensive listing of hotels at very competitive prices . <p> Here are my suggestions for some more unusual places to check out while you 're in Munich " all personally chosen by me : <h> The Potato Museum <p> Potatoes are one of Germany 's main stables , so it only makes sense to honor the ubiquitous potato with an entire museum . Quite different from an ordinary museum , teaches you everything you ever needed to know about this delicious crop .

The best thing about this museum ?

The crazy waves make a certain spot of the little river an attractive river surfing spot , and you 'll see quite a few daredevils surfing in an extremely narrow stream filled with rocks " a heartstopping experience ! Munich actually attracts surfers from all around the globe with the Eisbach , including world-famous competition winners ! People surf here year round , but the best time to visit is during the summer months . Afterwards , cool down with a cold Hefeweizen at the gorgeous Chinesischer Turm ( Chinese Tower ) beer garden , which is the second biggest beer garden in the city with 7,000 ( ! ) seats . <h> The Michael Jackson Memorial <p> This is definitely Munich 's quirkiest sight " a memorial dedicated to the King Of Pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2009 when fans rushed to the Bayrischer Hof hotel where he usually stayed when he was in town , lit candles and left little messages .

Since I am now spending my third summer in a row in New York City and have stumbled across a few more awesome things that are n't  necessarily in the guidebooks , I thought it was time to follow up with five more things that most tourists and locals never do and they all do n't  cost a thing ! Without further ado five free cool New York experiences that I highly recommend , all far from the usual Manhattan tourist stuff : <h> Soak up history in Sylvan Terrace <p> This is the only thing on my list that is located in Manhattan , but far north in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholas Ave , ( easy to miss look out for the small set of stairs on your left if you 're heading south , the street is elevated ) , and part of the Jumel Terrace Historic District . The street is one of the few remaining cobblestone streets in New York and consists of 20 wooden rowhouses facing each other at the end of which you 'll find the historic Morris-Jumel Mansion , the oldest building in Manhattan ( built in 1765 ) . The mansion has been turned into a museum and can be visited Tuesday Sunday ( admission $10 ) , but even just a stroll along Sylvan Terrace will transport you into a different era , and it is hard to imagine that this area was largely rural when the houses were erected in the late 18th century . What is unique to the houses are that they all look exactly the same with their high stoops , door overhangs , hand-painted house numbers and the yellow , green and maroon color schemes . If you 've watched Boardwalk Empire , you might recognize the street from one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also check out the beautiful Trinity Cemetery ( right off Broadway , between 153 and 155 Str ) , have a cup of excellent coffee at the Chipped Cup ( Broadway , between 148 &amp; 149 St ) or stop for some of the best Dominican food in New York at Malecon ( Broadway and 175 Str ) . If you do n't  want to venture that far , combine your visit with a walk through Highbridge Park , named after the citys oldest standing bridge , connecting Manhattan with the Bronx , which just reopened after more than 40 years for pedestrians after expansive restoration work , and offers lovely views over the Harlem River . The large cliffs and rock outcroppings in the park which are a good indication of what this area used to look like before it was urbanized . <p> How to get here:Take the C Train to 163 Str Amsterdam Ave or the 1 Train to 157 Str . <h> Go on a street art tour of Bushwick <p> When I came to New York the first time , Bushwick was known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived there . During my second summer of living in New York , it was hyped as the most up-and-coming neighborhood in Brooklyn .

The Bushwick Collective is a group of street artists who have been working together in order to facilitate the creation of murals ( instead of mindless graffiti and tagging ) in this neighborhood and their reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who now stop in Bushwick when they 're passing through New York to add a piece there ( most recently Kobra , but also street artists like Roa , Icy And Sot and Stik have painted walls in Bushwick ) . I marked the best spots for street art in this handy map for you ( you can save the pdf version on your iPad / smartphone via this link ) , but if you do n't  do well with maps or are too scared to venture into Shwick on your own , you can join a free Bushwick Street Art Tour with Free Tours By Foot and learn a whole lot of back stories about the street artists who colored the walls here and even have them point out the unassuming Robertas to you .. hint hint ) . While you 're in Bushwick , check out some of my favorite bars and eateries : Arepera Guacuco for arepas , Little Skips for mouthwatering grilled cheeses and coffee , Tutus , 983 or Forrest Point for brunch , the Sampler or the Pine Box Rock Shop for a great variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Swallow Cafe , Cuban-style Cafeteria La Mejor for and AP Cafe for decent coffee , Robertas for pizza ( are you getting the hint yet ? ) . <p> How to get there:Take the L train to Morgan Ave or Jefferson St. ( Jefferson St is closer to the Bushwick Collective murals ) . <h> Marvel at historic homes in Prospect Lefferts Gardens <p> Prospect Lefferts Gardens is another Brooklyn neighborhood that 's not on a lot of peoples radar , even though parts of it are a designated historic landmark and its just around the corner from Prospect Park . PLG is known for its large Caribbean population , but as in so many Brooklyn neighborhoods , gentrification has arrived and in recent years , the ethnically diverse residents have been seeing a large number of a new race move in : white people ! The still affordable apartments around here make PLG increasingly popular with Manhattanites who are forced to leave the island due to the ever present rent spikes , but even here new studio apartments go for $1,850 and more these days.I recommend strolling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln Road to the north , bordered by Flatbush Avenue to the west and Rogers Avenue to the East , a four block radius , which is where the homes in Neo-renaissance , Neo-Georgian , Neo-Federal , Romanesque revival , and later Tudor-revival style , that give the neighborhood its Historic District status , are located . If you feel like venturing a little further , add Sterling Street and Lefferts Avenue between Bedford Avenue and Nostrand Avenue.The neat tree-lined streets of the Historic District are a stark contrast to the less pretty Flatbush Avenue , lined with project housing , cheapie shops and Caribbean food joints , but you should n't skip this area because this is where some of the famed Caribbean food can be found , for example MangoSeed , Peppas Jerk Chicken , De Hot Pot or Alis Trinidad Roti Shop , If you are in search of good coffee , stop by the Tugboat Tea Company , for good coffee plus breakfast or American food , stop at Tip Of The Tongue , or at the cozy Blessings Cafe for a delicious breakfast . If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House . If you happen to find yourself in New York around Labor Day , do n't  miss the Caribbean Carnival of the West Indian-American Day Parade.If you feel like walking off your food , I recommend a stroll through Prospect Park which has some of the most beautiful parts close to PLG , like the boathouse and the lake . <p> How to get there : Take the B or Q Train and get off at Prospect Park . Alternatively , take the 2 or the 5 to Sterling Street . <h> Go for a stroll in Green-Wood Cemetery <p> Green-Wood Cemetery is another often overlooked Brooklyn gem , but possibly the most beautiful cemetery in New York City , and even was the largest cemetery in the world at the end of the 19th century ! There is a famous saying in New York that goes It is the ambition of the New Yorker to live upon the Fifth Avenue , to take his airings in Central Park , and to sleep with his fathers in Green-Wood . The 478-acre cemetery was one of Americas first rural cemeteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located way beyond New Yorks city borders . The rolling hills make for a wonderful stroll along the historic graves , ponds , impressive family shrines and monuments to civil war heroes , and up to the top of Battle Hill , the highest point in Brooklyn from where you have terrific views over Brooklyn and all the way to Manhattan . Green-Wood is the resting place of many famous New Yorkers , ranging from politicians and entertainers to baseball legends and artists.If you 're interested in learning more about the history of the cemetery and some of the scandals of notable people who are buried here , Free Tours By Foot also runs a free ( tip-based ) 2-hour tour here , which guarantees that you find places like the Memorial Obelisk , the Minerva Statue or the Civil War Soldiers Monument . Alternatively , you can download the free Discover Green-Wood app , which includes a self-guided walking tour with all the information you could possibly ask for.How to get there:Take the R Train to 25 Street or the D , N and R Train to 36 Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the summer and 5pm in the winter . <h> Discover the real Little Italy in the Bronx <p> Most people know that Manhattans Chinatown and Little Italy are only smaller versions of their bigger , more authentic counterparts on the other side of the river but there are also many New Yorkers who do n't  have a clue what you 're talking about when you mention Arthur Avenue . While the substantially larger Chinatown in New York can be found in Flushing , Queens , the real Little Italy can be found in the Bronx and for people who are intimated by this giant borough , a stroll around Arthur Avenue and the adjacent streets are the perfect introduction to the Bronx . Little Italy is generally considered the area across East 187th Street from Arthur Avenue to Prospect Avenue , and the first Italian immigrants settled here in the 19th century to help building the Bronx Zoo , and later on the Third Avenue elevated train . The Arthur Avenue area , sometimes also referred to as Belmont , offers some of the finest Italian-American establishments in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espresso machine vendors . The Bronx Little Italy shows you a refreshingly different side of New York City , but with its red brick buildings , Italian markets and tree-lined streets one that you 'll be happy to explore . Take your time and step into the Arthur Avenue Market , stop at Belmont institutions such as Madonia Brothers Bakery , Cosenza Fish Market , La Casa Della Mozzarella or Cerini Coffee . And make sure to come hungry you 'll want to eat at one of the authentic Italian eateries or at least sample some Italian pastries and coffee at one of the irresistible pastry shops.I personally loved the pizza at 089 and the pastries at the Palombo Pastry Shop , but other recommended restaurants &amp; shops are : Mikes Deli for giant sandwiches ( inside the Arthur Avenue market ) , Cafe al Mercato ( also inside the market ) for the best espresso , Terranova Bakery for fresh bread ( rated #1 bread in NYC ! ) , Borgattis for fresh pasta , Tra Di Noi for what is often declared the best Italian food on Arthur Avenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visit to the nearby New York Botanical Gardens . Admission is free all day on Wednesdays and between 9am and 10am on Saturdays.How to get there:The easiest way is taking the D Train to Fordham Road and walk east on 187 Street until you hit Arthur Avenue ( about 15 mins walking ) . The faster way is taking the 343 Train towards North White Plains from Grand Central ( run by Metro-North railroad ) , which is only a twenty minute ride from Grand Central to Fordham Road . <p> Still looking for a hotel in New York City but not sure where to stay ?

Because my flight was out of Berlin , I decided to head there a day early to meet up with some friends before flying back to the States . <p> Most of the month was spent in New York , but I boarded a plane to Los Angeles yesterday , and- I 'll be spending the next few weeks in Southern California .. but I am getting ahead of myself . Let 's look back at the past 31 days : <h> Life Lately <p> First of all albeit traveling much less this month , I ended up sleeping in 8- different beds in the past 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for slowing downOverall , August was a weird month , because I felt somewhat unsettled and uneasy the entire time , even though I was ecstatic about being back in New York . I missed most of my beloved New York summer this year , and was happy to get to spend at least one month there . And August is such an amazing month in NYC " it was scorching hot ( much needed after I was chilly most of the time I was in Germany ! ) , there were plenty of outdoor activities : open-air movies , sunset dates , rooftop drinks , bike rides , New York pizza ( time to update my New York Pizza Guide again ) , beach days , kayaking , picnics in the park and island getaways ( Governors Island and Fire Island ) . I did n't get to do as much as I wanted , but reflecting on the past month- now I feel like I fit in a lot , considering the heavy workload I was dealing with . <p> One thing that made me feel uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a worrier , always concerned for my partner , my family , my friends , and when I know that somebody is not feeling well or facing some major hurdles , I ca n't help but hurting / worrying for- them. - If you are subscribed to my newsletter* , you know that my life is in turmoil at the moment , and I think what also contributed to me feeling so unsettled is that I am currently not able to plan much for the coming months . <p> On the bright side : I loved getting- back into a routine as that 's what I am craving at the moment : a workout routine , a fridge filled with my favorite foods , a kitchen to cook in , friends to hang out with . Not knowing where I 'll be two months from now makes me feel restless instead of excited to see what the future brings . I am definitely ready for a home base that goes beyond a few weeks at a time , something I already said at the beginning of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think to find a place to call home . For one , I am very picky and have a number of requirements that need to be fulfilled , and then there 's the issue that visa restrictions leave me with limited options . But that 's for another post . For now , let 's look at the highlights and lowlights of the past month : <h> What went right <p> Island getaway <p> Just when I started getting completely overwhelmed with work projects once again , I decided on a whim to join some of my friends out on Fire Island , where they were enjoying a little summer getaway . I 'd been trying to get out to Fire Island for the past two summers and I was ecstatic to finally see this highly-praised- little island off the coast of Long Island for myself . This happened to be during the hottest days of summer in New York , and it was just what the doctor had ordered . I did n't bring my laptop and I took a grand total of three photos the entire time I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get away from my laptop and the time suck that 's the internet . My time on the island was much too short , by the way , and just whetted my appetite for more . Hopefully next summer ! <p> One of the three photos I took on Fire Island <p> Kayaking in the East River <p> Another thing that 's been on my to-do-list for a really- long time ? Kayaking on the East River . There are several places where you can kayak for free during the summer on both the East River and the Hudson River , and the spot I had picked was Brooklyn Bridge Park for its great views over the Manhattan skyline right across the river . When I finally found time to go kayaking , it was cloudy and it even rained just before we hit the water , but it was a great experience nonetheless . The majestic skyline , being back in a kayak ( I had n't been in one since I went kayaking in Austin in May ) , and the best kayaking buddy one could ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juliana 's at Pebble Beach , one of my favorite places to watch the sunset from , and finished the night with New York Cheesecake and Brooklyn Blackout Cake . Perfect . <p> Reuniting with my bicycle <p> I know that the saying goes home is where the heart is ' but more fitting for me is home is where my bike is ' , and that 's New York City . After a failed attempt to release her from her temporary storage before flying to Germany in- June , I finally got Lola ( yes , she has a name ! ) back this month . Whizzing around New York on my bike is one of my favorite things to do in the summer ( see last Julys roundup ) , and even though I did n't get to take her out as often as I would have liked , it felt glorious every time we went for a wild ride . <h> What went wrong <p> Too little time with friends <p> It took me almost two weeks to get out of my work cocoon and my I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hood ' because I 'm so busy with work attitude , leaving not much time to see friends . Some of my closest friends in New York who I was really looking forward to see I did n't get to hang out with at all , which left me majorly disappointed , other friends I only got to see one or two times , and others only for a quick catch-up session . Too little time . Realizing how hard it is to schedule things with people left me feeling pretty frustrated " it seems like in New York everyone is always busy . But then- there were a few people who always made time for me and who were also up for spontaneous shenanigans , so not all hope is lost , I guess . <p> Poor time management <p> Goal for September : more Me-Time <p> I do n't want to blame spending not enough time with my friends only on them " I am also to be blamed here , because I feel like my time management was terrible this month . Considering how many hours I spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress on my workload than one would expect , and achieved less than I wanted to achieve . Most of the month I felt just overwhelmed by all the things I needed to get done and I even completely forgot two article deadlines . Luckily I remembered them the day before the articles were due and managed to meet them ( sacrificing sleep ) but this happened to me a couple of times in July already and I need to get more organized with the various projects I work on and clients I work with . Not only did I feel like I did n't get enough time with my friends , but I also felt like I did n't get enough much needed me-time , after barely having any time to myself in July . <p> Bitten- by a dog and not just any dog , but a dog I was dog sitting for . I had briefly mentioned- a difficult housesit in July 2015 , but it was n't difficult enough for me not to accept the offer for a repeat housesit this year when the client asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first for me : the dog bit me . It was quite a painful bite , and luckily I had just gotten all my vaccinations renewed when I was in Germany last month , which saved me the trip to the doctor . The pup and I made up again after it happened and ended our time together with a big love fest he is usually very sweet but I admit that for a minute I was really freaked out and got a little scared of the dog ( who is on meds for anxiety and depression ) . <p> He is the sweetest dog almost always . <p> Losing things <p> Here we go again , the most frequent mention- under What went wrong ' : me losing things . And I have to go back to- July , because I completely forgot to include in my July round-up that I left a brand new jacket in an airport toilet stall in London Gatwick " complete with my sister 's car keys in them . This caused a huge hassle of me getting to my sister 's house when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not to mention that I lost her spare set of car keys . Plus a jacket I really digged but only got to wear once . Despite emailing Gatwick 's Lost &amp; Found office and detailing my lost items , they were never to be seen again . <p> As long as I do n't  lose my camera right ? <p> This month , I left my portable charger in New York when I left for L.A. ( an- item- I use on a daily basis ! ! ) , I left earrings behind in several places , and god knows what else . Nothing was as bad as leaving my $300 headphones on a plane back in April- and a bunch of stuff in March , but still , I could 've done without losing anything or forgetting stuff in random- places . <h> Other happenings <p> Website ups &amp; downs <p> At first , I wanted to put it under What went right : Website progression but later in the month , it turned into What went wrong : Huge website hassle . I 've mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and running in June ( and July ) , and felt like I was finally making progress this month .

@@107143139 @2543139/ <h> Easy-breezy Island Life : Highlights of a Malta Road Trip <p> This is a warning I kept hearing whenever I mentioned I wanted to see some more of the island by renting a car for a day , so that I could explore the beaches that Malta is famous for , the little fishing villages , scenic cliffs and coastal views . <p> I decided to ignore the well-meant advice and the stories about the horrible Maltese drivers and rented a car anyway . Having driven in Rome 's mad traffic , in Mexico and in Argentina , I figured I 'd be fine . Driving on the left side of the road also ca n't scare me anymore after driving- in Central London , so I was just silently praying all the crazy drivers would stay at home while I was cruising down the narrow country roads.While Malta has a pretty good public transportation network , driving yourself is still better " you can stop whenever and wherever you want , even if it 's just a quick photo stop , you do n't have to rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places that are n't covered by the buses . I only paid G22 for a 24-hour rental , and you can add pick-up for an additional G10 ( and drop-off for another G10 ) . Even if you pay for pick-up , drop-off and the rental , I think this is a very affordable price , especially if you share the costs with someone.I had asked for the smallest car and this is what I got:Is n't this the cutest car ? ! <p> I was happy when my friend Umei decided to join me and off we went to our first stop : Marsaxlokk , a traditional fishing village in the south of the island . I fell in love with it the minute we got out of the car " look at these colors:The bay was filled with little fishing boats , called luzzu , which are known for being painted in bright colors and always having a pair of eyes on the front " supposedly to protect them from bad luck and the dangers out at sea.While the village seemed sleepy and laid-back when we visited it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fish market takes place here . Fishermen arrive with their fresh catch in the port where dozens of stalls sell the seafood right on the spot.Similar to the medieval city of Mdina , I had the feeling I was stepping back in time here.It felt like not much had changed here in the last few decades " the village seemed to be exactly the way it was in a time before TVs , cell phones and the internet ( if you blocked out the tourists who were sharing their experience with the world via Instagram and Facebook ) . We continued on to the Dingli Cliffs from here , to take in some of the spectacular coastline . The Dingli Cliffs are the highest point in Malta , at 253 meters ( 830feet ) , and you can usually look out over the Mediterranean for miles and miles . When we were there it was slightly foggy , but we still got a sense for how majestic the cliffs are , and loved the surrounding countryside that was filled with spring wildflowers.If you want to discover more of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to glide along the cliffs , while you learn more about the history and the nature of Dingli , and it includes stops at some of the landmarks around here , like the Magdalena Chapel , Palazzo Verdala and Palazzo Girgenti , and the Boschetto Gardens.Here it is not uncommon to see horse-drawn carriages , old-fashioned traveling merchants and village people who still travel on foot.Even though the cliffs were stunning , we also wanted to see some of the amazing beaches that we had heard so much about.Malta is known to have some of the clearest waters in the Mediterranean , and when we finally reached Mellieha Bay , I wish it would 've been warmer already so that I could 've dipped more than just my toes into the crystal clear waterWhen we got to Golden Bay , clouds had started to cover the blue skies , but I could still imagine how gorgeous this place must be on a sunny summer day.We had reached the northernmost point on our road trip " which was nearly the northernmost point of the island ! Malta is just so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island in a daylong road trip.Before heading south again , we stopped at a roadside stall that was n't much more than a table with a couple of boxes of strawberries on it " some of the biggest strawberries we 'd ever seen ! We could n't resist and had to pick up a box . They were the perfect road trip snack.We could n't pass through Mosta , one of the bigger cities on the island , with a population of nearly 20,000 people , without stopping at the Mosta Dome ( also known as the Rotunda of Mosta ) , which is not only the third-largest unsupported dome in the world , but is also home to the Miracle Of Mosta : In 1942 , during World War II , a 200kg bomb was dropped by the German Luftwaffe over the church in which 500 people were hiding and did NOT detonate . Mosta Dome is impressive , but Mosta itself was also really pleasant.On the way back to Valletta we passed through St Julian 's just in time to see Spinola Bay lit up during the twilight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular holiday spots on the island , with lots of hotels and restaurants , and we joined the wandering tourists for a stroll along the promenade where the gorgeous LOVE sculpture has become a popular place with lovers , who lock up their love here.If you are planning a visit to Malta , I highly recommend renting a car and seeing the island that way " at least for a day or two . Places you should n't miss include Valletta , Mdina , Mellieha Bay , Marsaxlokk , the Dingli Cliffs and St Julian's.This post was brought to you as a result of the Blog Island Malta campaign , created and managed by iambassador in partnership with the Malta Tourism Authority and the support of Air Malta .

This website is a great resource for using public buses on Malta : http : //www.maltabybus.com/ I think if you only plan to visit a couple of places during your trip to Malta , you should be fine using the buses . But if you 'd like to cram in as much as possible , stop in random places along the way , and do n't  want to have to rely on bus times , a car makes more sense . <p> The water starts warming up mid-June , btw by August its bathtub-warm = <p> Rachel nobody is ever talking about Malta and I just do n't  understand why ! One of the most underrated places in the Mediterranean in my opinion . <p> P.S. Your comment about the new site design totally made my day when I read it = Thanks so much Rachel ! There 's more to come , but I could n't stand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new header already . <p> Thanks , Katie ! I cant wait to go back to Malta and go for a swim in the ocean ! Will make sure to head there in August or September the next time so that I know the water will be warmer than it was in May = <p> Katie absolutely ! When you mentioned Majorca I realize that I usually like renting a car on small Mediterranean islands .. did it in Ibiza &amp; Formentera and Majorca as well = I just love the freedom and independence a car gives you . <p> We have just had one week in Gozo and we hired a car as well and travelled everywhere , i must admit we got lost a few times , but we did get a lot of help from the locals and we stopped a lot of times along the way to check the views , and had a swim at San Bais Bay . which was so hard to get to , but it was worth it . we will be going to Malta tomorrow , and staying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drivers are not too bad at all , you always get the odd crazy driver even in Australia . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107143142 @2543142/ <h> 5 Best Moments From 5 Years Of Travel <p> Since I am celebrating the milestone of five years of travel this weekend I felt that it was time to look back at the past five years , but I had done that just a while ago ( Looking Back : Five Years Ago I Quit My Job To Travel The World ) . So I decided to share the five best and worst travel experiences instead . To be honest : I find it impossible to narrow it down to only a handful experiences there are so many things that come to mind . Some are obvious , like my four-day trek to Machu Picchu or walking over the Golden Gate Bridge , exploring the Maya and Aztec ruins in Mexico , boarding down a volcano in Nicaragua , visiting Angkor Wat , touring Bolivias striking salt flats , hiking in Patagonia , spending time with elephants in Thailand ( not riding them ! ) cruising through the backwaters of Kerala in Southern India or living in a farmhouse in Tuscany . I could easily find a favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided to share the five things that popped into my head immediately : <h> Climbing an active volcano in Guatemala <p> I 've climbed several volcanoes over the years , but scrambling up the rock-covered steep side of Pacaya , an active volcano in Guatemala , was the most memorable one . The closer we came to the top , the hotter the ground became , until we finally saw glowing lava and were even allowed to climb into a small hole not far from the peak , which felt like a sauna and had me fear my camera lens as well as the bottoms of my shoes would melt . When we were resting on top of the volcano before making our way back down , some people were even making smores over the lava heat ! Experiencing an active volcano that way was an unforgettable experience , and Guatemala is still one of the most beautiful countries Ive visited . <h> Hiking through Israels Negev Desert <p> I was wondering why this experience popped into my head before my trek through the Peruvian Andes , even though that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Incas . But while there was n't a wonder of the world waiting for me at the end , the multi-day trek through the Negev Desert tested me like no other hike has tested me ( up to now ) : the almost unbearable heat , the relentless sun , nothing but rocks and sands for miles and miles . It was the first time that I slept under the desert sky , filled with millions of stars a sight I will never forget . Walking for days through this barren and yet bizarrely beautiful landscape that does n't  allow any life to flourish was a humbling experience and I was proud that I managed to finish the strenuous trek . <h> Housesitting on a Caribbean beach <p> Even though this housesit was n't always easy , it is one of my favorite housesits to date and I would go back in a heartbeat . ( Side note : Housesitting in itself should be one of my five favorite travel experiences because it has been the absolute best thing I 've started doing when I hit the road and has allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world rather than just passing through as a tourist ) . The beach house was an off-the-grid house in Mexico , a few miles north of the border- to Belize , and came with its own private stretch of white , powdery sand beach and the Mesoamerican Reef right in the backyard . I could literally run into the ocean right after waking up and snorkel through the colorful coral life of the worlds second largest reef . There was a local caretaker who would climb the palm trees to cut fresh coconuts straight from the tree , I made Huevos Rancheros every morning for two months straight , and the dog I was taking care of was adorable . The downsides of the housesit werent insignificant ( escaping a hurricane , terrible wi-fi , no cell phone reception , basic living , lots of responsibility , and tears when I had to leave the dog I 'd fallen in love with ) and yet it was one of the most amazing experiences of my travels . <h> Swimming with sharks and turtles <p> Had I written this post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belize was one of my all-time travel experiences but then I went to the Philippines and swam in some of the most breathtaking snorkeling spots in the world , including getting close to several sea turtles ( an experience that was equally as awe-inspiring on land , when I witnessed a turtle arribada in Costa Rica in 2012 ) . Snorkeling off the coast of Caye Caulker , Belize , is still the best snorkeling experience I 've had so far , simply because you get to swim with all of these ocean creatures : sharks , sting rays , turtles , manatees , hundreds of colorful fish and along the same stunning reef I mentioned above . I 'd go back to Belize just to snorkel there again , but to be fair , I also loved snorkeling in the Red Sea and in Thailand , even though the marine life in Belize is unbeatable . <h> Living in New York City <p> New York City is without a doubt my favorite city in the world , I love everything about it the diverse neighborhoods , the fact that every language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of ethnic food jaunts , the fact that you never run out of things to do , the architecture , the parks , the hidden speakeasys , the food markets and flea markets , the summers , the fact that I can travel within the city limits and feel like I 've left the country , the vibrant atmosphere , Broadway plays , the street art , the fact that I could never run out of things to do there and that the city is constantly changing and evolving . <p> After spending two months in New York in the summer of 2013 , I realized just how much I loved the city and that I wanted I spend more time there ideally on a regular basis . Last year , I initially came to New York for a 1-month housesit , and ended up spending nearly five months in the city a dream come true . I spent more time in New York than anywhere else in the past five years , and I 've considered shipping my moving boxes over there several times . But then I remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been successfully avoiding for half a decade now . So for now , I am hoping to continue spending the summers there and would be lying if I said that my months in New York werent my absolute favorite travel moments . 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 17 Comments <p> Like you said , its so hard to narrow it down !

But there have many so many good times , its hard to keep track ! Hopefully it stays that way ! <p> Allison I am so happy to hear that you also loved the Elephant Nature Park = Road tripping through the Scottish Highlands is also an all-time travel highlight of mine , but since I did n't  do that in the past five years , I did n't  mention it . <p> Definitely , spending all night on top of Volcan Pacaya is one of the best travel experiences on my list too !

The Lazy Lizard still is one of my most memorable bars . <p> And now for the kicker and this is why your post has touched me so , I 've been living in New York City for 23 years and I adore it . I love everything about it , even when those terrible rush hour train rides test my limits , I think : " Hey its New York City and there is nothing like it ! " With all its challenges , I still would not live anywhere else . I even love its winters ! Seeing the city covered in snow ( at least for the first 12 hours , then the snow gets dirty ) can be so lovely and magical . <p> Vanessa reading your comment gave me chills ! Wow ! ! It seems like we like very similar things ! I did actually spend two days in NYC in the winter one year the day when the first blizzard of the season hit .

If you make it , I hope you have a wonderful time . = <p> Sounds like you 've had a great time over the past five years . All of it looks amazing and it must be such a great experience . So many of the things you have done that I would like to do myself , especially spending time with Elephants ( and yes not riding them ) . <p> Its hard to choose my favourite travel moments too !

I will break down my findings for you in this article , but let 's start with the question : <h> What is a timeshare ? <p> A timeshare is a property ( usually a unit at a resort ) which is shared by several owners . Each owner holds rights to use the property and is allotted a certain period of time in which they can use the property . Ownership is either deeded , like traditional real estate , or it is sold as Right to Use for a fixed period ( for instance , 50 years ) . Timeshares are condominium units within a bigger complex that is taken care of by the timeshare developer selling and maintaining the units . Typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks every year , or sometimes every other year . The attractive aspects of a timeshare are the guaranteed vacations , that the units are maintained while you 're not using it , and that you can gift your stay to somebody else if you ca n't use it ( a family member , for example ) . In addition to the unit they own , timeshare owners can take advantage of the additional features the complex has , which range from indoor/outdoor swimming pools and hot tubs , spas , fitness facilities , family game rooms , and golf courses . <p> There are different kinds of timeshares : in some cases , you buy the timeshare for a specific week per year ( Fixed Week ) , or you can choose a certain week within a given period , for example fall or spring ( Floating ) . There are also Points-based programs , which allow you to use your allocation of Points like vacation currency to book at resorts within your ownership 's network or club . <p> Timeshares are not only offered by independent developers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their own timeshare brands , for example : Marriott Vacation Club , Hyatt Residence Club , Worldmark by Windham or Starwood Vacation Ownership . And for Disney lovers there 's the Disney Vacation Club . So , if you have a preferred hotel brand , you might want to look into their timeshare division . The benefit of these timeshare brands is that you can usually become a member of a worldwide or nationwide program rather than investing in one single property and returning to the same place over and over again . <h> Timeshare vs hotel <p> The great thing about timeshares are that they are almost always luxury accommodations and basically a fully functioning apartment with top-notch appliances , whereas , if you are staying at a hotel , you only get one room and no kitchen . If you prefer a more home-y ' feel , enjoy preparing your own meals and having more than just one room , timeshares are for you . <p> Another benefit of staying in a timeshare is the community aspect , which is particularly interesting for couples who like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . At your timeshare , you 'll likely meet the same people every year and can form long-lasting friendships . <h> Who are timeshares for ? <p> Timeshares are for people who enjoy spending a week or two each year in their favorite place . People from the Midwest for example often enjoy a desert getaway to Arizona or Palm Springs , people from the Northeast love an escape to Florida " especially during the colder months . <p> But timeshares are n't just located in sunny or tropical locations ( the Caribbean islands , Hawaii and Mexico are popular timeshare destinations ) you can also find them in many big cities around the world : New York , London , Berlin " just to name a few ! So , if you love one of these places and enjoy returning there year after year , it makes sense to look into buying a timeshare . Not only do you know where you 'll be staying every time you visit , but it 's also much cheaper than renting a place and it saves you the hassle of researching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> How to buy a timeshare <p> The most important thing when buying a timeshare : do n't go through the timeshare developers but go through a timeshare marketplace like SellMyTimeShareNow.com . A website like SMTN acts as an intermediary for timeshare sellers and buyers and offers considerably better deals than the developers . Resales only cost you the fraction of what you 'd pay if you buy from a developer , and the intermediary helps you during every step along the way . <h> When is a timeshare worth it ? <p> If you are looking on the resale market , it is not unusual to find timeshares for less than $10,000 these days , and a timeshare that cheap can pay off within ten years . Which means after that , you 'll be almost staying for free ( I am saying- almost- because there are still maintenance fees to be paid , however , you will still pay considerably less than what a week 's accommodation in a hotel of a comparable standard would cost you ) . <p> It 's worth purchasing a timeshare if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item , so you need to use it to get the benefit from it . However , if you plan to vacation for at least one week annually and you know how you want to vacation ( same place every year versus a new location every year ) , working with a timeshare resale company can be a great way to find the perfect timeshare to fit your lifestyle at a great discount as well . <h> Timeshare Rentals <p> You do n't have to buy a timeshare , by the way ! You can also rent one for a week to spend your vacation in these amazing resorts . In the same way that you can buy a timeshare on the secondary market ( which just means you are purchasing from a current owner rather than directly from the timeshare developer ) , you can also rent timeshares on the secondary market . Many owners will offer amazing last minute deals , which are much cheaper than hotels at a comparable standard ; take a look here : <h> SellMyTimeshareNow.com " how does it work ? <p> SellMyTimeshareNow.com is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeshares all over the U.S. and beyond and is the global leader in connecting timeshare sellers , buyers and renters . The properties offered on SellMyTimeshareNow.com are often up to 70% cheaper than the retail purchase price , because you do n't have to pay for the high marketing expenses that timeshare developers face . In addition , because the units are being sold by the owner for whatever reason , these owners are often willing to accept a lower offer in order to close a deal quickly . <p> On SellMyTimeshareNow.com , you can find the most reputable timeshare brands and you can easily filter timeshares by selecting the timeshare resort of your choice , which is shown in each listing : <p> Alternatively , you can filter timeshares by destination , if the brand is of secondary importance , but you know where in the world you 'd like to own a unit . <p> Once you find a timeshare you are interested in and click on it , you get a detailed description of the property , including amenities of the unit and amenities of the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important information such as the maintenance fees , the type of ownership , and how often you can use the unit . <p> If it meets all your requirements , you can simply send off an inquiry and you 'll hear back from the owner to begin the negotiation process . If you 'd rather have SellMyTimeshareNow act as a go-between with an owner , you can simply call their 800 number to get things started . <p> The same goes for timeshare rentals " if you are looking for an inexpensive getaway , for example in Mexico , just select the region of your choice and it will show you all the destinations in the regions that have available timeshare rentals : <h> Things to consider when buying a timeshare <p> First of all : a timeshare is a long-term commitment . Most timeshare ownerships are lifelong . So , take your time when looking to buy a unit , do n't rush into a purchase . If you 're not 100% sure about a purchase , keep looking . <p> It is also a good idea to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are unsure about buying a unit , spend a week in a timeshare rental , then decide if you want to commit to spending time there every year for the next two or three decades . While staying in the rental , you can also visit several other timeshare properties in the area to make sure you are choosing the best ownership in your desired destination . Do your research before your visit and come prepared . <p> Make sure your purchase is being run through a licensed , bonded , insured title agency and that all money is held in escrow until the timeshare ownership is legally transferred into your name . It 's also not a bad idea to have a legal professional review the contract for you before you sign anything . <h> Can you sell your timeshare ? <p> Yes , you can sell your timeshare. - It is quite common that timeshare owners ca n't use their unit anymore for whatever reason . Since you 're still stuck with maintenance fees , no matter if you 're using the unit or not , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you want to sell your timeshare , SellMyTimeshareNow.com is the perfect marketplace to advertise your unit , and you 'll be assisted from start to finish in selling your timeshare including affiliated closing and transfer services . <h> Rent your timeshare <p> Alternatively , you can use SellMyTimeshareNow.com as a platform to rent your timeshare if you can not use it yourself . That way , you cover your maintenance fees and do n't end up losing money . This is also a great way to secure a potential buyer as the traveler may like the unit and resort so much they decide they want to purchase as well . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Once again , it seemed like an impossible task .

@@107143147 @2543147/ <h> Colorful New York : A fall foliage road trip <p> I am not sure when I started to dislike fall , but I think it must have been during my years in England . Fall , or autumn as the Brits say , always seemed to define itself through rain and foggy days , and while those misty London mornings could be romanticized initially , the novelty wore off quickly , replaced by the melancholy over yet another rainy day.Once I packed up my London apartment and started traveling , I started chasing the sun and skipping spring , winter and autumn completely . Until I happened to be in the U.S. in October a couple of years later , amazed by how colorful and sunny this season was in the Midwest . It was my first time experiencing pumpkin patches , corn mazes and pumpkin spiced treats . Suddenly , autumn felt wonderful , and not dreary at all . Instead of rainy days and grey skies , I was enchanted by blue skies and autumn leaves in vibrant colors.When I was told that those colors werent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the trees in the New England states on the East Coast had even more vivid fall colors in October , I put a New England road trip on my travel wish list right away.I was hoping to finally fulfill this dream last year , but you might remember that I ran out of time when I came back to New York for a few weeks in October and ended up going only on a day trip to the scenic Seven Lakes region in Upstate New York.So this year I was determined to finally head up to Vermont . Spoiler alert : I still did n't  make it there ! However , I managed to go on an upstate road trip for several days , instead of just a rushed one day out-of-town getaway . And yes , I couldve made it all the way up to New Hampshire and Vermont , but I wanted to set some time aside to enjoy the scenery , go on hikes and unleash my inner child in the leaves ( which I did ) , picking up farm-fresh apples and stopping in random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much time in the car.Speaking of the car : I gave the new Silvercar app a try , which is quite different from your usual car rental experience . I 've rented cars in Manhattan before , and it 's usually neither cheap nor pleasant , especially if you plan to go away over a weekend . Tiny rental offices in Manhattan , long lines , and often mediocre customer service , given the amount of customers car rental clerks have to deal with here on a daily basis.What makes Silvercar different from other car rental companies ? First of all , the entire Silvercar fleet is made up by silver Audi A4s . You always know exactly which car you get . Secondly , as I mentioned above , it 's an entirely app-based experience , which makes sense in today 's world where I do pretty much everything on my smartphone " be it renting apartments via the AirBnb app or hotels through the Booking.com app , deciding which restaurant to eat it with the help of Tripadvisor and Yelp , or navigating directions with GoogleMaps.When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message confirming your booking and on the day of your reservation you 'll get a text from Silvercar asking you to send a text when you 're about ten minutes away from the rental location , giving the valet a heads-up to get the car out of the garage for you . I opened the car by scanning a QR code on the windshield , and after a short introduction to the functionalities and perks of the car , including how to connect to the in-car wifi and Bluetooth and how to use the navigation system ( all of which are included in the price ) , we were ready to go . The whole process did n't take longer than five minutes and not having to wait in line at a rental office felt great.If you 'd like to give Silvercar a try " they are currently operating out of ten cities in the U.S. , and their New York location is based in Midtown Manhattan , close to the Lincoln Tunnel and West Side Highway , conveniently located to get you out of town quickly . Day rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weekend rental , which is in line with every other car rental companies in Manhattan . But none of the others can guarantee you an Audi A4 and the premium valet experience at that price ! So instead of getting an average car for this rate , why not try Silvercar and get a fabulous car and a select experience instead ? Shortly after crossing the George Washington Bridge and leaving Manhattan , we found ourselves surrounded by brilliant fall colors along the Palisades Parkway , which would bring us to our first destination : Bear Mountain State Park , about 50 miles north of New York City . We wanted to attempt climbing up to the peak of the mountain , from where I knew we 'd have fantastic views over the Hudson River and when the weather was good you could see four states from the top of Perkins Memorial Tower atop of the mountain : New York , New Jersey , Connecticut and Pennsylvania.The hike , which took about three hours in total , was steep at times , but the panoramic vistas were definitely worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B&amp;Bs throughout the trip , which is why I spent hours researching places on AirBnB . I am recommending some of my favorite finds at the end of this post.We crossed the river and continued on east of the Hudson River because we wanted to stop in Poughkeepsie the next day , where we wanted to cross the Hudson once again " but this time , on foot . The Walkway Over The Hudson , which is at 1.28 miles the longest pedestrian bridge in the world , seemed like the perfect place to take in the fall foliage from . At 212 feet above the rivers surface , it is n't for the faint at heart but I kept my fear of heights under control by staying away from the rails.I loved how beautiful the yellow leaves on the trees on the path leading up to the bridge looked , forming a natural tree tunnel . The walk over the bridge and back takes about an hour , depending how often you stop to take pictures.After that , we headed further north into the Catskill Mountains west of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which passed through the towns of New Paltz , Kingston and Woodstock " and it ended up being unbelievably scenic at this time of year . We could n't help but stop in several of the towns to check out some antiques shops and galleries along the main roads . Seeing these charming towns all dressed up for autumn , with pumpkins decorating entrances of houses and window sills , stacks of hay , fall flowers and restaurant menus denouncing seasonal specials , filled me with so much joy . <p> We stopped on the side of the road to pick up some farm-fresh apples , but we couldve easily filled the car with just about everything the farmers were offering : homemade jams , pumpkins in all shapes and sizes , apple cider and fresh honey.The next morning , I woke up just in time to witness a spectacular fiery red autumn sunrise , the air wonderfully crisp , the kind of day that is perfect for a hike through the woods and is waiting to be finished with a mug of hot apple cider by the fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Catskills Mountains , but the further north we went , the barer the trees had become " here , the leaves had already fallen from the branches , leaving the ground covered in brown and red leaves.That was n't a bad thing though on our hike to the Kaaterskill Waterfalls the leaves felt like a soft carpet on the ground , causing a crackling sound in the otherwise silent forest as our feet touched them . I could have spent many more days hiking in the Catskills " a list of trails I had found online made me wish I had time for some of the longer hikes in these mountains.But luckily the Catskills are en route to Vermont 's scenic Green Mountain Byway , which I hope I 'll finally make it to next year . 129333 @qwx989333 <p> The State Of New York publishes a fall foliage report for all regions , which helps you to find out the perfect time to go .

Cannes is so much more than the film festival that makes into the worldwide news every year , when Hollywood stars conglomerate in France 's most sophisticated and glamorous beach destination . But what makes Cannes so special outside of the Cannes Film Festival ? We 're sharing five reasons why Cannes is worth a visit : <p> 1 La Croisette <p> A long , elegant , palm tree-lined boulevard that stretches along the seafront for miles , La Croisette ca n't be missed on a visit to Cannes . It is here where the rich &amp; famous shop whose yachts you can see lined up in one of Cannes ' marinas . You find plenty of upscale boutiques here , sidewalk cafes and restaurants , or you could just go for a stroll and marvel at the beautiful villas on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Make sure to walk all the way down to the Old Port , Vieux Port , for the scenic views . <p> 2 Iles de Lerins <p> The Iles de Lerins are two wooded islets just off the coast of Cannes which have been famously inhabited by monks for many centuries . The monks produce the tasty Lerina liqueur on Saint Honorat and also organize wine tastings for visitors . You can even stay in a hostel in the abbey on the island to experience the simple life the monks there are living . The other island , Saint Marguerite , is famous for its gorgeous beaches and clear waters that make you think you 're in the Caribbean instead of the Mediterranean ! There are regularly boat trips to the isles from Gare Maritime hourly during the summer months ( and less frequently during the winter ) . <p> 3 The beautiful beaches <p> Cannes stretches along the sea for over four miles ( 7 kilometers ) " and the beaches are stunning . The beach that stretches along La Croisette Boulevard is of course the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' beach front is public " there are several private beaches right in the city . Among the best public beaches are Zamenhof Beach and Mace Beach ( both right by Croisette Boulevard ) , Moure Rouge Beach near the fishing ports and the golden sand beach La Bocca . Most of the private beaches can be visited too , by the way , but they charge up to G20 admission . <p> 4 Le Suquet : The Old Town <p> The Old Town raises up on the mountainside of Mont Chevalier , overlooking the entire bay . This is what used to be the original fishing village that eventually turned into what Cannes is today . The setting of this neighborhood could n't be more picturesque , and the views over the red roofs of Cannes and the Mediterranean from up here are breathtaking . Traffic is n't allowed , which means you can fully enjoy the narrow alleyways and staircases , courtyards and ancient walls .

In addition to luxury shops for fashionistas , you 'll find food and flower markets as well as flea markets in Cannes ' Old Town . <p> 5 The stunning Notre-Dame d'Esperance church <p> This provencal Gothic church will show you that Cannes has so much more to offer than the Film Festival . History buffs will appreciate the wood paneling that dates back to the 14th century and the collection of 19th century paintings . It 's the most significant church in town . The views from the church are also some of the most terrific ones in Cannes , given that Notre-Dame d'Esperance sits on top of the hill that is home to the Old Town . <h> Where to stay in Cannes <p> Check out Villa Les Palmes " 15 recently renovated apartments inside a traditional French Riveran-style building . The apartments are furnished in a modern , contemporary way and come with fully-equipped kitchens as well as amenities such as washing machines , dishes , WiFi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Croisetter and only a five-minute walk from the beach . You 're right in the middle of it all , and the apartments start at only G70 per night for two people or G75 for three people ! <h> How to get to Cannes <p> The closest airport is Nice , a 30-minute bus or taxi ride away . There are plenty of shuttle services that will bring you straight from the Nice Cote dAzur airport to Cannes . The train ride from the airport is the most scenic way to arrive since it runs right alongside the coast . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143150 @2543150/ <h> 10 things that surprised me about Stockholm <p> Having traveled to dozens of countries and hundreds of cities over the past five years , it is getting harder and harder to find places that surprise me . When I took the ferry from Helsinki to Stockholm for a quick weekend getaway in Sweden 's capital , I sure did n't think that Stockholm would surprise me , but there were several things that I did n't expect . And : I also did n't expect to love Stockholm as much as I did , to be honest ! I am already thinking about a return trip and how I can work Stockholm into my summer travel plans . I 'll tell you more about my weekend in Stockholm shortly , but here are ten things that surprised me : <h> 1 Stockholm is spread out over 14 Islands <p> I knew that there was a lot of water around Stockholm , but I had no idea that the city was in fact sitting on 14 islands ! These islands , located at the mouth of Lake M+laren , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very close together and connected by 57 ( ! ) bridges , and you can walk from island to island . Gamla Stan is the oldest one of them , the place where the first settlements of Stockholm were built in the 14th century . Stockholm actually translates log island ' ( Stock ' in Swedish is log ' , and holm ' means island ) . In Stockholm , you 're never far from the waterfront ' , one of our local guides told me , and for someone like me who loves the water , that makes the already beautiful city even more attractive to me . And if 14 islands are n't enough for you : the entire Stockholm archipelago is made out of 30,000 islands . <h> 2 So fresh and so clean <p> I knew that Stockholm was regularly listed as one of the prettiest cities in all of Europe , and yet I was still surprised to see how clean and neat the city was . There is no heavy industry , and that combined with the fresh sea air , is the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European capital , and Stockholm was the first capital to be honored the European Green Capital ' award . 95 % of the population lives less than 300 meters from a green space . The city is very active when it comes to building energy-efficient houses , sustainable land use , environmentally friendly local transport , the amount of public green spaces and recycling " I am a big fan . <h> 3 Fika is taken very seriously here ! <p> This is something I can definitely get behind the typical Swedish coffee break . As a German , I was very much reminded of our afternoon coffee and cake break ( Kaffee Und Kuchen ) , probably my favorite thing about German culture , but I think Fika is even a bit better . Why ? First of all , Swedes take their coffee culture serious . Instead of just a plain ol ' filter coffee , you get an espresso or cafe latte , always prepared with utmost professionalism . And the pastries you usually get with your coffee to die for ! Kannamummabulle ( cinnamon buns ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delicious , I was considering moving to Stockholm just for those . There are tons of coffee bars all over Stockholm , and I would make it my mission to try ( and rate ) them all . <p> Fika at Mellqvist Kaffebar <h> 4 You can follow in Lisbeth Salanders footsteps <p> If you do n't know who Lisbeth Salander is , you might want to skip to #6 , but if reading this name gets you as excited as it gets me , you will be delighted to hear that you can go on dedicated Millennium Tours which bring you to the apartment of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo , Blomqvistss apartment , Milton Security ( the company she worked for ) , and other places of interest from the popular trilogy . I have to admit that reading Stieg Larssons Trilogy was what first piqued my interest in Stockholm ( especially the S+dermalm neighborhood ) and while I did n't have time to join a Millennium Tour this time , I 've already put it on my must-do list for my next visit . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Stieg Larssons favorite coffee shop , and also that of his main character Mikael Blomqvist . <p> Kaffe , where Mikael Blomqvist ( Daniel Craig ) had coffee in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo <h> 5 Very cultural <p> Stockholm is one of the cities with the most museums per capita in the world , making it a paradise for cultural tourists . There are nearly 100 museums in the city ! The Nationalmuseum is Sweden 's biggest art museum with over 16,000 paintings and 30,000 handicraft objects , and you 've got something for every interest : modern art ( Moderna Museet ) , Fotografiska ( an excellent photography museum ) , Skansen ( an open-air museum on Swedish country life ) , the Vasa Museum ( famous for the reconstructed Vasa Ship ) , the Nordic Museum and the Stockholm City Museum on Swedish culture and the history of the city , and the list goes on and on . Stockholm is also home to the Nobel Museum , after Alfred Nobel decided to set up a fund in his name to commemorate advance science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1901 . <p> Fotografiska : a revamped industrial building which now houses a photography museum . And currently showing a Herb Ritts exhibit ! <p> And of course there is an ABBA museum " which only opened in 2013 , is interactive and even let 's you sing with the ABBAs on stage and record their songs , and already attracted over half a million visitors ! <p> In addition to all these museums , Stockholm is also home to a number of internationally acclaimed art galleries and several theaters . And UNESCO geeks can visit three World Heritage sites in the Stockholm region . <p> I also learned that Stockholm was home to the world 's longest art exhibition , which is its subway system " the tunnels are all covered in art " but I did n't spend enough time in the subway to truly appreciate this unique art gallery . <p> Some of my favorite art street art is hard to come by in Stockholm <h> 6 A city of cyclists <p> I personally love to ride a bike whenever possible , so of course one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are nearly 500 miles /800km of bike paths in Stockholm , and I could see myself cycle all over town all summer long . I am not sure if I would be as brave as the Stockholmers I saw on their bikes " considering that it was snowing heavily during my visit , there were quite a few cyclists ! " but judging by the amount of bikes that I saw around town under a thick layer of snow , I assume that nearly everyone in Stockholm owns a bike and that most of them use it year round . <h> 7 Booming restaurant scene <p> During my weekend in Stockholm I ate at several restaurants , and three of them had just opened . The restaurant scene in Stockholm is booming , with new restaurants opening all the time , expanding their space or adding another branch , and the food is very creative . There are meatballs of course ( which you have to try if you eat meat " I was told that they were so much better than meatballs anywhere else in the world ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was surprised to see such a large variety of international cuisines and beautifully designed restaurants ( I could add a whole paragraph about Swedish design here , which I absolutely loved ) . In total , there are over 1,000 restaurants in Stockholm . <h> 8 Stockholm in white looks even better ! <p> Confession : I am not the biggest fan of winter . I know , this is n't really news for most of you , but I usually despise the white stuff . In Stockholm , however , it did n't  faze me in the slightest that I was wandering around in a heavy snowstorm for hours , watching how the entire city got slowly covered in a white blanket . Stockholm is already incredibly picturesque , but the snow made it even prettier . I also loved how the snow was like a soundproof cover , swallowing every noise you usually hear in a city . On my walk around Gamla Stan , the Old Town , I felt like I was the only person out , and I cherished the silence . <h> 9 Independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain stores around the city instead , I stumbled upon boutique shop after boutique shop , independent book stores , and loads of independent design and clothes shops . Independent stores are definitely going strong in Stockholm , something I was happy to see in this age and day where the shopping streets are usually dominated by the same brands . ( Of course there are still big brands in Stockholm , and let 's not forget that both Ikea and H&amp;M were founded in Sweden ) .10 City of technology geniuses <p> Did you know that the computer game Minecraft , popular internet radio Spotify and internet telephone provider Skype were all invented in Stockholm ? Technology company Ericsson was also founded in Stockholm . I had no idea , but I am particularly grateful for Skype , which has made it so much easier for me to stay connected with family and friends on my travels who knew I was using something from Stockholm on a daily basis ! Have you been to Stockholm ? What were the things that surprised you about the city ? 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live in Stockholm and this post made me so happy . I really love it here and you 've captured the city beautifully . And yes , fika is very important , in January and February we eat semlor ( google it , they 're the best ! ) and everyone takes it very seriously . I will be leaving soon though to cycle around the world , others I would have loved to meet up with you when you get here again ! <p> I really love this article ! I also happen to have gone through a Girl With the Dragon Tattoo utter obsession and ever since have fantasized about visiting the city where it took place . Not to mention I recently became good friends with someone from Stockholm who really speaks so fondly of it . Hopefully sometime this year I will have a chance to visit ! <p> I have n't been yet , but looking forward to ! I love minecraft by the way = Anyway , I do respect any culture that appreciates a proper coffee and takes it seriously , for that alone would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amazing city with a lot to offer . I want to go too ! <p> Great post ! I love the fact that Stockholm is so environment friendly , that it has clean and fresh air to breathe . It is definitely one of the prettiest cities in Europe the islands have got to do a lot with it . Sounds like a cool mix of culture , nature and food ! And I have heard even the transport system is quite comfy there ! <p> I really enjoyed reading your article . Stockholm is one of those places I have n't visited yet , but I really ca n't wait to . It looks so beautifully and you 've really captured that beauty and charm and made me want to go even more . Being a coffee aficionado , I was totally was sold on just on Fika ! = <p> Scandinavia , and especially Sweden , has been on my to go list for years and now I want to go even more ! Mostly to follow in Lisbeths footsteps , but also for the design and food and coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my style . <p> Aah , another Lisbeth fan love it = The design is fabulous ! I cant wait to go back to see more of the city and the fabulous design , and to try more of the coffee shops . I am sure you 'd love Stockholm , Amanda ! <p> Stockholm is number one on my European cities to visit list and I hope to finally make it there in a couple of years time . I love the fact it is spread over 14 islands and I want to visit in Summer to visit some of the surrounding islands also <p> Zab and I are big fans of Sweden , having been there together about 6 times . We 've only been to Stockholm twice but really like it ( and well be going back in late July as we 've been asked to housesit again in the same place as last year ! ) ButIve never been in winter . Your pictures look lovely , but I reckon Stockholm is even better in summer , when you can really enjoy the outdoor spaces and the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost any bit of water you can access ! <p> I shouldve picked your brains before I went to Stockholm ! Now I am tempted to time my trip in the summer with your housesit = Like you say I bet its completely different in the summer and I wouldve love to experience it when its warm out . Fingers crossed that I can make it happen . <p> Yes ! That would be great if we were there at the same time this summer ! Its also when Stockholm Pride Week is on ( 27th July-1st August ) , which we checked out parts of last year and was super fun ! See you there ? ! <p> Thanks for such a great and thorough post Dany ! We have n't been to Stockholm yet , or anywhere in Sweden for that matter but after reading your post we just might head there sooner rather than later . = <p> What a fab blog ! I REALLY want to visit in Europe for a few months this yearand I would like to start in March:April . So running into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house sitting might be a great way for me to feel out a country before moving there for a few years . What a great idea ? ! <p> Any pointers on what NOT to do/what to look out for when accepting a house sitting gig ? <p> Thanks , Sandi ! I can highly recommend housesitting as way to just scope out a country and get a feel for it to see if you like it enough to live there ! Know lots of people who did exactly that , actually . The thing I recommend the most before accepting a housesit is ask lots of questions . Make sure you know EVERYTHING you might possibly wan na know . I have quite a few articles on **29;432;TOOLONG which you might find useful good luck with your first assignment = <p> I visited for the first time last month also and was n't impressed at all by the city . Though it kept its european charm and architecture , the people are quite standoffish and everything is expensive . The gypsy beggars were the most surprising thing about the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people standoffish ! I actually thought they were quite nice , but I 'm used to Scandinavians being pretty reserved . I did n't  see any gypsy beggars at all wondering if they were waiting out the snowstorm somewhere ? ! <p> I just LOVE that you included a photo of Meatballs- For the People ! I just got back from there this weekend and had the BEST meal from my whole trip there . Awesome post , and almost all of those surprised me as well ! <p> Dani , like you I love Stockholm , especially Gamla Stan . I visited in early spring when the warmth was just returning to the city and the water under the bridges were already melted . Reason #8 is definitely up there the city is even more fairytale-like under the snow ! Gorgeous ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143151 @2543151/ <p> We have been road tripping for nearly a week now and at first this trip was about hitting the open road and just taking in whatever New Mexico had to offer , but the highlights have been non-stop making it hard to choose a favorite for this weeks Polaroid . Forced to choose , then I say nothing was as spectacular as driving through the White Sands sand dunes in the southwest of New Mexico . We spent half a day in the 275 square mile ( 712 square km ) field of white sand . You can sled down the dunes , which from far away looks like people in shorts sledding down snowy hills , but in 100 degree heat . The strange feeling of snow is also there when driving at some point the road stops and you drive around on compacted white sand , expecting the slippery ice patches that never come . Its all very surreal and even more so driving our white rental car through even whiter dunes . At first we were reminded of the miles and miles of salt flats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so you could see straight for miles . Here , walking just a few hundred feet into the dunes meant you could get entirely turned around and climb up and down hundreds of sand dunes before ever finding your way back . <p> We set off on a well-marked 4.2 mile hike right through the dunes and were seriously humbled by the silence surrounding us . We had to turn around after 1.25 miles as it was too hot . Hiking at noon in the desert is probably not the best time , even if all that white reflects some of the sun ! If we had it to do over again we might go for sunset instead . Imagine the colors of the desert sky reflecting off those dunes <p> Follow along on Facebook with our Photo of the Day , or at #2girls1chevy on Twitter and Instagram , where we 've got photos and videos of the fun little things that make the essence of a great road trip ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

After all , the former East German First Lady Margot Honecker resides in Santiago , but just how German ' would the Lake District be ? - Would there be blond-haired , blue-eyed children running around everywhere , and women in traditional German outfits serving big frothy steins of Hefeweizen in rustic wooden cabins ? I never realized that chocolate and cake were something so typical for Germany , but we heard that there would be lots of exactly these two things . Since I have n't been to Germany in almost two years , I was excited for this sweet little slice of home ' in Chile . <p> German Style House Frutillar <p> Our first stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found described on Wikipedia as a historical treasure of strong German features , with houses that have been declared cultural heritage , including the Sacred Heart Church , the Kuschel House , the German House , the Schwerter House and the Niklitschek House . <p> The Deutscher Verein ( German Club ) in Puerto Varas <p> As soon as we arrived , I could feel the German-ness of the town all around me . I first noticed that the small wooden cabin type houses similar to those found in Bavaria were mixed in with the cement block structures typical in Chile . Puerto Varas is also situated on a lake , which actually reminded me of the Wolfgangsee in Austria , and to me , Puerto Varas resembles St Gilgen , a little village on that lake . <p> Kunstmann : German-style Chilean beer <p> Germans have been living in this part of Chile since the mid-19th century when the Chilean government killed two birds with one stone by inviting over my ancestors , who were undergoing a fairly serious revolution at the time , and handing out free land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for german food in Valdivia <p> We never learned about this mass exodus at school , but between 30,000 and 40,000 Germans settled in Chile at the time , crossing the ocean for weeks heading toward an unknown future . <p> Although today there is less blonde hair and only very few hints of German remaining in the language , German names of the original settlers can be found on plaques on the city 's grand buildings and on gravestones in the city cemetery : Beck , Bittner , Hoffmann , Gebauer , Klenner , Kuschel , L++ckeheide , Minte , Mittesteiner , M++ller , Nettig , Schminke , Schwabe , Schwalz , Strauch , Tampe , Vyhmeister , Von Bischoffshausen , among others . <p> Still , I was not entirely satisfied , partially because of wild expectations I had after reading an article by this Chicago Tribune journalist who came here 25 years ago still found places like Fritschs hardware , the Shulz grocery , the Holck bakery , the Roller restaurant , the Gutenberg bookstore , Vyhmeisters supermarket and Herr Streichholzs unisex salon , which all seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in Frutillar <p> Our hostel owner told us all about a nearby town called Fruitillar , which is smaller and even more German ' than Puerto Varas , he assured us . <p> Puppenhaus ( the Doll House ) Frutillar <p> Though fairly lackluster , Frutillar truly could have been a town in Southern Germany . The main street , set on a beautiful volcanic lake , is completely lined with the wooden type of houses you find in many villages in Bavaria and lots of signs in German advertising the Frau Holle Hotel ' ( Mother Holle , a famous figure from a Brother Grimm fairytale ) , das Puppenhaus ( Doll House ) or das Kuchenhaus ( Cake House ) . <p> I marveled at the kuchenes ( Chileans have added their own plural es ' to the German word , very cute ) that all looked as if my grandma herself had made them . There is even a German Colonial museum with buildings furniture and machinery dating back to the second and third generation immigrants who quickly opened crop fields and incorporated and established their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style houses and clocks in Chile <p> Even though the village is tiny , it makes for an enjoyable half-day trip , which consists entirely of coffee and kuchen . You could easily be transported from Chile to Germany , unless you look across Lake Llanquihue , where volcano Osorno sits , which would remind you that you are nowhere near Germany . Sadly the weather did n't cooperate during our visit and we did n't even see the base of this volcano ourselves . <p> Fondue and Cake in Chile <p> A few days later , we were on the way over to Bariloche , Argentina , just a quick five-hour drive up and over the Andes mountains , wondering if as many Germans had settled in Argentina 's part of the Lake District . Would there still be cake ? Would be able to still go for our afternoon coffee and kuchen , which had become a daily habit by then ? <p> We quickly learned that the Germans had been just as fond of the Argentinean side of the Lake District as the Chilean side . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't surprise me that German emigrants felt at home in the region. - Before we even saw any signs of Kuchen though , we spotted the tower of the neogothic church jutting out from skyline of the city " a church that could be found anywhere in Germany . However , a second wave of immigration in Bariloche 's history is a bit darker than in Chile . Many of the Germans who headed here were escaping prison sentences in Germany , or worse . Several Nazi leaders fled Germany for Bariloche after World War II , avoiding the war trials happening in post-war Germany . They seem to have escaped their reputations for the most part , here in Bariloche . Erich Priebke , one of Hitler 's captains , who was responsible for the mass execution of 335 Italians in 1944 , became the respected director of the German School of Bariloche and living as a free man in Argentina for fifty years until he finally was extradited in 1990 . <p> Fire truck in German in Valdivia , Chile <p> Today , Bariloche felt just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Chile , with several German-style breweries and brewery tours , so much kuchen ( though Argentines use the Spanish words for this ) and most notably , chocolate .

Although I have no idea of the final count on how many pieces of cake I managed to eat in the Lake District , let 's just say I am certain that I made up for the two years since I have been in Germany ! <p> Chocolates for sale in Frutillar <p> Beer , chocolate and cake are some of my country 's great exports , but overall I felt like the German influence here was a bit superficial and overhyped . I was expecting our famous breads , not the many varieties of white , processed rolls , and where were the savory dishes like Spaetzle or Bratwurst ?

I was kinda aware that there were Germans in the southern part of South America , but not anything like what you have discovered . This destination has now been moved way up on the list of future trips as I also can relate to everything German . <p> I 'm second generation German/American , as my fathers side immigrated from Northern Germany and my mothers side immigrated from the Ukraine ( German farmers ) . My mother only spoke German until the age of ten , living on a farm in South Dakota . Half the town I grew up in , in Lodi California , was German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have even fixed Spaetzle a few times and love Schnitzel . My grandma and mom used to bake Kuchen all the time . I cook , but I do n't  bake so I have to rely on my aunts for my Kuchen fix . The Kuchen I 'm familiar with is more of a custard pie with fruit . Just like the Borscht my mom made was more of a vegetable soup , without beets . As time passes , I suspect that passed down recipes get lost in translation . <p> At any rate , I liked this post and look forward to visiting that part of the world . I 've already crisscrossed Germany ( the mother land ) several times and feel really at home there , even though I cant speak very much German . <p> Hi Steve , I did n't  know you were 2nd generation German-American ! Has your mom taught you German when you were a kid ? The kuchen you mention ( custard pie with fruit ) is actually a really popular homemade cake in Germany = <p> I have NO IDEA there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clue about Italian immigrants in Buenos Aires . Glad to know you got a little taste of home , though ! The cuckoo clock reminds me of the one my grandfather had ! <p> Pauline I only knew very little about that , when we got to Chile . Seeing German firetrucks and kuchen and all that was so surprising ! The cuckoo clocks are such an old-fashioned German thing , I do n't  think my generation still has them in their houses at least no one I know = <p> Now that I think about it I would almost say that the region reminded me even more of the Upper Austrian lake district than Germany ! Some parts of Southern Germany look like the places in Chiles lake district , but I think overall it resembles Austria a bit more ? ! <p> Really interesting post . If you 're interested in seeing more of these German communities on your trip through South America , you should put Oxapampa on your list when you travel through Peru . Its located in the Amazonas region of the country and is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January and February in Puerto Varas and felt quite at home . <p> As to the stuff you were missing : In the Jumbo supermarket in Puerto Varas , you can find a variety of real German bread made of sourdough and Bratwurst , too . In Puerto Montt , there 's a huge German Aisle in the Jumbo supermarket . You can get everything German from Schwartau Extra to Erdinger Wei+bier . <p> Did you try a " Completo Dinamico " ? Its with Sauerkraut and if you 're lucky , you can even get it in Santiago . <p> Florian , you are right about the Jumbo ! I should have at least mentioned it but we were so used to them from Santiago by the time we got to the Lake District .

My German ancestors ( brother and sister ) were born in Valdivia 1872 and 3 . The family returned to Germany where they stayed only a few years , then immigrated to Australia .

I was surprised to see so many German last names ! also a few Italian , British and French last names . <p> The German descendants were very Patriotic and hardworking like most of us European descendants , our fathers and mothers wrought us up in a strict code I would say 1/3 of the Academy was made of this type of kids.it was a bit stunning that our marches were German mostly , our uniforms were Royal Air Force ( 1930 was Chilean Air foundation year heavily influenced by the RAF ) but all the military ways were German , the salute , the attention position and.we were VERY happy with that my two sons Giancarlo and Christian went trough this Academy , and now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this academy its said " to be Prussian !

In cultural terms they are not very different , partly because of their chilean identity , and partly because some german elements were also incorporated in the chilean southern society , especially food ( as kuchen , strudel , berliner , sausages and raw meat " crudos " ) . For example , mi family is completely chilean , but our traditional dessert is the **31;463;TOOLONG kuchen = <p> By the way In southern Chile we normally talk about " the germans " , but actually many of them were ethnic germans from Czech Republic , Austria , Switzerland or even Netherlands . As the immigration was before of the unification of Germany , for the chileans they were all " germans " . An example of this is the town of " Nueva Braunau " , named after the czech city of Braunau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum ( owned by the Niklitschek family = ) . Some people say that the Province of Llanquihue was populated with germans from Austria , and the Province of Valdivia with germans from Germany , but I 'm not sure about this distinction . <p> I agree that there really is n't much evidence of German culture in Bariloche . What there is is contrived , frankly . Visually , Bariloche could be Banff in Canada , which no one claims is German in cultural flavour . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

These are our top choices to soak up the culture and feel of the German capital . <p> It is by no means final. - <p> In this part of our 4-part Berlin Quick Guides , we are sharing our favorite parks , flea markets , lakes and other outdoor activities . While some of these things ( markets , parks ) can be visited year-round , it is mainly a summer guide . We have to admit that we think that Berlin is best visited in the summer , when you can enjoy all the outdoor things that make this city so amazing . <h> Berlin in the summer <p> We have to say that Berlin is most enjoyable in the summer when it is hot and the whole city is outside . During the warmer months , cafes and restaurants put tables out on the sidewalks , the parks are filled with picnicking friends , beach bars pop up along the River Spree , the Badeschiff is open , karaoke takes place in the Mauerpark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets . Thus , we recommend to visit Berlin anytime between May and September , to get the full experience of what Berlin has to offer . All the following are things that you should n't miss in Berlin in the summer : <h> Beach Bars <p> There are a number of beach bars that open up for the summer months every year along the river , complete with sun chairs and lovely river views . <p> Strandbar Mitte ( Monbijoustra+e 3 ) is small , but the most central beach bar with a nice vibe with sand , sun chairs and even some palm trees . On some nights , there are free tango classes here . <p> Capital Beach near the Reichstag is a bit more expensive , but has great views over the new parliament buildings . <p> Yaam ( Stralauer Platz 35 ) near the Osthafen attracts a more alternative crowd , and is probably the cheapest beach bar <p> Ku'damm Beach is one of the fancier beach bars in Charlottenburg ( Koenigsallee 5b ) <h> Flea Markets <p> The biggest flea market is on Stra+e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Tiergarten ) . Another cool one is on Sundays at Mauerpark ( next to Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg ( Subway : Eberswalder Stra+e ) . Mauerpark has the typical flea market goodies like furniture , antiques , books and vintage clothes , but also a number of good and inexpensive food stalls , so come hungry . Nearby is the flea market at Arkonaplatz , a smaller flea market , held also on Sundays you can actually combine a visit to both . <h> Mauerpark Karaoke <p> Something that you should n't miss if you happen to be in Berlin in the summer is the free karaoke at Mauerpark on Sunday afternoons . Weather permitting , up to 10,000 people show up for it ! No worries you do n't have to sing if you do n't want to , but it is great fun to watch it , and you can combine it with a visit to the Mauerpark flea market . <h> Badeschiff <p> The Badeschiff ( Eichenstra+e 4 ) is a unique outdoor swimming pool in the Spree River . It is basically a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small beach area attached . The Badeschiff is super popular on hot summer days though , but avoid weekends when you 'll have to stand in line for hours just to get in the pool . We went on a weekday around noon and there was already a huge line , but it was worth the wait . - Admission is G5 for the day and food and drinks , both alcoholic and non-alcoholic , are available for purchase inside but they are way overpriced . Unfortunately , cameras and food/drinks ca n't be brought inside . <p> Berlin 's oldest park is popular with the hipster crowd of Friedrichshain as well as big Turkish families who spend their Sundays barbequing at the Kleiner Bunkerberg , the area of the park where grilling is allowed . The gorgeous Fairytale Fountain is well worth a visit , even if you 're not that into fairytales . <p> Treptower Park <p> Treptower Park stretches over four kilometers along the River Spree , and is filled with sunbathers during the summer months . The Haus Zenner is a large beer garden with views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several places where you can rent pedal or rowing boats . <p> The Tempelhofer Freiheit is a huge green space on what was Tempelhof Airport , Berlin 's main airport until 2008 . Since then , it has been transformed into a community park , much of it left in its original state , with added community gardens , barbeque areas and an artsy mini golf facility . It 's a great place to hang out for a picnic , just read a book , or stay for sunset , but it 's HUGE " just walking across the landing strip takes at least half an hour , so we 'd also recommend exploring it by bike . <h> The lakes <p> Berlin is known for its dozens of lakes just outside the city , and it seems that in the summer months , everybody escapes the heat of the capital and rushes to one of the many lakes . Some are harder to get to without a car , some easier , but a Saturday at the lake is a quintessential Berlin experience . Just pick one and head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get crowded on weekends . <p> Wannsee <p> Wannsee is the most popular lake around Berlin , and since it is connected to the city via S-Bahn , it gets really busy . Up to 30,000 people at once can be accommodated here " Wannsee offers the largest swimming area at a lake in all of Europe ! The beach has beach chairs , beach volleyball fields , and water slides for kids , you can rent boats , there are restaurants and cafes , and a nudist area . <p> How to get there : Take the S-1 to Potsdam and get out at Wannsee . <p> Tegeler See <p> Lake Tegel is the second largest lake in Berlin and often named as the most beautiful one . There are seven islands and it is a great lake for sailing , boating or taking a steamboat ride . There are smaller beaches along the west side of the lake , some restaurants and trails through the surrounding forests . The Greenwich Promenade is lined with places to eat and benches to take in the scenery . <p> How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at either Alt-Tegel or Borsigwerke . <p> Schlachtensee <p> Schlachtensee is apparently the cleanest of Berlin 's lakes , and you 'll see lots of fishermen out on little boats or in the woods that line the shores of this beautiful lake . You can actually walk around the lake on a 7km ( 4.3miles ) boardwalk , making it a perfect destination for a long walk until you find the perfect spot to soak up the sun . The Fischerh++tte Am Schlachtensee is a historical guest house with beer garden where you can relax after a long stroll , or rent a boat to spend time on the lake . <p> How to get there : Take the S-1 to Potsdam and get out at Schlachtensee . <p> M++ggelsee <p> M++ggelsee is the largest lake near Berlin , and is basically East Berlin 's counterpart to the Wannsee . You can hike here , rent boats or canoes , sunbathe or enjoy the nudist area . If you make your way to M++ggelsee , you might want to combine it with the quaint former fishing village of Rahnsdorf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred-year old houses and a muscle-powered ferry you can take a cross the lake . <p> How to get there : Take the S-3 to Erkner and get off at Friedrichshagen or Rahnsdorf . <h> Have something to add ? <p> This is our ever-growing list of our personal Berlin favorites , and we would love to add your own comments or advice to this list !

@@107143155 @2543155/ <h> Ottawa UnLOCKed : Finding the key to conquering Canada 's Capital City <p> Canadas capital city is clean , green , and home to some of the worlds friendliest citizens , so it is easy to feel immediately at ease here . However , the key to truly conquering Ottawa is all about the locksKeep Out : Constructing the Canal <p> While Ottawa is more than welcoming now , the city has n't  always been that way. - Nearly 200 years ago , a British colonel , Colonel By , was sent over and put to the task of protecting Canada from its pesky American neighbors , rumored to be planning an invasion of Canadian territory by way of the St Lawrence Seaway . It turns out that while we made our way through the city this summer , I would n't have been the first American attempting to conquer this area of Ontario . <p> It was Colonel Bys task to construct the Rideau Canal , which , in bypassing the St Lawrence River bordering New York , would secure the supply and communications route between Montreal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the Ottawa River to Bytown ( named for Colonel By , this was originally a makeshift town in the swampy wilderness . Its known today as Ottawa ) and then continuing southwest via the canal to Kingston before emptying into Lake Ontario . <p> Today , these eight mighty locks are a perfect starting off point for exploring Ottawa . Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site , Locks 1-8 lower the waters of the Rideau Canal to meet the Ottawa River 30 feet below . Both the majestic Parliament Hill and magnificent Fairmont Chateau Laurier castle hotel rise high above the Rideau to give this part of Ottawa an entirely old-world feel . Strolling along the path by the locks here is relaxing , and the Bytown Museum ( can you guess its namesake ? ) is a great little spot to learn more about the building of this engineering marvel . <h> Cycling in Ottawa <p> Looking to cover more ground , we headed to Rentabike , not 50m from the museum along the canal . After stocking up on heaps of great advice from the owner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . First we shot up the canal away from the river , past the paddle boats on Dows Lake , and stopped at the sound of pounding water the waterfalls of Hogs Back . <p> Ottawa is a cycling city and thousands of Ottawans ( very courteously , of course ) commute back and forth from work as much as to enjoy the outdoors . In fact , Ottawa has over 200 kilometers of bike paths , we had been told , but in our six hours out on the bikes , we only managed 30 km . <h> Beaver Tails and Boats <p> Before bringing the bikes back , it was time for a late lunch at the Byward Market . Established by Colonel By in 1826 , this is Canadas oldest public market , covering nearly four square blocks of restaurants , pubs and some incredible specialty food shops . After lunch we popped in to a cheese shop so specialized , it even carries our favorite brand of Norwegian cheese ! In an amazing case of self-restraint , however , we walked out empty handed but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Beaver Tail stand . <p> Beaver Tails are Ottawas classic deep-fried , doughy delights and are best enjoyed in Winter with a hot cup of coffee to warm up . You might be enjoying a break from ice-skating along one of the worlds longest ice rinks . Stretching seven kilometers from the Ottawa river , the frozen length of the Rideau Canal converts Ottawa into a winter wonderland and when it re-opens in mid-May , several boats pass through the locks each day , some heading down to the Ottawa River . While one hundred years ago , the river would have been packed with thousands of logs rushing down it as a part of the logging industry , today this aquatic hotspot is packed with speed boats , kayaks , yachts and even white water enthusiasts " although that takes place up the river about 90 minutes from downtown . <p> We wanted to get out on the river , but also wanted to do a city tour Lady Dive amphibus tour met both those needs . In its bus form , we tooled through town on four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . We then plunged into the water next to the Britannia Yacht Club and , as soon as we got our sea legs , we floated past the Museum of Civilization , a mega-museum which takes visitors through 1,000 years of Canadian history and also has a childrens museum and a 3D IMAX theater . Make sure to plan at least one day here , if not two . <p> Also set on the river is the National Gallery , considered Canadas premiere art museum . We really enjoyed the permanent exhibits , which are on par with top international galleries . True culture vultures might want to plan in at least half a day to visit , though any travelers on a budget should visit on Thursdays , when entrance to the National Gallery is free from 5-8pm. - Ottawa has plenty of public art as well , from the statue of Canadian blues legend Oscar Peterson ( at the corner of Elgin and Albert ) to the many statues located on top of Parliament Hill : The Women are persons ! sculpture and the Queen Elizabeth II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After the river cruise , we sprinted up to Parliament Hill for a look at these statues and to take part in the free guided tour of the Parliament buildings Centre Block ( daily , more frequent in summer ) . This tour was the best to help us grasp the political history of the nation as a whole . <h> Just over the Ottawa River <p> While out on the Ottawa River , it was not immediately clear that we were floating along a heavily-contested , well-protected border . There are no border control guards and we did n't  need our passports . We did n't  even leave the city . <p> But , as we learned on the Parliament tour , the Ottawa River is where English and French-speaking Canada converge , and this border , a sociocultural one , is fervently protected on either side . This fact is not obvious to casual visitors except for strict language difference on either side of the river . We had overheard snippets of French throughout our time in Ottawa , but our day trip over the bridge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order lunch in some pretty rusty French . Luckily most of our day hike through the gorgeously green Gatineau required very few words at all . <h> Ride along the Rideau Canal <p> Both sides of Ottawa boast such fresh , green space , as do the 202km along the Rideau Canal . These calm waters can be explored by boat , which takes up to seven days to make it through all 49 locks along the Rideau Canal to Kingston on the St Lawrence River . During our time in Ottawa , we chose to cycle and drive most of the way , meandering along country back roads and through picture perfect towns like- Merrickville and Perth . There is also a trail for hikers , bikers and cross-country skiers . <p> No matter how you choose to explore Ottawa , whether by boat , bike , car or kayak , the key to discovering the citys heart begins along the citys locks . <p> I grew up in Ottawa and remember the city mostly for great cycling , the Byward Market and the proximity to the Gatineau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in over 20 years after Christmas hoping for a frozen canal and looking forward to rediscovering the city . <p> Oh , you will have such a good time , Leigh ! We heard so many good things about Ottawa in the winter , when the canals are frozen and people are ice skating everywhere ! We highly recommend the free tour of the Parliament a good place to go to warm up should it get too cold = <p> This is so much information , I hope I get to go to Ottawa someday and use it . The bike riding sounds lovely . I am not a mountain biker but I love cruiser bikes for leisurely sight seeing . That rock art photo is awesome ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107143158 @2543158/ <h> Irresistible Brighton : What makes Brighton so appealing ? <p> The first time I heard about Brighton , the popular seaside town on Englands south coast , was in a Sherlock Holmes crime novel I read as a young adult , which was set in 19th century Brighton . The book did not only talk about a murder case Holmes solved , but it also mentioned posh women in fancy , flowing dressed who were meandering up and down the extensive promenade , hands in white gloves that were holding an ornate umbrella , it vividly described elegant Regency-style buildings with stuccoed facades and column-framed entrance doors . When I finally visited Brighton , many years later , that was the image I had in my head.As soon as we arrived at the beach promenade , I could immediately picture Brighton in its heyday as posh weekend getaway for Londons elite and royals . It still had the flair of this elegant seaside town with gorgeous , well-maintained Georgian-style- houses facing the ocean , the stunning Royal Pavilion , and the old fashioned pier . - <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that the town is anything but stuck in time , having developed into its very own modern version of an English seaside resort , a town that is completely different than all the other seaside resorts on Englands south coast , with its very distinctive , incomparable character that sets it apart from cities like Portsmouth and Southampton . So what makes Brighton so unique ? Alternative &amp; creative minds <p> A big reason that Brighton is- so different from other seaside town are its people . Brighton is known to be a town that attracts people with alternative lifestyle : Vegetarians , gay and lesbians , artists , hippies , you name it .. You 'll find them in Brighton . Creative minds ? Artsy , liberal and open-minded ? That 's what Brightonians are . The eclectic mix of interesting people and alternative lifestyles gives the town a distinct character . Brighton is also known for an overall less money-driven and laid-back lifestyle ( synonym ! ) than nearby London , for example . The vibe here is relaxed , stress-free and there is an ever-present feel of vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aforementioned alternative lifestyles with those , you automatically get a more interesting city than your standard picket fence prefab home community . Brighton comes in bright colors , with street art , giant murals and coffee shops and restaurants that are n't  your regular chain ( even though I cant deny that all of Britains typical high-street chains are also present in Brighton ) . Which other town in England has a vegetarian shoe store and a vegetarian pub , vegetarian Sunday roast inclusive ? Treasures in the Lanes and North Laine <p> Brighton has two kinds of lanes that are not to be confused : The Lanes , a maze of little alleys , which are quite unique . These are located close to the beach , just west of the pier . Turn into any of the little streets that lead away from the beach and you 're already in the Lanes , which are lined with little shops , cafes , pubs and restaurants , inviting to stroll , window shop or stop somewhere for a coffee . Or a pint , of course . No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about individuality instead of following the mainstream . Just step inside The Marwood coffee shop and have a look around and you 'll know what I mean ( you should stop there anyway for their self-proclaimed kick-arse coffee and life-changing cake ) . And then there is North Laine , another paradise for treasure hunters , filled with jewelry shops , antique stores and anything in between . Vintage clothes , records , unusual souvenirs , delicious food and vegetarian shoes ? You 'll find it all here . This is also where you find Komedia , a fantastic entertainment venue where you can catch a comedy , cabaret or music show while enjoying great food.The glorious beach <p> Of course the beach plays- a big part in- what makes Brighton so irresistible . Miles and miles of beach just a- short- walk from the town center not many cities are blessed with such a prime location . And even though Brightons beaches do n't  have sand , but pebble stones , it repeatedly makes its way into lists of world famous beach towns . One thing that gets me wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are things like the quaint , wooden- beach chairs , the little- oyster shacks and charming gift shops that are housed in what used to be homes for fishing boats.Brighton is colorful <p> Those of you who 've been following me for a while know how much I love street art , and Brighton just so happens to be a paradise for street art lovers . You do n't even have to look for it " just walk down the streets and you 'll notice colorfully painted walls in narrow alleys , stencil art on walls , and entire buildings covered in stunning murals . But it 's not only street art that makes Brighton colorful " people here are not afraid to paint their houses purple , blue or pink , instead of the same-same white houses you have in most cities.A historical gem : The Royal Pavilion <p> The Royal Pavilion is undoubtedly Brighton 's best known landmark , built by Prince Regent ( he was later crowned King George IV ) in the early 19th century . The impressive building does not look British at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it stand out even more . You ca n't miss the giant domes and minarets , and upon getting closer , the ornate columns and well-maintained gardens- that surround the Pavilion . If you are a history buff , you do n't want to miss the inside which is still filled with the Regency-era furniture and Chinese decorations like an extravagant dragon chandelier in the dining room.Cheesy but charming : Brighton Pier <p> Brighton used to have not one but two piers " that was until the West Pier was destroyed by a fire . The iron and wooden skeleton of it still sits in the water , slowly deteriorating . I 've noticed that the remaining parts of it have gotten smaller since I first visited Brighton in 2005 , but the West Pier still draws a lot of people every day " it makes a great backdrop for Brighton 's stunning sunsets.The other pier , Brighton Pier , is still up and running , including its- antiquated games arcade which is always teeming with people , and a small amusement park at the very end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other thrill rides . Even though some might call it cheesy , it is one of the last remaining 19th century piers of such size in the country . I personally love walking along the wooden boardwalk , grabbing a bag of freshly fried , still warm- doughnuts and enjoying them in one of the deck chairs while looking out over the ocean and Brighton 's beaches , the ever present crying seagulls hovering above me ( be careful when you grab a bag of fish and chips " these seagulls are not afraid to come down and grab food right out of- our hands ! ) . <p> A fantastic culinary scene <p> Brighton has an amazing- culinary scene that goes way beyond British pubs and the same ol chain restaurants I know from other cities in the UK . Not only does Brighton have a great selection of vegetarian restaurants , but you can also indulge in heavenly baked goods in one of the many bakeries and coffee shops ( trust me , I do n't  think there was a day when I did n't  treat myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or afternoon tea ! ) , enjoy a variety of ethnic cuisine , fresh and organic food , and there are high-end fine dining eateries for a special occasion ( like the Restaurant at Drakes , the- award-winning- vegetarian restaurant Terre A Terre or 64 Degrees ) . The diverse and scrumptious- culinary scene is something that makes Brighton stand out , and some of the restaurants that I recommend you check out are : Egg &amp; Spoon , the Artisan Deli &amp; Coffee House , Metro Deco for afternoon tea , St James Pub , Bills , the Redroaster Coffee Shop , the Basketmakers Arms Pub , Fishy Fishy for seafood and Riddle &amp; Finns for champagne &amp; oysters , Wai Kika Mu Kau and Food For Friends for vegetarian and vegan food ( the latter is more upscale , the former casual ) , Pelicano House and The Marwood for coffee &amp; cake , Sabai Thai and Muang Thai for Thai food , That Little Tea Shop In The Lanes for cake and tea , Angel Food Bakery for cupcakes . <h> Tips for visiting Brighton <p> Brighton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making it a perfect day trip destination . Tickets , if bought in advance , can be found for as little as -5 via TheTrainline.com I myself was able to snatch one of these discount tickets when I visited Brighton last month , in the middle of summer high season.Even though a day trip is tempting , I recommend taking more time to enjoy Brightons nightlife and to have enough time to explore the town as well as fit in some relaxing beach time . If you decided to spend a night ( or two there are enough day trips from Brighton to make a longer visit worthwhile ) I highly recommend the new YHA hostel which is located smack dab in the middle of all the action and a minute from the beach for budget travelers , and the funky and gay-friendly B&amp;B Snooze in the Kemp Town neighborhood if you feel like splurging on something out of the ordinary.For more information , accommodation recommendations and events in Brighton , check out VisitBrighton.com. 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Just in case you 're thinking about a trip closer to ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after spending two months in the Philippines which , as you know , is the most unfriendly country for vegetarians .

@@107143162 @2543162/ <h> Polaroid of the week : Adobe home in Santa Fe , New Mexico <p> One thing we could n't get enough of in New Mexico were the gorgeous adobe homes , especially around Santa Fe , Albuquerque and Taos . Adobe is made of just sand , water , clay and straw , and yet some of these homes and buildings are easily over 400 years old , which is why architects often consider the homes as architectural miracles . This form of construction has been used for several thousand years by people indigenous to the Americas , including the native American Indians that inhabited the pueblos around new Mexico and the Southwest . <p> Aesthetically , adobe homes are really the symbol of the Southwest , the earth tones fitting perfectly into the desert scenery and punctuated by bright colorful flowers , vases , tiles and window frames . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143163 @2543163/ <h> How to upset an entire nation : Why Chileans Think We SUCK ! <p> The way to someone 's heart is through their stomach , and the way to upset an entire nation , at least the nation of Chile , is to criticize its cuisine . <p> I know this , because a post we wrote called Here 's Why Chilean Food Sucks which caused a massive stir . On our own site it went relatively unnoticed , but after it was picked up in South American food blog called Comosur it then gained traction , began spreading on social media and has now gone fairly viral . <p> Of course , I never , ever meant to offend the great people of Chile . Even the ones who have told me now to drink bleach , eat shit and die and never come back to the country because we are fat , gringa , lesbian sluts ( note : possible future band name ? ) . - Below we have listed some of the comments , just a sprinkling of the hundreds of mixed results some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , you will find the Lessons I have Learned from this experience with infamy . <p> First , a few words to the thousands of Chileans visiting our site : <p> To the people of Chile , I would like to emphasize a few things : <p> 1 . We adore Chile please see the list of posts below . There are LOT of positive posts about Chile on this website. 2 . I know that you are a country , not a condiment , and it was simply a ( very , very bad ) play on words the Chile vs Chili comment . 3 . This is a website for all travelers , not just Chileans , and while I thank you for inviting us to come to your home to eat the homemade Chilean food , what we find out in restaurants throughout the country is very different . 4 . Why does food have to be expensive to be good ? Many people have argued that we were eating inexpensive ' food and that a decent meal comes at certain price . We agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you travel full time , as we do , you can not eat expensive meals all the time . And unlike so many other countries around the world , when you go under $10 a plate , the food in Chile becomesless desirable , when in other countries around the world , even simple meals can be seriously delicious . It is an issue of value for money . 5 . Dani is German , so please stop calling her a fat American . 6 . Let me as the big , stupid American take the fall . I understand what it is like to have people constantly beat up on your country . I lived abroad during all 8 of the Bush years and faced extreme hatred day in and day out . It is very easy to call us stupid Americans and that we know nothing . 7 . You eat pizza , Chile . For all the people that got so down on me for writing about the pizza it is everywhere in your country . It may not make the list of your national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is on menus all around the country . Therefore , whether you like it or not , it is one of the foods that people come across when visiting your country . 8 . We are vegetarian , so please stop telling us that we left out the meat dishes and seafood dishes . We know . And the people who read our site more than just for this one article , they all know that . 9 . While I admit that I should n't have used the word sucks ' , we are never going to love your food . Sorry . 10 . We did not only eat in fast food places . In 100 days it would have been impossible to list all the places we ate . But as a tourist , without a home or a grandmother to cook you Chilean food , you often eat on the go . And even the local places that you claim we did not eat in ( which we very often did ) have the kinds of food we mention in the article . 11 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point we were making . 12 . We actually did eat in almost all the restaurants that have been recommended to us , we shopped every week at the La Vega Mercado during our time in Santiago . It is a lovely market . For tourists reading this , you really should go there . 13 . We love your produce . It 's amazing . It 's fresh , better than so many other places . 14 . We did not travel Chile with a guide ' . We had at least 20+guides on the various tours we did , we used Foursquare where local Chileans recommend restaurants in each town , we use travel blogs , local blogs , guidebooks , forums , talk to locals and get recommendations . So , there is no guide ' you can blame for not showing us the best Chile has to offer . 15 . When people travel , they often make comparisons . To compare the empanadas of various countries is natural , just as comparing public transportation systems , quality of roads , the beautiful landscapes ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other South American country ) . <p> Now , on to some of the comments : - <p> Fran told us to get the sand out of our vaginas. - <p> Julio , Rita and Jules insinuate that we are alcoholics who only go out at night and eat when we are wasted . I do not drink alcohol and Dani does only very rarely . <p> Valerii encourages us ( for those who read Spanish ) to watch the movie The- Breakfast Club to get a real sense of what a shitty culture we Americans come from , using this as evidence as to why we should never , ever come back to Chile as we have humiliated the entire country . <p> Alejandra says:I 've heard from travel writers that you have to write about the positive things you find while traveling . But I do understand your frustration regarding food in Chile. - I have been living in Chile for 3 years and I truly remember finding everything terribly tasteless for 8 months ( more than 100 days . ) After that time , I was eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I happened to comment how nice was the food and she laughed and said really ? You have lost your sense of taste . <p> No offense Chileans , but your food ( and I DO NT EVER eat street vendors food ) is tasteless and overpriced . Although I have looked over and over again for cheese I have not found a good Chilean cheese . I ( trust me ) bought almost every cheese and they are flavorless . I support your article 100% I live there and I think that Chilean cuisine is far from being world-class or even nice . I think that Chileans lack the ability to see what 's not working so well within their borders and that , also applies to food . <p> The Alejandra followed up with:I also have to say that it is a SHAME that Chileans think that you have spend a lot of money to eat properly . This is just a reflection of their classicist culture " only the ones with money are allowed to eat nicely , live comfortably and be well educated " . Normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is not as " rich " as Chile is ) street food is the best . - <p> Diego and hundreds of others have told us not to come back anymore:Girls , you really do n't  taste THE REAL Chilean food ! REALLY ? and even after that , you made a bad opinion about the food ! - All the food that you mentioned in this blog , here in Chile is almost like a snacksyou come to Chile to eat pizza ? really ? is like if i go to Italy to eat Ceviche , its ridiculous is n't ? - And if you do n't  like the sea food , ( maybe the principal culinary attraction in Chile ) , do n't  come back anymore <p> Gerardo would like to rock us in the bedroom:Seems that your loco guides were not the best ( and of course you did not try aji cacho de cabra , they say that is double spicy , when you eat it and when you are in the bathroom , lol . Did you even tried sex at least ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luv ya. - <p> A few people said things like:Fuck you Gringoo ! ! ! **25;496;TOOLONG <p> Robert says:Jess , - I think the main mistake you are doing here is not to recognize that your blog post is offensive to Chileans with that excessively harsh title . You cant ask for respect when you are offending people on their pride and for free . So yeah people will be violent on the comments. - <p> Chilean Chef says:You are so wrong . Dis you ever tried CAZUELA or MOTE con HUESILLO ? . So you do n't  even started with te chilean food . Take care with your comments , be sincerely . By th way , The USA food is the worst food that i ever tried , you put bbq sauce y everything , and that is disgusting . <p> An expat living in Chile named Ori confirmed our opinion:Thank you for this post . As a foreign living in Chile , the food has been by far the most traumatic and shocking thing ive had to live with . I remember that I had a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bacon . Poor me , its been 4 years since I 've arrived and Ive never seen that kind of breakfast here . Nevermind the haters . Chileans tend to believe that they are the best of the better of the best ( I 'm not intending to sound redundant ) . They like things heavily salted , flavorless and most of all oily , fatty and simple . They charge you 7000 CLP for a salad that they don-t even bother to stir it up ! ! - <p> Karen 's comment was refreshing:First of all , if you are some stupid lesbians who tried to eat vegetarian food its going to end bad . You have no power here to say our food is terrible because you do n't  even eat meat ! ! So fuck yourselves with a soybean-burger and freeze to death in the USA with your junk food ! ! <p> Locals like J. were nice and agreed to disagree with us on some things : <p> It is true that good food in Chile is really hard to find . We pride ourselves of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat them at home , cause the cheap places that you can afford while backpacking its truly disappointing . If you compare our food to Peruvian or Argentinian it gets even worst . We barely consider vegetarian an option , much less vegan . And the meat we eat is just bad and tasteless . <p> This person says that she agrees , that unlike neighboring countries , Chilean cuisine is n't all that ( In Spanish only ) . <p> I invite you to look into what the people at +am ( http : //niamsantiago.cl ) are doing for our cuisine , its really great . Even though they do n't  make it very public , they treat international chefs to the wonders and variety of our country and they usually leave loving Chile and talking about it back home . Even the Rocas , from the world known El Celler de Can Rocca , have been here and loved what we had to offer . <p> I really think you got cheated , food-wise , when you came here , and like I said on my comment down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a country that eats mostly meat and seafood . <p> Next time you come to Santiago feel free to contact me and my girlfriend and I 'll try and show how good Chilean food can be . You have my e-mail =Oh and once again , sorry for the assholes commenting here . <p> Three years in Chile said , in Spanish , that we were totally right , the food is plain and boring , be realistic . Whoever thinks that Chile is the ultimate in food should travel the world to understand what great food is out there ( in a nutshell ) . <h> The Lessons Learned <p> There have been many lessons learned from this post ; about the outrage , Chilean pride , our place within the world of the internet , and the debate between journalism and blogging . <p> Lesson #1 : Chileans are a very proud people <p> The truth is , when I wrote the article , I did n't  exactly have the Chilean people in mind . I was venting about our ordeal , our struggles , and those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that the title was entirely insensitive . But WOW ! Chileans are very proud of their food and insulting is like directly insulting their grandmothers cooking and then directly their culture and their country . I did not mean that in any way as we love Chile ( please see lesson #2 below ) . <p> Lesson #2 : Negativity spreads like wildfire. - Negativity spreads like wildfire and compliments hardly stick . For over a year we have done nothing more than compliment Chile . The only post that has ever gone viral was the ONE negative one we wrote . I list for you here all the articles where we talk about how incredible we think Chile is : <p> And yet- this one post- is the only post that has ever gone viral on the site . <p> Lesson #3 : I need to listen to my heart as a writer <p> The third is that I had been listening to too many other people 's opinions about the site without listening to my own heart . Many fans and friends have been saying we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of travel . That 's probably true . And every time we meet readers or online friends in real life , they always tell me that I need to try to be funnier , write in a less serious way . The takeaway : I can show the more nitty gritty details about travel without being offensive . I can ( try ) to be funny without taking the easy joke , like the one about Chile and Chili . <p> Lesson #4 The Ever-Raging Blogger vs Journalist Debate <p> Lastly , I have learned that the conflict between what makes a blogger versus a journalist is still raging . I consider us GlobetrotterGirls to clearly be travel experts ( contrary to the list of awful comments here on this website now ) , and bloggers , travelers and nomads . I 've never thought of this as a journalistic space . <p> As bloggers we are lending a different kind of thread to the fabric of the internet . It is a running thread where we share our personal story , our personal experience , our feelings , our hopes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A journalist covers specific stories in a very different way . That is why when I write a post that I do n't like Chilean food , it is part of an ongoing series of nearly 800 articles that our audience can read to understand the story of our lives and our travels . That does n't mean we do n't research . Anyone who knows us knows the copious notes and intense research we put in to the destinations we choose to visit . Even though I never intended for the infamous Chilean food post to be more than a quick frustration release , we researched Chilean food before arriving in Chile , during our time there and afterward to write each and every article on the country . <p> However , many of the reactions have been how unprofessional we are , how we are terrible journalists , and how lazy we are for writing this news . For us , this was just an opinion piece hence the many lame jokes that really did n't land . <p> While I want this website to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this blogger is taking away is that every single piece is a stand alone item that , when taken out of context , can be taken as news by others . <p> A note to our Loyal Readers <p> To our readers , the loyal ones from the past four years and the new ones who have left really great supportive comments here today , thank you . Thank you for sticking with us and being a part of this journey with us . We have dedicated ourselves to covering destinations around the world with passion , careful research and a love of discovering the world . <p> Rather than get bogged down in this negativity , and I admit to casting the first stone , I ca n't help but think of Ellen Degeneres . While other comedians use cheap jokes and make fun of others to get a laugh , she has dedicated her life to spreading love and compassion through her comedy . Until recently , we had hardly said a bad word about anyone or anything on this website , focusing on the things we love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the crap hotels and things we did n't  like about certain places . <p> The passion for travel and experiencing the world is what drives me every single day to keep writing , and I will do this through positivity , keeping all people and the pride of entire nations in mind . <p> The biggest lesson of all , of course , is that , apparently , - you should really try the seafood in Chile ! - <h> Now , what do you think ? <p> Was the title too harsh ? Should we change the title to Why Chilean Food Sucks For Vegetarians ? Even if we know that so many people agree ? 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 159 Comments <h> Comment navigation <p> I think as vegetarians , you two were always going to find it a bit of a struggle to find really good food in South America . I was a veggie for over 10 years straight and have been on and off most of my life . So I do know what I am talking about . Although there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to in Chile , they tended to be pasta or rice-based dishes , nothing inspiring . Unless you cooked your own food , I cant see how you girls would have really liked the food . We had really lovely meals , including pizza , in Chile , but yes , we did pay a lot for some excellent food and not so much for good food , but we ate meat . Considering we travelled from Argentina , where vegetables were pretty much non-existent , we were in fruit and veg heaven by the time we got to Chile and were ecstatic to have something other than steak . <p> We also noticed that there were loads of hot-dog shops in Santiago and elsewhere ! We never did try a completo , but I could n't get my head around eating one as a meal and I would never do it at home . <p> I would n't say the food in Chile sucked , but I could see how it would for you . Poor choice of words I think and considering how much you enjoyed the country apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try not to let it get you down . All the best ! x <p> I totally agree with you , girls ! A couple years ago I went to Chile as an exchange student ( kind of an Erasmus thing ) and lived there for a year ( the University was in Santiago , but I travelled almost the whole country ) . I have to say that chileans are really nice people , I made a lot of friends there and people where always really nice to me . The country is breathtakingly beautiful ( you girls missed some of my favorite places there the altiplano region around Arica , like Parque Nacional Lauca , Reserva Nacional las VIcu+as and Parque Nacional Volcan isluga , as well as the Carretera Austral it has to be one of the most scenic routes in the world ) . I really enjoyed my time there but , as you girls said , the food just SUCKS ! ! In fact everytime I went to eat in some restaurant I felt homesick , lol ( glad I had a kitchen for myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think I really liked only one : the cazuela de marisco I ate in Valdivia ( I love seafood , so that one was delicious I also liked the machas a la parmesana , I bought so many machas in La Vega during my year in Chile ! ) . The empanadas , humitas , sopaipillas , chorrillana and almost every other dish was tasteless . The food was overpriced and very unhealthy they put a lot of salt and fat in everything ! And they drink too much coca cola ! A lot of my friends never EVER drink water , all they drink is coca cola ! No wonder there are a lot of fat chileans ! ! And for all those people saying that " eating in restaurants is not the same as eating your grandmother or mothers food " , well I actually ate some of my friends mothers food and it SUCKED as well ! ! And for Gerardo , who wrote that chileans rock in bed are you sure you wan na talk about that ? xD <p> I have never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how original they can be in coming up with insults . Get the sand out of your vagina , Eff yourself with a soyburger and freeze to death with junkfood I mean .. Thats gold ! Very creative and funny ! <p> I would n't worry too much . You were voicing your opinion . Maybe the title was too harsh , tough luck . You sometimes cross a line in trying to get a point across . Its a learning process in writing , and as humans we all want to be liked by everyone . Its better to believe in your message , your opinion and story , and be liked by a couple , than to stand for nothing and be liked by everyone . Hugs ! <p> I think a fair title would have been " Why we did not like Chilean food " , as it is your personal experience . Your tittle besides being insulting , implies that that is the absolute truth ( " because I say so , everybody should believe me " ) . You should let other people see/taste/judge for themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad experience with a person from X country and then say " Why people from X place sucks " . I would be making a totally arbitrary generalization . That is what creates prejudices and intolerance , which is something , I imagine , you are totally against . I can see , and I do not know if you realize , that some of the supporters of your article and attackers of the Chilean food , are not only attacking the food . That should tell you that those are probably people from a neighboring country , where they are taught from an early age , to hate Chile . However , they find it totally fine to profit from living there ( so I would not consider those opinions to be for valid reasons ) . The fact that you are vegetarians make culinary choices more limited too . On another note , given that you are from USA and Germany , countries without internationally recognized cuisine ( too much junk food in one country and pork , cabbage and potatoes in the other , I would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike a countrys food , obviously , you are entitled to your opinion , but is not fair to give a categorical judgement based on personal experience . Anybody can be of the opinion that : " the vegetarian diet is insipid and lacking in nutrients " , which does n't  make it true just because that person is a carnivore and would not conceive eating just veggies . <p> I like spicy food myself but I realize that the spice is taking and covering up the real taste of the food . So when I am eating a tomato and I add pepper or another condiment , I am not tasting the tomato anymore . But I know that . Spices , as someone pointed out , where used primarily to preserve food and to mask the odor or taste of decaying food , specially in countries where elevated temperatures can spoil food very quickly . Also , it is an ignorant assumption to think that because the name of the country is Chile , food has to be spicy . The origin of the name has nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having said that , I do not condone the vulgarity directed towards you due to hurt feelings , but I guess its the Chilean impulsiveness . I wish you both have better food experiences in your next travels . <p> What was it that they keep saying about food ? Ah yes , " we are what we eat . " I suppose from a cultural standpoint , if you think the food sucks , it goes without saying that you think that the people suck , too . Not exactly what you planned on doing when you posted your article , I know . <p> All the best to you , girls . By chance , will you be traveling stateside ? Montanas nice and cold this time of the year , but you can always come during spring or summer . Just a thought . <p> Girls , as you already sad : bloggers have their own opinion , its your blog , your website . As simple as that . Apart of that , I find really good your attitude of asking people what they think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do But not everybody have the guts to say what they think . Good trips for you 2 ! ! <p> The entire nation of Kazakhstan got upset at the Borat movie . The entire nation of Slovakia ( my homeland ) got upset by hyperbolic comments John Stewart made on his show to make a completely unrelated point . The viewers of both programs saw through the satire , the entire nations did n't  . Actually , that 's not true . Only the humorless , uninformed individuals within those nations got upset because they took the information out of context . And they just may also have long straight objects stuck up their you-know-whats . <p> I know its hard to be on the receiving end of all the hate but consider the source . <p> You wrote a blog post , which is by definition personal , and in that blog post you informed your readers about a topic ( thanks , I learned a lot before my trip to Chile ) . You took a stand . Hats off to you . More please . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetarian Chileans , I think it would be hard to disagree with you in this article at all . Being a vegetarian sucks in a carnivorous country , that 's just the way it goes . My experience with " vegetarian " food in Chile has been that it is not a cuisine at all . During the year that I lived in Valdivia , southern Chile , ensalada mixta is about all I found to eat in chilean restaurants , and quite frankly I could be blind and drunk and still make a better salad myself . Moreover , to my rage I was charged the same for my puny salad and meatless completos as my friends for their huge hunks of meat . Forgot eating out as a vegetarian in Chile . Go home , grab some veggies from the market and make yourself some good food . It will be 10x as good and cost you half the price . For all I know the meat and seafood may be wonderful , but do n't  even try eating out vegetarian . <p> There are definitely some delicious chilean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some of the best fruit conserves , cakes and cookies . Chilean sweets are decadent and amazing . Even something as simple as homemade chilean bread and preserves are great . Still I understand what you mean when you say Chilean restaurants are lack luster . I find they still have a ways to go be on par with home cooking , at least in southern Chile ! <p> Been in chile for 7 weeks now . I have tried the seafood on the northern coast . Not bad , very fresh , but nothing to write home about . My favourite so far has been porotos from the market behind the la vega markets . The best meal I had was in La Serena at an irish owned vegetarian restaurant . Chilean food is nothing special . I agree with articles regarding their food . Its bland . <p> And to the end you did n't try the real food at least not the traditional so yes , i think you have to specificity that was n't good food for vegetarians . You go from place to place but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are really looking for , so please do n't  despise the Chilean food , because you did n't  really tried . <p> I saw how everything started , with a tweet to your link from a chilean guy with many followers . ( i think he s a journalist ) . Then it reached the most read newspaper in chile ( a magazine printed like a newspaper who only publishes gossip and irrelevant articles ) . Then the your article caught flames . <p> Freaking ignorants , what do you know about food ? , going to a lot of restaurants does n't  necessary make anyone an expert in food and i do n't  think these two little freaking ignorants are the exception . Pasta pesto ? .. Are you fucking serious ? , that is not whatsoever Chilean food , anyone with a little bit of food knowledge knows that pasta and pesto are both Italians you fat ignorants and uglies by the way , pasta is not from Italy but they are the ones that eat it the most . What kind of food did you try ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think whoever was giving you advice of where to eat , it was more ignorant than you , did you try a humita ? or an alcachofa with a simple vinagreta ? or a vegetables charquican ? , a cheese empanadas ? , sopaipillas with pebre ? , churros con manjar ? , ensalada chilena o una apio palta ? , leche nevada ? , the old berlin with apricot jam ? , a classic lentejas with caramelised onion on top and cheese ? , porotos granados o con riendas ? .. are you fucking kidding me ? , seriously ? , I can keep telling you heaps of more vegetarian option and places where to find all this ! I think you both are immature , ignorant and ugly , now fuck off you both little shits with no clue of what you are talking about . <p> Girls , please do n't  let those stupid ignorant rude comments get to you . Chileans have a thing when people criticize their food and lack of culture . The fact that people choose to ignore your other amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this country is one of the best in the world , but appearantly people cant deal with the fact that they have been eating garbage their entire life . And to one of the commenter above that criticized Peruvian food : you should probably get your palette operated and try it again . I get that Chileans love their food , but I will never understand why . <p> I 'm from Chile , but i basically agree with your opinion and i 'm amused by my fellow chileanslike , wow , why so pressed ? . There are some typical dishes i really enjoy , like seafood , pastel de choclo , porotos con rienda , mote con huesillo , sandwiches and pastries ( because i really like avocado and dulce de leche ) , but i find most of the typical food bland and boring . Sometimes i eat stuff like cazuela , empanadas de pino , completos , humitas , when i 'm hungry , but i could totally live without those insipid dishes . Thankfully , we have a good number of peruvian immigrants , so we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our salads are usually terrible . In Santiago and Los Andes we some nice **25;523;TOOLONG places , but in the rest of the country , you 'll have to cook your own food if you are vegetarian/vegan . <p> I am french , married with a chilean man , and I have been living in Chile for 10 years now and I think chilean food is a disaster , sorry chileans . I ran a turistic refuge for 6 years in the Maule region and the foreign visitors were so happy to be able to eat my home-made bread , because , yes , even the chilean bread is bad Half my joy of living just disappeared because of the poor culinary quality of the food here , it is even difficult to find good ingredients to cook at home , at least here in Angol so sad because it is a beautiful country ! <p> Ok , I am Chilean and Nationalistic but you are right ! Chilean food is not good at all , if you compare with peruvian , thai , argentinian , mexican , indian and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't  have a good cousine . Our seafood is great , but is not as popular as we think . As much as it hurts my national pride , but the true is the true . Our food is boring .. <p> This is the only time I visit your blog , but I have to say : it makes me sad that people are taking travel advice from travellers who trash the parts of their travel that do n't  live up to their ( ridiculous ) expectations . Based on the one article I believe your attitude towards travelling is terrible and I 'm not interested in reading anything else , to be honest . Food says something about the people who eat it and their culture . You learn from it . You learn about what people like and what they consider important . You learn , for example , that Chileans are mostly not vegetarian , rather than hating on the lack of options catering to your preferences . You learn that we like spice on certain dishes , not others , rather than lamenting whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn that we enjoy our cardboard empanadas ( whatever that means ) and why . You learn why a mote con huesillos is the best thing you could possibly drink on a hot summer day , rather than just writing it off as weird . Of course , you do n't  have to learn all those things . You can just experience , compare , and decide its all shit because its not like what you 're used to or what you expect . And that 's fine . I think most people do that in different aspects of their lives . I just find it disappointing that someone who claims to have travelled so much maintains an attitude like that . <p> Not that any attacks toward you are justified , of course . You are right to respond to the attacks . It just frustrates me that you stand by your own hateful comments . <p> Hi Girls or just dany by Now , funny thing how this comment become viral for all the wrong reasons . <p> First I want to say I am chilean , I read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I would like to apologyze for all the hate you have received from the fellow chileans , is a commong thing here people overreact , there is to much stress and haters haha . <p> I totally agree with you about the boring food , more if you are a vegetarian I will say probably you have no options . <p> I did n't  read if you ever had a cazuela , probably that is the best chilean food you can find . <p> All the streetfood is just unhealty , and probably it has the view that everything has here that is make the most money wiht the less effort . <p> Street completos , street pizzas and almost everything here is just hangover food . <p> Also here is extremely expensive everyything , and it should not have to be expensive to be good , I use to travel a lot also on a budget , normally eating in small eateries or even the streets and food was lot more delicious . and cheap . <p> To finish the worst thing here is coffee , after living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awfull . <p> I 'm a little late to all this- but I 've lived in Chile for almost three years . Like you , I 've traveled all over the world . I 've eaten the jaw-dropping dollar plate of Pad Thai in Bangkok . I get it . The food here in Chile is consistently disappointing . We 've had insanely expensive dinners , as well as what you were eating . 99 percent of the time we leave a restaurant a hundred dollars poorer and shaking our heads . here 's the thing . Chileans can not handle criticism . At all . And then you have to deal with all of the people who came here once , fell in love , and have this lingering romantic vision of the country . There are lots of great things about the country , and I add to my list of cool things to do and see here every day . But Lord help you if you utter one word that is n't completely solicitous . I learned the same lesson , and I did n't  even criticize Chile . I used the word Castellano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how all the people who left comment even found me . Everyone wanted to educate me on how that term refers exclusively to Spain . Anyone who does n't  live under a rock know that . However , people use it here . I get memos at work that refer to another version being available in Castellano . I do n't  know why , but Chile is very thin-skinned . You have to tread lightly here . <p> yet another butthurted foreign , you see , in here WE canc riticize our country , not stupid foreigners , because it was your people the ones who systematically extorted our politicians , installing nazi hideouts , reselling weaponry , manipulating the press and even promoting a coup d etat that ended with the lives of thousands of people , we owe nothing to foreigners , and in the best case you should be thankful if chileans are nice to you and keep your mouth shut because from where you come from , also comes our worst disgraces , in general , in the past , present , and in unavoidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill your social insurance so your people can then complain because you have to now experiment the tip of the iceberg we live at as the european unions falls in pieces <p> Ive been living here in Chile for 3 years now and I agree that the food is not the best here .. some dishes are nice , but they are still quite plain . In my opinion they are very homely dishes , not something you really want to go to a restaurant to order . My biggest issues with the food here is the excessive quantity of salt that is added , the very boring salads , the fact that coriander is in EVERYTHING ( I hate coriander ) and the fact that most things are fried . However , there are other things that are really great , for example , I love the fact that you can get freshly made juice in basically every restaurant and that its not that expensive . I love how much avocado they put on the sandwiches , its delicious ! In most other countries they are really stingy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its true that it is very fresh here . <p> Yes , the title of your article was harsh.Would you like me writing a post about how Food from the US sucks ass ? I do n't  think so . While I truly despise food in the US , simply because is not fresh , but rather with a plastic taste , full of chemicals and tons of fat and sugar in it . I think it would be a waste of time and me just being a hater if I decided to talk about it . here 's the thing , yes I am chilean , but my husband was born and raised in the US.We traveled to Chile 3 months ago . He tried mariscal , machas a la parmesana , empanadas de marisco in Valparaiso and he fell in love with the food . He said it tasted so fresh and delicious , and coming from a picky american guy who mostly eats junk food , that is a huge compliment . Coz even though he says he likes good food , he always end up eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know here.Then we went to the south of Chile and tried this homemade cheese , he could not stop eating it . He said it was so creamy and tasty , which I agree . I 've looked all over the US for a good cheese like the one we make in my hometown and have not been able to find , probably coz there 's not such a thing in the US . He tried humitas , did n't  like them that much , but he did love pastel de choclo , our chilean style bbq , for which we actually use a " disco " . He loved curanto , charquican , chacarero . He also enjoyed our pisco sour , terremoto and of course wine . So please next time you want to talk shit about some countrys food , please be more careful with the way you write it , coz that 's your personal opinion . The fact that you do n't  like chilean food does n't  mean chilean food is horrible . Like myself , I hate american food , but I do n't  go around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people already know anyway <p> Im Chilean and the food is terrible . Been eating it all my life . If you eat shitty bland food like my parents generation , you end up having no idea what good food is . And your husbands opinion is irrelevant considering he seems to be the typical Fat American except there are tons of American who actually cook . Of course hell like bland food if all he s had is plastic food . <p> Chile is many things , i love it , but the food is terrible and Chileans need to be more open minded and realize that its now a first world country and its not the 80s anymore . Sopaipillas are an embarrassment to humanity . <p> I 'm a bit late ( sorry ) , Im Chilean and I 'd like to thank you ladies for such a great and positive blog . I think almost everyone who has added a comment has missed one vital fact . When they say " Chilean Food " they actually mean " the food that you buy in a Restaurant , Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chilean Food " ( including me ) it means " the food that we prepare at home that is traditionally of Chilean origin " , hence the problem with the title of the original article . My experience of eating out in Chile is that unfortunately it is a Class-lead experience . So , in theory , the more you pay ( and higher up the social strata ) the better the value should be , in theory only . Add to this the fact that from a certain class strata down Chileans do n't  by habit go out to eat means that there 's very little competition and demand for better Restaurant value . On the other hand eating Chilean food prepared at a friends house , as an example , is a totally different and rewarding experience . Unfortunately tourists to Chile will not likely be invited to some locals house . I 'd say once other social problems are solved in Chile the eating out experience will improve . For the moment what is being sold in many places out there is a shadow of what it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  think you are in a position to judge the food considering you are vegetarians , it is obviously not a country for your culinary taste . If you were Anthony Bourdain , which you a far from , most people would take your opinion into consideration . You should have written something along the lines of why Chilean vegetarian food sucks For people who appear to be well traveled and cultured , I am going to say that I am pretty disappointed about that specific post . Of course I understand you are probably addressing this blog to your friends and bad timing , that particular one went viral But he , who cares about people opinions , it is a free world , and the freedom of speech gives you the right to write whatever you feel like , but sadly it feels like the roots of american ignorance and racism resurfaces in your sub conscience Good luck in your travel ! and watch your back in Chile , lol = <p> Altough I respect your opinion , there 's two big points you really messed up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on that for the next time ( It does n't  mean that everyone will be offensive , but they do have their reasons if they get offended ) and misguiding , you do n't  own the absolute truth , you can say " why we did n't  like it " Secondly , the title does n't  even match what you reviewed , you did n't  taste " Chilean food " , you tasted the " Vegetarian food available in Chiles restaurants and Fast Foods " , 2 very different things in a country that has its main focus on seafood and meat , and in which the typical dishes are " home-made oriented " . <p> In spite of everything I just MUST say that you should be EXTREMELY shameless doing criticism about the chilean cuisine BEING BRITISH ! ! My God , How you did dare to say a word ? ? I am currently living in the UK and I just wan na come back to Chile ASAP just in order to have a proper meal , a proper lunch ! ! Sorry girls , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls have anything to justify about their original post , I 've been living in Chile for a year and I had already read and been told prior to arrival that the general status of food here is bland and a bit uninspired . My personal experiences here only confirmed this , and I 'd even go as far as saying that given Chiles relative geographic isolation from the rest of South America it almost makes sense that whimsical notions of flavours and seasoning have over time been confined to generous dollops of palta , mayonnaise , ketchup and mustard . I will say though that I 'd never have thought of putting sauerkraut on a ( veggie ) hotdog before in my life but now its something I find myself strangely enjoying from time to time . Also much to my amusement and confusion , they sell a kind of spice mixture in the shops here labelled curry that contains not a speck of actual curry powder , the contents instead being an odd blend of turmeric , oregano ( ! ? ) , black pepper and chilli powder . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalists getting all riled up as if their own cooking was being insulted , even going as far as bringing the girls own backgrounds ( or rather sweeping assumptions and generalisations being made about them ) into it as if it was in any way relevant to the topic at hand . Let 's face it , Chile is hardly a foodies haven , and will most likely leave adventurous palates disappointed considering the world renowned Peruvian cuisine and delicious Argentinian pizza available over the respective borders , its really a no-brainer that Chilean food somewhat pales in comparison . And no one is saying that there are n't  exceptions , or that its impossible to eat well in Chile , but why cant you make judgments based on the food that you happen to come across .. especially if passing through to visit the awe-inspiring natural beauty of the place , why should we hold our tongues because we did n't  go to the right places ? after all , a good dosa or curry in India is n't hard to come by , neither do you have to go too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a nice muzza in Argentina , having to make special provisions to find something tasty to eat in Chile does n't  really reflect too great on the general standard of food in the country . And as Chileans themselves have adopted international food traditions to a considerable extent , especially with regards to the proliferation of sushi restaurants the entire length of the country , I think its somewhat telling that the mere notion of Chilean food has a distinct lack of presence on an international scale , correct me if I 'm wrong <p> Your posts are just rude and condescending . I 'm not sure if you 're attempting to be funny , or not but its offensive when you do it about someone food and culture . Food brings so many people and families together , my grandmother who has now passed away had a traditional leche asada recipe that we still use today to commemorate her . It hurts when you say it tastes like flan made with boogers . That is the reality of why people are upset and responding in a similar manner .. <h> Comment navigation 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Dani kept looking at me with my big , funny backpack , and I at hers ( and the extra bag she had filled with magazines she just had to finish before we left the U.S. ) as we walked to catch the bus to the airport . We were filled with exhilaration- that we- were actually free like high school seniors on the last day of school . <p> Now here we are , this is the FOURTH time that were looking back at our year of travel. - 2013 was as much a year of city-hopping as it was spent in some of the least populated areas of natural beauty on Earth . Our travel style was mostly on four wheels overland and technically slow , visiting only seven countries , but we covered a huge portion of this planet this year across Chile , Argentina , Uruguay , the US , Germany , Bolivia and Peru . <p> Follow along as we look back at what we are still able pack in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure . Click through on the dozens of links to read in more detail about each of these stops along the way . <p> The year began in Santiago , where we- housesat for two months . We still think often about our two adorable Scottie dogs there . <p> We were practically becoming locals , so we had to rip ourselves away at the start of February to start our travels through Chile . We began in Valparaiso , and fell in love with this colorful city on the Pacific . <p> From there we headed to the Lake District- and- the island of Chiloe , before returning to the Argentine side of the Andes to explore Bariloche and Nahuel Huapi National Park with its famous black glacier . Then it was time to hit Patagonia . <p> After that infamously long 27 hour bus ride , we landed in El Chalten , where Dani set off on some solo hikes , and continued to El Calafate , where we visited the impressive Perito Moreno Glacier . <p> Then it was back over the border to Chile to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour of the National Park , and it became one of our favorite places in all of Patagonia . <p> After a few days in Puerto Natales , the base town for Torres del Paine , we continued our journey south and traveled to Tierra Del Fuego via the southern Chilean city of Punta Arenas before finally reaching- Ushuaia , the southernmost city in the world , after hitchhiking from Chile back into Argentina . <p> It turns out that we seriously love this town and the surrounding scenery on this first of two visits to San Pedro in 2013 , and were actually excited to know wed be making our way back up here again later in the year to continue our travels to Bolivia from here . <p> During this first visit , we took a tour that showed us some of the breathtaking landscapes around San Pedro <p> But instead of heading north to Bolivia from here , we broke our South America journey to fly to New York City for a two-month housesitting gig that- made our dream of living in New York come true ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York just in time for our third anniversary as nomads and loved our two cats and our apartment , just a five-minute walk from the Brooklyn Bridge . <p> In June , we flew straight to Germany to test out five weeks living in Berlin , which is now one of our favorite cities in the world . <p> We could n't have asked for a more perfect summer in Germany , where we were featured in the Suddeutsche Zeitung , one of the national newspapers and interviewed by a major radio station about our housesitting book before flying back to the US in August . <p> Our next stop was Tucson , to a housesit we 've done three times now for homeowners and a dog , Miss Millie , who we just love ! We enjoyed some quality time by the pool and the desertscape that we love so much . <p> In September , we took off on one of the best adventures of this year : a road trip through New Mexico , which would finally bring us all the way back to Chicago via Colorado , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet little-visited Gila Cliff Dwellings , followed by the otherworldly White Sands <p> Then we spent Jess birthday at Carlsbad Caverns before moving on to the aliens of Roswell , Las Vegas ( the small New Mexican town ) and Albuquerque <p> Then we hit Santa Fe , explored Georgia O'Keeffe country , the Bandelier Cliff Dwellings , various Pueblos and then finally spent time in magical little Taos , our last stop in New Mexico . Here we got to trek down into the Rio Grande gorge with llamas- and our wonderful guide Stuart of Wild Earth Llama Trekking . <p> After 19 incredible days on the road , we reached Chicago , where we visited friends and family , hit plenty of our favorite sightseeing spots and ate our way across the city . <p> Chicago is where Dani got to experience her first real Halloween in the U.S. !

This is the jumping-off point for the beautiful Elqui Valley , which became one of our five favorite places in all of Chile . <p> Then we traveled 19 hours through the narrow piece of land between the Andes and the Pacific to Iquique , a beach city in the north of Chile . The town grew on us slowly , and we ended up enjoying our fourth visit to the Pacific in 2013 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . <p> Then we went on to San Pedro and made sure to visit the Tatio geyser fields an incredible piece of desert nearly 5,000m high where geysers explode , gurgle and spurt . It was well worth the 4am wake-up call to see the geyser field at sunrise . <p> After a few days of an obsessive amount of research on good tour companies , we finally jumped on our three day off-roading tour through Bolivia 's South West , otherwise known as the Salar de Uyuni salt flats tour . Our first ever border crossing in a jeep , on a tour and in the middle of absolutely nowhere , there was so much more than the salt flats . We saw more otherworldly landscapes , volcanoes , flamingos , lagoons and rock formations of just about every shape and color imaginable . <p> On the last day of the tour we spent sunrise out on our third set of salt flats for the year , which also just so happen to be the largest salt flats in the world , the Salar De Uyuni . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first stop in the- 4000m-high colonial town of Potosi . For those of you who think in feet , this is 13,500 ft high , or almost three mile-high Denver cities stacked on top of one another . This is officially the highest city in the world , and we enjoyed the- beautifully maintained historic town center which was a great introduction to the country although just walking its hilly streets was a massive challenge at that altitude . <p> Next were three weeks in both of Bolivia 's capitals : first in Sucre , the official capital ( and a city we spent two weeks battling a massive stomach bug that practically laid us flat for half the time ) <p> Our final stop in 2014 was Lake Titicaca , first on the Bolivian side in Copacabana , where we spent Christmas , then followed by a couple of days on the Isla del Sol and then crossing the border into our first stop in Peru Puno where we are celebrating New Years Eve . <p> This was a big year for us as The GlobetrotterGirls as well ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of our book , The Ultimate Guide to Housesitting check that out here if you want to start housesitting in 2014 . <p> We started the Break Free podcast , where I interview globetrotting women who have created the incredible life balance of running successful businesses while traveling the world .

@@107143169 @2543169/ <h> Product review : Vasque Mindbender Trail Running Shoes <p> For the last two years , I have been lugging around both a pair of hiking shoes and multi-purpose tennis shoes for long city strolls and travel days . With just one backpack , size really matters , so I wanted to find one pair of shoes that could replace both , especially the heavy duty hiking shoes . But while not adventure travelers , we tend to do some big hikes , like the day we went volcano boarding , - the day we became cave explorers- and the day we became mountaineers . <p> Just before staring a massive shoe search , we were put in touch with Vasque , who offered to send me out a pair of their Vasque Mindbender trail running shoes to test . I had never heard of the Vasque brand before and was not sure about the offer , but when a few minutes of research online revealed some hard core brand fans , I was convinced to test out whether these were the replacement shoes for me . <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love . They felt comfortable on my feet from the start , which is a relief for me as I have wide feet and do n't  always find shoes I can say are the perfect fit . The shoes are lightweight but durable , and the tread is perfect for the trail running I was doing in the Arizona desert. - The shoes should be even better for our upcoming adventure on the Mexican Yucatan peninsula . <p> We have a habit of traveling to places in their hottest season and one major problem for me is how hot and sweaty my feet get . The Vasque Mindbender has a nylon mesh material that let 's in just enough air to keep my feet dry , and so far I have yet to have sweaty feet in these shoes ! <p> Though these shoes are intended for gripping mud or sprinting through sand , I tried them on solid concrete and was happy when even after hours of walking around my feet did not hurt . For the limited time I spend not wearing sandals on hot city streets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am now confident I have found the perfect shoes for our 4-day trek on the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu in Peru , which has been a lifelong dream . <p> These shoes were provided on a complimentary basis , but as always , all opinions are entirely our own . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

So if you 're on a bicycle trip through Italy : make sure to lock up your bike before you cross the bridge to the lagoon city . There are also absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 400 bridges and 118 islands <p> Venice comprises of 118 islands which are connected by 400 bridges and intervened by 177 canals . Remember that these are all footbridges " the most famous ones are the Rialto Bridge and the Bridge Of Sighs . <p> 4 ) The main entrances to the houses are on the canal side <p> While walking through the city , you might see that the entrance doors to the houses , even the majestic palace-like ones , are never as lavish as one might suspect for houses that big and pompous . That 's because the actual entrances of the houses in Venice is located on the canal side " the canals used to be the real streets of Venice , and that 's where the proper entrance doors where built . <p> Venice by Joakim Berndes on Flickr.com <p> 5 ) Venice is sinking <p> The city has been steadily sinking over the past few centuries .

Every decade , the city sits 10 centimeters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches in a century ! <p> 6 ) There is only one female gondolier <p> That lucky lady has been working as a gondolier since 2010 and fought hard to become the first woman to do this job .

In total , 400 gondoliers are operating in Venice today , compared to 10,000 in the 16th century . You have to have a license to operate one of the 350 gondolas in the city . <p> 7 ) 20 million tourists vs. 56,000 Venetians <p> The amount of tourists who visit Venice every year is insane : nearly 20,000 people flock to the lagoon city ! They outnumber the 56,000 inhabitants by far , especially during the summer months . In the Golden Days of Venice , the city had 140,000 inhabitants , by the way , but because it is n't particularly easy to live in a city surrounded by water and annual flooding and to maintain the buildings , which is why many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx989335

I had ( not for the first time ! ) forgotten to print my ESTA confirmation , proving that my Visum USA was still valid , but the lady at the Norwegian Air check-in desk was kind enough to let me check in anyway , and then I spent nearly ten hours at the Oslo Airport because my connecting flight was delayed .

@@107143178 @2543178/ <h> 33 things I love about Austin <p> I spent nearly a month in Austin and Ive already mentioned in my monthly round-up that I 've got a huge crush on Texas quirky capital who knew that a city in Texas of all places could sweep me off my feet the way that Austin did . I 've done a fair amount of traveling in the U.S. during the past 6 years , including numerous road trips that brought me to dozens of U.S. cities but I do n't  think Ive ever declared that I am so enamored with a place that I could see myself live there that has always been NYCs prerogative . But I think I might want to make an exception for Austin . Why ? Well , let me share 33 of the things that I love about Austin <h> 1 The food trucks <p> Of course , for me as a foodie , a city with dozens of food trucks is a culinary paradise . Even if I had tried to eat at a different food truck every day during my month long visit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which means I 'll have to come back to continue my quest to try all of them . My favorite so far ? Gourdoughs Big.Fat.Doughnuts . Yes , I have a sweet tooth , and I do n't  eat BBQ ( or any kind of meat ) , so its a dessert food truck that takes the crown ( for now ) . If you 're visiting Austin and are wondering which food trucks are the best , here are 10 food trucks you need to visit in Austin and if you still have room for more , 17 essential food trucks in Austin . <h> 2 The weather <p> I do n't  think any city could ever come close to how much I love New York , but Austin did impress me a lot and one point where it wins over NYC is without a doubt the weather . While my friends in New York were still wearing scarfs and winter jackets at the beginning of May , I was sweating by the pool . And months of ice and snow ? Not in Austin ! Its not rare to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perfect . <h> 3 An outdoors-y city <p> I read that Austins one of the most active cities in the US , and yes , I always saw people being active : kayaking , SUPing , swimming , rowing , climbing , running , cycling , hiking .. I love how many hiking trails there are within the city limits or just outside of them , and how many people were on the river doing some sort of water sport every weekend . <h> 4 The Colorado River <p> Not only do I love the river that runs through Austin ( although I couldve done without the water snake that chased me while I was blissfully paddling on my board ) but also how well developed its shores are . You can walk , run or cycle on each side for miles , there are bars and restaurants right by the water , and there are plenty of things to do on the river , as mentioned in #3 . I love being by the water , and I ended up almost daily by the Colorado River either running , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady who SUPd with her two dogs ! <h> 5 The craft beer scene <p> Austin has an amazing amount of craft beer bars and microbreweries and if there 's a way to my heart , then its with sugar and craft beers . I loved sampling local Texan beers and micro brews from all over the US while I was in Austin , and I feel like I only scratched the surface ! But I do n't  think its impossible to ever work my way through all the beers that I can try in places like Bangers Sausage House &amp; Beer Garden or Growler ( both with over 100 craft beers on tap ) or the Ginger Man ( with over 70 taps ) . If you 're looking to try some of Texas best brews , head to Craft Pride , with over 50 Texan beers on tap ! Other favorites include : Draught House Pub &amp; Brewery , Pinthouse Pizza , the Black Sheep Lodge and Easy Tiger . <h> 6 Decent pizza <p> After eating my way through many many of New Yorks famous ( and less famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit that Ive become a bit of a pizza snob . So its understandable that I was skeptical when I tried Home Slice , a pizza place that a lot of people had raved about . But guess what : It was definitely a good pizza ! And days later I came across an article that the best pizza in all of Texas was actually coming from an Austin-based place as well : Via 313 . While I did n't  get around to trying it before I left ( another excuse to return ! ! ) I trust the good reviews . <h> 7 Red River music district <p> The Red River music district , which basically means the live music venues on Red River Road , is THE place to be on weekends if you 're into live music . There are super famous venues like Stubbs where bands like Metallica , Vampire Weekend or The Yeah Yeah Yeahs have played , but also smaller venues like Mohawk and Cheap Charlies which had amazing live bands and a great atmosphere every time I was there . <h> 8 Speakeasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars , and I was thrilled when I heard that Austin had several of these semi-secret , semi-hidden cocktail bars . I am still working my way through the lists of the best speakeasy bars in Austin , but I loved the sleek cocktails at the secret bar at the W hotels Living Room and ultra cool Garage . For more , check out 9 secret bars in Austin and how to get into each . <h> 9 The sunset spot in Zilker Park <p> Zilker Park is Austins largest city park and not only that it also offers great views over Downtown Austin . I loved the views from the little hill near the Rock Island , especially around sunset , when the high rises were bathed in a golden light . <h> 10 Chicken Shit Bingo <p> Even though I never made it to the Little Longhorn Saloon , where people gather for Chicken Shit Bingo on Sunday nights , just knowing that such thing exists made me love Austin a little more . <h> 11 The bats <p> Yes , you 've read that right : bats ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but 1.5 million of them , apparently ( which is more than the citys human population ) , making it the largest urban bat colony on the planet . Most of these bats live under the Congress Avenue Bridge and they fly out in huge droves every night just after sunset a spectacular sight , because it takes over 30 minutes until all the bats have come out ( you ca n't help but ask yourself : where the heck are they all coming from ! ? ) . The flight of the bats is a tourist attraction , and while it gets fairly packed on top of the bridge and at a viewing area below every night , I think it is well worth joining the crowds . If you want to see this spectacle for yourself , here 's everything you need to know about the flight of the bats . <h> 12 Unpretentious rooftop bars <p> Spending most of my time in NYC where rooftop bars usually mean feeling like sardines in a can and sipping on mediocre , overpriced drinks , I was amazed to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking the views over Manhattans skyline , but Austins downtown buildings are n't  ugly either especially lit up at night . The bars were barely ever crowded , not even on weekend nights , and drinks were reasonably priced . Some of my favorite spots were the Handle Bar , the Hangar Lounge and The Market . <h> 13 Apartment complexes with kayak docks <p> Austin has the already mentioned Colorado River ( #4 ) , and it seems like many Austinites appreciate the river just as much as I did , with a lot of locals having their own kayaks and stand-up paddle boards . I loved that when I walked by the apartment complexes right by the river , I discovered that not only do almost all of them have communal swimming pools ( you hear that , NYC ? ) and BBQ areas , but also kayak docks right outside the apartments , and often there were kayak storage racks on the property . Being used to tiny New York apartments , where storing a bicycle can already be difficult , let alone a kayak ! , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be in one of those buildings , and I 'd buy a kayak right away . <h> 14 The thriving coffee shop scene <p> As someone who does n't  only love coffee , but works remotely and thus spends a lot of time in coffee shops , I was over the moon when I discovered that Austin had a number of excellent ones ! And one thing I particularly enjoyed : that most of them doubled as bars , like one of my favorites , Radio Coffee &amp; Beer or Halcyon . There were too many coffee shops to try ( here are 12 worth a visit ) another reason why I need to go back ! <h> 15 Rainey Street <p> It seemed like 6th Street , Austins main bar drag , was frequented mainly by tourists , while the locals preferred other spots , such as the bars on Rainey Street which always attracted a large crowd of Austinites . The bars there are housed in little historic bungalows which have been fixed up and converted into cocktail bars . Most of them have big porches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Plus , some of my favorite bars are on this street : the already mentioned Bangers and Craft Pride , as well as the Container Bar , Javelina and Blackheart. <h> 16 Pinball Arcades <p> One quirky thing about Austin are its old-fashioned pinball arcades something I 've never seen anywhere in this form : Large rooms filled with pinball machines , lined up side by side , ranging from vintage Metallica or Indiana Jones themed games to brand new Iron Man themed ones . Apparently such arcades used to be ubiquitous all over the U.S. , but there are barely any left . Not in Austin though , where you can still spend a fun evening of pinball-ing and other games for only a few dollars in one of the citys games arcades , most famously Pinballz . If you want to join the Pinball &amp; gaming fun , here are five Austin arcades worth visiting . <h> 17 Live music galore <p> I knew that Austin was a famous live music spot , but I had no idea that it had so many music venues . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the city and would come back for those alone . If you 're visiting Austin and want to enjoy some live music , check out this list of the 10 Best Places For Live Music in Austin ( an excellent list ) or The Guardians Top Ten Live Music Venues In Austin . <h> 18 Public transportation <p> Okay , Austins public transportation is probably not perfect but it served me well . I happened to be in town when Uber and Lyft waved goodbye to Austin and was n't sure how I 'd get around on boozy nights out after their departure . One of my friends told me that buses were actually pretty good , running all night and only costing $1.25 a ride , or $2.50 for a day ticket . Like I said whenever I needed to use public transportation , it was fast and easy something I cant say about all of the US cities Ive visited . ( That said , I was happy to have a car during my time in Austin because most places are very spread out ) . <h> 19 Barton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than a football field ( amazing if you want to swim some laps ) and is fed by Main Barton Spring , the fourth largest natural spring in Texas . Austinites pay only $3 , and you can stay as long as you want . It is the perfect place for a refreshing dip on a hot Texan summer day . <h> 20 The Alamo Drafthouse <p> I know , a movie theater that has full restaurant service is n't something that you find only in Austin , but I love that there are four ( ! ) Alamo Drafthouses , and I thought that the beer menu was larger than the beer menu of some bars I 've been to ( not in Austin , of course ! ) . Plus , some of the theaters seemed fairly new , which I appreciated after spending way too many evenings in New Yorks one and only comparable cinema , the old and worn Nitehawk Cinema ( note : If the rumors are true , Downtown Brooklyn will get an Alamo Drafthouse in 2016 ! ) . The best events in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , but the sing-alongs , ( 80s and 90s themed ? Yes ! ! ) and quote-alongs. <h> 21 Eeyores Birthday Party <p> A city that celebrates Eeyores birthday ( yes , Eeyore as in Winnie the Poohs best friend ! ) in the form of a hippie festival my kind of city , no question . At this festival , held in Pease Park on the last Saturday in April , you find hippies , weirdoes , kids , grandparents , and pretty much anyone who likes to dress up for a day . Everyone comes together to enjoy live music , games , food and drinks and this has been happening since 1963 ! <h> 22 Keep Austin Weird <p> That 's the citys motto , so I do n't  think I need to say more . But just a few things to show you how weird Austin is : #21 , Eeysores Birthday Party , is a great example , but there is also a Museum of The Weird , a Cathedral of Junk , and for some reason , lamp posts that carry stuffed animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Museum of Natural &amp; Artificial Ephemerata ( another museum full of weird stuff , run by a family and housed in a private home ) . <h> 23 Theres art lots of it ! <p> I love art , and frequent art galleries and museums on a regular basis . That 's why I was excited to discover that Austin has quite a few places that are a must for art lovers : the Blanton Museum Of Art , the Mexic-Arte Museum , the Jones Center ( Contemporary Art , but currently undergoing renovations ) , the Umlauf Sculpture Garden , and last but not least the trendy Yard Dog art gallery . <h> 24 Doug Sahm Hill <p> Take a date there to marvel at the skyline of Downtown Austin and try NOT to fall in love ( with your date or with Austin , I 'll leave that up to you ) . One of the most romantic moments I had was on Doug Sahm Hill . For a similarly awesome view check out Lou Neff Point , right on the river , where I took the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a bike sharing system is a good city , and Austin is no exception . Plus , Austin is a bike-friendly city in general but for visitors who want to use them : Bcycles can be rented for $8 per day with an unlimited number of 30-minute rides , or $15 for three days which is perfect for anyone who 's spending a weekend in Austin ! <p> You can cycle along the river for miles and miles <h> 26 Festivals <p> Austin is a city of festivals In addition to Eeyores big birthday bash ( #21 ) , the city celebrates music of course most importantly SXSW ( see #33 ) , but there are also a great number of other music festivals ( like Austin City Limits ) , plus festivals dedicated to spam , hot sauce , kites , .. to name just a few . And then there are festivals like the Louisiana Swamp Thing and Crawfish Festival , the Austin Rodeo , various street festivals and so much more . <h> 27 Cheap Parking <p> Yes , this is another one that comes from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30-minute parking for only roughly $11 ( yes , Manhattan , I 'm talking about you ! ) , I was delighted to find cheap parking everywhere around the city . I think the most I paid was $1.25 per hour , and I even got to park for free ( for two hours ) right by the river for my daily workouts and also on 6th Street , the touristy bar drag of Austin mind blown ! Imagine pulling up right by Central Park or on Broadway and not having to pay for it . <p> Cheap downtown parking what 's not to love ? ! <h> 28 Hope Outdoor Gallery <p> I love street art , and I appreciated the big murals around Austin , but my favorite place for graffiti was the Hope Outdoor Gallery , an abandoned construction site turned paint park . What was supposed to become a condominium complex but was never finished is now a concrete wasteland covered in colorful graffiti , tags and murals , with aspiring artists coming here to practice their skills . I love the concept , and you can pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is working on a piece . <h> 29 The Highball karaoke bar <p> This is not just your regular ol karaoke bar this is a karaoke bar that will turn even the biggest karaoke grinch into an enthusiastic singer . The Highball is famous for its themed rooms ( there are seven of them ) , including a Black Lodge ( of Twin Peaks fame ) , a scary room ( think The Shining ) , or a satanic room for Black Metal lovers . I do n't  even like karaoke , but kinda wanted to move in there ! <h> 30 Voodoo Doughnut <p> Even though Voodoo Doughnut was born in Portland , their Austin branch is nothing short of amazing and deserves a mention ( I am obviously a huge doughnut fan , see #1 ) . What surprised me the most was n't how delicious the donuts were but how cheap they were ! Thanks for keeping your prices adequate , Voodoo , even in what I guess must be a pricey location right in the center of it all on 6th Street.If you prefer savory over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tacos , which were perfected in Austin . These days , you can get a breakfast taco in too many places to try them all , but if you 're up for a challenge , Austin Eater recommends 24 essential breakfast tacos in Austin to work your way through . <h> 31 Proximity to nature trails <p> I 've already mentioned that Austinites are outdoorsy people , but the possibilities for hikes and other activities do n't  stop at Austins city limits there are so many things to do around Austin , I do n't  think I 'd ever get bored ! If you need a break from the city , some of the nature trails around Austin you can escape to are the Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge , Pedernales Falls , Hamilton Pool , McKinney Falls State Park , Bastrop State Park or Lake Travis.Youre not into hiking ? No problem ! There 's plenty of other stuff to do around Austin : the Texas Hill Country which is great for road trips and has several wineries which can be toured , or San Marcos where you can float in a tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avocado Margaritas <p> Need I say more ? ! I love avocados and I 'm never one to turn down a margarita combine those two and you know you 'll have me at hello = There are several restaurants and bars that offer this fine drink these days , but the very best avocado margarita can be enjoyed at Curras Grill , an institution in Austins Tex-Mex food scene and home of the original avocado margarita ! If you do n't  like the idea of avocado in your drink , do n't  worry : there are plenty of other margaritas on the menu , and everything is so affordable . And its not only at Curras I was generally overjoyed when I paid for my margaritas , which is about half of what I pay for a margarita in NYC . <p> Because I did n't  take any margarita pictures here 's one of the many beer flights I consumed in Austin . <h> 33 SWSX <p> Yes , SWSX might be an industry event , but nonetheless it is one of the biggest music festivals in the US , with over 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a music lover , I love the whole idea behind SWSX and every year I find at least one new artist in the festival line-up that I adore ( in recent years Emily Wolfe , Courtney Barnett , Sylvan Esso , Soak and L+psley ) . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 17 Comments <p> I think you and I have the same criteria to make a city " AWESOME " = Youve convinced me enough to make a visit to Austin when I can and I 'll be sure to check this list before I go .

Now I 've finally got an excuse to visit Copenhagen. And when I saw that it was only G20 to get there from Berlin , the decision was made : I 'd spend a day in Copenhagen en route to the U.S. ( I love how cheap it has become to travel around Europe with budget airlines , buses and trains competing for customers ) . <p> I did n't  have much on my must see list , except for the obligatory photo stop by the Little Mermaid , the brightly painted Nordic houses along the canals and Christiana , the famous autonomous district of the city that is known for its alternative inhabitants and subculture ( since it is not allowed for visitors to take photos inside Christiana , I recommend this picture-heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> And so I just wandered the city , turned into streets that seemed interesting , stopped for coffee in trendy looking coffee shops , sat by the water and observed life in the Danish capital . One thing I loved was the fact that there seemed to be more bikes than cars just like in Stockholm , people love to cycle . Spring had just sprung , and while it was still chilly , people were soaking up the sun rays in outdoor cafes ( another similarity to Stockholm : the many coffee shops ) . I could n't have chosen a better city to explore for a day Copenhagen , I have a feeling this was n't the last time we 've met. 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107143183 @2543183/ <h> Brightons epic 25th Pride Festival : Carnival of diversity <p> A gorgeous seaside location , a community known for their tolerance and diversity , and celebrating a quarter of a century of Pride Marches , which is a huge milestone " what could possibly go wrong at this years Brighton Pride ? Well , with the infamous British summers , Pride can be hit or miss . I went to Pride events in England where it poured down on us , and then there were years when I went to Pride events and got sun burnt . In England , it can go either way , and when my plane touched down in the middle of a rain storm on a chilly summer morning , I was worried . Would the epic Pride weekend I was hoping for get rained out ? But I did n't have anything to worry about : I woke up to bright blue skies on Friday morning and it seemed all of Brighton was already in a festive spirit , even though the main festivities would n't start until Saturday.Usually , around 160,000 spectators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event 's big anniversary , close to 200,000 people were expected to attend Pride this year . The 2015 motto was Carnival Of Diversity , honoring Brightons diverse and open-minded LGBT community . I really could n't have chosen a better occasion to return to one of my favorite cities in England ( but more on Brighton later ) . The city had already felt super festive when I arrived on Thursday , with more rainbow flags flying around town than I 've seen at any other Pride event I ever attended ( and I am not exaggerating here ! ) . That reminded me of just how liberal and nonjudgmental Brighton was . Kids with two mommies or two daddies were nothing out of the ordinary here , and a local friend told me her 9-year old had a boy in his class who had a gender change over the summer and when it was announced at school , nobody even bat an eye . Brighton , as accepting as ever.So it shouldnt have surprised me that each and every business was flying rainbow flags and that the city is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country in fact the second biggest after London Pride " but that said , not even London has the same kind of festival atmosphere that you have in Brighton.Brighton parties the entire weekend . And Brighton parties hard . From the opening parties on Friday night until the early hours of Monday morning , the entire city feels like a huge festival ground . A massive festival ground is set up in Preston Park , complete with a funfair ! That 's where the main party takes place on Saturday , and the celebrations in Preston Park feel almost more like a music festival instead of a Pride event but more on that below . The other party hot spot is in Kemptown , Brighton 's gay neighborhood , where during the village street party on Saturday and Sunday thousands celebrate in the streets , DJs spin records outside of bars and bartenders mix drinks right on the sidewalk.And then there is the parade , which was so colorful and vibrant that I never once got tired of watching float after float go by . While there was a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the LGBT community had come over the past 25 years since the first small Pride March in Brighton , there were also organizations reminding us that there are still 70 countries in which homosexuality is a crime not to mention the five countries in which homosexuality is punished with death penalty.The range of floats was very divergent : political organizations campaigning their purposes , fun floats including gay and lesbian dance groups , cheerleaders , LGBT divers , runners , etc. , and the people who came out to watch the parade were just as diverse : families , groups of friends , same-sex couples as well as straight couples it was amazing to see how many people ( and dogs ! ) had come out to show their support for the LGBT community . The parade made its way from the seafront ( a slightly altered route and a delayed start due to a suspicious package that was found on the parade route ) to Preston Park . After watching it for a while we made our way along with the floats towards Preston Park , as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Preston Park , the festival grounds were already packed and the festive atmosphere was infectious . I do n't  know any other Pride event that feels as much like a music festival as Brighton Pride does , and we started exploring the grounds.Preston Park 's festival grounds are big enough to fit tens of thousands of people " some of the tents alone fit up to 8,000 people , just to give you an idea of how big the area is . In addition to various dance tents and a cabaret tent you can find bar tents here , lots of food stalls , some smaller stalls that sell Pride merch , lots of carousels and thrill rides , and the main Pride stage.The line-up shows how big of a festival Brighton Pride is : every year , the organizers manage to attract top acts and chart toppers like The Human Leage , Mary Lambert , Ella Henderson , and British pop stars Ms Dynamite and Tulisa.On the DJ front , Fatboy Slim was the biggest name and had no difficulties in making the crowds dance , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Girls Dance Tent , and I would be lying if I said I was n't impressed by her hot looks DJ skills . About 40,000 people enjoy the DJs and performance acts here , and I loved seeing how many non-LGBT people had joined the festivities . Some people might be turned off by having to pay for the festival , but at -16 I found the tickets to be more than reasonably priced , considering how much you got for it : all the DJs , the acts , the rides , and not to forget all the logistics and security necessary to organize an event like this . Later on , we joined the 30,000 people that were roaming the streets of Kemptown where the Village Party went on until Sunday morning , long after Preston Park had closed . Kemptown is where all of Brighton 's gay bars and clubs are located , and places like Revenge , the Terrace Bar , A Bar , Camelford Arms , Legends Bar , the Queens Arms and Charles Street Bar were all packed , with people dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocked off for cars and limited for pedestrians . While Pride usually slows down on the third day , Brighton Pride was still going strong on Sunday and I was impressed with everyone 's stamina , considering that some people were still dancing when I was already having breakfast . But by late afternoon , Kemptown was packed again , and the street party continued with people flirting , dancing , drinking and enjoying the sunny weather . When I left Brighton the next morning , I was still brimming with excitement , event though I was utterly exhausted after this party weekend . As a festival lover , I loved how much this weekend especially Saturday in Preston Park felt like a music festival , with tens of thousands of music lovers coming together to dance , sing along , drink and celebrate , no matter if gay or straight.I have no doubt that I will be back in Brighton for Pride . <h> Where to stay <p> If you want a B&amp;B experience that 's a bit different from the traditional British B&amp;Bs , I highly recommend staying at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Village Street Party , but still far away enough to get a good nights sleep . - If you are on a tighter budget , the newly opened YHA Hostelis the perfect choice , located a 1-minute walk from the beach , right in the center of the action , and a 2-minute walk from the Kemptown Village Party. - <p> View from my room at the YHA Brighton love it ! <h> Additional information <p> For up-to-date information on next years line-up , the parade route and other Pride events , visit Brighton-Pride.org.I visited Brighton as part of the fabulous Must Love Festivals project .

The route being altered due to a " suspicious package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany ? Surely not ! ) and I do really like the idea of the park being more of a funfair with a festival going on , than just a park with the occasional live music act like what they do in Stockholm . <p> I love Brighton , on so many levels , and its just an hour on the train from me but once again I realised it was Pride weekend a week too late . Fingers crossed I 'll make it next year as I 'd love to blog about it and in doing so take my stand against every regime , country or individual that does n't  believe in diversity . <p> It would be a very boring world if we were all the same . <p> Off to check out their site to see if there 's a newsletter to sign up for , then I make actually make it next year . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

The image I had in my mind of the shores of Jersey was very much influenced by the Jersey Shore TV show , and so I was surprised to find miles and miles of unspoiled sandy beaches on the Sandy Hook peninsula , a narrow stretch of land that borders the Atlantic to the east and the Lower New York Bay to the west . This place couldnt have been more different from what I had envisioned ! The peninsula itself is tiny , 6 miles ( 9.7- km ) long and- 0.1 to 1 mile ( 0.16 to 1.61- km ) wide the perfect size to be explored by bike . And that 's exactly what we did .

We arrived there just in time for a spectacular sunset , and vowed to head back to New Jersey soon to explore more of its pristine beaches . <p> Stay tuned for more photos of our beach day it is super easy to get there from New York City , btw there is a direct ferry from Manhattan that brings you right to the beach in 40 minutes ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> I had thought that about the Jersey Shore too but apparently the people on that show are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

I may have physically arrived here , but the gypsy in me definitely has n't mentally arrived .. yet . And I think I know why : Because I have n't stayed put anywhere for this long since summer 2014 ! Can you believe it ? I was flabbergasted when I noticed it " it just had n't seemed to me like I was on the move all the time , but this break ' that I am taking now , just over 3 months ( I 'm five weeks in now ) , is the longest I 've stayed anywhere since August 2014 , when I left New York after four months , with only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I 'll get into that in a moment . Back to gypsy-ing around New York : This month , I 've lived in Astoria ( Queens ) , Brooklyn Heights and Prospect Heights ( Brooklyn ) , Chinatown ( Manhattan ) , and right now , I am settling into my latest place in Bushwick ( Brooklyn ) " and no , this one is not permanent . <h> What Ive been up to <p> Its been quite a month , despite not leaving New York City in the past 31 days . I am still getting used to the pace of New York again , and if I 'll be able to get more than six hours sleep at some point next month , I 'll be a happy girl . I am already reminiscing about how much time I had for myself in Ecuador , only a couple of months ago . Time to read books , work out every day , maintain the blog , work on freelance projects and get them done on time , and having time to socialize and explore . <p> Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything anymore , I always find myself running somewhere because I 'm always late . There 's too much going on all the time for my FOMO personality to be just like Thanks but I think I 'll stay home tonight ' . This has happened to me in previous years when I spent the summers in New York , and usually ended up feeling completely burned out . At least I know what 's coming = <p> Ive been upping my workload from working one job at the beginning of the month to working three jobs at the end of it . Its a relief to know Im making enough cash to not only get by , but to live comfortably in this expensive city , but as a friend of mine pointed out over drinks the other day In New York City , you 'll always find yourself hustling . You never stop. And oh how right he was ! I have yet to say NO to paid work that is offered to me " so far , I 've been saying YES to everything , because I am always paranoid I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily hustle my efforts to stay in shape ( more on that below ) , socializing , dating , looking for a place to stay , moving four times and dealing with immigration matters , I 've not gotten much sleep ( I passed out on my laptop three nights in a row ) and I do n't  even know where the month went . <p> Last week , when I walked down Fifth Avenue after picking up my first paycheck ( Yes ! I got a job ! More on that below. ) , it hit me though : I am living my dream . I nearly burst into tears in the middle of a crowded Manhattan sidewalk when I had this realization . I had to sit down for a moment and take a deep breath . Is this really happening ? , I asked myself . Sometimes I still ca n't believe that I can legally work and live in New York now . <p> Every time I came here over the past few years , my stay had an end date , was limited . And every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend my stay , how I 'd be able to make New York a more permanent base . Even all the way back in the summer of 2014 , when I first came to New York by myself , I already posted : <p> I just love this city and there 's at least one moment every day when I try to figure out how I 'll be able to spend more than just a couple of months here " every year ! ( I 've got some ideas though ) May 2014 " read the full post here " <p> and : <p> I am still in New York , something I had n't planned at all when I boarded my flight to JFK in May . It only took me about two days to realize I would want to stay longer " even though my time in New York started with a disaster .

I still ca n't believe how lucky I am . <p> The whole thing still feels so surreal to me , even over a year after opening the email that would change the course of my entire life . I do not take any of this for granted " every day I am grateful to whoever was looking out for me last spring when I needed to make the decision of where to settle , having nearly given up on the dream to be able to move to New York . <p> And in spite of the fact that I am still struggling with a few immigration-related issues ( see What Went Right and What Went Wrong below ) , I just ca n't see myself being anywhere else but New York . I am still as much in love with this city as I 've always been , regardless of all the obstacles that are being placed in my way at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time working , running ( see under Other Happenings ' below ) and commuting , I did have a number of memorable moments this month . Highlights included a cherry blossom photo shoot with my friend Kristin , a couple of travel meet-ups , street art tours around Bushwick , several bridge runs across the Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge ( my favorite route , especially at sunset ) , bar hopping nights , my favorite pizza , boozy brunches and finding new cocktail bars . It has also been great to catch up with all my friends here , some of whom I had n't seen since last August . <p> Let 's take a look at what went right and what went wrong in May : <h> What Went Right <p> I Found A Job ! <p> Not only did I find a job , but I found the perfect job for me , and it happened to be the first job I interviewed for ( and consequently the last one ) . I was n't sure how easy or difficult it would be to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and not having had any job interviews in nearly ten years , but somehow it all worked out . <p> I am so happy about how easy the job hunt was and love having colleagues again ( blogging and writing can be quite solitary , my friends ! ) and a regular paycheck does n't hurt either . I was ecstatic when I went to pick up my first paycheck last week even though my excitement quickly faded when I saw the amount that was taken out for taxes but that 's another story . I also got a side gig , and albeit that one was more for fun than for the money , it 's been quite challenging to juggle all three plus the blog and still be able to enjoy New York and/or have a social life " more on that below . <p> I took these pictures on my way to and from work in Midtown Manhattan <p> Sidenote : It makes me chuckle that the highlight of my month was finding a job , something that I 'd been dreading for years ! <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have found a job faster than expected , but I am still struggling to find a living situation that I 'm happy with . When all the bureaucratic things I had to deal with as a brand new immigrant went super smooth at the beginning of the month , I was ecstatic . But then the reality of finding an apartment or even a room set in . As a foreigner without a bank account ( which I have now ) , regular paycheck ( can you see now why I had to get a job ? ) and credit score ( I still do n't even know what that is but one owner told me he required a score of 680 ' ) it is pretty much impossible to find someone to rent you a place , unless you 're able to pay an entire 12-month lease upfront . Well , I ca n't . <p> Some of my room mates this month <p> Add to that the insane competition here in New York , the fact that if you want to do a police check on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just started to get paychecks , my guarantors are overseas , and I am pretty much f*cked , if I may be blunt . And so I 've been bouncing around from sublet to sublet with some pet sitting gigs thrown in , which meant I moved four times in the last month . Subletting is the way to go for now , and luckily I keep getting leads from friends for accommodation , so that I have n't found myself stranded yet , but of course this is no long-term solution , and lugging my stuff around town constantly is really getting on my nerves . <p> Serious Blog Neglect <p> The above mentioned apartment hunt ( seriously , for a good portion of the month I wasted hours every day on checking out rooms online or heading out to view a place ) , the new job , a ton of freelance work ( which is good for my savings account ) and my side gig , I 've found myself completely overwhelmed with keeping up with the blog . I hope I 'll find a better balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got so much awesome content lined up that I 'm eager to share with you , like highlights from Cuba and the Galapagos Islands . <p> Another iPhone Fail <p> I feel like I should just make this a monthly feature . My iPhone acted up again " and I had to visit Apple not once but twice , wasted hours at the genius bar as well as on the phone with them , and even the shop assistant had to admit that a six-month old phone should n't act the way mine did ( and I did n't do anything to it " did n't drop it or drown it ! ) . That 's all I want to say about it " dealing with Apple to get my phone fixed was another time-consuming matter which I could 've done without . <p> At least the camera function of my iPhone never failed me <h> Other Happenings <p> May Running Challenge <p> As part of my **29;577;TOOLONG of 2017 , my challenge for May was to run at least four miles per day .

I am feeling bad for skipping one day though and will add one more run to my challenge on 1 June to make it feel more complete , so I 'll add even more miles to my already achieved goal . <p> Of course I 'll still go on regular runs throughout the next month " I wo n't stop after this . I will , however , cut back my miles because one thing I did n't anticipate was just how time-consuming this challenge would be . In addition to the time these longer runs took , I did my daily exercises and often combined my run with an errand , meaning I 'd take the train back ( I ran eight kilometers to Trader Joe 's to stock up on my favorite foods from there , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quick 5k 's I usually run when I do n't have much time for a proper workout . <p> Replacing my running shoes was long overdue Definitely a highlight of this month ! <p> But I stuck with it , even when it rained ( one time I got completely soaked , one time when it rained I had a treadmill that I was able to use , but that was a good reminder of just how much I dislike running on treadmills ) . During my first week in my new job I had two 10-hour days and two 13-hour days " and I still went for a run after those long shifts which is miraculous to me . <p> Now , as for my next challenge , I 've been thinking about it long and hard , and decided yet again not to do a month of no sugar , which I have yet to do this year , and already put off last month . I 've got several barbecues and birthday parties coming up this month , I just know that at some point I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised a friend to take her on a pizza tour , and on Friday is National Donut Day .. so , instead I 'm going to face my biggest nemesis : Yoga . Daily yoga for 30 consequent days " I 'm curious to see if I wo n't hate it anymore by the end of it ( or if I hate it even more ) . <p> I am running out of ideas for challenges " other than going vegan for a month and no sugar for a month , what can I still challenge myself to ? If you have any ideas for me , please share them in the comments ! <h> What 's Next For Me <p> I 've got another full month in New York ahead of me !

I recommend Vietnam-visa.com for their prompt and accurate support and timely delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Facebook , I also found a lot of great feedback from their clients . <p> Now you have detailed information on how to get a visa on arrival for US passport holders . But , as I said right at beginning of my post , visa on arrival is only an option if you travel to Vietnam by air . Otherwise , you need to obtain the visa at a Vietnamese Embassy . <p> If you have any more questions about a Vietnam visa , feel free to ask me anything = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

You might remember that I came to Sri Lanka for the TBC Asia Travel Bloggers Conference ( I talked about it a little bit here ) , and my first week here was packed with a pre-conference tour of some of the main sights of the country ( Cinnamon Hotels , the hosts of the conference , put together a great video of that which you can watch here ) plus the conference itself , which was excellent . I will talk about it in more detail in my monthly round-up next week . <p> To be honest , I had the hardest time to pick a highlight of the week , because one highlight chased the next ! As for Sri Lanka in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd love the country so much . It reminds me a lot of Southern India , which I really liked , but with even nicer beaches , some Buddhist culture thrown in , a tad less craziness on the trains , and more wildlife including these beautiful elephants , which I got to see on a safari in Kaudulla National Park in Central Sri Lanka . <p> Sri Lankas elephant population was cut in half over the last three generations , leaving only about 6,000 of them . Elephants in Sri Lanka have been hunted and killed for many centuries , starting with the British rulers who killed them mainly to get trophies ( one British army major alone is said to have killed more than 1,500 elephants ! ) up to the civil war in the late 20th/ early 21st century , during which hundreds of elephants were killed by landmines or simply shot .

Over a couple of months , elephant herds , including many babies , make their way to a big reservoir which fills up with rain water during the monsoon season . The sight of the herds marching across the wide open green space towards the water is breathtaking . Our safari jeeps stopped in several places so that we could watch different families interact , babies play with each other and some of the bulls putting up little fights .

And it makes me i 'll to hear that a single British army major claimed to have killed 1,500 elephants !

I am so excited to read more about Sri Lanka = I 'm glad that you were pleasantly surprised by it . <p> That 's a super cute picture .

There are so many incredible places in Australia , you could easily spend a year driving around the country taking in its natural beauty and vibrant cities , checking bucket list places like the Great Ocean Road , Sydney , Uluru , the Great Barrier Reef and Australia off your bucket list . The more time you have , the better , but even a few short weeks will allow you to hit up the best camping spots in Australia.To guarantee your camping trip goes smooth , we compiled the top five things to know before you go on a camping trip in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially important for those looking to buy or rent a campervan , and even more so if you are planning an extended trip and will be traveling with your vehicle for a while . Most travelers opt for a used vehicle and then sell it again at the end of their trip . If you decide to buy a vehicle , I highly recommend this detailed guide on buying a campervan in Australia by Anna of Global Gallivanting . It has all the information you need on how to find a campervan , what to consider when buying one , everything you need to know about paperwork , registration and insurance , how to sell it afterwards , and much more.Once you 've bought the vehicle , give yourself a few days to familiarize yourself with the vehicle before setting off on your road trip .

When the lost city of Teyuna was discovered in 1972 , much of it had been taken back by the jungle , overgrown by trees and ferns , the centuries-old rocks covered in green moss . Only in the past decade tourists have started to discover this trek , but only few dare to make their way to the Ciudad Perdida . <p> That is because it is n't easy to get to Teyuna it takes a 2-day walk through the jungle to get to the bottom of the mountain on top of which the city sits , followed by a 2-day walk back to civilization , and the hike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascended and descended , rivers need to be crossed , jungle forests need to be traversed and all of this in temperatures in the 90s ( 33C ) , coupled with the humidity of the rain forest . <p> I was n't entirely convinced that I 'd be able to finish this trek , but there was no way I could NOT at least attempt to visit the Lost City while I was in Colombia , and so I found myself on a sweaty , strenuous hike through the Sierra Nevada mountains last weekend . As expected , the trek was n't easy , but it was also much more rewarding than I 'd hoped for , with the trek itself being just as exciting as our destination . <p> The mountain scenery and the jungle made for a stunning backdrop and helped forget the pain of walking up steep seemingly never ending- mountainsides , and luckily we were following a river with crystal clear water for most of the way , allowing us to stop at several swimming holes for a refreshing dip . We would often pass indigenous people , descendants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still live in this region , far off cars , telephone and electricity lines , wifi or even cell phone reception . It had been a long time since I 'd been offline for several days , and I appreciated the digital detox . <p> And then there was the Ciudad Perdida of course , which was much more magnificent than I thought it would be , with- 169 circular terraces and- plazas , temples , and dwellings for tribal leaders- in the midst of the dense jungle , much of it still covered in thick moss or overgrown by plants . To reach the terraces , we had to climb over 1,200 wonky and uneven stone steps , but once we set eyes on the sight pictured above , all the struggles of getting here were forgotten immediately . 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Many of my friends who had traveled around South America declared it their favorite country on the continent , and everyone who had been to Colombia loved it . I had n't heard a single bad word from people I knew . <p> Before I get into details on how safe I felt in Colombia , I want to say this : Had I not boarded that plane , had I let those horrible experiences of other travelers discourage me from visiting Colombia , I wouldve missed what would become one of my favorite trips to date . <h> Everyone 's Travel Experience is Different <p> Travel experiences can vary drastically . The two female travelers whose experiences I had learned about just before I set off to explore Colombia , both had terrible , even traumatizing , experiences . And reading about those experiences- definitely made me more careful throughout my own trip . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so much so that I opted for the more expensive World Nomads travel insurance , the Total Explorer instead of the Standard Policy ( because it covers more ) . After reading what was necessary for a claim , I even took pictures of the serial numbers of all of my electronics ( camera , laptop , kindle , iPhone ) and emailed them to myself . I made sure that I had a digital copy of my passport , and left an external hard drive with a backup of my laptop at my friends house . I was ready to hand it all over to some rebels who for sure would rob me on a bus ride through the mountains in which they were hiding out . <p> Spoiler alert : That never happened . I traveled through Colombia for ten weeks , visited big cities like Bogot+ and Medellin , the sketchy border triangle of Peru , Colombia and Brazil in the Amazon , and the coffee region , where my friend 's friend had been robbed a few months before I got there . <p> Ville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safest in all of Colombia . <h> Did I Feel Safe ? <p> Yes . I was a nervous wreck at first , but I relaxed quickly . It definitely helped that I had a companion for the first two weeks , and that every solo female traveler that crossed my path who I bombarded with questions about incidents assured me that they felt completely safe . No incidents whatsoever . <p> That helped ease my mind before I continued my trip on my own . After a 14-day trip almost without any incidents ( I explain the almost later on ) through Cartagena , Santa Marta , Minca and Palomino with my friend , I set off on a four day trek through the jungle , which has become so popular in recent years that not just one group of hikers heads out into the Sierra Nevada Mountains to discover the Lost City , but groups from four or five different trekking companies , accounting for 50 to 60 people on the trail every day ! Sure , that 's still far from the numbers of the well-worn Inca Trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has grown in recent years . <p> The things I was most scared of most in Colombia : Being attacked by one of these . <h> Traveling on Public Buses <p> You may encounter guerilla groups while on a public bus , however , or at least armed robbers , like Anne and Jaimee who were just six days into their trip when their bus was hijacked by six gun-wielding passengers who took everything from them , consequently not only ruining their trip but also leaving them deeply traumatized . I had emailed Anne prior to my trip and took her advice to avoid public buses and take planes whenever possible instead ( luckily domestic flights are very cheap ! ) . Anne also sent me the link to her guesthouse in Salento which has some information on bus robberies in that area on their website , stating that in the past couple of months the last bus from Armenia to Salento has been held up twice by armed robbers . ' Even though the information is older , it is obviously still relevant and worth a read for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus from Pereira , where I had flown into , to nearby Salento , one of Colombia 's most charming and most touristy little towns . I decided , however , to stay in Pereira for a night instead of taking the bus in the evening since my flight got in after dark . I am usually okay with long bus rides , but after hearing about Anne 's experience I flew from Santa Marta to Bogota instead of taking the bus , and the few buses I took were only during the day , and I wore a T-shirt with a secret pocket ( see below in safety tips ) . I survived all bus rides I took just fine and was more scared to be killed by the crazy driving of the drivers ( which seems to be a problem in all of South America ) than by hijackers . But again " this is situational , and Anne and Jaimee who were in the same spot a few months earlier were not as lucky as I was . <p> The Valle De Cocora near Salento I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would recommend avoiding night buses and opt for flights whenever possible . <p> As for inner-city buses : I took them several times and I never encountered any issues , but I read that pickpocketing on buses in Bogota is not uncommon , so be vigilant if you take the bus and always keep your backpack with you , ideally on your lap , never in the overhead compartment or under the seat . <h> Is Bogota Safe ? <p> Bogota was the city where I was the most worried about my safety because the city does n't  have a great reputation . I really wanted to stay in La Candelaria , the historic center , but had heard that this was the most dangerous part of the city , with muggings and robberies even in broad- daylight . The Lonely Planet painted such a black picture of the city that I even contemplated skipping Bogota entirely . You can read their take on Dangers in Bogota here . <p> Eventually , I decided not to skip Bogota but to stay in the Chapinero neighborhood for the first couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial center , where you find more upscale hotels and where global corporations have their offices " in short : a safer area of town . To check out La Candelaria , I hopped in a cab ( more on cabs in a minute ) and went there during the day to see how safe I felt about it and if I wanted to move into a hostel over there.When I arrived in La Candelaria , I was a bit nervous , and probably a bit paranoid , and the presence of heavily armed police officers throughout the neighborhood did n't help in calming me down . However , I loved the neighborhood with its colorful street art and Spanish colonial houses and moved over there a few days later . I thought to myself that the police presence was probably a good thing to keep the bad guys out of sight ( ironically , the police men all disappeared as soon as it got dark though ) . <p> While my paranoia/fear never completely - faded , I felt safe enough to carry my laptop with me during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , at no time did I flash any of these items , and when I took photos I made sure to put my camera or phone back in my bag immediately after I took the shot . I ended up staying much longer in Bogota than expected and was glad that I did n't let the Lonely Planet or other travelers ' experience scare me off visiting Colombia 's capital . <p> Two of the articles that made me super cautious about La Candelaria was this one by Britany : <p> One of the main problems with traveling in a place like Colombia is the mixed information that you 'll get. - Some people say it 's perfectly safe and that they 've never had any problems . Other people have endless horror stories . The thing they often have in common ? They were doing the same things in the same places and conducting themselves in the same way . <p> And I could n't agree more with this " I had heard so many horror stories about Bogota and especially La Candelaria , and yet , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets of La Candelaria at 2am all by myself , and during the day , I walked with my laptop in my bag to work in coffee shops , and not just once , but almost every day ( I spent well over a week in Bogota ) . I hiked in the Valle De Cocora without any incidents but other people were robbed on that very same hike . I felt extremely safe in Medellin , especially in the upscale Poblado neighborhood , but only a few months before I visited , an American tourist was killed there when he refused to give up his valuables in a robbery . Like I said , it is all situational . The main thing to know about Colombia is : there is a chance that something could happen to you . And that 's the difference to a country like Japan , for example , where safety is n't something travelers have to be concerned about . <h> Being Drugged <p> Another reason why I was so afraid of spending time in Bogota was because somebody had told me about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Burundanga ) which is a powder that is usually blown off a piece of paper into a victim 's face , with criminals would walk up to tourists with a map in their hand pretending to wanting to ask for help . But instead , they are drugging you . <p> Always keep an eye on your drink ! <p> Scopolamine makes victims completely lose control over their own thinking " they can be talked into walking to an ATM and withdraw money , or hand over their credit cards complete with PIN numbers , and so on . And the worst part : victims usually do n't even remember anything of what happened to them ! Another way to get drugged with Scopolamine is by putting it in your drink , so not only was I on the lookout for people with a piece of paper in their hands , but I always made sure I did n't leave my drink out of sight when I went out at night . <p> I wanted to mention this here because I had never even heard of this drug but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more aware of my surroundings and apparently cases of Scopolamine druggings- went up by 133% in Medellin in 2015 " so this is definitely something to be aware of . Especially female travelers- , because other than theft , rape is the most common thing the drug is used for . <h> Are Taxis Safe ? <p> My very last stop in Colombia was Medellin , where I was staying with some friends . When they found out that I did n't use UBER , but normal taxis , they freaked out . " This is n't safe ! ! " , I was told , and then I was schooled on taxi kidnappings and robberies in which cab drivers bring you to a deserted area of town to rid you of all your belongings . Hearing that freaked me out , but then , looking back at ten weeks of me waving down cabs , I realized that not once did I feel unsafe in a taxi . I guess it helped that I speak Spanish and was always able to converse with the driver . In Bogota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel , the driver even ran after me to bring my iPhone to the reception , which had fallen out of my pocket in the cab . <h> Were There Sketchy Moments During my Time in Colombia ? - <p> I 'm not going to sugarcoat my experience in Colombia while nothing bad happened to me and I felt safe there , even when I was by myself , there were three sketchy moments I should mention . <p> Burglary in Palomino <p> For one , my beach bungalow in Palomino was burgled . I am still so grateful that I did n't  lose anything , because that happened only a few days into my trip and could have easily ended it right then and there . <p> It happened during the day , and the burglar(s) must have jumped on the chance of an unlocked window ( even though my friend and I were sure that we had closed them ) , climbed in through the window and started to look through all of our belongings . When we returned from the beach later that day , we came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there : all of our stuff was strewn across the floor . <p> The break-in aftermath <p> Someone had emptied out little cosmetic bags and rummaged through all of our luggage . Everything except for the main compartment of my backpack , which I had locked up with a little padlock ( mind you , the key for the lock was hidden in the room ! ) . A real thief wouldve just sliced the bag open , or even taken it , which is why I think it was someone who simply saw an opportunity and got interrupted at some point , and so he/they left without our passports , cash , credit cards , laptops and other valuables . I know : I am incredibly lucky ! <p> Even though that happened at the beginning of the trip , it did n't  change my mind about how safe I generally felt . Beach bungalow break-ins happen everywhere in the world , not only in Colombia . And we were assured that the sleepy beach village of Palomino was one of the safest places in the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medellin <p> The only time I felt a little tense about my surroundings was in Medellin . I had explored the city on my own and was ready to head back to my friends ' house . I typed the address into Google maps on my phone and followed the directions . Halfway , I was stopped by a guy on a pedestrian bridge who was walking in the direction I just came from . " What are you doing here ? " , he asked me in Spanish . I replied that I was on my way home to where I was staying . " You really shouldnt be here " , he said . " Why ? " , I asked , since the area seemed perfectly fine to me . " Its not safe " , he answered , and I immediately turned around with him , taking a longer way home . Even though that path seemed fine to me , I was n't going to risk it after being warned by a local . <p> 20 years ago , Medellin was everything but safe . 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb , placed in the base of this Botero sculpture , exploded . One of only many attacks during the time when Medellin was controlled by the Cali drug cartel . <p> And that 's my main advice : Listen to locals and follow your instinct . My instinct in that moment was to go back . In other towns I visited , like Pereira , a city I barely knew anything about , I asked the hostel staff if it was fine to walk around by myself at night , and whenever someone told me to take a cab , that 's what I did . <p> Guerrillas in Leticia <p> Leticia is a small town in the Amazon , right on the border to Peru and Brazil . I would n't have thought of it as unsafe , but then I happened to come across this short paragraph on safety in my Lonely Planet : <p> A longstanding military presence in the region tries to keep Leticia/Tabatinga and the surrounding region safe , but there are issues . Former narcotraffickers , guerrillas , paramilitaries and- raspachines- ( coca-plant harvesters ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the outskirts of Leticia and Puerto Nari+o run poker houses , dubious bars and the like around the city . Do n't  wander outside these urban areas on your own at night , especially on Leticias infamous Los Kilometros road . ' <p> Quaint little Leticia <p> It should n't come as a surprise that a border town in a region known for its drug production and trafficking is sketchy , but I never felt unsafe walking around there " until one day when my travel companion and I were on our way back to the hostel from dinner . <p> A motorbike with two guys passed us , the one in the back carrying a large rifle or some kind of machine gun . They looked at us , then turned around and drove back towards us . My heart dropped . I felt how my friend also stiffened up and pulled me behind a little wall . I was so scared that I started shaking , and all I could hear was my heart beating in my chest . I was sure we were going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . I am mentioning it because this was by far the scariest moment I had in all of my time in Colombia ( and the only time that I saw someone I 'd identify as a guerilla ) . <h> Conclusion <p> As you can see , even though nothing happened to me personally and I did n't necessarily feel unsafe , I never felt as carefree in Colombia as I did in Chile for example , where I never worried about being robbed or drugged . But in Colombia , where I had heard just too many negative stories , I never let my guard down . It can get quite exhausting to always be on alert ' , but being with another person helped me a lot to relax , which is why I tried to travel with someone as often as possible . <p> Other serious dangers in Colombia : Very poisonous snakes , who are carnivores . <p> I had such an amazing time in Colombia that I would n't think twice about recommending it as a travel destination to other independent travelers , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ) . Just do n't be stupid . Take precautions and be aware of possible threats to your safety , and inform yourself before you visit Colombia , for example with this article and the following tips for staying safe in Colombia : <h> My Tips for Staying Safe in Colombia <p> Dar Papaya : Do ( not ) give papaya <p> This is a very common saying in Colombia , and while it sounds strange when you translate it literally : give papaya , it means making yourself an easy target , setting yourself up to have something taken from you . Basically : if you flash jewelry or a fancy phone , it is your own fault when somebody tries to take it from you . Do n't ever flash your money or valuables . <p> This is exactly what you SHOULDNT do : flash both your iPhone and your expensive camera . But hey .. THERE WAS A SLOTH ! ! <p> Do n't carry any valuables <p> On that note , try to have as few valuable items on you as possible . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was planning on taking out cash , and I had only as much cash on me as I was planning to spend . I rarely had more than $20 on me " unless I was traveling to a new city and had everything I owned on me . For which : <p> Be pickpocket-proof <p> With that I do n't necessarily mean wearing pickpocket-proof underwear ( even though I wore my Clever Travel Companion T-Shirt with an invisible , hidden pocket every time I was traveling from one city to another ) , but just keeping your wallet and phone in a safe place where it ca n't be reached easily . If you keep it in the pocket of your jacket , make sure you zip it up , if you carry a wallet , make sure it ca n't be taken out of your bag or pocket easily . I usually just carried a bit of cash in my jeans pocket which are almost impossible to get into , especially without me noticing.Be prepared for the worst case scenario <p> And should the worst case scenario happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your passport before you leave on your trip , and most importantly : invest in travel insurance . I use World Nomads , and as I mentioned before , I took down all the serial numbers of my electronics to make sure I 'd get reimbursed for them in the case of theft . Read the small print of the travel insurance you are buying to find out what you need to make a claim . And most importantly : Make sure the travel insurance of your choice covers Colombia ! Some travel insurances do n't  cover countries for which a government travel warning is issued . Also know the numbers to call in case you have to report a stolen credit card and write down your credit card information somewhere . <p> Use only safe ATMs <p> I only ever took out money at ATMs in proper banks , not at ATMs in the street . I tried to always have someone with me , and if I was by myself , I was monitoring my surroundings for sketchy people extra carefully . <p> Trust your instincts <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation . That goes for a dodgy taxi ride , questionable travel buddies , or anything else that sets the alarm bells off in your head.Use UBER or another taxi app <p> If you 're feeling uneasy about taking regular taxis , download UBER ( iOS/Android ) or one of the other two popular taxi apps EasyTaxi and Tappsi ( download for iOS/download for Android ) . EasyTaxi ( download for iOS/download for Android ) is more prevalent than UBER in Colombia , but Medellin and Bogota both have UBER . It is affordable and worth the few extra dollars to have peace of mind , knowing your driver is registered with the app , so they will be less inclined to bring you to the outskirts of town and leave you there , driving off with your belongings . <p> Team up with other travelers <p> Team up with other travelers whenever possible . It is always easier to keep an eye on your belongings when there are- two pairs of eyes instead of just one . It is also safer to go out at night in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were walking around all by yourself . <p> Inform yourself <p> I made it a habit to always read the safety section in the Lonely Planet before I arrived at a new destination to inform myself of the safety concerns in that area , - and I always read the entire WikiTravel for a place I visit , not just because it has generally very useful and comprehensive information , but the Stay Safe ' section is usually more up-to-date than the one in a travel guide . I also googled robbed in Bogota ' or robbed in Salento ' for example , before I got there , because I knew it 'd bring up Tripadvisor forum discussions or blog posts for these keywords , giving me the chance to find out if there had been any incidents lately . <p> Have you been to Colombia ?

Im meant to be travelling around south America next year , so this was very helpful ! I 'm glad you enjoyed your trip , now heading over to read about your favourite moments from Columbia ! Getting excited already ! <p> I 've never been to Colombia or even South America as the continent does n't  necessarily appleal to me except for Peru Costa Rica , and perhaps , Cuba ! Nevertheless , the tips you gave are still relevant when travelling to more " challenging " destinations . <p> I admit I was getting hesitant about traveling to Colombia by myself a little before my trip as well ; I think it was all the people looking at me like I was crazy and in wayyyy over my head when I told them my plans to go there alone . But I 'm so glad I did . It was the very first time I traveled 100% solo in a foreign country , and it couldnt have been a better experience for me . <p> Colombia is a very special country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for worse . I will certainly be back there , especially after reading your post , because all of the memories of my trip are now flooding back into my heart . = <p> I really appreciate your honesty with this post . I 've seen so many travelers RAVE about the country and Ive always thought it would be my next South American country to visit . I 'm also quite surprised at how many bad press the country got from travel bloggers , something I never noticed because the blogs I read all only have great things to say ! Thank you for bringing those forth . I think its good to consider both sides of the equation and know what were getting into . I 'm thinking maybe I should try to convince some friends to join me instead of jumping right into it as a solo traveler . I know that fear should not keep me from visiting a country , but I also know how much more alert and vigilant you have to be in Colombia . I would still LOVE to visit though ! <p> Thanks Dani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equation and everyones experience is different . The first time I went to South America was to go to Rio almost fifteen years ago and people had me convinced that I 'd never make it back without something awful happening . Nothing did and I had a brilliant time but its not great when all you hear about a place is negative things . I love Colombia but there were a few times where I have n't felt 100% comfortable there . Such a great article always love reading your blog . Juliannahttp : **26;635;TOOLONG <p> Great blog . I 'm glad you had a safe trip overall . Columbia is a country that 's been on my radar to visit for quite awhile but I 've been unsure and nervous about pulling the trigger . It definitely looks beautiful and common sense plays a huge part in staying safe there . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143202 @2543202/ <h> The Perfect Winter Weekend In Stockholm <p> When I ended up in Stockholm in January , it was an unexpected city break I did n't  have any plans to visit Sweden , but thanks to Viking Lines daily ferry connection between Helsinki and Stockholm , why not take a quick side trip to the Swedish capital , right ? <p> I did n't  know much about Stockholm , to be honest , only what Stiegg Larsson had vividly described in his Millennium Trilogy . But that was enough to entice me . I could see myself wander around the trendy S+dermalm neighborhood , delve into the Fika culture , and see for myself why Stockholm is voted prettiest capital in Europe so often.And that 's exactly what I did . Together with a few other bloggers who were in Helsinki to attend the MATKA Nordic Travel Fair a few days later , we hopped onto the Viking Line ferry at 5pm , knowing that wed reach Stockholm the next morning . When I heard ferry , I pictured something along the lines of the car ferries I am used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that the Viking Ferries play in a completely different league . These giant vessels hold cars as well as passengers , but the rest of the ship is more like a cruise ship than a ferry . There are several decks , a number of restaurants and bars , a shopping area ( duty free ! ) , even a sauna ! Even though you do n't  actually have all that much time on the boat to eat , because you sleep most of the ride , I like having options . And the food was fantastic . Instead of eating at one of the themed restaurants , I had the buffet dinner which includes bottomless glasses of wine and beer how awesome is that . After a few drinks in the karaoke bar , I went to bed and woke up just in time to have breakfast before the ship docked in Stockholm.I had two days to see as much as possible of the city , and to find out why so many people who I know whove been to Stockholm fall in love with it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum , housed in an old industrial warehouse that was converted in a photography museum . The impressive building with its contemporary industrial design was exactly the right setting for the fantastic photo exhibits that were on during my visit , including a Herb Ritts exhibit that made this **27;663;TOOLONG giddy with excitement ( remember ? I used to be in charge only of the photos around here .. Well that 's not quite true but I used to spend much more time behind the camera than I do these days ) . I could have spent hours at Fotografiska , taking in the art followed by an extended brunch session in the top floor restaurant that boasts terrific views over Stockholms waterfront , watching the snow fall and slowly covering the city in a white blanket through the large panoramic windows.Tip : If you come here for weekend brunch , museum admission is free ! Another tip : the rooftop restaurant , which can also be visited by itself , is a wonderful place to while away on a warm summer night when the sun does n't  set until midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 100 exhibits in only 5 years , including cutting edge artists like Adi Nes , whose exhibit I was also lucky to catch , definitely deserves a visit.Instead of watching the snow fall from the inside , I braved the cold temperatures and headed to the S+dermalm neighborhood where I explored the trendy Sofo area ( short for south of Folkungagatan ) . here 's the thing : Stockholm has enough museums to keep you busy for months ( close to 100 ! one of the things that surprised me about Stockholm ) and its a great way to hide from snow or rain , but I wanted to get a feel for the city itself during my short visit , so I decided to save most museums for my next visit . There are a number that I would 've loved to see , like the Moderna Museet ( Museum of Modern Art ) , the Museum of Swedish Design and Fashion , Junibacken , which is dedicated to Astrid Lindgren and all her books ' characters , and the Vasa Museum which is world-famous for its reassembled 17th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Stockholm on its maiden voyage.Sofo was exactly my kind of area " a little edgier , and filled with little boutiques , independent shops and cute restaurants and cafes . On Thursday nights , you can shop here while enjoying wine and snacks , which is part of Sofonight , an initiative to promote local independent stores . The stores range from hip clothes to trendy accessories , jewelry by local designers and creative home design and furniture.Our group met up again for a lunch at the trendy meatballs for the people restaurant , because you cant go to Sweden and not have meatballs , right ? A place with the word meatball in the name would probably not have been my first choice for lunch but it turned out that my worries were unfounded they catered to vegetarians and even vegans , like almost all restaurants in Stockholm . And the vegetarian meatballs were delicious.After lunch , it was time to explore Gamla Stan , the oldest part of Stockholm and the island out of the 14 islands that form Stockholm on which the city was founded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets felt like a true winter wonderland , the snow hiding the cobble stones and swallowing the sound of my steps , making me think that this afternoon would have never felt as magical had I come here in the summer.I finished the afternoon with a walk all the way back to my S+dermalm hotel , the fabulous Clarion ( I am still kicking myself in the butt for not taking any photos there to introduce you to this hotel in a full hotel review because the design was incredible ) . My friend Lucy , who had been to Stockholm before , remembered a beautiful church and cemetery she wanted to show me and found her way back there , even though her last visit was many years ago . Our stroll over the small cemetery that surrounds Katarina Church was one of the most special moments of the day . On this cemetery , graves are lit by small lanterns , and walking through the rows of graves in the twilight hours was equally as spooky as it was beautiful.That night , we ventured to Normallm , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying out the new- K+tt &amp; Fiskbaren restaurant , a steakhouse with a modern twist . My meat-eating fellow diners were raving about their steaks I was a bit lukewarm on my vegetarian alternative , but that 's to be expected in a restaurant that specializes on steaks , and luckily my Swedish apple crumble dessert made up for it . I called it an early night after that because I knew I was going to have an early start the next day , to be able to fit in a few more of Stockholms highlights before the ferry would take me back to Helsinki.The next morning , we were the first ones to arrive on Djurg+rden , Stockholms museum island with a large park area , which is home to several of Stockholm 's most popular museums . We came here via ferry boat from Slussen a scenic ride through the harbor and were excited to visit the ABBA museum , which only opened in May 2013 , not even two years ago , and has already had more than half a million visitors ! While I like some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tunes like Mamma Mia , Dancing Queen or Gim me Gim me Gim me , or sing along when they come on the radio ? ) , I would n't call myself a huge ABBA fan . The more surprised I was about just how much I enjoyed this interactive museum . It seems like people had just been waiting for a museum like this , and the developers , which include ABBAs very own Bj+rn Ulvaeus , have done an amazing job to bring ABBA back to life , or to introduce them to a new generation . <p> Back to the 70s in the ABBA museum <p> Not only did I learn more about ABBA , their story and their music , but there was a recording studio in which I could record a song , a stage on which I could perform with ABBA holograms , all of which can be viewed and downloaded online later when you type in your ticket number on the ABBA museum website what a great souvenir ! It does n't  stop there though I could also virtually try on ABBA costumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ABBAs narrating every single stop in the museum through my audio guide . Last but not least , there was a Swedish Music Hall of Fame included in the museum , highlighting other famous Swedish music acts such as pop legends Roxette or Ace of Base , or newer acts like Robyn and First Aid Kit . I loved traveling back in time and hearing more about how ABBA started out and how they became a global phenomenon . To see how much fun it was to be on stage with ABBA , check out the short video I took at the museum ( and no , that 's not me singing : D ) : <p> What followed next was the highlight of the weekend for most of my fellow travelers " a rooftop tour of Stockholm . In theory , this sounded amazing ! Wandering on top of Stockholm , seeing this beautiful city from above . In reality though , it was heavily snowing and the vision was n't great . And let 's not forget that I am scared of heights , so I was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to truly enjoy the walk . I could n't even take my camera out to document the experience , but the few snaps I took with my iPhone show that you could n't see much of Stockholm in the snowstorm that day anyway . I did , however , see images of what the experience would look like when it 's not snowing ( or raining ) and have to say : WOW ! It looks absolutely amazing and I might have to overcome my fear of heights again when I return to Stockholm , and do the rooftop walk again . Take a look at some pictures of the tour during the summer here . <p> Snowy views over Stockholm <p> The other spot I sadly missed because of the snowstorm would have also tested my limits : Skyview On Top Of The Globe , which are glass gondolas that run along the side of the Ericsson Globe , the largest spherical building in the world . From the gondolas , you 're supposed to have some of the best views of Stockholm , but that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooftop tour , we stopped for a quick lunch at the trendy No53 bistro in Gamlastan , and after that we had the rest of the day to explore on our own . I love getting to know a city by simply walking around , and I was on the hunt for the coffee shop with the best fika the typical Swedish coffee break that involves a steaming hot cup of coffee and a sweet treat , in particular a kannamummabulle ( cinnamon bun ) or kardemummabulle ( cardamom bun ) . I had asked around and between locals ' recommendations and favorite spots of people who had visited Stockholm in the past , I had a nice list of coffee shops that sounded worth being checked out . I marked them on my map and connected the dots , making this my walking route for the day , simply wandering around Stockholm with some breaks to warm my toes in between " after all , it was still snowing . <p> Stockholm felt eerily empty on this snowy day , but that did n't dampen my mood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without having to fight my way through the crowds , like I am used to from walking down Broadway in New York or even Sonnenallee in Berlin , where I had been a few days prior . <p> The coffee shops I stopped at were all in line with the picture I already had of Stockholm : a young , dynamic and sophisticated city with some of the most stylish people I 've seen anywhere in the world . If I were to move to Stockholm , I would have to up my game for sure " basically buy a completely new wardrobe . Mellqvist was my favorite stop on my coffee shop crawl " the cardamom bun I had there was to die for.I ended up walking through Sofo again , discovering new little gems that I had missed the previous day , and I found something I wanted to buy in every single shop , from vintage shop Grandpa to home decor paradise Coctail or the famous Swedish fashion brand Acne . <h> How to have a perfect winter weekend in Stockholm <p> If you happen to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be wise to buy a Stockholm Card , which includes all public transportation and admission to 80 of the most popular museums and attractions around Stockholm ( including Skyview , Junibacken Museum , The Royal Palace , to name just a few ) , plus sightseeing tours by boat and bus . You can find a full list of attractions included in the pass here . The card is SEK525 / US$61 for 24 hours , SEK675 / US$78 for 48 hours or SEK825 / US$96 for 72 hours , making it cheaper the longer you stay . ( Note : the card might seem pricey at first , but considering the number of attractions that are included and that Sweden is an expensive country , it will definitely pay off to invest in one if you plan to visit a number of museums and other attractions ) . <p> If it 's really really cold , take a subway art tour . Yes , Stockholm 's metro stations are famous for their art , sculptures , mosaics and installations " over 90 out of 100 stations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's longest art exhibition ' . You should buy a day pass ( SEK115 / US$13.33 for 24hrs or SEK230 / US$26.65 for 72hrs " basically you get 3 days for the price if two if you buy a 3-day ticket right away , instead of three individual day tickets ) for the subway anyway , since it 's the most reliable form of public transportation , and connects all parts of Stockholm very well . Having a day pass for the metro also saves you the possible taxi scam that is widely talked about . WikiTravel has some good advice on it . Here 's a suggested subway art trail by EveryTrail ( downloadable onto your phone ) , and VisitStockholm recommends these additional stops to check out for art lovers . <p> Also look out for gl+gg ( mulled wine ) if you are visiting during the winter , one of my favorite ways to warm up on a cold day . <p> Visit a sauna " as most of Scandinavia , Swedes also love their saunas . Centralbadet , a historic Art Nouveau public spa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good option . The perfect way to get warm after a long day of walking around Stockholm . <p> Most places do n't open on Sundays , or close early , so if you are visiting on a weekend and plan to do some shopping , make sure to do that on Saturday . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> you might also like <h> 10 Comments <p> Did you end up going to Junibacken ?

@@107143203 @2543203/ <h> Polaroid Of The Week : Charming Trastevere , Rome <p> I was beyond excited to return to Rome at the end of my Italy trip last week " a city I had n't been to in many years but that I had truly loved during my previous visits . Since I did n't have much time , I decided to spend most of my time in Trastevere , my favorite neighborhood in Rome . Located on the west bank of the river ( Trastevere translates to across the Tiber ( river ) ) , it has become a favorite with many Rome fans over the years , yet it does n't see as many visitors as the part of town on the east bank . Why is that ? Because all of Rome 's famous sights , like the Colosseum , the Roman Forum , the Spanish Steps , the Pantheon are located on the east bank of the Tiber , and most people do n't make it on the other side of the river during their visit to Rome " except for the obligatory stop in Vatican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What I love about Trastevere is that is the neighborhood in Rome where not only can you find typical Italian architecture , charming piazzas ( squares ) , cobble stone streets ( many of which are pedestrianized ) , many outdoor cafes and restaurants , but also plenty of street art , which gives the neighborhood a bit of an edge . <p> I love to simply wander around the labyrinth of narrow streets while marveling at the ivy-covered facades , the new street art and check out cute cafes . On this visit , I noticed- though- that there were more tourists than during previous visits " Trastevere is definitely not a hidden gem anymore " but it- has n't lost any of its charming character . If you are visiting Rome , definitely head over to- Trastevere " Lonely Planet has a great 1-day itinerary with all the spots you should n't miss . <p> My wanderings brought me back to the east bank of the river eventually , because there is one stop that has to happen every time I 'm in Rome : The Trevi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacular and elaborate fountain in the city , but also plays a significant role in ensuring your next trip to Rome : Legend says that a coin thrown over your shoulder into the fountain will guarantee a return to Rome , a tradition that dates back to the ancient Romans who often threw coins in water to make the gods of water favor their journey or help them get back home safely . <p> Well , for me it has worked every time , and I am already looking forward to my next visit to Rome = 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> I had never heard of Trastevere .

@@107143204 @2543204/ <h> My Top Five Cities To Visit In 2015 <p> Last month , Lonely Planet published their Top Ten Cities To Visit in 2015 . These are the ten cities they picked : <p> Washington , DC ( USA ) <p> El Chalten ( Argentina ) <p> Milan ( Italy ) <p> Zermatt ( Switzerland ) <p> Valletta ( Malta ) <p> Plovdiv ( Bulgaria ) <p> Salisbury ( England ) <p> Vienna ( Austria ) <p> Chennai ( India ) <p> Toronto ( Canada ) <p> El Chalten , Argentina . Can this little settlement even be called city ? <p> To be honest , the list felt somewhat random to me . With some cities , I can see why they 're on the list ( Valletta for example , which is totally underrated in my opinion , and is featured in a detailed post on Globetrottergirls.com here ) , but with others , I feel like they are completely arbitrary picks , and both Latin America and Asia are undervalued " and Australia has been ignored entirely , while more than half of the list is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put together my own list of cities I think you should visit in 2015 " and if you feel like visiting some of them next year , make sure to check out Contiki 's new destinations as well as its classic tours which include four of the places I suggest . <p> Please let me know what you think about my picks in the comments below , or share your own Top 5 or just one must-visit city for 2015 with me ! <h> 1 Cusco , Peru <p> I have n't written much about Cusco yet but it will get a full feature here soon " It had been a long time since I had been enchanted by a city as much as I was by Cusco earlier this year . Surrounded by the green Andean Mountains , and set around a spacious Plaza De Armas ( main square ) , it is the picture-perfect Spanish-colonial city . It was declared UNESCO World Heritage Site in order to preserve the one-of-a-kind mix of Inca culture , Killke culture ( the ethnic group that populated the area prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Blas neighborhood , set on a hill and lined with narrow alleyways and little squares , churches and cute restaurants , had me pull out my camera over and over again . San Pedro market , the city 's main market is one of the cleanest and best organized ones I 've come across in Latin America , and I loved shopping for quinoa and other grains there , as well as Andean scarves and llama wool gloves to take home as souvenirs . <p> And then there 's Machu Picchu of course , the famous lost Inca city high up in the Andean Mountains that is the main draw for most people to visit Cusco . My recommendation : make sure to spend a few more days in this beautiful city and take in its beauty . <h> 2 Innsbruck <p> Lonely Planet voted for Vienna , but I say visit Innsbruck ! The city has one of the most spectacular settings in the entire Alps , nestled in a valley between the towering snow-covered Alpine mountains on each sides . If you happen to fly into Innsbruck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathtaking landings in the world . A half hour drive out of the city brings you to some of the most stunning scenery in Austria " think snow covered mountain peaks and green Alpine meadows that would make Heidi squeal with joy . The city itself combines traditional Austrian architecture with a young student vibe where you find tons of bars , pubs and coffee shops . As long as the sun is out , restaurants and cafes put chairs and tables outside " even in the winter . Innsbruck is a mecca for anyone who loves outdoorsy activities , attracting hikers in the summer and turning into a skier 's and snowboarder 's paradise in the winter . <h> 3 Mexico City <p> Mexico City 's capital just does n't get enough love , but it remains one of the most fascinating cities I 've ever been to . I remember that before my first visit , the thought of exploring a 20 million people metropole seemed quite daunting , but thanks to the excellent subway system and walkable historic center it is actually easy to navigate the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murals by Mexico 's great muralists in particular ) , diverse neighborhoods and incredible food markets make Mexico City one of the most vibrant cities in the world . When you need a break from the busy city environment you can take a break in Parque Chapultapec , a giant park right in the city , or head to the outskirts of Mexico City , where you find quaint neighborhoods such as San Angel , Coyoacan or Xochimilco , which still have the charm of little villages with leafy town squares and cobble stone streets . <h> 4 Valletta , Malta <p> Valletta is one of Europe 's smallest capitals and is nothing like a typical capital city . The tiny capital ( population just over 6,000 ) is surrounded by a massive , still intact city wall , erected in the 16th century by the Knights Of St John who built Valletta . The city is filled with ocher colored houses , many of which feature colorful wooden balconies . Surrounded by the Mediterranean on three sides and set on a hilltop , you have magnificent views over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Just looking down on one of the long streets of Valletta 's grid layout will have you hold your breath . The city is rightly UNESCO World Heritage site , and I will feature it in detail in a photo post later this week . <h> 5 Vientiane , Laos <p> Vientiane is another highly underrated capital " even though it is one of the prettiest capitals in all of South East Asia . With its quiet , laid-back vibe it is worlds apart from bustling Bangkok or hectic Kuala Lumpur , but in Laos , people usually head straight to Luang Prabang . Admittedly , Luang Prabang is a showcase city with well-preserved French-colonial architecture , a fabulous night market and tons of boutique hotels and delicious eateries , but Vientiane has the prettier temples , the better river sunsets and a less touristy feel to it . <p> What would be your picks for cities to visit in 2015 ? And do you agree with my suggestions , or with Lonely Planet 's ? <h> *Disclaimer : This post was written by me and brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Your list is great ! I came so close to going to Peru this year ( I chose Colombia instead ) but I heard nothing but great things about Cusco . Mexico City is another place Ive been dying to visit . I 'm glad to see both on your list ! Hmm , if I were going to pick 5 cities I 'd say 1 ) Havana , Cuba 2 ) Bogota , Colombia 3 ) Dalat , Vietnam 4 ) San Cristobal de las Casas , Mexico and 5 ) Medellin , Colombia . These are just some of my favorite cities that I highly recommend people visit = <p> Thanks , Justine ! I hope you 'll make it to Peru next year . I really liked it ! Ive been dying to go to Cuba and now that I see Havana on your list I am wondering if I can make it happen next year ? ! = And with two cities in Colombia I really have to go there ! Surprised that its Medellin and Bogota though , and not Cartagena heard such good things about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever somebody publishes a list they claim " authority " , where in reality they publish nothing but a very subjective impression in list form . At least you make this obvious in your title = <p> I did n't  agree with LPs list , but cant agree with yours either . Mexico City I find just too big , and Cusco too touristy . My vote for a city in Mexico would probably go to Oaxaca , and Cartagena in South America I believe both are more " authentic " if that 's possible . <p> Sigh I guess everybody has a very different point of view on what makes a great destination = I do pay attention to lists like this though , they definitely inspire me ! The annual NYT list is the one that I usually like best and where the picks make sense = <p> Hi , Nice job on your list ! after reading feedback from others- top places are going to be personal and often subjective based on a set of criteria that people rate differently than others ! So like to see your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd never visit Vientiane every again , but that 's just how I feel after having been stuck there for more days than I 'd have preferred after we had to wait for our visas for Thailand over a long holiday weekend . <p> Its okay , but not somewhere I 'd recommend to anyone , regardless of the rather lacklustre time we had there . <p> Oh totally . Its more about my personal experience that makes me not look on it so fondly , but I still do n't  think there 's enough there to encourage others to make the trip . Not saying the country is n't beautiful though . <p> I 'd love to see Naples on the list , but its probably quite expected too and nothing new or interesting . <p> These lists keep making my " places to go " list longer and longer ! LPs list does seem pretty random . I 've never been anywhere on either list ( well , besides D.C. , I guess ) but I will be heading to Mexico City at the end of 2015 ! <p> Oh Innsbruck is so adorable ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these smaller cities can be so much better than Vienna ( that I adore anyway ! ) . Recently I discovered Graz and that was such a gem ! <p> Salzburg is just a little too neat for my liking , to be honest = I always felt that Innsbruck was a little more authentic , not just all made up for the tourists . And yes , there is this picture-perfect area around the Goldenes Dachl but there 's also just so much non-touristy stuff , especially around the university . Now heading over to your site to read your article = <p> Happy to see that my city made the #1 list . Washington D.C. Is unlike any other city in the USAand I 've been to a lot of them except Chicagohave only flown through there . Our museums are amazing , literally people from every nation live here , exciting in a different way than NYC and well its beautiful . Of course I 'm biased cause I grew up in the suburbs . ; ) . I 've lived half of my adult life in both NYC and D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oranges ? They are both magnificent cities in their own way . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143205 @2543205/ <h> Adventure travel in Israel : Hiking the National Trail <h> Part I : The Negev Desert <p> Sweat was running down my forehand , my legs , my stomach , sweat was dripping down my elbow , and I felt like I was going to pass out . I was in the middle of the Negev Desert , and I had another day and a half of walking through the burning sun ahead of me , nowhere a shadow . I felt like I was going to collapse , but I kept putting one step in front of the other , trying not to tumble on one of the rocks that were covering the sandy and gravelly desert ground.It was around 100-F/37-C , and the sun had reached its zenith . I turned around and looked how far we had gotten yet it seemed like we had walked forever since the minibus had dropped our group of hikers in the middle of nowhere earlier that morning . The breathtaking desertscape behind me made up for all the sweat and exhaustion , and reminded me that the strenuous hike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nowhere , we were in the middle of a small crater , also known as makhtesh in Hebrew , a special kind of crater that is unique to the Negev Desert . Instead of being created by a meteor impact , a makhtesh is created through erosion . Later that day , when we would finally scramble up the rocky and steep side of the crater , I would turn around and ask myself how it was possible for nature to create a crater so round an even that it looked just like a meteor crater without being one.That first day in the desert was the hardest part of the entire trek . The scorching hot sun was burning on my face , the extreme heat made walking even harder , and the last part of the hike being the steep and winding trail up the crater wall . All that exhausted me so much that I fell asleep on the thin mattress on our improvised campground before dinner was served.I had set off to hike segments of the Israel National Trail , a 1,000 kilometer / 620 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north , beginning at the Red Sea near the Jordanian border in the south and finishing near the Lebanese border in the north.For anyone who is into multi-day trekking , anyone who finds treks like the Camino de Santiago , the Appalachian Trail in the U.S. or the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal appealing , this is a hike of epic dimensions . While the trail has already been praised by National Geographic and other reputable travel magazines , it has so far been mainly walked by Israelis who want to get to know their country in a very special and intimate way.The trail itself is far from being as famous as the Camino or the Lycian Way in Turkey , but it is also far from being as old as those trails , even though it passes a myriad of historically significant places . Not only does it pass places of historical and biblical significance , but it also shows off the diversity of this tiny country : from the Negev Desert in the south to the rolling hills around Jerusalem , the coastline of Tel Aviv and the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient city of Dan , Israels northernmost settlement.Compared to the Camino de Santiago , which has been walked since the Middle Ages , this path is still a baby , inaugurated only 20 years ago , in 1994 . Walking the entire trail takes between six and eight weeks , but we hiked only some parts of it : some of the Negev Desert in the South , the mountains around Jerusalem , and the Lower Galilee in the north of Israel . Since we only had eight days , we got only a sample of each region through which the INT passes , and in the end , we were all left with the desire to walk more of it.For me , it was the perfect introduction to Israel , as I started my month-long exploration of the country with the trail , and it made me appreciate my surroundings more when later on I returned to places I 'd gotten to known during the trek like the Negev . Once youve actually spent time out there , in the vast nothingness that is the desert , walked for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , you see it in a completely different light than if you were just driving through.On the first day , we rarely passed a tree , and other than a few dusty bushes there was no sign of life whatsoever . Often it was even hard to make out any trail at all . However , there were rocks painted with the colors that mark the National Trail in regular intervals , showing you that you were still on track when nothing else indicated that.That night , most of us slept under the stars , and seeing the wide open desert sky above you is an unforgettable experience . Tents were optional , and why would I obstruct this magnificent view : millions of stars brightening the night sky . After a hearty dinner , for which I luckily woke up , we gathered around a campfire to get to know each other better , but the announcement of a 6am wake-up call made me crawl into my sleeping bag not long after.The desertscape we traversed on our second day in the Negev was quite different from the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we walked along dry riverbeds through which flash floods would rush during the few days the country gets rain in the winter , allowing for plants to grow in this otherwise infertile area.Even though the hike felt less exhausting than on the first day ( which is I believe only because our bodies got used to walking in the extreme heat ) , it was still very challenging . At one point , we scrambled up a mountainside so steep that we needed the help of hooks and handrails to get up there.Yet the views and the scenery always made up for the toughest parts of the hike , and I loved the sense of achievement I felt when I made it through a particularly arduous stretch of the trail . A trek like this is about the journey itself after all , not about getting to the final destination.After a picnic lunch in a spot where countless travelers had stopped for water and shelter for thousands of years before us , we tackled our last desert adventure : the Big Fin , or as I saw it : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the makhteshs in the Negev.Knowing that this would be the last big challenge of the day , I pushed through and scrambled up the rocky mountainside , braving the relentless sun and pushing my boundaries . Up on top , once again the magnificent vistas made up for the hike that tested our abilities . We had to make our way back down , and most of us were on the last sips of water in our bottles by then . Knowing that we had to ration our water supplies reminded me once again that we were far away from any settlements and that this is a really rough trek if you plan to do it by yourself.Luckily , trekkers are not completely on their own on the hike , and one extremely helpful support network are the Trail Angels people that allow hikers to sleep in their houses , take a shower or simply replenish their water supplies.Instead of spending another night under the stars , we hopped into a minibus that was waiting for us and drove to Sede Boker , where we met some of said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly welcoming and warm families , and that first shower after two days in the desert sure felt glorious . We knew that this would be our last night in the dry Israeli desert the next day , we would drive north to hike in the mountains around Jerusalem.Continue here with Part II of my Israel National Trail hiking adventure , plus some practical information on how to hike this Trail independently . <p> For more photos of my hike through the Negev Desert , check out my Flickr gallery : 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Lindsey I did n't  know that trail existed either ! That 's why I was so inclined to hike it , and now I am excited to spread the word about it . As for physical preparation : I would n't say so . We had some older people in our group who complained a lot about the heat but everyone was able to do it = Nobody gave up or felt like it was too much , and I would say that most people in our group werent experienced hikers . <p> This hike sounds quite hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I like warmth climates but when its too hot I find it difficult to do intense physical activities especially when is for prolonged period of time . The best part for me would have probably been sleeping under the stars , that sounds simply awesome ! = <p> It was quite hard but I love me a good challenge , Franca = And yes the sleeping under the stars was absolutely amazing ..

In fact , I keep a list in my Google Drive to which I constantly add places I 'd like to check out " anything from beaches , parks , hidden plazas , neighborhoods I have yet to visit ( and there are so many ! ) , restaurants , coffee shops , pizza places , galleries , bars and even though I keep ticking off places off that list , it keeps getting longer . So I was happy that during this visit to NYC , I got to tick off a few more things ( even though I ended up adding more places ! ) before I left .

The poignant look in his eyes , the monotony in his voice . I felt like someone had ripped my heart out of my chest ; I felt it hit the ground and break into a million pieces . I was sitting on my grandmas hospital bed , holding her hand . <p> And then I started to cry . Tears started streaming down my face and I could n't stop sobbing for the next hour . My grandma stroke my hand , saying over and over again Do n't  cry. Do n't  cry. I was supposed to comfort her ; she was the one who had just been told that she has n't  got much longer to live , and yet she tried to calm me down . She had always been the strong matriarch of the family , only looking ahead , and not back . Even when my grandpa , her husband , died of cancer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was always there for anyone in the family who needed help . I could n't bear the thought of another loss this year.Never having been close to my mother ( who most of the time does n't  even know where in the world I am ) , and never having met my father , my grandma was the only person in my family who I would look up to and who I wanted to be proud of me . She certainly did n't  approve of me leaving my corporate career and travel to not-so-safe places like Mexico , India or Guatemala , but when she saw how happy my travels made me and that I was able to build a new career around this unconventional lifestyle , she was happy for me .

I used to spend my entire summer holidays at their house and listen to her travel stories . Looking at her hundreds of vacation photos ( some dating back to the 1930s ) was something I would do every time I spent time I visited her , up to the day she died.When I called her from places like Panama or Patagonia , she usually knew already most things about that place . Geography and far away countries were some of her hobbies , and whenever she did n't  know much about the place I was in , she eagerly asked me questions about the country . She spent most of her life behind the Iron Curtain and was n't able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure had the travel bug . Even last year , at 82 , she still took the train all by herself halfway through Germany to visit the Frankfurt Opera . It seemed like nothing could ever stop her.The cancer came so sudden , so unexpected , I still can not wrap my head around how fast everything happened , how quickly she deteriorated . Within a month of being diagnosed with cancer , she passed away . Gone .. within weeks . Earlier this year , she had the best time when she met her brand new great grandson for the first time and had all her grand kids and great grand kids in the same room . There was no sign of sickness or weakness.This showed me once again though that you just do n't  know if there 's a tomorrow . My grandma would have turned 83 years old this month , and she still had places on her bucket list . Do n't  put your dreams on hold . Live them now . My grandpa was another example for this he had been working all his life towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams and enjoy life . He died of cancer only a few months into his retirement . Do n't  wait . You never know what is going to happen tomorrow.Last week I went to the Botanic Garden in Brooklyn to see their spring flower display when suddenly , I was overwhelmed by emotions . All I could think about was my grandma ; how much she would have loved it there . Visiting flower shows around Germany with her girlfriends had become one of her favorite pastimes after she retired . And seeing her own garden in full bloom was what made her the happiest . Sadly , she could n't see the massive cherry tree in her garden in full bloom again this spring before she passed away , but every time I went to her house to check on it I took some photos to show her in the hospital bed which flowers and trees had come back to life . <p> Tears were running down my face while I was sitting in the gardens , smelling the flowers that she wouldve all been able to name . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were best for her . Her pain was almost unbearable , but short .

@@107143214 @2543214/ <p> One of the things I get frequently asked about are my favorite places go take in a good view of or over Manhattan . A city with a remarkable skyline such as New York is basically begging to have its panoramic photo taken , and luckily there are some great spots around town where you can do exactly that . Some of these are from high above the city , most of them are free , but the one thing they all have in common : they are all worth a visit ! So without further ado here are my top five views over Manhattan : <h> 1 Pebble Beach , Brooklyn <p> This tiny beach right between the Brooklyn and the Manhattan Bridges has seen a major revamp in recent years , with the surrounding Brooklyn Bridge and Main Street Parks getting a face-lift and the beach itself being equipped with large stone steps to sit on perfect to watch the sunset with the Brooklyn Bridge as a backdrop . Make sure to stay long enough to see the skyscrapers of southern Manhattan , including One World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , light up , and take a stroll through Brooklyn Bridge Park . You can walk all the way down to Brooklyn Bridges- Pier 6- through the park , following- the East River- for about 1.5- miles through the renovated park . Extra tip : There are several great foodie spots nearby : Julianas and Grimaldis Pizza for true New York style pizza , a Shake Shack for your burger fix , Almondine Bakery for scrumptious croissants , and excellent coffee at the Brooklyn Roasting Company . <h> 2 The Top Of The Rocks <p> It seems like the Empire State Buildings viewing deck is on most New York visitors must-do lists , but having been on top of both the Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center , I have to say that I preferred the Top Of The Rock for three reasons : 1 ) I could actually see the Empire State Building from up there , and it looks great in the skyline photos I took up there , 2 ) you can see Central Park from here which makes you realize what a massive space this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  as crazy as the lines at the Empire State Building . On top of that , tickets are considerably cheaper at $32 ( vs $52 for both the- Main Deck + Top Deck ( 86th &amp; 102nd Floors ) of the- Empire State Building . ) <p> Extra tip : For an extra $15 , you can visit the Top Of The Rock twice in one day once during the day and once at night and its still cheaper than the Empire State Building . The observation deck is open daily from 8am till midnight , and you can save yourself the time to wait in line by buying your tickets online here . <h> 3 The Staten Island Ferry <p> The Staten Island Ferry has some of the most remarkable views of Southern Manhattan in fact these are views you do n't  get from anywhere on the island and the best thing : you do n't  have to pay a cent for these stunning views . My tip is to take a ferry over to Staten Island about 20 minutes before sunset , and the next one back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathing in a wonderful orange light , and a fully lit-up city on the way back . Extra tip : If you only have limited time in New York , do n't  bother visiting the Statue Of Liberty . Lines to get there ( and to get on top ) are usually outrageously long , and the views you get of the statue from the free Staten Island ferry are almost as good as taking the $18 Liberty Island ferry . <h> 4 East River State Park Beach <p> Another one of Brooklyns East River beaches , but the views from here are very different from the Pebble Beach vistas in #1 since the river makes a big turn and you 're much further north . Featured in your views here are the Williamsburg Bridge and the southern Manhattan skyscrapers to the south and the midtown skyscrapers including the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building to the north . <p> Extra tip : If you happen to be in New York over the weekend , plan your visit for a Saturday and combine it with a stroll over the Smorgasburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River State Park between April and November ( 11am 5pm ) . You can sample some of New Yorks best restaurants , coffee shops , ice cream sandwiches , pizza , lobster rolls and lots of yummy ethnic food from 100 vendors .. One of my favorite food markets in New York ! <h> 5 The Roosevelt Island Aerial Tramway <p> The ride in the alpine-style gondola- is short and sweet , not lasting longer than five minutes , but the views over the East River , the **36;692;TOOLONG Queensboro Bridge and the concrete canyons of Midtown Manhattan are unrivaled plus , the ride is free if you buy a 7-day Metro Card ( $31 , usually the cheapest option for New York visitors , even if you only spend five days in the city , since there are no day tickets and a single ride is $2.75 ) the aerial tramway is part of the MTA ! <p> Once you reach Roosevelt Island , you should n't head straight back to Manhattan though walk down to the southern tip of the island instead , where the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home state , opened in late 2012 . The memorial- is worth a visit in itself ( free admission , but closed on Tuesdays ) , and- also offers beautiful views over the East River , Long Island City and Eastern Manhattan , including the UN building and the Chrysler Building . <p> Extra tip : If you want to spend more time on Roosevelt Island , there 's plenty more to see on the thin , only 2 mile long island. - The ruins of the Smallpox Hospital can be a bit creepy ( enhanced by the fact that the hospital hosted patients with contagious diseases in the 19th century ) , but are a dream for photographers , and on the northern tip of the island you find the Blackwell Island Lighthouse . For more places worth checking out on the island , check out this article : Roosevelt Island : A day away from the city without leaving the city . There are a few shops on Roosevelt Island and there is a Starbucks , but bringing some picnic food is not a bad idea if you 're spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course there are plenty of more views over New York to be found , for example from Rainey Park in Astoria , Queens ( northern Manhattan ) , from Governors Island ( southern Manhattan ) , the new One World Trade Center Observation Deck ( which I hope I 'll be able to check out soon ! ) , the rooftop of the Metropolitan Museum Of Art ( do n't  miss the rooftop if you 're visiting the museum ! ) , Gantry State Park in Long Island City ( East River and Eastern Manhattan ) , Brooklyn Heights Promenade , Greenwood Cemetery for further-away views over Manhattan . And then there are dozens of rooftop bars all over- Manhattan , with fabulous places- like 230 5th , the Press Lounge , Upstairs . PH-D or Le Bain , to name just a few.Extra- tip : - If you love views from above as much as I do , check out the Manhattan rooftop bar crawl during which you visit five different rooftop bars all over Manhattan . The crawl includes one drink in each bar , skip-the-line access and priceless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing .

That should n't come as a surprise White Sands is a desert after all , and as many of you know I love deserts .

The contrast between the bright blue skies and the white sand makes for some great photo opps , and I ended up with over 600 photos of my day at White Sands , even though it was my second time there ! <p> It was , however , my first sunset something I really wanted to photograph .

In the end , we made it back to the parking lot though and finished our day in White Sands with a picnic in one of the futuristic picnic areas . <p> I felt lucky that I got to visit this remote place not only one , but two times and I would n't mind returning for a third visit . 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107143219 @2543219/ <h> Things you need to know when hiking the Lycian Way <p> Since I made the decision to take a long-distance hike later this year I have been researching several popular as well as lesser known hikes in and around Europe . I thought I 'd share some of the details for each hike with you here , so that those of you who are looking to take one of these hikes too can benefit from the things I found out- details of the route , the distance of the hike , how to get there , costs and duration and what to pack . <p> The Lycian Way in southwestern Turkey is one of the top three hikes I am considering to walk , a coastal hike that involves spectacular views , historical sites from the Greek culture and Roman Empires saying back to 8BC and traditional villages that seem untouched by tourism . The trail follows the coast , leads through pine forests , and always has a spectacular mountain backdrop . It is mostly made up of old mule trails and hundreds of year old footpaths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest trails in Turkey , totaling a length of 509km ( 315 miles ) . <p> You 'll sleep in guest houses , village homes and basic B&amp;Bs along the way . Since you have to camp in some parts of the way , this is definitely a trek for more advanced hikers who like to rough it , and do n't mind very basic sleeping conditions , lack of bathrooms along the way and purifying their water . <h> Location : <p> The Lycian Way is located on Turkeys Tekke Peninsula , which is historically known as Lycia , hence the name . It connects the small coastal town of +l++deniz ( near Fethiye ) with Hisarcandir ( west of Antalya ) and follows the coast it never moves away more than 15 kilometers from the Mediterranean . Sometimes it climbs high into the mountains , other times it is at sea level , it leads through pine forests and along steep cliffs . <h> How to get there : <p> Depending on which side you 're planning to start on , you could fly either into Dalaman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting point ) or into Antalya ( the eastern starting point ) . <p> Depending on where you 're coming from you could also fly into Istanbul and take a connecting flight to either city from there , but direct flights to the Tekke Peninsula are available from all major European airports at very low prices ! Thomas Cook Airlines flights to Dalaman for example start at only -50 from Britain . <p> The Lycian Way by Zak on Flickr.com <h> Best time to go <p> Obviously , temperatures get extremely hot in the summer months , but can also get pretty chilly in the winter . The best time to go would be either in the spring ( March May ) or in the fall ( Sept- Nov ) . In theory , you can hike the trail year-round but expect to be sweating a lot in July and August and be prepared for cold nights in January and February ( you 'd have to pack extra clothes / warmer sleeping bags ) . November and December are the wettest months , expect lots of rain during those months . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire route , it will take you around 4 weeks . It is possible to walk only parts of the way . Depending on your hiking experience you might choose the eastern part for the tougher hike and the western part if you are not as experienced , since this is the easier section of the way . Some parts of the hike , especially close to Fethiye , are pretty strenuous . If you do n't want to camp , make sure to choose a part of the trail where you can sleep in guesthouses in village homes every night . It is possible to only hike sections of the trek , which is what most people do . <p> The most beautiful part of the trail is the hike between Fethiye and Patara . <h> How much does it cost ? <p> Traveling in Turkey is inexpensive ; you 'll be able to find a room for two in most guesthouses for about $20 , sometimes even less . A full meal including a drink in a restaurant in the less touristy places will cost you less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more popular tourist towns . You can buy a day 's ration of snacks and foods in a supermarket for about $10 . <p> The Lycian Way by Steynard on Flickr.com <h> What to pack <p> As you 'll be carrying all of your stuff with you at all times , it is essential to keep the weight as light as possible . In addition to your clothes and gear you 'll have to estimate another 3kg ( lbs ) for your daily food and water ration . <p> Key items include : <p> Walking boots with ankle support since parts of the way are rocky and steep <p> Camping gear ( because you will have to camp on some parts of the way ) This means at least a sleeping bag ( ideally lightweight ! ) , plus a tent of you want to be covered ( recommended because of occasional rains ) <p> A guidebook so that you can located the closest water sources , camp sites , etc.A cell phone with a local SIM card in case of an emergency <p> A torch , or even better a headlamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through areas without any shades for hours ) <p> A Turkish phrase book will come in handy since people in some of the remoter villages do not speak English <p> Mosquito repellent ( they come out at dawn for sure ) <p> Lycian Way village by Steynard on Flickr.com <h> Further reading <p> A British woman named Kate Clow was majorly involved in setting up the path in the early 2000s , making less known parts of it accessible for the public and establishing signage and other amenities along the path also wrote the most comprehensive book on the topic , including a detailed map of the trail .

Arenal , Costa Rica <p> I thought we knew Costa Rica up and down , except for the Osa Peninsula , which is a truly off-the-grid adventure deserving of its own dedicated trip . - Thats why , after our housesit on a small Costa Rican beach this year , we did n't  plan to travel much . We slipped in a short stint at one of our favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Arenal Volcano , which neither of us had been to yet . In a rare move for Central American travel , we rented a car and drove from the Pacific coast , through national parks and jungles , curved and swiveled around Lake Arenal and arrived in town , thinking the gorgeous ride would be the highlight of our stay . We could n't have been more wrong . We love everything about the set up in Arenal . Even though it has n't  erupted in years , the volcano is an imposing figure you cant miss from anywhere in town . At a certain point on the road out of town , practically every hotel has hot springs and we spent a day at the best choice of them all , Tabacon Grand Spa . There are massive waterfalls and a full range of day hikes around the volcano , depending on your level of fitness . Restaurants in town are overpriced tourist traps , but we opted to eat in the typical Costa Rican sodas which offer great value for money and the healthiest option in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This little city is not the first place you 'll hear about in Cambodia that would be the ancient kingdom of Angkor Wat outside of Siem Reap . You would probably also hear about Phnom Penh , the countrys capital and the beautiful coastline of the Sihanoukville area ( which we named one of the Top 5 favorite beaches we visited year ) . Somewhere further down the list is the sleepy city of Kampot , famous for its production of both salt and pepper . Kampot Pepper is served on the table of the finest restaurants in Paris , we were told on a day tour which brought us out to the salt fields , the pepper fields , a fishing village , and a gorgeous hike in the countryside . Everything in this quiet , riverside town is accessible by bicycle and the restaurant scene is surprisingly developed we had easily the best coffee of our time in Cambodia right here in Kampot. <h> 2 . Chiang Mai , Thailand <p> Popular with tourists and expats of all kinds , this northern Thai city has the magical ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is a far cry from buzzing , booming Bangkok . Both within the brick square mile of its more touristy city walls and out into the more local neighborhoods , Chiang Mai incorporates all the things we love about Thailand without most of the mess we disliked in the capital and down on some of the overrun islands . For example , the city is practically littered with ornate , peaceful Buddhist temples and monks in their orange robes- constantly- sweep past on motorbikes and bicycles , in tuk tuks and on foot , always with a smile that feels both insanely exotic and totally normal at the same time . And yet , Chiang Mai is also stocked with modern coffee shops , really fun walking markets , super fast internet , fashionable locals and online entrepreneeurs from all walks of life . Most of all , we ate like Kings in Chiang Mai . Organic , healthy food at under $4 a meal , fruit smoothies for under a dollaryes , we most definitely miss Chiang Mai <h> 1 . Buenos Aires , Argentina <p> Buenos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond anywhere else we visited this year . If you remember , I was n't even that impressed with the city when we landed there in November , as it reminded me of anywhere I 'd already loved in Europe Lisbon , Barcelona , Paris . So , it may have taken a little while for Buenos Aires to win us over . It did n't  do so overwhelmingly , or all at once . Instead , it seeped in slowlythe romance , the food , the culture , the architecture , the street art , the hot-blooded protestors , the complicated history and complex politics of isms and ists , the dinners at 11pm , even ( and I swore I would n't say this , but I am ) the accent that makes playa into plaisha , the rolling Italian speech rythyms and the hand gestures to match . The city is n't perfect , with garbage on the streets , corrupt politicians , and rates of inflation well never understand , but that only adds to the intrigue . Loving Buenos Aires was unexpected , but knowing it exists settles our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number one pick because it is the only place we say that you really have to go , a place where you could spend a year and not scratch the surface . It is definitely the city we visited in 2012 we could see ourselves returning to multiple times throughout our lives . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Miguel Any city in Europe during Christmas time is magical , I think ! But snow really adds something special . In Chiang Mai we had some of the best food on our travels and so cheap ! Definitely plan in a couple of days there ! = <p> Leanne you should ! Cafe Espresso is a great place to work and every other restaurant we tried in Kampot was fantastic , too . If you end up going , I will send some more recommendations your way = And yes Berlin is on our list for places to visit in 2013 for sure ! ! <p> I know I will get to Buenos Aires after reading of your experiences there . Your photos of Kampot remind me of Luang Prabang and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look forward to 2013 . <p> Thanks , Jan ! You are right there are similarities between Luang Prabang and Kampot . I guess that 's because they 're both former French colonies = The buildings look very similar , and both have an excellent coffee culture and such a relaxed vibe . And baguettes , of course ! ! = Happy New Year ! <p> Beautiful descriptions . Sometimes BA feels like a distant dream for me , although its somewhere I 'm very curious about . I just hear its dangerous or am I thinking of Rio ? Either way , its on the South American trail , where people say watch out for your wallet ( its not cheap ) &amp; watch out for your wallet ( it might get stolen ) . <p> Thanks , Christine ! People are saying that BA is becoming more and more dangerous , and there are a lot of pickpockets , but during the six weeks we spent there , nothing happened to us = And I think Rio is still more dangerous ! Totally agree with the watch out for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ btw ! We were surprised ( i.e. shocked ! ) how expensive BA was inflation is through the roof there ! <p> Hi travelgoddesses , Jess and Dani ! Even when we have n't met , I secretly travelled along to all the beautiful places , thanks to your pictures and more important your writings . Summer 2012 , my boyfriend and I travelled through Guatemala , Belize and a small part of Mexico . A lot of your tips where marvelous and useful , your blog was kind of a guide through our journey . ( Yellow house was indeed a winner ! ) We enjoyed the mix of the very cultural , colorful , urban life . With sometimes a little nature/adventure , but always safe enough to feel comfortable to relax and wander/wonder around . Were searching for a new destination in summer 2013 with in a way these same elements , but the choices our too many and too difficult . We sadly enough have only 3 weeks to travel , so maybe 1 ( far away ) country is enough for this year We 're maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no experience with this part of the world . What do you girls recommend for us starters to see a little bit of everything ( culture , beach , sun , food , nature , open people , ) in this period of time . And what about the rainy season ( half august , beginning of september ) ? Canada was an option but we fear there is not enough time to see it in a proper way Thanks a lot for your blog , your advice , and all your top favorites ! Sara and Pieter ( Belgium ) <p> Sara , your comment totally made our week ! Thanks so much for the kind words . We are so happy that you had a great trip trough Central America , too ! We have been brainstorming about your summer trip and will send you an email with some ideas = <p> I 'm really a big fan of Chiang Mai . In all the times I have been there , I always find something new and interesting to do . I 'm considering moving up there full time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March-April because they burn all the fields . <p> Buenos Aires is the only city I 've visited on this list , but I could n't agree more ! of course , the rest are high up on the list as well , but I need to wait a little longer before I finally make it over to Asia or C. America . great blog ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143225 @2543225/ <h> Life lately and upcoming travels : July 2014 Edition <p> We used to look back at our travels and reflect on them every one hundred days , but I have n't done that in a while . I decided to revive these reflections sort of by starting a new segment in which I 'll tell you what I 've been up to lately , how I have been feeling while I 've been processing the end of my relationship and how my transformation into a solo traveler is going , plus what 's next on my travel agenda. - <h> Life lately <p> I feel like its been forever since I wrote my last personal update but that wasnt even three months ago . Its funny how much can happen in such little time , how much can change . <p> City That Does Not Sleep ( Ciudad sin sue+o ) by Federico Garcia Lorca <p> But let 's start at the beginning . I am still in New York , something I had n't  planned at all when I boarded my flight to JFK in May . It only took me about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though my time in New York started with a disaster . The housesit I came here for fell trough unexpectedly ( the owner got sick and canceled her trip ) and I had to find a place to stay within 48 hours . If you 've ever been apartment hunting in NYC , you know that this pretty much impossible . By the end of a full day of room searching , I had exactly ONE lead . But that one , even though it seemed dodgy to meet someone off a Craigslist ad at 10.30 at night , worked out , and it even was on the Upper West Side , the same neighborhood I was supposed to housesit in . Looking back , it was a blessing . I ended up living with two lovely girls for a month who were extremely supportive , always had an open ear and became more than just room mates . It was probably a good thing that I was n't living by myself at the time when I was going through some major grieving . <p> I found another sublet in June and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell head over heels in love with , with a German girl ( small world ! ) who I got along with really well . After having an eventful and uplifting first month here and learning how easy it was to find sublets during the summer , I made the decision to extend my stay . I even ended up finding two housesits for this month , plus two more for next month , which meant I got to explore two more new neighborhoods and spend some time with a beautiful dog and a lovely cuddle cat . <p> The best thing about living on the Upper West Side : Having Central Park right next door ! <p> If you 're following me on Instagram or read my Polaroid posts every week , you already know that Ive been keeping myself super busy over the last few weeks : from the time-intense soccer world cup ( can I just say again WE ARE WORLD CHAMPIONS ! ! ) and the eccentric Mermaid Parade to al fresco opera and cinema events and an unforgettable 4th July rooftop BBQ , I 've barely had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer here than I could possibly fit in and I love that I am able to experience over 100 days of spring and summer in New York City . <h> Closing a chapter <p> Emotionally , the past few weeks have been a roller coaster . I worked through my breakup and was finally able to close that chapter . The realizations I 've had during my long runs through New York helped me to see that this was in fact the right decision and that the relationship would n't have lasted in the long run . I learned a lot about myself , and I also grew stronger . Having to face business decisions and issues by myself made me a much tougher person , especially when it comes to decision making and vision developing . Not having anyone to talk things trough with or to hide behind in a business meeting forced me to wear more hats than I thought I was capable of . <p> Many good things also happened ; things that would n't have happened for me if Jess and I were still together . Sometimes change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to agree with her . While this was a scary and unknown path at first , I am now embracing the freedom I have and the challenges I am able to take on . Just last week I had a business meeting that I would have never even accepted before , and now I am more than determined to make this collaboration happen . I have not only grown stronger , I have also developed an improved self esteem . <p> I have to thank New York for a lot , and in a way , I have to thank Jess for a lot . By leaving she made me push the boundaries , push myself to work harder , get out of my comfort zone and take 100 % control over all of my actions . <h> Exciting travel plans ! <p> Now on to the most exciting news : upcoming travel plans ! After having lost my wanderlust for a while , I am happy to report that I 've got itchy feet again and am up to my ears in travel planning and preparations at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to Canada , but apart from my short beach getaway that was the only time I 've left New York City since I got here and I am more than ready for a break from the city ! <p> I am about to fly up to Buffalo and Niagara Falls to get to know Buffalos art and architecture scene as well as its foodie culture over the next few days , both of which I 've been told are amazing . During our quick stint in Buffalo in 2011 we did n't  see much more than a restaurant someone had recommended to us , and I just recently found out that Buffalo is a home to several Frank Lloyd Wright buildings which I 'll be visiting . Also on my agenda : the- Albright-Knox Art Gallery , one of only three places in the state of New York that has a Frida Kahlo painting ( one of my favorite artists ) , in addition to countless other renowned artists . I am looking forward to- contemporary art , getting to know some of the citys neighborhoods and of course Niagara Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during our two-month visit to Canada three years ago because I left my passport in Ottawa , I am stoked to finally see the Falls from the American side . <p> You can follow my adventures in Buffalo and Niagara Falls over the next few days on Instagram and Facebook . <p> Niagara Falls from Canada , 2011 <p> Once I return to New York from Buffalo , I 'll have only five weeks left in New York and I basically have my entire remaining time already mapped out . There is just too much to do and to see in New York " I will never get around to ticking everything off my list . I hope I 'll find time for another getaway upstate or the beach , and I will have friends come visit me here . <p> I wo n't have time to rest when I leave New York " I 'll head straight into my next adventure , which involves a big trek .

I will reveal more details as soon as everything is set in stone but no matter which plan will work out , either one will involve a major hike .

I 've made a documentation project of various Buffalo things-to-do-and-see when I realized my time in Buffalo was numbered : you can find them here . Personally , though , I recommend Elmwood for the vibe , and Allentown for the nightlife . <p> If I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fridays , and the gallery across the street ( Birchfield Penny I think ) is new and worth checking out . And check if you can get in the Buffalo Asylum ; when I was there , only the exterior was accessible due to safety concerns , but I have heard that they were renovating the inside and had plans on letting the public inside again . <p> In any case , Buffalo is indeed more than just the falls and wings . I hope you 'll have a good time there . I am heading there myself during the last week of August for a conference and I cant wait to be back . = <p> Jeruen thanks so much for all the tips ! Elmwood and Allentown are great , I love especially Allentown ! ! The Albright-Knox Gallery knocked my socks off , I had no idea I 'd see so many world class painters displayed here !

@@107143226 @2543226/ <h> Arizona The Road Trip Capital of the World <p> Massive in size , covered in incredible scenery and dotted with tiny towns and major cities , the United States is truly a road-trippers dream , and after our experience , we think that everyone should go on an American road trip at least once in their lives . <p> Every time we visit we try to fit in at least one road trip and have driven thousands of miles driving up and down and across the country . Our last road trip , NYC2NOLA , spanned from New York to New Orleans , and our whole GlobtrotterGirls experience essentially kicked off with a trip up and down the Pacific Coast Highway from San Francisco to San Diego . We followed that up just a month or so later with the mother of all road trip roads , Route 66 , complete with its cowboys , the Grand Canyon and riding through the Wild , Wild West . <p> For Dani , driving across America is super inspiring as she has wanted to live in America for over decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could have been like to be a cheerleader , her dream of living the American Dream does n't  fade . In fact , she has even entered the annual Green Card Lottery a handful of times , hoping to be one of the 55,000 lucky ones who win a green card ever year . <p> Part of what fascinates Dani and also myself , is the incredible variation of landscapes across the country . Glaciers in Alaska , the Rocky Mountains , the desert . In fact , the state of Arizona incorporates so much of that variation within the borders of that one state . The moonscape of the Painted Desert , the unique boulders and rock formations of Monument Valley , the Grand Canyon , the lesser known but seriously stunning Canyon de Chelly as well as the jaw-dropping Antelope Canyon.We saw the wild Sonoran desert , visited a ghost mining town and Indian Trading Posts , experienced a rodeo in Prescott , marveled at the red rocks of Sedona , and finally drove along the iconic Route 66 before heading west to Nevada . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we made several rookie mistakes on our first big road trip and because we make mistakes so that you do n't  have to , we have put together our five main tips for a successful road trip : <h> Our tips for an Arizona road trip : <p> 1 . Map out your route before you go . Knowing exactly what was on our agenda for the next day and the day after helped us to stay focused and plan our exact route , which was extremely helpful when booking hotels and motels " which brings us to #2 <p> 2 . Book your motels and hotels in advance. - It seems romantic to just pull up , park and check-in , but accommodation fills up quickly , leaving you with some of the less-desirable options especially in popular spots like Flagstaff , the base for Grand Canyon explorations , where hotels and motels tend to fill up quickly , especially during vacation times . In Chinle , the closest town to Canyon de Chelly , there were only a couple of motels with the next accommodation hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we had n't booked in advance . In the towns where we booked prior to arrival , we always got a better deal using hotel comparison websites . <p> 3 . Plan in an extra couple of hours for each day of driving.Booking some accommodation in advance does n't  mean you 'll have to rush through places if you plan in extra hours on the road from the start . We found ourselves stopping at scenic lookouts or just on the side of the road in little towns much more often than we had thought , which extended our driving time extensively . We spend some days entirely in the car . <p> 4 . Have your documents on you at all timesThis is true especially in border states . In Arizona , it is state law that foreign visitors have to have a valid I.D . on them at all times . Dani did n't bring her passport on one of our explorations and almost got in trouble with the border immigration control because of it . Expect to be stopped by police several times , particular in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican border . <p> 5 . Pack some healthy snacks . We found that on several of the long drives , between Monument Valley and Page for example , or Page and Flagstaff , there was a noticeable absence of restaurant and stores , except for mini marts and fast food chains " not the healthiest food for a road trip . Having enough apples , nuts and water in the car was a lifesaver on several occasions . <h> 4 Comments <p> If you are a long term traveler and are doing a road trip , plan ahead by owning your own wheels and house on your back . <p> I 've driven around Europe for six months in a VW camper van that I owned . I 've also taken a year to drive to Costa Rica , R/T from California in a pick-up truck with a camper on the back . <p> If you 're thinking of a year or so , you can easily sell your rig for near what you paid for it at the end of your trip . That equals zero cost ! Compare what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-home cooked meals to : the cost of your vehicle ( gas , a few oil changes , a flat tire or two , license and insurance ) , no lodging except for maybe paying for Campgrounds with hook-ups for half the time ( way cheaper than motels ) and the ability to buy good food and cook your own meals . <p> Plus , you have the freedom to go where you want , when you want , always knowing that wherever you are , you 're home . You do n't  have to make reservations ahead of time and then have to meet a schedule to be there . <p> I 've done this and kept track of costs . Its a no-brainer ! The only downside is that you 'll have to have the up front money required to buy your home on wheels . <p> Its interesting that this mode of travel is not covered in any travel books , guides or blogs . So , if you 're thinking about a long term road trip , be smart and do the math and maybe work and save a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . <p> Steve you have done some amazing road trips ! Driving a camper van through Australia is on our bucket list = You are right about the costs , too when we rented a car for the first time for a month , it was only $520 when we tried to find a deal like that the second time around , we had no success and paid double that rate ! With gas and motel costs it really adds up and I think a camper van is just perfect to save on accommodation costs and to stop where ever you want for however long you want . I hope well get to do this one day in the U.S. , too there is just so much to see ! ! <p> We did a fantastic road trip around the Southwestern states of America a year ago . We did n't  get too far off the beaten path just the grand canyon , Sedona , Flagstaff and Scottsdale/Phoenix . I 'd love to see more . <p> Bethaney is n't it just such a beautiful part of the U.S. ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to going back = We tried to see the Wave ( google image search The Wave Arizona , its stunning ) but they limited the daily visitors and you can win a day pass to hike there we drove two hours out there and took part in the lottery but did n't  win .

@@107143227 @2543227/ <h> Top five places to see the fall colors in New England <p> Summer is almost here , which means I can finally get started on my autumn travel plans ! You might remember that last year after returning to New York I tried to finally make it up to New England to see the spectacular autumn colors up there , a trip I had on my travel wish list for many years . However , I never made it beyond Upstate New York last fall , which turned out to be a beautiful , colorful trip nonetheless , but left me still longing for the New England fall colors , which are said to be the most vibrant ones.Especially Vermont , where you find many maple trees , whose leaves turn into a striking scarlet color in the fall , is a must for anyone who loves the feeling of fall , and I hope 2016 is the year where I 'll finally get to experience the much talked about New England fall colors . These small states in the north east of the US ( Vermont , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island ) , named after the 17th century English settlements , do not only offer breathtaking fall colors , by the way , but also some of the quaintest coastal towns in the US , the quintessential small town feel and gorgeous landscapes , and thanks to their compact size , can easily be combined into one trip . This part of the US is not only popular with Americans during that time " people flock here from all over the world in the fall , there are even British companies that offer organized trips to experience the beauty of the autumn colours in New England.I have put together a list of the top five places to see the fall colors in New England must visit destination for any passionate leaf peeper : <h> 1 The Green Mountain Byway ( Vermont Route 100 ) , Vermont <p> Vermont is every leaf peeper 's dream come true : 80% of the state are covered in forest , making for an explosion of colors in the fall that begs to be photographed . The Green Mountain Byway is a scenic byway that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the maple leaves reach their brightest scarlet . The road goes past mountains and farms , through Green Mountain National Forest , and connects the picturesque small towns of Stowe and Waterbury , which are both worth a stop . <h> 2 The White Mountains , New Hampshire <p> In New Hampshire , the White Mountains make for an unforgettable road trip with views of the Presidential Range and Mount Washington , which is New England 's highest peak at 6,288ft . There are stunningly beautiful vistas at every turn of the winding road , and along the way you can eat in small , family-run restaurants and sleep in charming , old-fashioned inns . The most famous roads here are Route 302 , which passes through Crawford Notch , a beautiful valley where yellow-leafed birches and scarlet-colored maple leaves are perched along the hillsides , and the Kancamagus Highway ( Route 112 ) , a scenic byway that crosses the White Mountains from East to West . <h> 3 The Mohawk Trail , Massachusetts <p> The winding roads of the Mohawk Trail in western Massachusetts offer some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite busy during the weekends in October , but that 's for a reason ! The Mohawk Trail goes through the Berkshires and offers an array of trees that will leave you in awe for sure : birch , maples , beech , ash , dogwood , oak , sassafras and tulip trees all contribute to a colorful leaf cover along the road . In addition to the fall colors , artsy small towns contribute to the charming atmosphere of this region " make sure to stop in North Adams , which even has a Fall Foliage Festival each year in early October , stop in historic Greenfield where the 3-story lookout at the Poet 's Seat Tower provides magnificent vistas , and take a short detour in Charlemont to the impressive Bissell Covered Bridge . <h> 4 Route 7 , Connecticut <p> Route 7 is the main north-south artery through western New England , and 78 miles of the 313 mile long route go through Connecticut . The most scenic part starts in New Milford , going north . The town of Kent has been voted the Number One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , and not far from there , Kent Falls State Park in Litchfield County offers a short , but lovely hike to a 250 feet tall waterfall , which is even more striking when it is surrounded by brilliant autumn colors . Make sure to stop at the West Cornwall Covered Bridge further north , and in Litchfield , a delightful little town with art galleries , restaurants and coffee shops worth a visit . <h> 5 Acadia National Park , Maine <p> Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island . No matter where you find yourself in the park , you 'll be wowed by unforgettable vistas of the rocky coastline , the mountains , little lakes and lush forests . Mount Desert Island is famous for its historic carriage paths " make sure to plan in time for a stroll along these trails as well as a visit to Seal Cove , Northeast Harbor , Southwest Harbor and Bar Harbor , all located on the island .

I took a break on Thursday to finally enjoy an outdoor movie one of the 28 things I love about summer in New York City are the free outdoor movies all over the city and couldnt have chosen a better time for a break away from my laptop : a beautiful summer night , A League Of Their Own , good company , a lovely picnic and watching the sunset over the Manhattan skyline . <p> That night was a nice walk down memory lane in three different ways : This Used To Be My Playground , the theme song of the movie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her music ( I liked her 80s stuff , but it was a bit too pop-y for me ) , and was the song that started her ballad phase over the next couple of years , she would release some of my all-time Madonna songs , like Rain , Secret , I 'll Remember , Take A Bow , and finally Youll See , which might be my all-time favorite song of hers . <p> The other way related to the movie that I was strolling down memory lane : Some of the baseball scenes were filmed in Wrigley Field , Chicagos famous baseball stadium which dates back to 1914 and is one of the oldest baseball parks in the U.S. , which is why it was a perfect location for the movie which was set in the 1940s .

Back then , I would have never thought that it would take me nearly five years to return , because London has always been one of my favorite cites in the world .

@@107143230 @2543230/ <h> 14 things we love about Uruguay <p> Two weeks in this small South American country might seem like enough , but once you get comfortable and ease into the way of life here , you could easily get sucked in for a few months . Between beach-hopping , checking out Montevideo , the capital , and hitting up so so cute colonial towns we fell head over heels in love with Uruguay . Weve put together a list of fourteen things we love , one for each day we spent in Uruguay . <h> 1 Punta del diablo <p> This was our favorite beach town in Uruguay . We were here just after high season , so the tourist swell gave way to the sleepy fisherman 's wharf feeling it has the other ten months a year . We loved the architecture of the homes here , and the sand dunes piled high along the roads near the beach . <h> 2 Dia de +oquis Gnocchi Day ! <p> The influence of Italian immigrants throughout South America make dishes like pizza and pasta commonplace , but the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every month has us hooked as Jess prefers gnocchi to any Italian dish . <p> Spinach Gnocchi <h> 3 Colonial towns <p> We loved the colonial little towns throughout the country each and every one was picture-perfect with pastel-colored houses , a well-manufactured town square and cobble-stone streets , with Colonia del Sacramento being the most popular colonial town in all of Uruguay . <h> 4 The gaucho culture <p> Uruguay remains a very traditional country with a strong gaucho ( cowboy ) culture . Even though we hung mostly near the coasts , we loved coming across this culture here and next time we will spend more time inland exploring this as well . <h> 5 Medio y medio <p> This traditional and refreshing Uruguayan wine is simply a half-half mix of one part sweet sparkling wine cut with an equal part dry white wine delicious ! <h> 6 Beaches <p> Uruguay has miles and miles of coastline and dozens of beautiful beaches . The capital , Montevideo , is surrounded by coastline , which then extends the entire way to the border with Brazil . <h> 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Wi-Fi that actually works . In Argentina or Chile , where bus rides last ten hours or more , the advertised wi-fi is little more than watching the symbol swirl as it attempts to connect . In Uruguay , rides are usually three hours or less , so you might have less time but you can get online to check emails , read , work or tweet while you drive . <h> 8 Mate obsession <p> We knew that Argentina was obsessed with the herbal drink Mate , but that is nothing compared to the Uruguayans addiction . People carry a large thermos in the crux of one arm and their mate gourd in the other everywhere they go with others carry leather bags specifically made to carry mate but no one seriously no one leaves home without their thermos and their gourd. <h> 9 Vintage cars <h> 10 Gay-friendly <p> The country is surprisingly gay-friendly . As the 14th country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage , we saw open displays of affection between gay couples even on the street and there is even a Plaza for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ del Este <p> Even though Uruguay is on the east coast of the continent , Punta del Este sits on a cape , allowing amazing sunsets to be seen from the stretches of west-facing beaches here . <h> 12 The laidback vibe <p> Beaches , hippies , free health care , low crime rates , decriminalized marijuana laws take your pick but all of them combine to make Uruguay easily one of the most laid-back countries in South America . <h> 13 The lighthouses <p> Uruguay has over 15 lighthouses along the coastline , most of which date back to the late 1800s . We climbed up to the top of various bright white lighthouses for expansive views of the coastline . Those with a fear of heights should still climb the hundreds of stairs once you get the the top you really appreciate the combination of an old world feel with the beautiful beaches in view . <p> This hostel in Punta Del Diablo was our favorite accommodation in all of Uruguay . We extended our stay from two days to four ! We felt right at home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean kitchen with everything necessary to cook , plus a swimming pool , comfortable beds and delicious Uruguayan breakfasts ( which are still bread and jam , but the bread was huge and the jams were homemade ) . <p> Planning a trip to Uruguay ?

Who knew it would take us almost four years to actually make it here ! <p> Last week we arrived in Cuzco and immediately started researching options for hopping on the traditional Inca Trail trek , which is usually sold out months in advance . In reality , we found several agencies with spots open with just a few days notice . Our research led us to the Salkantay Trek , a lesser known , less crowded alternative to the Inca Trail . We spontaneously decided to sign up for that 5-day trek instead of the 4-day Inca Trail our first ever multi-day trek ! Even though the trek was strenuous 73 kilometers ( 45 miles ) up and down the Andes , with up to 10 hours hiking per day , it was the absolute best way to arrive at Machu Picchu . <p> You see images of Machu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual site might feel almost anticlimactic . There was no need to worry we were blown away by the majestic city . Set on a steep mountain top , over 85% remains in tact after 500 years ! Just to reach the site from Aguas Calientes was humbling : one hour straight of climbing steep steps at 5am . As if that wasnt enough , we climbed even steeper steps for another hour even further up to the top of Huayna Picchu , the huge mountain that prominently features in most Machu Picchu images . From there , we had the best views over the ancient city in its entity , even though the climb along narrow and uneven steps cut into the rocks was terrifying ! <p> The five-day trek and Machu Picchu itself are huge highlights of all our travels , and we cant wait to share more details about both soon ! 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 16 Comments <p> I 'm so envious right now !

On the whole , I think Bob enjoyed the whole trekking experience more than I did . But he likes that sort of thing .

@@107143233 @2543233/ <h> How to save money for travel quickly <p> I get a lot of emails from readers asking me questions about specific destinations , traveling as a woman by myself , or practical information like how I deal with proof of onward travel requirements . But the question I get the most ? How I afford my travels , and how I saved up for my trip before I left the UK . What I realize is that most people do n't  want to save up for years and years , but want to fulfill their dream of traveling the world as quickly as possible . I only saved money for about 3 months before leaving on my journey , which back then I thought would last a year , and not six years ( so far ! ) . I met a traveler in Colombia last month who saved up only G6,000 Euros in only three months , through work and selling his car . And he s been traveling for nearly a year now , on that little money ! A friend of mine from the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Asia . You see that it is possible to save money for quickly in a short period of time.If you are really determined to make it happen , you can save up money in a few short months- and here are some tips how to do it : <h> Make a budget &amp; set saving goals <p> How do you know how much you can actually save if you do n't  know how much you 're spending ? Or what you 're wasting money on ? Start with an overview of your daily and monthly expenses . Then see where you can cut down costs . Which bills are really necessary ? Take cable for example , which averages $100 a month . Do you really need it ? Maybe you can get by with Netflix for a while , which is less than $10 a month . You can watch almost anything for free online these days anyway . <p> Or your phone plan some of my friends pay $80 a month for their cell phone , which is a lot of money ! My phone plan in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text , 100 minutes talk time , and most importantly : unlimited web . <p> Do you really make good use of your gym membership or can you do- yoga at home instead or run outside ? <p> And then there are your daily expenses . Do you really need a $5 Latte every day or can you do without one for a while , knowing that $5 will buy you 3 meals in India ? Or do you have an expensive juice habit like me ? I could n't afford the $7 or $8 green smoothies every day , and so I bought a small blender that is a take-away cup at the same time . The blender was $15 , and now I spend about $10 a week on spinach and veggies instead of $50 a week on smoothies from a juice bar . I started bringing packed lunches instead of wasting money on overpriced sandwiches or salads . Other things I stopped buying : clothes , books , magazines , cake ( another expensive habit of mine coffee shops that serve good cake ! ) . I limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and looked for groupons or cheap lunch deals . Cooking more often will save you so much money . I love going to the movies , but I found a movie theater with a special -3 admission day what a difference to the usual admission of -12 or more ! <p> Make a spreadsheet and list all your expenses , see which costs you can cut down , set realistic savings goals and make sure to transfer every dollar you save in a separate savings account right away . The key to successful money saving is to actually monitor your spending and to be willing to make changes in your spending habits . <h> Extra income <p> Picking up an additional job is of course a good idea to achieve your savings goal , but there are lots of ways to make an extra income " I am going to separate between active and passive income . <p> Depending on your current job , you might be able to pick up a seasonal job " for example in the service industry if you live in a touristy spot like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of summer jobs open up along the beaches during the summer months . Check Craigslist for jobs in your area , ask on Facebook if anyone in your circle of friends knows of a suitable job . <p> If you have a knack for picking good investment opportunities , you might want to try your luck in trading or day trading , which can be a way to earn an extra income quickly , and keep making extra money while on the road . You do n't have to be a genius to trade stocks and I 've met quite a few travelers who were trading stocks online while on the road " most recently a girl from the UK who did n't have a finance background whatsoever and told me she learned the basics of trading through Youtube tutorials and by reading up on it on the internet . Websites like Binary Uno let you trade options and also offer a variety of online trading courses and strategies . <p> If you do n't feel comfortable trading options or stocks and do n't have any possibilities to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask around in your circle of family and friends if anybody needs help cleaning out their garage , doing yard work , walking the dog , or other simple tasks . <p> And then there are jobs you can do online " when I started out freelancing , I uploaded my CV and skill set on all kinds of online freelance websites such as PeoplePerHour , eLance and UpWork . If you have creative / design / writing skills like online marketing , copy writing , translating , graphic design or web design , to name just a few , you should look into giving these sites a try " I 've also used them while traveling to maintain a steady income . <p> Passive income <p> You do n't even have to invest hours of work time to make an extra income " you could also have a passive income , thanks to the booming sharing economy . Got a spare room ? Rent it out on AirBnb . Do n't need your car ? Sign up for Flightcar and let other people use it ( no worries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time to make a few extra dollars " become an Uber driver if you feel comfortable chauffeuring people around your city , cook a meal for strangers if you enjoy cooking and get paid for it , thanks to websites like EatWith . There are so many options now to make money thanks to the sharing economy , and I used to rent out my extra room in London , using the money I earned that way for travel . <h> Start travel hacking <p> The most expensive aspect of traveling is usually the flight " but would n't it be great if you could fly for free ? Well , you actually can ! I 've talked about how to get started with travel hacking- before but I ca n't stress it enough : apply for a rewards credit card and use it for all your purchases . You earn at least 1 point per dollar , and for certain purchases even 2 points per dollar , and trust me " these points add up quickly ! The best part about these reward credit cards ? The sign-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards and the benefits of each one , and most importantly : how many points you get for signing up for them . The sign-up bonus is usually between 30,000 and 50,000 points and with that many points , you can easily pay for your flights . The sign-up bonus will be credited into your account after spending a certain amount " around $3,000 " within three months of signing up . If this number seems high to you " when you think about all your bills and expenses , it 's actually not hard at all to spend that kind of money . <p> To find out more about rewards credit cards , check out ThePointsGuy or Nerdwallet , where you find the best current credit card offers and a ton of tips on how to use them in the most effective way . <h> Sell stuff you do n't need <p> Everybody has stuff in their house that they do n't use or need " but most people are too lazy to sell it .

Usually I dread visiting Erfurt , the town I grew up in , because if there is such a thing as growing apart from your hometown , then I have certainly experienced it .

@@107143236 @2543236/ <h> Barefoot and Breezy : Beachfront Thai cooking at Time for Lime on Koh Lanta <p> . I do n't expect to be wielding a pencil during a cooking course , but that is exactly the tool I find in my hand for the first hour of my Time for Lime course on the island of Koh Lanta , Thailand . Our teacher Junie , who was born in the States and grew up in Norway , has been cooking Thai food for the past 25 years , nine of which spent at Time for Lime , her breezy beachfront restaurant here on one of Thailand 's more laid-back southern islands . <p> We arrive via the restaurant 's pick up service , slip off our sandals as is customary in Thailand , and make our way to the beach bar to meet the other five students for the day : - a Swedish couple , a friendly couple escaping chilly London and a solo German traveler . After sharing an exotic drink and some small talk , we are seated at one of the restaurant tables , nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thai food is all in the preparation <p> Immediately I am glad we chose Time for Lime over the other options on the island . Junie understands the complexities of Thai food preparation like a native , but is able to explain them to a bunch of foreigners in a way we can understand . She takes nothing for granted , and starts the course by teaching us the basics . Really , this course is all about food preparation , not cooking , as the former can take hours , the latter just minutes . <p> I find it hard not to gaze out at the late afternoon sun over the ocean , but I quickly focus as we learn our first lesson about flavor balance in Thai cooking . Thai food requires a balance of salt , sweet , sour and spicy which is why in Thailand , instead of our salt , pepper and ketchup on the table , here you find a set of four covered glasses with soy sauce or peanuts , chili peppers , a spicy sauce , brown sugar and then lime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly flavorful this balance can be , we taste our first Thai snack " and its nothing like the spring rolls I know from home.Folding a leaf into a cone , we sprinkle a pinch of peanut , ginger , onion , coconut , chili ( shrimp for the omnivores ) , drizzle honey over it and fold it up into a little edible leaf parcel , creating a popular Thai snack called Mieng Kham . Then , as Junie eats it , we follow suit . My mouth is instantly bursting with flavor , each and every taste bud alive after a cubic inch of just the essential Thai condiments . <h> Slice , dice , smash and pound : put to work in the kitchen <p> After an hour of abstract learning , we are handed our Time for Lime cooking aprons and move over to the open kitchen for a chance to use these knives ourselves . Individual cooking stations are set up in a square around the outside of the space each with a burner , a wok of our own , and all the utensils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the center , which is filled with trays overflowing with colorful , fresh ingredients we learn to chop , slice , smash and dice . <p> The first task is also the most difficult : green curry paste . We are each in charge of one ingredient , which , when we finish cutting it , we take turns mashing it down using the heavy mortar and pestle . The entire process takes 45 minutes , so after ten minutes , a few of the staff on hand ( there are about ten Thai ladies surrounding the scene ) take over and we move on to the next dish.As quickly as we make a mess , these women efficiently move in like a racing car pit crew to clean up and put down the next ingredients before we 've even noticed . With our own work station , we are free to make our food vegetarian , and Junies helpers make plenty of tofu available . <p> In just under 30 minutes , we have prepared and creatively plated two dishes " the green curry and a lemongrass salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less time . <p> Back in the kitchen , I can already feel the confidence level soaring as I am preparing the ingredients , so I am slightly disappointed to discover that fried rice is the next dish . However , unlike its greasy Chinese cousin , we discover Thai fried rice to be fresh and delicious , speed cooked in a wok with just a bit of egg thrown in at the end . Despite her love of spicy coconut curries , Thai fried rice becomes Dani 's go-to dish for the rest of our time in Thailand . <h> Why were here : Lanta Animal Welfare <p> After a second lengthy instruction on ingredient prep , the rice and the vegetable stir-fry dishes take another twenty minutes to cook and plate . And while we were stuffing ourselves silly , Junie melts our hearts by bringing out three puppies she discovered in the forest the day before . Of course , we had expected something like this to happen and it 's the reason we chose Time for Lime 's cooking course . Junie runs the island 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweat , tears and dump trucks full of gumption , Junie managed to get the shelter off the ground in 2003 , rescuing hundreds of abused dogs ( and cats ) . All proceeds from the Time for Lime restaurant , cooking course and bungalows go toward the shelter and just this past year , Lanta Animal Welfare moved in to an excellent new facility in the center of the island . <p> Eventually , after the puppies have long since fallen asleep in our laps , we slip our shoes back on and hop in the truck to be taken back to our respective hotels , as knackered as the puppies . That 's not to say we do n't leave fully satisfied . Both stuffed to the gills with four delicious Thai dishes , plus we feel truly educated in Thai cuisine and proud for helping support such a worthy cause , which means a lot to us animal lovers . <p> Notes on the Cooking Class : Cooking classes run once a day , and the menu changes daily , so check the Time for Lime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn to cook. - The class runs from 4pm to 10pm and includes the introduction to Thai cooking , making a curry paste , 4 dishes , rice , and a dessert . The first class is 1800 Baht , with discounts available if you take more than one class . You can book a class online or directly at the Time for Lime restaurant . <p> Notes on Lanta Animal Welfare : We visited the animal shelter and were impressed by the top quality facility . For those who would like to help , the website takes donations . Travelers can volunteer and stay for free at on-site dorms for anywhere from a few weeks to a few months . <h> 30 Comments <p> Looks like a fun experience and it sounds like you learned a lot about Thai cooking . While I was there , although I was in the South , I grew an affinity for Itaan ( I think that 's the right spelling ) food from the Northern regions . The sticky rice is a favorite . <p> I 'm definitely going to have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks Fidel = Sticky rice is one of our favorites , too ! We loved the way it was served in Laos just sticky rice with a delicious chili sauce . And Sticky Rice with Mango is my absolute favorite Thai desert ! Thailand is a great place for a cooking class there are so many cooking schools in Chiang Mai where you can learn how to make the Northern specialties , you should do it there = <p> That sounds like so much fun . And its the perfect travel experience you can actually take home and use even though finding the right ingredients might be difficult . I 've always wanted to take a cooking class while travelling , but have never had the time or been at the right place or found a place that offers this type of experience . Its on my list though ! <p> Absolutely ! We cant wait to have a kitchen and try the recipes at home ! Well be housesitting in Thailand for the next few weeks looking forward to go to the market , pick up fresh vegetables and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day = <p> Highly recommend this one ! We love cooking classes too , and every time we take one I wish we had a kitchen to actually make the dishes we learned to make at home . By the time we settle down well probably have forgotten everything = <p> Thank you , Bret ! You are right making the food is actually a lot of work . The preparation can take hours , depending on which dishes you 're making . But when we finally sat down and ate , it was so delicious well worth the effort ! <p> Thanks Cherina ! Thai is one our favorite cuisines as well so happy that now were able to make some of the dishes we love most at home = Only a cooking class in Italy can beat that I wish we 'd have taken one when we were there last year ! I am sure you will LOVE it ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143239 @2543239/ <h> Happy anniversary ! Today we celebrate one year on the road <p> We GlobetrotterGirls are celebrating our first travel anniversary today ! On 30 April 2010 we boarded a plane from London to Las Vegas , where we started our round-the-world adventure . We might still be far from getting around the entire globe , but we have traveled quite a bit in the last 12 months as digital nomads and have no plan to stop any time soon . <p> 13 countries might not be a lot , especially when compared to many people who squeeze more than 20 countries into their round-the-world trips . However , we found we prefer slow travel , as we combine travel with a full-time workload , have an unlimited amount of time and are not bound to a tight itinerary . In fact we are in Europe right now and had no plans to visit here at all in 2011 , but an amazing housesitting opportunity came up in Germany which led to our stay at a beautiful country house Italy right now ( in fact another housesit ) ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow globetrotter Wandering Earl who , after examining how many beds he had slept in over the past 11 years , asked the question- How many beds have you slept in ? ' , we started to think how many beds have we slept in over the last 365 days ? <p> We have slept in 104 beds ! That , plus 3 nights spent on overnight buses , comes out to an average of one new bed every 3.5 days . Of course we had much longer stays in some places and shorter stays in others , but we sure moved around a lot this past year . We have already made a pledge to slow down our travel pace in our second year as digital nomads , so that we will not get burnt out from being on the move all the time . <p> While we were counting , we also added up all the different types of long distance transportation that we took ( not including inner-city travel ) : <p> Our preferred method of transport has been by local bus . Rather than paying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively by local bus from town to town , and this meant a lot of changing buses . It may have taken a bit longer , but we would n't have had it any other way . <p> We were surprised to see how many boats we boarded in Central America . These were mostly dubious little wooden motor boats , and we were never sure whether our belongings ( or ourselves ! ) would arrive to the next destination. - However , despite motors choking out in the middle of the ocean and stories of capsized boats , we personally survived all the boat rides to all the islands and lake towns we visited , unlike fellow traveler Adventurous Kate 's recent horrific Indonesian shipwreck experience . <h> Our top 5 places of the last year <p> We have already summarized our Tops &amp; Flops , favorite places and top food moments in our 100 days ' reflection posts , but here are our favorites of the entire year ( in no particular order ! ) <p> - - - San Francisco , USA The city by the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southwestern US and California . - - - San Pedro La Laguna , Guatemala We enjoyed the relaxed vibe and international cuisine with spectacular views of Lake Atitlan. - - - Leon , Nicaragua Leon 's no gem , and that 's what we love about it ! - - - Playa del Carmen , Mexico We stayed in Playa for one month last September , way up on 88th street far from the popular tourist center , with our stretch of white sand beach nearly deserted for us alone to play in the crystal clear water . - - - Tuscany , Italy The dream of housesitting in an Italian country house in Tuscany came true and we are spending our travel anniversary exploring little Italian towns ! <h> Our top 5 foods <p> - - - Central American pineapples At times we were eating at least one pineapple every single day . The sweet and juicy Central American pineapples are so cheap and delicious ! - - - Gallo Pinto in Nicaragua and Costa Rica We ate this popular rice and beans ' breakfast dish every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! - - - Pupusas in El Salvador Even though the variety of vegetarian pupusas ( cheese , cheese &amp; refried beans , or just refried beans ) was n't huge , we had dozens of pupusas during our stay in El Salvador . Pupusas are an incredibly cheap meal at $0.20 " $0.40 each . - - - Mexican Tacos and Flautas We loved Mexican street food , and the tacos and flautas ( especially potato tacos/flautas ) were something that would make us consider moving to Mexico . - - - Italian food everywhere ! This is not exclusive to Tuscany ( where we are currently enjoying pizza and pasta daily ) . We were lucky enough to find excellent Italian cuisine in restaurants all over Central America , run by Italian expats who satisfied our never ending hunger for thin-crust pizza , gnocci and home-made pasta . We highly recommend Monna Lisa pizzeria on La Calzada in Granada , Nicaragua . <h> 28 Comments <p> Congrats on reaching 1 year ! I cant believe you 've been able to keep track of all those beds and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I doubt I could remember transportation , even for just a 2 week trip . Glad to see that my city was one of your 5 favorites ! <p> Hi Ekua ! Thanks for the congrats . On some long bus/plane ride recently we started listing exactly how we got from A to B to C etc. until we really had our entire list of transportation ! Maybe its the power of putting two heads together ? Or just a lot of time on our hands on these long trips ? San Francisco was easily one of our major highlights we loved it there ! <p> Point taken Earl were definitely slowing down a lot this next year , at least that 's the plan . Of course Playa is on the list , you know how great it was where we stayed with the basically private beach and everything . Hope you enjoyed your flautas and tacos . Extremely jealous , but I guess well just go get more pizza ! = Take care , hopefully we see you again soon ! <p> Congratulations darlings ! So happy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have been eating pasta for 2 days straight . The pizza here is not so good . Many good travel wishes for the future and I hope I get to meet you ladies one day ! ! ! <p> Hey Craig , thanks so much ! It feels less like an achievement and just more the start of something that we are no where near ready to stop ! : - ) Glad you enjoyed the wrap up . Hopefully our paths will cross sometime and we can swap stories in person ! ! ! <p> Happy travel anniversary . Im impressed that you were able to keep all of the numbers straight = I already forgot what I had for lunch yesterday ! I think 13 countries is a year is plenty by the way . Plus , considering you only averaged abut 3.5 nights per bed ( love that statistic : ) ) , you probably moved around a lot in each country too Happy travels ! <p> Thanks Sabrina ! 13 countries really was a lot , but we had ( somehow ) thought we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then as well . We definitely saw a lot of each country , we really prefer getting out of the main towns . Speaking Spanish helps with that , do n't  know what we will do in countries where we do n't  speak the language . Guess well see ! <p> Congratulations ! 13 countries seems a lot to us we only made it to 6 in our first year ! The thought of adding up beds slept in and transport taken makes my head ache , but I can see how thatd be a good task for passing the time on a long bus trip . Enjoy Tuscany ! <p> Hi guys , thanks ! We are definitely making the most of Tuscany ! It was surprisingly easy to remember our hotels and our transport this past year has whizzed by , but really every day made an impression on us . Reviewing it all brought back a load of memories as well ! <p> First , congrats on making it to your first 12 months ! My partner , Sam , and I hope to start our long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many beds in your first year and I was wondering how many times you ended up staying in the region a week or more in one place ? <p> Hi Zab ! Thanks for stopping by ! Great that you 've got plans to go abroad -looks like we might be able to meet up in South America , we 're headed back there ( at least we think ! ) We stayed many places for over a week " Leon and Granada were both two weeks , one month in Playa del Carmen , Mexico , plus longer housesits in Tucson and Germany . Basically we are not afraid to change hotels after just one night " we do this often until we find somewhere where all the factors add up to our satisfaction . Definitely keep in touch ! <p> Like brothers from another mother we are ! = Except were sisters . Sistas . Well anyway , yes we want to do this for at least another year ( but probably more ) , and we are definitely going to meet up somewhere , hopefully sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany now for a bit again . Bye Bye PizzasHello Brezn ! = <p> Ha thanks ! The accommodation part of traveling is really a focus of ours we feel like where you lay your head has a lot to do with happiness for long-term travel . So , we remember most beds without thinking too hard even ! Thanks for the well wishes we hope to have at least a few more of these anniversaries = <p> Oh thanks so much ! We just put our heads together and reviewed our whole trip from the start and managed to remember all those stats . Its the trip of a lifetime , so we try to forget as little as possible . Thanks for reading , will definitely get over and check out Terra Firma Tourist right away ! All the best to you for your travels as well ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143240 @2543240/ <h> Charmant in the City " Luang Prabang , Laos <p> Were city people . We love the buzz , the food , the art , the people-watching that can be done in big cities <p> So after touring the more remote areas of northern Laos , the French colonial city of Luang Prabang almost had a big city vibe . Within the course of an afternoon of exploring , Luang Prabang began showing its colors as a charming little gem . Home to 100,000 people , Luang Prabang is the second largest city in Laos ( Vientiane , the sleepy capital , has a population of roughly 1.3 million ) . Decades after French rule , Luang Prabang has long since been rightfully re-conquered ' by international tourists , making it both a comfortable , entertaining place to visit but equally requires some good planning to avoid the masses . Read on for our recommendations of what to see and do in Luang Prabang . <p> 367 steps to the top of Phou Si <p> It might seem like quite a haul to slog up 367 steps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something all visitors to the city must do. - On our first full day in town we scaled the hill , arriving at the That Chomsi temple for breathtaking views of wider Luang Prabang and the peninsula where Old Town is located , right where the mighty Mekong and the Nam Khan rivers meet . <p> For those of you who , like Dani , are addicted to scouting out amazing sunset photo opportunities , the sunset must be shot from up here : two rivers , mountains , a Buddhist temple and miles of palm trees jutting up into layers of striking colors . However , hundreds of people will be joining you , which means getting up to the top at least an hour early to secure a good spot ( bring mosquito spray , they 're aggressive up there ) . <p> For those of you who , like me , get annoyed by masses of camera toting tourists , go up here in the morning and at dusk have a stroll through the night market at that time " the stalls are still just being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you have the place to much more to yourself . <p> Hit the markets <p> We have each been living out of a 60-70 liter backpack for the last two years " so we tend not to buy much at markets , but even we ended up buying quite a few little things at the night market in Luang Prabang . Lining Sisavangvong Road , a main thoroughfare , the market is unavoidable . We spent hours here looking at the paintings , silk scarves , blankets , wooden masks and gawking at the bottles of Lao rice whiskey , which usually come with snakes or large insects in the bottom of bottle that put that tiny worm at the bottom of a tequila bottle to shame . <p> There is also a morning market just off this road and it is an entirely local experience . Rather than tourist trinkets , we found fresh produce , piles of seaweed and fresh fish plucked from the Mekong and some more bizarre items such as fried rats , grilled insects , fresh frogs , or ox heads . <p> Cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atop Phou Si that Luang Prabang stretches far beyond the old town , so we did what we always do to see more of a city , and hopped on bikes . Bicycle rentals are abundant and inexpensive , and touring around on two wheels was a relaxing way to really get out and explore . We rented a stylish city cruiser for a day for 20,000 kip ( $2.50 ) and sliced through the interesting dichotomy of crumbling French-style colonial architecture and intricately designed Buddhist temples ( called wats ) . Wat Xieng Thong on the north end of the peninsula is the grandest temple in Luang Prabang , built in 1560 . <p> Learn to cook , Lao style <p> Most of us are familiar with Thai cuisine , but neighboring Lao does n't have quite the international culinary presence despite some interesting dishes . To learn more about Lao food in Luang Prabang , we decided between three cooking schools ( Tamarind , Tam Nak and Tum Tum Cheng ) opting in the end for Tum Tum Cheng . We ended up with a private class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to create an all-vegetarian menu of five items . <p> Included in that was a lesson in preparing sticky rice , the absolute staple of Lao cuisine . We started the morning on a trip to the morning market with Noi , the sister of the chef . She explained many of the curious items we normally just photograph and wonder about . In our absence , the staff prepped the ingredients , so when we returned from the market all we had to do was learn to make the dishes . Unlike our cooking course on Koh Lanta , this took most the hard work out of the experience and cut the time down to about an hour of actual class time . We ended up cooking a feast for six , but ate it all ourselves at the end and washed it down with a glass of local orange fruit wine . You can find Tum Tum Cheng on Facebook . GlobetrotterGirls say Relax ! <p> After all the markets and cycling and slaving over a hot stove ( not really " more like eating enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We discovered the Herbal Steam bath in Nong Khiew , and hunted down an equally inexpensive and utterly relaxing herbal steam spa experience in Luang Prabang , just off Sisavangvong Road ( the night market ) for 10,000 kip ( $1.25 ) . There are others , but they charge foreigner ' prices up to $8.25 an hour which wo n't break the bank , but we prefer paying local prices for local experiences . The steam rooms are usually simple wooden rooms like saunas . Mist laced with fresh local herbs like lemongrass sprays through a pipe into the room from a barrel , or drum , underneath . The room gets very warm , so the experience involves alternating between ten minutes of steam and ten minutes out of the room drinking warm herbal tea . The combination of steam , heat and the herbs opens the pores and is completely relaxing . The saunas provide a sarong to wear in the steam room , a towel and free warm herbal tea . <p> Alternatively , Luang Prabang has dozens of top massage studios in town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , head and shoulder massages , foot massages as well as manis , pedis and facials . We found the cheapest massage places on- Khem Khong ( the road right by the Mekong River ) where one-hour massages cost 38,000 kip ( $4.75 ) . <p> Witness Tak Bat , but please tread lightly <p> Every morning just after sunrise , hundreds of monks dressed in their flowing saffron robes make their way through the streets of Luang Prabang collecting alms . Local Buddhists line the streets , sometimes kneeling , and fills the monks ' alms with rice , bananas and other cooked food to show respect for the monks and a dedication to Buddhism ( a ritual often misunderstood by Westerners as charity ) . It is a photographer 's dream to witness this , but unfortunately the spiritual ritual has become a tourist spectacle over the last few years here in Luang Prabang . Busloads of tourists are brought to Sisavangvong Road in the morning and despite being told the rules ( stay on the other side of the road , no flash , keep distance ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the monks faces . It is at best bizarre , and at worst heart-breaking to witness what is essentially citizen paparazzi snapping shots of what should be a very spiritual , somber experience . <p> Dani found a spot off Sisavangvong on a side street where monks received alms undisturbed and asks you to please read the Do 's and Don'ts beforehand . For a more detailed account of the popular experience , you can read fellow travel blogger Barbara 's account of taking part in the alms giving ceremony here . <p> Visit the waterfalls <p> Around Luang Prabang there are several waterfalls to cool off and go for a swim , the most popular being the Kuang Si waterfalls 30 kilometers out of town . Negotiate a price with a private tuktuk who will take you there and back , or for a cheaper price ( 40,000 kip/$5 ) join up with one of the tours offered by one of Luang Prabang 's many tourist agencies . For those who are very comfortable on a motorbike , - there are also moped/motorcycle rentals for the day but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so confidence is necessary . <p> The other waterfalls , a little bit closer to town , are the Tad Sae waterfalls , which are not as high as the Kuang Si waterfalls but spectacular , as the water cascades over dozens of levels and swimming is possible in the pools created by them . The tourist agencies also sell plenty of other tourist packages to explore more of the countryside , so have a look around town and see what you might prefer once you arrive in the city . We would n't advise pre-booking any tours more than a day in advance , as there is no need . <p> We found Hobomaps to be the most useful for Luang Prabang . The map includes guesthouses , restaurants and all the major sights , visit Hobomaps.com. <h> 30 Comments <p> Thanks so much for this wonderfully complete article about what to do and see in Luang Prabang , and for pointing your readers to my article about the proper behavior during the alms-giving ceremony . It is truly sad what is happening , but the more we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this lovely ceremony , as there has been talk of stopping the practice due to the tourist circus it has become . <p> Barbara it really would be a shame if this traditional ceremony would be stopped because of the tourists . We were surprised when we witnessed the exact same ceremony in Cambodia with no tourists around at all how did it become such a circus in Luang Prabang ? ? I could n't believe it when I saw tourists holding their cameras straight into the monks faces , flash photography everywhere and people were pushing each other to get the best spots it must be horrible for the monks to experience this every single morning . <p> The cooking course looks excellent . There is nothing better than having locals explaining the local ingredients to you and showing you how to prepare them . How much did you pay for the course ? I did one in Cambodia for $26 , which I found a bit expensive , but then it was the only cooking school in Phnom Penh , so I did n't  have much choice . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon I had the teacher all to myself as well . Anyway your photos made me very hungry , so I will go in hunt for some street food now . = <p> Tammy the cooking class was pretty expensive at $30 , but we shopped around and found that all three cooking classes in Luang Prabang cost the same ( 25,000 Kip ) . With all the food we got , the recipe book and the tour of the market we thought it was worth it though . Isnt it the best to have a teacher all to yourself ? = <p> It is indeed . He was actually quite intrigued finding out about German cooking as well ( I am German ) and suggested that we should open a joint cooking school . I said to him that I cant see many people taking up German cooking classes though . = <p> Oh we had no idea you were German ! Wish we wouldve had the chance to meet up with you you are still in Cambodia , right ? And I agree not sure how many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes great shame , but I think you had already left Phnom Penh by the time I have discovered your blog . Yes I am still in Cambodia . Will be here until September actually , as we have just been offered some consultancy work . After that who knows ( really fancy South America ) , so our paths might hopefully cross at one stage . Gute Weiterreise ! = <p> It looks like there are many things to see and do in Luang Prabang , but that cooking class really seems not to be missed ! I love to cook , and I think that when my husband and I leave on our RTW trip in a few months , I will miss it at times , even with all the delicious street food throughout Asia . I definitely think I will need to make some time ( and room in the budget ) to learn how to make some of these delicious dishes along the way ! <p> Steph We highly recommend taking a cooking class Thailand has some fantastic &amp; inexpensive cooking classes and we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few times when we had a kitchen in Thailand because we love to cook as well , but it turned out more expensive than eating in a restaurant ! <p> Luang Prabang was one of my favorite cities in SE Asia , its very relaxing and not too big , but still offers plenty of stuff to do and see . I liked the night market a lot , much more relaxed market experience than visiting the Thai markets where people are really keen on selling you things . I did n't  go see the Tak Bat , but that was more to do with the fact that I really am not a morning person . <p> Jarmo , my fellow Finn ditto ! Also missed Tak Bat and was told waterfalls were low on the supplies so gave that a miss . I just loved the general vibe in LP and couldve stayed for much longer than three days ! <p> Did you girls go to Utopia ? Amazing chilled out oasis that not that many people seemed to have found ! I also loved Traditional Arts &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town http : //www.taeclaos.org/ <p> Anni yes , it is true , Utopia seemed to be not on many peoples radar ! We did not come across the TAEC though sad that we missed it ! I have a feeling we will return to Luang Prabang sooner or later though = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143241 @2543241/ <h> Three Mayan sites you ca n't miss in Central America <p> Every traveler has different reasons to visit Central America " for some , it 's the outstanding wildlife in places like Guatemala and Costa Rica , for others it 's the stunning beaches , and some simply enjoy to soak up small town life in the many Spanish-colonial towns throughout Mexico , Belize , Guatemala , Nicaragua , Honduras , El Salvador , Costa Rica and Panama . One reason I was drawn to the region was the rich Mayan history and culture . As a history buff , I was always fascinated by the Mayan calendar , their hieroglyphs , and their pyramid-temples . Visiting some of their biggest cities in Mesoamerica was and still is a highlight of all of my travels.If you , like me , are fascinated by the Mayan culture , here are three Mayan sites that you ca n't miss on a trip to Central America : <h> Tikal , Guatemala <p> Tikal with its spectacular jungle setting and its palaces , ceremonial platforms , ball courts , temples and vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two highest steep-sided temples , each rising over 144 feet ( 44 meters ) into the sky " higher than the surrounding jungle trees ! " are a sight that you wo n't forget anytime soon.The ruin site comprises of 400 hectares , making it one of the largest Mayan sites in Mesoamerica , and many of its monuments have well preserved decorated surfaces , such as stone carvings , hieroglyphic inscriptions and mural paintings . These paintings depict the dynastic history of Tikal but also its relationships with other Mayan cities , such as Copan in Honduras or Calakmul in Mexico . <h> Chichen Itza , Mexico <p> It is hard to pick a single Mayan site in Mexico " the Mayan Riviera is called that for a reason , and there are plenty of Mayan ruins to visit : Coba , Tulum , or Chichen Itza are just a few examples of the well-preserved Mayan empire in Mexico , but Chichen Itza is the one that held the most magnificence for the Mayans.The city holds history of nearly 1,000 years , and has some of the most significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circular observatory known as El Caracol , the step pyramid El Castillo which forms the centerpiece of the Mayan site . The columned arcades of Chichen Itza , the pyramids and temples , the ball court ( which is the largest one known in Mesoamerica ) all make the sacred city a Seventh Wonder Of The World , but it is also the fact that the 365-day calendar is prevalent here in the stone steps of El Castillo , and how twice a year , on the spring and the fall equinoxes , a shadow in the shape of a serpent falls on the pyramid , making this an astonishing spectacle to see this snake ' descend the steps as the sun sets . <h> Copan , Honduras <p> Copan used to be the political , civil and religious center of the Copan Valley , and the population here dates back to 1500 BC . The complex consists of the Acropolis and several plazas , like the Ceremonial Plaza with its remarkable stadium , the Hieroglyphic Stairway Plaza with more than 1,800 hieroglyphs ( which is considered one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longest Mayan inscription ) , ball courts and temples.The city was reigned by a dynasty of 16 rulers who made Copan one of the most important Mayan cities during the Classic Maya Period . Despite being such an important Mayan site , it sees much less visitors than the Mayan ruins in Mexico , which makes it even more special " in some parts you 'll have the site entirely to yourself ! <h> How to visit Central America 's Mayan sites <p> Since Central America is pretty compact , it is easy to visit the sites independently , and use public transportation to get from one country to the next . <p> If you are planning your trip from the UK , check out Thomson 's Central American cruises , which do not only offer great value for money , but also a few days to take in Central America 's gorgeous beaches and getting from place to place in the most comfortable way . Thomson even has a cruise dedicated to Mayan sites , the Mayan Treasures cruise.If you 're traveling independently , you 'll need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with some clever planning , you can fit in Chichen Itza , Tulum , Coba ( Mexico ) , Caracol ( Belize ) , Tikal ( Guatemala ) and Copan ( Honduras ) into a 2-week trip . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143242 @2543242/ <h> 10 Essential Things To Pack For A Day Hike <p> Since I am hiking in Northern Californias Redwoods these week , I thought it would be the perfect time to share my packing essentials . Here is my packing checklist with 10 essential items I always pack for a successful day hike : <h> 1 Hiking clothes <p> This is clearly the most important thing to make a hike successful : you need appropriate gear . I recommend quick drying pants , made from a light , synthetic material . Avoid cotton , because it traps sweat . If you 're starting early in the morning , you might want to add an extra layer fleece is perfect to keep you warm . Depending on where you 're hiking , you might also want to pack a lightweight rain jacket and a hat to protect you from the sun . If you do n't  want to spend a whole lot of money on new hiking gear , I recommend checking out BC25.com , a website where users can find deals and discount codes . You can look up coupon codes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handy outdoor gear price checker which gets you instant price comparisons . These discount codes include major brands like The North Face , Cotopaxi or Patagonia and outdoor stores like REI. <h> 2 Footwear <p> Just as important as comfortable hiking clothes are comfortable hiking shoes . It pays off to invest a little more in a good pair of hiking shoes . I recommend shoes with a waterproof , breathable membrane and sturdy , supportive high ankles . Brands I love include Merrells , Vasque and Hi-Tec . When it comes to shoes , expensive does n't  always mean the best . What 's most important is that your feet are comfortable in them , that the soles will last for a while , the shoes are not too heavy and that your feet can breathe . When buying a pair of new hiking shoes , make sure to try them on . There needs to be wiggling room for your toes and the shoes should n't feel tight anywhere . <h> 3 A solid backpack <p> Just as important as comfortable footwear and clothes is the right backpack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , but also not too small , a pack that fits well , is light weight , is well designed ( with practical pockets ) and has an extra hip support belt . Key is not to fill up your pack all the way make sure you only bring things you 'll really need . <h> 4 Bug spray / Bear spray <p> Depending on where you are hiking , you need to pack a can of bug repellent and/or bear spray . Ive been on several hikes where I got eaten by mosquitoes and quite frankly , it can completely ruin a hike , because no matter how beautiful the scenery you 're walking through if all you can think about is your itching bites , you wont be able to enjoy it . As for bear spray if you 're hiking in bear country , and you do n't  take any precautions for a possible bear encounter , you 're stupid . <h> 5 A Map or Compass <p> Knowing where you 're going is key on a hike . If you 're hiking in a State Park with clearly marked trails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea to download an offline map . If you 're doing a wilderness hike , a compass is absolutely essential . <h> 6 A Flashlight or Headlamp <p> I personally prefer a headlamp because it allows me to have both hands free , but a flashlight also works . If you 're thinking you 'll be back before dusk still pack a flashlight . I 've gone on several hikes now where I completely underestimated how long it would take me . Even my hike up to the Hollywood Sign in LA a couple of months ago had me scramble down the unlit dirt trail in the dark because I had enjoyed the views from up there for much longer than expected . Luckily I could use the flashlight on my smartphone , but if you decide to rely on your phones flashlight , make sure you have enough battery or pack a portable charger . I 'd still preferred a headlamp in the uneven terrain that I was walking through so that I 'd be able to hold onto things for a better balance . <h> 7 Sufficient snacks and water <p> No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without water . As for snacks , make sure you calculate an appropriate amount of snacks for your hike nothing is worse than a long way down the mountain with a rumbling tummy . Good snacks include for example trail mix , nuts , nut-based bars , fruits and veggies , energy bars , sandwiches and granola bars . Staying hydrated is extremely important carry at least 2 liters of water , but more when you are going on desert hikes . <h> 8 First Aid Kit <p> Another absolute must : a first aid kit . The main items it should contain are band aids , sterile dressing pads to stop bleeding from an open wound , tweezers and safety pins , an antibiotic ointment , duct tape , ibuprofen and antihistamine . While it is easy to put together your own first aid kit , the most convenient thing to do is to invest in a pre-packed first aid kit for hikers. <h> 9 Camera Gear <p> Obviously I am biased here , since I never leave the house without my camera , but when you 're on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . Most people are content with the quality of the photos their smartphone takes ( again , make sure to bring a portable charger ) , but if you 're looking to enlarge some images later on to a canvas sized poster , you might want to look into some more expensive camera gear . For a hike , I highly recommend a lightweight and compact mirror-less camera . CNET has a fantastic overview of the best mirror-less cameras that are out there right now . <h> 10 Sun and/or rain cover <p> Depending on where you 're hiking , you 'll want to bring a rain cover for your backpack and for yourself . The cheap waterproof hiking pants I invested in when I hiked to Machu Picchu were some of the best hiking equipment I ever bought ( and they were only $6 ) . I 've already mentioned a rain jacket under #1 , and this can usually double as a wind breaker . For sunny hikes , sun screen , sun glasses and a hat are a must . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

And while that was indeed the case , we ended up experiencing the salt flats in not one but two countries anyway before our flight . First there were Argentinas salt flats that we visited on our road trip through the stunning Quebrada de Humahuaca , then we crossed over the Andes into Chile to the Atacama Desert , also known as the driest desert in the world , where one of the highlights of our week-long stay was the Salar de Atacama , the largest salt flat in Chile . <p> These did n't  look anything like the bright white salt flats of Argentina , or the ones we knew to be over the border in Bolivia . Instead , the 100km by 80km area looks rough and rugged , with grayish rocks jutting up from the ground as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are much more impressive because instead the salt also reaches over 1.5km deep ( ! ) , whereas the more famous salt flats have only a thin layer on the surface 100-200 centimeters thick .

@@107143249 @2543249/ <h> Happy Anniversary ! Today we celebrate three years on the road <p> As we sat down to review this third year of our travels this morning , Dani said something that , although it was an offhand remark , really resonated with me . Instead of happy anniversary , or happy travel-versary , she said Happy Birthday. - Had this journey only lasted six months or a year , the results would have been temporary , but with three years under our belts and no end in sight , it is now clear that April 30 , 2010 was the start of entirely new lives for us both . <p> This celebration also gives us the chance to take a look back at the last 365 days to get a sense of just how much two people can squeeze into 52 weeks . What we have discovered is that life is going to fly by , and at our age years fly by the way that months used to , so why not try to pack in as much as possible into each set of four seasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for May 2012 April 2013 . We first asked the main questions , like <h> How many countries did we visit ? Seven 7 <p> Unlike in previous years , we spent longer amounts of time in fewer countries . Last year we hit 13 , this year , only seven . <p> We may have only spent time in seven countries , but we crossed back and forth over and through the Andes several times between Argentina and Chile , which really upped our numbers here to 13 borders . That 's roughly one border per month , but it did n't work out that way chronologically . <p> Chile to Argentina ( hitchhiked from Porvenir to San Sebastian border crossing on Tierra del Fuego ) <p> Argentina to Uruguay ( by plane from Ushuaia to Montevideo ) <p> Uruguay to Argentina ( by bus from Montevideo to Rosario ) <p> Argentina to Chile ( by bus from Jujuy to San Pedro De Atacama via Paseo de Jama ) <p> Chile to USA ( by plane from Santiago to New York City via Panama and Orlando ) <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep in ? Fifty seven 57 <p> In the last 365 days , we slept in 57 beds . Compared to Year 1 , which totalled 104 beds and Year 2 , when we slept in 90 beds , 57 beds does n't  seem like much at all . However , that 's a huge number considering we lived in just one place for almost one month in Tucson , under two months in Mexico and again Costa Rica , six weeks in Buenos Aires and then seven weeks in Santiago . If you took out all our housesits and extended stays in places , it 's roughly one new bed every three days . What we see from Year 3 is that we have really found a balance between housesitting and long-term stays and heavy travel for a few months at a time . <p> In the last 365 days , - how many types of transportation did we take ? - <h> More travel by numbers for our third year on the road- <p> # of night buses " 6 <p> These do not count as beds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South America called them semi-camas ' ( semi-beds ) . On six occasions we spent the night traveling on a bus , getting very little sleep , clinging to our bags and hoping not to have to use the bathroom . The scenery during the day is spectacular , but once the sun sets these rides are no fun at all . <p> # of beaches " 15 <p> We started the year on Indian beaches in Kerala and Goa , then lived on a couple in Mexico and Costa Rica , but even though we followed Chile 's coastline up and down , our South American beach time was limited . Uruguay has gorgeous beaches , and we definitely see ourselves spending more time in Punta del Diablo in the future . <p> # of days on the beach 132 <p> Over one-third of our third travel year was spent living on a beachsono complaints here ! <p> We had a stellar year in this category , with five amazing housesitting opportunities .

If you own a home , having housesitters allows you travel for longer periods of time without paying a dime for pet or house care . If you are location independent like us , or want to be , housesitting allows you to stay around the world with all the creature comforts of home , rent free and without all the commitment . We cant recommend housesitting highly enough and encourage you all to get started ! <p> Our eBook , Break Free <p> # of posts published 163 From May 2012 April 2013 , we hit publish on a post every 2 days on average .

The event was an amazing opportunity to connect with over 150 people who were all about to head off on long term trips , from a month or two to complete location independence ! <p> # of pizzas " 45 <p> Considering the fact that we got healthier than ever this year doing the Insanity workout and eating healthier than ever before , this number seems a bit high . However , yes , in the last 52 weeks we scarfed down 45 pizzas , 15 of which were in our six weeks in Buenos Aires . Somehow Jess still dropped three sizes , so no harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although it felt like we spent much of our time traveling through barren South American landscapes , we actually spent time in 14 cities this year including major world cities like New York , Chicago , Mexico City , Buenos Aires and Santiago , as well as smaller cities like Valparaiso , Chile and Rosario and Salta , Argentina . <p> # of things lost " 7 <p> This number is entirely an estimate , because we often do n't even realize the things that we lose along the way . We 're not big on possessions so most of these did n't affect us , but losing Danis iPod somewhere in Santiago and the charger and cable in northern Argentina hurt a bit ( okay , a lot ) . We also lost a bikini top , an iPhone charger and cable , Jess driver 's license , a good razor and at least 10 pairs of socks . <p> # of amazing wildlife animals 11 ( rough estimate ) <p> We saw elephants ( and cows ) in India , and lived on the beach in tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coatis right outside our backyard . Dani witnessed the incredible sea turtle Arribada in nearby Ostional beach there , too . In South America , there were penguins , sea lions and +andus in Patagonia , alligators at Iguazu Falls , plus llamas and their relatives guanacos and vicu+as , flamingos and loads of different birds in northern Argentina and Chile . <p> # of injuries " 4 ( all Jess ) <p> Despite this being my healthiest year since my early 20s , I spent much of it quite injured . In fact , after a residual knee injury caused serious knee pain in India , what spurred the health kick was being rammed by a cow in Palolem and being unable to walk for three weeks ( I guess I really needed a swift kick in the ass , no ? ) After resting and healing up nicely in Tucson and Mexico , I broke my baby toe walking barefoot on the beach , which sidelined me for another month . We started the Insanity workout in September and rocked through this plus outdoor park workouts even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthier than ever , I pushed it too hard and strained my ankle which meant Dani had to do most of the Patagonia hiking without me . I 'm happily ending this third year injury free ! <p> # of photos taken 13,001 <p> Dani took just ( just ) over 13,000 pictures over the last year an average of over 1,000 photos per month . Surprisingly , this is less than last year , when she snapped 15,437 pictures . <h> Budget How much does a year of travel cost ? <p> Budgeting is not something that comes easily to us , but damn if Dani isnt- diligent- about tracking our spending . This year we started using the TrailWallet app , which helps us keep track of and categorize every single peso , rupee , dollar and pound we spend each day and categorize it to see what areas make the biggest dent in our bank accounts . <p> If there is one thing we can say about our budget , it is that we are now more confident in spending money . Looking back at our first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back then , being unsure of how to sustain our earnings , we were clearly shoestring travelers . <p> As soon as we were sure this was going to be a lifestyle , not just a trip we knew we had to start living more comfortably . This meant that in our second year , spending increased by almost $10,000 , reaching $38,152 for two people . <p> This seems to be our comfort zone , and even though it seemed like we were just- hemorrhaging- money traveling through South America in high season , we ended our third year of travel on a similar budget , spending $37,588 between 1 May 2012 and 30 April 2013 . <p> That said , there are some huge difference in how much we spent in each place in India for example , we spent just over $500 each per month , while in Buenos Aires , Argentina that shot up to almost $2000 per person per month . <h> Our top 5 favorite places <p> So remote we had no cell reception and were entirely off-the-grid , living on a remote Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life that few people ever have . Life was so laid-back here , in fact , that when my sandals broke , I just went barefoot for two weeks before we made a trip to the big supermarket , three hours away . <p> We knew we 'd love it here , but had no idea just how much . The attraction is not only because of the architecture , or the pizza , or the street art , or the Argentine accent ( which we did get used to and ended up really loving ) or the combination of the above . It is all of that on top of the open , friendly community of that welcomed us with open arms and within days we had full social calendars as thought we had been living there for years . <p> San Pedro de Atacama , Chile <p> This town thousands of kilometers north of Santiago and over 4,000m ( 13,000ft ) above sea level is like Mad Max meets rock festivals . Just a few minutes out of town , the landscape looks like the moon or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driest in the world . Yet in town , the food in restaurants lining all sand roads is sophisticated and complex , live music spills from bars late into the night and the hotels range well into luxury . <p> Tucson , Arizona <p> It would take a stellar year to knock Tucson off our list . There is just something about this low-key , sprawling town 80 miles from the Mexico border that keeps it so high on our list it might just be the mix of the saguaros , the colors in the sky at sunset , the owners we housesit for and the wild west meets Mexico feeling in the food and art around town . <p> Cafayate , Argentina <p> Cafayate and the surrounding countryside was an unexpected gem . The landscape is a combination of bright green vineyards like Napa Valley , red rocks like Colorado , mountains resembling the Grand Canyon and rock formations like Monument Valley , and that all with the snow capped peaks of the Andes in the far background .

It feels amazing after traveling through Argentine Patagonia and the Chilean desert to be in such a densely packed global city , yet after less than a week we already feel right at home in our Brooklyn four story walk up and know we 'll love every minute of our six week housesit here . <h> Our top 5 best food moments <p> Huevos Rancheros in Mexico The house we lived in was so remote that grocery trucks and tortillas delivered by motorcycle were often our only way to stock up on food between big six-hour round trips to the city . Luckily , Dani perfected the art of Huevos Rancheros , a meal we ate once a day , almost every day , for two months . <p> Homecookin ' on the Houseboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in India itself , we found , but our personal chef on our three day houseboat cruise performed magic and miracles to create delicious Keralan feasts three times a day , causing us to spend the entire cruise in a gluttonous food coma- heaven ! <p> Green smoothies in Santiago The further along the year progressed , the healthier the two of us got and during our Santiago housesit , we started making green smoothies for breakfast everyday " including spinach , bananas , orange juice , and other fruit and veg . We had glowing skin and loads of energy and missed these so dearly as we traveled the next three months without them . <p> Food in San Pedro de Atacama Most restaurants in San Pedro offer three course meals for $15 ( incl wine or cocktail ) and never once were we disappointed by a meal . We 'll cover this in more detail soon , but who'd'a thunk we could eat like queens in the middle of a desert ? <h> Our top 5 best hotel stays <p> From luxury to budget and everything in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> El Patio 77 , Mexico City <p> We had a sampler of three gorgeous bed and breakfasts during an extended weekend in Mexico City , but eco-focused , traveler-friendly El Patio 77 won above Casa Roa and the Chill Out Flat B&amp;B with its minimalist yet arty design , integration of green technology and location in a quiet neighborhood just three stops from Mexico City 's Zocalo , or central park .

Looking forward to another 3 years of great blogging and pictures from around the world . TY . <p> Thanks so much , John ! The food in Kerala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to find out if we can find Indian breakfast somewhere in NYC loved the spicy veggie sauce they cooked up with the eggs = <p> Great stats ladies ! We have a stats blog too , but you have some very interesting categories on hereI love the amount of pizzas consumed ! <p> House-sitting seems to be the way to go and we are seriously looking into that for after our upcoming trip . Our budget is about the same as yours , and we were surprised to see how much you spent in Buenos Aires , do you think it can be traveled and enjoyed for less ? <p> Hi Dariece , the amount of pizza consumed is shockingly high this year , but we just LOVE pizza = About Buenos Aires- we could have done it for less , but like we said , we do want to enjoy a place and tend to spend more money than other travelers nice meals , coffee ( yes , not cheap in Argentina ! ) but we also did n't  take advantage of the cash exchange rate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ATMs give you . If you change $100 in cash , you get between 750 and 800 Pesos for it , but if I withdraw the same amount , I only get 500 Pesos i.e. $200 in cash get you the same amount that $300 get you via an ATM . So whenever we had USD that we could exchange , our money stretched much further unfortunately we did n't  bring in any USD when we started our travels through Argentina in Buenos Aires . Lesson learned ! ! <p> Wow wow wow ! Amazing . I had no idea you travelled with dresses , but you clearly scrubbed up pretty good in that first picture ! Very nice . <p> How do you know how many pizzas you ate ? Seems like the weirdest statistic here to me , but perhaps given what fans you are !

About our BA budget I think we just suffered from a very unfavorable exchange rate- we spent just over 19,000 Pesos ( but actually in 6 weeks , and it included US$160 for Jess visa and US$340 for our bus tickets to Santiago ) . Had we gotten the ( unofficial ) exchange rate of 8 Pesos to the dollar , we 'd only spent US$2,388 , but since we only only got 5 Pesos to the dollar , it added up to US$3820 . Note to self : Bring US Dollars when returning to Argentina = Enjoy northern Argentina- we loved the scenery there ! <p> Thanks , Lauren !

@@107143252 @2543252/ <h> My Packing Light Challenge <p> My current trip to New York is the shortest trip I 've taken in years . Only three weeks . When I realized I was traveling to the U.S. and back on two budget airlines ( Norwegian and Ryanair ) that make you pay for checked baggage , I decided it was time for a challenge : Traveling with only carry-on luggage . To put this in perspective " we are not talking about pennies for checked-in baggage , but a considerable amount of money which easily outweigh the price for ticket . Taking a 20kg suitcase on Ryanair sets you back at -35 ( US$56 ) , Norwegian charges -26 ( US$42 ) " so for the flight to NYC I would have paid $98 , and the same amount for the journey back " that 's nearly $200 ! <h> Finding the right carry-on <p> Carry-on luggage is ( still ) free , so I decided to try to fit in three weeks ' worth of clothes into a 55cm x 40cm x 20cm suitcase . That 's where packing light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I usually prefer duffel bags , but they do n't really have the measurements that airlines require for carry-ons , and so I decide that it was time to shop for a small wheeled suitcase . Luckily , there are online retailers like In Luggage , where travelers can not only pick up their luggage of choice but also any add-ons they might need , such as cabin bottles , luggage straps , locks and adapters for foreign countries . Similar to other online retailers , all products are offered at a much cheaper rate than in a department store , and they offer all major brands , including my personal favorite Samsonite . <p> I kind of like traveling with carry-on only ! <p> When choosing a bag or suitcase , I recommend picking something that is convenient for the place you 're visiting ( in the hilly cobblestone streets of Peru I would have struggled with a wheeled suitcase , for example ) and to pick out a lightweight bag . <p> Usually , when I check my baggage , I carry a small daypack with me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and electronics , but since my suitcase would be my carry-on and low-cost airlines are really strict about the amount of pieces you have ( only one is allowed ) , I brought the cheap foldable tote bag I had picked up at the Brooklyn Flea this past summer . I could easily slide it into the side pocket of my suitcase but get it out quickly as soon as I exited the plane to have things like my wallet , my passport , etc. handy . <h> Plan what to pack <p> I have to admit that usually , when I travel with my giant 65-liter backpack , I do n't put much thought into what I pack and what I do n't " because the bag is big enough to fit it all ! Traveling only with a carry-on made a huge difference for me : I actually had to plan what I 'd bring . So I sat down and made a list of things I knew I would really need , and the clothes I was planning to wear . <p> That list is much shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my backpack , but I figured I 'd manage for three weeks with only those items ( and so far I do ! ) . <p> Note : Obviously I was wearing most of the clothes that take up a lot of space like my jacket , hoodie , hat one pair of jeans and my clunky boots on the flight . <h> Pack tight <p> I 've already raved about them on my Travel Gear Page , and I ca n't say it often enough : packing cubes revolutionized my packing ! Not only do they safe space , but they also make it easier to find things . I have one cube just for my underwear and socks , for example , one for tops , and so on . In those cubes , roll your clothes , and you 'll be able to fit even more . <h> Take minis <p> This one might be obvious , because you 're taking only carry-on , which means you have to comply to airline regulations for how much of a liquid you are allowed to bring on the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ container ; packed in a clear plastic zip-top bag . So I bought a miniature makeup remove , miniature mouthwash , contact lens solution and toothpaste " and that 's about it . I knew I would n't need to bring shampoo , shower gel , etc. " because : <h> Buy it there <p> You can buy everything you need in almost any place in the world ! Unless you have a special brand you use , shampoo brands like Pantene , Herbal Essences , Garnier Fructis or Head &amp; Shoulders can be found in most countries , and things like toothpaste and mouthwash are needed elsewhere just as much as they 're in your home country . Other products for daily needs such as contact lenses solution , condoms or female hygiene products are widely available " I have yet to go to a place where I ca n't find the things I need . And as Rick Steves , a huge advocate on traveling with carry-on only , puts it in his article on traveling light : if millions of people can exist without a certain thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . <p> While it might seem hard to pack less than usual ( especially for chronic overpackers like me ! ) " it is definitely possible .

@@107143254 @2543254/ <h> What to pack for safari travel <p> Packing is often one of the most exciting parts of preparing for a big trip , especially if you 're going somewhere as distant as Africa . You need to take plenty of care when packing your bags though , as there wo n't be too many opportunities to drop by the shops and pick up something you 've missed once you 're in the middle of the savannah .

Use non-rigid bags that are n't too large to avoid any complications . <h> Clothing <p> The key for your safari wardrobe is neutral colours and lightweight clothing .

The U.S. is filled with magnificent sights and smells " and so is our northern neighbor . You might not think of Canada as exotic and exciting , but even just north of its southern border , the country boasts plenty of places that enliven and enthuse . You do n't have to travel far to find adventure , and these five fantastic Canadian spots prove it . <h> 1 . Derby Line " Stanstead <p> According to legend , the surveyors assigned to this area of Vermont were drunk on the job . However it happened , the border between Derby Line , Vermont and Stanstead , Quebec is essentially a row of potted plants " quite unlike other American borders , which tend to be manned by armed guards and dogs .

Windsor <p> While Derby Line and Stanstead might remain divided into its north and south halves , Windsor , Ontario is a Canadian town that lies south of the U.S. border . Indeed , just south of Detroit " across the Detroit River " you 'll find a fantastic mix of American and Canadian cultures . While it has a handful of year-round attractions , like a Canadian whiskey distillery and a few scenic hikes , Windsor is especially amazing to visit in early July . Canada Day ( July 1 ) is swiftly followed by Independence Day ( July 4 ) , creating a week of festivals and fireworks .

Nearby Niagara Falls hotels offer other attractions as well , including indoor water parks , an expansive arcade , and award-winning restaurants .

@@107143257 @2543257/ <h> How to visit London on the cheap <p> London is rumored to be notoriously expensive and the British Pound Sterling is usually very strong , making it more expensive to visit this exciting metropole for almost any nationality . Most visitors struggle to keep their costs low when exploring Englands capital , but there are a few secrets to traveling to London on the cheap . In todays post , I am sharing my best travel tips to stick to a shoestring London travel budget : <h> Be smart with public transportation <p> Public transportation will probably be your biggest expensive while you 're in London , but there are some ways to save money on buses and subways . First of all , pick up an Oyster Card instead of paying for single rides each time " trust me , you 'll need one . There is a -5 deposit for the card itself , but you 'll get it back when you leave and return the card . <p> 1 . Get an Oyster Card <p> You have two choices when you buy an Oyster Card : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you can simply add money to the card . That way , the pay as you go ' version , is cheaper if you do n't plan to take a lot of trips during the day ( but if you are staying not right in Central London , it 's very likely that you 'll be using public transportation every day ) . With the Pay As You Go version you 'll pay only -2.30 per ride instead of the full -4.80 fare for a single ticket . <p> If you opt for the Pay As You Go option , your daily fare will be capped at -6.40 ( in Zone 1 &amp; 2 , Central London ) , which is the price of a day ticket . A day is counted until 3am the next morning , by the way . If you 're wondering how much money to put on your card : -20 will usually cover a return- journey from Heathrow plus travel around Central London for one 1 or 2 days . If you are planning to stay for 3 to 4 days , put -30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can always put more on it . If you 're spending an entire week in London , your cheapest option is the 7-day travel card ( -32.10 vs. -44.80 for 7 daily travel cards ) .2 . Off-peak vs. on-peak <p> If you do n't  want to get an Oyster card , it is still possible to buy ( paper ) travel cards they are considerably more expensive though , with -12 for a day pass ( compared to the -6.40 cap off with an Oyster Card ) . If you 're a late riser , opt for a off-peak travel card , which is cheaper than a normal travel card but only allows you to travel after 9.30am , however there is n't a difference in all travel cards for example you pay the same price for an off-peak card in Zone 1 , but if you stay further outside and need a travel card that reaches until Zone 5 , it does make a -5 difference . You can see all the current London fares in this table . <p> 3 . Buses vs. subway <p> You can even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tube " and buses in London are n't the grimy kind you 've got in some U.S. city , but new , clean double-decker buses which connect the places that are n't covered by the subway and train network , but some go on routes parallel to a subway route , and this is when taking the bus is cheaper . A bus ride with an Oyster card is -1.50 , no matter if it 's peak time or not . Also : if you use only buses and use a Pay As You Go Oyster Card , your fare will be capped at -4.40 , which means every day when you reach -4.40 , you 'll ride the rest of the day for free.Sightseeing by local bus <p> Also " taking the bus is a much better way to see the city , so if you 're not pressed for time , I recommend taking the bus whenever possible . While hop-on hop-off tours are a great way to see London , they can cost an arm and a leg ! Instead , there are several London bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are all included in the price of your day ticket or Oyster card ( though there are no headsets , so you might need to do a little background research yourself . <p> One of the buses that goes by many of London 's sights is bus number 9- and you can hop right on in Piccadilly Circus. - The bus passes Trafalgar Square , Somerset House , Harrods , the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in West London , and finishes at St Paul 's Cathedral in East London . <p> Another fabulous route for sightseeing is bus RV1 which runs between Covent Garden and Tower Gateway . You can get on it on either end and the route follows the Thames passing the South Bank with the London Eye , London Bridge and even goes right over the Tower Bridge . <h> Most of London 's attractions are free ! <p> One of my favorite things about London is that most of the city 's attractions are free " including its famous museums , such as the British Museum , the National History Museum or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainy day by the way , and there 'll be one of those most likely ! ) . <p> In addition to the free museums and galleries , you can see many other things that are icon <p> ic London landmarks without paying a penny , such as : <p> Piccadilly Circus <p> Tower Bridge <p> Hyde Park <p> Portobello Road Market &amp; Notting Hill <p> A river walk along the Thames <p> Changing the Guard &amp; the horse guards <p> Big Ben <p> Camden Market and the canals <p> Primrose Hill <p> Trafalgar Square <p> Oxford Street ( stick to window shopping though , or visit Primark ) <p> So while a trip to London can be pricey , if you feel like you have to do things like Madame Tussaud 's , go inside Buckingham Palace , the London Eye or the Shard for views ( which you can get much cheaper when climbing the Monument in the City of London , by the way , which is only -3 , or entirely free if you head up to Primrose Hill or Hampstead Heath ) . <p> Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually give you a great overview of the city , allow you to get your bearings , and at the same time you 'll get some background info and insider tips . Tour guides love to share their knowledge of the city , so do n't be shy if you 're looking for recommendations for a certain kind of cuisine or just a good pub with cheap beer . When you join a free walking tour , you 'll also notice how close most of the city 's attractions are and that most of Central London is surprisingly walkable . I recommend Sandemans New Europe Royal London Tour , a 2.5 hour walk that covers Buckingham Palace , No 10 Downing Street , Trafalgar Square and Nelsons Column , St James Park and the Horseguards , to name just a few stops . <h> Use discount vouchers <p> Before buying anything , check if there are any discount vouchers for the activity , food or drink you 're planning to buy . For example , browse through VoucherBin UK for the latest voucher codes before you set off on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK and many restaurants offer meal deals or 2-for-1 dinner vouchers . There are also vouchers for supermarkets if you 're planning to cook for yourself , and it pays off to compare prices in the main supermarket chains ( Tesco 's , Sainsbury 's and Waitrose ) to see which one has the items you 're planning to buy on offer . <h> How to save money on paid attractions <p> If you 're planning to see some of London 's attraction that are n't free , consider getting a London Pass which includes over 60 London attractions , including a Thames River Cruise , the Tower Of London and Westminster Abbey . Tip : If you buy the pass through VisitLondon , the official tourist board , you 'll get a 10% discount on it . <p> If you only plan to visit one or two of the paid-for attractions , check online if they offer an advance booking discount . Most of the attractions offer it " the London Eye for example is 20% cheaper if booked in advanced . <p> If you 're planning a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brighton for example , you should also check out the National Rail website where you 'll usually find 2-for-1 offers for all major attractions ( if you buy a train ticket ) . Train tickets should be purchased in advance , too , by the way : a ticket to Brighton is -22.90 if you buy it on the spot , but it can be as cheap as -11 if you buy it a few weeks in advance . This kind of travel requires planning , but it makes a huge difference on your wallet . <h> Cheap West End Theater Tickets <p> Theater is a fix part of many London visitors ' itinerary , and seeing a play in the West End is well worth the splurge . The best part is that seeing a play or musical does n't need to be expensive " I 've seen plays for as little as -20 ! Similar to New York , London also has discount ticket booths " head to the TKTS ticket booth in the afternoon to get discounted tickets for the same evening . The Guardian just published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West End Theater Tickets . <h> Food and drinks <p> First of all : do n't ever spend water on bottled water when you are in London . The tap water in the city is perfectly fine and safe to drink , and not only will it save you some precious Pounds , but you 'll also do the environment a favor . <p> For a cheap lunch , head to Tesco , Sainsbury 's or Boots and pick up one of their lunch deals , which are as little as -3 and include a sandwich , a drink and an additional item ( chips , fruit or something sweet ) . It does n't get any cheaper than this ! If you prefer a hot lunch , head to EAT or Pret A Manger for a hot sandwich or a soup . You can get either one for less than -5 .

@@107143258 @2543258/ <h> Polaroid of the week : A breathtaking Tel Aviv sunset <p> You might remember that I really wanted to spend a month or longer in Tel Aviv after visiting the city last year , which is why I was stoked when the opportunity arose to return this month , finally , about twelve months after my first visit . I was a bit nervous , not sure if I 'd still love the city as much as I did last year , but I did n't  have anything to worry about . The minute I stepped off the plane and felt the warm Mediterranean air , I knew I 'd have a great time . After checking into my apartment I went straight to the beach to watch the sunrise , followed by a delicious Israeli breakfast . It felt amazing coming from chilly Germany to summery Tel Aviv , where temperatures were still in the 80s and the Med was warm enough to go for swims in the sea . <p> Being in Tel Aviv on a budget challenge was an interesting experience on the one hand I realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand I found a ton of free stuff to do ( I 'll be sharing my budget tips for Tel Aviv shortly ) . My favorite free activity ? The beaches , no question ! Every day in Tel Aviv has to involve a visit to the beach ideally during sunset , or a long run along the promenade . The agenda for my second visit ? I wanted to revisit old favorites but also experience a few things I did n't  get around to doing last year . I strolled through the narrow alleys of Jaffa again , took in the vistas over the city from there , had what is supposedly the best hummusin allof Israel ( and I can now confirm that it really is the best hummus in Israel ! ) and visited the amazing Ilana Goor art museum ( a first for me , and so worth it ) . I also made time for a visit to Carmel market , a walk down the beautiful Rothschild Boulevard , and for some gift and souvenir shopping in Jaffa Flea Market . <p> Last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art tour in the Florentine neighborhood I was keen on checking out this time , I got was able to join it and it was fantastic ! Its run by Guy Sharret , who also hosts the StreetWise Hebrew podcast which I love , and I got to see so much more street art than I wouldve found on my own , even though I was staying in Florentine . Speaking of this cool neighborhood : I also got a taste of the nightlife in this area of Tel Aviv , I visited some of the gay and lesbian bars I did n't  make it to on my first trip , and I joined the superb Tel Aviv pub crawl ( because I still had great memories of the pub crawl in Jerusalem I went on last year ) . Another first : renting a Tel-O-Fun bike , a public bike sharing program similar to New Yorks Citibikes or Londons Santander Cycles . For only ILS17 ( US$4.50 ) per 24 hours , they turned out to be the best way to get around the city on the budget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made new friends , got an invitation to try kite-boarding next time I 'm in town ( check out the awesome KB4girls if you plan a visit to Israel ) , and I am already contemplating my next trip to Tel Aviv . I still feel I have only scratched the surface of all the great things the city has to offer , and once again I have to say : Tel Aviv deserves a longer visit , and I hope I can make a extended stay there happen rather sooner than later . 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Catching up with your blog and glad to see you are back in Tel Aviv . I still have so many fond memories of Israel and just cant wait to go back soon . Look forward to hear more experiences .

With a fantastic art scene , more coffee shops and restaurants you could possibly try , vibrant nightlife and plenty of outdoorsy activities on and along the river ( cycling , kayaking , running , swimming ) . Brisbane deserves a few days of exploration , if not even longer . And not just the city itself is worth spending some time in , but also the area around Brisbane . There are beaches and isles , wildlife , national parks for hiking , mountains to climb and the fabulous Granite Belt Wine region . My recommendation would be basing yourself in the city , rent serviced apartments in Brisbane for example , and use it as a jump-off point to explore Southern Queensland and nearby Northern New South Wales . <p> There is a plethora of things to do around Brisbane , from stunning sights such as the Glow Worm Caves at Tamborine Mountain or the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country towns .

It is connected to a mainland by a bridge , making it super easy to get there by car ( it takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes ) . Most of the island is uninhabited national park , and In addition to relaxing on the beach , you can go on a fishing trip , or tour the National Park to spot some of Australia 's amazing wildlife such as kangaroos , kookaburras and goannas. <h> 7 Sunshine Coast <p> A visit to the Sunshine Coast is something you ca n't miss if you 're in Brisbane in the summer .

New York City is known to be a foodie paradise after all , with ethnic restaurants from almost every country in the world . <p> One of the many things I love about New York is that the choice of restaurants is so big that even if I tried I could n't try all of the city 's eateries ( or I would have to make that my life quest ) . I ate my way around town this year , sampling restaurants in all boroughs except for Staten Island ( I guess that 's next on my list ! ) , ticking places off my seemingly endless NYC restaurants I have to eat at ' list . I found so many excellent restaurants in 2014 that this list could easily have twenty restaurants on it , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borough ( but ended up with two Brooklyn picks , because I skipped Staten Island and Brooklyn is my favorite borough ) . <p> My beloved Shakshuka read on to find out where to find the best one ! <p> Join me for a culinary world tour of New York : <h> Middle Eastern : Bustan in Upper Manhattan <p> Bustan ( which means orchard in Hebrew ) , is a new addition to Manhattan 's large number of Middle Eastern restaurants , but this one aims to be the most authentic one , and I have to say that they are doing a great job in convincing me that I do n't ever need to go to another place to get my hummus and shakshuka fix . The Israeli chef with Moroccan roots aims to combine flavors , ingredients and cooking techniques from Israel , Italy , France , Spain , Morocco , Greece and Turkey . The highlight for me was that Bustan does not just offer a classic shakshuka ( the quintessential Israeli egg dish with eggs baked into a flavorful tomato sauce ) , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artichoke sauce instead of the classic tomato sauce , a Greek version with shrimps and feta cheese , or one with chicken and foie gras . The homemade hummus melted in my mouth , and the flat bread , served fresh out of the oven , was to die for ( see photo above ) my Israeli friend who joined me for brunch assured me that the hummus was just as good as in a restaurant in Tel Aviv and started calling some of her Israeli friends while we were still there to rave about Bustan which goes to show how authentic the food was . Even though we were bursting full , we could n't resist the Nutella pizza to finish off our meal . Another bonus of Bustan : It offers brunch on Fridays , not only the weekend " which is a rarity in New York . <p> Address : 487 Amsterdam Ave , Manhattan , 10024 <h> Italian : Zero Otto Nove in the Bronx <p> It is a known fact that the real Little Italy is located in the Bronx , and not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there to check out some of the famed restaurants and pastry shops . Everyone recommended Zero Otto Nove ( 089 ) as the absolute best Italian restaurant and the restaurant lived up to the hype . I had a foodgasm when I took my first bite of the classic Italian-style wood fired pizza , which had a unique twist to it : a butternut squash puree as a base , instead of tomato sauce . Most of the ingredients , like the mozzarella , the tomatoes and the olive oil , are imported directly from Italy . The pastas and other dishes were just as good as the pizza , by the way , and the Parmigiana Di Melanzana is made to perfection , but I recommend ordering the La Ricardo or a Margarita in addition to anything else you might have . <p> Address : 2357 Arthur Avenue , Bronx , NY 10458 <h> Latin American : Areperia Guacuco in Brooklyn <p> Bushwick , just a few years back an i 'll famed neighborhood in Brooklyn , has recently become quite a trendy neighborhood ( and recently even got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants started popping up around the hood in the past few years . The little Venezuelan restaurant Areperia Guacuco is the perfect example of the gentrification of Bushwick : while it seems to cater to the neighborhoods Latin population , prices are definitely more on the Manhattan side ( $7 $8 for a tiny arepa ) . It is money well spent though the arepas sold here cant get any more authentic . The classic Venezuelan staple basically pastries , made from cornmeal and water , fried in oil , are made fresh for each individual customer and fillings range from veggie options to the classic sweet &amp; savory version with black beans , shredded beef and fried plantains . Accompanied by typical Venezuelan drinks like papel+n con l+mon ( lemonade with molasses ) or a cocada ( coconut milkshake ) . Not to be missed when you find yourself in Bushwick , but also well worth the trip out there . <p> Address:44 Irving Ave , Brooklyn , NY11237 <h> Australian : The Thirsty Koala in Queens <p> The Astoria neighborhood in northern Queens has long been known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but surprisingly enough it is where I had my first taste of Australian food ! My friend who took me to The Thirsty Koala assured me that the Aussie food served here was the real deal , and she would know after spending a year working her way around Australia .. The Thirsty Koala did n't  disappoint : the items on the menu could come straight from a menu from a restaurant Down Under and range from kangaroo steaks or kangaroo burgers to a number of fish dishes , lamb lollies , jaffles ( savory sandwiches ) and octopus tacos . If you 're looking for Aussie food in NYC , this is the most authentic restaurant you 'll find , and every Aussie expat will feel right at home here ! <p> Address : 3512 Ditmars Blvd , Astoria , NY <p> Areperia Guacuco in Bushwick <h> Japanese : Yamato in Brooklyn <p> I was introduced to Yamato while I was living in Brooklyn near Prospect Park , and felt like I won the Asian restaurant jackpot . It 's rare to find an Asian restaurant that satisfied all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and noodles , but Yamato does all of them exceptionally well . Between me and my companion , we sampled basically all the classic Japanese dishes and I wanted to go back the very next day while I was still daydreaming about the dinner from the night before . The vegetarian sushi was absolutely heavenly and I have yet to find another place that makes dumplings as good as Yamato . While Japanese restaurants tend to overlook vegetarians when creating their menus , Yamato is a welcome exception and my pescatarian friend was raving about the fish dishes and her Bento Box . Yamato does n't  only do food exceptionally well , by the way , but also the restaurants decor is absolutely superb you would n't expect such a chic interior from the unassuming outside . If you happen to visit during the warmer months , you can dine in the backyard patio . <p> Address : - 168 7th Ave , Brooklyn , NY 11215 <h> Indian : Junoon in Midtown Manhattan <p> Junoon is the Urdu word for passion , and passion is what describes best what Delhi-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Junoon is the perfect restaurant to celebrate a special occasion as well as Indian food , with impeccable service , phenomenal presentation and an award-winning wine list ( a selection of 300 wines ! ) and dishes cooked to perfection , like the much-prasied lamb chops . Junoon is , in fact , one of only a handful restaurants in New York that are known for professionally pairing Asian dishes with Western wines , and if you decide to splurge on the tasting menu + wine pairing ( $75 with meat/seafood , $65 for the vegetarian option , plus $45 for the wine pairing ) , rest assured that you are in for a real treat . <p> Address : 27 W 24th St , New York , NY 10010 <p> Got a favorite ethnic restaurant in New York that you think I need to try ?

See , travel planning in the Philippines is not easy . You have to plan well in advance , something that I 'm just not good at . I prefer rocking up to a place , see if I like it , if so , I stay , if not , I move on . What if I fall in love with Palawan and four nights are n't  enough ? But I have a plan ticket and am forced to leave ? Since the Philippines are an island nation , you have to fly to most places . The islands that are close together are easy to hop around by ferry , which does n't  cost that much , but plane tickets are a bit more pricey unless you book them well in advance . Booking a plane ticket only a couple of days prior to your flight is expensive , as it turns out.I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Manila , but when I finally settled on a date to fly to Palawan , flights were outrageously expensive . So I had a few days to kill until there was a flight that was affordable , and luckily I was on Bohol at the time , just a short ferry ride from Siquijor , an island Carla had suggested I should check out.As soon as I stepped off the boat , I was glad I came it was the perfect island paradise . What a welcome ! Upon researching what there was to do in Siquijor , I had come across several travel writers who were comparing Siquijor with Boracay before it became the crowded , touristy island it is these days . Wide deserted beaches , barely any tourists , only a few hotels scattered along the shore , no chain restaurant in sight.I teamed up with two Swiss guys to find a place to stay and a tricycle driver offered to take us to a few places . Each and every one had a backyard like this:It was love at first sight . While the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful Royal Cliff Resort , our driver dropped me off at Czars Place since my preferred choice , JJs ( with a beachfront bar and hangout area ) was fully booked . Czars was fine , and actually perfectly located across the street from the fabulous Baha Bar , a brand new restaurant that had only been open for three weeks when I was on the island , and quickly became my local hangout , thanks to the veggie-friendly and creative menu , real coffee and glorious ocean views ( and it has beach access as well , its just a question of time until they add a couple of bungalows , I think ) . <p> Our tricycle driver Tata asked me if I wanted to tour the island with him the next day , offering me his tour guide and driver services . Since I was still too afraid to get back on a motorbike by myself ( after a bad accident in Thailand a few years ago ) , I agreed . At first I was bummed that I could n't just rent a motorbike and set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorbike rental rates are around 300 pesos/ US$6.68 ) and would give me the freedom to stop wherever I want , whenever I want and for how long I want , but I ended up appreciating having a local guide when we sped down the ring road around the island the following day.I was able to observe island life , not having to worry about directions and could take selfies of us ( those are the situations selfie-sticks are for , right ? ) . I also enjoyed the little insights he gave me on life in Siquijor , which is pretty much still a fishermens island . He told me about peoples priorities : everyone saves up for a TV ( and pretty much everyone owns one ) , but a washing machine is a luxury that only wealthy people have . And indeed I saw many women doing their laundry the old-fashioned way : in the streams we passed , scrubbing their clothes on a rock . <p> Coconut production is big on Siquijor <p> Tata does n't  need a bank account and has no idea how an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Life is simple in Siquijor , an island known for its healing powers and witchcraft.There are still many mangkukulam ( sorcerers ) on the island today who brew traditional ointments for all sorts of sickness and people come here especially for them , and rumor has it that they do n't  only cure pain and illnesses , but they are also able to fix heartbreak , and if necessary , take out a competitor , heal jealousy or use some magic to prevent a divorce , which is not legal in the strictly Catholic Philippines ( but black magic on the other hand is n't strictly Catholic , which is why it is not much talked about ) . I did n't  see a single healer but I healed my blistered feet in the fish spa right under the 400 year old enchanted balete tree that is known as Siquijors most majestic landmark . And majestic it was , with its massive branches forming a canopy that offers shade for half of the man-made pools below the tree . Standing next to it made me feel tiny ! The pools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural source under the tree , which is why the locals believe that the waters , coming from this special tree ( the oldest one in the region ) , has mystical powers.I am not sure if its special powers enchanted me , but my feet sure felt good after the fish nibbled on them.From there , we went to the- Cambugahay Falls which seems to be a favorite not only with tourists but with locals as well . At the waterfalls you have a series of pools in which you can swim and even swing-jump into the water from a long rope , , tarzan-style . I could have spent the rest of the day there , but Tata had some other sights he wanted me to see.We stopped at the nearby Lazi Church , a remnants of the Spanish who built this church ( and adjoining convent ) in 1884 , which is now one of the very few remaining Baroque churches in the Philippines , and a candidate for UNESCO World Heritage site status.Tata took me to the hidden Kagusaan Bay where we only saw two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I cant tell you the name of it.Our last stop for the day was Salagdoong Beach , an official government beach where we had to pay an entrance fee ( PHP45 / US$1 ) .

But when the least pretty stop looks like this , you know that you 've had a very good day:We passed- goats , cows , banana plantations , small wooden houses on the side of the road , rice fields and only very few other motorbikes . Had I been brave enough to get back on a motorcycle , this island would have actually been the perfect place to do it and to slowly ease into it again.I spent my time on the island with walks on the beach , watching the local fishermen walk out to their boats in the afternoon so that the fish that 's grilled in front of every restaurant in the evening is as fresh as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I headed over to JJs to mingle with other travelers , and its actually here where a girl suggests my next stop : Apo Island ! This meant that I did n't  get to spend as much time on Siquijor as it deserves , but wait for my next post and you 'll see why I had to follow her recommendation.I did n't  leave the island without one big party though : Surprisingly , it turned out that Czars was the literal center of the party on Friday night when a stage was erected in the backyard , a live band was announced , and later that night half the island and seemingly all of the tourists who were around showed up for a massive dance party . The window of my room was facing the stage , so I basically had no chance but to join the party .. Sleeping with the music blaring would have been impossible but I do n't  think I ever need an excuse to dance =This dance party was a rare exception on the otherwise very quiet island Siquijor is anything but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back life there . I am still grateful for the overpriced flights to Palawan , because without them , I would have never gotten to know this island paradise . 129333 @qwx989333 <p> If you 're visiting Siquijor and would use the lovely Tata as your driver , you can call him at 09351927656 . He has a motorbike and a tuktuk ( which fits for ) and can organize motorbike rentals , too . A motorbike tour with him is PHP700 ( US$15.86 ) , - tuktuk tour is PHP1,000 ( US$22.23 ) . <p> You can get to Siquijor via ferry ( 45 minutes , PHP210 / US$4.76 ) from Dumaguete on nearby Negros Oriental . Dumaguete has an airport with regular flights to Manila , or you can take a ferry to Cebu or Bohol from here . <p> Rooms start at 400 PHP / in the basic guesthouses . Casa Miranda near San Juan seems to be the cheapest option with rooms starting at PHP250 / US$5.60 and rooms with kitchen facilities &amp; fridge for PHP50. , JJs is PHP350 / US$7.80 for a dorm ( they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the places I looked at , seemed very nice and had a 4-person room for PHP1,800 .

I thought you had to go through Dumaguete , which is the main reason I never got there ! Ah man , I totally feel like I missed out . Siquijor is number one my list for when I go back to the Philippines . It looks and sounds like such an amazing little island and totally unlike anywhere else in the Philippines ! <p> Justine I shouldve made that clearer .. you 're right , you cant get to Siquijor from Bohol , but it was still much closer than , say Malapascua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under 3 hours , that 's why I jumped on it . Its such a beautiful little island definitely worth adding it to your next Philippines itinerary . <p> Totally agree with you ! We are still at Siquijor , and we have a hard time leaving the island . We are enjoying our 5th day now here . Too bad we 've missed you . Would be nice sharing some experiences . We actually stayed at Royal Cliff Resort the last 4 days . Great place with lovely staff . Good for snorkelling right in front of the place . <p> Corinne oh , I am so jealous right now .. you 're in Siquijor ! It wouldve been nice to meet you there but maybe our paths will cross elsewhere in the world = So funny that you were staying at the Royal Cliff Resort ! ! <p> Several reasons came together , but above all it was just wanting to live a healthy lifestyle . I should have actually said we are 99.5% ers , as I did have a couple things with meat in the last year , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete change and we could n't be happier ! <p> Siquijor is the best ! Truly a wonderful island , I 'm glad you made it there ( and to Apo Island ! ) . But I have to disagree with you about getting around the Philippines without planning . If one has ample time and does n't  mind buses and boats , it is possible to get just about everywhere without flying . Some of the boats only operate once or twice a week so its a country where one really needs time and flexibility OR advance planning and plane tickets if time is short . Regardless , great post that transported me right back to that wonderful little island ! <p> Marbree yes , I agree that it is possible to get around without flying , but it took one of my friends five days to get from Boracay to El Nido via boat . I just did n't  have that kind of time . The ferry to Manila from El Nido wouldve taken almost three days . That 's why I had to fly , I wouldve preferred the adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many places I wanted to see I was pretty strapped for time but I 'll be back soon to see what I missed this time around = <p> It looks like you found it ! ( The magic ) When Tom and I went to the Philippines we spent the whole 3 weeks in Palawan because , as you said , it is time-consuming and/or expensive to get around ! That one tiny taste of the 7,000 islands that make up the archipelago made us anxious to go back one day . We will have to visit Siquijor when we finally do . <p> Its definitely a magical place ! I hope you 'll make it to Siquijor when you return to the Philippines ( I 'm sure you will ! ) , Jenny ! I did n't  make it on a Tao excursion this time ( too short notice , flights already booked .. ) , btw , but that is on my wish list for my next trip to the Philippines = <p> I just found your blog it is amazing ! I am traveling to the Philippines in Feb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired us to go there ! Just wondering how long you would recommend staying there for ? <p> Hi Serica , yay , Siquijor ! Loved it so much . To see the island , three island would be enough , ( 2 full days of exploring ) , but if you want an additional beach day , you could also stay another day . Enjoy the Philippines = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107143265 @2543265/ <h> Five Tips To Prevent Car Repairs When Traveling In Your Own Car <p> One thing that came up several times recently while discussing potential travel plans with potential travel buddies was the topic of buying a car . A friend of mine would love to go on a U.S. road trip with me but not just any road trip , a road trip of epic proportions like this one recently featured in the Washington Post , with 50 stops in all 48 Lower States . A road trip like this would take us at least three months , and we were talking about buying a used car for it rather than paying exorbitant rental fees plus insurance . I 've often seen used cars on sale for less than $2,000 , which would be pretty much the same you 'd pay for a rental for that amount of time and you can sell the car afterwards if you treat it with care . <p> Road tripping in the U.S. <p> Another place where buying a car instead of renting one is popular is Australia . My friends recently returned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they had bought a used camper van . Buying a camper van for a road trip is a common thing to do for travelers who are planning to tour the country extensively and it makes total sense , just think about all the money you can save by sleeping in the van ! My friends were able to sell the van afterwards which made their trip even cheaper . <p> The car I 'd buy for a road trip = <p> There are some things to consider when investing money in a used car that is supposed to drive thousands of miles . The same goes for a rental car by the way if you 're planning an epic road trip through Australia in a rental car , you want to make sure you treat it exceptionally well to avoid breakdowns and unforeseen repairs . Lonely Planet has an excellent guide to buying a used camper van in Australia from where you can find used cars to things to consider when buying a car and which features to pay attention to . GumTree also has a great guide on buying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth checking out . <p> To avoid additional costs for unnecessary repairs , make sure to follow my five top tips to prevent breakdowns or the car stop working : <h> 1 ) Check Your Timing Belt <p> This is probably the most important thing you can do , especially if you 're traveling in an older car and especially if you have only just bought it . The damage that can be done to a car when a timing belt breaks is often fatal , or at the very least cripplingly expensive . Vehicle manufacturers have different rules on when a timing belt should be changed . On some cars it can be as soon as 40,000 miles , but the average is around 60,000 miles . If you do n't know for sure that the belt has been changed you can save yourself a lot of money by taking the car into a garage and have it checked . <p> Its important to check your car regularly or have it serviced . <h> 2 ) Get Regular Servicing <p> There are good reasons for having your car serviced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can affect the smooth running of any car . The air filter is designed to stop contaminants and debris being sucked into the engine and , if this gets clogged , it affects the fuel to air ratio and your car will start to run badly or may lose power . Dirty oil will also compromise the efficient running of the car , as the oil picks up contaminants such as carbon and metal particles when it travels around the engine . A clogged oil filter will eventually not be able to clean the oil , so regular oil and filter replacement is the least you can do to keep the car running smoothly . Since you 'll be driving the car a lot , a regular checkup is absolutely essential . <h> 3 ) Watch out for Rust <p> The easiest way to keep the car looking pristine is to wash it regularly . Road grime , salt and grit cause corrosion , so be sure to wash these away on a regular basis and check around the bodywork for minor chips and scratches at the same time . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxidise and worsen as there 's nothing worse than a rusty looking vehicle , and you wo n't get much money for it when it comes time to sell ! <p> Nobody wants a rusty car ! <h> 4 ) Invest In A Code Reader <p> There are a number of simple to use On-Board Diagnostic tools on the market now . Some of them even allow you to do health checks on your car . For example , a warning light on the dashboard can mean any number of problems , whereas a code reader can help you make sense of what the problem is and can help avoid a problem becoming worse by alerting you to what it is. <h> 5 ) Check Your Fluid Levels <p> You can avoid many problems by doing this yourself and your car 's handbook will show how to do this . Check that the oil level does n't get too low and top it up if needed but , at the same time , check the brake fluid , steering fluid levels and the water level in the radiator expansion tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car every day , I 'd recommend checking your fluid levels once a week . <h> 2 Comments <p> I always love seeing what other people do before they go away in their car on a long road trip to stay safe and accident free because maybe ..

Which led me to think about the items I 'd actually appreciate , and the items I 'd recommend as gifts for travelers . So if you 're still looking for gift ideas , or get the question What do you want for Christmas ?

This does n't  even need to be expensive , considering that budget airlines around Europe offer flights for as little as 20 Euros and Norwegian offers transatlantic flights for less than $200 . Just look up gift vouchers plus the airline of your choice and you 'll be able to purchase them on the website of the respective airline . <h> 2 Travelcard Portable Charger <p> I 've had my fair share of portable chargers for iPhone and other USB devices , but I did n't  love any of them too clunky , too short-lived , too impractical . The Travelcard charger , however , might just be the perfect portable charger : At the size of a credit card , I can charge my phone while putting the Travelcard right underneath it , and almost not even feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected via a long cord . The Travelcard comes with its own short lightning cable , which means that even if I do n't  have my charger cord with me ( I tend to forget it ) , I can charge my phone . I gifted this to one person already and it was a huge hit if you have any phone addicts in your family , this is the absolute best gift . For me as a traveler , it is invaluable , considering I spend a lot of time on buses , planes and trains and hate running out of battery . <h> 3 Sholdit Scarf <p> I was ecstatic when I first heard about the Sholdit : a scarf that has a secret pocket for my valuables ! This is just genius . I always worry about where to put my most valuable and beloved things ( passport , iPhone , wallet ) , especially when I am on long bus rides or when I want to just run out to pick up a coffee without having to take my entire purse or backpack . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not obvious that I am hiding stuff in the infinity scarf . The hidden zipper pocket holds almost as many things as a small ladys purse : a thick wallet , passport , cash , phone and other small items that you might need , like lip gloss , the Travel Card charger I mentioned above , chewing gum or mints and travel-size lotion . <p> The scarves come in different colors and styles , so that they are not only practical , but also chic . I am much less worried about pickpockets on buses when I wear it and I am not freaked out about falling asleep on trains anymore now that I have my valuables close to my heart , quite literally ! If you 're not sure which style is the best fit for your friend or family member , you can also purchase a gift card on the website. <h> 4 A cool guidebook <p> I am traveling without a guidebook for the very first time here in Sri Lanka and I do n't  like it at all .

I even still use a guidebook when I am in New York , a city I have come to known much better than any other city in the world , but a guidebook usually gives me some ideas for new places , hidden gems or simply things that I have n't had on my radar yet . This year I was introduced to a guidebook series I had n't known previously " the Knowing Where Youre Going guidebooks . They are formatted beautifully , have excellent maps ( I love their design ! ) and plenty of great tips for neighborhoods to explore , self-guided walks to try , and lots of interesting facts about both the major tourist attractions and lesser known places . <p> Other guidebook series I like include the DK Eyewitness Guides , Rough Guide and Footprint , which have guidebooks for most countries and cities . I still buy Lonely Planet guidebooks , although I find their region guides ( like the South America one ) increasingly outdated and disappointing , but the city and country guides are better researched and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made several ones of those myself this year , for family and friends , and everybody loved them !

I 've found great deals for photo books on Groupon and Amazon Local ( just type photo books ' in the search box ) and so far I 've always been impressed with the quality of the books . When you purchase a photo book through Groupon , they are as little as $8.99 for a 20-pages hardcover book , and there is a gift option when you buy them , which means you can actually give a voucher for the book to the traveler in your family , and they can make a book themselves with their favorite pictures of their last trip .

@@107143271 @2543271/ <h> Where to stay in Hong Kong : The LKF by Rhombus <p> When I started my research for outstanding hotels in Hong Kong , one of the first hotels that caught my attention was the Pennington by Rhombus , a sleek boutique hotel right in the center of the Causeway Bay shopping area on Hong Kong Island . The best part was that it was not only sleek , but also affordable , but that meant it was in high demand and did n't have availability for my dates.However , while further researching the hotel , I discovered that the Pennington was part of the Rhombus group which had three more hotels in Hong Kong " the Bonaparte , Hotel Panorama and Hotel LKF . LKF stands for Lan Kwai Fong , which is a popular nightlife area in Hong Kong , and so I did n't need to think long : I wanted to stay there , right in the middle of Lan Kwai Fong , a neighborhood made up of a maze of little streets and alleyways that are home to more than 90 restaurants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and classic theme of the hotel which runs like a thread through the entire hotel , from the lobby to the rooms and the stunning rooftop bar ( more on this later ) . All rooms at the LKF are equipped with illy espresso coffee machines and tea making facilities , a 42-inch LCD TV ( which admittedly I did n't have time to switch on once ! ) , mini bar and comfy bathrobes and slippers . For a city like Hong Kong , where space is sparse , the rooms are unusually large " the superior rooms are an enormous 500 square feet and the suites are almost twice as big with a size of 950 square feet.The spacious bathroom does n't only come with high-quality toiletries , a hairdryer and a scale , but also with a bathtub , and indulging in a bubble bath after a long day of sightseeing felt glorious.My favorite feature of the room ? This would be a tie between the incredible views over Hong Kong and the super comfy king size bed that made me wish I had an extra day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have left the bed " the crisp cotton linens and Flexi pillows lulled me into a sound sleep as soon as I hit the sheets after a late night cocktail at the Azure Bar on the 30th floor of the hotel.While I did n't have time to try the restaurant up there , I had to at least take in the night views over the city at Azure , which was ranked as one of The World 's 20 Best Sky Bars ' . Azure sure lived up to my expectation , even though it was rather quiet on the weekday evening I visited , but I can imagine how busy it gets on a weekend night . And have I mentioned these views ? If Azure is n't enough to quench your thirst for a good night out , fear not : staying at LKF means that you literally have dozens of restaurants and bars right at your doorstep . Lan Kwai Fong is by far the best neighborhood to be in if you are looking to sample Hong Kong 's nightlife , or just to eat your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here also means that you are in walking distance to Central 's endless shopping facilities and the yummy eateries of the trendy Sheung Wan neighborhood . I also walked up to the Peak from the LKF , which was an excellent workout thanks to the steep hills , and the road up the hill is easy to follow from the hotel.If you prefer a more conventional workout , the LKF has a small , but functional gym , to make sure you wo n't feel too guilty when indulging in the fabulous breakfast buffet , which is served in the Azure restaurant every morning " no better way to start the day than with these sweeping views and a buffet style breakfast that includes fresh fruit , yogurt , a selection of bread , and hot dishes.Speaking of views " almost all of the rooms have stunning views , and the large panoramic windows allow you to fully enjoy them . Overall , I could n't have asked for a better experience and even though I was looking hard for things I thought could use some improvement , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a bit bigger.The LKF was named one of Asia 's Top 5 Business Hotels ' , has received several Certificate Of Excellence Awards ' by TripAdvisor , won Best Boutique Hotel ' , Best Business Hotel ' , Trendiest Hotel in China ' , to name just a few , and these awards are well deserved " the topnotch facilities and excellent service make staying here a stress-free , pleasant experience that I 'd like to award with the Globetrottergirls Stamp Of Approval ! 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143272 @2543272/ <h> Rolling on a river : A different way to experience Europe <p> A trip to Europe is on most peoples bucket lists , and whenever I hear people plan out their hectic multi-country itineraries , I ca n't help but feel sorry for them : trying to fit in as many cities as possible in a couple of weeks , their schedules usually leave no time for relaxation . Over the last few years , scenic river cruises have gained in popularity rapidly and there 's a good reason for that . I remember how much we loved getting around Southern Europe hassle-free on our Mediterranean cruise , waking up in a new country every day and never having to pack up and leave our room , being well-fed and having some downtime while the ship was pulling into or out of a port . <p> Loreley by Mike Powell on Flickr.com <p> River cruises are still much less crowded than the well-worn path of the giant cruise ships that traverse the Mediterranean day after day , week after week . <p> Still not convinced ? Here are some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your next trip to Europe : <h> 1 . Get off the beaten path <p> This would be the biggest draw for me , especially in the summer months , when trains , buses and budget flights are packed with anyone from gap year backpackers to Asian tour groups who are all doing the same ol Europe tour : Rome , Barcelona , Paris , Amsterdam , Berlin , Prague and Budapest . What this means ? Endless lines to see the main attractions , inflated hotel prices and being ripped off at least once , no matter of that 's by a tourist restaurant or a smart scam artist . <p> If you go on a river cruise instead , you 'll get the same classic Europe experience , but you 'll stop in lesser known towns which does n't  mean they 're less visit-worthy but just lesser known on an international level . Rhine and Danube river cruises are particularly attractive , since these two rivers run through a large part of Europe and pass by some of the most gorgeous capitals ( think Vienna , Budapest or Belgrade ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though would assure you that Bamberg for example is a quintessential German town , complete with half-timbered houses , crooked alleyways and cobble-stoned streets . So not only do you get less crowds but also much more interesting stories to tell back home , instead of the same Berlin ? You went to Checkpoint Charlie ? The Brandenburg Gate ? Museum island ? Yeah we did all that too when we were there. <h> 2 . Do something unique <p> A river cruise is a much more exclusive travel experience than a ) a Mediterranean or Caribbean cruise , both of which have lost any feel of exclusivity over the last 15 years and tend to feel more like shepherding sheep these days , and b ) train or bus travel through Europe which will have you either sit in traffic on the highways packed with Europeans on their way to their summer vacation or sweat on a crowded , non-air conditioned train . <p> River cruises have the advantage that the ships are much smaller which gives them an exclusive and elite feel , and the smaller number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience that way . <p> On the Danube above the town of Melk by b k on Flickr.com <h> 3 . Travel stress-free and in comfort <p> As I already mentioned , no matter if you 're taking a bus , a train or evens rental car , there will be stressed involved in one way or another , that 's just unavoidable . Traffic on the highways means uncomfortably long hours on a bus and missing out on sights because you were stuck in a traffic jam somewhere , trains are delayed and not missing a connection somewhere along the way would be a miracle . <p> A river cruise on the other hand gets you everywhere on time , you do n't  need to worry about reading maps or parking and not to mention the scenery you 'll get to enjoy while traveling to your next destination , glass of wine in hand . You 're on vacation after all and you should be able to relax before and after a day of sightseeing . <p> ScenicTours Cruise Ship <h> 4 . Get a special Europe experience <p> A river cruise allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterways are some of the most picturesque in the world , passing medieval castles , vineyards , traditional towns and lush green rolling hills .

We stood on the bank of the Rhine River , stuck out our thumbs and were picked up by one of the many huge Rhine cargo boats within a couple hours .

And the best part is that its more often than not , FREE ! <p> I 've always been turned off of big cruises , but a river cruise does sound like it could be kinda fun .

@@107143273 @2543273/ <h> Our first look at Buenos Aires , through the eyes of a local <p> Less than 24 hours after arriving to Buenos Aires , we were met downstairs from our apartment by Ana , our tour guide for the day . We are staying in the microcentro ' part of the city , the main financial and business district , and on this bustling Friday morning , Ana wants to get us away from the suits and toward some of the more beautiful spots in the city . Her goal , she tells us , is to give us a tour from a local 's perspective , which is just the way we like it . The tour is entirely private , and feels like having a built-in native friend for the day . <p> As always , we have done our research beyond the typical wine , tango and beef Buenos Aires is famous for , but having Ana means being able to ask as may questions as possible to understand just what the Argentine capital is really all about . We prefer to take a tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is especially important for us in Buenos Aires , where we are staying for at least a month . <p> This insider perspective begins right away as we turn onto the Avenida Florida . Crowded and hectic , this tourist-centric pedestrian street is often mentioned as a must-do in Buenos Aires , but as we push through on our way to the famous Plaza de Mayo , Ana tells us about the arbolitos ' or little trees ' . These people who stand on Florida are money-changers , called little trees because of their green leaves , or dollars . She explains the economic situation in the country , the locals ' inability to change pesos into dollars , the current political situation and just how shady doing business with these little trees can be . <p> By the time we get to the Plaza de Mayo , we have learned about the differences between the people of Buenos Aires , known as porte+os , and the rest of Argentina . We learn about the many protests in the city , and looking at the back of the Casa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House in Washington , DC ) we talk in detail about the famous balcony where Eva Peron gave her speech to the people . When we ask Ana about the hunger strike happening on the square , she explains that they are protesting about the Malvinas , or Falkland Islands . There are painted white shawls on the floor around a fountain nearby , which represent the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo , who gather in white on Thursdays , and have done so demanding an answer from the government since their children ( 11,000 in total ) were disappeared ' during the country 's Dirty War from 1976-1983 by state-sponsored terrorism . The conversation goes a bit dark , but that is exactly the kind of straightforward , realistic information we look for , rather than a rosy picture focused on incredible European architecture and delicious food and drink . <p> From here , we venture down into the Subte , the Buenos Aires subway system , for the first time . While we make it a point to master the subway in any city , we really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually take tourists on public transportation . She shows us how to buy tickets and then makes sure we wait for a train to pass in order to get on one of the antique trains , which was like taking a ride on a piece of living history . We would not have known that there is still one line that runs these amazing old-timer trains and it was a really fun intro to the subway system . <p> As our day continues , she also takes us on the bus , which is not exactly a straightforward affair . We are glad to have her lead by example , at least at first . By the time we hop on later that day after the tour , there 's no fumbling for change and we feel like pros . <p> We head to the famous Recoleta cemetery , one of the top three cemeteries in the world . We could have and will spend a whole afternoon here , but Ana 's quick half-hour overview was fascinating . We learned why Evita is buried in a simple black mausoleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loads of insider stories , histories of the people buried here and the cemetery in general , too . Over an ice cream stop nearby to give our legs a rest , we swap travel stories with Ana , who is extremely well-traveled , talking about London and Manhattan while eating typical dulce de leche ' ice cream on a bench across from a building that looks unmistakably Parisian . <p> After another bus ride and a walk up the Avenida Defensa through the bohemian San Telmo , Ana leaves us at Plaza Dorrego , but not before informing us about the antiques market here on Sundays and other markets throughout the city we need to visit . As we take our leave of her , Ana inspires us by telling us what a pleasure it was and about how , no matter where in the world she travels , she remains so proud to show people around her incredible hometown everyday . After exploring Buenos Aires on our own for a week now , we can most certainly understand how the Argentine capital continues to amaze even its locals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our time in Buenos Aires uncovering more local treats that the city has to offer . <p> The private tour is one part of the five-day Buenos Aires experience from CAT Travel , a provider of South America tours , which includes Buenos Aires highlights like tango , walking tours , a trip to an estancia ( ranch ) and even an optional day trip to the popular colonial town La Colonia del Sacramento across the Rio de la Plata in Uruguay , plus other Argentina tours . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 10 Comments <p> I am so glad you guys are enjoying my 2nd home !

One of the largest of the sea lions got cheeky and jumped out of the water up three meters onto the cement platform and gave onlookers a good scare at first .

A good friend of mine and I were supposed to travel together this year , but our plans fell through as my travel plans , as so often , changed . When we were talking about possible plans to travel together next year , she asked me What are your Top Five destinations now ? and it got my thinking : which places are high on my travel wishlist ? And to which of those will I travel next year ? I 'd love to hear what you think of my wishlist , and which places you think I should definitely visit next year please share your thoughts in the comments below and also the places that are high on your travel wishlist.So without further ado my travel wishlist for 2016 : <h> 1 Colombia <p> I 'm starting with this one , because that 's where I 'll be starting my travels next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long Ive been wanting to visit Colombia . It was one of the places I was most excited about to get to when I started traveling in 2010 , making my way down from the US through Mexico to Central America . When I arrived in Panama , I could almost see Colombia on the other side of the Darien Gap , but I never managed to get there , as even back then , an unexpected change in plans and a summer in Europe ended my trip through Latin America at least temporarily . But when I finally set foot on the South American continent , I started in the south , and the furthest north I made it was Peru . So I am ecstatic to finally get there with a delay of only five years = I cant wait to explore the Caribbean coast of Colombia , about which Ive heard great things , the beautiful cobblestone streets and colorful colonial buildings in Cartagena , and hopefully hike the 5-day trek to the Ciudad Perdida , the forgotten ancient city in the jungle . <h> 2 Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South East Asia and never made it to Vietnam . This is something that has to be rectified asap not only to fill the gap in my travel map , but also because I have heard nothing but good things about the country , which is why I want to finally travel around Vietnam . I am obsessed with Vietnamese food , which is another reason why I 'm dying to get to Vietnam , but in addition to the delicious food , I cant wait to see the breathtaking limestone cliffs in Halong Bay in the north , the white sand dunes in Mui Ne in the south , and everything in between . The country is filled with bustling markets , a coastline of over 2,000 miles lined with beaches , excellent trekking in the mountains of Sapa in the northwest , and I have no doubt that I 'll fall hard for Vietnam when I finally get there . <h> 3 South Africa <p> I have to be honest here South Africa was never really on my radar until a lot of travel bloggers whose blogs I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Garden Route that follows the southeastern coast of the country . Many of my friends who have been to South Africa mention Cape Town as one of their absolute favorite cities in the world , and of course I 'd love to go on a wildlife safari in the massive Kruger National Park . <h> 4 Morocco <p> Staying on the African continent , Morocco is a country Ive been wanting to visit ever since watching the indie movie Hideous Kinky with Kate Winslet nearly 20 years ago , in which she travels around Morocco with her two young daughters . Taking the train to Marrakesh , sleeping under the stars in the Sahara Desert , road tripping through the spectacular Atlas Mountains , and taking in fifty shades of blue in the city of Chefchaouen ( take a look for yourself in this beautiful CNN photo essay ) . If I can make this finally happen in 2016 , it would be one of my longest travel dreams come true ! <h> 5 The Baltics <p> Another spot in the world that appeared on my radar thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia look wonderful in photos , and all three capitals , seem like picture perfect with medieval town centers , historic buildings and cobble stone streets . Plus , these three countries are still very cheap to travel in , so I should take advantage of that and visit them while they 're still not on the main tourist trail in Europe . <h> 6 Northern India <p> When I visited India in 2012 , I never made it further north than Goa , which is a shame , since most of Indias most striking provinces and attractions are north of Goas pristine beaches . High on my list of places to see : the desert of Rajasthan , the Golden City of Jaisalmer , the Ghats of Varanasi , the tea country around Darjeeling , and the mountain peaks of the Himalayas . Then there 's the Golden City of Jaipur , and the Taj Mahal of course the list of places I want to see in India is so long that I could spend the better part of the year there and still not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bummed out when I had to cancel my trip to Nepal last month trekking three weeks through the Himalayas along the stunningly beautiful Annapurna Circuit ( check out some pictures in this Washington Post article ) was something I 'd been looking forward to ever since my five-day trek through Perus Andes Mountains in early 2014 . If I can make it to Nepal next year , that would definitely be a highlight of my 2016 travels . <h> 8 Myanmar <p> Another country that has been on my travel wish list for a long time and I had actually planned to visit Myanmar this year but then decided to go to the Philippines instead ( a decision I do NOT regret at all ! ) . The golden Shwedagon Paya stupa in Yangon , the ancient city of Bagan , Inle Lake , the colorful markets I hope that I will finally make it to Myanmar next year . <h> 9 Cuba <p> In 2010 , I almost went to Cuba , but traveling with my girlfriend at the time who was hesitant about entering the country ( we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allowed to travel to Cuba as a U.S. citizen , made us eventually decide against hopping over to Cuba , which is why I still havent made it there . I think Cuba is likely to happen next year , and I cant wait to step back in time in Havana , explore the charming colonial town of Trinidad and enjoy some of the islands Caribbean beaches <h> 10 Mongolia <p> I do n't  think there 's any other country as fascinating as Mongolia with its nomadic culture and families still living in yurts , its rugged wilderness with vast steppes and imposing mountain peaks , and big open skies . Its not necessarily solo female traveler friendly , but luckily its high on my friends travel wish list too , and it would be an unforgettable travel experience for sure . 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 18 Comments <p> Great list ! ! Cuba is on my list too I MUST get there this year . I 'm living in Buenos Aires right now so the list also includes a lot of places around Argentina Patagonia , Salta and the north and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So happy to hear that ! Yes , the area around Salta is a must ! Such an amazing scenery up there . Buenos Aires is a great base for all that how long are you planning to stay there ? So jealous .. wouldve loved to spend longer there than the six weeks we lived there in 2012 ( cant believe its that long ago ! ) <p> I 'm sailing across the Atlantic from Florida to Bermuda then to the Azores , Portugal , Spain , Gibraltar &amp; the Med beginning in May 2016 . Hoping to hit up Morocco &amp; Cuba myself ( the Caribbean on the return- No idea when ! ) Would love to stay in touch and hope our paths cross some day ! Best to you in 2016 ! ! <p> Cristy I love Turkey ! And I definitely want to see more of it . I 've only seen the Turquoise Coast and Istanbul , but I 'm dying to see Cappadocia , for example = As for Chile I just recently wrote about 10 places you should n't miss in Chile , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LONG ... But yes , please get in touch anytime for more specific advice = <p> Great great list ! Do head over to Morocco and spend some time at Sun Desk in Taghazout ! Perfect co-working / co-living space if you need to get something done or want to meet some other nomads ! <p> Mongolia and Myanmar are also great places , just do n't  count on even a decent internet connection in most places . Not sure about Mongolia being a tough spot for solo female travelers independent travel there is generally difficult and most people end up going in groups of three to five people starting in Ulaanbaatar . I only went on trips with Golden Gobi Hostel , but had an amazing time with them and always had solo female travelers as part of the group . <p> Thanks , Mark ! I do n't  think I 'd go to Mongolia solo , but luckily I know another female solo traveler who wants to go = I 'm taking notes though on the Golden Gobi Hostel , that sounds like a great way to do it . Thanks for sharing = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107143281 @2543281/ <h> Hotel Tip of The Week : La Barranca Hostel , Suchitoto , El Salvador <p> Welcome to our weekly series Hotel Tip of The Week . Being on the road every day of the year means we stay at countless hotels along the way . For all the dingy , disappointing budget digs , there are as many budget accommodation gems . We post one hotel tip of the week , every week , of places we feel confident recommending after having tried and tested them ourselves . <p> We had arrived to Suchitoto , El Salvador during a music festival , and while this guaranteed us an eventful time while in town , our only accommodation option the first night was a room at a well-known but sub-par American-owned place . While strolling around town , we came across Villa Balanza restaurant , and as they had received a glowing review in our Footprint guidebook , we decided to sit down here for a bite to eat and ended up booking a room at the hostel for the next night at the same time we paid our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostel with restaurant ( read : bar ) attached . La Barranca is a peaceful hostel set at the bottom of a rather long , steep hill , a five minute walk from the restaurant with views of the major tourist draw , the famous Lake Suchitlan . The way down the hill with luggage is a challenge , even harder is the slog back up after check out , but for those who are reasonably fit ( or have a car ) the serene setting of the accommodation is more than worth it . <p> La Barranca is made up of a two story main house with five bedrooms upstairs over a very homey kitchen and living room downstairs . A second building just behind it houses another five rooms with doors opening out onto a peaceful courtyard with tables and chairs . Staying here feels more like staying in a suburban home , with all the appropriate comforts . The clean , well-decorated rooms have double beds , plenty of space and en-suite bathrooms . ( The bathroom is built into the room , has a saloon-door entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at La Barranca with someone you know fairly well , as you will be sharing your bathroom noises with everyone in the room . ) <p> The kitchen has beautiful mahogany cabinets , a squeaky clean fridge , all the necessary appliances and is roomy enough to fit a decent sized kitchen table with space to host dinner for a few friends. - The living room is equally spacious , with a couch , chairs , a TV , and a computer with internet for those who do not travel with their own laptop . For those who do , including us digital nomads , La Barranca offers free , hi-speed Wi-Fi , which works perfectly everywhere in the main house , fairly well outside in the courtyard , but unfortunately did not reach to the rooms in the second building . <h> Stand Out Feature : The restaurant Villa Balanza <p> As we mentioned , our meal at Villa Balanza hugely influenced our decision to stay at La Barranca , run by the same family. - Set just off of a quiet park five minutes from the Suchitoto 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical Salvadorian food for just pennies more than the street food vendors in town , while the quality of the food would rival any Latin American restaurant in any major city. - The food itself is just one aspect of what Villa Balanza is really setting out to do , which is to define through food , art and history , what it means , and what it has always meant , to be Salvadorian . Hanging over the entryway to Villa Balanza is a large scale ( Balanza ' means balance ' in Spanish ) . On one side sits a 750 pound weapon from the armed forces during the fairly recent civil war , on the other , a stack of tortillas . The scale is meant to symbolize the counterbalance of the town 's history in the war with the country 's deeply rooted traditional culture of corn ' . Inside the restaurant , the walls are lined with a mix of contemporary oil paintings , centuries ' old photographs and some of the most delicious food in town . <h> Room for improvement : In-room wi-fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picky , request as so often hotels in countries like the USA and Germany rarely offer free wi-fi at all . However , for those who spend time travelling in Central America , free wi-fi is a given in almost all hotels , especially those in the budget category . Plus , La Barranca offers free-wi to guests . With a second router , the hostel would have gotten perfect marks from us , as we often work late into the night after a day of sightseeing , and would have preferred working from our room rather than out in the living room until after midnight . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143282 @2543282/ <h> Where to stay in New York City " The Nolitan Hotel <p> Plagued by jetlag the first day in New York after our summer in Berlin , I laid half awake and watched the black sky turn pink as the sun rose over the Chinese produce shop across the street from our hotel , the Nolitan . <p> Next to me , Dani was deep asleep on our cloud of a bed , cuddled up against the soft white pillows . This was just what we had both planned after our 29 hour door-to-door journey the day before , but- here I was , wasting all that comfort , laying awake and frustrated . <p> As soon as it was light enough , I hopped up and grabbed the red foam Nolitan yoga mat and spent an hour doing sunrise yoga , getting energized for our first full day back in New York . <p> The Nolitan is a boutique hotel without being precious , for better or worse . The building itself is stylish , with a mix of raw concrete ceilings and wooden floors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner on Kenmare Street in Nolita , or the area North of Little Italy . Just a five-minute walk to two subway stations , Kenmare is also the feeder street to the Williamsburg Bridge , which leads right over to the trendiest of Brooklyns neighborhoods . <p> Here in Nolita , you have a great neighborhood vibe in lower Manhattan without any of the tourist trap experience you might get with a stay in Midtown or Times Square . <h> The Room <p> The rooms have a minimalist design with an open feel and a glass shower just next to the bed . The vanity area ( sink/towels/mirror ) was also open , but The toilet was in its own very private room , with a European-style wall flush . Nolitan-branded toiletries are of excellent quality , and I jumped right into the bathrobe and slippers each night after my shower . A typical minibar with drinks is in the small fridge in the closet with the yoga mat , robes and ironing board/iron . A second box of goodies with chocolate , nuts and a lovers box was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had glasses for drinks . <p> We had a 6th floor balcony room which opened out onto Kenmare St. As the sun rose , the crescendo of sounds of the urban jungle rose with it and by 8am delivery truck doors were slamming , the occasional car was honking and a the staccato of the motorcycle mufflers as they thundered by . Any later than that in the room , and guests would be wasting their time in New York City anyway , and this urban soundtrack was n't an issue for us at all . <h> The Amenities- <p> Extras were thoughtful , if sparse , though we would have appreciated a coffeemaker in the room nor did we see coffee down in the lobby in the mornings , either . We had a folder jam-packed with restaurant menus to order in despite the onsite Cantine Parisienne restaurant , and there was no mention in the folder or from the front desk that breakfast was included and served at Cantine in the mornings . <p> The Nolitan has bicycles available for guests , free of charge , and although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved hopping on our shoddy hipster bikes and speeding across Manhattan each day during our stay . It felt great to avoid the subway , even if Dani had to do so entirely in first gear well take advantage of anything that makes us feel even more like local New Yorkers ! We also could have taken out their two skateboards , but our attempt at skateboarding just out in front of the hotel was a mess . If the bikes are already taken , The Nolitan also has two annual passes for the new citibike bike-sharing system as well . <h> Highlight The Rooftop <p> The hotel rooftop is the gem in this hotels crown . With views far and wide , standing up on the rooftop puts you right in the heart of the city . There are views all the way to the Chrysler building and the Empire State building . We stopped up at noon and could have stayed until the lights of the city began to sparkle , but alas we had to catch a flight . <h> Room for improvement Communication <p> The Nolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem was finding out about them . Missing out on a sunset up on the roof was really a shame , there was the breakfast we did n't know about , plus use of iPads and available daily passes to a nearby 24-Hour Fitness we only found out about later which would have been great with our health kick . <h> Room for improvement Weak Wi-Fi <p> A sight warning to digital nomads and business travelers , the wi-fi signal was weak in our 6th floor room , not sure if other floors had the same issue . Bring an extender if you 're looking to do internet-heavy work or any streaming . <h> The Nolitan Overall Experience- <p> With those sexy city views , a great location , its young vibe and enough extras to entertain everyone from skateboarding yogis to cycling suits , The Nolitan has the potential to offer a truly quintessential New York experience . 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 7 Comments <p> Hi there Grumpy , sorry to hear that the Nolitan is out of your budget , it was a great place to stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room rate , and in fact , $269 is an excellent rate for a New York City , especially Manhattan , hotel .

You could also try couchsurfing , too !

@@107143283 @2543283/ <h> Colombia Highlights : My 13 favorite travel moments in Colombia <p> I spent 9 weeks in Colombia , longer than I 've spent anywhere else in the past couple of years ( except for New York ) , and I would have even stayed longer , had Mexico not called my name . Looking back , I ca n't believe I almost canceled my trip " I would have missed so many amazing experiences . In short , I loved my time in Colombia . It was one of the best trips I 've taken , and while I was concerned about safety as a solo female traveler in Colombia prior to my trip , I never felt in danger . I found beautiful beaches , gorgeous Spanish-colonial towns , a vibrant nightlife in Bogota and Medellin , some of the best fruit I 've ever eaten , a spiritual awakening in the Amazon , the ruins of an ancient city in the Sierra Nevada mountains , great new friends and memories that will stay with me forever.I will tell you about most places I visited in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd start by sharing my favorite travel moments in Colombia with you : <h> 1 Chilling in the giant hammock in Minca <p> I think reading about the giant hammock was one of the things that convinced me to visit Minca , a small village in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Northern Colombia . A huge hammock with amazing mountain views ? What 's not to love ? ! The hammock , which you find a steep 3-hour walk up the mountain from Minca , belongs to the Casa Elemento hostel and was well worth the long walk for a relaxing afternoon . But everything else I did in Minca was memorable , as well : we toured a coffee finca , visited and swam in the waterfalls around town and sampled local artisan beers . <h> 2 Trekking to the Lost City <p> I had been fascinated by this trek to the ruins of a pre-Columbian ancient city high up in the Sierra Nevada Mountains ever since I had first heard about it a few years ago , but I was n't sure if I was able to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It turned out I was able to finish it , and the four days of trekking turned out to be some of my best days in Colombia . The walk through the beautiful mountain scenery , through the jungle , across rivers , passing indigenous villages , and finally climbing up 1,200 stairs , was worth every painful step , and the ruins of the Lost City itself were more remarkable than I thought they 'd be . I was lucky enough to have a great group of fellow trekkers whose company made me get through the hard parts of the hike " lots of steep mountain trails , which nearly killed me. <h> 3 Tubing in Palomino <p> I went to Palomino for the beach , but ended up enjoying the river that runs from the Sierra Nevada Mountains , which hug the coastline here , much more than the ocean ! In Palomino , the waves are so high that it is nearly impossible to go for a swim , but luckily the little beach town has a river that is slowly flowing from the mountains into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubing . My friend and I went for a late afternoon tubing tour and I loved floating on the river , surrounded by lush green jungle , listening to the birds and watching the Golden Hour covering everything in a beautiful golden light . <h> 4 A street art tour in Bogota <p> I mentioned before that I was surprised by Bogota " in a good way ! I expected to dislike the city , because many travelers rush through here , unimpressed by Colombia 's capital . I , however , ended up spending more time here than expected , and got to know the city better than most travelers who only spend a couple of nights here . My favorite thing about Bogota ? The sprawling street art scene ! No matter where in Bogota you are , there is street arteverywhere . I spent most of my time in the historic La Candelaria neighborhood , which is probably the neighborhood with the most street art in the city . Obviously , I was in street art heaven and could n't put my camera down . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an awesome graffiti was learning about Bogota 's graffiti and street art scene during a free street art walk through La Candelaria . If you love street art and find yourself in Bogota , I highly recommend taking this tour . <h> 5 The sunsets in Cartagena <p> Cartagena definitely wins the prize for the best sunsets I saw in Colombia ! No matter if from the thick stone walls that surround the Old City or from the sandy beaches of Bocagrande , the new part of town , every sunset was spectacular . But not only the sunsets were lovely " Cartagena itself was a picture-perfect town , easily the prettiest town I visited in Colombia , and I took nearly 1,000 photos of its brightly colored Spanish-colonial houses , flower-filled wooden balconies and eye-catching door knockers . I extended my stay in Cartagena twice because I could n't pull myself away from this gorgeous city ! <h> 6 Kayaking in the Amazon <p> I spent eight days in the Amazon " a last-minute addition to my itinerary , and I am glad I spent the extra cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way to get there is to fly in ) . While I found the lack of wildlife encounters a bit disappointing , I found the Amazon River and life along the Amazon fascinating " and a kayaking trip that brought me up close with the gianttrees of the Amazon was an experience I wo n't forget anytime soon . <h> 7 Feasting on fresh fruit everywhere <p> Colombia 's wide range of exotic fruit is incredible " there are so many fruits in this country that I had never even heard of . My mission was to try them all ! And I did a good job , with daily fruit salads from street vendors in Cartagena , or a thick slice of pineapple to start my day with in Santa Marta ( for about $0.30 ! ) . In the Amazon , I got to taste local fruits like Cupuacu , anona , aguaje , granadilla , uvilla or tumbo all fruits which can be found only there , and are n't  exported . But even fruit I already knew , like mango , zapote , pineapple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in other places . The fruits were one of my favorite things about Colombia . <h> 8 Hiking through the Valle de Cocora <p> The Valle de Cocora near Salento , right in the heart of Colombia 's coffee region , is one of the most fascinating places I 've ever been to : green mountainsides filled with these tall , up to 60 meter high wax palm trees which tower high above cattle farms . The hike I did was beautiful , and being a 4-hour round trip , it was a good workout at the same time . <h> 9 Visiting coffee plantations in Quindio and Magdalena <p> Coffee is probably my biggest vice , and so it was a given that I 'd visit Colombia 's coffee region to see where some of the world 's best coffee is from . I had toured a coffee finca a few years ago in Guatemala , and even though I knew the process would be pretty much the same , I was happy to see again how the bean makes its way from the farm into my cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting a coffee plantation in the zona cafeteria , but also in the Sierra Nevada Mountains , a lesser known and considerably smaller coffee producing region in Colombia . The old-fashioned family-run coffee plantation I visited there , Finca La Victoria , including a tasting of a freshly brewed cup , was a highlight of the trip for this coffee lover . <h> 10 Stepping back in time in Villa De Leyva <p> It took me only about one minute to fall in love with Villa De Leyva , which is often called the most beautiful colonial village in Colombia , and I am nodding my head in approval " I do n't think there 's a place prettier than Villa de Leyva with its whitewashed houses , cobble stone streets and its vast town square , flanked by bright white houses on all sides , and with a Spanish-colonial church that dates back to 1608 . Wandering the streets of the village I could n't help but think : this place has n't changed at all since it was founded in 1572 ! Okay , there might be cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , I really do n't think it has changed much over the past 500 years . <h> 11 Beach day in Playa Blanca <p> I love going to the beach , and I went to quite a few beaches in Colombia , all along the Caribbean Coast . My favorite beach day ? Playa Blanca near Cartagena ! Cartagena is hot and humid year round , but luckily there are a few places where you can take a break from the heat for a while . Playa Blanca on Baru Island is one such place , an easy 45-minute bus ride away . Playa Blanca means White Beach , and that 's exactly what it is : a white sand beach with clear turquoise waters which is so pretty that I ended up spending most of the day staring out at the ocean instead of reading my book . <h> 12 Seeing Botero 's art in Medellin and Bogota <p> Fernando Botero is one of Colombia 's most famous artists and I love his fat people ' paintings and sculptures . I 've seen his sculptures of voluminous women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , New York , Mexico and Singapore , and now I was finally in his home country excited to see more of his art here , and find out more about the artist . I cant help but smile when I look at his fat people sculptures and paintings his signature style and seeing more of his art around Colombia was wonderful . I loved the Botero Museum in Bogota , but Medellins Museum of Antioquia and the Parque de Las Esculturas , right outside the museum , were my absolute favorite places to learn more about Botero and more of his art . <h> 13 Salsa nights in Bogota <p> I did n't make it to Cali , where most female travelers seem to end up to learn how to salsa , but I would have loved to learn salsa steps . However , I ran out of time . What I did have time for though ? To visit quite a few excellent salsa bars , in which I danced several nights away ( without exactly knowing how to salsa , but I had fun nonetheless ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all places that I found such great salsa bars , but I had a super guide who introduced me to Bogota 's nightlife and made the city much more fun for me than I thought it 'd be , as I mentioned above . One salsa highlight was the salsa bar inside El Theatron , which the biggest gay &amp; lesbian night club in all of South America.For more Colombia photos , check out my Facebook photo album here . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Were spending just under a month in Colombia- hope to tick as many as we can off this list .

I just recently found your blog and I am so excited to read more ! Beautiful photos and recap of Colombia its a country that is really high on my list , and I 'm glad to hear that you had such a positive experience there . Great post ! = <p> Theres soooo much to see I spent two weeks on the Caribbean coast alone and that was only east of Cartagena there were several places west of Cartagena that sounded amazing , too , but I just did n't  have the time and then there 's the Pacific Coast and so much more in the center of the country that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the places around Medellin that people kept telling me about that sounded amazing .. aaah , the list is endless ! ! <p> Love , love , loooove the idea of a kayaking tour on the Amazon ! I 've done a lot of half day kayaking trips in the last year and they 're such a great way to see the area , especially in those types of remote places . <p> OH MY GOD . THAT HAMMOCK . I wo n't lie , Columbia was n't on my top listen of countries to visit on my trip to South America ( at the moment , I think I 'm only going to have 4 months off work total ) but your posts have really made me rethink that decision ! <p> Hi Rachel , the perfect time for Colombia is actually December to April . I know that the summer months ( esp July September ) can be pretty rainy . That does n't  mean itll rain all day , but therell be rainy afternoons and its overall cloudier . I know that the trek to the Lost City and Tayrona National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in August and said she had to escape the pressing humidity along the coast . So I do n't  know how I feel about July , but Lonely Planet has always good information on Best time to visit ( I usually look through their free samples on Amazon which has the first chapters of the book ) 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

And I happened to visit one such place this month . A place I never even thought I 'd visit : Dallas . In my head , Dallas was a big , personality-lacking , dull , corporate kind-of-city . <p> Instead , I found a city filled with interesting attractions , a fantastic restaurant scene , great bars , street art ( even more than in much more alternative Austin ! ) . <p> To be honest , I did n't  even plan to visit any other Texan cities while I was in Austin , but as so often , the opportunity to go up there for the weekend arose suddenly , and I jumped on it , because ..

Apparently , it had been cold and rainy most of the spring until the weekend of my arrival and hearing this made me feel reassured again about having spent all of May in Austin ( in case you have n't noticed yet Ive got a major case of FOMO and scarifying a month in New York for four weeks in Austin was n't an easy decision for me to make ! ) . To be honest , I was considering extending my stay in Austin for another three weeks ( yes , I loved it that much more on that to come next week ) but then my travel plans were changed by circumstances beyond my control ( more on that soon ) . <p> And that 's why I ended up spending only eight days in my adopted home .

@@107143289 @2543289/ <h> What I Wonder When I Wander : How can I Get Healthy on the Road ? <p> First off , I 'd like you to notice what the title of this weeks column is not . I do n't wonder how I can stay healthy on the road " at least not yet . I have to get there first . <p> Before Dani and I left to travel , I was definitely not at my healthiest point in life . In fact , saying it that way is just being polite to myself . I was a wreck , physically and emotionally . Not only did Dani and I have terrible eating habits , but I was also constantly stressing out and not handling challenges well . I can see now that this had as much to do with my poor diet and lack of exercise as it did with my dissatisfaction of office life . <p> Cutting all ties with anyone else 's expectations ( becoming a nomad ) was an amazing way for both of us to stick up our middle fingers at the status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I was 19 , but actually becoming homeless has made me the happiest yet . It did wonders for my mental health . There was a sense of calm in the freedom . A slow but steady confidence pushed up through the cracks of the conventional lifestyle I was slowly shedding . Having just recently hit 800 days traveling last week , it is obvious that this lifestyle really suits us both . <p> For the first time in a long time , I want to be healthy physically as well . Not just to lose weight , although I have gone up two sizes since we set off. - I want to get into great shape , rock a bikini while I 'm still young enough . I do n't  need a six-pack but I want to be able to do 100 push-ups , use a playground as a place to do pull-ups , run miles through new cities . I want to know just how good I can feel , physically . <p> Sampling local specialties in Italy <p> The Nomadic Nutrition Conundrum- <p> Being nomadic is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I saw it that way at first road-side diners and fast food in the States , lots of oily beans and rice dishes in Latin America , cheese and bread in Europe . Each country has a specialty or two , and I can safely tell you , some 30 countries later , that , though delicious , these dishes almost always fall under the category of comfort food . <p> We are both total foodies and really enjoy sampling these foods it is also nearly impossible for me to say no ' when Dani also gets to work sampling the national pastry or dessert as well . Unlike me , Dani is one of those lucky ladies who can eat whatever she wants and not gain weight . She feels unaffected by her food and was born with a bottomless energy tank . It is hard not to fall into that seductive traphow much easier it would be to just enjoy the food we find around the world and not worry about it at all like Dani- On the one hand , I see this as a self-control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fried foods and not eat those sweets . But that solves only one half of the problem . <p> One of the rare occasions that Dani joined me for a work out Runyon Canyon , L.A. <p> If I do n't eat the rice , the bread , the cheese ( though I am pretty sure this one is impossible ) I have trouble finding the healthy alternative . Not being from a place makes it a lot harder to find those healthy restaurants , and although we always try , much of the time the attempts are futile . Do n't forget Dani and I are vegetarians and have been for a combined total of 51 years ( me , my whole life , Dani since she was 12 years old ) . More than anything I would love to dig in to a big salad for at least one meal a day , but anyone who has traveled in developing countries can understand the , let 's say , explosive risk involved in ordering a salad . <p> Unexpectedly , Cambodia turned out to have some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ordered salad in Guatemala or ate that lovely sliced fresh fruit on the side of the road in El Salvador , we risked the revenge known as Montezuma in a serious way . The two of us have had just about every travel sickness there is . This means that when traveling in developing nations , we eat fresh food primarily at restaurants aimed at foreigners , cleaned with filtered water . These places are harder to find and not always available , which puts me back at square one " eating local foods that I enjoy without being able to control my diet . <p> Sampling local specialties in Nicaragua : Platanos , Rice &amp; Beans , Yucca , Cheese , Eggs and Potatoes.Note : Everything on this plate is fried . <p> Getting fit on the road is Insanity ! - <p> Nutrition conundrum aside , burning calories is obviously the best way for me to get fit " and in January of this year I started to get serious about working out again .

I was working out in 100 degree South East Asian heat on dirty guesthouse floors " I wanted it that bad ! I got myself a yoga mat and took up that practice to balance the intense workouts . <p> I also started learning about health from my two favorite wellness podcasts " Jillian Michaels and Sean Croxton of Underground Wellness . We were in Thailand at this time , and I was able to afford full blood work , got a series of B-12 shots and leveled out my iron and magnesium. - We started taking a multivitamin everyday on top of it and by the time we got to Cambodia I was rocking , shedding weight and feeling the best I had felt in years . <p> There should be more beaches that come with work-out equipment like this one in Venice Beach , California <p> Injury and lack of motivation- <p> Fast forward to April in Singapore when I aggravated a knee injury and then on to May in India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all places where I was looking forward to yoga every day and had even toyed with the idea of hitting up an ashram . For sarcastic old me , that was as far as I had ever thought to go , spiritually . But first my knee held me back and then , of course , I was rammed by that cow . <p> Another encounter with a cow luckily , this time no-one got hurt.Denver , Colorado <p> Laid completely flat for over two weeks and stuck with the few restaurants in the beach town we were in that would let Dani take food away , I gained back everything I had lost and more. - This shook my confidence and robbed me of my motivation . The longer I could n't exercise , the less I felt like it anyway . <p> Our housesit in Tucson saved me . There I could go on short walks with the dog and swim in the pool to help my body recover , and was able to shop at Trader Joe 's and prepare healthy food for a month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strawberry and spinach salads for lunch . Now we are in Mexico on a two-month housesit at the beach house .

Stability is the best way to control a food and exercise regimen . 2 . Being a nomad is inherently unstable . 3 . I want to be physically fit and eat right . 4 . I have never been happier than when being a nomad . <p> The two things I want most do n't seem to line up . <p> Here 's what I wonderHow do I get fit on the road ? Its been over two years now and the ups and downs are really bugging me . I know that I probably wo n't be attacked by normally docile livestock again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even mention that up there ) , but how do I manage to find the balance between nomadic life and kick-ass physical condition . If I could do that , I think I would be entirely at peace <h> 69 Comments <p> I struggle with the same thing and may be starting to run because its the only thing that will guarantee that I exercise when I travel . <p> I was just at WDS and met Nathan Agin who is really big on staying fit while traveling . He made the 16 people in our dorm room green smoothies each morning so we 'd start the day off right . Really inspiring , check out his site here http : **28;785;TOOLONG <p> Running is definitely a great option , but I find that that is only good for Europe or the US/Canada . I feel like in Honduras or Cambodia it just feels too funny for me in my running shoes and bottle of water to go running when people are so physically active in their real lives . As for me , with the knee , running sems ot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My knee was fine when doing Insanity and then one run on the treadmill in Singapore and my slow but steady decline happened ! Ill definitely check out Nathans site cant wait to read it , really . I need motivation and also some serious tips about it all so thanks so much for that ! <p> I hear you ! I think the most important thing is exercise , and making it fun so you want to do it . I love running , and its a great way to get an early morning view of a new place . For those times when that seems too much of a chore , I usually skip , and it barely feels like effort ! <p> That 's the thing , Lindsey . A lot of it is the workout but between yoga and Insanity I felel find with that . Its the food aspect what they say is about 80% of your success that I find so challenging . I feel like I cant control my diet because I am limited to restaurants and stores that sell Cheetos = <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a new lifestyle as a great opportunity to get fit . I managed to lose 26kg , mostly due to just changing my diet ( moving to a mostly vegetarian option even though I 'm not ) , and also because I started walking an amazing amount . <p> It took me around eight months to lose that amount , and Ive since been stable ( nearly three years now ) , and try to keep up with the activity too . I hate the idea of " exercise " it has to be doing something I enjoy like going for a long walk on the beach or up a mountain . I 'm also terrible with food if its around I 'll eat anything . So best to not have much to hand I 've found .. Hope you achieve what you want ! <p> Hi Laurence I know that a lot of travelers ( usually men ) tend to she 'd a bunch of weight just from the increased walking and improved diet . But we walk constantly around every city ( but just as much as we did in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from putting on even more weight , it has n't  been enough for me to lose any .

After having a baby in 2010 , I still havent recovered my pre-baby figure . I lose almost all the weight through cutting carbs , Zumba and hot yoga . I do really well when were at home and then we go and travel and it comes right back . Ive lost ( and gained ) the same 8kgs probably three times over the last 18 months . <p> I really just cant help myself when were travelling . Were not permanent nomads but we still travel for at least half the year , a few months at a time . We love food too . America shocked us . We ate like pigs for three months burgers , fries , pulled pork sandwiches . I just couldnt get enough of anything greasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SE Asia and I do n't  think I put on weight , thanks to the heat , but I certainly did n't  lose any . I bought from Zumba DVDs but I find it a bit embarrassing doing it in front of my husband ! ! <p> Were at home for a decent stretch of time now at least five months so I 'm going to attack the fat and hopefully get it all off finally . <p> I 'm on board with the whole green smoothie idea . Spirulina powder , a vegan super green protein powder and a bit of fruit makes a killer breakfast . Maybe you could order some online and get it sent to Mexico ? <p> If I could nip the carbs in the butt I 'm sure it would really help me , they 're just too damn delicious . <p> Bethaney , I feel your pain , too I actuall make Dani leave the room wherever we are while I work out . I am embarrassed , especially with Insanity where I am huffing and puffing like crazy ! Shes cool with it thoughand it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! As for anything in a blender , that 's out for now . our house here in Mexico is on solar power and we do n't  even have a coffee potbut have bought a lot of frozen spinach to incorporate into mealsbtw I tried Zumba , but its definitely NOT for me = Keep us updated wed love to hear how you get along knocking the weight off in the next few months . I hope to have some sweet after pictures at some point later this year ! = <p> I do n't  think you are the only one ! Months of hard work in the gym while we have stability works then BOOM goodbye waistline when we hit the road . Adela has the motivation to run sometimes during the mornings and try room workouts . I spend my time in front of the computer while she sweats away though . Not good ! <p> Hey Cole even though I wish everyone the best , its nice to hear that other people share my misery = Its hard because I want to stay motivated and I was TOTALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 hour bus ride , its hard to want to work out , but I know I should because I probably ate a white bread roll , plantain chips and a donut or something to get through the rideGood on Adela to go running and working out . Hopefully her and I can motivate you and Dani more often : ) <p> Great post , and fitness is definitely one of the biggest issues Ive faced in my short nomadic life so far . <p> As you alluded to , routine is the most important part of an exercise regime and the lack of routine is why were living this lifestyle ! I 'd enjoy biking or lifting weights every day , but that 's just not possible a lot of the time . <p> I do n't  particularly like running , but its the one type of exercise that you can do anywhere . Because I do n't  enjoy it for its own sake , I vary my route each day to explore new things . And its a nice bit of consistency in an otherwise routine-free life : wherever we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing in the morning while the streets are still empty . <p> Finally , wow : Insanity on guesthouse floors must take serious motivation ! I love Insanity , but I 'm too easily embarrassed to do it unless I have a lot of privacyI do n't  want to have an audience for my Heismans ! <p> I do n't  see how getting fit would be much of a problem . When you are traveling , you are always on the go , which burns a lot of calories . The best suggestion that I can make is to cut out beer from your diet , although traveling and sampling local beers is so much fun . <p> That is a bloody good question . I 'm sitting here in Salta wondering the very same thing . Before we stopped here , I was full of great intentions . I thought " yes , well be able to cook great food and do yoga every day , maybe even use the gym . " Three weeks later and Ive done yoga once ! The problem was I got ill almost immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return . Steve was also i 'll then he burnt his leg on the sauna and could n't walk well , so combined we werent that up for cooking or able to exercise . So much for the good plans . We have about two weeks left now to try and redeem our good intentions before heading to Bolivia . Aside from the obvious pitfalls of illness and lack of nutritional food , I think my real hurdle is discipline . Even at home , I find keeping fit and healthy quite hard . That is until I get into the habit of it . Once I feel healthy , I get hooked on it , but as soon as I break the habit ( maybe due to illness ) I find it so difficult to get back into it . Travelling presents lots of opportunities for the habit to be broken so I guess therein lies the problem . <p> Victoria just reading this makes me feel immediately as though I am not alone in this ! This is exactly what we do ( well , by we I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a question of disciplinemaybe we need to form a group and hold each other accountable ? Or maybe we would just eat ice cream on Google Hangouts together = <p> I know you know from reading my recent diabetes post that I TOTALLY feel you on this one . But , interestingly enough , I almost always lose weight when we travel because Mary and I always stay super busy on the road . One of the down sides of NOT being permanent nomads is that we have to rush like hell to see/do everything possible in a week or 10 days . The upside of that is we are very active , hiking , swimming , kayaking , ziplining or whatever . And the extra benefit of that is that , when were traveling , we can eat pretty much whatever we want ( though we still tend to make somewhat healthy choices ) . So I guess my advice would be to stay active , do everything in moderation , and whatever you do do NOT try to go cold turkey on your favorite things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . <p> What totally annoys me , though , Bret is that we are super active all the time . We swim and hike and walk MILES across cities in the heatbut that just does n't  work for me . You , by the way , are looking GREAT and I wanted to congratulate you on your success ! You prove that it really is all about discipline . <p> I have n't found my way to stay healthy on the road yet , I am quite new as a full time travel .. I know though that soon I have to think about it and do something too ! I generally have an healthy diet but , as you probably know better than me , while travelling its not always easy to choose what is only healthy . I think you should really try the best compromise for you , the one that makes you feel good with your body and your mind ! = <p> Hey Franca good luck with the healthy eating on the road ! I think if you put your mind to it , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptation or be so starving at some points that you just eat whatever ! <p> I completely empathise with the problems of eating healthily as a vegetarian on the road ( warning : South America is not great for that , except Buenos Aires ) and having a skinny partner who constantly tempts you ! <p> I miss having a pool in Thailand as it was exercise I actually enjoyed . I feel too self conscious to go running in cities . We are definitely eating more unhealthily in Europe . Italy was so full of temptation , but I do n't  really feel like denying myself as food is a big reason why we travel . <p> Erin , I do believe you know exactly what I go through because I have watched Simon and Dani together piling through chocolate cake : ) But you said it better than I did food is really one of the major reasons why we travel . Howevermiss Erin , you look great and have no weight to gain or lose at all ! <p> First of all , congratulations on 800+ days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you regarding the health pros and cons of long term travel . I have n't resorted to workouts on a dirty floor ( yet ) but its in the cards . Good thing most cheap rooms do n't  have full-length mirrors ! <p> Karen you know what you are so right about cheap rooms and full length mirrors . I usually get much more body image conscious when we stay at some of our nicer hotels along the way due in large part to all the mirrors ! = <p> Oh I so hear you . I had exactly the same problem when I moved to Cambodia . I put on 5kg in three months , because my body was craving more food due to the hot weather ( salt deprivation ) , I could n't do exercise because of the hot weather and because I ate out all the time . I am back to my old weight now , because I started eating normally again and do gentle weather friendly exercise , such as swimming , or sit ups under my aircon unit . Do n't  think I could ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . : -/ <p> Tammy really interesting that you gained weight specifically in Cambodia . See , for me , Cambodia was a place where I was able to find great salads on menus throughout the country and actually lost weight there . That is where I was rocking my insanity the hardest ! ! <p> I found it tough to stay healthy on the road too . You want to try all the local specialities and when I 'm in a place for a short amount of time I want to make the most out of everything . It must be tough being a veggie too because it can become a bit of a carb fest at every meal . I remember craving a salad so badly in Asia . <p> In the end I gave up trying to eat super healthily and concentrated on exercising . I stayed in Thailand for a couple of months to scuba dive and do yoga and this gave me a kick start to begin running and hiking too . Plus , carrying a heavy backpack everywhere is great exercise ! <p> Monica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually craving a salad . I think you 're right about the fact that you want to make the most of everything and try so much of the food and then before you know it you 've eaten like crap for a seven days in a rowthe Yoga is a big one for me as it just makes me aware of my body without being all sore , and gives me energy <p> 800 days on the road amazing and keeping healthy along the way is a great challenge , guess even after so long on the road there are still some challenges . Healthy food and habits are difficult to find , I wish you luck with finding them both . Thansk for sharing your thoughts . <p> Wow , this is so incredibly relevant to me , and I 'm really grateful you started this discussion . Alex from alexinwanderland.com directed me here , and I 'm sooooooo glad she did . I am currently at 3.5 months traveling and recently had to buy some new jeans . The first shop I stopped in in Bulgaria did n't  have any my size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Once I got my hands on a scale I realized I 've gained 10lbs since I left home . And , like you said , its crazywe are walking EVERYWHERE with heavy backpacks on . Its not as if we are not active . It is very frustrating ! Some Peace Corps. volunteers I talked to said that it is normal for men to lose weight and women to gain it during their time abroad because of the different ways our bodies handle stress . This , and your post , helped me realize I 'm not abnormal , but it still does n't  solve the problem . Ive been in one place for two weeks now and have gotten a good diet and exercise routine down , and have lost a couple pounds in the process . But what 's going to happen when I leave here ? What am I going to do about that next 10 hour bus ride ? I really do n't  want to sacrifice my health/self-image for my nomadic lifestyle , but I also really do n't  want to stop traveling <p> Hey Lauren thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention the fact that buying new clothes , bigger clothes , in places like Asia , Latin America or apparently Bulgaria , is also really hard since the sizes are so much smaller there to begin with . Ugh ! I completely understand the conflict between traveling and being healthy and can only encourage you by saying that its easier in some countries for sure . In South East Asia I found that I could eat more salads , and in Europe I was able to eat better when I actually tried . If you look at Ayngelinas comment on this post , you 'll find the link to a blogger who writes at Non Stop Awesomeness http : **32;815;TOOLONG he is super healthy and very inspiring ! <p> I lost 50 pounds while I was living in Bulgaria for 2.5 years.its all salads and yogurts and fish and The Mediterranean Diet , basically .

I have an extendable pullup bar and resistance bandsand both fit into my 35L backpack and can go with me no matter where I go . <p> The hardest part about getting healthy is just making the decision to start being that way and controlling your diet . And I still have cheat days where I 'll go out and buy like 2 or 3 gansitos/choco-rolles and gorge myself with a mochabut they are rare and far between = Its all about routineonce you establish it , it become second nature . <p> This is an awesome comment , T.W. basically because you 're telling me exactly what I already know but just do n't  do , and proving that it works . I know that its all about making the decision to commit to eating only whole foods . I know that . It just needs to done . Congratulations on kicking ass , losing all that weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathartic for me and I feel like I have to ramp up my attempts at self-control a bit more to make this happen . Your comment has definitely played a role in me doing that ! <p> After doing yoga the other day , I then ate a super healthy salad . I was doing so well that I then went out and rewarded myself with an ice cream ! I 'm definitely not sure I 'm the right person to be enforcing discipline " I 'm full of excellent excuses for why now is not the time for exercise , but most definitely the time for cake ! That said , I have been doing more yoga so thanks for kick starting that = <p> Well , you may remember my post about gaining weight abroad = And actually on the day you posted this I had a reader email me and ask for an update on that post . I sent her this one ! <p> I lost the weight I had gained completely but it was the easiest/hardest way . via an emotional trauma . However , when I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping ( first in a lifetime ! ) I realized I wanted to stay at this healthier weight . I 've kept it off so far but at the moment I 'm 50% travel 50% home so I 'll be curious what happens when I 'm back to 100% travel . <p> Hi Alex thanks for sending Lauren over = Losing weight with trauma works , but its like smoking to lose weight ultimately its crap for your health . Congrats for keeping it all off and let us all know what happens when you 're back on the road 100% of the time ! <p> I think this is one of the hardest things to deal with when you 're on the road all the time . I find the lack of routine and the general fatigue of always moving too much to cope with and exercise loses its place on the priority list . Having said that , a decent diet , cutting down on the booze ( prob my biggest problem ) and walking a couple of hours every day would be a pretty good start , I imagine . <p> That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve optimal anything . You put it really well , though its the lack of routine and the general fatigue of always moving that makes it so hard , and hard for me to stick to my guns and just say no to junk food . <p> I think this is HUGE struggle for so many travelers . Food is such an important part of the experience but if you are nomadic , you do n't  get a lot of detox time . I would suggest taking more " break trips " like the italy one you mentioned . Allow yourself time to slow down , prepare healthy meals at home while doing intense workouts and detoxing . <p> My brother is a personal trainer and I often work with him to design travel friendly workouts . I 'd be happy to share some with you , just send me an email ! <p> Hey Rease , I will definitely send you an email ! ! That 's great , and you are right taking breaks is really important to stay on track . The first two years we traveled quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this beach house is too far from anything to even pop into a shop ) so for a while I 'll get a routine back into my life <p> This has to be incredibly tough . I know people that travel all the time for work gain a lot of weight . You just do n't  have the same healthy eating options when traveling like you do at home . <p> Ironically , I have the opposite problem . I gain weight at home and lose on the road because I cam constantly on the go and walk everywhere . For me , I do n't  care that much about food when I travel so I tend to push hard and go long stretches without caring about food . <p> Hopefully you will be able to find a good balance for traveling , eating , and exercising and find the right fit for you . Good luck and do n't  give up ! <p> Thanks Jeremy ! Your story about losing weight on the road is really common for guys , I think . We walk , and walk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midsection ! = I 'm not ready to give up traveling yet , so its the food/workouts department that is going to have to step it up ! <p> Hey Jess , I read all of you and Danis entries , but rarely comment . And this is going to sound a little whoo-whoo , so I 'm just speaking for myself . <p> Ive been reading your blog for a long time and it seems to me that you eat a healthy diet . My nutritionist recently told me that shed rather I eat extra food like sweets and exceed my daily calorie recommendation than eat less calories thereby sacrificing nutrients and vitamins . She said , " Think of all the healthy nutrients and vitamins you 're " supposed " to get in a day . And then think about how much food you would have to eat to actually get all those nutrients and vitamins . she is not a proponent of supplements or vitamins Youll never have THE perfect diet , so just know what you 're supposed to eat , try to eat some of that every day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you can . " Good stuff . <p> Anyway , you are very active ( except for when you were injured , which was your body telling you to SLOW DOWN ) and you eat healthy ( plus sugar ) so maybe the problem is psychological . Maybe the key is just embracing your weight/size/body for what it is . <p> America teaches women to hate our bodies from the moment were old enough to watch TV or look at a magazine . If you have a loving partner , exercise and get nutrients and vitamins your body needs to thrive , maybe your weight/size shouldnt matter so much ? In an ideal world , right ? ! <p> Hey Camella first of all thanks for commenting = I really appreciate your comment so much I think its really supportive and you 're right . I do n't  have a perfect body and I let it get to me , for sure . It does n't  help that my girlfriend is a size 6 , an 8 if she has gained a bit ( which almost never happens anyway ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more if that means you get more nutrients than eat less to lose weight but deplete the body of the right kind of fuel . I think that I did n't  want the post to be even more of a pity party of one , but I have actually had some health issues which get me down sometimes . After I had Dengue ( late 2010 ) my immune system was down I had a ( wheezing ) cough for over two months through Costa Rica and Panama , a few bigger skin issues that went away once I started eating really well in Cambodia , and my joints were achy to the point that if I leaned on my wrists or knees for more than just a few minutes , I felt almost painfully frozen or stuck in place . Ive since learned that the last thing was related to inflammation which happens when the body is out of balance ( could be gluten issue or unbalanced Omega 3/6 levels ) , and I still do n't  know what that cough or skin issues were about . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get down on myself for not having a six-pack , I actually felt the early signs of actual health deterioration due almost entirely to a poor travel diet . Does that make sense ? This might be too much information , though : ) Ever since I got the B-12 shots , started taking Magnesium and doing yoga/Insanity my health has been much better ! ! <p> Thanks for the reply ! Obviously , there are a lot of health problems complicating matters . Health problems can hold ANYONE back from achieving their desired fitness level . <p> It seems to me like you absolutely know what you need to do and what you need to eat to feel your best , the hard part is just figuring out how to make it work with your travel lifestyle . i wish you the best of luck in feeling your best ! = <p> I have noticed that in the photos you post here over the past month or two that you have sort of been hiding behind Dani . So embrace yourself in a hug and do whatever it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touchy-feelyIm really a sarcastic , opinionated wench , but feel passionately about body image stuff . As a lesbian woman myself , not having to uphold myself to male beauty standards has actually been pretty free-ing. = <p> Oh , and I really love this new series . Your water bottle post was awesome ! Something I thought about a lot during my four months in Guatemala . <p> Thanks Camella , so glad you 're liking these posts ! Two quick things I actually found nerd fitness through this awesome video of him working out around the world that was inspiring for sure ! Second how astute of you to notice my particular posing position in our pics ! I wonder how many other people notice . I really try to hidehow awful ! But hopefully one day these will all be my before pics anyway : ) Ive been doing yoga again massively and going to start working out again in a couple of weeks time when I feel that my knee is back to normal , or almost . Thanks so much for such supportive words . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put yourself out there that people respond with positivity , no matter how touchy feely it happens to be = <p> Hi Camella , realize I never replied to this i will definitely check out nerd fitness . Thanks for the touchy-feely sentiments , you totally caught me that I have hidden behind Dani on a few occasions . Ca n't believe you paid that much attention = <p> LOVE this article . Because feeling healthy is more than a size , or a weight its being able to eat well , and move . My husband walks a LOT for fitness , but when its hot and humid , that goes out the door . I swim for fitness , but when we are n't  on our lake or by a lake , that goes out , too . We eat well , but traveling and eating well is very difficult . It helps that we rent houses when we travel . but Youve outlined the hard parts ! We all live them , and just try our best . The other thing I totally recommend is getting enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hey Jessie , thanks for commenting . You bring up a good point I like swimming and we almost never have a pool , and I really started to love running and then my knee completely went out . When you 're on the road , beggars ca n't be choosers and that 's hard especially when its 100 degrees and humid outsideIts all about really trying our best , I think . In spite of all the challenges , that is ! <p> OMG that food all looks incredible ! I find it really hard to eat healthily on the road as I have a big sweet tooth and a bit of missing out on delicious food anxiety . But as these pictures show , sometimes the healthy food is the best food ! YUM <p> Someone else mentioned green smoothies and I could not agree more . Nothing stabilises me more than a green smoothie in the morning . It sets me off to a good start and inspires me to make better choices during the day . Its not always possible but if you can get your hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination you are all set . I follow this up with yoga and then see my new destination by bike or walking . it is a constant challenge though . When i first started travelling I put on 12kg so I sympathise with you . <p> Very interesting Kirra ! What do you put in the green smoothie ? I like what you say about picking up a blender , maybe the next time we stay somewhere for a bit longer , I 'll do that . I am doing yoga and I absolutely love it , and as soon as injuries heal I 'll do Insanity again ! <p> Excellent post . My partner and I have been traveling since April 2012 ( we came across your blog in Guatemala and it seems you guys have always just been , or are going to , the same places as us ) . Its fair to say my metabolism sounds similar to Danis , but my partner has the same concerns you do . Funnily enough , Shaun T has become our personal fitness guru alsowe got through 6 weeks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . But the fact that you can do a class here and there ( even if not following the program ) is a real plus . Another suggestion is to find a local gym class . Generally I hate gym classes but we went to a Les Mills bodypump class in Mexico which was not only bearable but fun 1 ) because it was in Spanish and 2 ) because its a great way to see people just doing the same everyday things no matter where you are in the globe . Yoga and spin classes seem to be pretty globally available too . The other thing of course is taking control of your own diet by staying in places with a kitchen , clearly you 're doing this anyway , but it made all the difference for us , plus shopping in local markets and seeing all the crazy supermarket products is one of our absolute favorite things to do in a new place ! Good luck finding a health regime that works for you . Hope you get fit enough doing insanity that you could wipe that overenthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks so much for your comment it feels really good to hear how other people struggle and identify with this issue . I am back up and running now and working out again , Insanity starts again in a week or so . And by the way Tania she is the one with the abs in the red sports bra , right ? I want her abs for real ! Dani and I used to do bodypump classes in London twice a week and we both LOVED it . It was amazing how much stronger we were after a few weeks than in the beginning . Our problem with gyms is that it can be really costly always paying the day rate . In Kuala Lumpur , for example , they wanted $30 , in Singapore it was even more , New York was $35 , etc . When we can we try to get a hotel with a gym , but that only happens in the developed world . Groupon is great for finding cheap workouts , as well , especially yoga and pilates . You guys should stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next maybe we can meet up somewhere in the world ! <p> Thanks for the groupon tip . Yep that 's Tania all right . I love it how everyone in the videos are the LEAST in need of an insane cardio workout . But i digress . My partner and I have actually been traveling since April 2011 ( typo ) and are just about to put down some temporary roots in Bristol , UK to work and keep traveling around in our spare time from there . We are actually Aussies , so nearly anywhere in the world is a muchheaper and closer place to travel from than our hometown Melbourne . With that , any future posts , reflections , etc on your time traveling , working or living in the UK would be more than welcome ! And of course if you find yourself in exotic Bristolor Australia even , give us a holler . <p> We lived in the UK for four years , Sandra , and I actually worked for the tourist board there , so can definitely help out with tips ( we left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . We probably wont be in Bristol any time soon , but sooner than Australia I should think . We lived in Brighton , Durham and then London for three years , so let us know whatever questions you have ! = have fun in Bristol ! <p> You would never say so if you looked at me or my photos , but I do have the same problem . I can not gain more than 5 kilos , that 's the fact , but I still need to watch what I do and eat . And each time I visit home , I almost do n't  do any physical movement , but eat , so it is visible on me just after a week at home . Struggle ! <p> Jess , I commented here about a month ago when you first posted this blog . I just wanted to give you an update . Ive been traveling for about 4 1/2 months , and around month 3 realized that gaining a pound a week was something I would have to stop if I was going to continue traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever it is possible , probably 4 out of 7 days a week . I 'm also doing some crunches on the side . I cut out beer , bread , soda and whatever other sugars and starches had made their way into my diet . Its a sacrifice , especially being in places with cheap beer and great bread , but it is well worth it as I feel MUCH better about myself and can tell I 've shed a significant part of that beer belly . I just realized that long-term travel is a lifestyle , not a vacation , and I have to make an effort to keep these healthy changes constant while Im gone . Glad to hear that you 're feeling better as well , and thanks for sharing in the first placeI thought I was the only one ! 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143290 @2543290/ <h> What we 've been up to <p> Back in April , sitting in Puerto Iguazu , Argentina , we made the decision to return to North America and Europe for the summer to take a much-needed rest . We accepted a housesit in New York , we would live in Berlin for a month , housesit in Tucson afterwards and rest up for the hectic second half of our overland travel through South America starting again in October . <p> It turns out , we are terrible at resting . Its about time we caught you up with where we are , where were going and where exactly we 've been . So here 's how our break really looked : <p> Two months living in Brooklyn Heights , New York , we stepped right in to the fast pace and explored the city top to bottom . In May there were still some chilly days and some rain , but June <p> Just once if you can visit New York in June , when even New Yorkers have an extra swing in their step and the weather is in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next up was a week spent apart . I was in Colorado visiting my best friend who was very pregnant and Dani spent an extra week in Germany with family before we met and headed to Berlin for five glorious weeks . June in Berlin can still be quite chilly but July <p> Just once if you can visit Berlin in July , when young and old , tattooed and not tattooed ( basically , that was only us ) lay out in parks , chat or work in cafes by day and do the same in trendy restaurants , pubs and clubs by night . Instead of resting , Berlin was all about working hard and playing harder . Here we had tons of built-in friends and fellow digital nomads , and eventually a tight-knit group of us spent time racing back and forth between East and West Berlin , spending evenings together at open-air cinemas , dinners and beer fests . It was a summer well never forget . <p> Then we hit the road and traveled for two weeks throughout Germany visiting friends and family until flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for four days before flying to Tucson to housesit . <p> Throughout the summer , Tucson had become a mirage , an oasis in the desert . Well rest in Tucson , we told ourselves . Well sit by the pool and relax , well work and play with our dog Millie , and just recover . And that 's almost what we did . <p> Except we took day trips down to Tubac , hiked Sabino Canyon , visited Saguaro National Park and re-visited the old pueblo ( Tucsons historic downtown ) and Mission San Xavier . <p> We also worked our tails off . We were interviewed twice on Rudy Maxas World a syndicated radio show which goes out to 700,000 listeners , were in talks and made a show reel for a possible reality TV show , worked on new projects , recorded new Break Free podcast interviews , made major headway with our exciting new website redesign ( coming this Fall ! ) , launched our new Escape Route travel planning service ( check that out here , and see if we can help you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> New Mexico road trip 2013 #2girls1chevy <p> During this time plans for a New Mexico road trip also crystallized . What was meant to be a two-week road trip through New Mexico has now evolved into an 19-day trip from Tucson to Chicago via Denver . Whenever we plan a road trip , it always grows and becomes an epic journey , like our 2011 NYC2NOLA road trip , when we meant to drive from New York to New Orleans . Instead we drove from Ottawa , Canada up through Montreal and Quebec City , down to Boston and then through the East , Southeast , to New Orleans and then up through Memphis and onward to Chicago . For our travel style , one-way car rental drop-offs are just easier and cheaper than two flights and returning the car to its pick-up location , so we always drive to a final destination rather than return the car and fly . <p> We left Tucson and began our New Mexico road trip last Friday and so far , the road trip has been a blast ( especially with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ! <p> New Mexico has so much to offer to those who make the trip here ! Some things , like the alien obsession here in Roswell , feel quirky , but the landscape and natural monuments are what make New Mexico truly otherworldly . In just the first five days of the road trip , we have- seen the Gila Cliff Dwellings , hiked across the incredible White Sands sand dunes , seen thousands of bats flying out of Carlsbad Caverns at dusk and then the next day , climbed down , down , down into the Earth and through the caves for three hours mind blowing ! We also drove for hours across southern New Mexico through tiny towns like Hatch , Carrizozo , Socorro and saw the Trinity Site , where the first nuclear bomb was detonated in 1945 . <h> What 's next for us <p> After Roswell , were off for a night in Las Vegas ( the one here in New Mexico ) before spending time in Albuquerque , Santa Fe and Taos . If you have any tips for any of these places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . <p> Well then take the back roads to Denver to again visit my best friend , this time with her brand new little baby , before beginning the last two day slog through the cornfields of Nebraska and Iowa into Chicago .

@@107143294 @2543294/ <h> Why mother is a four-letter word in Spanish Madre , a book review <p> When Liza got in touch with us to review Madre , we were more than happy to comply . After over 9 months in Latin America last year we fell head over heels for Latin culture and could n't wait to follow along on Lizas own journey . Enjoy ! <p> Ranging from b*itch to untalented to I do n't  give a sh*t , the word Madre ( Mother ) is used in everyday Spanish in hundreds , if not thousands , of negative expressions . From her days living in Mexico and after her return to the U.S. , - author and linguistic anthropologist Liza Bakewell , held countless conversations over the years with a truly eclectic set of friends and academics in attempt to uncover how the word mother became a four letter word. - Witnessing Bakewells passion to understand specific aspects of the Spanish language woven in with stories of her time spent in Mexico create an entertaining travelogue , as well as creating a blueprint for anyone who is serious about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latino , specifically Mexican , culture by posing questions to various friends and acquaintances that result in heated cultural debate , sharp intellectual discourse and rowdy laughter . <p> As Bakewell begins a spell in Mexico City , she notes graffiti on a wall which shouts A toda madre o un desmadre . Although she felt she was fairly fluent , she can only decode the phrase literally as to everything mother or an un-mother , which makes no sense . As she spends more time in Mexico , - she discovers that these sayings using the word madre make less and less sense to her . Why does des-madre ( un-mother ) describe someone who is a waste of space , and why does me vale madre ( literally : it is worth mother to me ) translate to I do n't  give a damn ? <p> Readers follow ready and willing along on this journey , which , for such an intellectual travelogue , is jam-packed with a spicy mix of four-letter words as we learn the translations for the plethora of disrespectful terms . The writing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and linguistic research is clearly very serious and logical . <p> While Madre delves in a very specific aspect of the Spanish language , even non Spanish speakers can be entertained . However one , perhaps unintentional , benefit of reading Madre is that this book holds the key to successful language learning within its pages . There is not one lesson , and that is not the books intent . With Madre , Bakewell subtly yet effectively highlights key learning habits for anyone serious about learning a foreign language . Becoming both bilingual and bicultural is made possible not from parroting back words or phrases from the teacher , but from taking an active part in understanding the culture in which each language is spoken . As a ( former ) English teacher , one of the most difficult hurdles was that while language learners may eagerly come to class with their dictionaries and sharpened pencils at the ready , the key to success is that tenacious mindset to understand the interwoven intricacies of language and culture . Only when you accept that you must learn both can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to Thailand next week , I will be taking my own advice to do the best I can to pick up as much Thai as possible from the locals . As Liza Bakewell puts it , language learning truly takes place in ethnographic laboratories " kitchen tables , bars , real life conversations and the subtitle of Madre says it all : You must dive in and take a journey with the language if you truly want to master it . <p> Thanks Rease ! You were right , the links did n't  work but we fixed them now . I think you 'd enjoy the book , and you already know so much when it comes to Spanish slang , so it would be right down your alley = <p> You 're welcome , Claire ! I have to admit that I was n't aware of it either before reading the book despite studying Spanish for several years ! Which shows , there 's always something new you can pick up when learning a foreign language , no matter how fluent you are = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

@@107143296 @2543296/ <p> We spent one day this week at the Elephant Nature Park north of Chiang Mai , an elephant sanctuary which is home to over 30 rescued elephants , mistreated by their previous owners . In a country where many elephants are still used to earn tourist money by offering rides or using them for begging in the streets , the founder of the park , Sangduen " Lek " Chailert , offers these previously abused elephants of all ages the chance to enjoy the rest of their lives naturally and without physical stress . It was an amazing experience seeing these giant animals up close , and we spent time feeding them and observing them as they interacted with the other elephants and their mahouts ( elephant caretakers ) in a natural habitat . One of our favorite parts of the day was when we bathed the elephants in the river two different times .

I was afraid my highly anticipated long weekend in Brighton might get rained out including the Pride Parade I was so looking forward to . <p> But the weather gods were on my side and by the time I took the train down to Brighton , the sun had come out and it had warmed up again .

@@107143301 @2543301/ <h> Abraham Hostel in Jerusalem : A home away from home <p> When I arrived at the Abraham Hostel in Jerusalem , it took me about ten minutes to know I 'd be feeling completely at home here during my stay . Would you like to participate in our Shabbat dinner tonight ? , I was asked during the quick and smooth check-in , to which I excitedly said Of course , yes ! . I had been invited to my first ever family Shabbat dinner the Friday before , and eight days after my first introduction to this wonderful Jewish tradition of an extensive and festive family dinner , I still found myself daydreaming about all the good food I had gotten to try at my friends moms house , so taking part in the one at the hostel was a no-brainer for me . I put my stuff down in my room and headed straight to the communal lounge to do some writing before the Shabbat dinner . Happy Hour had just started and I ordered myself a glass of the excellent local Israeli wine and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in small groups , laughing and talking , the bar was just starting to get busy , the hostel staff were mingling with the guests , and the volunteer staff were chopping away in the kitchen to get dinner ready in time . The music playing in the background was wonderfully relaxing , not the noisy dance music you get in some other hostels that have a bar . I knew that I 'd be feeling right at home here for the next six nights.Another indication that this was n't your typical party hostel : the guests were of all ages , ranging from couples in their 50s , solo travelers in their 30s to girlfriends in their 20s . There was a TV room just off the lounge , so if you were not in the mood to mingle , you could retire to the TV room , but if you were looking to meet people , there were plenty of opportunities to do so . The rooftop terrace with its comfy lounge sofas was another great spot to meet other travelers , or just sitting at the bar was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my arrival , had read that the hostel had 250 beds , I was a bit apprehensive , because I usually find those big hostel too impersonal , too loud , or too chaotic . My concerns were unfounded though at Abrahams , I never felt that there were that many people ( and I later learned that there were even 260 beds ) , even though the hostel is near full capacity almost all the time.Instead I found a hostel where I could have my privacy in my spacious en-suite single room on the third floor whenever I wanted , but I could also go mingle in the lounge or , after 6pm , at the bar , preferably during the great-value happy hour of course , or take the social aspect one step further by joining one of the nightly activities where you can get to know other travelers " perfect for solo travelers like me . There is the weekly Pub Crawl , a Mexican Taco night , movie nights , a weekly open-mic night or the already mentioned Shabbat dinner on Fridays.The dinner the volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home-cooked food I had had the Friday before . The options for vegetarians were plentiful and everything I tried was delicious and seeing how many people went for second helpings , I was not the only one who felt that way . The price tag for the Shabbat dinner , ILS30 ( US$7.70 ) , is also extremely affordable , especially considering the amount of food you get and compared to the pricey restaurants of Jerusalem . While the lounge was fairly busy during the dinner with around 50 people in attendance it still had an intimate feel to it , thanks to the guests being grouped around smaller tables , which also had the advantage that you could get to know one another.Even though I preferred the seclusion and quietness in my private room which came with a desk ( perfect for the writing I needed to catch up on ) and a small kitchenette with a full-size fridge , I was impressed with the four-bed female dorms when I peeked inside one of them one day . Not only was the room spacious and each bed had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table had been added just so that the girls could get ready in front of a full size mirror and spread out their make-up and toiletries . There was even a hair dryer ! The dorm also has a kitchenette , which is basically just a cupboard with a fridge ; the shared main kitchen is where you really find anything you need to make yourself a meal is downstairs right by the communal lounge , but it is nice to be able to store something in the room . With two stoves and ovens in the main hostel kitchen I never saw anybody having to wait to cook , and found the kitchen to be very clean . Plus : there is free tea and coffee in the kitchen all day long.The mornings were the best part though that 's when a fancy espresso machine magically appeared and allowed guests to wake up with a proper espresso or cappuccino instead of a simple Turkish coffee . I might have gone over-the-top with my morning espresso intake a couple of times during my stay at Abraham 's .. <p> In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nutella , cheese , hard boiled eggs and cereal and of course the for Israeli breakfasts essential cucumber and tomatoes , both of which were served in a big bowls . ( Side note : salad for breakfast might just be the best Israeli invention . ) All of this is offered self-service style and is included in the room rates.A great addition to the hostel itself is the tour company , Abraham Tours , in the reception area . Hostel guests get a discount on the tours offered , and if you can get several people to join a tour , there is an additional group discount . The list of tours is so long that I had difficulties deciding which ones I wanted to join . Abraham Tours basically offers tours to all of Israel 's main sights such as the Dead Sea , Haifa , Nazareth , and Masada , but you can even venture as far as Jordan , on a 3-day trip to Jerash , Petra and Wadi Rum , or Egypt on a 2-day tour from Eilat . <p> What impressed me the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were thrown in the mix of classic Israel highlights . In my opinion , people who visit Israel should also visit the West Bank to get a better understanding of the ongoing Israel Palestine conflict , but not everyone is comfortable to explore the Palestinian territories by themselves , so these tours are a great way to experience the West Bank with a qualified guide , also guaranteeing that you learn about the West Bank firsthand rather than just going there . I ended up going on three West Bank tours with Abraham ( which I will write about separately ) and these three days were among the most eye-opening in educating myself on the entire situation and to learn more about life in Palestine.I also took a cooking class with Abraham which I loved and cant stop raving about . I did n't  have a single bad meal during my month in Israel , and the dinner we prepared during this class was among the most memorable ones.Overall , I felt right at home at Abraham and am already looking forward to returning to Jerusalem were I know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Friendly staff <p> The staff can make or break a hostel , and Abraham is doing it just right when selecting their staff : every single person who was working at the hostel during my stay was always approachable , friendly and making sure that the guests were having everything they needed . There are even staff insider tips for Jerusalem on the Abraham website , but you can walk up to anyone at any time and get an answer to any question you might have . <h> Standout feature : The social activities and the tour desk <p> As I 've already said : the tour desk offers a fantastic range of activities all over Israel , and what could be better than sightseeing with new friends from the hostel while having a knowledgeable guide with you ? On every single one of the tours I took I felt well looked after and that the guides knew what they were talking about . Plus : If you stay at the hostel , you get a discount on any tour ! <p> There is even a message board to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl or the Shabbat dinner were nights when I felt like I could really get to know my fellow travelers at the hostel without having to try hard . I recommend taking part in at least one social activity , but if you hang out at the hostel bar , you also wo n't have any problems meeting new people . <h> Room for improvement <p> I have to admit that I found it really hard to find a flaw in this seemingly perfect hostel . I was trying hard to find something that was missing , but with the cozy lounge , the power outlets and reading lamps at every bed , free lockers , the bar with its great Happy Hour , the generous breakfast spread , the tours , a computer room with PCs to use for those who do n't  travel with a laptop , a laundry room , the wonderful rooftop terrace , and the clean , spacious rooms , I did n't  miss anything during my stay . <p> I loved the signs and decoration throughout the hostel <p> The only thing I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , the tables were usually sticky and a bit dirty . While the staff was always on top of refilling the buffet , I thought that they could be more on top of cleaning the messy spots on the tables . 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 3 Comments <p> Hi Dani , Your " room for improvement " has been noted we will be sure to improve !

@@107143302 @2543302/ <h> Hotel Tip of the Week : Temple Tree at Bon Ton Langkawi , Malaysia <p> Every time I see a rickety old building , I am reminded of our incredibly relaxing stay at Temple Tree <p> Of all the hotels in all the cities we have visited , we have never stayed anywhere quite like this resort . The property consists of eight antique villas from various Malaysian states , which were meticulously taken down piece by piece , sent to Langkawi and rebuilt here on site . The collection of houses are as multicultural as Malaysia itself with representations of Chinese , Malay , Indian and Eurasian styles . Each villa is individually designed , with a rough-luxe style that left us giddy when we first walked in to our loft in the Oriental building . <p> After a few weeks of heavy travel , we- arrived here with an ever-growing list of things to get done write posts , edit video , and then there 's that business I want to get to launchingInstead , we drink a delicious Chardonnay and take baths side by side in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two showers in the wet room complete with rain shower heads , organic exfoliating soap and a clay jar with shampoo ( refilled daily ) . After the baths and the white fluffy towels , we climb into a device which , disguised as a bed , could also be some top secret experiment to create the deepest nights sleep possible . We are enveloped by fluffy white pillows and several smaller colorful ones , and need only a crisp high thread count sheet to cover up in the humid Malaysian night . <p> The deep trance , otherwise known as nine entire hours of uninterrupted sleep , ends only by the piercing call of an unfamiliar exotic bird hanging out just outside the window . Breakfast is brought in each evening for the next day , so that in the morning we can grab it out of the fridge , make coffee and tea , and dig in on the fresh bread , jams , butter , fruits , yoghurt and two big pieces of spiced pineapple rum cake . Cakefor breakfast ? Nomnomnomnom <p> Sure , we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the entire experience felt so decadent that we devoured it on the worn-in red leather couch while we watched a DVD on our 42-inch flat screen TV . Cake and a film for breakfast ? Paradise ! - Without even mentioning our work needing to be finished , we followed the beckoning of the long , luxurious lap pool when the film ended . Here we read , felt the breeze through the palm trees and the long reeds in the fields behind us . We are served ice water in large tumblers , slice of lemon and all . <p> Eventually , we figure we 've got to go explore the island , and so we manage to pack up and leave for the beach , a five minute cab ride away . We eat , we lay , we swim and frolic and couldnt be happier to be in Langkawi . And yet the only place I wanted to be was back at homeat Temple Tree . <p> Not everything is perfect , of course , but the problems are predicted and dealt with before we even have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquito . Because the buildings are very old , there are plenty of open spots for mosquitoes to get through but we are bitten less here than anywhere else we have stayed in Malaysia , thanks to the mosquito zappers that the staff plugs in each evening at dusk when they come in and pull down your mosquito net and bring your breakfast for the next day . The room also comes equipped with all-natural bug spray , a local all-natural antihistamine , called Gamat , which reduces swelling and itching if we had been bit. - We also find flashlights , international adapters , and a pool buddy a wooden box to carry sunscreen , water and books back and forth to the pool each day . Beautiful typically Asian sarongs hang in the closet and are free for us to use both at the pool and even to bring to the beach . We can purchase them at the end of the stay for only $8 eacha fair price , but we do n't  as we both already have our own . <p> The price of the sarong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that is that the Value For Money factor here is fabulous . The room rate starts at just under $200 a night , but what would you pay to feel entirely carefree ? Both Temple Tree and the neighboring Bon Ton resort ( same owner , same general design concept ) have top-quality restaurants with both Malaysian and the Mediterranean options . We opted for Mediterranean the night we ate Bon Ton , including goat cheese and eggplant bruschetta , four cheese pizza tapas , and a spinach , rocket , olive and Halloumi salad with chunks of fresh avocado and pistachios . As we watched the fire red sunset , we calculated the bill : under $30 for two at a luxury resort . Not bad We were too full to sample the dessert plates , something we now regret when- thinking about the chocolate plate , the cheese plate , or the more creative desserts like the Ice Cream Sandwich Duo a gingerbread sandwich with local Kaya ice-cream in the middle and a brownie sandwich with chocolate ice-cream and caramelized bananas . <p> It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airport , and take-offs and landings are a part of the stay here but there are so few that this is more of an interesting novelty than anything bothersome . Something had to break up the blissful solitude , like a little pinch me to make us realize just how lucky we were to have been hereSome people have mentioned on Tripadvisor that Temple Tree should be more open about the number of cats that live on site . The owner , Narelle , is an animal lover , and has opened up a shelter on the island , LASSie . Some of the cats and a few dogs live here on site . The others are located at a nearby shelter . Although I am allergic to cats , between the breeze and the open windows , I had no problems and Dani ( our resident cat-lover ) was in heaven , of course . In fact , having our pet cat hop through the window made Temple Tree feel even more like home . <h> Stand Out feature " - Take me to my Villa , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drawers , that bed , the showers and did we mention the incredible lighting that makes just about any mood possible ? - There were so many stand-out features here , but the overriding feature is the feeling of having our own loft inside of a three-loft Oriental villa . For the money , you do not get a standard ( however creatively designed ) hotel room . At Temple Tree you get to live inside of a colonial Malaysian villa and feel absolutely at home . <h> Room for Improvement The Breakfast <p> The truth is , that while we loved the breakfast that first morning , it would have gotten boring to eat this every morning throughout a week 's vacation . - Guests might prefer a bit of choice or varied choices each day . An easy solution might be to offer a slip of paper with a limited menu ( fruit , instant oatmeal , hard-boiled eggs , toast and/or yoghurt , plus fruit and that delicious cake ) that guests fill out which is picked up in the evening during turn-down service . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stay on Langkawi , and we would go so far as to call this resort a destination itself . You may come for the island feeling , but you will stay ( or at least want to ) for all the luxury minus the stuffiness . <p> Ill be taking what will be my 5th trip in 3 years to Temple Tree in May . Safe to say I am completely addicted to the place &amp; will also be volunteering for 4 days in the shelter before I sit back &amp; relaxI can not wait ! Narelle &amp; all the staff do such an amazing job , its an honour to stay there = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

The- Germans themselves will tell you Berlin is dirty , crowded , infested with foreigners and low-life unemployed lazies leeching off the social system the rest of the country pays for . <p> And believe us , the locals do n't want you there either . Talk of neighborhood gentrification and skyrocketing rental prices is what you 'll hear them talk about . <p> The funny this is , if locals are having a conversation , it is most likely taking place in English , not German . Locals are just the hodge podge mix of expats who got here before you from around the world . We heard English everywhere . <p> Expats and foreigners of all kinds have always felt at home in Berlin . After WWII , Turkish immigrants came to West Berlin as extra labor to help construct the wall , while East Berlin welcomed their fellow communist Vietnamese comrades to work . Today , those two communities are very large and integrated into Berlins fabric . <p> The German capital has always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the war ended , West Berliners were exempt from otherwise mandatory military service . This drew Social activists , pacifists , anarchists , musicians and artists in droves the latter two even received state subsidies to support their projects . The post-war culture laid the groundwork for what has easily become the least German German city . <p> There is a state of controlled chaos in Berlin , yet it is a chaos so controlled it could only exist in Germany . <p> Remaining parts of the wall can be seen throughout the city <p> At first glance , or even after five weeks , it would appear that half the city is unemployed . <p> This is judging by the number of people sipping coffee at sidewalk cafes all afternoon long or spending the day grilling in the park or drinking wine well past sunset on riverbanks and other green spaces around town . Berlin is , in fact , one of the greenest cities we have ever spent time in . <p> And yet nothing ever seems to get out of control with all this free time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locals walk around in some degree of altered state . <p> It is a mystery why things stay on such an even keel , especially since there is hardly ever a police officer in sight . <p> The German capital moved to Bonn after the war , leaving much of Berlin leveled . Lack of development and investment in the city throughout the following decades is what kept it so green . Upon re-unification , Berlin regained capital status in 1991 , though offices only really moved back in 1999 . Still today , many government officials work from offices in Bonn . This explains how in the capital of one of the worlds mightiest economies , you 'd have to really search for someone wearing a suit . <p> The Reichstag , home of the German parliament , therefore a rare buttoned up place in Berlin . <p> The lack of investment met with limited major industry is partially what has kept much of the population underemployed and created some of the characteristic Berlin grit . Now , this is grit by German standards , of course . <p> Compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And with food , drinks and over cost of living expenses so low , we often did compare Berlin to Bangkok . <p> Our rent for five weeks was only $200 more than what we paid in Thailand and our average meal was $6 a plate . <p> Lunch is usually around G5 . The special on the right includes soup , bread , rice , salad and a main course for G4.90 . <p> So Berlin is green , and cheap , and populated with bon vivants . But there is a serious , sad side to the city that is impossible to overlook . <p> Every single cobblestone you stumble on is connected to history , starting quite literally , with the Stolpersteine , or stumble stones ' 5,000 gold plated memorial stones on sidewalks in front of homes of Jewish and other people who lost their lives in concentration camps . There are 38,000 of these now all around Europe , but Berlin is home to one of the largest concentrations of them . <p> Stolpersteine have the name of the person , when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Look closely at some buildings on either side of what was the Berlin Wall , and you 'll see plaques marking where escape tunnels were dug under the Wall over the years . There is a constant feeling in Berlin that you are somewhere that really matters , a major player in world history . Just imagine what the streets of the city have witnessed from the citys founding in the 12th Century through to today . <p> The plaque on top marks where the wall was located , the one on the bottom left where a person was arrested in the attempt to escape over the wall , the one on the bottom right marks the successful escape of three men . <p> The Berlin Wall itself is an ever-present feature of the city . Individuals slabs are found throughout the city as memorials , but the largest concentration of remaining wall can be found at the East Side Gallery , the longest remaining piece of the wall . <p> However , in true Berlin form , the East Side Gallery is n't just a sad memorial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express and communicate message related to the wall , the war , hope , freedom , intercultural understanding or simply incredible graffiti art . <p> The heavy irony was not lost on us as we cycled back and forth between the east and west sides of Berlin everyday . We did so freely and yet , as a child in the former DDR , Dani would not have even been allowed into West Germany ( she could have been shot for it ) let alone would she have been cycling back and forth across it with her American girlfriend one day . <p> And did we ever cycle ! <p> Berlin is such an amazing city for cycling , with countless miles of bike lanes that crisscross through neighborhoods and lead to lakes and parks far out of town , too . <p> We cycled 20km almost every day , past major sights like Alexandarplatz and the TV tower , through the Brandenburg Gate , along along the Wall , and through Checkpoint Charlie on our way to visit friends , test out as many international restaurants as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some days we stayed in our own hood , Kreuzberg , which is where Turkish immigrants stayed and settled . Today it is a bustling international area where rebel youth and Turkish grandmas co-exist , often lined up at the same shops for ethnic food , or shopping at the same Turkish market on Tuesdays and Fridays . We went here very week to stock up on- fruit , veg , cheeses , breads and olives . <p> Maybachufer Turkish Market in Berlin Kreuzberg <p> Our other favorite neighborhood is Prenzlauer Berg . <p> This is one of those places locals love to have the gentrification conversation . Just go on a walk , and you 'll hear how this was an abandoned building two years ago , the buildings on this street were all an ugly gray until last year , or Rents here have gone up so much since last year. We were just swooned by the tree-lined streets , imaginative cafes and weekly food and craft markets set up throughout P-Berg . <p> Each neighborhood is distinct , with its own feel and a specific type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ku'Damm , poor folk and punks in Neuk+lln <p> Most noticeable though is how you immediately know that you have crossed from East to West Berlin the architecture , the little green and red men on the traffic lights and the tram that exists only on the east side . <p> Alexanderplatz and the TV Tower : Iconic East Berlin . The TV Tower can be seen from almost anywhere in the city . <p> Public transportation options abound in this city . The summer should strictly be for cycling , but in the winter , you can choose between that tram ( east only ) the elevated S-bahn network , the underground U-Bahn , buses , trains , taxis and there has even been a major boom in services similar to Zipcar . Over 10 companies allow you to rent cars by the hour or for the day all for extremely low rates . <p> Old-fashioned subway station in Berlin <p> So why do Germans think it is so awful ? <p> Maybe its the party and club culture that takes place all night long ? Clubs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , not Germany. - Some clubs never even close at all . <p> And let 's say that sounds appealing to you good luck getting in . Berlin has been up-and-coming for long enough that there is a very careful curation of cool in most of them . Odds are , you 're not getting past the doorman . <p> Clubs post very specific signs such as No American Hipsters Allowed ' out front to make sure you know where you 're not wanted . <p> Berlins Rockboot party boat <p> Do n't  worry though it 's not like there is nowhere else to hang out . This is a city where brunch is a meal celebrated seven days a week , and is available until 4pm so you do n't even have to get up before noon . <p> For more quintessential Berlin spots , there are three places that encapsulate the Berlin vibe . <p> The first is the Badeschiff . <p> There is no swimming allowed in the Spree river , so some creative types took an old wooden boat , hollowed it out and made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the city and its surrounded by a beach and a bar . Entry is only 5 Euros to spend the day there , too . <p> The second is Sunday Karaoke in Mauerpark , where thousands of people gather in amphitheater seating to listen to the few brave souls willing to get up and sing karaoke songs in front of the massive audience . <p> When you mess up , forget the words , or act awkward , the crowd does n't boo or hiss they encourage you , applaud and cheer you on . <p> The third is Tempelhof Airport , a pre-WWII airport closed for good in 2008 . <p> Rather than develop this space with condos ( though the fight for this was intense ) the massive landspace was left as is and in 2010 officially became a city park . Today , thousands of Berliners sprawl in the fields , jog , cycle , skate or kite-board down the 5km landing strip , play mini-golf , pick vegetables at communal farm-shares or jam at concerts near the terminal buildings . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not surprising . The fact that condo developers were kept at bay makes us think that some government officials might actually be throwing on their skinny jeans and kite-boarding , too , while their colleagues frequent the city 's opera houses or- theaters , spend the night- listening to the philharmonic , - stroll through contemporary art museums or watch independent international films at art house cinemas . <p> Let 's be clear that Berlin is as high brow as it is punk. - Hell you- might even find a bar called High Brow Punk somewhere in Neuk+lln . <p> It is a city where Spanish hipsters rub elbows with pram-pushing yuppie mommies at Vietnamese restaurants , and the German busker on- the corner might suddenly find himself singing a duet with the original British rockstar , out for a walk with his dog . <p> The city demands that you add your own flavor , not to conform to what 's already there. - Speak your own language , build your own life , make it your own . <p> We just hope that Berlin does n't  lose the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and the fact that we want to dissuade you makes us feel like locals already . Berlins not perfect . Its gritty and green , international and easy-to-maneuver .

I obviously did n't  go to the right places ! Maybe it has changed a lot in the past 6 1/2 years also . When I am travelling through that way again I will definitely give it another chance . Great article = <p> You have made me so jealous ! I cant wait to go back to Berlin one day . The massive history combined with the awesome and unique arty people , and all the graffiti , makes it such a special place . I 'm glad to hear that so many people speak English there too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I always thought it would be impossible as I do n't  speak a word of German ! Do you think you could live there without knowing German ? = <p> We went to Berlin a couple of years ago for a weekend and loved it . In fact , its probably one of our favourite places in Europe now . Loved this blog post , shows off Berlin at its finest especially enjoyed the photographs . Want to go in that swimming pool ! <p> Now Prague is a city which has been ruined by tourists . But in Berlins case , the tourists blend in , and add a new layer to the city . Ive been there many times , and would not appreciate a cool German telling me off for visiting . <p> People are too cool to tell you off about anything . But you do notice the conversations happening all the time about gentrification , rent , changes in the neighbhorhoods , etc . But remember that for German , commiserating ( ie , small complaints that everyone can agree on ) is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Prague , that 's for sure . <p> Germany is so dang civilised ! Even in seedy Berlin parks families and sunbathers share the space with the drug dealers , who do n't  blast their music TOO loud or make anyone feel unsafe ( or at least , that was our impression over the course of an afternoons observations ) . <p> Its crazy that I 'm from the UK and I still havent been to Berlin . I do n't  care what the locals say I 'm going to visit when I 'm back in Europe ! And its good for me that lots of people speak English because my German recollection is shocking ! <p> Awesome post ! I really appreciate the tidbits of history you include along with providing observations of the locals and their thoughts of the city . I visited Berlin recently for the first time and while I cant say its one of my favorite cities , I can appreciate this post ! <p> Keisha- finally got around to reading your post .. I am so sorry that you had such a bad experience in Berlin ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second try a ) when I 'm in town to introduce you to some nice people and b ) when its warmer !

@@107143304 @2543304/ <h> Eating my way through Israel <p> Israel has ruined me for life . Not a single day goes by that I 'm NOT thinking about the glorious food I had there . No matter if it 's the juicy olives , the soft warm pita bread , the bread shops in general , the most excellent shakhuka , eggplants cooked to absolute perfection , scrumptious couscous , and I do n't even want to mention the hummus , the wonderful hummus , which just has n't tasted as good anymore since I left Israel . I am telling you : The food in Israel ruins you for life . I was perfectly fine with the mediocre hummus I had been eating before I went to Israel , but after I tried Said 's hummus in Acre , I realized that as a matter of fact , I 'd never even had good hummus before ! But I am getting ahead of myself " let 's start at the beginning . <h> What is Israeli food ? * <p> Israel is a culinary melting pot of the cuisines of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's State of Israel over the centuries . The spices , scents and flavors of Northern Africa , mixed together with Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine and traditional Jewish dishes make Israel 's cuisine truly unique , and most of all : extremely diverse and flavorful . Dishes like shawarma and baklava are just as common as schnitzel , borsht and chopped liver . Other dishes that you 'll come across over and over again " served in eateries ranging from cheap street food stalls to fancy restaurants are falafel , olives , fresh fish , kebab and hummus.One thing I loved about Israel was how fresh everything was fruits and vegetables are bought in big open markets rather than sterile supermarkets , fresh fruit juices are made to order at little food stalls , and mobile bakery carts are selling fresh breads and baked goods as the vendors are wheeling their carts around town . Flavorsome spices are prevalent in all the markets , as are dried fruits and nuts . <h> Israeli breakfast <p> Breakfast is my absolute favorite meal of day in Israel . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My all-time favorite Israeli dish ! Funnily enough , I was introduced to Shakshuka in an Israeli restaurant in Guatemala ( side note : if you find yourself in a country where meat is prevalent in all dishes , look for an Israeli restaurant . There are always plenty of veggie options there. ) and even though I 've had it in many places all around the world , I was excited to try it in Israel . So what exactly is shakshuka ? It is an egg dish for which eggs are baked in a tasty tomato sauce made of tomatoes , peppers , onions , garlic , chili and other spices . In some places , you 'll find it with additional ingredients such as eggplant , feta cheese or even shrimps . When you order it in a restaurant , it is served in the cast-iron pan that it is made in . I was even more delighted when one of my Israeli friends told me that it was perfectly acceptable to eat shakshuka for lunch and dinner , too . I could eat it three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular shakshuka place in Israel is without a doubt Dr Shakshuka in Jaffa south of central Tel Aviv , which started out at as a small food shack and has now evolved into a spacious restaurant with several shakshukas on the menu . I have to admit though that I was n't too fussed about the shakshuka I had there ( or maybe my expectations were just too high , after hearing so many people rave about this place ? ) and had better shakshukas around Israel , for example at Cafe Nadi in Jerusalem.Mezze <p> The other breakfast that I could n't get enough of is the mezze breakfast . Here , a variety of dips and cheeses , olives and fried vegetables like roasted cauliflower , baba ghanoush ( an eggplant paste ) , tahini ( sesame paste ) , zhough ( chili paste with garlic , coriander and cumin ) and of course hummus are served with several breads " and let 's talk about the bread for a minute : As a German , I am very picky with my bread , and do n't approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , I could n't get enough of the fresh bread and fell in love with all the bread shops . Many cafes have their own bakery on site and bake all sorts of breads ( rye , wholegrain , etc ) there . That 's why the bread is always super fresh and extremely scrumptious . Bread is by the way a part of almost any meal in Israel , be it the typical Arab pita bread , Jewish Rosh Hashanah , Sabbat and Challah bread or the scrumptious Israeli bread , so for people who try to avoid bread " good luck doing that in Israel ( but where 's the fun in eating hummus without scooping it up with pita bread anyway ? ) With the mezze breakfast spread you usually get to order eggs any style , and what 's never missing : a side salad . Eating salad for breakfast might sound weird to some people , but I loved it . The salad is usually made of cucumbers ( Israel has a distinctive type of tiny cucumber " much smaller than the ones we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peppers and onions . <h> Common vegetarian dishes in Israel <p> What I also loved about Israel is that is so vegetarian-friendly . I love it when I 'm in a country and I do n't feel like I am missing out on local delicacies because I do n't eat meat . In Israel , I never felt like I missed out , and here are some of my favorite vegetarian dishes : <p> Hummus <p> Hummus is one of the most popular Israeli dishes , and these days found all over the world . It is made out of chickpeas , tahini , olive oil , garlic , salt and lemon juice . Like I said in the beginning though : even though you can get hummus all over the world , you do n't know what a really good hummus tastes like until you try it in Israel . My absolute favorite hummus shop was Sa'id in the old town of Acre , an ancient fishing town in the far north of Israel . I would go back to Israel just to eat the still warm hummus with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fried little balls of heaven are , just like hummus , widely available in most parts of the world . It is debatable if they are truly of Israeli origin , but falafel is one of those Middle Eastern foods that have made their way into the Israeli diet and is now considered the national dish . They are deep-fried balls made of chickpeas ( sometimes fava beans , or a mix of both ) , and usually served with tahini , the aforementioned sesame paste that is a main staple in Israel , hummus and / or pita bread . You can find falafel everywhere , from tiny roadside stalls to high-end restaurants . I 've had both the cheap version and fancier ones what they all had in common was that they were mouthwatering delicious.Eggplant <p> Eggplant is a classic ingredient in the Israeli cuisine , typically served in two different ways : as baba ghanoush ( a pureed and seasoned eggplant dip ) and baked in the oven . When baked in the oven , the eggplants are usually baked as a whole , including the skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Turkish pastry Borek ' , made from thin layers of filo dough that is filled with cheese , spinach or mushrooms , sometimes other ingredients . They are fried or baked and are a popular snack food which can be found in most bakeries or vendors who offer just bureka . They are eaten at any time of day . Tip : Get them when they are fresh out of the oven . Another tasty bread dish that has been brought to Israel by Georgian Jews is Khachapuri , a savory cheese filled pastry that is topped with a fried egg.Tabouleh <p> Tabouleh is a popular salad made of tomatoes , parsley , mint , onion , bulgur and seasoned with olive oil , lemon juice , and salt . It is not only eaten in Israel , but all over the Middle East . <h> Learning how to make Israeli food <p> Since I am such a big fan of Israeli food , I was eager to learn how to make some of my favorite dishes at home . Luckily , Abraham Tours offered a Cooking Class and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn how to cook Israeli food , but also more about Israeli food culture in general . Our bubbly tour guide Samantha started our tour at Mahane Yehuda Market , Jerusalem 's big main market which is well worth a visit , even if you 're not planning to pick up fresh produce , but I will tell you more about the market in my article on Jerusalem . As we walked through the maze of fruit and vegetable , cheese and fish , bakery and olive stalls , we learned that chick peas , onions , tomatoes , cucumber , coriander and sesame are the basis of many Israeli dishes . Rice is prevalent , and lentils are also a staple in the country , but also couscous and bulgur ( both are grains ) are very popular.Fresh food , and especially vegetables , are used in almost every meal : juicy tomatoes , purple eggplant , chilis , peppers in all colors . Jewish tradition brought Eastern European and Russian dishes such as borscht , schnitzel , chopped liver , cooked chicken and gefilte Fish to Israel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fish is ubiquitous in Israel . A popular fish dish that originates in Northern Africa is harimeh ( a spicy fish dish with tomatoes , garlic , cayenne pepper and caraway ) . After our market tour , we returned to the hostel with enough ingredients to prepare a feast for at least 20 people , and start cooking . On the menu : <p> Smoked Eggplant with Feta Cheese and Tahini <p> Tahini paste <p> Tabouleh Salad <p> Grilled Cauliflower with Silan ( date syrup ) <p> Kohlrabi and Fennel Salad <p> Mediterranean Rice ( with an amazing spice mix we bought in the market " I went back later to buy some more of those ) <p> Hamshuka ( Spiced Minced Meat Stew ) for the meat eaters <p> Cooking up all these items was just as much fun as the visit to the market had been . Samantha divided us into smaller groups ( 1 " 2 people ) and each pair was in charge of a specific dish . We were taught how to cut the vegetables for each dish , how to cook or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . I have already made some of the dishes I learned from Samantha at several Mediterranean-themed dinner parties ( the eggplant , tahini , tabouleh , Mediterranean rice and grilled cauliflower ) and they were always a huge success.The market tour and cooking class at Abraham Hostel was one of my highlights in Jerusalem and if you are interested in learning more about Israeli food culture and how to cook some Israeli dishes , I highly recommend taking this private class ( you do n't have to stay at the hostel to sign up for it , but if you stay at Abraham 's , you get a discount for the class ) . Abraham is now also offering a hummus workshop which I will definitely take the next time I am in Jerusalem . Like I said : Eating hummus in Israel will ruin you for life and turn you into a hummus snob . So what better place to learn how to make a proper hummus than in Israel ? The workshop does include eating all the hummus you prepare , of course ! Trust me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can spend in Jerusalem . <h> Israel = Dessert Heaven ! <p> We ca n't talk about Israeli food without mentioning some of the amazing desserts , or the reason I came back from Israel six pounds heavier , nearly not able to close my Dirndl . <p> Jewish pastries <p> Jewish pastries are actually very similar to German cakes , cookies and pastries and are widely available in the bakeries everywhere.Halva <p> Halva is a pastry that is made of sesame and to which ingredients like honey , vanilla , pistachios , cacao , almonds or nuts are added . In the markets , halva is sold in huge cake-like chunks of which the amount you desire is cut off , almost like a slice of cake . Halva is one of the most quintessential Israeli sweets and you ca n't leave Israel without trying it ( in the markets they usually offer free samples ) . Baklava <p> The most famous Middle Eastern sweet , a pastry made from nuts or pistachio , honey , syrup and filo . These are available in most bakeries in all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of my favorite desserts I 've had in Israel , even though the very best one I had was in Ramallah , and if you visit the West Bank ( which you should ! ) make sure to have a Kanafeh while you 're there . It is made of super thin pastry shreds soaked in sweet syrup , with a soft white cheese center and topped with pistachios.Arabiv coffee <p> You are typically served Arabic coffee ( also known as Turkish coffee ) with your sweets , which is brewed in a special pot and spiced up with cardamom . You drink it strong , black and from a small cup.Have you been to Israel ? What 's your favorite Israeli food ? <h> *This is NOT a comprehensive guide to Israeli cuisine but rather a brief introduction with an emphasis on vegetarian dishes and foods Ive developed an addiction for enjoyed while I was traveling around Israel . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <p> Your mouthwatering post has just described my food heaven ! Falafel , hummus , chickpeas , pita , and a side of tabouleh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pics and the tip about the cooking class ! <p> If you go back to Israel , you must try Oveds sabich in Givatayim . It is the absolute best eggplant sandwich you can get in the country . It is hard to describe , but worth the short trip to the suburbs . <p> Israelis always say that their hummus is better than anywhere so I will have to try it there one day . Best falafel I have ever had was in Egypt , where they make it with fava beans instead of chickpeas and are so good ! <p> A quick question : you talk about an Israeli restaurant in Guatemala at the beginning of the post . Is it either Hummus Ya or Zoola in San Pedro on Lake Atitlan shores ? I have been to both of them ; wonderful post , BTW ! <p> In continuation to my last post , I guess you stayed in Abraham hostel in Jerusalem , right ? Did you enjoy your stay there ? I think staying at Abraham hostel also helps taking the early morning bus trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mahane Yehudi market ! I have n't been to Ramallah , but went to a cafe in Beit Sahour ( http : //www.singercafe.com ) in West Bank , which had yummy chocolate croissants and also an interesting place to mingle with the locals . <p> I just feel I havent explored Jerusalem well enough and cant wait to go there again . The pictures of the desserts are almost forcing me to book my next trip to Israel soon . <p> Also , hope you do n't  mind so many questions about your trip and also occasionally sharing my own experiences ! <p> Jenny I am actually returning to Tel Aviv in a couple of days , so your comment comes at a perfect time = I 'd be happy about recommendations for places to eat on a budget cheapie hole-in-the=wall kinda places , bars with happy hours , etc . Ca n't wait to go back to Israel ! ! = = = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Easy to navigate , 1,000 Places is clearly divided into logical geographical sections , starting with Europe . Next up is Africa , a section which includes islands in the Indian Ocean , like our personal dream destination : the Maldives . <p> Next is the Middle East , a chapter filled with places we have not touched at all yet , then Asia , and on to Australia , New Zealand and the islands in the Pacific , followed by the U.S. and Canada , Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You 'll find classic Must-See ' destinations such as the Vatican , Machu Picchu , the Pyramids of Giza or the Great Wall , but also lesser known destinations such as Panama 's San Blas islands , Chicago 's Art Institute , the Gower Peninsula in Wales or Ottawa 's Rideau Canal ( all of these lesser-knowns , except for San Blas , we have seen ) .

Instead of merging our opinions into one , were starting a new series , She Said , She Said , where we both tell our side of the story about events and experiences while we travel . - In our first article in the series , find out Danis perspective of our afternoon out at the colorful La Boca neighborhood of Buenos Aires and then read on to find out what Jess thought about this popular tourist attraction. - <h> She Said : Dani 's perspective of La Boca <p> The images of the colorful houses in Caminito , an alleyway-turned-street museum in the neighborhood of La Boca , were some of the pictures that had stuck in my head the most when I was researching our trip to Buenos Aires . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1800s , mainly populated by people who were employed at the nearby river mouth ( boca ' in Spanish , hence the name ) where a shipyard was located . <p> When the port was moved , many people also left the neighborhood , leaving houses abandoned , particularly around El Caminito . An artist who lived nearby started to paint the fading houses in the 1950s , laying the groundwork for what Caminito is today : a street museum , combining colorful houses , tango music and platefuls of steak . La Boca had very few visitors just a few years ago , but nowadays it is filled with busloads of tourists at all times . I did n't care about it being touristy , the colors of the houses are a photographer 's dream and I knew I wanted to visit Caminito . <p> The minute we got off the bus in La Boca I realized how much more of a tourist trap El Caminito was than I had thought : tango dancers were staging for photos in front of the restaurants , and even props for tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo walls where visitors can stick their heads through were lined up along the Plazeta de los Suspiros , market stalls selling tourist trinkets were set up , and eager waiters tried to divert us into their restaurants . <p> I guess that I would have been disappointed about how set up ' everything felt had I not known what to expect before I went . Instead of letting the tourist circus bring me down , I decided to focus on what I came here for : photographing the colorful houses . We were visiting on a perfect spring day with blue skies and lots of sun , and it was a glorious day to take pictures . <p> Later , we sat down in one of the restaurants to watch one of the tango shows that were on in every single restaurant along Magallanes , the main road off El Caminito .

I opted for a coffee instead and even though we knew how touristy the whole thing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant during the day and see tango dancers ) , but we saw the best Argentine stomach tango to date . <p> My tip:I would still recommend a visit to La Boca , even though it is touristy and does not reflect the true Buenos Aires in any way . As long as you know what you 're in for , you can still enjoy a stroll around the neighborhood , maybe pick up a couple of souvenirs and watch some tango . <h> She Said : Jessica 's perspective of La Boca <p> Meh . That 's pretty accurately described how I felt on the bus on the way to La Boca , just outside downtown Buenos Aires .

Instead , while you could consider El Caminito an outdoor museum of sorts , it is the definition of a tourist trap and a caricature of its former self . <p> Hordes of people , both Argentinians and foreigners , shuffle along the streets lined with souvenir shops and overpriced restaurants taking pictures of people and scenes created purely for tourists to take pictures of . <p> The restaurants all have low-rent tango shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water .

@@107143312 @2543312/ <h> Where to stay in Bogota : The Hilton <p> Confession : There are times when I feel a little bit intimated when visiting a new place . It does n't  happen often , mainly in massive cities I 've never been to , like Hong Kong or Mexico City . And I 've found the best way to make myself feel more at ease and comfortable in a case like this is by staying in a nice place . <p> Bogota was one such place . When I planned my trip to Bogot+ and pulled up a map of the city , I felt intimidated immediately . 7 million people Bogot+ is gigantic ! And it does n't  have the best reputation.So staying in a nicer neighborhood for the first few days was important for me , and I was told that the Chapinero area would be perfect for me . Its one of Bogot+s nicer neighborhoods , with a lot of big international companies having their offices here , and plenty of fancy coffee shops , restaurants and bars . <p> When I found out that the Hilton had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I often prefer small independent boutique hotels , but sometimes I opt for the familiarity of a brand I know and appreciate , and in this case I wanted to go with a brand I knew , I trusted and I liked.I knew that I made the right decision as soon as my taxi pulled up at the hotel and the concierge got my luggage out of the car quicker than I could pay my driver . Throughout my entire stay , I was amazed by the level of outstanding customer service at the hotel . And even though I arrived before 2pm , I could check into my room without any problems and take a refreshing shower after my flight . <p> The spacious , glass-walled shower with a powerful rain showerhead might have been my favorite thing about my room , but then there were also the splendid views from the oversized windows that I could n't get enough of , and my uber-comfortable king size bed . It was hard not to feel at ease here ! Since I was a little hungry , I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the neighborhood at the same time . I couldve just ordered something from the extensive in-room menu which I found very reasonably priced and which had several options for vegetarians , but I wanted to get a feel for the neighborhood before going out at night . To my delight , there were several restaurants , coffee shops and convenience stores within a couple of blocks of the hotel , and after picking up a salad at a health food store , I could n't help but popping into Devotion , the coffee shop on the ground floor of the Hilton . One of my favorite coffee shops in Brooklyn is named Devotion , and I was ecstatic when I found out that it was actually the New York branch of this very coffee shop ! The coffee was amazing , but I did n't  have any doubt that it would n't be anything less than terrific , and I loved the contemporary stylish design of the coffee shop so much that I ended up bringing my laptop here to do some work . For coffee lovers , Devotion is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coffee aficionados can choose between pour overs , espresso drinks , sif+n or French press coffee , and there is a Kyoto Cold Slow Dripper for tasty cold brews.Speaking of contemporary and stylish that 's how I felt about the Hilton in general , I loved the modern look of the lobby and the artsy design features throughout the building . One evening when I left for a night out , there was even a red carpet event in the hotels Levels bar , which was still going strong when I returned the Hilton Bogot+ seemed to be a happening place at weekends , but of course you would n't notice any of this in the quiet rooms above . Even though the hotel sits right on the busy Carrera 7 , I never heard any street noise through the double glass windows in fact I had some of the best nights sleep here that I had in all of Colombia ! After checking out the amazing breakfast buffet the next morning , which was one of the best and varied breakfasts Ive seen in all of Latin America ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gym , which turned out to be much bigger than expected . A pet peeve of mine is a hotel advertising a gym and then only offering a tiny room crammed with machines but the Hilton knows how to do it right .

Let 's not forget that Bogot+ sits at an altitude of 8,612 feet . ) I really appreciate a gym to work out in.The gym opens up right to a large outdoor pool , by the way , and since Bogot+ never gets cruelly hot , you 'll be delighted to hear that the water is heated . And during my stay it was actually hot enough to make me want to lounge by the pool for a couple of hours.The highlight of my weekend at the Hilton was without a doubt the scrumptious Sunday brunch at La Ventana Restaurant . This is not your ordinary hotel brunch instead , you have world class chefs ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that range from fresh fish to homemade pasta , prepared right in front of you by a chef who knows what it takes to make pasta that tastes as if it came straight out of an Italian mamas kitchen.The generous brunch buffet , which follows the farm-to-table concept and focuses on using fresh local produce , was filled with more food than I could possibly try : exotic Colombian fruit , freshly baked bread , a cheese selection and salads , made-to-order egg dishes and waffles , to name just a few , and my favorite section : the desert buffet , which was out of this world ! The dessert chef is one of the most acclaimed chefs in his field , so I made sure to leave room for a sweet treat to finish my meal and i am so glad I did . It was divine but everything I had during brunch was worth every single calorie . An extra bonus during brunch ? The coffee served comes straight from Devocion !

The helpful and attentive concierge and reception staff can give you recommendations for pretty much anything , and arrange dinner reservations for you.Two shopping malls , El Castillo and Avenida Chile Shopping Center , are both a short walk away , and if you want to visit Bogot+s historic center , it does n't  take longer than 20 minutes to get there by cab . Taxis are cheap and plentiful in Bogot+ , so you 're not really far from anywhere , and my ride from the airport to the hotel only took about 25 minutes . <p> No matter if you find yourself in Bogot+ for business ( the Hilton sits right in the heart of the financial district ) or for pleasure the Hilton Bogot+ is a solid choice for both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my time in Bogot+ in from my comfortable room to the food I 've enjoyed to the coffee at Devotion and to the fabulous pool , plus the fabulous attentive staff my time at the Hilton was perfect . 129336 @qwx989336 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

Even though summer is obviously the best time to visit Cornwall , it is an absolutely gorgeous spot year-round . <h> Newcastle <p> Newcastle , often overlooked as a bland city in northern England , has actually seen an amazing transformation over the past few years . I have always loved Quayside and the great architecture of the city , plus the fabulous Baltic Centre For Contemporary Art which I visited several times when I lived in nearby Durham .

Gaudi 's dreamy architecture is seen throughout town , most notably his masterpiece , the unfinished Sagrada Familia cathedral and Park G++ell .

They hopped right up into the back of the pick-up and a man tied a metal chain through their collars and around the spare tire to hold them down . Although we imagined the worst , once we set off , they were smiling and howling , tongues wagging in the wind . <p> The farmers daughter sped like a bat out of hell around hills and along lakes that few non-locals probably ever get the chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small talk until we sped up to a dilapidated old semi-truck . <p> " When I drop you off , wait for him , " she said , barely slowing down to pass the truck .

" Were here .

How did the farmers daughter know they would stop at all ? <p> The white truck , the one in slightly better condition , did n't  even slow down as he passed ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no no , and our enthusiastic thumbs wilted . <p> One more chance , the powder blue truck lumbered up the road .

In that moment of feeling so totally exposed , I had a vision of an entire horse skeleton we once saw on the side of the road in Honduras and thought how we would look , laying on the side of the road , our skeleton arms looped through our faded backpacks <p> Suddenly , the truck stopped and started to back up . He had reconsidered and we ran toward him , so incredibly thankful to be out of the wind. - He tied our packs up outside on the empty truck bed and we hopped in the cab . <p> " You ladies would had been stuck out there , " he explained in his mumbled country Chilean accent and though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reserved. - I looked at a sticker on the passenger door and it said- the truck was Made in the USA , For Export Only , and I thought how , held up to an infrared light , you might find the same sign on me . <p> For over an hour we bounced in near silence until reaching the cross roads , where he headed south , staying in Chile , while we would head east toward Argentina with whoever would pick us up next . <p> This landscape was flat , nothing to stop the wind from gaining speed . As I peeled carrots to snack on , the wind blew the peels off into the distance . We ate inside the wind shelter , which reeked of urine and was covered in pithy quotes and graphic pictures .

He came off friendly at first , giving us a tour . He had a twin bed with colorful sheets wedged right behind the seats , a small fridge , microwave and cabinets , where he pulled the lollipops out of . <p> Despite referring to Dani constantly as his future wife , he served his purpose and we crossed through the Chilean border and onward to the official Argentine entry point . <h> Homeless at the end of our journey <p> We felt quite adventurous , but the border patrols indifference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize with a yawn and wave through , this happens here every day . <p> Happy to be away from our sleazy friend we now stuck our thumbs out again right in front of the border patrol , and a young Argentine in his late 20s picked us up right away. - Only 88 kilometers separated us now from Rio Grande , - a large yet unremarkable city with buses running every hour to Ushuaia and he sped so fast down the paved road that even Dani , my- pedal-to-the-metal German autobahn lover was gulping . <p> He dropped us off at an office where we bought tickets for the remaining three hours to the end of the world .

If just reading these questions has you pricing flights to tropical destinations , then you 're not alone . <p> Winter getaways to tropical hotspots are yearly occurrences for many people who love to travel and hate winter .

Visitors to the area can take advantage of car hire in Las Vegas to swap the city for the spectacular canyons . This is actually how we visited Hoover Dam and Lake Mead when we were in Vegas a few years ago ! <p> One easy day excursion , involving just a 30 mile trip to the southeast of Las Vegas , is to the- Hoover Dam . You can sense immediately what a monumental feat of construction and engineering it is , but taking the time to understand what went in to accomplishing this feat makes it that much more remarkable . Dating from the early 1930s , Hoover Dam borders Arizona and Nevada and impounds Lake Mead , the largest reservoir in the country . It is still considered the world 's biggest dam . Little wonder that it is a National Historic Landmark and a tourist attraction drawing almost a million visitors a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area had been around since the early 1900s , but three decades passed before the completion of the dam . Novel techniques for the time were employed and the project was fraught with difficulties , culminating in the cost of over a hundred lives . Despite this , the dam was completed ahead of schedule . <p> The dam was built primarily to control flooding while also providing a source of irrigation water . Today , the dam provides water for a population of around 8 million people and irrigates more than a million acres of land . But another reason for construction was to provide energy in the form of hydroelectric power , and it is this which generates the necessary proceeds to pay off the construction loan and maintain the dam . Hoover Dam became the largest hydroelectric power station in the world in 1939 , and more generators were added through to the 1960s . <p> But the dam is not just impressive in size and scope ; it is also a work of art . Graceful Art Deco designs adorn the towers and spillways , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptures and vast polished star map ' floor of the Nevada plaza .

Both tours take in the power plant , where visitors are taken hundreds of feet down through the rock , before viewing the huge pen-stock pipes , which transport 90,000 gallons of water a second ; afterwards , an elevator takes visitors back up for a sweeping view down to the power plant and generators . Visitors on the full tour also pass through the winding tunnels inside the dam . Numerous interactive exhibits explore the workings of the dam in detail . An observation deck in the visitor center allows for amazing panoramic views of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hoover Dam is set in a spectacular location and it is this of course , as much as the dam itself , which makes the trip so memorable .

You can also hike and camp in the area , enjoying the superb contrast of the lake and the surrounding desert . <p> Practical Information <p> Hoover Dam is open daily , except Thanksgiving and Christmas Day . Some parts of the dam are not accessible to those with wheelchairs or scooters , and the complete tour does not admit children under eight years .

Renting a car also allowed me to stop whenever I wanted , wherever I wanted . I just love the freedom you have when hiring a car , and with the low cost of rental cars these days , in most places it does n't make much of a difference if you rent a car or travel by public transportation . <p> Rental Car in Malta <p> I have to admit though that I find hiring a car in a foreign country still somewhat frightening " even though I 've rented cars in Malaysia , Italy , the UK , the US , Spain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always a fear factor involved , especially in countries that are known for their notorious drivers ( driving in Rome almost gave me a heart attack ) which is why I think car hire insurance is always a must , no matter where in the world you rent a car .

While car hire providers charge anything between $10 and $25 per day for extra insurance , specialist insurers offer the same kind of coverage for just $2 to $5 a day ! <p> Fiat 500 Rental Car Italy <p> Some credit card companies offer coverage for rental cars " check if one of your credit card providers includes car hire insurance . I ended up calling all my credit card companies once to find out which one included car hire insurance and booked the car with that card " which is an essential factor .

Some credit cards also only include the same basic coverage that the insurance already included by your rental provider offers " in this case , you should still look for an extra insurance covering things like Personal Accident Insurance , Liability Insurance or Personal Effects Coverage . <h> Best price on a rental <p> Use car rental comparison websites when researching the best rates . There are a bunch of those sites out there , and it does n't hurt to double-check the rates on several of them . Almost every time I hired a car , I reserved it through a car rental comparison website . I usually check if I can find the same rate directly on the provider 's website ( for example Hertz ) , but usually they only offer their special deals through these third-party websites . I have never had any problems booking through a third party though . <p> If you can , do n't hire a car at the airport .

Head to the interior for at least a day to discover its otherworldly landscapes . <p> Lanzarote is volcanic in origin and , as a result , boasts some weird and wonderful rock formations , as well as areas that look a lot like a lunar scene . The whole island is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve , which makes this a great vacation for eco-conscious travelers as development here remains sustainable as it grows . <p> Where to see Lanzarote 's lunar landscape <p> Timanfaya National Park is undoubtedly where you 'll find Lanzarote 's most spectacular and unusual scenery . The area has been shaped by volcanic eruptions , the most recent of which occurred in the 19th century , and due to the low levels of rainfall it receives the landscape has changed little over the years . <p> This means you can see the dried-up lava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eruptions . There 's also little plant life although the flora that does survive in the area is incredibly interesting offering up uninterrupted views of the volcanoes and the martian-style landscape that spreads out in front of you . <p> Independent travelers should note , though , that in order to visit this area , you must be part of a guided tour . This has its benefits in that your leader will be able to tell you more about Lanzarote 's fiery history , as well as show you some amazing tricks using the geothermal energy stored in the ground all things it would be hard to pick up on your own , anyway . <p> One of the most astounding things to see as you explore Timanfaya National Park is how the ground retains incredibly hot temperatures just beneath the surface . If you drop some dry twigs into a hole , they will instantly catch fire , while pouring water into a borehole will result in steam shooting out of the earth , much like a mini geyser . <p> This happens because just a few meters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 600 degrees C ! <p> To get a good overview of the landscape , head to the viewpoint at Montana Rajada .

The trail along the coast is one of the most fascinating , as this will allow you to see how Lanzarote 's shoreline has been shaped by the lava , which cooled and hardened upon hitting the sea creating all kinds of jagged and interesting rock formations . <p> These tours are absolutely free of charge , but you need to book two months in advance with a minimum of two people in your group .

I must admit that the first couple of times I visited New York I barely got to experience the city beyond its sights because I was trying to tick off as many as possible from my list : the MoMA , the Met , the Statue Of Liberty , the Brooklyn Bridge , the Guggenheim , the Empire State Building , the Flatiron Building , Central Park , Greenwich Village The list is endless . However , I realized that just focusing on the sights did n't  give me the chance to experience the city itself I left the city having seen the things New York is famous for but not knowing anything about how the city itself ticks . <p> Free views over the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan skyline <p> Luckily I have rectified this now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whenever I advise first time visitors on what to do on a visit to New York I make sure to recommend a good balance of attractions and city life / neighborhood exploration . <p> Of course you will want to visit New York attractions when you come to this amazing city but you should choose wisely which ones you really have to see . Read on for what I think are the sights worth paying for and which ones I think you should skip in favor for some meandering , people watching and street cafe relaxation : <p> Central Park a must-see in New York City ! <h> The Empire State Building vs the Top Of The Rocks <p> You should definitely do one of the two seeing New York from above is something truly special and well spent money . Now the question is : which one is better ? In my opinion , the Top Of The Rock is the better deal . Not only do you get to see the Empire State Building ( and it looks great in photos from above , does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park from up here , and seeing how giant New Yorks green lung actually is puts it in a completely new perspective . <p> Another advantage of Top Of The Rock ? Its the rooftop of the Rockefeller Center of course , home to NBC and 30 Rock ! Plus , since every tourist on the planet is obsessed with going on top of the Empire State Building , the lines there are much longer . Admission is the same now for both ( Top Of The Rock used to be cheaper ! ) at $29 per person . <p> View from the Top Of The Rocks <h> The museums Guggenheim vs Met vs MoMA <p> If you are a fan of modern art , the MoMA is a museum you should definitely NOT miss it is one of the top ten art museums in the world , if not even one of the top five ! - You can even visit the MoMA for free on Friday nights after 5pm but expect to tackle huge crowds . Either you visit another day and pay $25 admission which buys you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Friday night crowds . You can , however , get a better deal and skip the crowds with the multi-attraction passes I mention further on . <p> The Metropolitan Museum Of Art is another iconic art gallery in New York , focusing on the old masters and ancient exhibits , ranging from famous American painters to European masters like Vermeer , Monet and Van Gogh . There are some contemporary exhibits here , but in its core , the Met is the place to see the classics . There 's no free admission day/hours here , except for a few museum days every year ( check their website to find out when they take place ) . <p> The Sculpture Hall in the Met <p> The suggested admission is $25 , but you can pay as much as you want . Expect grumpy looks if you only put down five or ten bucks , but if that 's all you 've got , you can still go in and enjoy the museum . Trust me , you 're not the only one paying that little . <p> The Guggenheim is the third well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . If you are a modern art aficionado , you should visit either the Guggenheim or the MoMa while you 're in New York . Here you can pay what you wish on Saturdays between 5.45 and 7.45pm , normal admission is $22 . <p> Modern Art in the MoMA <h> The hop-on hop-off tours <p> If you ask me , you can skip them . Yes , you get to see a lot of the city while riding around in them , but you 'll be stuck in traffic a lot at least that 's my experience . And taking good photos while moving is nearly impossible . It is much better to walk in the city , especially Manhattan is very walkable . There are some great audio guide apps for self-guided walking tours which I highly recommend ! Safe the money for the hop-on hop-off bus and invest in a Broadway show instead . The TKTS ticket booth in Times Square offers discount tickets for all the major plays and musical every day for as little as $49 ( the same price of the hop-on hop-off bus ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you might want to skip : The Statue Of Liberty <p> The ferry out to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty has some of the longest waiting lines especially in the summer months . Now , if you 're a total history buff and are dying to visit the Ellis Island Immigration Museum to learn more about the European settlers who arrived in New York in the late 19th century , these lines might be worth the wait for you . If you , however , just want to catch a glimpse of the lady , you might just settle for the Staten Island Ferry , which does n't  stop at Liberty Island or Ellis Island but passes the Statue Of Liberty and is completely free . If you are planning to visit Liberty Island , note that you have to reserve a ticket in advance to be able to access the crown of the statue ( $21 incl ferry ) . A ticket without crown access is $18 . <p> The Statue Of Liberty <h> What to skip for sure : <p> Any of the attractions around Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend time in a wax museum ? If that 's your thing , sure go ahead , but you could do that in plenty of other cities as well . New York has way more awesome stuff to offer than Madame Tussauds or Ripleys Believe It Or Not . <p> Times Square : NYCs biggest tourist trap <h> The best way to save money on attractions : <p> Get a multiple attractions pass ! Most websites that offer these kind of deals let you choose between a 3-attractions or 5-attractions pass , and depending on how many sights you 're planning to hit up , you can choose what 's best for you . These passes are cheaper than paying each in sight individually , and often also include a hop-on hop-off bus ( if you get it for free , you might as well take it at least for some parts of your day ! ) . If you want to see New Yorks iconic museums and one of the rooftops plus Ellis Island , buying a multi-attraction pass is definitely the most economic choice . <p> A free not-to-be-missed attraction : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City ?

The only problem is everyone else knows this too ! Meaning that come summer , places like the Algarve can be extremely overpopulated with tourists . Something that can be extremely off-putting to other travellers . <p> However , you should n't let a few tourists keep you from experiencing one of Europe 's most treasured holiday destinations . With just a few clever tricks , I promise that you 'll be able to get the most out of your Algarve holiday without getting trampled on by stampedes of holiday-goers . <p> The Algarve itself is popular due to two main reasons " every year it experiences over 300 days of sunshine and yet it 's still an incredibly affordable destination with numerous budget flights . Then there 's the fact the region is famed for its long , clean beaches that are considered some of the safest in the world . It 's little wonder that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To avoid the crowds , I recommend avoiding the big hotels that occupy the central Algarve . Yes , the amazing hospitality , swimming pools and affordable hotel bills are very tempting . But that means everyone else will book too ! For more privacy , I suggest booking your own villa or apartment . Many of these private holiday homes have their own swimming pools meaning you wo n't have to share with other tourists , plus you can avoid the hectic morning buffets in favour of exploring the local food markets and attempting to make some Portuguese dishes yourself . <p> When it comes to beaches , both the south and central Algarve with beaches like Praia da Falesia are particularly busy due to all the facilities they provide . This beach resort has water sports , golf and even tennis for all ages , making it very popular with families . <p> For a quiet day on the beach opt for an area that has been less developed for tourists such as Praia Verde in the Eastern Algarve . Without a golf course or water park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dense pine forest and is home to an array of local birds and other wildlife to spot . There 's even a small boutique hotel hidden away in the forest called the Praia Verde Boutique Hotel . With just 40 suites , modern design and a delicious restaurant that offers seasonal dishes , there 's no doubt that this area will give you a taste of authentic Algarve life . <p> When it comes to eating out , the most popular restaurants are the western ones . Simply because they 've been built to suit the tastes of the thousands of tourists who visit each year . Instead , beat the crowds and experience some of the delicious Portuguese cuisine . After-all , you ca n't visit a country without trying its famous dishes . <p> For a taste of the best , the Michelin-starred S+o Gabriel- is a must-visit . The chef , accomplished local-born Leonel Pereira , undoubtedly creates some of the Algarve 's greatest dishes . Of course , being Michelin-starred the restaurant can be on the pricey side , however , there 's likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and offers a great experience . <p> If you 've got a sweeter tooth , Restaurant L14 , which is tucked away in the Salgados Dunas Suites hotel in Albufeira , won the Best Dessert 2015 award for its almond and fig dish . The restaurant offers a fusion of local and international foods , so it 's a great choice if you 're new to the cuisine . <p> All-in-all , it 's very possible to avoid the tourists in the Algarve , you just need to venture further afield from the popular resorts . If you do , you 'll quite possibly regard the Algarve as one of your top holiday destinations . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

You can buy cheap beer from the famous Sp+ti shops , which are on almost every street corner , then enjoy your beverages outside and unhindered by the authorities ( It 's legal to drink alcohol on the streets in Berlin ) . This means that you can experience more of the city on a budget.Today I wanted to share some of the cheap things I love doing in Berlin : <h> Free Art everywhere ! <p> Berlin is packed with art everywhere you look .

We have n't been there in many years but after reading this article , were ready to return to Prague and to explore neighborhoods and sights we have n't visited yet particularly focusing on Kafka , one of the most remarkable German-language writers of the 20th century . Our guest writer Olivia Herriot shares with us some of Pragues Kafkaesque sights . Olivia is based in the UK and spends her time juggling a part-time office job with freelance travel writing . She is currently planning a working trip around Russia . <p> Born in Prague , Austria-Hungary in 1883 , Franz Kafka went on to become one of the most influential authors of the 20th Century . His existentialist themes have inspired a number of great writers , from Camus to Borges , Jean-Paul Sartre to J.D. Salinger , and it 's pretty much impossible to talk about any dystopian literature without throwing around the term Kafkaesque ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best ways to understand the man behind the words is to tour the old haunts around his native Prague . <p> City breaks to Prague tend to follow a typical pattern : touring Old Town , marvelling at the beautiful cathedrals , walking around the Castle District and seeing an opera or symphony performance in the evening . However , if you 're in the mood for something a bit different for your Prague trip , a Kafkaesque tour of the city wo n't disappoint .

For further insight into Kafka 's life , visit the Old-New Synagogue where he had his bar mitzvah . Built in 1270 , the gothic structure is also the oldest active synagogue in Europe . <p> New Jewish Cemetery <p> Situated outside the tourist area of Prague , the New Jewish Cemetery is the site of Kafka 's final resting place . Whilst it 's possible to visit Kafka 's grave during any time of the year , the most popular time to pay respects is on 3 June , the anniversary of his death . <p> Tribute to Kafka <p> Wenceslas Square <p> Out of Prague 's main , central city squares , Wenceslas Square was where Kafka worked from 1906 to 1907 .

To understand the regional reach of Adelaide 's charm , though , you need to visit the Barossa Valley , one of Australia 's top wine regions and a place of historical significance for the first European settlers . <p> The Willows Winery by Dave Sag via Flickr.com <p> For the most convenient arrangements , find a hotel- in Adelaide ( Booking.com is my go-to hotel booking website ) and make day trips to the valley , which is only 60 kilometers northeast of city limits . The valley has four main country towns : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the joy in visiting Barossa , however , is found between those towns , in the spacious vineyards and farms that produce world-quality wines and other gourmet items . <h> Visiting the Wineries <p> No visit to Barossa Valley is complete without a look at the famous wineries in the region . Even if you 're not a wine-drinker , seeing the cultivation of grapes here first-hand is a fun day out . The vineyards were planted by German and Prussian settlers , who brought an appreciation for fine soil and quality wines with them from Europe . The area 's fertile dirt is one of the reasons the vineyards took off ; another is that the cool summer temperatures and high levels of precipitation in the winter make for ideal conditions when growing grapes for red wine . <p> Nowadays , such famous Australian wine labels as Penfolds , Wolf Blass , Yalumba and Peter Lehmann have their main vineyards in the Barossa Valley . The types of wines grown here include full-bodied shiraz varieties , cabernet sauvignon and grenache for reds and rieslings and Chardonnays for whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Barossa Valley , your trip through wine country can be as organized " or free-spirited " as you please . You might choose to drive along the country lanes stopping at whichever places strike your fancy or tailor your trip to particular tastes in your group by browsing through the online directory of winemakers and devising a route to take . <h> Sampling the Food <p> Do n't  expect to get by on wine alone in the Barossa region ; the area has many enticing local farms to draw from with your meals . Cheeses , meats and vegetables grown through sustainable farming practices will give you options to accompany your pursuit of the perfect wine . The local lamb is a must-try , served of course with locally made chutneys and fresh-grown herbs . <p> Most famous for food in the area might be the ventures of celebrity TV chef Maggie Beer and daughter Saskia Beer . Their Farm Shop in Nuriootpa offers picnic and sit-in lunches and cooking demonstrations . Or , if you prefer a DIY approach , pop into Angaston for to an Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farmer 's Market . <h> Trying Activities Other Than Food or Wine <p> The Barossa Valley is a foodie 's dream come true , but there are also activities in the area that will appeal to senses other than your taste . Welcome the morning sailing above the vineyards in a hot air balloon , or go for a bushwalk in the Kaiserstuhl Conservation Park . This is the best place to get a vista of the Barossa Valley ( other than from a balloon , that is ) and offers several kinds of landscapes . It 's only 12 kilometers from Tanunda and is open year-round . <h> Getting Around <p> If you 've hired a car for your visit to Adelaide , you 'll find the route to Barossa Valley well-marked and easy to follow : it 's most direct to take National Highway M20 from the airport to Tanunda . Alternatively , you can enjoy the country scenery by following National Highway A1 to Tanunda . This way will take you past the entrances to Para Wirra Recreation Park and the Mount Crawford Forest Reserve , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two Hands " Bee by Jono Haysom on Flickr.com <p> If you 'd like to leave the driving to others so that you can sample more vintages at the award-winning wineries in the region , you have that option too . Ask at your hotel about signing on for a coach trip to the valley , or take advantage of public transportation and go via bus or rail . Once in the valley , you can get from point to point by hired bicycle . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143351 @2543351/ <p> This year will go down in history as the year of the beach for the two of us ! <p> All those days in the office before we started traveling long-term , our thoughts would drift to what it would be like to live on the beach and wake up to the crashing of waves on the shore , the sound of seagulls and being barefoot through the sand . Well in 2012 we certainly got our wish in a year that saw us living over five months on the beach . We spend longer stints in Mexico and Costa Rica , and took trips to the sandy shores of Singapore , Malaysia , India and our number one spot that often gets overlooked by its- famous neighbor- Thailand . <p> Read on for our five favorite beach experiences of 2012 : <h> 5 . Varkala , India <p> While we did n't  see what all the hype was about on the beaches of Goa and Kerala , we did fall for the cliffs of Varkala , about an hour north of Trivandrum in the far south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily made up for by walking the paths along the gorgeous cliffs , looking out over the wide beaches below . There are plenty of hotels and restaurants for every travelers budget , and the sunsets here were breathtaking . <h> 4 . Samara , Costa Rica <p> Long-time readers will know that Samara has been a favorite beach of ours since we first ended up there on whim back in 2011 . This October we were lucky enough to return for a few days and were excited to find that this Costa Rican beach has n't  lost any of its charm . Although the waves of - Samara are perfect for newbie surfers , - the long stretch of sandy beach feels empty even in the high season , with restaurants and hotels well hidden behind the palm trees that line the shore . In a country so popular with international tourists , Samara is one of the few secret spots that combines a great selection of accommodation and relatively few tourists . <h> 3 . Langkawi , Malaysia <p> We had never even heard of Langkawi , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but somehow we found ourselves promising a Canadian expat we would go there when she so passionately insisted we visit the favorite part of her adopted country . We ended up spending a week there , and Cenang Beach was by far our favorite beach on the island . Powdery , soft white sand , clear and shallow water , palm trees and incredible sunsets . This is really the perfect vacation island for travelers from near and far . <h> 2 . Mahahual , Mexico <p> Odds are , you have never heard of Mahahual , unless maybe you have taken a short Caribbean cruise . A popular cruise port once or twice a week in high season , Mahahual- is otherwise a small , relaxed fishing town on the Yucatan peninsula with incredibly warm , turquoise water . This was the closest place from the remote beach house- we housesat this past summer , and we found every excuse to make the trip . Making sure not to be there on cruise ship day we would lay in the rows of empty sun chairs lined up along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer . Heaven on Earth ! <h> 1 . Otres Beach and Koh Rong , Cambodia <p> Cambodia takes the crown for our favorite beach in 2012 ! There are actually TWO beaches here that tie for first : Otres Beach , on the mainland , and Long Beach on the little known island of Koh Rong . Just a quick tuk-tuk ride from the popular beach town of Sihanoukville , a trip to Otres Beach means avoiding the touts selling tourist trinkets , and focusing on what is important : relaxing in your sun chair with a cool coconut , staring out at sea . The few restaurants and bars here are of better quality than in town and somehow it feels like the sunsets are , too ! <p> For those of you who are serious about your deserted beaches , - Koh Rongs Long Beach was an amazing experience . The small island two hours off the coast of Sihanoukville only has a handful of guest houses and not much to offer in the way of diversion , but with the seven mile stretch of crystal clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have cared less . We were particularly unimpressed with the side of the island where the port is and even considered leaving a day early , until we were told about a path that leads over to the other side of the island . It is an hour-long hike across an entirely untamed islands , which included much tripping , a bit of falling , profuse sweating , more swearing and a 75m descent straight down by clinging to a rope that mysteriously appears the minute you need it to finish the way down . Walking out into the clearest water we have ever seen , however , made the hike entirely worth it . Of course , we found out later you can rent a boat , round-trip , for $25 to take you and ten of your closest friends from the port on a 15-minute ride around to the otherwise deserted Long Beach . But we preferred working hard to reach our absolute favorite beach of 2012 ! <p> Now we want to know from you what is the best beach you visited in 2012 ? Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 15 Comments <p> Mahahual looks amazing ! I always look for beaches with white sand and calm , shallow water . Looks pretty perfect to me . Were thinking of going to Costa Rica next year so will be interesting to compare the Caribbean beaches to South East Asia . <p> I 'm so glad you 've rated your favourite beaches as its always something I look for when traveling or on holiday . Great scuba , great beaches , and great parties . Were heading to Vietnam and Cambodia in January so its great to hear about Otres Beach and Long Beach , well be sure to visit them both . <p> After traveling to Central America and the Caribbean for 9 months earlier this year I have to say my favourite beaches are those on Bocas Del Toro , an archipelago site off the coast of Panama . There are a few amazing , and very different beaches , depending on what island you go to . Red Frog Beach is the most popular , you have to take a water taxi and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6pm , the plus side is , it does n't  get too busy . Another favourite is Playa Bluff which on the main island ( Isla Colon ) which is an hour bike ride from Bocas Town and is usually completely deserted except for when there 's a surf competition . The waves are so big and powerful here we only went so far as having the water up to our knees . And finally the best of them all Zapatillas Beach , on a very small island which is totally uninhabited , apart from the turtles . It takes about 40 minutes by water taxi and you can walk around the whole island in about half an hour . This is the ultimate paradise which I think will be hard to beat ! <p> Hi Beth , thanks a lot for the recommendation ! We spent some time in Bocas in spring 2011 , but we did n't  have enough time to explore the further away beaches while we were there . We loved Red Frog Beach though ! Zapatillas Beach sounds amazing I hope well get the chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting some beach time in in 2013 ( 2012 has been woefully devoid of beaches for me ) , but from Africa instead of Asia and the Americas . Hopefully the beaches will be able to hold a flame to what you 've shared here ! <p> Yes we did n't  like any of the accommodation options on the island , but we loved that beach ! So secluded and just stunning .. We have n't been to Hawaii yet but keep reading about it on so many blogs that we are now dying to go ! = 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

We arrived in the most scenic way " via cable car " and headed straight to the beaches . We had no idea that Singapore even had such gorgeous beaches ! Sentosa Island is also the place where you find the southernmost spot on continental South East Asia , and you find enough entertainment here to keep you busy for a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World and a Dolphinarium , a Sky Tower and an Adventure Park , to name just a few . You can also get here on the MRT train and can get around the island by bus . <h> Kampong Glam <p> Sometimes called Muslim Quarter ' of Singapore due to its large Muslim population and number of mosques , this is by far our favorite neighborhood in Singapore . You can just get lost walking through the colorful renovated shop houses , have coffee in little tea houses , or window shop at the textile and silk shops on Arab Street . Sultan Mosque is the most impressive mosque in Singapore and should n't be missed ! <h> Marina Bay <p> Marina Bay is almost the complete opposite of Kampong Glam " the world 's leading financial institutions have their Singapore headquarters in skyscrapers around the bay , and the remarkable Marina Bay Sands Hotel with its one-of-a-kind rooftop infinity pool sits on the south side . Take a couple of hours to walk around the Bay , visit the city 's mascot , the Merlion statue , stop at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvel at the funky Art &amp;Science Museum , cross the Helix Bridge and enjoy the many modern statues along the way . The best way to see all of Marina Bay is actually from the rooftop of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel " we recommend heading up to 57th Floor Bar instead the observation deck . A drink will cost you less ( or the same , at $20 ) and the views are the same . When we go back , we 'd actually choose a Marina Bay Hotel in Singapore since it is in walking distance of most of downtown 's hot spots , including the popular Maxwell Hawker Food Center . <h> Chinatown <p> One thing we loved about Singapore were the many different ethnic neighborhoods " Kampong Glam for the distinctive Muslim vibe , Little India for amazing Indian food at small prices , and Chinatown for a mix of cheap restaurants ( here you 'll find the cheapest alcohol in all of Singapore ! ) , interesting Chinese medicine shops and other Chinese paraphernalia , and beautifully restored buildings , especially along- Pagoda Road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of brothels , 30-50 people stuffed into tiny apartments and drug abuse , the neighborhood is now among Singapore 's prettiest " especially at night , when the red lanterns on the streets are all lit up . <h> Haw Par Villa <p> Even though this place is kind of creepy , we thought it was a unique experience that you wo n't have anywhere else in the world ! Plus , it 's free ! Haw Par Villa was built in 1973 by the millionaire brothers who founded the popular Tiger Balm brand . The villa and its gardens feature over 1,000 statues which all depict scenes of Chinese history and mythology " which can be rather strange , like the old man milking on a woman 's breast or rats with bleeding stumps , armed monkeys and the 10 Courts Of Hell . For anyone who is n't familiar with Chinese mythology and folklore , these scenes might be confusing , but believe us , it 's also something you will never forget ! <p> Have you been to Singapore ?

We are already planning where we want to take them on family vacations with us ! <p> A major challenge for that is the packing aspect two minimalist digital nomads have a very different packing list to a family with children . If we do decide to take our nieces on a trip this summer , a travel checklist is absolutely essential for a smooth trip preparation we would hate to leave anything behind , be it something critical or a special toy or plaything that the girls will miss during the trip . <p> Below is a list of what we would include when packing for a family holiday this summer . <p> Documentation <p> The first thing you should make sure you pack is your documentation .

Whether the weather forecast is for sun or clouds , make sure to bring enough to put on the kids if you 're spending time outside in the fresh air on holiday . <h> Snacks <p> I know even as adults Dani and I get hangry ( hungry-angry ) whenever we wait too long to eat , but when traveling with kids even a small amount of h-anger can turn into a nightmare ! Bring snacks from home not only to lower the risk of getting hungry and losing energy , but also to have a back-up plan for familiar food from home , in case the food on vacation proves a bit too foreign for the kids . <h> Insect Repellent <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malaria or dengue , insect repellent can be an utter lifesaver in a less literal sense as well who wants to spend their trip scratching away ? On a family holiday , you want to be able to enjoy the outdoors without worrying about bites , so insect repellent is the best and easiest way to prevent mosquito attacks . <p> Entertainment <p> As much as taking in beautiful scenery is a big part of what holidays are all about , the stimulation of being in a new place can be a lot on the kids and the parents as well ! Every family needs a couple of chill out evenings , so make sure to bring books , magazines , crafts and possibly DVDs or an iPad along for the trip in order to let every one enjoy some down time , too . <h> First Aid Kit <p> Activity holidays like hiking or kayaking are fun , but can leave you vulnerable to scratches and scrapes .

Visit Wales have some fantastic suggestions on accredited family activity holidays , so you can take your kids away and minimize the hazards , but all parents know that you cant predict and prevent injury all the time , so its best to be prepared . <h> Ear Plugs <p> This last one might be more for you than for the kids , but at the end of a long day , you need your sleep as well . Because you cant predict the kind of ambient noise there will be where you are staying , bring along a pair of ear plugs in order to block out the noise so you can get your shut eye to be refreshed and ready to tackle a new day of vacation with the kids . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335

According to the address and the map , the Chill Out Flat B&amp;B had to be there somewhere , but where would the cozy little bed and breakfast we saw online be hiding amongst some of Mexicos grandest historical buildings , we wondered . <p> A female security guard in front of what appeared to be an office building watched us pass by , but gave me a knowing look when I caught her eye . When we wandered by a second time a few minutes later , I climbed the steps to ask her what I thought was a ridiculous question , about a little hotel . Before a word left my mouth she smiled and said in her Spanish accent Chillout ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chillout , we said happily . This way , she said , pointing us to the elevator in the back of the building . 1st floor . <p> It was then that a few words on a screen buried deep in my memory wiggled its way into my mind . Ahyescomplicated directions in the confirmation email . I meant to have those up on my iPhone . <p> The building itself is a six-story building , with apartments and businesses spread throughout . Once we arrived on the first floor , we entered a patio surrounded by closed , private apartment doors . Sure this had to be wrong or the start of some strange adventure , one quick glance to the right down a short hallway revealed a sign , in colorful stick-on block letters : CHILL OUT FLAT B&amp;B . Seconds later we were embraced by a ray of sunshine , Eloisa , who owns and operates the place with her partner David . <p> Despite being in the middle of cleaning , a mop in her gloved hands , she could n't have been more friendly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes before rushing off to make our room ready . <p> If the Chill Out felt as comfortable as staying in a private home , its because that is essentially what it is . Davids mother bought the apartment years before the city centers renovations , against warnings from friends and family about what was then an undesirable neighborhood . Thanks to her foresight , twenty five years later , she has let David and Eloisa run the B&amp;Bl while she lives in a much more comfortable spot in Mexico Citys high-end suburbs . The living room is comfortable with two small couches around a coffee table filled with guide books , maps , flyers and pamphlets , plus a TV , DVD player and computer with internet access in the corner . The fully-stocked kitchen is available 24 hours a day to guests , so we immediately made ourselves each a cup of green tea and set about planning our afternoon in Mexico City while we waited for our room to get ready . Within minutes , the Chillout felt like home . <p> We do n't  meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing and working at one of the kitchen tables . He popped over from the apartment across the hall where they now live . David could not be more friendly , and we talked travel for ages . A flight attendant for a few years , including the first year or so when he launched the bed and breakfast , David finally quit serving drinks at 35,000 feet when the B&amp;B took off thanks , in part , to the hundreds of five star reviews on Tripadvisor . Today , they have taken their success to the second floor of the same building , where they have opened a Chillout Yoga Studio . <p> There are six rooms here , so the feeling is incredibly intimate . Ours is outside the main apartment , with a separate entrance . The en-suite room is small and simple . Immaculately clean with a comfortable Queen bed , a bedside table and lamp , dresser and colorful Mexican paintings on the wall . It could be a room in anyones house , except that extra bit more comfortable which , along with warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and breakfast . <h> Stand Out Feature : Community in the Kitchen <p> Every morning from Monday to Saturday , Eloisa prepares a full Mexican breakfast for guests . Unfortunately we are only there on Sunday , but in a way this gave us some great insight . Even on her one day off , the kitchen is fully stocked with homemade yogurt , fresh fruit , breads and jams , coffee , tea , a kettle , water and other little snacks available until 10pm . The kitchen is roomy , with three tables and unlike other B&amp;Bs where the kitchen feels off-limits , the sense of community feels almost like a hostel , though the cleanliness , quality and privacy are definitely several levels up from that . <h> Stand Out Feature : Location <p> Normally we try to avoid choosing a feature that owners have so little control over , but it would be a mistake not to at least emphasize how incredible the location of the Chill Out Flat B&amp;B is . A ten minute walk from the Zocalo , and we can see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours of exploring the city center , we hopped back upstairs and just had a quick lie down , maybe 30 minutes or so , before heading back out to find the famous Mexico City bakery and have a drink at a popular nearby restaurant .

At 6am the next morning we snuck out and walked five minutes to the airport bus . Staying at the Chillout is like having an extremely well-connected friend with a coveted downtown apartment . <h> Room for Improvement : Being picky Sticky locks <p> Magnified by being placed in this section , the issue of the lock is a small detail , it is just the only issue we had , so it bears mention here. - The lock to the main apartment is old , sticky and complicated to open .

@@107143367 @2543367/ <h> How to keep your romance alive while traveling <p> When traveling long term as a couple , it can be difficult to keep the romance alive . Heck , even on a two or three week backpacking trip with my partner I sometimes found it difficult to keep the flame burning . Especially on long travel days with delays or things not going as planned bickering is almost unavoidable . Budget accommodation can make it hard to feel romantic , and spending 24/7 with your partner can be exhausting ( yes , I 've said it ) . To make sure your relationship survives a trip together , here are my top five tips to keep the romance alive while traveling : <h> 1 Make time for romance <p> No matter if that 's a dinner date , a bottle of wine shared while watching the sunset on a beach , or cuddling up with a movie in bed its important to make time for romantic things on a trip . Otherwise , it can easily feel like you 're traveling with a buddy , not with your significant other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sightseeing , planning the next few days , booking accommodation and making travel arrangements ( especially on long term trips ) and maybe checking in with family and friends back home ( or like in my case : checking work emails ) . How many times have I found myself at the end of the day just ready to crash , unable to even entertain the thought of getting it on . That 's why it is important to plan in time for romance from the get-go otherwise quality time with your partner will get the short end of the stick . <h> 2 Celebrate special occasions <p> Make sure to celebrate special occasions on your trip your birthday , your partners birthday , your anniversary : do n't  let these events slip or say This trip is already our celebration ! If its your partners birthday , seek out a swanky restaurant in the city you 're in and surprise him or her with a candle light dinner . Even better : order flowers ! Luckily , its easy enough these days to find flower delivery services online these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melbourne or in Mexico City . And it does n't  have to be a birthday do n't  forget about Valentines Day just because you 're traveling , or a special date you share . <h> 3 Factor in the occasional splurge <p> This goes especially for long term travelers : you probably saved up for this trip for a really long time , and on a budget backpacking trip $50 can go a long way . Do , however , plan in the occasional splurge and do n't  become super stingy with your money . Its easy to get into this mindset of having to live on $50 or less a day to make your trip last as long as possible but at what price ? Treating yourself to a nice hotel every now and so often will not only do wonders for your relationship ( it sure is n't easy to get romantic in a cheapie room with an uncomfortable bed ) but also for your sanity . Remind yourself that you are n't  actually poor .. just frugal . I cant tell you how quickly I get my sexy back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big , comfy bed with fresh crisp sheets . <h> 4 Give yourself personal space <p> That 's a big one : All of a sudden you and your partner are spending 24/7 together ! Think about your daily lives together even if you live together , how much time do you really spend together ? Probably not much between a 9-to-5 , social obligations and work out sessions or other hobbies you pursue . I remember that before my partner and I left on our round-the-world trip together , I usually got home around 8 and was in bed by midnight . That 's barely four hours a day except for weekends and all of a sudden , I had to spend every waking hour with my partner ! The loss of me time and personal space will not go unnoticed in 95% of relationships , and I recommend planning separate activities regularly . For me , these can be photography walks , morning runs or simply enjoying a cup of coffee while journaling by myself . Doing things separately also gives you something to talk about when you reunite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget to laugh <p> As I mentioned above : There will be times that are frustrating , that 's just unavoidable . Delayed trains , a 12-hour bus ride in an uncomfortable seat ( or , if you 're really unlucky , next to the toilet .. ) , the search for something to eat when you 're already beyond starving . Therell be moments that will test your patience and moments when you get annoyed by something your partner says or does . In moments like that , do n't  forget to laugh . I remember traveling with my partner in Thailand when it was impossible for me to find a place with decent wifi on the tiny island we were on and I felt how I became increasingly bitchy towards her , which in turn agitated her , and there we were , on a paradise island , bickering , instead of feeling lucky to be in such a gorgeous place . At some point , I luckily caught myself doing it and reminded myself that this was an annoyance beyond our control . I looked at her and started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend the day on the beach instead of continuing this frustrating search for wifi . Here are some other unconventional tips on how to end an argument . <p> So no matter how short or long your trip is , make an effort to keep the romance alive , and your trip will be much more memorable for both of you . <p> Do you have any tips on how to keep the romance alive while traveling ?

There are lots of street cafes where you can sit down and watch the world go by while having a delicious cappuccino . Check out the self-guided coffee walk I recommend in this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get it , not everyone loves walking as much as I do . If you prefer a tour , then the Melbourne City Tourist Shuttle is perfect for you .

Luckily there are several rooftop bars with splendid vistas , such as the aptly named Rooftop Bar , Naked in the Sky , or Madame Brussels .

Peer-to-peer rentals rely on customer reviews , after all , and you want to make sure to get the best rating possible for your place splendid reviews are what attracts guests more than anything else ! <p> My top tip : Always go the extra mile . And by that I do n't  mean you have to go over the top with what you provide your guests with , but a small gesture like a kettle in the room or simply a snack box on the table with some sweets will make you stand out and makes it more likely that your renters will give you a 5-star rating and recommend you to their friends and family . <p> If you are thinking about listing your spare room on Airbnb or a similar site , make sure you are aware of all risks involved , of things like taxes and insurances , safety and handling payments .

@@107143372 @2543372/ <h> FlightCar : A win-win for travelers <p> I absolutely love the concept of the sharing economy . No matter if it is meal sharing , where locals invite you in their home for a home-cooked meal , or AirBnB , where locals rent out their apartment when they 're traveling ( or a spare room , which is what I used to do in my London apartment long before airbnb became big ) , touring a city with a local thanks to websites like WithLocals , where locals can play tour guides or offer other cool activities .

Not only do you save money on airport parking , but you actually earn money from people who rent you 're car while you 're gone . And even if nobody rents your car : you still get free airport parking and a free car cleaning ! If you do n't  need your car for a longer period because you 're out of the country or are a couple who can make due with one car for a while , you can make up to an extra $500 a month the guaranteed monthly payout is between $200 and $500 , depending on age , model and size of the car , no matter if the car is rented or not .

Its a win-win for both , the renter and the car owner.If you have a car and leave it at the airport with FlightCar , but travel to another city where FlightCar operates : even better . Someone else can use your car while you 're gone , and you are able to use another persons car while visiting their city , benefiting another car owner instead of a large corporation ( which is exactly the reason why I love the peer-to-peer concept of AirBnB or WithLocals ! ) . <h> My FlightCar experience <p> I was a bit skeptical at first about the condition the car would be in when I signed up and booked my first car with FlightCar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest size ( I am not great at parking , so the smaller the car , the better for me ) , which is also the cheapest option .

@@107143375 @2543375/ <h> How to Handle Long Layovers <p> Most people tend to avoid booking flights with long layovers , as this is valuable time that could be spent on your vacation . Non-stop flights tend to be much more expensive , though , and for long-distance journeys they may not even be an option.Not only could you save money this way , but you could also spend the time exploring a city that you 've never visited before or grabbing some bargains from the duty-free shopping malls . Here 's how to make the most of your time during a long layover . <h> Heading into the City <p> If you have enough time , you should consider heading into the city . Even if you 've never considered visiting it beforehand , you might be surprised what you find and it may even turn out to be a place that you want to arrange a longer trip to in the future . Depending on where you 're staying , you may need six or more hours to comfortably explore the city while giving yourself enough time to catch your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most popular layover destinations in Europe , located just five miles from the main city itself . This handy guide from CitizenM locates all the nearby attractions . However , if you decide to do this , you should prepare for it beforehand . Not only do different countries all have different visa restrictions , but depending on your flight itinerary you may also need to give yourself an extra hour to grab your second boarding pass . <h> Duty-Free Shopping <p> If you do n't have the time to leave the airport , you may want to consider which duty-free shopping stores are available . This can be a great way to save money on certain items . Make sure to research your own country 's duty-free exemption laws before you decide to stock up , though , as these can vary wildly.For instance , in the UK , travellers are allowed to bring an unlimited amount of most goods with them as long as they were bought in another EU country , whereas you 'll be limited to -390 in other overseas locations . Similarly , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchandise back . In both countries , however , numerous exceptions still apply , especially when it comes to goods like alcohol and cigarettes . <h> Checking into a Hotel <p> Finally , if you 've just been on a long and particularly uncomfortable flight , it 's not surprising that you may not be feeling up for either of these options . If this is the case , consider checking into a nearby hotel and taking a short nap before your next flight . You 'll find that most major airports have several options nearby , as people catching early flights often prefer to stay the following night to ensure that they do n't miss their trip.You can use the Maps app included on your smartphone to check what hotels are close by and sites like lastminute.com to see if there are any cheap rooms available at the time . Occasionally , airports also include pay-per-access lounges where you can sleep , but these may be more expensive than your other options . 129332 @qwx989332 129335 @qwx989335 
@@107143376 @2543376/ <h> Polaroid of the week : Floating in the Dead Sea <p> I spent most of the last week road tripping around Israel , crossing the country from the Lebanese border in the north to the far south , where I saw both the Egyptian and the Jordanian borders on my morning runs through Eilat , Israels Red Sea resort town . This road trip came with so many highlights it was hard to pick one single moment for this weeks Polaroid ! I loved the blue grottoes of Rosh Hanikra which are right on the border to Lebanon , the ancient fishing village of Akko and the spectacular- Bah++ Gardens in Haifa . From there , my friend and I made our way south to the Dead Sea , where I hiked up the Masada , an ancient fortification located on top of an isolated rock plateau , with stunning views over the Dead Sea ( I hiked up there at 5.30am to see the sunrise over the Dead Sea ) , climbed up to the waterfalls of Ein Gedi , a desert oasis , and finally returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a desert area with unusual red rock and stone formations that blew me away ( and nearly killed me , thanks to the 100-F/37-C temperatures ) . I loved my time in Eilat , where I snorkeled on the coral reef that is closer to the beach than any other reef Ive been to , and the many colorful fish I saw made me wish I 'd bought the underwater camera I was eying with this past summer in New York . After that , the road trip came full circle when we drove back north via Mitzpe Ramon , where I got to see the giant crater ( 25 miles long and up to 6 miles wide ) and stopped in Tel Aviv for a dose of big city life before returning to northern Israel for a typical Rosh Hashana ( Jewish New Year ) family dinner . I must have taken around 2,000 photos on the road trip alone and cant wait to show you all of Israels natural beauty . <p> The most unusual stop on the road trip was without a doubt the Dead Sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly an incredible and unforgettable experience . The Dead Sea , 1,401- ft/427m below sea level , is one of the most fascinating places in the world . I did n't  think I 'd be floating that much , but I could n't get my feet on the ground at all ! Which was n't a bad thing after all , because I learned that the Dead Sea is 1,004ft/306m deep , and deep bodies of water freak me out ( which is why I do n't  think I 'll ever try diving ) . With 34% salinity it is n't just one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world , it is also ten times saltier than the ocean . Tip : Do n't  rub your eyes ! ! ( I learned that the hard way . ) It is impossible for anything , animal or plant , to survive there . The landscape around the Dead Sea is very barren as a result , but oddly beautiful . Even though nature is basically dead in and around the Dead Sea , it is filled with healing minerals and hugely popular for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases to osteoporosis and arthritis . My skin felt amazing after my bath in the Dead Sea and the mud mask I gave myself there . Sadly , the countries bordering the Dead Sea ( Jordan and Israel ) have caused a lot of environmental damage , causing it to shrink rapidly . There are plans to replenish it , an initiative especially driven by Jordan . I hope that both Israel and Jordan will work together on this project , to guarantee the conservation of this unique natural wonder for future generations . 129334 @qwx989334 129336 @qwx989336 <h> 12 Comments <p> I loved the Dead Sea , it is such a cool experience .

But to be honest , not one of the cities we visited blew us away until we arrived in Singapore . Here , we finally tapped into that buzz we love great food , walking for miles and miles exploring the vibrant neighborhoods , the eclectic mix of Hindu , Chinese and Malaysian cultures and of course , the stunning architecture . <p> The city , which has been changing rapidly over the last 30 years , surprised us with creative architecture in many places , and Marina Bay was one of our favorite places .

@@107143380 @2543380/ <h> Hotel Tip of the Week : Le Gite del Sol in San Cristobal de las Casas , Mexico <p> Welcome to our weekly series Hotel Tip Of The Week . Being on the road every day of the year means we stay at countless hotels along the way . For all the dingy , disappointing budget digs , there are as many budget accommodation gems . We post one hotel tip of the week , every week , of places we feel confident recommending after having tried and tested them ourselves . <p> After a long and hectic night bus ride , all we wanted was to when we arrived at 7am in San Cristobal de las Casas , Mexico was to check in immediately at Le Gite del Sol , where we had made reservations . Based on previous budget hotel experience , we figured this was n't possible and pulled up a park bench to wait a few hours . Had we known how friendly and accommodating the French-Canadian/Mexican owners were , we would have made our way their immediately , as Le Gite del Sol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came across that made us feel like a valued guest in the way a boutique hotel or B&amp;B does . <p> Eventually we lugged our packs down the 5 hilly blocks to the hotel , whose location is just far enough out for the street to be relatively quiet . Le Gite del Sol , which means Bed &amp; Breakfast of the Sun in a mix of French and Spanish just like the couple who run it , is more of a split between a B&amp;B in one building and a budget hotel in the second building just four houses up across the street . The main house offers big en-suite rooms , a shared kitchen and a sunny patio space where all guests eat breakfast . The second building , where our room was , has smaller , bare bones budget rooms with shared bathrooms . <p> While the difference in quality was palpable , both buildings were spotlessly clean ( cleaning staff is on hand all day throughout both properties ) , and over on our side we had no issue at all with the shared bathrooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single and double en-suite rooms ( for $20 and $26 respectively ) are certainly a step or two above the other house . The cheaper rooms in the second house are basic . Each room has a bed , a desk , a closet and a window which opens to the hallway . The rooms are small , lack good ventilation , but they are cleaned every day by the diligent staff . Doubles cost $16 , singles $13 . For that price , you get breakfast included ( see below in Stand Out Features ) , a free wi-fi connection that always works , and the kitchen in the second house is big and invites you to cook a meal with fresh ingredients from the market , with 6 tables , a computer with free internet , plenty of space to work , read , cook and hang out . Water is free , as well , and if some sloppy guests do n't clean up , the kitchen is kept clean anyway by staff . <p> The Mexican woman owner is a no-nonsense boss who is friendly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you like your coffee in the morning and conversations had in passing about where guests have just been and where they are off to next . Her French-Canadian husband and partner is the perfect ying to her yang . He genuinely wants you to enjoy your stay and you get the feeling that he was a long-term traveller himself and wants to make sure that you have the kind of experience at his hotel that is so often lacking on our travels . <p> Le Gite del Sol is also an authorized booking agent for tours and buses . The prices were exactly the same as in the offices in town , and they gave you honest answers to questions about quality of tours or buses , leaving you feeling well-informed . <h> Stand Out Feature : Breakfast <p> Breakfast is included in the price and served every morning on the patio in the main building . You get a choice of eggs and toast , just toast , or cereal . Although the breakfast does n't fill you up until dinner , it is good comfort food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the norm at many budget places in Mexico . <h> Stand Out Feature : The " above and beyond " factor <p> We had to catch a very early bus our last morning along with three other hotel guests , and would have missed breakfast , but the owners woke up and served us all breakfast at 6am so that we would leave with full stomachs . They could have easily left us hungry , but offered us this and it was greatly appreciated . This was something we have not had before or since that stay at Le Gite Del Sol . Throughout our stay at Le Gite del Sol we felt this above-and-beyond factor at work , the extra explanations , the ease of booking with them , the little extra tips on what to see and do in town made us feel like special guests . <h> Room for improvement : The Rooms <p> The cheaper rooms in the second house lack decoration and could have more heart to them . They are definitely small , though not cramped , and need a bit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico for $13 ( single ) or $16 a double , plus breakfast and that personal touch , it is hard to complain about the rooms . <h> Overall <p> Le Gite del Sol will make your time in San Cristolbal de las Casas an enjoyable one . Though it is no frills it is equally no frustrations , as this hostel is B&amp;B-minded with their guests at heart . <p> Thanks for this post . I recently discovered your blog and I love the detail that you provide in your posts , which I find really helpful and inspiring . Question , did you find Mexico relatively safe to travel ? The reason why I ask is that I 'm reading lots of articles about the crime in the country . I 'm planning an extended trip next year and I was going to bypass Mexico altogether . <p> Marina ! Definitely do n't  bypass Mexico ! ! ! Mexico was our favorite country this past year , by a long shot . The country is so rich and diverse and fascinating . It is also very large . The crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily bad guy on bad guy crime . Think about Chicago , where I am from . Had the highest murder rate some years back , a statistic which did n't  make tourism numbers drop in the least . Not to downplay the rampant murders and violence , that is a factor , but the media have been portraying the country in such a negative light , its important that we travelers get there and get the word out about what a great place it is ! Read this post of ours , and then please feel free to have a look around our site at some Mexico posts . We can give you some advice on places to visit , for sure ! LONG ... <p> Just finished reading the posts I 'm going ! I will continue to read your Mexico info and start planning . And thanks for the tip on Zipolitethis is the kind of place that I like .. I 'd like to practice yoga as much as I can throughout my travels . 129332 @qwx989332 129335
