We 're working on implementing a setting in an upcoming TextNow update that will allow you to set the rings on your end .

I have the voicemail ticked ( turned on ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct account . I logged out and back in of my TextNow account and no luck receiving voicemails from my callers . Also , tried wifi and data w/o success . Any idea how to fix this ? <p> Hi Al . The best place to start on this one is to check for any available TextNow updates from within the Playstore , as this will likely address the voicemail quirks you 've mentioned and also add exciting new features as well . <p> If you 're all up to date , just shoot me an email at orders@TextNow.com and we 'll be happy to get to the bottom of this for you . <p> where do the voicemails show up in the phones storage. ? I ask because when I set my ringtone for notifications or anything , the voicemails I receive show up as a choice to select . that 's not s big deal , but there are voicemails that are saved taking up space on my phone that I would like to delete . where and/or how do i delete the voicemails that are saved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( not sure if/when you reply to my comment if I get a notification . if I do cool . if I do n't , please email me the answer/reply to my comment. ) thank you ! <p> Thanks for contacting TextNow Support , and I 'm very sorry for the late reply ! <p> Your voicemails are kept on our TextNow servers until it 's played , at which point they 're downloaded to your device . Where they get downloaded will differ from phone to phone , but on my Samsung phone it 's under the Audio section in the My Files application . <p> That 's a great question , and I 'm afraid that we do not currently support uploads of custom files for our voicemail greetings . You may only record the greeting straight through the app ( on an iOs or Android ) . <p> Please let us know if you have any further questions , and/or concerns . <p> I am having problems listening to my voicemails . For instance , every time It shows I have a vm and I click on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My screen goes away like its going to go a screen that 's going to actually play it but it just goes right back to all my messages . I do n't  know what else to do . Help please . Thank you !

We are working on a partnership with a Canadian carrier to be able to offer you our service , just like we currently do in the US . <p> If the coverage in your area is " Off Network Roaming " then it will likely not work for you .

The caveat is that you wo n't be able to use your TextNow service outside of the US other than on Wi-Fi for this same reason .

We are always looking for ways to improve our service , and rest assured we pass along all of our customer feedback . <p> To answer your second question , we do not officially support hot-spotting . That being said , it is a feature we would be more than happy to enable for you however , please keep in mind since we do not officially support it we can not guarantee it will work .

I do not understand how that can be . When I am not tethered to my wifi at home and am traveling , my phone will not work automatically switching to 3G or even 2G unless I shut off WIFI. <h> 4 comments <p> 0 <p> Your phone will automaticly switch to cellular data if it is not connected to a WiFi network . TextNow relies mostly on data for all of its operations as it is a voip service . Every time you make or receive a call or text it adds up to your data usage . If you are without WiFi most of the time you may want to consider upgrading your plan . <p> That does sound like odd behaviour . Sometimes the culprit can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wifi , and tap on the wifi network you 're connected to , and it should say " connected " . ( Usually that 's the first one listed ) . The info box that pops up when you tap on the connection should have an IP address listed . <p> If it does n't say " connected " , or if it does n't have an IP address , your phone is seeing the wifi network but is n't actually connected . Click " Forget " and then Resync or Scan to reconnect to your wifi , which will probably ask you to reenter the password . <p> That 's a great question . The premium subscription that you currently have is only meant to grant you with features such as no ads , number locking , call forwarding , etc .

I normally get 6-7 days out of my tablet while idle without charging . I took a look around in Battery Consumption 's to see that 60% of my battery drain was TextNow ... The program was n't used at all on the tablet that day and only on my phone ... This kind of problem maybe a deterrent for many people as they do n't want an app that causes so much battery consumption ... <p> However , I just purchased the year subscription to lock my number and get rid of the advertising ... This worked immediately on the device that I used to do the purchase , but the other devices did n't update that setting until after I force closed the app and reloaded it . <p> Today Battery usage is about what I 'd expect for an app like this , having maybe a 7-10% impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... When advertising is enabled the device uses quite a bit more data and drains the battery even when the app is n't active ( on screen vs background ) . <p> I recommend you change your advertising engine or disable the engine when the program is in the background ... Then wait for the foreground event to reactivate the engine ... <p> You may want to skip the advertising engine and go directly with creating limitations .... 500 Minutes/Mo , 1000 Text Messages/Mo , etc ... These engines greatly bloat the size of the program , memory usage and battery life . People are n't going to stick around and pay money for a program that eats their battery . Especially if they do n't know that making the purchase to get rid of the ads will fix the battery life problem . They will see what I saw and uninstall it . <p> You guys need to do some of your own testing on this ... Keep in mind that you need to give it a day ... The first day I had TextNow , it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the engine needs a day to stack up on cached advertising to present to the user .

@@12302500 @902500/ <h> Community <h> Post <h> LG Tribute sucking up internal storage <p> My phone has 4GB internal storage . Over half of it is taken up by " System Data " in the Misc files of the storage ( 2.51GB ) . At first I did n't have too many problems . I had an SD card which allowed me to take a small amount of storage off of the internal storage . It was enough that I could function as long as I was very selective about what apps I had on the phone . At some point in the process , the phone stopped working when the SD card was in . The screen would stop responding within seconds of unlocking the screen and then I would turn the screen off and back on again and it would respond to any touch . I took the SD card and the phone responded just fine . So I 've been going without the SD card for a few months now . I 've had to be VERY particular about my apps and in order to keep most things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apps in the factory version setting with the updates uninstalled . But now in the past week the internal storage keeps getting sucked up . I can uninstall apps or updates but that only gets me back to maybe 50MB of available storage and when I go back into the storage a few hours later I 'm back to having no available storage and it 's not because of the cache either . I 'm seeing online that a lot of people are having storage problems with LG Tributes . I also see that that phone is no longer listed on here maybe this is why ? Should I go re-activate my Samsung Google Nexus ? I got the new phone because that one started working really slowly and I got fed up with it . Any ideas ? <h> 3 comments <p> 0 <p> Hi , Jemila : @qwx184682 <p> A possible solution would be to factory reset the phone to completely clear out any downloaded data or app updates , and then disable the apps you 're not using through the Apps section of your Settings menu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , if you wish .

You can send thousands of texts with 1Mb of data and 1 minute of calling will use approximately 0.3Mb of data . Using other apps ( Facebook , Twitter , Netflix , etc ) will use data when you are not on WiFi as well , so you should be cautious about how much data it uses as it could case you to exceed your plan limit . You can also restrict the data usage of those Apps by doing the following : <p> Every smartphone has apps . Apps are the programs that run on the phone , many of which come with the phone when you purchase it .

Getting kinda tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your connection , it 's very hard to determine what the problems are . That 's why I suggested looking at the Data Usage monitor , as it can give us some information as to what apps are using data when you 're not connected to wifi . <p> Our phones require a data connection to work . In the large majority of cases where data is being used off of wifi , the culprit either tends to be a dropped wifi connection , or apps running in the background using data when wifi is n't available . <p> In order to determine what 's going on with your particular phone and connection , we very much require your patience and cooperation .

@@12302528 @902528/ <h> Community <h> Post <h> EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE WRONG WITH THIS PHONE ! ! <p> I brought the S3 refurbished . It worked great for the first week or so and then all hell broke loose ! My phone would ring and ring but the calls would n't show up on my phone . Sometimes I would ignore calls and the screen will go black and continue to ring . I would try to turn it down open and reclose the phone but no luck . IT JUST KEEPS RINGING ! I woudl n't get text until hours after it was sent . I ca n't get videos and receiving or sending pictures are a hit or miss . A lot of times I have to try calling someone several times for the call to go through . Textnow hangs up my calls for no reason at all . My apps crash constantly , especially the Textnow app . Sometimes text will show in my notifications but not in the textnow messenger app . The service is ALWAYS bad and I am in Bowie , MD where Sprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its great because I had an iphone 5c serviced by Sprint and I did n't have these problems that I do now have with Textnow . And on top of all this the charger port stops working ! When my phone would n't charge I did n't know that right away . So I tried replacing chargers .. did that 5 times . I just could n't anymore it just started charging slower and slower and dying faster and faster . So I finally called TextNow Support . Wonderful customer service by the way ! ( Only thing that blows is that you 're not available 24/7 . And when I need to call you guys to figure out why my phone is not allowing me to make calls or send text , which by the way happens just about every other day for HOURS at a time , it wo n't even let me contact you either ! ) I told TextNow Support about my on going issue . They completely understood and decided to send me a new battery . So about a day or so later I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a couple hours ! I try charging the phone and it 's just not charging . No matter how I wrap the cord or try to hold it into place , nothing is doing the trick . Its too late to call Textnow Support . So I have to wait til morning to log into my account via my laptop and call . The next morning I call . And again the service is great and they completely understand and decides to send me a shipping label to ship my broken phone to them so that I can get a replacement phone . So let me break down this process for those who do n't already know ... FIRST : Textnow will send you a shipping label and tell you to pack up your phone , print , and attach the shipping label . NEXT : Take the phone to your nearest post office . THEN : Once they scan the shipping label it well notify TextNow systems to ship out your replacement phone . So I ca n't be too mad because that 's better than nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do it tomorrow since the post office was already closed . Later that night the phone completely dies out . Thank God I put in a order for a replacement already . The next day I received news that my husbands grandmother had passed . Everyone 's taking it a little hard so you can imagine how dysfunctional things are right now . I completely forgot about my phone and how I finally do remember it is even crazier . I 'm carrying the baby bag and my newborn baby girl in her car seat as well as juggling a few grocery bags . As I am coming thru the door of my home I here something hit the ground . Of course it was my phone . I had a slight crack on the screen but I did n't think anything of it because I knew I had already put in for a replacement phone . At the time I 'm just thinking I need to go ahead and print this shipping label and ship this phone . So , I pull up the email and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage on the device ( cracks , chips , water damage , etc ) will void your warranty , resulting in the total value of the phone being billed to your credit card . " Smdh I 'm just ... I ca n't . So I sent them a message because I do n't want to ship this phone without them knowing before hand about the cracked screen and they charge me for the full value of the phone . Especially since the cracked screen was n't the reason my phone had been acting crazy . I was having all of these problems with the phone and the battery died BEFORE the screen was cracked . <p> It was great talking with you as well . If you could possibly give me a call back as I have a question about the device . I tried calling right back but again the TextNow support number went to voicemail . <p> I 'm so sorry , I promise this is the last time I am going to ask for your assistance . Can you please call me ASAP ? I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that I would be out of town for the funeral .

If so , we actually do not handle port outs , if you have submitted the porting info to your new carrier they will have to submit the request for the port . The port out will all be automated on our end , so once we receive that information , as long as it is all correct , we will release the number to your new carrier . <p> I would also like to thank you for your patience while trying to get through to us .

That was the beginning of my nightmare . Wherever there is wireless coverage , the text only works with wireless . When I do n't have password for the wireless that the phone detects , I ca n't text . They told me to use data for text , but with only 100 MB of data , that is not practical . In order to receive emergency text , I will have to leave data on . This is not the type of " unlimited text " I intend to enter the contract with . The phone call is not reliable either . A lot of time it just rings without going anywhere . I tried to call my own home phone , and when I pick up the phone , I ca n't hear myself talking . Without phone or text , I 'm paying for nothing . I tried to cancel the plan through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They gave me a number to call , and now I have waited for more than an hour . What kind of service is this ? <h> 1 comment <p> You can use wifi to connect to the internet for calling or texting , but if the wifi network you 're using is password protected you 'll have to enter the password to use it . <p> When you do n't have a wifi connection that 's accessible by your phone , your TextNow device will use Sprint 's 3g ? 4G network . Texting takes a very small amount of data - you can send literally hundreds of texts for 1MB of data , and calling takes about 0.3MB of data per minute . <p> If and when you go over your data limit , your phone will still connect to Sprint at 2G speed . That 's all part of our unlimited data plans . So , even if you go over your data cap , your phone will not be cut off . <p> As we have no contracts , no hidden fees , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask our customers to do is to call in to TextNow Support to cancel so we can find out how we can improve our services .

@@12302563 @902563/ <h> Community <h> Post <h> Data Usage <p> I just got my phone and enabled WiFi but with the first two hours and before making a single call somehow I used 22MB of data . I thought that if you were in a WiFi location this phone used it rather than Data . I 'm afraid that in 2 hours of setting up the phone uses 22MB what will a full day use ? In your little blue book of " Tips &amp; Tricks " under " Managing Your Data Usage " it says to uninstall apps that are no longer being used as some apps may use your data while running in the background . HOW ? How do you find these apps and how do you delete them ? I 'm afraid that by morning I 'll have used every single minute of my Data ! <h> 1 comment <p> 0 <p> Hi , Lori : @qwx184682 <p> You are correct that the phone should default to wifi whenever possible , but it 's important to note that the phone needs to have access to a wifi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're using a connection that needs a password to access , you 'll need to enter the password for the wifi connection before your phone can use it . Also , if the wifi connection is a public one ( for example at a cafe or library ) , you 'll often need to open a browser window on your phone to finish signing into the wifi network . <p> A quick way to test whether your phone is connected to wifi or not is to turn off Mobile Data in your main Settings menu . If Mobile Data is off , your phone can only use wifi .

@@12302566 @902566/ <h> How do I know when my number has been successfully ported ? <h> 3 comments <p> 0 <p> Hi David , <p> Thanks for reaching out to clarify . Yes , I am showing that your number is in the process of being ported . This process typically takes 3-5 business days to complete . We are currently escalating with the porting authority to get an update on completion of your port request . Once the port is completed , you will notice the number pop into your TextNow app . <p> One thing to keep in mind is that although the FCC regulates porting of numbers , there are times that the losing carrier ( i.e. your old cell phone provider ) can hold up the process and delay the porting . Although unethical , it is not uncommon for this to happen . Sometimes , they ask for more information than initially required and therefore , slows the process and other times they stretch the process to get that final few days out of billing before moving the number over . There are also instances where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your services thus keeping the number and sometimes it 's honestly just a matter of a higher than normal porting volume . Whatever it is holding it up , porting can be tricky but typically stays within the realm of 3-5 days . Luckily it 's seamless and has little to no interruption when it does happen . Good luck ! <p> Thanks for your response and feedback . It 's great to see the members of the TextNow community get involved and provide their knowledge and experience . After all , that 's the ultimate purpose of this forum . : )

My phone says I 'm nearly out of memory and some apps might not work properly . I 've cleared the caches several times and have had a little trouble with making and receiving calls . This started just yesterday and I need some help on figuring out what to do . I wonder if my phone needs a factory reset ? I will need step-by-step instructions on doing that if so . Thank you . <h> 20 comments <p> 0 <p> Hi Kristie , <p> Thanks for reaching out to TextNow Wireless support . I see that you had called in and talked to Erin who assisted you with clearing some memory . I 'm glad she emailed you the steps for completing a factory reset . This will definitely clear out the memory and help the device perform faster . <p> If you have any other questions or concerns let us know and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Kevin . Yes , Erin helped me a lot , but once I had deleted a bunch of stuff from my phone , I still had problems in the fact that the textnow app would n't function . So I contacted a specialist in chat and was able to reset my textnow app . Apparently that was the cause of the whole problem in the first place . So now I have re-downloaded my old apps that I really wanted to keep and all seems to be good for now . The factory reset was n't necessary but would n't have been possible anyway , with the info I was given . I needed a security code of some kind and I got one in the form of six X 's . That was n't acceptable apparently . But I did n't need it , thank goodness . : ) <p> I do actually have a concern ... last night my phone acted up again , telling me the memory was getting full ... but I still have n't put any apps back on it yet . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... planning to reset the textnow app again in the morning , but never did so , and now it is slowly regaining memory again . What is going on ? Do I need to order a new phone ? This was a refurbished model . Could that be the problem ? Does the heat sometimes cause this to occur ? What do I do ? <p> Your phone will automatically update apps and services with new patches and updates , which coiuld account for the memory increase . <p> You can adjust your update settings in the Play Store app of your phone , and then tap on the Play Store main menu &gt; Settings &gt; Auto-Update Apps , and turn auto-updating off . That way , the Play Store will ask you to install the updates to a given app before they are downloaded and applied . <p> Thank you , Kevin . I appreciate your advice . I 'm writing this stuff down so I can retain it for future use . I 've only had my phone for a couple months now , so it surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did get my newest problem resolved this morning by factory resetting just the textnow app . I had a bit of a scare when I got an error report that I could n't download the update because I did n't have enough memory , but after reverting google play to the earlier version , that released enough memory to allow the upgrade . Now the phone works again , but I 'm scared to allow the google updates because I 'm pretty sure they are the cause of the problem now . It seems that I have a smart phone on which I can only make phone calls and texts . I was able to do that with my old flip phone with much less concern . I 'm literally afraid to do anything online with that phone now . When I first got it a couple months ago , I could surf the web on it , watch videos , play games ... etc . Now I do n't even have a game on there , and I wo n't even allow an upgrade to google play because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other day . This is my first smart phone so I 'm fairly inexperienced . Is it common for smart phones to act this dumb or is it just me ? LOL . ; ) <p> The Volt should have enough memory on it to use the phone normally and download apps . You do n't have to worry about downloading apps because you can always delete them if they cause trouble , and you should be able to use internet apps like Chrome or Facebook with no trouble . <p> If you do run into trouble , give us another call at TextNow Support ( or drop me an email at orders@textnow.com ) and we can assist you further .

Make sure it goes in the right way . Once you have the SD card . I would restart the phone and go from there ... <p> Andrew is right , the LG Volt supports up to a 32gb micro SD card . The link above , to the instructions , should get you all set up with the micro SD card . If you have any problems just let us know and we will assist as best we can . <p> Yeah , I knew the card was the micro type . I was trying to put it in without removing the battery . Okay . I got it now . But seriously ... should this phone need extra memory after only a couple months of use ? I activated this phone on April 4th , 2016 . It has exactly two apps that I 've downloaded . Everything else I put on there has been deleted . The problem is DEFINITELY the Google Play Services app . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . As soon as it 's updated it starts sucking memory like crazy , whether I use it or not . I will start using a memory chip but the app will probably do its best to use that up as well . <p> google play services taking up memory ? ? ? yeah that 's wierd. only thing I can think of to on that is uninstall the updates on the google services . and disabling auto updates . you go to your apps then move the screen over to " ALL " apps . and scroll down to google play services and uninstalling updates . good luck . maybe you should return the phone cause it almost sounds defective . i have the volt too and i never had that problem w/google services and memory <p> I agree that it 's weird , Andrew . It does seem to be a problem specifically with my phone because my husband and both my parents all have the Volt as well and none of them are having this issue , although my husband ca n't keep his battery charged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls . I 'm wondering if a factory reset might be the answer for this phone . Failing at that , I can only assume that the phone is the problem . We shall see . <p> Hi . I wanted to quickly update you on my device . The reason I did n't place that call is because I wanted to try a couple things myself first . No. 1 was a memory chip , ( which I still do n't have ) and no. 2 was to try downloading an app to clear memory . I started with no. 2 first and found a RAM cleaning app at the play store . Since installing it , I have re-updated all of my apps , including the one that was causing all the trouble . I clean the memory after every call , and after every usage of any kind , and the phone 's memory is holding steady now even though I 've begun re-installing some of my favorite apps . From now on , every phone I own is going to have a RAM cleaning app as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a huge difference . I 've installed the same app on my husband 's phone as well . Now all we need is an app that improves sound quality and we 've got it made . : ) Thanks a lot for all the help , Kevin and Andrew . I really appreciate it . 
@@12302588 @902588/ <h> Community <h> Post <h> Sim card / SD card slot inside phone ? <p> Just got a Moto G from TextNow and started the service . So far , everything works well except just-so-so cellular network signals , but it 's not what my question about . My question is : Do we have a sim card inside Moto G or any other phone ? And , do we have SD card slot ? Just wondering how we can expand storage space if necessary . <p> Unfortunately , I got a new question here : ) When I turned off " mobile data " to save data usage , I was not able to make a " regular " phone call via cellular network , and not able to receive a phone call either . How was that happening ? As mentioned in textnow.com , TextNow uses sprint cellular network for phone calls communications , but why it 's so different from other carriers ? With my previous carrier , I could do whatever needed even I turned off data usage . Thanks ahead for explanation . Regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the traditional carriers in that all the communication ( calls and texts ) run over the data network . You need to make sure your mobile data is turned ON at all times . Whenever your phone is in the range of a known WiFi network , it will connect to it automatically and will not use the data . <p> Thanks a lot , that does help a lot to clarify . Plus , that also helps to explain the poor quality of talk conversation even when the signal bars show very good signal coverage . Sometimes , the other end could not hear me , sometimes vise versa , and sometimes neither could hear the other end . A little disappointed so far , will check for a couple of more days and see if it 's a common situation , hopefully not : ) <p> Hi there , I really appreciate your continuing effort to solve the problem , and recently I noticed an automatic upgrade of TextNow app . However , after the automatic upgrade , I could not even make any phone call . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says " call rejected " and hang up automatically . What a disastrous upgrade you 've made ! <p> We are a VOIP ( Voice over Internet Phone ) service , therefore in order to make texts and calls you 'll need to be either connected to WiFi or have your mobile data turned on with our TextNow Wireless Service. -

After trying out all of the recommendations I found across the internet to fix this and nothing working I came across a post on this website saying TextNow phones are rooted devices with- custom roms which is why Pokemon Go does not work . My question is why is there no workaround for this issue with Pokemon Go ? - It sucks that Pokemon Go devs are shitting on their fan base by blocking rooted devices but I am on a legit TextNow phone with none of the benefits of a rooted device , only the negatives . <h> 9 comments <p> 0 <p> Hi Travis , - <p> Thanks for contacting TextNow Support ! I understand your concern over Pokemon Go being disabled on rooted devices and have a solution . I have sent - instructions to the email registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please check your email and proceed with the steps . <p> I 'm having the same issue that Travis had . I purchased 3 Samsung Galaxy s3 's with the intention to play Pokemon Go . Would you be so kind to also send me the tips you sent Travis to resolve this issue ? Much appreciated ! <p> I 'm afraid the fix that we had sent out previously for this Pokemon Go issue is no longer valid . Essentially Pokemon Go will only work with select TextNow devices and if you 're using any other device from TextNow we do not have a permanent solution to the issue you may be having. - <p> I have taken a look at you account though , and it looks like you 're using a free account . If you are using a device that is not from TextNow , you will want to contact the carrier that sold you that phone to find out if there is a reason the application is not working for you .

Every time I have updated this app I have never had any trouble with it . I am worried my messages will be deleted because they are very important to me . <p> I got a new iPhone 6 Plus S and when I backed up everything on my computer to my iPhone 6+S everything on my text now app was on my new phone including all of my messages . <p> When I previously had a iPhone 6 I deleted all my apps basically everything because I was n't going to use it . I remember when I would update the app on my iPhone 6 it would always have my messages there . There were also times where I was n't using the app for a while so the app would tell me to enter a area code and it gave me a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now back to my new iPhone 6+S ( My main phone ) . I updated the app today and it says " do not close the app while updating " , it has been an hour and it still says 0% . <p> So I wanted to check on my iPhone 6 ( the iPhone I no longer use ) if the app was working so I downloaded the app entered my username and password and it asked me for an area code because I have n't used the app in a while . I got a new number and checked my conversations on the app and none of my conversations are there . <p> THEN , I did what you asked about signing in on the website and the messages I had before are no longer there .

They are really important to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app and there were n't a lot of messages but there really important . <p> I 've always updated this app and never had a problem .

Please help me , thank you . <h> 1 comment <p> 0 <p> Hello : <p> Thanks for your very detailed post . <p> You mention that you had to get a new number because you had n't used the app in a while . TextNow does n't keep messages and conversation threads active indefinitely , so depending on how long it 's been they may no longer be available . <p> It 's also possible that you have more than one TextNow account , and have signed into the wrong one .

While our developers are diligently working on making our custom TextNow ROM compatible with new OS versions , we do not have a specific ETA for that release at the moment . Rest assured that it would be pushed out as an OTA update to your TextNow device as soon as it 's ready : ) - <p> Thanks for reaching out . At this current time , we do n't have any new updates on the estimated release date for Marshmallow on the Moto G ( 3rd Gen. ) . Ideally , we 'd like to get these updates rolled out as soon as possible , we- just need to make- everything is- running smoothly before we do ! <p> Your phone should- notify you when it 's time to update the OS via an- OTA Update . <p> Oh . I thought they were Sprint phones not TextNow made phones . I know under the phone details it says its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it say my phone number is 814-853-7655 ? Also . Is my phone locked or unlocked ? - I 'm just a bit confused on why it says that is my phone number . Wish I had known that only 3.5gb of my 8gb would be available . I probably would have waited to get a phone . Or I would have gotten one with 16gb . When I asked someone in the chat section she did n't  give me much help . I had told her I wanted a phone that did n't  have a ton of apps I would NEVER use because I wanted enough space to install some cool apps without it saying its full after just installing a few . She told me that the Samsung was horrible for excessive apps . I already know because I have a Galaxy Tablet that has a bunch of apps I 'll NEVER use like these office apps and stuff . I 'm not even sure what is wrong with it now . It says its full even though I have uninstalled EVERYTHING on it . Probably need to do a factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely and install the OS fresh on it and all that . But I 'm not that Savvy on that kind of computer stuff . Anywho wasting your reading time because its not the device that I bought for your service . But anywho she was correct about Samsung having all these useless apps . And my Moto G 3rd Gen did n't  come with anything except some Google apps , most that are needed and or used . Just she did n't  tell me that only 3.5gb of the 8 would be usable . I installed 2 apps on it and it was full . One of them was 1.5gb though . It was the Iron Maiden phone game app . Pretty fun game too . But after having a little fun on it I had to remove it so I could update the apps already on the phone . I could n't even update the apps already on it . Even moving it to an SD card did n't  do much help . Yeah , you move some of the stuff to the SD card but a lot still stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to the card . Those are just really good for pictures music and videos , and for some apps you ca n't download like if you wanted to put an NES Emulator or SNES one and some games or ROMs . Those can fully be installed on the SD card taking up no room on your actual phone . Anywho as soon as yall have a decent phone with at least 16gb for a decent price I 'll be - buying a new phone . I 'm trying to talk my mother and daughter into switching to you guys . They pay 60 a month each with Verizon on a family plan that I used to be in but got out of as soon as I could . They pay for 4gb a month and have to split between 4 people . Mother , Brother , Sister and my daughter all share a family plan . I was with Centennial Wireless from 2004 until 2009 . At that time they sold out to ATT except a few states went to Verizon . Verizon promised to never change my plan . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then but it was cheaper than prepaid . Then I had to get a new phone and that is how Verizon was able to change my plan . It started off fine and was just 70 a month . But for 2 years I was paying 10 bucks a month for insurance that I never used . And wasnt told that if my phone was lost stolen or broken it would cost me 150 to get a replacement . At Centennial is was 4 a month and 35 to replace the phone . Of course it was n't an Iphone either . But I 've never lost or broke my phone and its never been stolen . Not once since I have been with Verizon . ANd with Centennial I only had to replace my phone once . WHen they raised my bill to 120 a month I shut them off , stopped paying them , canceled my service , and kept the iphone 5c . Prepaid is the way to go now . Its a lot cheaper and no hidden fees and shit . I think as soon as their contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 a month is a lot for phone service these days. - <p> Thanks for asking some great questions . I will address each one individually to ensure we communicate everything clearly . <p> The devices we provide are based on the Sprint network , but we do produce our own custom ROM for our devices . <p> In regards to the phone number that you 're seeing in the settings of the device , this is a number that is primarily used between us and Sprint to manage your phones access to the network . This number is not really a static number and can change , so we do not recommend providing this number to anyone . You should always provide the number in the TextNow application for calling and texting purposes . <p> Our devices are not locked , but the do have the custom version of Android on them . This would make it difficult for other carriers to activate , as they are designed specifically for TextNow network access . <p> Typically , in regards to storage on the device , you mentioned quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . <p> A device that would normally have 8GB of storage available when completely empty , does in fact have that amount . Keep in mind we do need to install Android on the device , and in most cases that takes roughly 4GB of internal storage . This amount will very slightly dependant on the device model . Additionally , the ability to move an application to the SD card is largely dependant on the specific device , and the application itself . This is not something that we directly control , as it would be primarily the application developers that allow this . <p> It has been a while since it has been asked but is there an update on when we might get the marshmallow update on the Moto g3 ? This is a great phone but it lags and it would be nice to get an update since it has been over a year since Motorola issued the update . I love your prices but sometimes the service itself is n't that great and you guys are a little slow when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some marshmallow love for the g3 . <p> That 's a great inquiry , and I 've heard rumblings of great progress being made on the compatibility of Marshmallow with TextNow . I 'm afraid that there is still no ETA on the update being pushed out , but rest assured that it 's high on our priority list ! -

If you could please try to speak with one of our live chat representatives ( can be found on the bottom right hand side of this page ) for further assistance , we 'd be more than happy to help : ) <p> The process for activation will be a bit different for you because you have an active CDMA device on your account and the SIM you are trying to activate is for the GSM network . <p> Please reach out to our online chat representatives in the bottom right of this page during our hours of operation for further assistance : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EST Saturday and Sunday <p> Thanks for reaching out to TextNow Support . We 're sorry you 're having trouble activating your SIM card . We have sent you an email to get started on getting you activated . Please reply back to the email and we can sort this out for you . : ) <p> The Free App will work without a SIM card , provided you have a compatible device and and a connection to wifi . We also offer monthly plan options to be able to continue using the service when away from wifi . <p> You absolutely still can use the SIM card right away when you receive it . The reasoning behind this delayed plan purchase is due to the free month promotion . We have to take into account both the device that is being activated and the billing information used to be able to apply the free month as per our requirements . <p> I assure you that activation is quite easy , and you can contact us at orders@textnow.com with any questions , or issues you may encounter ! <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a phone you already have , you will most likely need to get it unlocked . So in order to get the unlock code to make sure your phone can get activated with one of our sim cards , you will have to contact the carrier you had originally purchased the phone from . <p> You will still need to contact the original carrier to get the unlock code for that device . If you are not sure where the phone was from originally , you should ask your friend so they can point you in the right direction ! 
@@12302635 @902635/ <p> If you 're speaking of the free TextNow app , it 's available for Android and iOS phones . Our service works over wifi or through your phone 's data plan - if you 're on a Verizon plan , you 'll have to speak to them about details on any restrictions with their data plans . <p> The free app is free , no taxes . Video messaging specifically works on any Android device running Android 5.1 or above . <p> Hey Jessica ! You seem to be using the free app , and I 'm a bit confused about the data issue , as Wi-Fi and network data would be separate . If you 're worried about the app using up your data , simply make sure that you close it when not in use . <p> With regards to the dropped calls , that may be due to a poor connection , so I 'd recommend to test it out with other connections first , and if it 's still an issue , make sure to reach out to one of our live chat representatives on textnow.com/wireless : )

I am at work right now and it is inconvenient to reply in detail to the email ( gmail is blocked , so I have to do it on the phone ) . <p> I do n't think changing the number is necessary - but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be to block incoming calls by area code . Maybe have a section on the website for logged in users to manage their blocked numbers , with an option to block by area , and/or a white-list of a similar nature ? <p> I know spammers/et. al . can spoof their numbers , but 99% of the time a call I want to accept comes from area codes within two states . Other numbers that I want to accept , that come from outside the local area codes , I could add explicitly onto the white-list . <p> I think that would be a great feature - especially since I just now got another telemarketing call . <p> Most of the unwanted calls come from outside of my local area codes - many from the 262 area code ( maybe they spoof that so people think it is a local call and therefore less likely to be telemarketing ) . <p> Horrible phone service , takes multiple tests to contact anyone from phone .

The best course of action would probably be to try reinstalling the application to make sure there is n't a software problem . If you were to delete the conversation on the app it would be deleted on the browser version of TextNow . If you need the conversation you can always take screenshots of it , and in the Android version of TextNow you can even tap the 3 dots in the top right hand corner for an option to export the conversation .

I headed to work for the next 5 hours never touched it . When i get home I press the power button to turn the display on and nothing happens . then i hold down the power button for about 10 seconds and the display turns on back to the lock screen . after connecting it to my wifi and downloading some apps , the screen froze when i recieved a message . I pushed the power button to try and get the screen to restart . and nothing , still frozen . so i held the power button down to force restart it . While trying to turn it back on it would freeze at the start up screen multiple times where the moto G changes into a world .

As I come back I press the power button and nothing . I notice my Moto G LED light that 's usually on while it 's charging was n't on either . so I figured it was dead and maybe the charger that came with it was n't working properly I plug it into another charger and the led light blinks once and dose nothing . thinking maybe that was normal i moved about with my buisness , 30 min later i try turning it on again LED light still off and again nothing .

When I return home press the power button . nothing .. hold down the power button ... nothing . I repeat the process and yet again this afternoon I finnaly put it back on the charger and the battery 0% shows again . 30 min later the phone is off , the displaywo n't click on and it wo n't charge again .

@@12302683 @902683/ <p> Not bad . The real issue with the Moto E is that it has two microphones . If you cover up the microphone on the back with a piece of tape people can hear you , and there 's no echo . This is the hole next to the camera . That is a hardware defect , not a software issue . <p> Aside from that people are probably frustrated because other messaging apps are twice as loud as TextNow . Particularly Hangouts . Of course , using those apps count against our data but there are times I 'll use Hangouts Dialer as opposed to TextNow , just for the volume . I 've even used it on 2G . I would use it more but I 'm trying to stay within the data fair use policy . From what I understand , calls routed through cellular are treated as part of the unlimited calling and VoIP calls count against data unless they 're Wi-Fi . <p> If the update is n't available on your phone , you 've either already downloaded it , or it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the update again tomorrow and let us know if you 're still having trouble getting it . <p> System update is hung on System Update screen .

I let it go for 30 minutes before hanging up since it was clear what was happening . I 've called during peak times of the day and it NEVER has taken 30+ minutes to be answered . I get it -- no one wants a guy to walk in to the store 15 minutes before closing -- but I 'm calling an hour early ? Come on . That 's just unprofessional . <p> I 'm going to check on clearing my cache in TWRP , and go through the rounds again to see if I can pull this quality update . We 'll see how it goes .

If you have trouble , try holding the power button for about 10 seconds until it turns off . <p> After it 's off , try powering it on by holding the volume up and down buttons and then press power button . Once you let the buttons go , you should see a boot menu displayed on the phone . <p> If you get to the boot menu , press the volume down key until " recovery " is selected and then press the volume up button once to select it . Once you see the android figure lying on his back press and hold the VOL UP key for 10-15 seconds . While still holding the VOL UP key tap and release the POWER key . Select " wipe data / factory reset " ( use volume up and then press power to select it ) . Then select " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's finished formatting , press the power button to confirm a reboot . <p> If that does n't work , please let me know and we can try and help you figure out how to get it going again . <p> Well , installed TWRP , because I was getting an error " Unfortunately , Google Keyboard has stopped working . " So I was gon na try and put the stock rom onto it . Once I tried that , I had gotten the error , " No OS Installed , Would you still like to reboot . " So I did a factory reset and wipe data partition , And rebooted the phone and that 's when is started the continuous reboot . I tried to go back into TWRP and it was just the regular android recovery . I guess I messed something up . I could n't find anything else online for how to fix the Google Keyboard error . And did n't know you guys had a support . Until I started looking into the textnow side of the phone . Please help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any your guys phone service is n't open till tomorrow . I really need a phone for work and stuff . <p> It 's unfortunate you tried to make changes to the lower level software on the device as it makes the situation a lot more difficult to resolve . <p> NOTE : For other users reading this , only follow these instructions if you have modified firmware on your device . Once you modify/flash software on your device from how we ship it to you , you do so at your own risk and we do n't offer support past that point if something goes wrong with your phone . <p> In this case , let 's try re-flashing our ROM on the phone to get things working again . A download link is here : <p> You 'll need android tools installed on your local machine to flash this , but based on what you already told me it sounds like you already have this setup as you flashed a custom bootloader on the device previously . Unzip the files in the zip file once you download it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume down key and pressing the power button for 1-2 seconds . <p> Once the phone is in fastboot mode , connect it to your computer over USB and run the fastboot.sh file if you are on a mac or linux computer or the fastboot.bat file if you are on a Windows computer . On linux/mac : <p> chmod +x flashall.sh . /flashall.sh <p> On Windows : <p> flashall.bat <p> Let me know how that works for you . It should restore your device to factory conditions . <p> Glad to hear the flashing helped you out here . You definitely should be able to text or call if you are off of Wi-Fi . Is that what you mean ? When you are off of Wi-Fi , then your phone will use the Sprint 3G network for calls and texts , but it uses very small amounts of data compared to other apps . All our plans have unlimited 2G data as well , so the calling and texting should have no noticeable impact on your data plan . Is the phone not connecting to the 3G network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't connect to 3G ? And okay . So maybe it 's my other apps like Facebook and Instagram using my data when , I have it off currently cause I am on Wi-Fi . But ii tt says I have already used 256mb and I do n't see how because when I was n't able to use my phone because it was n't able to turn on . It last said I had only used 83mb ? ? <p> Also , just to make sure your phone is activated on the network properly and you get 3G signal , since you reflashed it , please do the following : In the phone 's native dialer screen ( not in TextNow app ) , dial ##72786# . This should reboot the phone and force it to re-activate over the network , that should resolve any potential connectivity issues you are having . <p> In terms of the Lollipop update , yes we plan on releasing one soon . I do n't have an exact ETA on that yet , but we will push that out to the Moto G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moto X , but your suggested solutions do n't do anything , much less bring up a screen . Phone looks like it was used before you sent it to me or the manufacturer dropped it before they sent it to you . Do n't even get me started on not be able to make calls most of the first two weeks before this issue popped up or how my Wi-Fi usage is counting against the 500 MB monthly limit and yes I have it set to use the Wi-Fi option . It 's a paperweight as it sets now and my scathing blog review will reflect my experiences with it . <p> I 'm sorry to hear you are having a similar issue . The moto X 's are new , so your phone definitely should n't look like that out of the box . Also , I want to try and figure out what is happening with your phone as it should n't just randomly get stuck in a boot loop . One of our care team members will reach out to you today to try and figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this properly for you .

As such , I 've never even come close to hitting 100MB off of wifi . The Short plan is perfect for me because the data is there on those relatively rare occassions when I need it . <p> Not everybody is in the situation I 'm in with regards to wifi access , obviously , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer higher data plans , for those that want access to higher speed data for apps and services they 're using off of wifi . The banner is a way of reminding customers who are using more data-intensive applications outside of wifi that there are affordable plans to access that data . <p> We strive here at TextNow to have phones and plans to fit all needs , which is why we offer a range from the $13.99 100MB Short plan all the way up to our 6GB Quattro plan for $59.99 . We feel that these plans can stack up against any other cell phone plan in the market , with our added bonuses of no hidden fees , no contracts , no activation or cancellation charges , and no overage charges . In fact , we do n't even charge taxes ! <p> We 're a very small company ( less than 100 employees ) , and we genuinely take our customer 's feedback very seriously .

TextNow does not support roaming , so If you are going to be in an area on the map that has that designation , then you likely would not get a signal . <p> Amy Giffin January 30 , 2017 19:46 <p> Hi i 'm interested in getting service from you however i 'm wondering about rooming charges i 'm currently living in the us Portland oregon however i 'm going to be going to newcastle upon tyne england would my phone from you guys still work there ok 2nd question do you offer a discount for opening multiple accounts i would like to get a phone and plan for myself and each of my 3 sons so 4 lines would i get a special price for that my current provider takes $5 off of your bills for each additional line so currently i get $15 of of my bill thank you in advance for your help and i 'm sorry about the spelling mistakes and lack of punctuation . <p> Valeria TextNow Support January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a great vacation , first of all : ) We do n't support roaming , so you wo n't be charged for it . The caveat is that you wo n't be able to use your TextNow service outside of the US other than on Wi-Fi for this same reason . So while you may not receive data service while in England , you are welcome to connect to any Wi-Fi network and use your account for calling/texting then . <p> Secondly , I 'm afraid that we do not currently support any family plans , and as such , do not have a ' bundling ' discount in place . I do apologize for the inconvenience , and will be passing along the feedback to our development team ! <p> Please let us know if you have any further questions , and/or concerns . <p> Aliyah Frank March 04 , 2017 11:55 <p> Its been 4 months since someone last inquired about service in canada , I hope that means it is now available ? ?

We have not been able to introduce service in Canada as of yet , although we have made some great headway as of late .

Because I know I 'm at my boiling point , I keep getting the run around about the phone I ordered on the 11th and was supposed to receive on the 16th you know that 2 day shipping and I have n't received a confirmation or tracking number as of 12:30pm Wednesday the 17th . I 've spoken to Valerie a few times , the first time was placing the order , second was on the 15th because I did n't get a confirmation or tracking number and she said it would be sent out that day and of course it did n't , third I got an email from Kevin yesterday saying I would have it by Thursday and to trackit on my account page and there 's nothing , and today I spoke with Valerie again and now they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure she 's not part of the shipping team but hey do n't worry once the phone comes she will make sure I get 30 days with it I 'm sorry did n't I pay for the 30 days ? And here 's the kicker I actually told a friend about the sale , so he placed his order after me and got his phone yesterday so not only did I give them a new customer apparently they gave him my phone can someone please explain how this is possible cause it seems ridiculous to me but enough is enough I 'm not sure what is next . I think it 's appropriate to let the whole world know what kind of company TextNow really is ! ! ! Come on now I read all the problems questions and answers from the community and let 's face it when you call for support all they want to do is try a hard reset then its try that for a while if it does n't work call back and well do it again . Also since when do companies tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trying to resolve the problem and make the customer happy , twice now Valerie actually told me I could cancel the order does that sound like a good company policy go ahead and cancel we do n't want or need your business were not going to argue or worry about one customer .

Any suggestions welcomed Charles Darcy <h> 6 comments <p> 1 <p> Hello Charles , <p> Thanks for your feedback on the issue . I understand the frustration you are going through . To start off I reviewed your account and see that your phone has shipped . I have gone ahead and emailed you the tracking number . When the phone arrives we can definitely adjust the billing dates to make sure each customer gets their full month of service . <p> It was never our intention to delay any shipments . We are trying to do a good thing by offering affordable phones and plans . We do not want high costs or contracts , we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long . We did not foresee the popularity of the Sharp Aquos and Pokemon Go sale .

Instead of denying customers we did everything we could to secure more phones so that we would n't have to let anyone down . I understand it is less than ideal to wait extra time for a device you paid for , but it was never our intention to frustrate you . Our agents have done their best to keep customers informed and answer any questions they may have . <p> We really do stand behind our customers but we believe in the freedom of no contracts . If a customer is not satisfied and we have tried to address the issue we let them know we are ready to refund them . Most companies are not willing to issue refunds , but we let our customer know that it is an option available for them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is about letting you know that at the end of the day if our assistance is not acceptable we can refund you . <p> Our mission is to change the mobile industry , our phones are ultra affordable and our plans are the most economically sound .

I have gone ahead and sent you an email with your tracking number and a link to set up a call back if you would like to talk speak to us further . <p> You do n't understand , why 's UPS telling me they do n't have my phone and just because I have a tracking number does n't mean they have it , it just means a label was created so what do you have to say about that ? <p> In regards to the UPS label , I can confirm UPS has the package and it will be delivered today as per the tracking number .

They have come along way from just being an app , so please try to remember that , and like they said , they did have a really big sell so please understand that as well . These things happen its just apart of life , and i understand your frustration , but to slander there name is not the right thing to do . I hope you have your phone by now .

Does that mean that the message has not been delivered ? How can I know if my text message has been sent and delivered ? <h> 3 comments <p> 1 <p> Hi Mike , <p> Thanks for reaching out to TextNow support . You may be running an older version of the application . The little wifi icon is an old asset that displayed when the text message was pending to be sent and would disappear once the message was sent . <p> I recommend going to the app store and searching for TextNow and updating to the latest version which will improve the application on many levels and to being certain your messages are sending correctly . <p> Hey Kevin , thanks for replying . I see that the app on my phone is running version 6.9.0 . It seems to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the app store . Also just to add , when I send a text message , the app seems to freeze and crash on me " perhaps that 's the cause , but it frequently occurs . Could the reason be because I have n't update my IOS itself to the latest version ? <p> Updating the the ios may help as the TextNow application takes advantage of any system fixes and optimization that the updated ios would bring . In order for TextNow to operate correctly you should be running ios 7.0 or later . Go ahead and update the ios and let us know if how things turn out .

@@12302750 @902750/ <h> Community <h> Post <h> Need the Galaxy S5 TextNow Rom <p> I tried fixing my sprint connection problems and gps not working without wifi problem with wipe data/factory reset .. The first time I did that it seemed to fix the GPS and It was able to fix on my location without Wifi . But , then a day or two later I noticed it did n't work , so tried resetting .... a few times .. and it no longer worked .. sprint connection never improved for my location . <p> So , I decided to do a full backup using adb thinking , it wo n't hurt to give it a try . After reinstalling the backup the phone only boots to Galaxy S5 and not into the TextNow rom . <p> Instead of messing with resets or trying to restore the probably corrupted backup . Would it be possible to get the TextNow Rom for the GalaxyS5 so that I can try to reinstall that ? Maybe that would improve my Sprint signal and GPS fixing on my location problem without having to be near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . <p> I FINALLY got the rom installed on Tuesday night .. Between my work schedule .. working 6 days per week , including our July 4th holiday , the rom not wanting to install , and me not wanting to deal with it ... it just took a while to get installed or flashed . Unfortunately , though , the gps is still not working . I installed GPS Test last night . At this moment GPS Test shows that I have 23 satellites in view ... ( it ranges from 12-23 in view ) but still no GPS . <p> Just to clarify .. when I say gps will not fix on location .. I mean that it does not give me any location for where I am .. In google maps , no location is given . Tapping the gps button , nothing happens . The button is greyed .. In Navmii , it does not show any location . <p> GPS does not show as operating in any of the apps I have tried . What do you mean by Samsung GPS ? A Samsung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a phone technician ... so I do n't know for sure , but , I would think that if GPS Test is showing that 20 satellites are within view , that the GPS antenna must be working . <p> Also , did TextNow send out an update ... I just factory reset and now on startup Android is updating at about 100 of 295 apps ... Hope it is not Marshmallow ... I want to stay with 5.0 , not 6.0 . Hope the replacement is still 5.0 <p> Good . But , as many times as I have tried resetting to get the GPS work or better sprint connection ... this is the first I have seen it do that in a few weeks .. at least for that many apps ( 295 ) .. I have seen may 12-20 . <p> Wow .. guess I am a bit late for today for UPS ... Will get it to UPS and scanned this evening to make sure the replacement goes out tomorrow . <p> Thank you , Kevin for all your patience and your help . Seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions regarding this phone ..

I was wondering if a serious cache cleaning needs to be done here ? Thanks .
