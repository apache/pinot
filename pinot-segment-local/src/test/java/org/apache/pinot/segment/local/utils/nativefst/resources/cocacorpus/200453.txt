If so , what grades and in what scenarios ? <p> A bolt that has already been used in a given application may or may not be reused , depending on the grade , application , and recommendation of the " Engineer of Record " . There are a tremendous number of conflicting opinions on this subject , but the only definitive published information we can find on this issue from a reputable source is in regards to ASTM A325 and A490 structural bolts . <p> " Reuse : ASTM A490 bolts and galvanized ASTM A325 bolts shall not be reused . When approved by the Engineer of Record , plain finish- ASTM A325 bolts are permitted to be reused . Touching up or re-tightening bolts that may have been loosened by the installation of adjacent bolts shall not be considered to be a reuse . " <p> " Pretensioned installation involves the inelastic elongation of the portion of the threaded length between the nut and the thread run-out . ASTM A490 bolts and galvanized ASTM A325 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are not consistently ductile enough to undergo a second pretensioned installation . Plain- ASTM A325 bolts , however , possess sufficient ductility to undergo more than one pretensioned installation as suggested in the Guide ( Kulak et al. , 1987 ) . As a simple rule of thumb , a plain- ASTM A325 bolt is suitable for reuse if the nut can be run up the threads by hand . " <p> When reusing bolts , it is critical to involve an engineer since the reuse of the fastener depends on a variety of factors including bolt type , application , grade , finish , installation method , etc . If the bolts have been tensioned beyond their yield point , they enter the " plastic zone " ( where they elongate and do not contract once the load is removed ) , which means they may be subject to premature failure . Since it is virtually impossible to determine visually if a specific fastener has entered its plastic zone when previously used , the decision to reuse a fastener will be determined by the price to replace it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Spending a few hundred dollars replacing structural bolts supporting an overhead sign structure on the freeway makes sense when evaluating the potentially devastating consequences and liability involved in reusing bolts that may ultimately fail . On the other hand , attempting to reuse a few hundred dollars worth of bolts instead of replacing those fasteners on a noncritical pump or other piece of equipment might make sense when a failure would only result in the piece of equipment not working . <p> @Tanvir- ASTM guidelines allow for the reuse of plain steel A325 bolts at the discretion of the engineer . Reuse of galvanized A325 and A490 bolts is strictly prohibited . For other grades we are not certain . <p> @Reza- It depends on the application . Some screw grades and applications allow for loosening and re-tightening , whereas others specifically prohibit the reuse of fasteners .

@@23291008 @3291008/ <h> How a Bolt is Made <p> Follow an order through our shop and see how we make bolts . <h> Video Transcript <p> Hello ! My name is Al Fogel and I 've been the Operations Manager here at Portland Bolt since 1987 . <p> This is an inch and a quarter diameter by 48 inch long , galvanized F1554 grade 36 hex head anchor bolt . We just completed 356 of these anchor bolts for the Caney River Substation project in Howard , Kansas . <p> Weve been manufacturing bolts like these by hand since 1912 and we would like to take you through our shop to show you how a bolt like this is made . <p> The first labor operation in the manufacturing of any bolt is to cut the round bar to length . Our Peddinghaus shears function much like a guillotine and chop the steel , rather than using a saw blade to cut through it . We are capable of shearing round bar up to 2 inches in diameter and up to 100 ? in length . Bolts that are larger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Next , A hex head is hot-forged on one end of the steel rod . An induction heating coil heats the end of the round bar to approximately 2000 degrees Fahrenheit . A National Upsetter is used to forge the heated end of the rod into a hex shaped head . Gripper blocks clamp the round bar securely in place while a plunger or die compresses the heated end of the rod , reshaping it into the hex head configuration . A second position in the gripper block is used to stamp the head with the manufacturers logo and grade symbol when required . The hex head of this anchor bolt will be embedded in the concrete and is intended to provide pull-out resistance . <p> High speed cutting blades apply a chamfer to the ends of the bolts prior to threading . This beveled end will help facilitate easy assembly of the nut once the bolts have been threaded and galvanized . <p> Landis threaders are used to cut 8 ? of thread onto the end of these anchor bolts . Rotating heads contain chasers which cut away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A constant stream of cutting oil is applied to reduce friction and prevent overheating . Threads are gauged by the threading operators to ensure conformance to dimensional tolerances . <p> The bolts must be pickled prior to galvanizing . This process cleans the bolts and prepares the surface of the steel to accept the zinc . Parts are first submerged in caustic soda which removes cutting oil and other organic materials that accumulate during the manufacturing process . The bolts are then rinsed and submerged in sulfuric acid , which removes any scale from the bolts and etches the surface of the steel . The bolts are rinsed again and then submerged in flux which is a chemical that assists in the bonding of the zinc to the steel . <p> After pickling , bolts are placed in racks and lowered into a 12 foot long x 4 foot wide x 7 foot deep tank of 840 degree molten zinc . The bolts remain in the zinc between 2 to 4 minutes . When the bolts are removed from the zinc , they are spun in a high speed centrifuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proprietary nature of this process , we have not included it in this video . <p> Finally , the bolts are cooled in quench tanks so they can be inspected and packaged as soon as they are removed from the galvanizing tank . Blue paint is applied to the threaded end of F1554 grade 36 anchor bolts to identify the grade , as is required by the ASTM specification . <p> Bolts are banded to pallets , shrink wrapped , and clearly labeled .

@@23291009 @3291009/ <h> End Types for Bolts and Rods <h> What end types are available for bolts and rods ? <p> You can watch a video covering four of these point types : the chamfer , semi-cone , chisel , and 45-degree angle cut . <h> Saw cut end <p> When a large diameter or small quantity of bolts is required , Portland Bolt will saw cut the steel round bar to create the cut lengths for the finished fastener . A saw cut end is smooth and free of any deformities , but is a time consuming labor process . <h> Sheared end <p> Product examples with sheared ends:A sheared end is produced by a mechanical guillotine-like cutting process in which round bar is chopped , rather than cut . Shearing is a much faster and more cost effective process in comparison to saw cutting , especially for large quantities of parts . Due to the pressure of the process , the end of the round bar may have a small deformity at the cut end . This small lip and slightly oval end is typically removed when the bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances will the finished product have a sheared end . Portland Bolt shears round bar up to 2 ? in diameter and up to 100 ? in length . <h> Chamfer <p> A chamfer is a conical surface at the starting end of the thread . A grinding process removes the first thread of the fastener to create a bolt that will easily accept a nut . The first thread can be easily damaged in packaging , shipping , or general handling in the field and by removing it , the manufacturer ensures the fit of the nut . Most imported and mass produced fasteners are chamfered . Portland Bolt chamfers virtually all galvanized bolts to eliminate the possibility of the first thread becoming damaged during the galvanizing process . However , galvanized bolts with rolled thread do not need to be chamfered since the roll threading process naturally creates a rounded end that is work hardened and resistant to deformities and damage . <h> Semi-cone point <p> A semi-cone point describes an end that is similar to a chamfer , but has more material removed . Think of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of a semi-cone point , the material has been removed at either a 45 or 60 degree angle to about a length equal to the diameter of the bolt . Bolts with semi-cone points are very common in the pole line industry , allowing long bolts to be more easily installed in wooden poles and cross arms . Lag bolts that must be custom made due to their large diameter , length , domestic requirement , or nonstandard thread length are also a bolt that has a semi-cone point . Since large diameter lag bolts must be installed in pre-drilled pilot holes , they do not need a threaded point ( gimlet point ) or a cone point ( full point ) to physically displace the wood . Instead , custom lag screws are manufactured with a semi-cone point to allow the bolt to be inserted and threaded into a pilot hole . Semi-cone points are often used on drift pins , highway median barrier base pins , timber spikes and other pins that are being pushed through a material like wood , asphalt or soil . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip is at times required for greater penetrating capability for drift pins and some other hardware . A full cone point , depending on diameter and size of the bolt , can be more labor intensive to produce . Often a semi-cone point is sufficient for the function of the bolt and often a cone point is unnecessary . In fact , " semi-cone point " and " cone point " are relative terms that should be defined before a fastener can be produced . <h> Gimlet point <p> A gimlet point is a threaded point on the tip of a lag bolt . They are necessary for small screws and lag bolts to displace the wood and physically drill a hole for the bolt itself . Common mass-produced lag bolts from 3/4 ? diameter and smaller come with a gimlet point , but they are often unnecessary . Large diameter lag bolts must have a pilot hole drilled before the bolt can be installed . ( See our pilot hole chart for lag bolts ) A gimlet point is unnecessary for larger lag bolts since no wood will actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pilot hole has already removed the wood . Any lag bolt that Portland Bolt manufactures will not have a gimlet point , but will have a semi-cone point instead . <h> Chisel point <p> A chisel point is made with two 45 degree cuts forming a point at the end of the fastener . The vast majority of bolts that have these distinct points are lengths of all thread rod that are being embedded into already hardened concrete . The sharp point of the bolt is designed to break a capsule of epoxy at the bottom of a drilled hole , thus allowing the epoxy to fill the coat the all thread rod and bond the bolt to the concrete . Also some headed pins or unheaded pins being driven into soil or wood can use this point to facilitate the driving of the fastener . <h> 45 Degree Angle Cut <p> Much like the chisel point , the 45 degree angle cut has a primary purpose of breaking an epoxy capsule for an all thread epoxy anchor bolt. - Instead of two 45 degree cuts , this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more efficient use of material and due to the reduction in cuts allows less labor to be used in the creation of the bolt . <h> 5 comments <p> I 'm looking for a stud like bolt 1/2 inch 20 length of min 3 inches no head round with a hole at the other ens like a c=clamp stile to insert a clevis pin through it 1/4 inch to 3/8 I do n't  know the name of it but I have a picture I can send if possible <p> This sounds like a proprietary Simpson Strong Tie design that is used primarily in residential construction . Traditional bent anchor bolts , headed anchor bolts , and anchor rods manufactured by Portland Bolt are used in heavy , industrial applications . <p> @Angel Thanks for the great question .

@@23291010 @3291010/ <h> Bolt Shear Strength Considerations <h> What is the shear strength of carbon steel bolts ? <p> First , unlike tensile and yield strengths , there are no published shear strength values or requirements for ASTM specifications . The Industrial Fastener Institute ( Inch Fastener Standards , 7th ed. 2003 . B-8 ) states that shear strength is approximately 60% of the minimum tensile strength . <p> " As an empirical guide , shear strengths of carbon steel fasteners may be assumed to be approximately 60 percent of their specified minimum tensile strengths . For example , an SAE grade 5 hex cap screw has a specified minimum tensile strength of 120,000 psi . Therefore , for design purposes , its shear strength could be reasonably assumed to be 70,000 psi . " <p> It is important to understand that some imported fasteners , like lag screws , are typically ungraded . Since they are not manufactured to any specific grade , it is impossible to determine any strength characteristics associated with them unless you have them strength tested at a laboratory . For applications where shear will occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to calculate the value . Whereas , if the shear area is in the threaded section the minor diameter should be used . <p> I 'm not the best at your equation for sheering force so maybe you can do it . I would like to know what the sheering force of a m6x1.0 bolt . I have 4 of them holding a pully to a drive snout and sheered all 4 off . They were rated at 12.9 , is there any other bolt I can use ? Thanks <p> Dear Manager , I am looking the anchor bolt or pin , that can stands up to 5000 lb. force or break away force 5000 lb . Do you have any kind of material to match specification ? I need this on one of project . Raman . <p> @Raman- If you are using low carbon , A36 material for the pins , you would need a 1/2 ? or larger pin in order to withstand 5,000lbs of shear . If you want to go with a smaller pin , that can be done as well , but I 'd need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade of material . <p> @Gene We previously determined that the min shear value for stainless is 45,000psi . If you want a min shear value of 5,000lbf , we look at this equation : 45,000 x pi x r2=5,000 . I get r=0.187 , so your min diameter to achieve 5,000 lbs of shear is 0.374 ? =3/8 ? . That does n't  include any safety factors , so that diameter should be padded by whatever safety factor you feel safe with . I hope that helps . <p> @MarkSeavey We do have tensile and yield mechanicals for stainless steels made per ASTM A193 on our website . We do not list shear , but it is typically 60% of tensile . For other grades of stainless I 'd be happy to give you what I have if you let me know what grade/specification you are working with . <p> if you are using a bolt in a high movement/lateral stress area and it keeps breaking <p> you might try using either lots of washers or thick spacers. so you end up with a longer bolt . <p> examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> the longer bolt means when the items flexs the angle is less than that of a shorter bolt . sometimes a super tight bolt hole can cause you more problems than benefits . but obviously this is job specific . <p> It is true that grade 8 bolts are more brittle than grade 5 . In general ( although not always the case ) , steels that have a higher strength are less ductile . Grade 8 bolts have a higher strength and , therefore , would require fewer bolts in a joint than grade 5 . This may be of benefit in joints that are tight for space . However , depending on the application , it may be preferable to use the weaker and more ductile grade grade 5 bolts . The statement that grade 8 bolts are better than grade 5 can not be generalized . Consult with an engineer ( structural or mechanical ) about your particular application . <p> The shear strength of bolts is taken as approximately 60% of the tensile strength . This is not a rule of thumb . A large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has indicated that the shear strength is about 62% of the tensile strength . A purely theoretical relationship between shear strength and tensile strength indicates that the shear strength is 58% of the tensile strength . In practice we use 60% as a good approximation of test results and theory . <p> There is a UK company called Bolt Science who have computer programs on bolt tensile strengths ( there used to be a free time limited demo as well ! ) There is also a rule of thumb that puts shear strength as 60% of tensile strength . Put the two together and voila ! Note however that antique solid mounted diesel engines can wreak havoc on their mounting frames and wont be the least impressed with ones clever calculations ! Salt can also give unexpected results as tests done a great many years ago on chains showed that they were weaker when immersed in seawater . Ideally the bolts should only be loaded to about 10% of their failure load , possibly 20% on a rough job . <p> @Herb : Due to liability issues and given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , we are not in a position to answer questions regarding the use of specific quantities , sizes and grades of fasteners for a specific application . Please consider consulting a structural engineer for assistance with this question . Sorry we could n't be of more assistance . <p> When a bolt is used in a sheer load is it better to use grade 5 or grade 8 ? I 've heard that grade 8 bolts are harder and therfore more brittle . Assuming a good fit with no slop in the assembly or a slightly loose fit say 25-30 thousandths.

Specifically , section X2.1 " Coatings and Application Limits . In this section it states that coated fasteners should not be used at temperatures above one half of the coating 's melting point . The melting point of elemental zinc is approximately 780- F ( 415- C ) .

When fasteners undergo mechanical testing , they are pulled to failure and the diameter of the point at which the fastener breaks is measured and compared to the original diameter . The difference between the original sample and the broken piece is calculated and reported as the reduction of area percentage . <p> Each grade of ASTM F1554 has a minimum requirement to meet .

@@23291017 @3291017/ <h> Stainless Steel Bolt Differences <p> Hex bolts are often ordered as a type 304 stainless and not to a specific ASTM specification . When bolts are ordered under the raw material grade ( type 304 ) and not to an ASTM fastener specification , there are no specific requirements other than that they meet the chemical and physical requirements of 304 stainless steel and ASME B18.2.1 dimensional requirements for hex bolts . National coarse thread will typically be provided unless otherwise specified . <p> Type 304 stainless steel hex bolts that are ordered under the ASTM fastener specification A193 grade B8 are required to be both carbide solution annealed and stamped per the A193 specification . Carbide solution annealing is a process of heating the material up to a temperature of 1,950 degrees or above and maintaining the temperature long enough for the chromium carbides to go into the solution . This process will bring the bolts back to their optimal corrosion resistant condition after the forging ( heading ) process .

Therefore , pickling and passivating is optional and should be specified by the purchaser at the time of inquiry and order . Pickling and passivating will increase the cost of the bolts and add to the lead time required to manufacture the product . <p> @Martin- Most off the shelf stainless 304 or 316 bar is actually more ductile ( less brittle ) than F1554 gr.36,55 or 105 .

Are we missing any information in the mill certification for the F1554 " see attached " is the provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F1554 ? <p> Thank you for your help <p> To address your first question : <p> ASTM A36 is a steel grade , not a bolt specification . It covers the raw material ( in this case steel round bar ) that is used to manufacture the bolts . A307 and F1554 grade 36 are ASTM specifications covering bolts . Both A307 and F1554 grade 36 bolts are frequently manufactured using A36 steel . ASTM A307 is a specification that covers mild steel bolts . There are two grades within the ASTM specification . A307 grade A covers bolts for general applications , while A307 grade B covers heavy hex bolts and studs for cast iron flanges . There used to be an A307 grade C specification covering anchor bolts , but it was eliminated in 2007 and subsequently replaced by F1554 grade 36 . <p> Both A307 grade C ( when it existed ) and F1554 grade 36 have chemical and mechanical ( strength ) requirements that must be met in order to certify the bolts to these specifications .

For the anchor bolts in question , either this test was never performed or the data was never recorded on the test report . Most likely , the test was not performed since this is only a test of F1554 and not a test required of A307 . Since this value is missing , there is no way to determine whether or not the bolts that were supplied ( and are already in the foundation ) have enough ductility ( as determined by the Reduction of Area test ) to meet the requirements of F1554 grade 36 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet this requirement if they were tested , but they never were . Therefore , based on the test reports that accompanied the bolts that were supplied , these anchor bolts do not meet all of the requirements of F1554 grade 36 . Tensile , yield , and elongation are all good , but the reduction of area requirement has not been met . <p> Many companies attempt to substitute A307 anchor bolts for F1554 grade 36 anchor bolts as has occurred in this case . The bottom line is that these anchor bolts that were supplied are missing data that is required to certify them to F1554 grade 36 . <p> @Eduardo- The AISC guidelines say that snug tight is all that is required for anchor bolts , unless the project engineer says otherwise . If that is the case , then he/she should supply you with the necessary information to torque them properly . <p> This was an extremely helpful article for me .

@@23291021 @3291021/ <h> Rotational Capacity Testing <h> What is rotational capacity ( ROCAP ) testing ? <p> Per ASTM A325 section 6.3.1 , the rotational capacity test is defined as a test , " that is intended to evaluate the presence of a lubricant , the efficiency of the lubricant , and the compatibility of assemblies as represented by the components selected for testing . " In a 1970 study referenced by the Research Council on Structural Connections ( RCSC ) , it was shown that galvanizing increases the friction between the bolt and nut threads as well as the variability of the torque-induced pretension . A lower required torque value and more consistent results are obtained when lubricated nuts are used as part of the bolt assembly . Rotational capacity testing must show that the galvanized lubricated nut may be rotated from the snug tight condition well in excess of the rotation required for pretensioned installation without stripping . In laymans terms , the test is required to show that the nut will not gall on the bolt and that the assembly will develop the pretension load desired . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt and nut be tested individually , contractors will typically administer this test on the job site .

Standard A325 Rotational Capacity Procedure <p> The bolt , nut , washer assembly shall be assembled in to a steel joint so that 3-5 threads are located between the bearing surfaces of the bolt head and nut .

Elongation of the bolt , between the nut and bolt head is to be expected and should not be classified as a failure . <p> This Rotational Capacity Test follows the same general procedures as the standard test , but with a few more measurements and details . The bolt assembly is tightened to a specified initial tension ( example : 3/4 ? = 3kips ) and the nut position is marked relative to the bolt head . The assembly is then tightened to a minimum specified tension ( 3/4 ? = 28kips ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exceed the stated maximum ( 3/4 ? = 438ft-lbs ) .

But what about plain black bolts ? Our office is tasked with doing this on A325 Class 3 bolts , but since all they have is the water soluble cutting fluid from the manufacturing process , many of these fail due to exceeding the maximum torque values that are allowed . <p> @David- You are correct , normal , black bolts and nuts are not normally lubricated , other than the residual oily cutting fluid . There are two ways that the lack of lubricant can be overcome . First , and easiest , is by adding some sort of stick wax in the field . This is commonly done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state DOT 's are fine with this practice . The second option is to specify supplement S1 in A563 . This requires that the nuts , regardless of finish , be lubricated . This method , although possible , is likely going to add considerable cost and time since it would be a special run . <p> @Bambang- It sounds very similar , but without seeing specifics of the test they perform , I could n't be certain . Both ASTM and AASHTO have very specific requirements for their respective rocap tests in regards to torque , tension and configuration . <p> If the bolts are only required to be installed to a snug tight condition , is the ROCAP test still a requirement ? I see no indication in any specification that this test is waived for snug tight installations , but I see no value in performing the test in this situation . <p> @Mark Neither ASTM nor AASHTO have any provisions for waiving the rocap test in situations like these , but I would assume the the engineer of record would be able to waive them , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A325 states that the rotational capacity testing shall be performed by the responsible party prior to shipment . The responsible party is defined as the organization that supplies the fastener to the purchaser . Does n't  this mean that the test should be done every time by the bolt manufacturer ? <p> @Joel In theory , yes . However , the test is only valid with a matched set of nut and washer . If the bolt manufacturer is selling the bolts without nuts or washers , as is common , then the test is invalid . Additionally , there is a considerable cost to perform the test , so virtually all manufacturers only perform it when requested and when selling the bolts/nuts/washers as a complete assembly . The ASTM committee is working on making the rotational capacity test a supplemental requirement , but the revision is still in committee for now .

In this case , a hole may be drilled in the middle of one side of the coupling nut . This aids in the visual inspection to ensure that both rod ends are in fact meeting in the middle , not off center . According to IFI-128 , note 7 , the hole should be located at mid nut thickness and have a diameter of 0.2 to 0.4 times nominal nut size for sizes 2-1/2 ? and smaller .

@@23291029 @3291029/ <h> Headed Bolts vs Rod with a Nut <h> Can a rod with a welded nut be substituted for a bolt with a forged head ? <p> When a rod with a nut is substituted for a bolt with a forged head , two issues come into play . In-house mechanical testing performed by Portland Bolt on headed bolts versus rods with a nut , both from the identical lots of steel , the rod with a nut developed up to 12% less strength than the comparable headed bolt . The reason for this reduction in strength on the rod with nut is that the stress area at the junction of the rod and nut ( which is substituting for the forged bolt head ) is significantly reduced . Because the minor diameter ( valley ) of the threads is significantly less than the full size diameter of the shank on a headed bolt , the rod with nut often breaks at a much lower strength than a headed bolt . More importantly , even if the rod with nut does develop enough strength to meet the specification , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is acting as the head of the bolt when wedge tested per ASTM F606 . For this reason , technically a rod with nut in lieu of a headed bolt will frequently fail mechanical testing because the head ( nut in this case ) comes off before the bolt breaks in the body or threaded section of the fastener which constitutes an automatic failure . <p> We often see fastener distributors and manufacturers without forging capabilities talking customers into switching from a headed bolt to a rod with a nut since they are unable to provide the forged product that was engineered into the structure . Making the decision to switch from a bolt with a forged head to a rod with a nut should always be approved by an engineer to prevent any liability in making such a substitution should a failure of the fasteners occur . <h> Wedge Testing per ASTM F606 <p> Headed BoltRod with a Nut <p> Note : Wedge testing as shown above is required to obtain mechanical properties for most ASTM high strength fasteners . A greater difference was found for high strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of headed bolts versus rods with a nut . The reduced cross sectional area at the junction of the nut as compared to a bolt with a forged head caused the fasteners with a nut acting as a bolt head to break at lower strengths than the bolts with forged heads . Additionally , the high strength rods with a nut acting as a head broke just below the nut which would automatically constitute a failure since the wedge test requires the bolt to break either in the body of the bolt or in the threaded portion , not at the junction of the head . <h> 17 comments <p> It appears that the test with a wedge induces a moment on the bolt that hastens failure as opposed to a straight tensile pull . AISC formulas account for the root diameter so it seems that when one specifies a threaded rod we would get the published capacities in straight tension with a threaded rod . Is this test applicable to to how we load an embedded anchor ? <p> @Landon- The wedge under the head does not hasten failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and the ductility of the material . The bolts should fracture at the same point and in the threads regardless of whether they are tested with or without a wedge . Now , if we were testing a threaded rod without a head , then the wedge would hasten failure , but those are instead tested without a wedge . <p> I would like to see the math on this . In the comments , it appears that the headed bolt and the threaded rod were compared using nominal specifications , e.g. a three-quarter inch bolt vs. three-quarter inch threaded rod . But , what is the comparison in psi ? * This article shows that it is an error to simply replace a specified headed bolt with threaded rod of the same nominal diameter . The article also says a change must be engineer approved . * What I want to know is this : If a contractor prefers working with threaded rod , what adjustments do I make ? <p> @Robert- We no longer have those specific test results , as they were performed many years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to highlight our heading capabilities and simply let the end user know that if the engineer has specified headed bolts , they should use caution before simply substituting a threaded rod , as it is not necessarily equal . As for your last question , it depends . If the bolt is in shear or straight tension , the difference between the headed bolt and the rod may be negligible . However if there are angled or moment forces at play , the headed bolt will be superior and if you 'd like to substitute a rod , you may need to play with the design to make sure you do n't  get yourself in trouble . <p> Can you tell me the shear strength of threaded rod with a nut . I have job that is attaching anchors in trees . The spec calls for threaded rod so that the tree will grow around the rod . I need to attach fixtures that will hang on the rods . I need a 10,000 lbs shear . The hanger will have a 1/2 " sleeve around the rod with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tightened with a washer , and lock nut . Thanks <p> @Steve- It will depend which grade of all thread you are using . Assuming A307A mild steel , you would need 3/4-10 all thread rod to achieve 10,000lbs of shear . If you were to move up to A193B7 all thread rod , you could reduce your diameter to 1/2-13 . <p> @Jessie Grade 8 all thread , or any grade 8 fastener will have a minimum tensile strength of 150,000psi . To calculate the specific tensile strength of your size of all thread rod , you will need to multiply 150,000 by the tensile stress area of your diameter . Those values can be found on our website in the Technical Information area under Thread Pitch Chart . <p> John , a smooth-sided anchor BOLT embedded in concrete works differently to an embedded rebar . It is preferable to use a BOLT since the head grabs the concrete deep within , rather than spreading the bond along its length . Failure of the concrete in this case is closer to the surface , which is undesirable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stretch all the way down to the head , and thus be correctly torqued . <p> This test is all well and good , but when a threaded rod is embedded in concrete , I would think it would more securely " bond " with the concrete along the length of the threads and distribute the tensile load better than a headed anchor bolt with a smooth shaft , which would only resist forces at the head . But this is just my intuitive thoughts of the situation maybe someone can comment and let me know for sure . I know that is at least how rebar works though . <p> @John The concern here is in substituting one for the other . When a rod with nut is substituted for a headed bolt , the concern is that the rod/nut may not perform as well as the headed bolt . At the junction of the nut with threads , the minor diameter is smaller than at the junction of the forged head/shank . When these two combinations are tested in a lab , the forged head is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its weakest point , by substituting the rod/nut for a headed bolt , you are possibly moving that point from the threads on the top to the junction on the bottom . That may create problems and is a decision that an engineer should make . <p> @Rodel Minlay Tack welding shouldnt make a difference in this case . In fact , most of the rods with nuts that are substituted for headed bolts are tack-welded by default . The real reduction in ultimate tensile strength in a rod with a nut stems from the fact that the tensile stress area on the threaded portion of the rod is the minor diameter of the thread , whereas the tensile stress area of a headed bolt is the full shank diameter .

@@23291039 @3291039/ <h> Washers for Structural Bolts <h> Are washers required to be used with an A325 or A490 structural bolt ? <p> It is known that the required grade of washer to be used with an A325 or A490 structural bolt is an ASTM F436 hardened washer , however whether or not a washer is required to be used in a given application is often brought into question . The purpose of using a flat washer with a bolt is to provide a smooth bearing surface under the head of the bolt and / or nut . There are different grades and styles of washers , which may differ in their thickness and outside diameter , providing a larger or smaller bearing surface . Per the ASTM A325 and A490 specification , they are specific to the grade of washer that is recommended , however it is not stated that a washer is required . <p> Although the ASTM A325 and A490 specifications do not require the use of a washer , there are a few circumstances where we know for sure that F436 hardened washers are required . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being connected can determine whether or not a washer should be used . Specifically , if the material being connected has specified minimum yield strength of less than 40 ksi , a washer should be used . According to the AISC 13th Edition , page 16.2-40 : <p> " When ASTM A490 bolts are pretensioned in connected material of specified minimum yield strength less than 40 ksi , ASTM F436 washers shall be used under both the bolt head and the nut " <p> It is worth noting that an A490 strength , round head tension control bolt who 's head meets the bearing surface diameter requirements of ASTM F1852 , does not require a flat washer under the head . The only other circumstance where a washer is required is if the hole in which the bolt is being inserted is oversize or slotted . The washer requirements for this situation are found in Table 6.1 in the AISC 13th Edition , page 16.2-41 , which is summarized below . <h> 36 comments <p> @Narendra- We see two immediate disadvantages . First is cost . Washers may only be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can add up . Second is thread length . A325 and A490 bolts have short thread lengths to help control threads in the shear plane , so depending on how your joint was designed , it is possible that you may not have enough thread stick out to accommodate a washer . <p> @Veeramani- The thickness for a 3/4 ? F436 washer is 0.122 ? to 0.177 ? . For a 1 ? washer , the thickness is 0.136 ? to 0.177 ? . As for your second question , the difference is bolt style . A325 and F1852 are mechanically and chemically identical , but A325 covers heavy hex head bolts , whereas F1852 covers tension control/twist-off bolts .

Thanks . <p> Your first question , is it appropriate to specify ASTM F1136 Grade 3 , would be best answered by an engineer familiar with the coating and the application . I do not believe that F1136 has the same corrosion resistance properties as hot-dip galvanizing , I think that hot-dip galvanizing continues to be a superior coating , but it does have it 's drawbacks , such as a lack of smooth finish and some surface irregularities .

@@23291073 @3291073/ <h> Stainless Steel Grades <h> What are the differences between 18-8 , type 304 , and type 316 stainless steels ? <p> To answer this question , you first need to know some basic information about stainless steel . " Stainless Steel " is the general name for a large family of alloy steels that contain at least 10.5% chromium as part of their composition . At and above this level of chromium , a complex chrome-oxide surface layer forms that prevents further oxygen atoms from penetrating into the steel and thus protects the iron in the matrix from rusting . This layer is what makes the steel " stainless . " Higher levels of chromium and the addition of other alloying elements such as molybdenum and nickel enhance this protective barrier and further improve the corrosion resistance of the stainless steel . There are many different types of stainless , but by far the most popular and widely used are the 300 series stainless steels , also known as the austenitic stainless steels . <p> The 300 series designation contains many different compositions of alloy steel ( 303 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. ) but the common factors among them are : <p> Their carbon content is generally held to a maximum of 0.08% <p> They ( generally ) have 18% chromium <p> They ( generally ) have 8% nickel <p> They are non-magnetic <p> They can not be hardened by heat treatment <p> They can be hardened by cold working the material ( " work hardening . " ) <p> The term " 18-8 " is often used to designate products made from 300 series stainless . This " 18-8 " call out is referring to the 18% chromium/8% nickel alloy mixture of the steel . " 18-8 " is not an actual specification , as it only refers to two different alloys in the steel . While all 300 series stainless steels share this 18/8 mix , slight differences in chemical composition between the different grades of the 300 series do make certain grades more resistant than others against particular types of corrosion . In the fastener industry the term " 18-8 " is often used as a designation for a bolt , nut , or washer manufactured from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickel alloy mixture . However , a fastener manufactured from stainless material that meets the 18/8 alloy mix does not necessarily meet the other slight differences in chemistry required to certify it as Type 304 stainless . Type 304 is by far the most popular of the 300 series stainless steels . <p> The second most popular type of stainless , after Type 304 , is Type 316 . In Type 316 stainless , the chromium content is lowered from 18% to 16% , however , the nickel content is raised to 10% and 2% molybdenum is added to the mixture . This change in the chromium/nickel ratio and the addition of the molybdenum increases the resistance to chlorides . This is why Type 316 stainless is often used in more corrosive environments where the material will be exposed to chemical , solvent , or salt water corrosion and makes it the preferred material for marine construction . <p> Although fasteners can ( and often are ) ordered as simply Type 304 or Type 316 stainless , the actual ASTM specifications that cover stainless steel fasteners are A193 , A320 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ASTM specifications can be found in another FAQ . <p> Portland Bolt can manufacture stainless steel bolts , rods , and bent bolts from both Type 304 and Type 316 .

Although available for steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you help ? <p> @JMoss- We do not have any published information for the shear strength of stainless steel , but the rule of thumb is that shear strength is about 60% of tensile . Grades within the 18-8 family of stainless alloys have a minimum tensile of 75,000psi , so the shear strength would be roughly 45,000psi . If you multiply that by the stress area of the screws , that will give you the shear strength of the screws . <p> @Don- It depends on how the bolts were manufactured . Cold formed bolts , which are virtually all mass produced bolts , shouldnt need additional passivation after manufacture . Hot formed bolts would benefit from passivation , but we could n't say if it is absolutely necessary . The protective film that stainless has will generate by itself , the passivation process speeds that up . No , we do not offer that in-house , but can send the bolts to a local company to have it performed . <p> @Hendra- We have some general purpose torque values on our website , but they are mostly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have any torque values for studs nor stainless steel since we have yet to find reliable technical information due to the tricky nature of torque . <p> @Richard- to be 100% certain you 'd need to have them analyzed . A common misconception is that stainless steel is not magnetic . Magnetism has more to do with the grain structure than the chemical make up , so it is certainly possible that your thumbscrews could be magnetic if they were manufactured in a way that aligned the grain structure just so . As for the rusting , you are correct that after just one month it is surprising to see surface rust . However , if you live in a humid , salty area ( like the beach ) , that will effect the screws more than if you live in a dry environment . All stainless steels will eventually corrode , just at a slower rate than their steel counterparts . It is also possible that your screws have some residual steel dust from the manufacturing or storing/shipping process , so that could contribute as well .

Ca n't we use SS304 for the food grade applications ? <p> @Chuck Coats Yes , the 18-8 screws would be corrosion resistant . As for the magnetic question , the screws may or may not be magnetic , it depends on how they were processed . Magnetism has more to do with the steel 's grain microstructure than with its chemical make-up , so whether or not your stainless will be magnetic will depend on not only its microstructure , but also how it was manufactured or processed . The most common stainless steels , 304 ( 18-8 ) and 316 , have an austenitic microstructure and start out life non-magnetic . However as they are manufactured from raw steel to fasteners , they go through several cold forming processes ( drawing , roll threading , heading ) which changes the microstructure from austenitic to martensitic , thereby making the material more magnetic . The more cold forming , the more its microstructure is changed to martensite , and subsequently the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be annealed after forming to rid them of their magnetic properties . <p> I am asst. to Metal Scuplturer and he want to use Stainless steel 20 gauge and he did n't  want any " black Rust " on it as it happened to his Stanless steel scuplture for Interior so We bought T3042b Stainless steel sheet and he said itis different in weight .

Stainless 316 has as its primary alloying elements Chromium and Nickel , whereas 17-4 has , in addition to Chromium and Nickel , Copper and trace amounts of Columbium and Titanium . 17-4 can be heat treated to increase the mechanical properties , where 316 can not . I can not speak to any corrosion or performance differences , as we have limited experience with 17-4 stainless and do not have any engineers on staff .

@@23291076 @3291076/ <h> Ordering A193 Class 2 Bolts <h> What is an " A193 Class 2 " heavy hex bolt and how do I order them ? <p> ASTM A193 is a specification for alloy and stainless steel fasteners for high temperature service , high pressure service , or both . Within the A193 specification there are multiple grades of bolts made from either alloy or stainless steel . The stainless steel grades , such as B8 and B8M , can be ordered as either Class 1 ( carbide solution treated ) or Class 2 ( carbide solution treated and strain hardened ) . To understand the peculiarities of strain hardened material , you need to understand the strain hardening process , and the different ways in which class 2 bolts can be manufactured . <h> What is Strain Hardening ? <p> As stated in the ASTM A193 specification , strain hardening is achieved by " reducing oversized bars or wire to the desired final size by cold drawing or other process . " In essence , stainless steel material of a larger diameter than is required for the finished round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because the material is under a huge amount of tension and pressure during this process , the strain reduces the material down to a smaller diameter , while at the same time work hardening it to a higher strength . <p> Because of the way in which Class 2 material is strain hardened , there are some potential issues involved with producing headed bolts to this specification . There are three different ways in which a headed bolt can be made from raw steel . <h> Cold Forming <p> The first method is cold forming . This is the method used by most mass production fastener manufacturers . In this method , raw steel , usually coiled wire stock , is cold worked by a bolt making machine that is set up to make the same part over and over in mass production runs of thousands of bolts . No heat is applied during the manufacture of this style of fastener , thus , it is cold formed . Because there is no heat involved in the manufacture , Class 2 bolts can be made in this process without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available from overseas manufacturers ( imports ) that will meet this specification . The only potential problems are with non-standard sizes or jobs that require the bolts to be domestically manufactured ( Buy America Act or similar ) . In the case of non-standard sizes , overseas manufacturers usually have lead times of several months or more to manufacture a non-standard size fastener under this specification and ship it to the U.S. In the case of domestic bolts , there are only a limited number of cold formed fastener manufacturers in the U.S. and all of them are mass production facilities that will not even consider a special production run of bolts unless it is for a quantity of several thousand bolts , if not more . <h> Hot Forging <p> The second way in which headed bolts can be manufactured is hot forging . This is how Portland Bolt manufactures headed bolts . In this process the raw steel is heated , usually through electrical induction , until the end of the steel bar is red hot . At that point the heated end is placed into an upsetter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or other shape if required ) . Because of the heating involved in the forging process , the mechanical properties of the steel in the heated portion can be altered . In low carbon steels this is not an issue . With higher strength alloy steels , the mechanical properties are restored through a heat treating process after hot forging is complete . However , in the case of A193 Class 2 material , headed bolts CAN NOT be manufactured by the hot forging process . This is because when Class 2 material is heated prior to forging , the heat relieves that tension of the material in the heated area . Consequently , that portion of the bolt would no longer be strain hardened . There is no process that exists to restore this portion of the bolt to a strain hardened state after it has been heated . <h> Machining from Bar Stock <p> The third possible way to manufacture a bolt to this specification is a rarely used form of bolt manufacture , machining from bar stock . There are also potential problems with manufacturing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specification states that in the case of large diameter bars , the strain hardening will not occur evenly throughout the material . Specifically , " plastic deformation will occur principally in the outer regions of the bar so that the increased strength and hardness due to strain hardening is achieved predominantly near the surface of the bar . " Because of this , if a bolt is machined from larger diameter strain hardened material , the finished bolt would have the correct strength and hardness in the bolt head , but the body ( which was in the center of the original , larger bar ) would most likely have a much lower strength and hardness because the strain hardening process did not penetrate the center of the material . Consequently , the finished bolt would not meet the requirements of A193 Class 2 . Additionally , strain hardened round bar is typically not readily available in diameters larger than 1-1/2 ? . <p> This FAQ should help explain some of the peculiarities , technical challenges , and limitations of the types of bolts that can be manufactured to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fastener , or any other fastener specification , and have questions or concerns , please contact our knowledgeable sales staff . <p> @Swan- If you are able to procure SS304 material that meets the mechanical requirements of A193 B8 class 2 , then yes , you can machine the threads . It is also a requirement of A193 that the end be stamped with the grade symbol and the manufacturers registered I 'd stamp . <p> @Nipol- You would only need to re-carbide solution anneal the studs if a heating operation was performed ( like forging or welding ) that could adversely affect the material . If you are simply threading or cutting the material , there is no need to re-solution anneal . <p> @Marvin Class 2 bolts are much stronger than class 1 bolts , so if the design calls for class 2 , and you substitute class 1 , then yes , you may have a problem . You should consult with the project engineer to see if this change is acceptable . <p> @Nipolw- It depends on the grade of A193 you are making . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end in " A " like B8MA require carbide solution treating regardless of the manufacturing method used . With more common grades , like B8 and B8M , you should n't have to carbide solution anneal if you machined the bolt out of bar . <p> FYI Regarding machining Class 2 bolts from larger diameter bar , most of the strain hardening can be put back into the shank by flat rolling and if you thread roll , that by itself can increase the strength enough . Combined with shear and tensile tests to evaluate the amount of reduction required , you can re-establish the properties . Unfortunately , you can do the math to determine the required amount of reduction but its really not accurate . Anyway , this was the Old School way of handling it .

Hot-dip galvanized nuts need to be used with hot-dip galvanized bolts since galvanized nuts are tapped oversize to accommodate for the extra 2 " 6 mils ( .002 " .006 ) of zinc that is added to the threads of the bolt during the galvanizing process . A common misconception is that bolts that are going to be hot-dip galvanized are threaded undersize since the galvanizing will increase the size of the threads . This is not correct . Bolts are threaded to the same tolerances , regardless of whether they will be galvanized or remain plain finish . Instead , it is the nuts that are tapped oversize to allow for the zinc on the threads of the galvanized bolt .

@@23291086 @3291086/ <h> What is rebar ? <p> Rebar is short for " reinforcing bar " and often used in concrete foundations to strengthen the concrete . It is held in place by systematic ridges or deformations in its surface that allow the concrete to " grip " the bar better than plain round bar . These deformations are a great asset in the masonry applications , but hinder the usefulness of rebar as a threaded fastener . <p> Rebar gauges ( diameter of the bar ) are measured in eighths of an inch .

This will lead to incomplete threads and the liability that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the diameter on #8 rebar between the deformations is .960 and the minimum allowed major diameter on 1 ? threads is .9755 . <p> How to properly cut thread rebar <p> The only way to correctly thread rebar is by turning down , or milling the end of the rod so that it is the proper size and shape to be threaded . This is done by removing the outer layer of the bar until the diameter is equal to the deepest deformation on the bar , leaving a smooth surface to thread . The smaller diameter of the threaded portion means that a larger size of rebar will have to be used and turned down in order to have threads that are the correct nominal diameter . If we go back to our example rebar above , we would need to use #9 rebar , instead of #8 in order to have proper 1 UNC threads . <p> Things to keep in mind when ordering threaded rebar <p> In cases where plans call for threaded rebar , it is essential that the engineer or detailer specify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threading a #8 rebar will not result in a complete 1 ?

" 10 thread per inch finished product . <h> Roll Threading Rebar <p> As opposed to cut threading , the threads on rebar can also be produced through a roll threading process . For the differences and limitations of roll threading versus cut threading , refer to our FAQ discussing roll threading versus cut threading . Keep in mind that roll threading equipment is limited in the marketplace and many companies that produce threaded rebar will not have the equipment available to roll threads . Most machine shops and smaller scale bolt manufacturing companies only have equipment that is capable of cut threading . <p> Unlike the cut thread example above , rebar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our example using #8 rebar ) and rolled back up to produce a fully functional , dimensionally correct 1 ? - 8 UNC thread . Since some roll threading equipment has diameter and length limitations , rolling threads on rebar is sometimes not possible . Again , the thread dimension in addition to the size of the rebar should be specified . <p> To specify threaded rebar properly , our inquiry for this example should read as follows : <p> @Nishad- ASTM F606 discusses the testing of general threaded fasteners , and ASTM A370 covers testing for steel bars . However we are not aware of any specific testing requirements for threaded rebar beyond the two standards above . <p> @Gulshan The issue is not the ability to cut threads , the issue is that the rebar dimensions to not lend themselves well to allowing complete threads . You have to go down one thread size in order to form complete threads . For example on #8 rebar , we can only cut 7/8-9 threads because the minor diameter of the bar is less than 1 ? 1-8 threads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not no our knowledge , no . Threading of rebar is quite common , but none of the ASTM standards that cover rebar mention threading , and none of the threaded fastener standards mention rebar . We are not familiar enough with the various ISO standards to know if anything exists there . <p> @Brad Blacketer #18J rebar starts out slightly oversized to allow for it to be turned down to 2-1/44-1/2 . The only rebar grades to normally come this way are #18J and #14J . Other sizes are not oversized and must be turned all the way down to the next smaller size in order to be threaded . 
@@23291088 @3291088/ <h> Hot-Dip Galvanizing vs Zinc Plating <h> How does hot-dip galvanizing differ from electrogalvanizing ? <p> Hot-dip galvanizing is a process of applying a protective zinc coating by dipping product in bath of molten zinc . Galvanizing is a favored method of protective coating due to its low cost , ease of application , and long maintenance-free service life . Generally applied at 830 to 870 degrees , the zinc will bond with the steel . It is the most common outdoor protective coating in use . When used on bolts , due to the thickness of the zinc coating , all galvanized nuts must be tapped oversize . <p> Zinc plating or electroplating is a process where zinc is applied by using a current of electricity . It is a thinner coating than hot dip galvanizing making it unsuitable for outdoor applications . Its advantages are its brightness and uniform color making it more aesthetically appealing . <h> 56 comments <p> Does anyone know about the effectiveness of cadmium plated bolts vrs. galvanizing ? I have an outdoor application that must be protected from corrosion and the structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> @R Elgert- We do n't  have any technical information regarding cadmium plating and its corrosion properties . We can say that zinc plated grade 8 bolts are quite commonly available if those might work for your application . <p> HDG affects the thread tolerance , what type of protection can i use for M52 and M56 grade 8.8 bolts to connect valves flanges in a water pipe line ? Also is that related to the note at table 9 in Bs 4190 . Table 9 " Recommended bolt and nut combinations <p> ( * When a thick protective coating is applied to a bolt of grade 8.8 or 10.9 , which requires the nut thread to be overtapped , the next higher grade of nut should be used . ) <p> @Hardik- We are not familiar with the details of galvanizing automotive parts . You would probably want to check with the part manufacturer and see if they have any recommendations regarding galvanizing or coating . <p> @Sandeep- You would need to talk to the project engineer about any plating substitutions , but normally zinc plating is thinner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied with 80um thickness , 25um is the thickest we are aware of . <p> @Timothy- An accurate test would be to use a coating thickness tester , that can give you the thickness , and you can tell by the thickness which coating it is . Hot dip galvanizing is 2-5 mil ( 0.002 ? to 0.005 ? ) thick , whereas electroplated zinc is less than one mil ( 0.0001 ? ) . Another , but less scientific method would be to try a plain , standard nut on the bolt . If it threads on , then the bolt is electroplated . If not , it is likely galvanized . Hot dip galvanized nuts are tapped oversize to accommodate the thicker coating , so not-tapped oversize nuts should not be able to thread on . <p> I am getting iron railings for indoor stairs . Some of the spindles have a little rust on them ( I had them for a while ) . I want to put good protective coating on the railings . The place that will do the coating offers both Zinc dichromate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be better ? <p> @Ted- For an indoor application , I would n't think it would matter all that much . Once you get the current rust off , if they are indoors they should not continue to rust , and either plating would likely do a sufficient job . <p> Another issue is that there is a possibility of shape distortion due to hot dipping on the sheet metal of the manufactured cabinet . What is the minimum sheet thickness in order not to have any distortion problem ? <p> What is the minimum thickness for hot-dip galvanizing ? We need an outdoor cabinet for about 25 years and do n't  want to renew it . We thought that building it with galvanized sheet metal is meaningless because zink will be gone from the welding points . Is it the best ; hot-dip galvanizing after building the whole cabinet ? <p> @Abdullah- The minimum thickness for hot dip galvanizing of bolts and hardware , which is what we do , is 2.0 mils . For structural members the thickness can vary from 1.4 to 3.9 mils , depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sheet metal , and I am less familiar with what those requirements are . Galvanizing the cabinet after fabrication might be a good idea , but you would need to discuss dimensions and details with your galvanizer and make sure it is within their capabilities . <p> @Khozema- No , hot dip galvanizing is a completely different coating than a zinc chromate . Chromates are simply a sealer on top of the metallic coating , whereas hot dip galvanizing actually bonds with the steel in order to protect it . <p> @Kailas- Hot dip galvanized and swedged anchor bolts are not mutually exclusive you can have both . Additionally , one does n't  have anything to do with the other , Swedging helps to increase the bolts pull out strength in the concrete , whereas hot dip galvanizing is simply a corrosion protection coating that has nothing to do with the strength of the material . <p> I noticed that wedge type expansion anchors can be supplied with what they call a " mechanical galvanized finish , which actually looks just like hot-dipped . What 's the difference ? Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is performed per ASTM B695 , and is tumbled with zinc dust and glass beads in a liquid medium , so the zinc is cold fused onto the steel . Hot dip galvanizing is just that , dipped into hot molten zinc . Hot dip galvanizing is performed per ASTM A153 or F2329 and is a thicker and longer lasting coating . For wedge anchors mechanical galvanizing is more commonly available , although I believe some manufacturers make hot dip galvanized anchors . <p> @Ramsey- Electroplating is a very thin coating ( 0.0003 average ) that will offer limited corrosion protection regardless of the environment . Hot dip galvanizing is roughly 10 times that thick ( approx 0.002 min ) and offers more corrosion protection . We can not make any recommendations for your specific application , but caution should be used with electroplating if corrosion protection is a concern . <p> During Electro Galvanizing of CS fittings why the coating thickness on the outer surface is more than the inner surface. ? Is it not possible to achieve same coating thickness on both outer and inner surfaces ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types . For many grades of bolt , ASTM specifies that the plating types be the same . In addition , nuts for use with HDG bolts are tapped oversize to accommodate the thickness of the zinc . For electro plated nuts , this is not the case , so you could run into thread fit issues . <p> @Mahamuka 85um=3.4 mils . We should be able to get that thickness on our fasteners as an average thickness , but we could not guarantee that there would not be spots that were thinner than 85um . The minimum allowable thickness per F2329 and A153 is 43um=1.7 mils . <p> @Akhilesh I do n't  think electro-zinc will adhere over the top of hot dipped zinc , you might need to contact an electro-plater to see if they have other options that would get you the result you desire . <p> @Rita electro-zinc plating should be on all surfaces of the nut , including the threads . Thicker coatings , like hot dip galvanizing require that the threads be overtapped after coating , so those threads are bare . <p> @Babu I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I would n't think its possible . However , there may be alternative coatings that could be used , however I do n't  have any familiarity with them . Any heating/service life will depend on the coating and you would need to get that information from the coater . <p> @Bill Rush Sheet metal is plated via a continuous feed process , which is a different process than finished parts are put through . The problem you may run into in trying to electro-plate beam , channel , etc is that they may be too large . You will need to contact an electro-plater and find out their length and size restrictions . <p> @Anoop If you use the torque equation T=KDP as explained on our torque page , the friction coefficient for zinc plated bolts is 0.22 vs 0.25 for galvanized . If you plug in this value to the equation , you will get torque values for zinc fasteners that are roughly 12% lower than galvanized fasteners to achieve the same tension . This is an estimate only , the actual numbers can vary . <p> hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thue to the thickness of the zinc coating how much bigger I would have to drill the holes in order to screw the SS 304 bolts ? Typically without galvanizing , If I use a SS 304 3/8 ? 16 UNC bolt then I bore the plate with a 21/64 ? drill in order to tap ( 3/8 ? 16 UNC ) the hole . Thanks for your help.just in this case the thread on the plate is not galvanized . <p> @Ferney- The holes would need to be tapped the same regardless of the coating on the plate . If the hole is tapped after galvanizing , nothing additional would need to be done . However , if the hole is tapped prior to galvanizing , then you would need to chase the holes again with the same tap after the coating has been applied , in order to clean out any zinc buildup in the threads .

@@23291102 @3291102/ <h> Grade 55 Steel Properties <p> The problem with ASTM A108 , 1018CF is that there are no mechanical requirements and typically the test reports that accompany this steel reflect the chemistry only and not the strength of the steel .

The supplier has confirmed that he would supply as per our specification . Now he s coming with substitutions arguing that AISI 1045 or AISI 4140 are superior to ASTM F1554 . Can you please advise if AISI 1045 / 4140 can be substituted for ASTM F1544 . Is this typical of suppliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in several regards . F1554 is a fastener specification that has specific chemical and mechanical properties that are tailored to perform in anchor bolt applications . AISI 1045 and 4140 are both chemical-only steel grades that are designed to be heat treated and can be used for varying applications . Both 1045 and 4140 in their as-rolled ( that is , non-heat treated ) condition do not have mechanical properties typically reported on their material certifications , but the typical properties if they were to be tested would fall outside the parameters specified by ASTM F1554 . AISI 1045 and 4140 would typically have strengths above the maximum allowed for F1554 Grade 55 , but below the minimum for F1554 Grade 105 . Additionally , 1045 and 4140 would not have the ductility ( elongation and reduction of area ) required by F1554 . <p> F1554 Grade 55 , as supplied by Portland Bolt , is a low carbon , high alloy steel that we have manufactured to our exacting specifications . Additionally , Portland Bolt 's F1554 Grade 55 also conforms to supplement S1 , which specifies weldable steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades of heat treated steel , of which 4140 is the most common . The F1554 specification requires that Grade 105 be made from heat treated steel , so your off-the-shelf warehouse grade 4140 is unlikely to meet it . Additionally the F1554 Grade 105 supplied by Portland Bolt will come with the Charpy test per supplemental requirement S5 , ensuring low temperature ductility . <p> To answer your question as to whether or not this is typical of suppliers , the answer is unfortunately too often , yes . Many suppliers who do not understand the F1554 specification will try to substitute other grades in order to get the order . This is a dangerous practice because they do not fully comprehend the reasons for specifying the F1554 grades in the first place . Welding , cold temperatures , ductility , and a maximum tensile strength are all crucial reasons for supplying the correct grade as specified by the design engineer . Portland Bolt supplies both F1554 Grade 55 and 105 in full compliance with ASTM , and mill test reports are always available , both in paper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anchor bolt grade is n't available or they are going " substitute " stronger material . <p> @MIGUEL FRANKLIN : Yes , ASTM F1554 is designed specifically for anchor bolts . Engineers are moving towards using this standard as the default anchor bolt specification . A449 with a minimum yield of 58-92 ksi ( depending on diameter ) , is between grade 55 and grade 105 in strength . So this would need to be taken into consideration when designing foundations . <p> I 'm aware of Departments of Transportation agencies that are changing standard specifications from A449 to F1554 . We see a trend towards F1554 becoming the primary anchor bolt specification of choice . <p> Additionally , the F1554G55 material that Portland Bolt stocks is melted and rolled in such a way that it is capable of passing the Charpy V-Notch impact test that is sometimes specified as a supplementary requirement to the F1554 specification .

For example , - ASTM A307 , which covers low carbon general purpose bolts and studs , has the following sections detailing bolt specifics : <p> Section 1.3 , suitable nuts <p> Section 7.1 , thread geometry <p> Section 7.2 , head dimensions , thread length , other bolt dimensions <p> Section 7.3 , nut over-tapping allowances for hot dip galvanized bolts <p> Section 9 , test methods <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every mundane aspect of the fastener would need to be discussed and decided between the purchaser and the manufacturer , or assumptions would need to be made that may or may not meet the needs of the application the bolts are being used in . <p> ASTM A36 addresses this in the ASTM standard by including an appurtenant material chart. - What this chart says is that if bolts are called out as A36 , since A36 does not specifically cover bolts , then they should instead conform to the grade listed in the chart . <p> Below from Section 3.1 and Table 1 of A36 : <p> When components of a steel structure are identified with this ASTM designation , but the product form is not listed in the scope of this specification , the material shall conform to one of the standards listed below unless otherwise specified by the purchaser . <p> This is not to say that the materials listed above conform to or can be made from A36 steel " in many cases they can not simply that if the purchaser calls out a product per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above scope ( shapes , bars , plates ) , the manufacturer or supplier can supply product conforming to the above standards . For example , say someone requests A36 anchor bolts. - According to this chart , those anchor bolts should be instead furnished to ASTM F1554 Grade 36. - ASTM F1554 grade 36 anchor bolts are typically made from A36 or some similar low carbon raw steel , however care must be taken to make sure all the requirements of F1554 are met. - Most off the floor A36 is missing the reduction of area ( RA% ) measurement , required by F1554 , but not by A36. - Additional testing may need to be performed. - If , per the above chart , the anchor bolts are made per F1554 , the threads , grade marking , compatible nuts , and most every other aspect and detail of the anchor bolts is already called out , saving time for both parties buy not requiring a lengthy discussion of the details , unless modifications or variances are necessary . <p> Portland Bolt is happy to answer questions like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel free to use us as a resource . <p> @Daizy- those materials are similar , but not exactly the same . You would need to compare the material test reports with the ASTM requirements to make sure they are within the parameters of the standards . <p> @Nithees- A36 is a low carbon , low strength steel and is not an equivalent to A325 . A325 is a heat treated , high strength structural bolt . If you substitute it would most certainly run the risk of causing a failure . <p> @Malcome Both A307 and grade 5 are fastener standards , so bolts can be ordered per either grade . They differ from A36 in that A36 is a raw material/steel specification and A307/grade 5 are fastener specifications . <p> @Fayad No , there are no marking requirements for A36 material , hence the problem ordering bolts to raw material specifications . You will need to contact the manufacturer of the bolts to ascertain specifics about the bolts in question .

B7 bolts . <p> You are correct that none of those publications specifically pair a grade of nut with a grade of bolt , leaving it open to a bit of interpretation . The reason that A194 grade 2H nuts are used more often with A193 grade B7 bolts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 nuts have the same minimum mechanical requirements , they differ only in chemistry. - The industry has chosen 2H nuts to be the primary nut for B7 bolts , as well as allows them to be substituted for A563 grade C and DH nuts for use with ASTM A325 and A490 structural bolts . The result is that , in addition to be a less costly nut to manufacture , they are much more widely mass produced , leading to economies of scale . That said , there is no reason that a specific engineer can not require grade 7 nuts on a particular job if he feels that they will perform better in that application . The cost will be higher and the lead time may be slower due to availability , but the A194 grade 7 nuts would be acceptable for use with A193 B7 bolts or studs . <h> 5 comments <p> Hello Mr.Dane , For the valve applications , can we use these A 193 B7 &amp; A 194 2H bolt-nut combinations . kindly note that our valves are of alloy steel material ( F22/C21A/F91 ) and temperature is &lt;550 Deg.C

@@23291128 @3291128/ <h> Fastener Substitution Liability <h> What are the liability issues involved in substituting one fastener grade or configuration for another ? <p> Have you ever had a fastener company try and talk you into substituting A193 grade B7 all thread rod for F1554 grade 55 anchor rods , claiming its " better ? " Have you allowed them to substitute an all thread rod with a nut tack welded in lieu of a headed bolt ? These are scenarios that come up quite often in the fastener world . If you have allowed any type of grade or product substitution without an engineers approval , you may have opened a can of worms and exposed your company to a tremendous amount of liability . Worried ? You probably should be . <h> Why do fastener salespeople try to substitute products ? <p> Before we explore why these and other types of substitutions are often unacceptable , let 's take a step back and figure out why salespeople are so anxious to substitute one product for another . Whether you 're selling bolts , shoes , or cars , any Sales 101 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customer is looking for , substitute something else before that customer has a chance to buy what they really want from your competitor . Trying to sell a customer a pair of Nike running shoes instead of the Adidas they preferred because you were out of stock in their size has no potential liability issue attached . Salespeople , especially commissioned ones , simply want to close the sale regardless of whether or not you end up with what you need . However , shoes do n't  hold up bridges , support high-rise buildings , or secure light poles to their foundations . Allowing a salesman to substitute a different grade or configuration of fastener that an engineer has specified , could have catastrophic implications . <h> Most fastener companies do not employ engineers . <p> Most fastener companies , whether they are a manufacturer like Portland Bolt or a distributor who simply buys and resells standard fasteners , do not employ structural engineers who are qualified to recommend substituting anything other than the exact grade and configuration of product that was originally specified . Engineers identify a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of factors that include strength , ductility , configuration , thread pitch , corrosion resistance , etc . <h> Limited or no manufacturing capabilities . <p> To further understand why bolt salespeople attempt to sell you a different grade or configuration of product than you actually need requires a deeper understanding of the types of companies that comprise the fastener industry . Let 's start with bolt manufacturers . Portland Bolt is a manufacturer of nonstandard anchor bolts and construction fasteners . Our manufacturing capabilities are extremely broad and encompass headed bolts through 2-1/2 ? diameter , bent bolts through 4-1/2 ? diameter , and threaded rods through 6 ? diameter . We inventory just under one million pounds of round bar that will allow us to manufacture to virtually any ASTM bolt specification . On the other end of the spectrum are fastener distributors . These companies buy and resell mass produced and imported fasteners in addition to wrenches , ladders , tools , hard hats , and other construction related equipment . They have no manufacturing capabilities whatsoever . Somewhere in the middle of manufacturers and distributors lie hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing capabilities . Perhaps they thread mild steel round bar , but do n't  have the ability to forge headed bolts or thread high strength round bar . If you do n't  know the manufacturing capabilities of your primary fastener supplier you should ask . <p> With a better understanding of the industry it is easy to see that companies who do not have access to specific grades of steel or who do not have the ability to manufacture specific types of fasteners will undoubtedly attempt to pass off a different grade or style of fastener that they claim is " equal or better " than the grade or type of fastener that has been specified on your project . In this economy , desperation to consummate a sale may result in a salesperson attempting to substitute just about anything . If you take their word as gospel , you could be exposing your company to a tremendous amount of liability . Do you really want to gamble that a person who has been selling fasteners for six months really knows if the bolt they are passing off as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have devastating legal implications . <h> Product liability insurance what 's that ? <p> Ever asked your primary bolt supplier how much product liability insurance they carry ? What if they suggest a substitution that gets rejectedworse yet .. after installation ? What now ? Well they will certainly step up and replace the product , pay for the cost of labor to remove and reinstall the correct fasteners that should have been supplied in the first place , and cover any back charges.wont they ? Do n't  be so sure . Next time you talk with them you might find out if they carry enough insurance to fix their mistake . You might discover you 'll be on your own . <h> Common misconceptions . <p> Let 's look at the two most common misconceptions in the fastener industry . <p> Misconception #1 " Stronger is always better . <p> In the fastener industry , stronger is NOT always better . An engineer may have wanted a certain combination of strength and ductility that a particular fastener specification offers . Substituting a stronger fastener results in a reduction in ductility which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we used an example of the common practice of substituting A193 grade B7 for F1554 grade 55 anchor rods ( or just about any other ASTM specification for that matter ) . A193 grade B7 all thread rod is a high strength material that will exceed the strength of many other ASTM specifications . The tantalizing thing about B7 rod is that virtually every fastener company in the country stocks it . It is a quick fix for just about any situation due to its relatively low cost and immediate availability . However , B7 does n't  meet the requirements of F1554 grade 55 due to the fact that F1554 grade 55 has a maximum tensile strength requirement of 95ksi that A193 grade B7 will always exceed ( 125 ksi minimum ) . In essence , B7 is too strong to meet the requirements of F1554 grade 55 . There is a good chance that the engineer specifying the fasteners wanted the combination of strength , ductility , and possibility weldability that F1554 grade 55 provides . <p> Misconception #2 " Threaded rod with a nut tack welded can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are a purchasing agent , project manager , superintendent , or in any other role that empowers you to procure fasteners for your company , you have a tremendous responsibility to your organization to purchase the exact product that has been specified on your project . If you allow a fastener company to sell you an alternate product they claim will be an acceptable substitute , it is your responsibility to make sure that product will work for your application . If you do n't  , you may be opening a can of worms . <h> 2 comments <p> Gentlemen , thank you for your continued efforts to lift the fog from manufacturing and construction eyes who , through no ones fault , would otherwise be totally out to lunch on Headed bolts .

If they are , then it is a non-issue . If they are not , you 'll need to decide if they are acceptable . It also sounds like someone is trying to dual-certify bolts by marking them both A307 and AB36 . Theoretically there is nothing wrong with that , but per the F1554 standard , if they are marked , they are supposed to be marked on the end that projects from the concrete . If marking not required ( it is a supplemental requirement ) , then the bolts should be painted blue on the projection end .

Heat treatment and testing will also be required in order to achieve the needed mechanical requirements . <p> @Rechelle- It might . A307 has some chemical and mechanical requirements that might be met by AISI 1020 , but you 'd have to look at the testing paperwork to see if it meets .

I am a plater and have been requested to strip and re-plate this material in a ROHS approved zinc and passivate coating and am concerned on whether or not it requires a bake for embrittlement relief . The new ASTM F1941-15 standard for fasteners does not require a bake for anything under Rc39 however if &gt; than Rc 39 then a 14 hour bake is required between 375 and 400 deg .

Just because they are imported does not mean they are not of high quality . That said , I cant say where the ones you are finding were made , and there are likely some bad ones out there as well . If quality is a concern , I 'd make sure that the bolts come with test reports , that way you can be reasonably sure that they are manufactured and tested per ASTM standards . <p> @Bhavin- There some chemical and mechanical similarities between the two , but they are not identical bolts .

A325 bolts are widely available in the marketplace , and should be off the shelf at just about any fastener supplier . If there is something about your needs , whether size , configuration , etc , that is causing you trouble , then I might be able to offer some guidance . <p> @Hugh You would need to get approval from the project engineer to make this substitution .

Class 10.9s nearest match is A490 . Now the question can we pretension it to the same level as A490 ?

You want want to contact a structural engineer to see if he can approve the substitution . <p> @Naveed Ahmed torque is an imprecise way to measure tension , and with all the variables that need to be accounted for , there are no real accurate tolerances published . The best way to determine the proper torque is to do lab testing . <p> We had a request from a customer for a bolt he called a " Super Bolt " or " Torque Bolt " .

The most similar specification to A325 that can be used for anchor bolts is ASTM A449 . A449 can be made from a number of different steels , AISI 4140 being among them , but the anchor bolt must be heat treated , tested , and stamped per the requirements of A449 . Simply substituting AISI 4140 steel will not meet the requirements of the specification . <p> By specification , A325 bolts are designed with sufficient ductility to pretension into the inelastic range . In contrast SAE bolts should only be pretensioned within the elastic range , and the amount of pretension is left to the joint designer . <p> If you have a structural joint that requires pretension by design then you must use 325 or 490 bolts since they are the only ones for which a pretension specification exists . <p> In my opinion then you might get away with using an A325 bolt in a Grade 5 application ( bearing in mind thread pitch and tolerance issues ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an A325 ( structural ) application unless you can also , in consultation with the engineer of record , provide the installer with a pretension specification . <p> @Adriana Landberg : Although ASTM A325 and SAE J429 Grade 5 are covered by two different specifying entities ( ASTM vs . SAE ) , they are virtually identical in chemistry and strength . The difference is in their configuration and application . The American Society for Testing and Materials ( ASTM ) covers fasteners for construction applications , while the Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE ) covers fasteners for automotive , equipment , and OEM type applications . Due to their nature , SAE fasteners are cap screw quality and are dimensionally more precise than ASTM machine bolts . As I stated earlier , the chemical and mechanical requirements of A325 and grade 5 bolts are virtually identical . A325 bolts have a heavy hex head while grade 5 cap screws have a finished ( standard size ) hex head . A325 bolts are designed for structural steel connections and therefore , have a shorter thread length than grade 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar . <p> eduardo rodriguez + We do not supply SAE bolts , but SAE J429 grade 7 has a minimum tensile strength of 133ksi while an ASTM A394-T1 has a minimum tensile strength requirement of 120ksi . Therefore , the A394 bolts may be slightly weaker than the SAE grade 7 bolts . Even though the grade 7 bolts are stronger , we would not recommend making this substitution without consulting a structural engineer .

What are the lengths these rods come in , the availability of each grade , and cost differences ? <p> Most ASTM standards address the recommended application of the fastener . There are often two or three different ASTM specifications with similar chemical and mechanical properties , but with differing applications . ASTM F1554 is a specification that is designed for anchor bolts embedded in concrete . Since your application is for tie rod assemblies , it would appear that technically , you should select a different specification with similar properties to the F1554 grade 105 specification . In this case , you should consider using ASTM A354 grade BC which is virtually identical to F1554 grade 105 both chemically and mechanically , but is not limited by its application . For a strength comparison of these two grades refer to our strength by grade chart . <p> Chemically , we manufacture both grades of fastener using the same medium carbon alloy steel ( 4140 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical with only subtle differences . F1554 grade 105 has a 105,000 pounds per square inch ( psi ) minimum yield strength while A354 grade BC has a minimum yield requirement of 109 ksi . The minimum tensile strength requirement of both grades is identical at 125 ksi with F1554 grade 105 also possessing a maximum requirement of 150 ksi .

However , any aspect of a given specification can be altered provided there is complete understanding and agreement on what changes are being made to a given specification . For example , let 's say in this application that you wanted to use the A354 grade BC specification due to the application instead of F1554 grade 105 , but it was critical that the tensile strength not exceed 150 ksi as is the case with the F1554 grade 105 specification .

@@23291204 @3291204/ <h> External Thread Summary <h> What is the meaning of thread pitch , major diameter , minor diameter , crest , root , flanks , angle , and run-out in the context of external thread ? <p> Portland Bolt forms threads using two methods : cut threading and roll threading . Cut threading is a process that removes steel to form the threads . The roll threading method we utilize starts with reduced body pitch diameter steel . To make a one inch bolt we would use .912 inch round bar . This steel is forced between two dies and the steel is extruded to form the threads . <p> Even though finished threads from either method function similarly , it would be difficult for an untrained eye to tell visually the differences . Cut threads are formed to UN ( Unified National ) and rolled threads are made to UNR ( Unified National Radius ) standards . According to the IFI ( 2003 , A-33 ) abstract of ASME B1.1 2002 , " the difference between UN and UNR threads in addition to designation is that a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while only a rounded root contour is specified for UNR threads . " In most cases cut threads will have a flat thread crest ( top portion ) and rolled threads will have rounded crest . Typical construction fasteners are designed to coarse thread series ( UNC/UNRC ) . <p> Thread Terminology According to IFI ( 2003 , A-33 ) pitch diameter is , " the diameter of a theoretical cylinder that passes through the threads in such a position that the widths of the thread ridges and the grooves are equal . On a perfect thread these widths would each equal one-half of the thread pitch . " <p> The thread pitch is the distance , measured parallel to its axis , between corresponding points on adjacent surfaces , in the same axial plane . For unified threads , thread pitch is the reciprocal of threads per inch ( TPI ) . <p> The major diameter of a thread is the distance that touches the crest of an external thread . <p> The minor diameter ( root diameter ) is the diameter of a cylinder that just touches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thread is the top portion of a thread . <p> The root is the lowest groove between the two flanks of the thread . <p> The flanks of a thread are the sides that connect the crest and the root . <p> The angle of a thread is the angle between the flanks , measured in an axial plane section . <p> The thread run-out describes the end of the threaded portion which is not cut or rolled to the full depth and provides a transition to bolt shank . This is only a basic summary of the main characteristics of external threads . For more in-depth explanation see ASME B1.1 or Inch Fastener Standards from IFI ( Screw Threads , 2003 , Section A ) for detailed description of threaded mechanical fasteners. 
@@23291205 @3291205/ <h> F1554 Grade 36 All Thread Rod <p> In almost all cases , commercially available all thread rod will not meet F1554 grade 36 . First , it is rare that distributors or manufacturers keep lot control on all thread rod . In other words , different heats of all thread rod are commingled so that it is difficult to determine the exact certification document that corresponds to any particular rod . Second , there is usually no traceability associated with stock all thread rod to begin with . It is frequently bought and sold without certification . Third , if mill test reports do accompany the all thread rod , they usually lack a Reduction of Area value which is necessary to determine whether the threaded rod will meet F1554 grade 36 . When tested in a finished condition , it is rare that the Reduction of Area value will fall within the guidelines of the specification . Additionally , the Elongation requirement will rarely be met and often the Maximum Tensile Strength requirement will be exceeded . <p> What causes these issues associated with Reduction of Area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rod , typically it is for the A36 raw material ( or other mild steel ) used to manufacture the finished product . This is often why there is no Reduction of Area value provided since A36 raw material has no Reduction of Area requirement . A36 raw material , if tested , will typically meet the Reduction of Area and all other requirements of the F1554 grade 36 specification . When the all thread rod in its finished form is tested , it rarely will meet the Reduction of Area requirement . Why is this ? Typically the A36 raw material is roll threaded and often cold drawn from a larger diameter prior to threading . These processes result in a work hardening of the steel and create a finished product that is higher in strength and is less ductile than the raw material . Consequently , when the fully threaded rod is tested in its finished condition , the Reduction of Area value does not fall within the guidelines of F1554 grade 36 . Additionally , the Elongation and Tensile Strength requirements may not be met . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameters that meets the requirements of F1554 grade 36 .

However , it needs to be cut thread from scratch or " off the shelf " all thread rod needs to be annealed in order to soften it so that the Reduction of Area , Elongation , and Tensile Strength requirements are met . Another option when F1554 grade 36 is specified would be to substitute F1554 grade 55 all thread rod . Section 4.1 of the ASTM specification states , " When Grade 36 is specified , a weldable Grade 55 may be furnished at the suppliers option .

@@23291208 @3291208/ <h> Concerns Calculating Torque <h> How do I calculate torque for construction fasteners ? <p> Torque is a difficult value to calculate accurately , especially for construction fasteners and should be used cautiously . The primary challenge is accounting for environmental factors , coatings , and a number of other variables including surface texture , material hardness , and thread series . In most situations , it is challenging to give reliable allowable torque values for bolted assemblies . For the most accurate data we recommend field testing the intended assemblies using a calibrated torque wrench and a Skidmore-Wilhelm load indicating device to equate actual torque to the desired tension . <p> The theoretical torque values listed on our site are intended as reference point . This chart only covers products with a published friction coefficient . <p> because of the continuous tightening and loosening of anchor bolt of my motor the thread of one leg got worn out . I did file to reduce the size of the bolt to its next near value and created a new thread of standard nearer value . Now I need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could you please tell me how to calculate the torque for this ? I have data sheet of the anchor bolt provided by my supplier but he says he can not provide me the value for the reduced thread . <p> I have heard a debate about torque being lost with the use of an extension bar . Example if I set my torque wrench to 50 ft lbs and use a foot long extension between the wrench and the socket , the applied torque will be less at the socket than if the socket were directly mounted to the wrench . Can you end this debate ? <p> @Wayne- Torque is measured in foot-lbs , so the addition of an extension will make the wrench easier to turn , but shouldnt effect the torque at the bolt head or nut . For example , if you are using a one foot long wrench , you would need to exert 50lbs of force to achieve 50ft-lbs of torque . If your wrench is two feet long , you would only need to exert 25lbs of force to achieve 50ft-lbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length of the wrench is divided out . <p> @Jacques There is no torque requirement for A325s , unless your engineer has specified one for this particular job . Normally what is desired is tension , and the tension for A325s is recommended to be 28,000-34,000lbs ( 28-34kips ) . You can derive the torque needed to achieve that tension , but the only sure fire way to do that is to do some field testing in a Skidmore-Whilhelm tension measuring device . Short of that , you are only guessing . <p> @Zeeshan The FAQs we have on our website really explain it as well as we can . Torque is a tricky subject , and the variables with regards to friction and material make it hard to give any one standard answer .

@@23291234 @3291234/ <h> ASTM A325 Anchor Bolts <h> Can ASTM A325 grade be used as anchor bolts ? <p> We often sell A325 heavy hex bolts as anchor bolts , but technically they are supposed to be used for structural steel connections only . Part of the problem is that the A325 specification is very specific as to the application and thread length . Because A325 bolts are typically used in structural steel connections , they have very short thread lengths . Often this thread length restriction is too short when the bolts are used as anchor bolts . The A325 specification recommends switching to A449 when being used as an anchor bolt . ASTM A449 is virtually identical in chemistry and strength , but can have longer thread length and is not restricted by the application . When engineers do specify A325 heavy hex bolts to be used as anchor bolts , we will typically extend the thread length ( in agreement with the customer ) beyond what the specification calls for . We also frequently see bent anchor bolts and straight anchor rods with anchor plates ordered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heavy hex structural bolts only , once again ASTM A449 should be considered in lieu of A325 . AISC also discusses what ASTM specifications should be used as anchor bolts . <h> 6 comments <p> This basically means you can use A449 bolts for any application . It is not restricted to a specific type of bolt ( heavy hex head ) or thread length ( as with A325 bolts ) . Some specifications such as A325 ( heavy hex structural bolt ) , F1554 ( anchor bolts ) , and A193 ( high temperature or high pressure service ) have very specific uses and configurations as outlined in the ASTM specification . <p> In reference to this comment , " ASTM A449 is virtually identical in chemistry and strength , but can have longer thread length and is not restricted by the application . " why is it not restricted by the application ? Is this due to the longer thread length ? Thanks for any info you can offer ! <p> In my opinion for anchor bolt we should restrict ourselves upto either ASTM A 307 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to concret failure . Higher strength bolt will require quite stringent tensile requirement of concrete in effective concret cone ( resistant against pull out , cone ) which depends upon embedment depth , edge distance , center to center of bolt . <p> @Dave ASTM A449 does not have any advantages or disadvantages versus F1554 as an anchor bolt specification.it simply has different characteristics . There are three grades of F1554 anchor bolts . Grade 36 is manufactured from mild steel and has a minimum yield strength of 36ksi . Grade 55 is a modified mild steel that has a 55 ksi minimum yield requirement . Grade 105 is a medium carbon alloy ( often 4140 ) that undergoes a heat treating process and requires a minimum yield strength of 105 ksi . <p> Whereas F1554 is applicable only to anchor bolts , A449 is not specific to anchor bolts but can certainly be used as an anchor bolt specification ( whereas A325 can not ) .

@@23291235 @3291235/ <h> Rod vs Headed Anchor Bolt <h> Can I substitute a rod with a nut for a headed anchor bolt ? <p> Thank you for the opportunity to quote on your requirement for headed anchor bolts . I noticed you have approved the substitution of a rod in lieu of a bolt with a forged head . We do not recommend allowing this type of substitution without approval from the engineer . <p> Based on performing mechanical tests to the ASTM specification F606 which covers the testing of construction fasteners , a rod with a nut would simply not produce the same strength characteristics as a bolt with a forged head . Under F606 , headed bolts are pulled until they break , providing minimum tensile and yield strengths for the given fastener . In order for a bolt to meet an ASTM specification , the strength of the tested bolt must exceed the minimum requirements of the specification . <p> For a headed bolt , an angled wedge ( from 4- 10- based on diameter ) is inserted under the head of the bolt . This wedge puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled to failure . This insures that the forging has been done in such a manner that the junction of the head and the shank of the bolt is not the weak point . For this reason , the ASTM F606 specification also stipulates that when the bolt breaks during testing , it can break only in the threads or the shank of the bolt , not at the junction of the head . If a bolt were to break under the head during testing , this constitutes a failure , even if it develops enough strength to exceed the minimum requirements of the specification . <p> When a rod with a nut is substituted for a bolt with a forged head , two issues come into play with regard to the ASTM F606 testing . First , in the in-house mechanical testing that we have performed on a headed bolt versus a rod with a nut , both from the identical lot of steel , the rod with a nut develops about 20% less strength than the comparable headed bolt . The reason for this reduction in strength on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the junction of the rod and nut ( which is substituting for the bolt head ) is significantly reduced . Because the minor diameter ( valley ) of the threads is significantly less than the full size diameter of the shank on a headed bolt , the rod with nut option breaks at a much lower strength than a headed bolt . More importantly , even if the rod with nut does develop enough strength to meet the specification , it will always break at the junction of the nut which is acting as the head of the bolt . For this reason , technically a rod with nut in lieu of a headed bolt will always fail the ASTM F606 mechanical test because the head ( nut in this case ) comes off before the bolt breaks in the body or threaded section . <p> The reason that many fastener distributors and manufacturers with limited capabilities encourage the substitution of a rod with nut in lieu of a headed bolt is because they simply do not have the capability to forge heads onto bolts . They also do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that such a substitution would compromise the strength and integrity of the fastener . When an engineer designs a project using headed bolts , their calculations are based on those of a bolt with a forged head , not a nut with rod that will not develop the same strength as a headed bolt . Our recommendation is that should you authorize such a substitution , that you do it only with the engineer 's approval .

@@23291266 @3291266/ <h> Proof vs . Yield Strength <h> What is proof strength of a bolt and how it is different from yield strength ? <p> Proof strength , or proof load , is the full size equivalent of a yield test . Yield testing is typically only performed on machined specimens . In most fastener standards , full size testing is the preferred method , and the referee method if there is a discrepancy between the two test results . <p> Because of the difficulty of getting reliable test results for yield when testing full size fasteners , the proof load test was developed as an alternative . In a proof load test , a headed bolt is placed in a testing machine with a nut on the threaded end , and a wedge under the head . The wedge varies from 4-10 degrees depending on the size and configuration of fastener , and serves to evaluate the ductility of the bolt . In a machine specimen test , you test ductility by measuring elongation and reduction of area , but those are impossible during a full size test , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load testing is typically performed at 90-93% of the expected minimum yield strength and is a simple pass/fail test .

@@23291267 @3291267/ <h> Class 1 vs 2 Stainless <h> Is there a way to visually distinguish the difference between a Class 1 and Class 2 stainless steel bolt ? <p> Yes there is . A193 and A320 grades B8 and B8M are assumed to be Class 1 unless otherwise specified. - Class 1 fasteners are carbon solution treated , while class 2 fasteners are carbide solution treated and strain hardened. - The work hardening that occurs in the manufacturing of Class 2 fasteners increases their strength . Class 2 fasteners are differentiated by a line under the grade symbol which appears on the heads of bolts or the ends of threaded rods . <p> @David- A193 B8 Class 2 would be closer in strength to A325 than class 1 , but it is not identical ( it varies by diameter ) . Additionally , galling can often be an issue for stainless steel , especially in high tension applications , so caution should be exercised when substituting . <p> Hi , through visual inspection is it possible to segregate A193 B8 Cl1 from A320 B8 Cl1 ? The same question for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cl2 from A320 B8M Cl2 . Our concern is that for a certain material class both A320 &amp; A193 have got similar grade marking and to avoid any confusion at job site please advise how we can distinguish A193 &amp; A320 ( same class ) . Thanks for your insight and guidelines . <p> @Shahram- The reason that the head markings for the above grades of A193 and A320 are the same is that the bolts are 100% identical . They are made from the same steel , and to the same mechanical properties . There is no need to segregate , as all the bolts will meet the requirements of both A193 and A320 . <p> We have 5/8 SS studs stamped with B8M however it is not underlined . Speaking to the suppliers ( Australia ) they have said ( ASSUMED ) that all class B8M studs are class 2 because class 1 is pretty much just a standard stainless rod and no one uses them . The Australian standard does n't  specify the requirement for markings on bolts and requires the manufacturers specifications to be followed which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Class 2 B8M being written without the underline ? <p> @Tom- No , all B8M studs are not class 2 . Class 1 is by far the more common of the two . Class 2 are strain hardened and much less common/more expensive . The old requirement for class 2 was for a simple underline , but as of a couple years ago , the marking mas changed to B8MSH with an underline . If your product is nor marked properly , I 'd say it does nor meet the standard for class 2 . <p> @Noya- ASTM A193 B8M class 2 is stronger , but slightly less ductile than class 1 . I would n't think the substitution should be cause for alarm , but to be sure , the project engineer should be asked to approve it . <p> The allowable stress value is not mensioned about B8M Cl.2 for temperature . over 750 F in Table A-10 , ASME B31.1 . It is regarded that the Cl.2 is not recommended to use for high temperature . If you want to use those bolts , youd better to check the service temperature . 
@@23291268 @3291268/ <h> March 2016 <p> Threads of a fastener are produced through one of two processes , cutting or rolling . Previously , we produced a roll threading video which shows threads being formed by " rolling " round bar between two threading dies which displaces the steel to form the threads . Although roll threading is extremely efficient , it is limited by the length of thread , strength of the steel , and diameter of the parts . Cut threading is a process in which round bar is fed into rotating threading chasers that " cut " the threads into the round bar .

Altering the head geometry and/or thread lengths of these specifications is now acceptable under the Supplementary Requirement S2 of F3125 , and will now be indicated with the letter " S " for " special " following the A325 or A490 grade symbol on the head of the bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for F3125 Grade A325 bolts are the same from -+ " 1-+ " diameters .

@@23291310 @3291310/ <h> Manufacturers vs Distributors <h> What is the difference between a bolt manufacturer and a fastener distributor ? <p> In the fastener industry , there are two different types of fastener companies distributors and manufacturers . The following FAQ will address the differences between fastener distributors and bolt manufacturers and provide some insight as to when to consider utilizing each type of company for your fastener purchases . <h> What is a fastener distributor ? <p> Fastener distributors serve a very important role in the fastener industry . Distributors buy and resell product that is readily available in the marketplace . These items are typically smaller sized fasteners that are mass produced either overseas or in some cases the United States . Distributors provide both SAE fasteners ( grades 2 , 5 and 8&amp;#41 for use in equipment , automotive , and OEM type applications as well as ASTM fasteners more commonly used in construction . For a distributor to stock a specific fastener , they must sell it on a repetitive basis frequently enough to justify inventorying that item . Products that are commonly stocked by distributors include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood screws , rivets , wedge anchors , all thread rod , nuts , washers , etc . These items are used frequently enough for a distributor to carry a full size range of these items . <p> In addition to brokering bolts , fastener distributors will often sell construction supplies that include items like hand tools , drill bits , wrenches , hard hats , ladders , buckets , etc . Fastener distributors will perform tasks like running small orders to job sites several times a week and filling bolt bins on a regular schedule . <p> In addition to selling standard sized bolts , fastener distributors will also broker nonstandard fasteners by buying product from manufacturers and reselling it to end users such as original equipment manufacturers , contractors , steel fabricators , and other construction related companies . <h> Where do the standard bolts sold by distributors come from ? <p> Most of the standard sized imported construction fasteners sold by distributors come from Asia or India and are sold through two or three wholesalers who directly import them . Structural bolts and a limited amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies and sold through an established supply chain . <h> What does Portland Bolt do ? <p> Portland Bolt is a manufacturer of large , nonstandard anchor bolts and construction fasteners . We make bolts in sizes and grades that are not mass produced or imported from overseas . <h> What is a bolt manufacturer ? <p> Unlike fastener distributors , bolt manufacturers like Portland Bolt specialize in producing fasteners that are not readily available in the marketplace . These are bolts that are specifically engineered into a structure and do not meet the dimensional , chemical , and mechanical properties that would commonly be found sitting on the shelf of a fastener distributor . Typically , nonstandard construction fasteners are large in diameter , longer in length , or higher in strength than common , mass produced fasteners . Companies like Portland Bolt who specialize in manufacturing bolts that are not in stock , have specialized equipment designed to take steel round bar and cut it , thread it , forge a head onto it , bend it , or otherwise process it and turn it into a finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and end-users or just through distribution ? <p> Portland Bolt sells product to both contractors , OEMs , and other construction related companies as well as to fastener distributors . Some bolt manufacturers will not sell directly to end users , and choose to provide their products only to fastener distributors who then broker these items to the end users . <p> Portland Bolts philosophy is to determine the cost for us to manufacture the requested fastener , apply a reasonable profit margin , and sell it at the same price to whoever wants to purchase it from us . Although we value our relationships with the many fastener distributors we work with , we do not provide them with discounted pricing or preferential costs . We feel that allowing contractors and construction related companies to buy directly from us will insure the best pricing and a direct line of communication that reduces the chance for error . <p> No . Many fastener manufacturers have extremely limited manufacturing capabilities and only work with low carbon steel . Only one other construction fastener manufacturer that we know of in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a " rod shop " ? <p> A " rod shop " is industry slang for a bolt manufacturing company whose manufacturing capabilities are limited to cutting and threading only . Some rod shops will also have the ability to bend small anchor bolts and u-bolts . These companies are often characterized by limitations that include relatively small diameters and lower strength materials only . Rod shops often do not provide high strength , heat-treated materials , large diameters , and certainly do not have the ability to make headed bolts . <h> Hybrids <p> The distinction between bolt manufacturers and fastener distributors is not cut and dried and is often blurred by hybrid fastener companies . Hybrids are companies that have some manufacturing capabilities but also stock and distribute a complete line of standard fasteners and construction supplies . For example , many rod shops with limited manufacturing capabilities will emphasize the distribution of a full line of fasteners and construction supplies . In fact , Portland Bolt stocks some common construction fasteners including items such as A325 structural bolts , lag screws , hex bolts , carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , most companies either emphasize distribution or manufacturing of nonstandard fasteners . <h> Should I buy all my fasteners from a manufacturer or a distributor ? <p> If you can find a competent distributor who can provide your regular bolts as well as your custom fasteners , or if you can find a competent manufacturer who is willing to service your everyday needs , you can probably get away with using one company . However , most contractors and construction related companies who buy fasteners on a regular basis choose to buy their standard fasteners from a distributor and work directly with a manufacturer for their nonstandard bolt needs . <h> How do I know if my regular fastener supplier is a manufacturer or a distributor ? <p> Many companies who buy bolts do n't  have a complete understanding of their fastener suppliers full capabilities . The best thing to do is ask them . Find out what manufacturing capabilities they have , if any . Find out what items they inventory . Distributors or companies with limited capabilities may attempt to avoid these questions . Visit their facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturer " distributor spectrum . This will give you a better idea as to when you should be contacting them and for what type(s) of fastener . <h> The illusion created by the internet . <p> The internet is a great marketing tool , but can be used by some companies to create a false illusion that they have different capabilities than they actually possess . We have seen numerous companies , through pictures and statements on their website , lead their existing customers and prospects to believe they have the ability to produce headed bolts when in fact they are really only a rod shop . Another company who is essentially a single person operation and works from their house in a residential area , has created an illusion that they own a complex network of manufacturing facilities throughout the country , when in fact those companies simply sell him bolts that he brokers . <h> How do I know whether the bolt I need is a standard item or if it will need to be manufactured ? <p> Lead time . For companies that do n't  buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult things to do is to look at a list of fasteners and determine which ones will be a standard stock item and which will need to be custom manufactured . If you call your local fastener distributor and they tell you it will take them more than a few days to deliver your items , it is likely they are contacting a manufacturer like Portland Bolt to have them made . At that point , you should ask them if the item needs to be manufactured and if they are capable of making it . If you typically use a fastener distributor to provide your fasteners and they tell you its going to take a week or more to deliver them , that should be your trigger to call Portland Bolt . <h> What are the disadvantages and potential pitfalls of buying custom manufactured bolts from a distributor ? <h> Lack of expertise <p> Because fastener distributors sell such broad range of fasteners and construction supplies , they are rarely versed in the technical aspects of nonstandard construction fasteners . They must be familiar with hundreds , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to become experts on a very small niche within the fastener industry nonstandard construction fasteners . <h> No direct line of communication <p> When nonstandard construction fasteners are purchased through a distributor , there is not a direct line of communication between the customer and the manufacturer . This can lead to bolts being ordered incorrectly due to the fact that the distributor in the middle greatly increases the chance of miscommunication between the customer and distributor and between the distributor and manufacturer . Every time the information is transferred it increases the opportunity for something to be communicated inaccurately or misinterpreted . Standard fasteners are pretty straight forward , while ordering custom fasteners can be significantly more complex . It takes a highly trained salesman to ask the correct questions to ensure custom bolt are manufactured correctly and on time . <h> Higher prices <p> If you buy custom bolts through a distributor who does n't  actually make them , you end up overpaying for those fasteners . Distributors do n't  broker custom fasteners for free , and in some cases the mark-up for passing these custom bolts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for <p> The only way distributors can compete with each other and compete against manufacturers when brokering nonstandard fasteners is to buy them from the cheapest manufacturer in the country . Distributors will shop a custom bolt until they find a manufacturer with the absolute rock bottom price , apply a minimum mark-up , and sell them to end users . What this often means is that when you buy nonstandard fasteners from a distributor , you are actually buying them from the cheapest manufacturer they could find . When this happens , the old adage often applies you get what you pay for . In order for manufacturers to sell at extremely low prices , they must cut corners in some critical areas . Low-priced manufacturers often employ unskilled laborers , do n't  invest money to maintain equipment which results in poor quality product , and do not implement scheduling systems that allow them to consistently ship product on schedule . <p> Ask yourself this question .. If you were diagnosed with a brain tumor and required surgery , would you choose the surgeon with the lowest bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bolt manufacturing is obviously not as critical as brain surgery , but you might have difficulty convincing some project managers of that ! However , we can all agree that delivering fasteners that are correct , function properly , and arrive on schedule are absolutely critical for any successful construction project . <h> What are the advantages of buying directly from a manufacturer like Portland Bolt ? <h> Expertise regarding nonstandard construction fasteners <p> Portland Bolt serves a very small niche in the fastener world . We make nonstandard construction fasteners . Therefore , we need to be experts in this area . If you need Simpson hardware , epoxy , sheet metal screws , or tools , a distributor will be much more helpful than we will . However , when you need nonstandard construction fasteners , you should consider Portland Bolt due to the fact that that 's what we do .. make custom bolts .

If you currently have a single source for all your fastener needs , we would encourage you to consider procuring nonstandard fasteners directly from a construction fastener manufacturer like Portland Bolt . It will increase the likelihood that you are receiving the best value and provide a direct line of communication with the company that is actually making your bolts . <p> Excellent data .

If a bolt is longer than what was originally needed , the bolt can be cut down in the field . How the bolt is cut is important to consider . One common , acceptable method to cut down a fastener in the field is to use a type of saw . Another method used to cut steel in the field is a flame torch . Before doing this , it is important to make sure that the material being cut is not a heat treated material .

The project began in December 2012 and ended in July 2013 . It had an estimated value of $5.2 million with over 35,000 man-hours performed before completion . The mine is stretched out over 61,389 acres and the Merrill-Crowe Plant is approximately 81,000 square feet . The Merrill-Crowe Plant is a processing plant which leaches gold and silver . The process is called Merrill-Crowe and they leach the metals by creating stock piles of ore and spray arsenic over the area to capture the residue . The ore and residue is then sent to this new building that has various filtration systems that ends in a blend of precious metals .

In these applications where rotation of the clevis pin is anticipated , I agree that a washer would protect the retaining device from possible side effects of the rotation . <p> In the case of pins that are used in structural support and bracing applications , I think that it is safe to assume that pin rotation does not occur because the loading is largely static , or at least non-reversing ( there is no push-pull going on ) .

@@23291344 @3291344/ <h> Grade C Eliminated From ASTM A307 <h> What happened to ASTM A307 Grade C ? <p> One change with regard to specifications that will have a significant impact on the construction fastener industry is the August 2007 elimination of the grade C designation within the ASTM A307 specification . ASTM A307 is the standard specification for low carbon steel construction fasteners . Until recently , A307 had three grades A , B , and C. Grade A covers bolts for general applications , grade B covers heavy hex bolts and studs for cast iron flanges , while grade C covered unheaded anchor bolts , either bent or straight , intended for structural anchorage purposes . Last year 's elimination of A307 grade C is the result of a virtually identical specification , F1554 grade 36 developed in 1994 , replacing it . <p> Although A307 grade C and F1554 grade 36 are virtually identical , there are some subtle yet very important differences .

Additionally , imported A307 hex bolts that are commonly embedded in concrete and used as anchor bolts will not meet F1554 grade 36 . However , many fastener distributors and even some manufacturers who do not have a thorough understanding of the differences between ASTM A307 grade C and F1554 grade 36 continue to provide A307 bolts believing they will cross-certify to ASTM F1554 grade 36 which is simply not the case in most instances . It is important to be aware of the differences between these two specifications to limit exposure to unnecessary liability . <p> @Alceu The main difference is that A36 is a raw material standard , whereas A307 Gr.C ( which has since been replaced by F1554 gr.36 ) is a fastener standard .

An example of a body bound or tight-fitting bolt is one in which precision is required in order to hold together parts of machinery or similar applications to prevent the slightest change of position of one part on another . This type of bolt must be supplied with Unified National Course ( UNC ) class 3A/3B thread fit which requires very tight tolerances where both thread fit and the bolt grip dimensions are critical .

First , all of the bolts and fasteners needed to be hot-dip galvanized , which we do in-house at our facility in Portland , Oregon . Second , all of the fasteners needed were to be 100% melted and manufactured in the United States of America . This meant that all of the hex bolts and all of the hex lag screws would need to be hot forged in our facility from scratch . This requirement was a large reason why the contractor constructing the bridge came to us , since domestically manufactured lag screws are not available in the marketplace , and the fact that we have no problem manufacturing this part sets us apart from most other bolt suppliers . 
@@23291359 @3291359/ <h> Washers for Timber Bolts <h> Are timber bolts installed with a washer under the head of the bolt ? <p> Timber bolts , also referred to as economy bolts in the Pacific Northwest , are designed with a round oversized head which eliminates the need for a washer underneath the head . The underside of the head has two nubs which bite into wood and prevent the head from spinning in the timber . The nubs under the head require a wood bearing surface to bite into , making a steel washer impossible to place in that location . <p> Timber bolts are commonly used in marine application where the low-profile head creates a safer surface than that of a hex head if a boat or vessel where to collide with the head of the bolt .

Simply , the A615 grade is a rebar specification for concrete reinforcement ; it is not an anchor bolt or raw steel specification . Using rebar for anchor bolts does present some complex issues , such as threading , that would need to be addressed .

@@23291361 @3291361/ <h> UL Listings and ICC-ES Reports <h> Do your products have a UL Listing or ICC-ES report available ? <p> No . The products manufactured by Portland Bolt do not fall under the umbrella of products that would require a UL listing or ICC-ES report . There are three main governing bodies that cover specifications for fasteners . ASTM ( American Society for Testing and Materials ) covers primarily bolts and fasteners for construction applications . SAE ( Society of Automotive Engineers ) covers fasteners for automotive , machinery , and OEM applications . ASME ( American Society of Mechanical Engineers ) standards B18.2.1 and B18.2.1 cover dimensional tolerances for square and hex head bolts , screws , and nuts . Portland Bolt manufactures fasteners to these three sets of specifications ( ASTM , SAE , and ASME ) . A fourth specification group that is also applicable is AASHTO ( American Association of State Highway &amp; Transportation Officials ) . AASHTO specifications are typically only called out on highway projects and many AASHTO designations can be directly converted to an ASTM equivalent . <p> ICC ( International Code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintaining building , plumbing , mechanical , and fire codes adopted by local and state municipalities , and the federal government . ICC-ES ( International Code Council-Evaluation Services , Inc. ) is the branch of ICC responsible for performing technical evaluations of building products , components , methods , and materials to ensure that they meet the requirements of the codes . This evaluation process culminates in an ICC-ES report that provides evidence that the evaluated product or system meets code requirements . However , in the case of most anchor bolts and fasteners , the applicable sections of the codes ( International Building Code , International Residential Code , International Property Maintenance Code , Etc. ) direct you to the ASTM specifications covering said anchor bolts or fasteners . As the ASTM specifications already cover anchor bolts and fasteners in detail , there is no reason for ICC to write their own specifications for these items . For the same reason , ICC-ES does not need to perform evaluation testing of anchor bolts or fasteners . As long as the bolts meet the applicable ASTM specification(s) , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a service provided by Underwriters Laboratories Inc ( UL ) . Manufacturers submit products to UL for testing and safety certification on a voluntary basis . There are no laws specifying that a product must be tested and given a UL Mark . While there are many municipalities that have laws , codes or regulations which require a product to be tested by a nationally recognized testing laboratory ( such as UL ) before that product can be used within their jurisdiction , anchor bolts and fasteners are typically not among these products . This is for two reasons ; the first being that products required to be tested and receive a UL Listing are typically potentially hazardous products , including marine products , life saving devices , fire suppression and containment products , chemicals , and industrial , mechanical and automotive equipment . The second reason is that , just as with ICC-ES , the ASTM specifications already cover bolts and fasteners in depth , and it would be redundant to re-cover the same information . <p> In summation , as long as a bolt or fastener is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or AASHTO specification , there is no need for it to be tested or evaluated by ICC-ES , UL , or other similar listing services .

@@23291382 @3291382/ <h> Torque for Stainless Steel <h> Why does Portland Bolt 's torque chart not have values for stainless steel fasteners ? <p> Portland Bolt 's Torque Chart includes approximate torque values for fastener specifications made from carbon steel and alloy steel . We have chosen to exclude torque values related to fastener specification made from stainless steel .

Galling , or cold welding , can occur when fasteners are subjected to a high amount of pressure causing the nut and bolt to fuse together .

@@23291385 @3291385/ <h> Large A490 Structural Bolts <p> According to ASTM A490-11 , the answer is no . The A490 specification only covers diameters from 1/2 ? to 1-1/2 ? , inclusive . An A490 bolt can not be made above 1-1/2 ? diameter ; ASTM does not allow it . Since there are no chemical requirements , hardness requirements , or strength requirements for A490 fasteners above 1-1/2 ? diameter , no manufacturer would be able to certify a bolt above 1-1/2 ? to ASTM A490 .

This grade of fastener can be manufactured in diameters from 1/4 ? to 4 ? , inclusive , and is virtually identical to A490 in strength and chemistry through 1-1/2 ? diameter . However , there is no way to compare the two grades above 1-1/2 ? diameter , due to the fact that A490 does not have any strength requirements in diameters larger than 1-1/2 ? .

The SC connection means that it is a type of bolted structural steel connection which relies on friction between the two connected elements rather than bolt shear or bolt bearing to join two structural elements . Or to put it another way , both surfaces must be absolutely free of any impediments between the two surfaces .

@@23291471 @3291471/ <h> Product Catalog <h> Can Portland Bolt mail me a catalog and a price list ? <p> Portland Bolt does not have a traditional catalog or price list . The reason for this is because the majority of fasteners supplied by Portland Bolt are custom made on a per order basis. - Once manufactured , the parts are shipped out immediately to the end user , so a price list would not be easy to compile . Portland Bolt does keep some common sized fasteners in stock , such as 90 degree bent anchor bolts , timber bolts , structural bolts , hex bolts , carriage bolts and lag screws , however the pricing can vary depending on the quantity ordered . This makes it difficult to hold to a set price list .

@@23291474 @3291474/ <h> Turned Eye Bolts <h> Do Portland Bolt eye bolts have load ratings ? <p> Portland Bolt manufactures eye bolts to pretty much any size imaginable . The type of eye bolt that Portland Bolt makes is not forged , but is turned and can be welded shut if needed. - When load ratings are provided for eye bolts , they are normally for forged eye bolts , where the eye is formed as one solid piece. - Forged eye bolts are designed for holding a certain weight or are required to lift a certain amount. - Although a turned eye bolt can be used for these same purposes , it is not advisable without the consultation of an engineer. - It is for this reason that a turned eye bolt does not normally undergo testing for load capacity. - Technically , any style of eye bolt can undergo a load rating test upon request ; however it is not common for a turned eye bolt. - If you have an application where an eye bolt needs to be able to hold a certain weight and a load rating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer before using a turned eye bolt. - In summary , Portland Bolt provides chemical and physical mill test reports on the steel used to manufacture turned eye bolts but will not be able to provide load ratings .

@@23291486 @3291486/ <h> ASTM A709 Grade 36 Bolts <h> Can I order bolts to ASTM A709 Grade 36 ? <p> The simple answer here is no. - ASTM A709 is a specification that covers carbon and high-strength structural steel plates and bars intended for use in bridge applications . There are multiple grades of A709 and Grade 36 covers the structural steel made from mild carbon steel , such as A36 . Although Portland Bolt would manufacture an A709 Grade 36 bolt out of the same material we would use for A307 Grade A bolts or F1554 Grade 36 anchor bolts ( which are standard mild steel fastener specifications ) , ASTM A709 is not a fastener specification . This specification only covers structural steel used in bridge applications . It does not provide the manufacturer with the bolt guidelines which are necessary for the manufacturing process , such as bolt configuration , thread type/amount , compatible nuts/washers and so on. - Without having these necessary details , the bolt would not be manufactured without a long discussion regarding every little detail between the manufacturer and the purchaser . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel specifications , see the FAQ Ordering Bolts to ASTM A36. - It saves time and money for both parties if a proper bolt specification is called out .
