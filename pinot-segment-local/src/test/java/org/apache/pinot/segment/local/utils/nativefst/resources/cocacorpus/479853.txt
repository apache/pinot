Leo is an awesome instructor ! ! ! <p> Linda A. <p> Just a quick message from a customer in England , just to say a huge " Thank You " for your wonderful designs . I purchased my Portrait in August last year , and I found Dreaming Tree designs after mooching around the internet for a couple of months.Your designs cut beautifully on my Portrait and so far have needed very little resizing . When given away to family and friends they always get wonderful praise and admiration . My particular favourite is the Stardust Luminary ; unfortunately some of the electrical components couldnt be sourced in the UK so I just made the shade at full size and slipped in a colour changing led mason jar . It looks amazing ! The leds do n't  get hot ( I tested mine by leaving it running for a few hours ) so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have made three more as Christmas gifts , which I know will go down a storm . Many thanks for your beautiful designs you put so much work into the cutting files and the tutorials I know my project will turn out looking like yours . Please keep these wonderful designs coming ! ! <p> Alison E. <p> I just had to tell you I made the Daisy Cascade Card today for a 1st wedding anniversary .

I ease of putting it together was wonderful except for the roof . I could not get that to save my soul so I cut to flat rectangle pieces instead of one . I put one on the inside to glue to and then the other in the outside . This made it work so much easier and better for me . My only other issue was the sizing of the vellum . My print out did not fit the front window ( will scan to my silhouette and increase it a bit next time ) and I had to cut the windows apart to make them fit my cut out . The instructions were top notch . Finish my first RV for a friend and will now make one for my self patterned after our RV . Thanks for a great file ! ! ! 113177 @qwx973177

Easy to construct . The only problem is finding a place to show it off .. and to allow it to unfold fully . It is quite large when unfolded . I liked the cute snowmen , but decided to replace them with Christmas trees , which I cut using the library file on my machine , and then adapting the hinge portion of the snowmen , so that the trees would stand up like the snowmen do . This was a fun project to make . 113177 @qwx973177
