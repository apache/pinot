Unwinding your mind from a busy day can be hard , so we asked our- panel of bloggers to weigh in . Give their sleeping hacks a try- when you get ready for bed tonight ! <h> Q : <h> What does your ideal routine for sleep look like ? <p> Sleep has always been a challenge for me , but it is incredibly important to my wellness routine both physically and emotionally . For me I make it a priority to get in bed or at least start getting ready for bed at 10pm in order to get 8 hours of solid sleep . Then my room is nice and dark with no lights coming from the outside and no electronics on in my room . Also , it is really important for me to pay attention to what I am eating through the day in order to balance my blood sugar ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night ) and that I have not had any sugar or caffeine late in the day as both will keep me up at night . <h> Kasin Anton <p> Probably just relaxing and reading a book before bed while doing a face mask . It practically never happens but I always have the best sleep when I have n't been on my phone or watching tv before bed , and face masks are so relaxing ! <h> Hailey Bettencourt <p> I find I feel the most rested if I go to bed before midnight . If go to bed at 2 am , I wo n't feel as rested even if I get the same hours of sleep . I also do n't have caffeine past 2 pm or I wo n't sleep as well . Ultimately it 's different for every individual .

But the key thing is I need at least 8 hours of restful sleep . <h> Mindy Fong <p> Ideally I like to make sure I have thought about what went on during the day and what needs to be done for the next day long before I sleep . Once that is done the majority of my stressors are free from my mind . Once my mind is clear I make sure to sleep when I 'm slightly tired . If I am not tired enough I will toss and turn which in turn keeps me awake . Lastly , I enjoy listening to calming sounds like white noise or light river water . <h> Natalie Gantz <p> I 'm a creature of habit when it comes to wellness so my routine 's the same every night . I take a relaxing shower , moisturize my skin , and turn off ALL of my electronic devices .

In light- of International Women 's Day , we asked seven amazing- women for their self-care tips and definition of a- " strong woman .

But now I start off each day by foam rolling on a TriggerPoint Therapy GRID for about 10 minutes , concentrating ( currently ! ) on my calves and mid-back .

I 've found that when I get enough sleep ( 8ish hours ) , everything else seems to fall into place much easier : patience , focus , motivation , creativity , positivity . When I cut short my rest , I am actually sacrificing much more than actual pillow time . <h> What does a " strong woman " mean to you ? <p> Sarah : A woman who speaks up for herself , taking time to do something for herself at least once a day , whether it 's working out , meditating , reading , crafting , or savoring a mug of tea in silence . She does n't back down when confronted about her beliefs , and she goes to the mat for her friends and family .

I dedicate one hour of every day to working out , which is my " me-time " where I can focus solely on myself and thank my body for all it does by exercising . I set aside time in the evening to meditate where I clear my mind and set intentions for the new day . Our skin is our biggest organ , so I make sure to pamper it by using gentle products , exfoliants and moisturizing masks on a consistent basis . <h> What a " strong woman " means to her : <p> A strong woman knows her own identity and is unapologetically herself .

Whenever I 'm having a bad day , or succumbing to all of those second-guessing feelings in my head , I remind myself of what I preach , and the message I promote . I wanted to put a message out there that says it 's okay to fail . It 's okay to fall off the wagon . It 's okay to eat perfect all day and then have an unplanned treat . If you continue to love yourself anyway through your little bumps , eventually you will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotes the life you deserve and want . <h> What a " strong woman " means to her : <p> I think a strong woman is n't necessarily someone ' hard ' or physically strong . It 's someone who is secure enough in herself that she does n't need to bring others down . Someone who can forgive , because it does n't make her weak by allowing others redemption within her life . Someone who can compliment others because lifting others up does n't bring her down . A strong woman recognizes that we can all be strong , beautiful , amazing and capable by standing together , and not trying to tear each other down . <h> Alizah Akiko runs Little Spark of Wanderlust , a travel diary dedicated to making life an adventure . Rather than taking a job in the corporate world , Alizah took a leap of faith and now travels the globe for a living . <h> On practicing self-care : <p> I practice self-care by taking care of my mental health . This means taking the time to exercise , meditate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relax . I also practice self-love . It can be so easy to get into the habit of being hard on yourself and say things about yourself that you would n't say to anyone else , but I try to stick to the rule of being positive and encouraging to myself . <h> What a " strong woman " means to her : <p> A strong woman means fighting for and making sure that you have freedom in all aspects of life . I 'm a true believer that women can do anything that they set their minds to and I think it 's important for women to fight for that in their life . <h> On practicing self-care : <p> I love fitness and for me moving my body on a daily basis is a huge part of self care . When I move my body I feel better about myself and have more energy which carries over into my work and daily interactions .

@@101621340 @5821340/ <h> 4 Steps To Feel More " In Sync " This Autumn <p> If you 're in San Francisco , you probably know for a fact that we do n't feel the effects of the different seasons much , but I know you all felt the following phenomenon - the days are shorter , night comes faster , and waking up in the mornings seems to be a little harder than usual. - <p> Our bodies are set to cyclical natures , much like the cyclical natures of day and night , the waxing and waning moon , the incoming and receding tide , summer and winter . In fact , almost all metabolic processes within our bodies are cyclical , working in feedback loops that are triggered or stopped by internal and external ( environmental ) cues . <p> Trees and flowers follow the cyclical patterns of Nature , animals follow the cyclical patterns of Nature , and even in agricultural cultures , the cyclical patterns are observed . However , those of us living in more urban environments seem to want to defy the forces of Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest and reflection of the year , most people push themselves harder and harder to finish projects before the year 's end . In addition , festivities that require output of energy that are placed closely one after the other - Halloween , Thanksgiving , Christmas , and New Year - put further stress on the body and the mind when it is a time for withdrawing and conserving our energies . <p> The Yogic sciences place great emphases on following these internal and external cycles . The ancient scriptures detail specific times to rise , to meditate , to eat , to sleep , and even to engage in sexual activities . Diseases arise when we become out of sync with these patterns - when we continue to work and exercise hard when the body wants to rest , when we consume a cold juice on a chilly , windy day , when we sleep at 2am and rise at 10am , and when we eat a large , heavy meal at 9pm . <p> If you 've been feeling " out of sync " of some sorts recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come back " in sync . " Even when seasons are not as clearly defined here in the Bay Area , our bodies ingrained wisdom still follow a pattern , and these practices will help guide you back to the beat . <p> 1 . Go to bed between 10pm-11pm . <p> I can already hear some of you saying , " But that 's impossible ! I have to do X , Y , and Z before bed . There is no way I can get to bed before 11pm ! " Well , I urge you to look a little more closely at your evening routine . How much of it is spent aimlessly browsing through social media or replying to emails that are not important ? How much of it is spent watching 2 , 3 , or even 4 episodes of your favorite TV shows ? I enjoy TV shows and social media browsing just as much as the next person since it gives my brain a time to be " switched off " or change focus , but I have a hard-stop for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedtime ( so if you are aiming to sleep by 11pm , switch off your TV and phones by 10pm ) . Yes , that might mean I am sometimes left in suspense after one episode of a TV show , but I never regret it after I switch off my TV and opt for some quality down-time . Usually that means a book , some journaling , a long shower , a mini facial , and/or light stretching/restorative yoga . Give yourself at least 30 minutes to an hour to get back in touch with your body and your body 's internal clock to help you get into a deeper , restful sleep . <p> 2 . Opt for soups , stews , and lighter fares for dinner . <p> One of the biggest mistakes people make is having their largest meals at night . Having a large meal at night is not inherently " bad , " but the bigger mistake is having a large meal way too late . Ideally , you 'd want to finish eating at least 2-3 hours before bedtime to give your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body should NOT be predominantly focused on still digesting your last meal . Rather , your body should be focused on digesting and eliminating your emotional and mental imprints from the day . If you 've seen the movie Inside Out , you would have seen that during sleep , our brain is actively processing the experiences and memories of the day - keeping ones that are important and eliminating those that are not . In addition to this " brain cleansing " activity , the rest of your organs are being repaired and maintained in preparation for the next day . Therefore , if for the first 2-3 hours of your sleep your body is still trying to digest physical bits of food , you are inherently taking away precious organ repair time . Soups and light stews are great in that a ) they are easier to digest , and b ) they are grounding in nature , which can help put the body into a more relaxed mode . <p> 3 . Balance your intense workouts with grounding practices . <p> I know many people feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up " for the large quantities of food and calories consumed around this time of year . However , as I 've mentioned above , the body and mind are not primed for intense output of energy in late autumn and early winter . Excessive exercise and activities can ultimately burn you out at this time of the year when your body and mind crave more rest . So if you want to keep up with your workout regime , I highly encourage you to balance that with restorative yoga practices and meditation . <p> 4 . Reflect and express gratitude . <p> Last and final step that I think everybody should practice all the time regardless of time of the year is to reflect on your accomplishments and express gratitude . The human brain is wired to focus more on faults and negativities , which can bring on a whole ' nother baggage of problems with overall well-being when left unchecked . Whether you want to spend 5 minutes before bed to mentally list your top achievements and grateful moments of the day or physically write them down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't been giving yourself the credit you deserve ! If you 're looking for a more structured approach to starting and ending your day with gratitude , I highly recommend the Five Minute Journal . <p> As with all goal attainments , the most important thing is to take small steps at a time . Try just ONE THING from the list above for at least 3 weeks and observe how that feels in your body and mind . Do you feel more rested ? Do you feel more connected with your energy ? If not , try another suggestion from the list and repeat . Once you find one thing that works and that you feel really good about , you 'd naturally want to continue with this new habit and perhaps even try another one . <p> Elaine had always known that she was born to heal people and change their lives , and she found that through her work as a yoga therapy teacher and nutrition consultant .

This usually happens within the first few hours of sleeping , and your body does n't usually spend much time in deep sleep . Deep sleep can include both non-REM deep sleep ( the last phase of sleep ) as well as REM sleep . To feel refreshed and well-rested , it s important to receive between an hour and three hours of deep sleep each night . Pay close attention to your deep sleep time when you review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of time spent here ! <p> Amazfit tracks light and deep sleep by the subtle movements that occur through the night . So while true sleep stages are detected by brain wave activity , we do our best to approximate light and deep sleep with the movement in your arms ( or neck , if you are using Amazfit as a necklace ) . <p> In the course of each sleep cycle , the entire process of going from non-REM sleep to REM sleep stages takes 90 minutes on average . Being interrupted at any point in the middle of a sleep cycle can cause you to wake up feeling tired . This is another reason why you may sometimes wake up after sleeping 8 hours feeling groggy ! <h> HOW CAN I GET QUALITY SLEEP ? <p> As you begin to understand more about sleep , you may wonder how to get high quality sleep each night . For high quality sleep , we recommend you to target between 1 and 3 hours of deep sleep each night . Deep sleep is the key to quality sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a few more recommendations on how to reach and maintain deep sleep each night . Lastly , for high quality sleep , do n't hit that snooze button ! Hitting snooze often gets you a few more minutes of sleep at the cost of waking up between sleep cycles , making you feel more tired overall . <p> The amount of time each person needs to sleep to feel well-rested can vary widely . As a starting point , we recommend you to try targeting 7.5 hours of sleep each night - this is the equivalent of five sleep cycles . Some people need less sleep than others - so listen to what your body tells you and adjust your sleep patterns accordingly . <p> Have you tried adjusting your sleep time and alarms in the morning ?

I know that whatever issues I 'm facing , someone out there has it many times worse . Thinking about and taking the positive out of every negative situation helps as well .

What does " good food " look like for you ? <h> Q : <h> What does " Eat Your Best " mean to you ? <h> A : <p> The most import aspect of nutrition for me is two fold ; Make sure to eat as much unprocessed food as possible and everything in moderation . At first glance , processed food seems fine , but the long term effects of the chemicals and preservatives are endless . As a fitness professional , I tell my clients to get active now for long term benefits . Eating is no different . Eat as clean as you can now , or you will regret it later . The second part of eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eat the foods you love , just make sure to have some self control and know your portion sizes . <h> Joe Rosenthal <p> Eating my best means avoiding foods that make me feel bad . It also means trying to make each meal as nutrient dense as possible . My husband and I often cook at home , which makes that easy to control . It 's harder when eating out , but I 've found a happy medium of enjoying company and celebrating , but respecting my eating and drinking decisions . <h> Natalie Gantz <p> I feel better when I eat a lot of fresh produce . Living plants full of vitamins , and water . Fruits and veggies . The more the better . However ... There is nothing that I absolutely do n't allow myself to eat . I just eat really healthy as often as possible . I love salads , fruits . <h> Mindy Fong <p> Ooh , that 's a tough one . I still do n't think I 've found the perfect balance between healthy eating and ' treats ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think that eating my best means fueling my body . Sometimes , I want an Oreo , and if I do n't eat the entire sleeve , I do n't think that 's a problem . You can eat pizza and it be healthy as well , I think a lot of people confuse eating your best with eating broccoli and baked white fish , and that 's not the case . I think the ideal would be eating wholesome foods that are full of flavor and have a bit of everything . One of my favorite people to follow is Zanna Van Dijk ( she 's also so down to earth and lovely in person as well , and she 's stunning ! ) She always says moderation not deprivation , which is so true . I think it 's the same as finding work-life balance . You need to recognize when you need a little treat , allow it , and get over it ! <h> Kasin Anton <p> Eating a balanced diet . I do n't believe in cutting food groups ! In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , white bread is n't the best option , but there 's nothing wrong with a potato . It 's not the potato that 's the problem - it 's the butter and sour cream you put in it ! I 'm all about eating foods from each and every food group for breakfast , lunch , AND dinner . That means eating healthy fats ( avocados , natural peanut butter , nuts ) , eating carbs , and getting enough calories each day to keep my energy up . I 'm not a fan of starving myself ! I will NEVER do that to my body . Remember , strong is sexy ! <h> Kimberly Kong <p> I know what makes me feel good . I know what does n't . Ideally , a COMPLETELY unprocessed day would be perfect . Fresh fruit and veggies , no fried foods , and of course , a nice cup of organic coffee . I always feel my best on vacation in warm places , and I attribute that to to the access to fresh food .

I was so sick and tired of not fitting into my clothes , and not fitting into small/medium items like I was used to . I wanted to make a change instead of accepting the weight gain and buying new clothes so I did ! <p> In the early days of the transformation , how did you motivate yourself to keep going ? <p> I definitely did n't motivate myself by seeing progress .

A typical workout for weight training is a compilation of 5-7 exercises ranging from 2-4 sets of generally 10-20 reps . This is what I 'm currently doing , prepping for my upcoming fitness competition . There will be weeks when I incorporate more strength training and do sets with less reps to build more muscle , but not right now so close to my competition . <p> Was all the hard work worth it ? <p> So far ?

@@101621419 @5821419/ <h> Eating Whole Foods <p> Nutrition can become confusing as one day we are told to follow the USDA Food Plate ( formally known as the Food Pyramid ) , on another we are told to eat Paleo or vegetarian , and on yet another we are told to eat everything but in moderation . So which is it ? <p> This is the golden question ! Nutrition must be personalized as each person s needs are different based on age , exercise levels , disease state , stress , environment , genes , health goals , and so much more . <p> However , at the most basic level , everyone benefits the most from focusing on whole , nutrient-dense , organic , and diverse foods . Too often we forget how powerful food choices are , as foods can not only either harm or heal us physically and mentally but also play key roles in our overall health and disease progression . <h> AVOIDING PROCESSED FOODS <p> While eating whole foods seems obvious , many Americans heavily rely on processed foods . Processed foods come in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or salt , while others are loaded with artificial ingredients . <p> When you go grocery shopping , have you seen processed foods that carry labels like made from whole grains , fortified , low fat , low carb , or are kid-approved ? These foods are marketed successfully , but many of them actually rob the body of nutrients at a faster rate , cause blood sugar imbalances , increase hunger , and often result in weight gain ! <p> In contrast , when you eat whole , unprocessed foods , your body knows how to incorporate and utilize nutrients optimally and will provide you with the correct feedback as to when to stop eating . Eating these whole foods - whether it be apples , bananas , avocados , or a few sticks of carrots - lead to increased vitality , both physically and mentally . <h> HEALTHY EATING CHOICES <p> Commonly I hear , I know which foods are healthy , but the packaged foods just taste so good ! Committing to changing habits and staying accountable are the most important but almost most difficult aspects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Cutting out processed foods and focusing on whole nutritious meals can lead you to experience numerous personal benefits both in the long term and in the short term . Eating healthily now can potentially lower healthcare costs down the line and lead to a stronger , healthier you . In the short term , making healthy eating choices can up your energy levels , improve your sleep and emotional health , and encourage weight loss . <p> It may seem to be more expensive to purchase whole foods , and many people complain about how quickly the food goes bad . But on the most basic level , why would anyone want to eat something that is scientifically designed to not rot ? Everything that grows should at some point decompose . While this can feel annoying when you reach in the crisper drawer and realize that you 'd forgotten about the lettuce you bought last week , this is actually a good reminder .
