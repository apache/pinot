@@11767780 @367780/ <h> Injuries mean the USMNT 's head coach will be without a number of big name players for Friday 's crunch match in San Jose . <p> GOAL.com <p> By Ives Galarcep <p> U.S. national team coach Bruce Arena has some tough decisions to make with regards to his starting lineup for Friday 's crucial World Cup qualifier against Honduras , but a week of training should help make things more clear . <p> Jordan Morris did n't take part in training on Wednesday , the team 's final full practice session , making the likelihood of him starting remote . Without the young speedster , Arena may be forced to rush Clint Dempsey back into a starting role , something the coach sounded against doing just last week . <p> It may sound like a no-brainer to plug Dempsey into the lineup considering he has started three matches for the Seattle Sounders to open the MLS season . But a starting role for the U.S. in a World Cup qualifier will bring a more physically demanding task than Dempsey has had to face in MLS , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national team . <p> The U.S. does n't appear to have that luxury anymore , and it just might force Arena into a decision that works out better for the Americans , especially against a Honduras side expected to set up in full bunker mode . Arena is likely left with the choice of either starting Dempsey or being forced into playing Jozy Altidore as his lone striker . It was n't difficult to tell which option Altidore preferred based on his glowing remarks about Dempsey 's national team return . <p> " Clint , I 'm so happy he 's back personally . It 's really fun playing with him , " Altidore said . " He scores a lot of goals , he opens up a lot of space for people . He 's just a good player to play with . " <p> Deciding on whether or not to start Dempsey is just one of a handful of decisions Arena must make . Another is where to play Geoff Cameron . Capable of handling three different roles , Cameron looks like a strong bet to play right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in the past year and that he has stated repeatedly that he feels it 's his third-best position . <p> On Wednesday , the Stoke City man made it clear he was capable of , and committed to , handling any role Arena gives him . <p> " I 've played 60 something ( games ) in the Premier League ( at right back ) , " Cameron said on Wednesday . " I 've played 40 something games at center mid and center ( back ) , and I 'm playing against the best players in the world in the best league in the world . My play speaks for itself . I can go into a number of positions . For me , it 's a plus because I 'm on the field . I do n't think there 's many players that can play those three positions consistently every single weekend . <p> " But if the team needs me , if Bruce needs me to play at right back because he believes in me that I can perform and shut down one of their good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping the team , " Cameron added . " But he knows that , and I 've told him , that my best position is either center ( back ) or defensive midfield . That 's where I rate myself , but I also rate myself as a right back and I can do the job and I 've done it before for Jurgen Klinsmann , and I 'm sure I 'll do it for Bruce when he needs me . " <p> Cameron 's response may have given away the role he is likely to play . Right back is a key role for the U.S. against Honduras because of the talented speedsters the Catrachos can deploy on the left wing . Honduras ' top player , Andy Najar , could be stationed on the left wing , making a Cameron shift to right back a very sensible decision . <p> If Arena goes that route , then a center-back pairing of John Brooks and Omar Gonzalez appears to be the leading option in the middle of the defense . Brooks has taken part in full training and appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Gonzalez 's experience should give him the nod as Brooks ' partner . <p> Left back should also be handled by another veteran , with DaMarcus Beasley looking like the safer bet ahead of Jorge Villafana . <p> As important as Arena 's back-line selections are , figuring out the best attacking options remains a top priority given Honduras ' likely formation of a five-man defense with two defensive midfielders in support . Christian Pulisic is the most sure bet among midfield starters in the front four , most likely as a winger , while deciding on a creative midfielder to play centrally is a bit more difficult . Sebastian Lletget only made his national team debut in January , but Arena likes his game , and he has the attacking attributes to help unlock the Honduras defense . <p> Arena could choose to play Lletget on the wing , but a central-midfield role seems more likely for the LA Galaxy standout . <p> " I 'm more comfortable in center midfield , but I 've played many , many times out wide and I know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Lletget , who could also be deployed a bit deeper in central midfielder , behind another playmaker , to give the U.S. more creative options to try and break down the Honduras defensive wall . <p> Sacha Kljestan is another option in central midfield , especially if Arena decides not to start Dempsey . Even if Dempsey plays , Kljestan could be installed in an attacking midfield role in a 4-4-2 formation , where his ability to deliver the killer pass could prove invaluable against Honduras ' stingy defense . Though he was n't part of the original squad chosen for the upcoming qualifiers , Kljestan is still confident he can step in and start if called upon . <p> " That was my attitude basically . For me , it does n't matter if I was the first guy called in or the last , " Kljestan told Goal . " The first time Jurgen Klinsmann brought me back in I think it was like last August , I was n't on the original roster but then I played 30 minutes off the bench in the first game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference , so whatever role I 'm handed I 'm fine with . <p> " If I play 180 minutes I 'll be happy , if I play zero I 'll still be happy as long as we get some points , " Kljestan added .

In their current state McLaren have nothing to lose , so why not use the opportunity to blood a young driver ?

If it were Stoffel Vandoorne leaving the team for one race , sure , throw in a development driver . But a team needs guarantees on every race weekend . Alonso gives them exactly that currently , and Button will give them exactly that at Monaco . The cars are faster in 2017 , but they are not that much different to last year 's .

Substitute Thomas Muller brought the ball down in the box , with Ramos , Nacho and Navas left looking at each other after the captain bundled into his own net . <p> With the tie once more on a knife-edge , Madrid were again handed an advantage as Vidal earned his second booking of the night for a challenge on Asensio , despite having clearly got a foot on the ball . <p> Lewandowski was sacrificed for Joshua Kimmich as an open extra-time period began , with Casemiro seeing shouts for a penalty waved away before Asensio was denied at the near post by a smart Neuer stop . <p> Ronaldo gave Neuer no chance in the 104th minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before half-volleying into the net left-footed ; although replays showed that he had strayed offside . <p> And Ronaldo 's Champions League ton was up soon after thanks to the selfless Marcelo , who danced through the back line and unselfishly squared to leave Neuer exposed . <p> Bayern 's resistance was broken at last and Asensio added gloss to the scoreline with the goal of the game , driving beyond Hummels before slotting right-footed into the bottom-left corner of the net to send the holders marching into the last four .
