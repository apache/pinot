On my way home I caught the 10:20 pm Long Branch at 11:00 pm . We did not leave until 11:10 pm from Track 14 you could smell the burned metal on the mezzanine . As we left you could still see the train on Track 9 with a Amtrak Engine coupled to it , But only 3 cars . The other 3 were detacted and hooked to another Amtrak Engine I assume there only using one tube until that train can be moved .

The problem remains the same though : how do you provide service to those affected by these outages ? The MTA is rolling out all the stops in anticipation of the upcoming Canarsie shutdown in 2019 and is hoping that it 's enough to handle displaced line riders . When all is said and done , this will be a three-year planning period for an 18-month shutdown . Similar steps would have to be done for other projects of that nature if not more . With the Manhattan trunks and the Queens Blvd line as major areas where maintenance work and signal/track upgrades are desperately needed , even more effort may need to be put into this , even if these proposed shutdowns will last significantly less than on the Canarsie line . No matter how you slice it , should they move to more long-term line closures , it will be a daunting task for the MTA to reroute service around these outages and provide enough alternate service for displaced riders . <p> Man , this year is when we all fight the MTA . Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fund the MTA " , people are just getting fed up with this crap and everybody sees it . Yesterday , the MTA apologized on Twitter cause their 1930 's era signal system malfunctioned and caused extensive delays on the B division and the comments were all hate and rightfully so . Some people even hopped off the train and walked back to the next station cause they were so fed up . MTA has to realize they ca n't be providing this type of service with such unreliability . Shit piles up , and when the hatch can no longer hold all of it , it breaks and all hell comes raining down . On the same hand , with such a large scale operation , shit will happen but it 's becoming all too regular . We see it not only on our subways and buses but LIRR as well , oddly MNRR not as much .........

Commuters have to fill out a form on the MTA website with information about the delay such as the subway line and time of day it occurred . <p> The MTA first launched the online service in 2010 , but it reminded commuters about the system Monday morning after over a dozen subway lines experienced delays because of signal issues . <p> An MTA representative said verifications were emailed to customers within two business days . <p> Subway delays have more than doubled from roughly 28,000 a month in 2012 to 70,000 each month this year , according to The New York Times .

Andrew Cuomo is also providing a $1 million " Genius " grant to the person with the best solution for fixing problems directly connected to subway delays , like an aging signal system . <p> As a state agency , the MTA is controlled by Cuomo , who has taken heat for channeling more funding toward subway expansion projects than tackling delays . <p> Many New York subway commuters voiced their discontent with the growing number of delays on social media after the MTA drew attention to its verification system : <p> LocationThird Avenue , the only " Major Avenue " that continues from Manhattan into The Bronx <p> Posted 06 June 2017 - 11:00 PM <p> Lol when was the last time the subway was " delay " free ?

Bailey runs alongside the Major Deegan , so while it 's not as dense as other parts of The Bronx , you still have some apartment buildings further up where the residents are basically forced to walk to Kingsbridge Road or Fordham Road for bus service . Somebody correct me if I 'm wrong , but I believe the Bx24 used to cover that area ( I forget whether it took Bailey to Kingsbridge or to Fordham , I 'm pretty sure it was Fordham ) . For that matter , does anybody have the full routing from end to end ? ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the Henry Hudson Parkway service road , then took 253rd to Fieldston Road ) <p> Anyway , ideally it would be nice if there was a route running the length of Sedgwick ( say , starting at 170th &amp; GC , then running down **32;56;TOOLONG and go all the way up to Kingsbridge . This would also allow the Bx11 to run straight across 170th to Plimpton/Ogden ) . I mention that because I remember a few times I had to go to the area by where the Bx18 turns at Sedgwick/Undercliff and it felt very isolated . Granted , with the Deegan over there , it 's not that populated ( matter of fact , the reason I was going over there was related to construction work ) , but for the ( relatively ) few residents there , it 's very isolated . The problem is such a route would duplicate the Bx18 too much . <p> Anyway , as for the petition , those people need to be vocal . Sad to say , handing it to somebody at 347 Madison Avenue or 2 Broadway is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contact their community boards , local newspapers , and get people to physically go down and speak at the monthly board meetings if they expect to get actual results . <p> ...

The parking is horrendous , the street too narrow , and the traffic rate too high for any bus to get through there . <p> Bad enough that if a cop stops there no one is getting past ; there was a time when a fire engine had to respond to a call over there and it took 5 minutes to navigate - even with drivers backing up the hill/going through the Fordham signal and gypsy cabs not flipping a bitch chasing fares for once . <p> They 'd have to straighten out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is that a regular local route would benefit the entire area .

Fordham Oval Hill is a LARGE gated co-op community with nine buildings spread out over quite a bit of land ( at least seven acres ) . As such , it functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such per the website ) , so even if there was a local bus service say on Sedgwick , some residents would still have to walk quite a bit just to get to the bus . Given the hilly topography and the size of the cooperative , a shuttle bus service would still make sense , in addition to the regular local bus service . We have several co-ops here in Riverdale with such a set up despite having local bus service nearby because of their location and/or the needs of the residents living there being very specific . All of them use vans to shuttle their residents around with something like service every 15-30 minutes depending on the time of the day . This could mitigate the street issues mentioned by Deucey since vans tend to be smaller . I definitely see them in my neighborhood , and they have become so popular with their residents that they have responded with additional service . Of course there are trips that the shuttle buses do n't make , and for those occasions , the residents have the option of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue here is this place has tried to make itself exclusive by being a gated community , and yet it does not offer the services that come with being such a community . Hell if you look at other such cooperatives , not only do they provide shuttle bus service , but they also have their own amenities like banks , supermarkets and the like . This place needs to get with the times . Even the BxM3 could run better . I tutor in a co-op and use the BxM3 and get off right there and see how many people use the bus . Then there are likely folks that use the Metro-North station that have to schlepp up those annoying hills to get home . They just are n't vocal enough . In my area , people started petitions to expand shuttle bus service from the station so that they do n't have to transverse tons of hills and stairs , and I do n't blame them . I take the express bus there to avoid the hills and then walk down to Metro-North to get home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have turned down in the vicinity because of the lack of transportation and hilly topography . That area along with University Heights and Morris Heights have some of the worst transportation options when you consider how hilly they are and how many step streets there are .

Not trying to sound rde to you but this is a topic that been discussed alot in the recent past . <p> A couple of years back right before the economic crisis in 2007 , the proposed extending the BX7 and BX10 to the Ludlow MNRR station in South Yonkers . That was planned was scrapped due to the current crisis . <p> Of the bus routes IMO only maybe the BX20 or BX10 makes the most sense to extend to Getty Sq .

Almost all of the possible ridership for a succesful Getty Sq. -(1)subway connection is on Broadway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 24/7 service between Yonkers and the Bronx subways is a take-over of the Westchester Bee Line .

Either the BL-1 or BL-2 with hourly headways is fine if ever get to that point . So B35 is more of the ridership on Washbourn Ave on the #1 or going to Tudor Woods ?

@@101482064 @5682064/ <h> Comments about the B7 route in Brooklyn <p> Does anyone here ride the B7 route ? This is IMO one of Brooklyn strangest routes as if you never been on it serves as link between Northeast Brooklyn ie. Bed-Stuvy and Southwest Brooklyn i.e Midwood mainly via Kings Highway . <p> During weekdays especially school days , the ridership level is at least good . Many school kids from Bed-Stuvy , Ocean Hill/Brownsville and East Flatbush use it to get to James Madison HS and others on or near Kings Highway . So do riders going ' crosstown ' between various neighborhoods in Brooklyn . <p> However B7 ridership does tank on weekends and on most trips between Halsey/Bway station and East NY Ave . often zero riders use that route on Saturday/Sunday evening . Not to mention this former 24/7 route late evenings ( after 9pm weekdays and after 8pm weekends ) southern terminal is Flatbush/Kings Highway . <p> I am asking should the B7 be extended to serve the new Ridgewood Bus Terminal at the Myrtle-Wycoff when the economic crisis ends ? Also should the B7 run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coney Island Ave/Kings Highway ? Also should the B7 be re-routed and run via Rockaway Ave between East NY Avenue and Broadway ? <p> Personally i think the B7 is one of those routes that badly needs a route restructuring to relieve overcrowding on other nearby routes such as the B6 , B8 , B12 , B46 and B82 but unsure of the solution . In the first ' doomsday ' cuts , if I remember correctly , both late night and weekend B7 was proposed to be gone . Instead only overnight service was canned . <p> Guys feel free to reply . I am sure our Brooklyn bus experts B35 and Checkmate will have something to say on this.:cool : <p> The B7 is one of the most overlooked routes in Brooklyn . Weekdays from Coney Island Av to ENY Av northbound is always SRO . On occasion , you would see them bunch up 2-3 buses at a time . I think it should 've became a limited during rush hours only ( before the B82 became one and before the went kaput ) . Weekends &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for it . One time I caught the last bus from Flatbush Av for the night and rode it all the way home ( end to end ) and I counted 12 people . <p> The B7 is one of the most overlooked routes in Brooklyn .

That way , if there is an issue with one route ( the B60 runs through some narrow streets in East Williamsburg , and , since it is an industrial neighborhood , there is always the chance that it could get stuck behind a truck trying to turn around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , there is always the other route to back it up . <p> For starters I would extend the B7 from CI to Stillwell Av . By doing the u kan make it the Local while all B82 are LTD weekday Between 7:00-10:00 . <p> Or what about as a ' compromise ' extending the B7 to either the Kings Highway/McDonald Ave . station or the Caser Bay 's Shopping Center ( Best Buy ) at Bay Parkway and Belt Parkways ? Personally i think ridership would increase more on the B7 going to Ridgewood than to the neighborhhoods of Coney Island or Bensonhurst myself . B82 just needs better headways/expand limited service to all day weekdays.:eek : <p> It 's very diffcult right now to get from SW Brooklyn to Northern Brooklyn i.e Bed-Stuvy , and Ridgewood via mass transit . That why I am strongly feel the B7 should go to the Myrtle-Wyckoff transit center hub . <p> I think the idea of the B7 extension would be to replace the B82 local . If this happened , the B82 would have to run local on Flatlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue . <p> If the idea of the B7 extension were just to supplement the B82 , the McDonald Avenue would be a poor choice for a terminal . The reason being that the riders coming from points east hit the ( / ( Q ) first at East 16th Street , so there would be relatively few people who would want to continue to the train . Also , even the people between the ( / ( Q ) and would choose the ( / ( Q ) because they run more frequently and go to more desireable places in Manhattan along a more direct route , so the people would still stick with going to the ( / ( Q ) . <p> The Ceasar 's Bay Shopping Center is where the MTA plans to terminate the B82s anyway , so that makes sense as a terminal . <p> The problem with any extension is that the B7 would be extremely long , especially if it came all the way from Ridgewood to Bensonhurst . For cost savings purposes , an extension of the B7 towards Bensonhurst is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient , an extension to Ridgewood combined with moving it to Rockaway Avenue is probably better . <p> So Fresh Pond or anyone how about the idea of extending the B7 to Ridgewood ? Not only it could relieve overcrowding on the B6 , B82 , B35 , B12 and B60 , it could even take riders off the busy and lines for crosstown Brooklyn travel as well . <p> I also find the B7 to be an interesting route . As a route that runs along Kings Highway it acts as both a north-south route and an east-west route . <p> As far as running it along Rockaway Avenue goes , the advantage is that riders who live in between Saratoga Avenue and Rockaway Avenue would have the advantage of the choice between the B7 and B60 to bring them the final few blocks to their home ( if they are transferring from the or , or even the ( J ) / ( Z ) at Chauncey Street ) . <p> Personally , I find it to be an advantage to have 2 routes running on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station ) , instead of a few blocks apart . That way , if there is an issue with one route ( the B60 runs through some narrow streets in East Williamsburg , and , since it is an industrial neighborhood , there is always the chance that it could get stuck behind a truck trying to turn around , or a double-parked car , or just plain traffic ) , there is always the other route to back it up . <p> In that way , it would be helping the B60 in 2 ways : By running with it on Rockaway Avenue to handle people transferring from the subway , and by connecting to the and . <p> The B7 , along with the B26 , and are my home-lines . I as well think it would be a good idea to extend the north terminal to Ridgewood to avoid a transfer to the B26 . Now as far as the B7 using Rockaway Av. instead of T. Boyland would be an inconvenience for me and a few other riders . The last stop on the B7 puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also serves passengers that want to catch the bus between Ralph and Rock Avs . Not only that , but because the B60 has headways of about 10-15 minutes , similar to the B7 's 12-20 , I think the two routes are just fine where they are . I have NEVER seen anyone boarding the B7 on T. Boyland north of Fulton , so that would defeat the purpose of the route running north along Rock Av . I have ridden the B60 many times as well going to and from my brother 's house in Canarsie , ( when I did n't want to catch the and trains ) and I think it 's an ok route and ride . Now yes , some streets are very narrow , but this is a problem along many routes . I ca n't really comment too much on the southern terminal because I can count on one hand how many times I have taken the 7 west of Utica . But I do n't think there is a need for the bus to run to CI Av. at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , but that does n't mean it is n't at times . As far as heading toward my neighborhood , the bus is often SRO during weekday rush hours . <p> EDIT:I can go either way on the rush hour limited issue . The route is only about 45-60 minutes long IIRC , and that is all the way from CI Av. to Bed-Stuy . The limited might save a few minutes , but I do n't think it would be cost effective . <p> You 're points are more valid than mine since you actually live near the B7 , but my logic was that , since the B7 runs fairly infrequently , every 15-20 minutes or so , it would be attract more riders if it ran on the same corridor as another , more frequent route ( in this case , the B60 ) . That way , riders can wait at a bus stop along Rockaway Avenue and take either the B7 or B60 , if their destination is another point on Rockaway Avenue or in the near vicinity . <p> For example , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choice of the B7 or B60 if their destination was as far south as Linden Blvd .

@@101482075 @5682075/ <p> Ok , I have a question . I 'm aware of the upcoming promotion to surface dispatcher exam 4700 which filing starts on July 10th . How does one study and prepare for this test . I have the Passbook " Surface Line Dispatcher " by National Learning Corporation , but I do n't believe the information is relevant . I spoke to a MaBSTOA Dispatcher today and was told the book is a waste of time . You need to know formulas , memorandums , how to calculate pay , etc . So I ask the question again , how can I obtain this information ? Are there classes ? And if so how can I sign up ? <p> The way they do promotional exams these days , they expect you to know the ins and outs of the job you are testing for . You basically have to have already worked the job to get 100% on the exam . Best way to study is to talk to the people who already have that title and learn everything you can from them - see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover ! <p> From what I 've been told we have to study the bulletins , 19A rules &amp; regulations , pay practice , running time , speed calculation and some general contract knowledge .

Healy , state Sen. Nicholas Sacco and City Council members Bill Gaughan and Steven Fulop . <p> Prieto could not say exactly how many riders constitute " enough , " but urged residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to make sure that if we get it for you , you use it , " agreed Hudson County Executive Tom DeGise . <p> But some residents said they are worried that if they stop using jitneys , causing the independent vans to desert the neighborhood , and then NJ Transit changes the route back , it will leave them with no transportation . <p> Asked about that issue yesterday , Healy said that he understands the dilemma and would himself be tempted to use jitneys if he were waiting for a bus . But he said , " If ( Heights residents ) really want the bus service , we would advise them to try to patronize the bus . They 're going to have to make a choice .

How is the #123 doing and is there a Jersey City or Jersey City/Union City fare for this route to PABT ? Wow ! The #84 , 86 and 123 on Palisade Avenue in the Heights . <p> Well , the service starts in a month . From what I hear people do take the 123 . And there 's actually people that take the 84/86 or a jitney to Congress and take the 123 from there when the 10/99S was pulled away from Palisade Avenue .

( Amtrak motors have a switch that changes the voltage from 12.5 KV/60Hz to 12.0 KV/25Hz ) <p> The only things that Metro North would be able to run into Penn currently are M8 sets on the New Haven Line .

The M8s have dual-position shoes that let them operate on either top-contact ( LIRR ) or bottom contact ( MNR ) third rail , which means they could stay under the wire to Sunnyside Yard and then swap to third rail between Sunnyside and Penn Station . As far as Hudson line trains go , they 'd need to refit the Metro-North P32ACDMs with the M8-style dual position shoe to run them into Penn for regular service . <p> As an electrical engineering student , the question about 25Hz to 60Hz is interesting and depends on how the power electronics are set up on the M8s . If the power system rectifies everything to DC and then onboard inverters generate the waveforms to drive the motors ( which I believe is what happens , because the railway supplies single-phase power and the motors are all three-phase ) , then adding 12.5kV 25Hz functionality to the M8 would n't be all that hard . My best guess is that the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 12/25kV down to several hundred or a thousand volts prior to rectifying it into DC for powertrain use . <p> The M8s ' main transformers are sized for 60Hz and are therefore too small to handle 25Hz power . The higher the frequency of AC power , the smaller total amount of electromagnetic flux the transformer has to juggle between cycles . If the amount of flux per mass unit on the transformer core goes too high the core saturates and it stops functioning properly . Thus , the MTA can ( and did ) save weight by picking a transformer sized for 60Hz rather than 25Hz , but that limits them from operating under the wire south of Sunnyside Yard .

The also does n't advertise express bus service in some areas ( which it should ) , but I was thinking about this the other day oddly enough on the express bus coming home to Riverdale . I mean Metro-North gets pretty good ridership for its intermediate parts ( i.e. Westchester to the Bronx , and vice versa ) , but the price is an intermediate price , which I believe should be raised slightly . $3.00 is too low for a premium service .

This time it was the X17 , the previous one being the QM2 . <p> Basically , I took the S79 to the Staten Island Mall to check it out , as I rarely go to Staten Island . Coming back , I decided to take the express bus instead of my original choice to take the bus back to St. George for the ferry . <p> In summary of the ride , it was better than the QM2 for sure . Nice and fast , directly from the Staten Island Mall to Grand Central Terminal . Great ride , I also got one of the 2012 MCI 's so I was glad I did . Overall , I would ride it again ( unlike the QM2 ) as it was a much better ride unlike the QM2 going via Northern ... Definitely was worth $6. 57712 @qwx917712

I have a couple of people who recently won internships from the MTA for IT positions through an IT recruiter for an outside firm . <p> I came from a pretty extensive IT background . Unfortunately , that industry is n't what it was 15 years ago , and we never had any kind of union like most other trades do , so we were often the first ones to get our titles pushed back into freelance or consulting positions . This is the primary reason I made the career change . I may make less per hour as conductor , but the benefits more than make up for that - guaranteed 40+ hours a week of pay , lots of growth , health insurance , a 401K &amp; pension , no more 1099 's , and job security for life ! Sure , you have to put up with A LOT more chit here , but it really is worth it , and having a particular interest in transit definitiely helps things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply for an IT position at the MTA , that since they promote from within I already have my foot in the door there , but nope .... I like RTO and I 'm not going back ! <p> Good thing you brought out the point that IT jobs are outsourced . Currently I survive as a freelancer taking in contracts with many government agencies and private firms . The IT industry is seriously booming in New York as an exception to the bad state of the job market . The catch to this is that they do n't offer benefits in many cases . Maybe I should join the Freelancer 's Union . <p> You might not be as ' outdated ' as you think . You can get ways to find yourself up to date on technology advancements but if you find great satisfaction overall working as a RTO then yeah definitely that 's where you need to be , with the MTA . <p> I 'm very happy in what I do for a living . And the potential to increase your salary to six digits without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if a tech has a computer science degree . But working as a T/O or as a conductor looks like more of a job that will keep one occupied , doing things . It also looks more secure a job . Office jobs in IT can be boring sometimes , and I 'm looking for a challenge . I think being in the MTA could satisfy that need for a challenge . <p> One deterrent from actually going for it is because I know those entrance exams can be intimidating . Not a easy exam . <p> I would personally stick in the IT/Comptuer Programming field , but I happen to prefer an office environment with consistent hours , instead of the round the clock scheduling that the Subway does . Remember when you start at the Subway you 're going to get the crappiest schedulues because of the seniority rules , so be prepared to be working the or the in the middle of the night for example . <p> Realizm and everyone else on the boards confession .

And you be getting a U ( universal ) pass that works on any Mabstoa and NYCT bus or subway station . Beyond that I heard the facilities are better . Other than that I do n't know any other differences . <p> Let 's just say you do go with mta bus , make sure you pick into a depot that 's with twu not atu . If you pick a depot with twu , you would get the same pay scale as mobstoa . The only difference is mobstoa have better pension for now.:tup : <p> Thanks Andrew but if possible do you know advantages of working for mabstoa over mta bus since your already on that side . Thanks again <p> Those I mentioned in my prior post is just about it . I mean the best outta the both would be to work for NYCTA buses . Then you 'd get all of the above mentioned , but have a NYCERS pension which would allow you to transfer your time to another city agency if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had any . Plus you would have civil service status/protection . <p> They use a Defined Pension system which closely matches the NYCERS TA 25/55 pension plan . Only thing is you ca n't bring time over from another city agency and you ca n't take your time to another agency either . I 'm not sure about buying back military time either . Either way you would be better off at MaBSTOA . But remember not only would you be losing seniority if you make the switch , you will also be obligated to complete the full course of the 25/55 since you ca n't bring that bus time over with you . So that may be something to consider if you already put in a significant amount of time with Bus Company and wanted to retire at a certain age . I would say if you 've done less than 5 years with Bus company make the switch , but if you 've done more like closer to 10 then seriously consider the extra years you will have to work .

Nonetheless I 'm sure the service was vital to supplement the X17 and X19 . <p> Yeah , Little Clove Road was basically used as a way to get over to Petrides . So it started at Victory &amp; Clove , served Petrides , then went up Grymes Hill , looped around on Arlo , then came back down and went straight to Victory &amp; Clove . <p> The X18 did n't do anything for X17/19 riders because it served an entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just like the X17/19 . <p> While I agree that the bus route network in Staten is dated , that issue continues to exist and plague other boroughs as well . And from what I 've seen the MTA propose for Staten Island and other boroughs it does n't look like major changes will take place in the near future , and those that will likely wo n't benefit many passengers . <p> So while I agree that service restorations do n't remedy the problem entirely , they are better than nothing at all . And again , have you seen the agency 's plans for Staten Island , the proposals still do n't reflect the travel patterns of residents , so restructuring is n't all that better . <p> That 's what I 'm saying : Restructuring in a way that reflects current travel patterns is better . I do n't think anybody can really dispute that . If it 's 2013 , buses should be adjusted to 2013 travel patterns , not 1930 travel patterns . <p> If the MTA restructures services based on some faulty assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own agenda to fill in which the riders themselves are a secondary ( or tertiary or worse ) concern , then " restructuring is n't all that much better " . <p> I mean , the S54 on the weekends cost almost $8 per passenger , and buses served very few riders . As a taxpayer and fare-paying rider , I want to make sure that money is used efficiently . Does that mean every bus has to be packed ? Of course not , but they should be carrying reasonable loads unless there 's absolutely no alternative to serving the neighborhoods involved , which is n't the case for the most part . <p> Please , surely you 've traveled Forest west of South , or even Victory west of Arlene . There some other pockets out there as well but I ca n't name them off hand . <p> And New York accent ? If anything I 've developed a valley accent as a result all my time in Cali . <p> Well , that 's why I said " deep South Shore or something " . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Greenbelt ( the S54/57 along Rockland ) , and probably some parts of Richmond/Arthur Kill Road by the cemetary , but my point is that most areas do have a sidewalk by the stops . <p> BTW , the S40 along Forest has sidewalks by the stops ( it 's just that in some portions , there 's no sidewalk between the stops , but at the stops themselves , there 's a sidewalk ) . With the S62 , the only portion that I can think of offhand without a sidewalk is that stretch across from Top Tomato . The stops in Travis itself have a sidewalk ( except for maybe those last couple of stops west of the WSE . I do n't know offhand ) , and those few stops between Arlene &amp; Signs have a sidewalk ( with the exception of the westbound stops at Arlene &amp; Signs themselves ) . <p> But even then , those areas are far out and isolated , but they do n't represent the average bus stop on Staten Island . <p> The S60 did n't go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes of its low ridership . It was a shuttle to Victory &amp; Clove where they could take other buses , but it did n't do anything to get to the ferry . <p> I personally think the 40 million dollars should be used for some SI commutes , and other boroughs as well . Regarding the X22 , why do n't  we just give it it 's own midday service instead of having an extended X17 ( long enough pre-extention ) . <p> 0 57713 @qwx917713

Not sure because i am pretty sure if I get called to start conductor processing , they would not excuse me out of a training day to attend any ther position .... I have thought every possible angles and yes I have nothing to lose right now , except a severance at my current job , but that 's ok as long as I know and feel confident to get my foot in the door with MTA ... question still is whether it would be TO or CR .... <p> As for the second part ( can you be hired for a new title while still in training for a different one ) . This question comes up frequently and I 've answered it numerous times here over the years , but unfortunately it is usually found in another thread about something else , after pages and pages of discussion , when it is finally asked ( again ) . Hopefully now that it 's been asked in its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this post here , and the answer will be easier to find in the future. : <p> OK here is THE final definitive answer ( again ) since people are still going back and forth about this issue . <p> As PATCOman said , you can be hired off an open competitive C/R list and and ( later ) an open competitive T/O list , and have it be treated similar to a promotion . If you do n't like it , fail a signal exam , ca n't stop overrunning stations or signals , or otherwise decide or are forced out of the T/O title , you absolutely 1000% have the option of going back provided you do so within your first year as a T/O , and that you passed probation as a C/R before you accepted appointment to T/O . This is all covered under RULE 9B in the first chapter of your rulebook , read it . <p> There is only once circumstance where promotion may actually backfire on an employee . It is difficult to explain but I will try . That is when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotional exam ( #1 we 'll call it ) . -Employee in eligible title takes a second promotional exam ( #2 we 'll call it ) . -Employee accepts promotion from exam #1 to new title . Their previous title was eligible for exam #2 , but the new title they gained by being promoted from exam #1 is not . -Employee is called from exam #2 . In order to accept promotion to the title from exam #2 , they must first accept an on paper demotion back to their original title since their new title from exam #1 is not eligible to promote to the title from exam #2 . <p> In this exact circumstance , if the employee resigns or is demoted out of their title from exam #2 , they would be ineligible to return to the title earned from exam #1 since they would have to return to their " previous title " in such an instance . <p> Case in point : Conductor takes the tower operator and train operator exams . Gets promoted to train operator , then called for tower operator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this person decides they want to be a tower operator , they will have to accept an on paper demotion back to conductor to go to tower operator . If they do n't make it as a tower operator , they would then go back to conductor , and can not go back to train operator . <p> The only other situation where someone can get hurt taking a promotion is if they do not complete probation in an eligible title . <p> Case in point : Cleaner promotes to conductor , then is hired open competitive as a train operator before completing conductor probation . If they ca n't make it as a train operator , they would go back to cleaner , not conductor , since they never completed probation as a conductor . <p> REMEMBER : These rules are specifically designed so they do n't discourage people from taking promotions . However , the promotional lines must be adhered to at all times , and you must pass probation to establish permanent status in any title .

I personally think the confusion of the bus " exploding " was the Associated Press jumping to conclusions , as they also assumed the Drive Away company owned the bus ( probably because the transporter plate used on the bus was registered to the company and listed in the police report and the AP assumed they were the registered owner of the bus ) . <p> I 've delivered these exact propane buses stopping to refuel at UHaul locations and have always worried about the buses running hot at highway speed and having something catch fire next to one of the propane tanks , that looks like what happened here ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the propane tank when it caught fire ) .

@@101482150 @5682150/ <p> the MTA is taking steps that will inhibit the line from serving the borough . <p> Isolating the 2nd Avenue Subway <p> The MTA divided the construction of the 2nd Avenue subway into four segments ( phases ) and commenced work on Phase I ( 63rd St. to 96th St. ) , which benefits the very wealthy Upper East Side . In the planned Phase II ( 96th St. to 125th St. ) , the agency has broken with all previous 2nd Avenue subway plans which proposed a station at 125th St. &amp; 2nd Avenue with the line continuing north into the Bronx . In its current proposal , the MTA turns the line west on 125th St. with the station on an east-west axis to facilitate transfers from Metro North and the Lexington Avenue line . <p> This alignment has grave consequences for the Bronx : <p> As far as the Bronx goes , the east-west station alignment creates a dead end . The 15 " Q " trains from the 63rd St. junction , projected to use the line , would never go to the Bronx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. could split in the Bronx and provide 2 new subway lines in that borough . With the " Q " line marooned in Manhattan , the remaining 2nd Avenue line would have the capacity for only one extension . <p> A bellmouth at 125th St. &amp; 2nd Avenue which the MTA does plan to provide would be totally dependent upon the completion of Phase III ( Houston St.-63rd St. ) and start of the proposed " T " train service . If Phase III is not built , the Bronx wo n't have a new subway . <p> It must be added that this westward extension is extremely expensive . The Phase II tunnels , built in the 1970 's by the cut and cover method are shallow . The western extension , however , would have to go under the Lexington Avenue line , which has 2 levels . This means deep bore tunneling with a super expensive cavern station . All of this for a transfer ! Would n't going into the Bronx serve more people ? Absolutely ! Thus , why is the MTA wasting money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that the MTA has no intention to extend the new subway into the Bronx . The agency hopes that the transfer will add riders to the 2nd Avenue subway , which otherwise , would suffer from low ridership . This is a highly optimistic scenario since riders always prefer the quickest and most direct connection to their destination . They have no time for an additional cruise through the Upper East Side . <p> Not content with making an Bronx extension of the 2nd Avenue subway more difficult , the MTA is taking steps to prevent the Bronx from using its best route : the Amtrak line . <p> Obstructing the Most Effective Bronx Extension Route <p> The Amtrak railroad line traverses the entire eastern part of the Bronx . The roadbed has room for 6 tracks with Amtrak using only two . Furthermore , the line crosses the Bronx in exactly the right areas : Hunt 's Point , Parkchester , the Municipal Hospital Complex and the huge Co-op City housing development . <p> In terms of cost , extending the subway via the Amtrak would save a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , no blasting , no digging , etc . It would be a matter of laying the ties , tracks , the 3rd rail , signals and building stations . The Regional Planning Association ( RPA ) proposed using a part of this route as did the MTA . <p> In the 1970 's , the MTA considered extending the 2nd Avenue subway into the Dyre Avenue line . Trains would have used the Amtrak route to 174th St. and then an elevated connection , remaining from the defunct New York , Westchester &amp; Boston railroad , to the E. 180th St. ( #2 , #5 ) station . At the same time that the agency decided to turn the 2nd Avenue subway west at 125th St. , it also decided to tear down the elevated connection at 174th St. This was done in 2003 ending the possibility of a connection to Dyre Avenue and sending a signal that the MTA no longer wanted to extend the 2nd Avenue subway into the Bronx . <p> Since East Side Access will allow LIRR trains to go directly to Grand Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MTA wants to run Metro North commuter trains from Connecticut on the same tracks as Amtrak to Penn Station . Since the roadbed has room for 6 tracks , this in itself would be no problem . The 2nd Avenue subway could use the other four tracks . <p> Recently , however , the MTA has revived a 2006 proposal ( Kappstatter ) to build four Metro North stations directly on the Amtrak trackbed and thus , block its use for a 2nd Avenue subway extension ! It would improve the commute for the 1% while preventing one for the 99% . Would the commuter train alone make a difference for the Bronx ? <p> Currently , the Metro North Harlem line runs directly through the center of the Bronx . The ride is prohibitively expensive and thus , few Bronx residents benefit . It has a few stations but aside from Fordham Road , they are so little used that most trains simply bypass them . No entrepreneurs established any significant companies along the route knowing that without a subway , the area would be unattractive to good employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amtrak . The proposed stations would not attract many riders and would mostly be bypassed . The only exception is the Bronx Municipal Complex where the station would be very useful for wealthier doctors and hospital administrators but not to hospital workers or the families of patients . <p> What makes the MTA Metro North station proposal so galling is that the Amtrak line can accommodate both " amazingly , a project for the 100%--if the planning process is done right : The Metro North station at the Municipal Hospital complex should be built to accommodate both Metro North and 2nd Avenue trains . Parkchester and Hunt 's Point may not need Metro North stations at all if these two areas are served by the 2nd Avenue extension . At Co-op City the 2nd Avenue subway would leave the Amtrak and via a short tunnel enter the heart of Co-op City . A Metro North station built north of this point would not pose any conflict . <p> If the stations are built on the trackbed , however , they will block the best and most inexpensive route for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension to be dug elsewhere at enormous expense . Taken together with its plans for Phase II , it 's clear that the MTA does n't want the Bronx to have a new subway . <p> I do n't  think they wanted to build a rather lengthy transfer ( think the fabled PABT Times Sq transfer tunnel in length ) , but rather have passengers go right downstairs and find the tail end of a . Remember that 2Av is two blocks away from Lexington , not one . Lex to 3rd is n't as long as 3rd to 2nd , but its not like its a city block either .

The Lexington riders get the front end . <p> He 's not talking about that , though . <p> If the MTA built a station at 125th Street/2nd Avenue ( which is not the plan ) , you 'd have Lexington Avenue riders going through a long passageway between 2nd Avenue and Lexington Avenue and catch the back end of the . <p> Under the current plan , yes the station would be at 125th Street/Lexington Avenue , and apparently it would be on the western side of Lexington Avenue , so riders from the on Lexington Avenue get the front end , and riders from the Metro-North on Park Avenue get the back end .

Here are some key reasons why this , and not a full blown extension to Secaucus , is the right choice . <p> 1 . COST -- tunneling under the Hudson River is going to be expensive enough as it is . Why tunnel for nearly 4 miles deep underneath Hoboken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could cut the tunneling by over 50% and just end at Hoboken . The purpose of the ARC train in Secaucus was two fold , 1 ) to create another tunnel into Penn Station , and 2 ) provide riders from NJ Transit points north a one seat ride into the city . With the ARC tunnel declared dead , the 7 train to secaucus proposal solves neither of these problems . The Hoboken connection , however , provides a much better alternative .... <p> 2 . HOBOKEN CONNECTIONS-- Hoboken Terminal is home to more rail , ground , and water transit lines than any other metropolitan area transit center . Secaucus provides links to all of the NJ transit lines , but no local rapid transit lines or subways . In addition , its isolated from residential and commercial development . Penn Station on the other hand is home to ALMOST all NJ Transit lines , and two subway connections . However , it is operating way beyond peak capacity , suffers from a poor design , and is overcrowded . No one likes Penn Station . Hoboken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NJ Transit lines , the PATH train , Hudson Bergen Light Rail , Hudson Ferries , and with some luck , a NYC subway connection . In addition , Hoboken , unlike Secaucus , is a growing and lively city in its own right . A submerged subway link within Hoboken Terminal would provide direct access to Midtown , including the EAST SIDE , to ALL NJ Transit lines , the expanding Hudson Bergen Light Rail , and PATH Train . No other option on the table provides this kind of transit access . <p> 3 . ALLEVIATE PENN STATION-- an ARC tunnel to Penn Station would NOT have helped alleviate Penn Station . It would have increased traffic through the station , and would have done nothing to modify the actual Penn Station layout . Hate to say it , but with the " renovation " of MSG , instead of its relocation , Moynihan Station ai n't  happening , and Penn Station is here to stay in its current form . But , what if you could divert a portion of Penn Station traffic to Hoboken Terminal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Midtown West AND Midtown East . Problem solved . Let 's clear up Penn Station traffic . The ARC Tunnel did n't offer that option . <p> 4 . HIGH LINE FAR WEST SIDE DEVELOPMENT -- A southern extension of the 7 Train , which currently has rail spurs to 25th street , would allow for a 14th Street / 11th Avenue subway stop , which could eventually connect to an extended L train . With the growth of the Meatpacking District , installation of the new Whitney Museum , increasing construction in that area , and upcoming opening of the High Line phase 2 , what better place to have a new subway link to Midtown West and Midtown East . MTA commuters could take a train from Tarrytown or New Rochelle to Grand Central , and hop on a subway to the Meatpacking District . Currently , the closest subway to that area is the L/ACE train at 14th and 8th , about a 15 minute walk . In terms of cost and construction , the intersection of 14th Street , 11th Avenue , and 10th Avenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupting traffic . There are several onramps which could be temporarily disabled , and a large park . The current 7 train extension to Secaucus proposal could also integrate this subway link . <p> 5 . DIRECT SUBWAY LINK TO NEWARK AIRPORT / MEADOWLANDS / XANADU -- NJ has invested greatly in the Meadowlands NJ Transit stop , the Newark Airtran and Newark Airport NJ Transit stop , and ( the seemingly worthless ) Xanadu project . If you want to open up access to these points in a greater volume , more efficiently , and at less cost , a 7 train extension to Hoboken could eventually connect through to the existing NJ transit lines , proving the public with a direct subway link to these points . This could drastically cut transit times to Newark Airport , the Meadowlands Sports Complex , and Xanadu , making them more attractive than the hour long trip to JFK or bus/subway combo to LaGuardia . Not to mention , the Nets are picking up to leave to Brooklyn . If you want to entice future franchises to the aging IZOD center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also include a direct subway link to the Meadowlands Sports NJ Transit stop . <p> 6 . HOBOKEN vs . SECAUCUS -- When you think of Secaucus , you think of a place where the mafia takes their recent victims . When you think of Hoboken , you think of 20 somethings celebrating St. Patty 's day , but also an up and coming community , with local links to Weehawken , Port Imperial , West New York , Jersey City , Harrison , and Newark . Why not utilize the existing infrastructure and help expand these parts to benefit both New Jersey and New York . The Secaucus option does not aim to do this , nor would it do this . <p> I am not a graphic artist , but I made a little mockup of the planned route . I have scribbled several track map ideas for the connections with the L train , and at Hoboken Terminal , being that the 7 and L are A and B series transit lines , and would not be able to share a platform with one another without some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both share rail tracks and a terminus station with multiple platforms , like at the current Hoboken PATH terminus . <p> A ) Your proposal wo n't happen because the is an IRT line and the is a IND/BMT line . They both have different car length and widths although it might work if it 's a bi-level tunnel which wo n't happen because it would be expensive.B ) You have just drawn another map that someone else on the forums and on their website has drawn a long time ago named Vanshnookenraggen .. C ) The extension plan is to Secaucus not Hoboken though it might be interesting if the extension to New Jersey would travel through Hoboken and Journal Square all the way to Secaucus with stations , it could be three tracked and the could serve as an express.D ) A better proposal would be the which has 75 ft BMT/IND cars which are wider and longer so it could handle the passengers from New Jersey . <p> How about just extend the and trains ? The is too narrow , and , as stated above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend the MNR New Jersey Lines to somewhere in Manhattan ( i.e. Grand Central ) . <p> The might be ' too narrow ' , but at least it goes to a lot more interesting places than the does ( Javits Ctr , Times Sq , Grand Central ... ) . That 's why a extension would be much more viable than an extension of the line . Platforms at all the Manhattan stations would have to be lengthened and widened to cope with the extra passenger load . Not to mention the installation of more escalators to and from the platforms . So all in all , a extension would still comprise a lot more than just boring a tunnel right into NJ . <p> Why would PATH extend to Grand Central when they canceled ARC 2 months back ? . A better idea is to extend the current PATH from Penn Station to Grand Central . It 's cheaper then digging a whole new tunnel under the Hudson , and they could branch off the curent PATH line near Secaucus to Secaucus knocking off two birds in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoboken Extension if they use PATH because PATH already serves Hoboken . <p> Anyway I thought up of this idea instead . The would be extended to New Jersey using the current 14th Street station . It would run from there to Hoboken Terminal , Pavonia-Newport , Jersey Avenue , Journal Square , and etc all the way to Secaucus . Then they can extend the current , to 14th Street and create a transfer point from the to the , which still allows people to get to Grand Central . <p> Anyway these extensions to New Jersey would not be given money from the . It would have to be given state and national permission . Also it would have to be paid for by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . <p> D ) A better proposal would be the which has 75 ft BMT/IND cars which are wider and longer so it could handle the passengers from New Jersey . <p> You 're actually wrong . The uses 60 ' ft equipment 8 cars long , for a total of 480 ft . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 560 ' of 11 cars of the . Now the L has those wide body cars 143/160 and while packed , still has a roomier feel than the boxy-like 62A 's . However , by time such a plan was executed , built and put into service , who knows what cars the line would run by then .

Usually the X10B , X12 , X42 and X17A , X17C , X19 and any other express bus that uses the SIE for an extended period of time will use the upper level since it allows them to get to the SIE once they get past the tolls . The other buses will usually use the lower level , but nothing is written in stone on that . I 've seen some drivers use the upper level when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the weather is really bad or there is a great deal of fog or wind , then the upper level may not be an option , forcing all buses to use the lower level and those who need the SIE have to make their way over to it cutting across lanes and such , which always amazes me . The X12 and X10B for example use the SIE up to Slosson and they have to make their way from the HOV lane over which is in the furthest left hand lane and then cross over to the furthest lane on the right hand side to get to the service road . With the maniac drivers on Staten Island I 'm always amazed that no buses get into accidents doing that because many B/Os do n't even slow down when crossing lanes . lol <p> 2 ) Drop-offs work differently from Bus and NYCT .

On Staten Island , most stops are labeled , but there are a few where they just drop off at the stop where it 's closest ( for instance , on the X10/11 at Victory Blvd &amp; Willowbrook Road , they just drop off at the S62/92/93 stop even though it does n't say " X10/X11 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions:1 ) Say , by some superweird coincidence they need to run an express bus model on a local route , how is the farebox programmed to deduct $2.25 and not $5.50 from the MetroCard ? 2 ) I have never been on the express bus , so I always wonder , does the bus operator stop at every drop-off stop , or is there some sort of stop request system ? 3 ) Are bus operators required to use a certain level on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge ? <p> Thanks ! <p> 1 . ) I think the B/Os can reprogram the bus farebox to make it $2.25 .

Never should a ( S62 ) full route between the Ferry and Travis ' loop ' inside CSI especially on Sundays and overnights when no classes are held . <p> As an 1-time Kingsborough college student , the terminal for the ( B1 ) and ( B49 ) can be as much as 1/2 mile from the Oriental Blvd stop and yet I do n't hear them screaming to extend it to the heart of the KCC campus . <p> As an 1-time Kingsborough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( B49 ) can be as much as 1/2 mile from the Oriental Blvd stop and yet I do n't hear them screaming to extend it to the heart of the KCC campus . <p> They do not want the buses . I believe the MTA wanted to extend the buses into campus at one point . <p> I agree with the others . Only the S93 and select S62s that start at CSI should do the loop . The S93 is clearly geared for CSI students since their final stop is there so why not do the loop ? Other than that nothing more . CSI should be forking over more money if they 're getting more enrollments instead of trying to hoard the money . If they spend more money , they 'll look to pass on more costs to the students . Typical and disturbing . <p> Also if CSI students want a faster commute , use the X10 . You ca n't expect the road to paved with gold when you only have silver . Where is the student representative in this issue ? At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mall and other places because WE paid for it , which is what should be happening w/CSI . If transportation is so important to CSI students then the student representatives can have more monies set aside for transit issues and the college can also fork over some money ; be it for the private bus service , or the bus services ( maybe students can get a discount on the express bus or they can give the monies to extend the S93 and select S62s serving the college ) . I know student discounts were ended to my knowledge , but I 'm sure the would be willing to work something out if it means more money for them , esp . since they claim they 're broke . I would NOT however extend any express buses into the college , so the X10s would keep their normal route , not unless their final destination was CSI . They could extend those X10s into the college . <p> I think the S93 should just be extended into the College , not the other routes . The majority of the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for the S62 short turns at CSI , I do n't think it 's really needed since the ferry shuttle already kinda does that job since it stops near 1P . <p> The S93 is a better candidate because since many students use it to go the college , but I think it should just make the loop around 1P similar the the ferry shuttle rather than going around the entire campus . 
@@101482164 @5682164/ <h> How the LIRR can beat Hampton Jitney <p> The LIRR offers a quicker , cheaper way to travel than Hampton Jitney to and from the East End . But , the service on the Montauk branch is inadequate . The 1st problem is the lack of trains on weekdays and weekends going east in the morning . The 1st train does n't get out there until 10:46am . Going back west on weekdays , if you miss the 2:51pm you 're stuck there until10:38pm . And even for those commuting to the city from the south fork , service ai n't  great , there 's only 1 full time rush hour train at 5:39am . And for those who may want to take a trip into the city on a weekend , the train in the evening wo n't get them home until midnight ! Then there 's the problem on Montauk trains that bypass Nassau county altogether , which is not only stupid and pointless , but also throws away opportunities to get ppl to use the LIRR within Long Island . So I have spent some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill in the gaps . Most of these trains will be added on weekends , when more equipment is available . To have enough equipment , the LIRR needs to consider leasing some equipment , Metro-North , NJT , or Amtrak may have spare coaches and locos .

They send limited services , since those who the LIRR consider as demand mostly take the Jitney . If they want to get improved service , they must market the service as targeting Hampton Jitney directly . Which I 'm not sure if it 's legal , since it illegal for them to take taxpayer subsidies to fight a private company . <p> As for trackage , the current single track with sidings is good enough under the aforementioned plan , even though there may be a restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other trains will have to hold .

On the other hand , the Jitney has a problem on the western half of its run with severe highway traffic . Instead of competing , why not jointly solve the problem by running an intermodal service ?

@@101482189 @5682189/ <p> As everyone knows . Staten Island has the heaviest amount of automobile usage in New York City . It is the only borough without subways running . The only location where there is even transit is the SIR . So should the SIR or the NYC Subway be extended to Staten Island . There has been proposals before that asked for a tunnel to Staten Island in fact a plan from the 1920 's mention a tunnel to Staten Island . There was no commitment so the tunnel was only partially built . The shafts and the tunnel exist under Owl Heads Park . The other idea was proposed in 1917 . It was a tunnel between Staten Island and Manhattan though today this tunnel would be expensive . <p> It would n't be a bad idea to have a subway/El , or light rail added to SI , but that 's not likely going to happen in our lifetime . First we need to get the built ! <p> Exactly . I 'm all in favor of a subway extension to Staten Island but at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now , maybe . Damn , my life will be basically half over by the time a ril link is built between Manhattan and Staten Island . <p> The Fort Hamilton Parkway alignment would be pretty good . It would restore the direct connection between the West End and Culver Line and fill in a gp in Borough Park . <p> If I were designing it , I would have the Staten Island Line run up 16th Avenue instead of Fort Hamilton Parkway , so it would connect directly to the Church Avenue station and assume a role of either Culver Local or Culver Express . <p> As far as the other alignments go , if it ran on the 4th Avenue Line , it would pretty much have to run on the local track . The express track would be full to capacity with the ( D ) / ( N ) trains ( though I think at one point , the ( / ( M ) / ( N ) all ran on the express track ) . <p> I just do n't like the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing capacity rather than spending extra money building a tunnel for a line that does n't run too frequently ( even if headways were doubled , that would still leave the SIR with 15-minute off-peak headways ) . I do n't know what is there to see in Governors Island that merits a whole subway line going there . <p> By the way , does anybody have an estimate of how much the travel time would be on each of the alignments ? <p> It 's true . It might be better off running down 14th Avenue and turn west once it reaches 86th Street . When the Triboro RX is ever created it would have connection to the 62nd Street Station where it meets the , , and the ( X ) . Once it runs west it could also connect to the train at 86th St. Have the ( Mx ) brought back . Bring back the . Allow a new crosstown the . Run them on the upper level . Have the gain a crossover north of Church Avenue and make it run local and have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend the and the to LaGuardia Airport so passengers can switch to lines running to Manhattan . Once the and the run on to Staten Island it can run on the SIR . The would run along the North and West Shore . The would run on most of the East Shore . Both of them would terminate at Tottenville . Once Staten Islanders get off at Church Avenue they could transfer to the and the . <p> The Staten Island Railway is under the regulation of the FRA , which requires different standards of equipment , signaling , ect. from your average subway line . In order for it to be considered a subway line ( in the eyes of the government ) they would have to change a lot of things . <p> By the way , a light rail from St George to New Jersey ( with a connection to HBLR ) is a lot cheaper and realistic than a subway connection . While it would help SI a lot , there just simply is n't the political will for anything like what Vanshnookenraggen proposes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel to the SIR and the North Shore Branch . With a new West Shore Line . Create a new rail yard and subway station at Tottenville . Leave the SIR and extend it around Staten Island and create a Staten Island loop . The SIR can help people that use the which uses most of the East Shore Branch but wo n't run to the Staten Island Ferry . The would serve the Staten Island Ferry and run along the West Shore and North Shore all the way to Tottenville.

It 's just a matter of putting a transponder on a bus , linking that to a system that recognizes what bus it is and connecting it to a GPS network . It 's a bit more involved with the subway because it 's underground and therefore can not rely on GPS . Sure , they could in theory get the South Brooklyn lines and parts of the Eastern Division online with GPS , but with most of the system below ground , that kind of tracking would be useless for most of the lines , especially the fully underground ones like the and . That 's why the real-time B-Division train arrivals pilot only came about after in-station WiFi was fully installed .

@@101482204 @5682204/ <h> Creating Subway Route Bullets Using XML and SVG Files <p> Not the typical thread posted in this subforum . Consider this a bit of a tutorial for those looking to make their own custom route bullets or signs . <p> So , in an attempt to create some signs for my Alternate Subway History , I decided to get a bit into graphical design . My plans require route bullets that obviously are not currently used in the system , so I was in a bit of a predicament as to how to make them . I tried starting with ones that I could simply recolor , but this did not go as well as I 'd hoped . <p> Note the clear artifacts on the bullet , as it was an attempt to recolor from the normal 8th Avenue colors that the bullet once bore . Antialiasing on the text made this a pain in the tail , so I ultimately felt it would be easier to make my own . <p> I knew going into this that the uses Helvetica as their font system-wide , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found image editing for this purpose to be extremely finicky and tedious and I wanted a somewhat more precise way to go about it , so I looked into SVGs . <p> Turns out that SVG files are just fancy XML . XML , being relatively similar to HTML , was easy for me to pick up , so I was able to create images using markup code with some experimentation . The process for me went something like this : <p> 1 . Create a circle . ( I created a 100px circle on a 120px canvas as it is very versatile in scaling , but you can do whatever you feel would work ) 2 . Set the circle to be the proper color ( I pulled official colors from this page on Wikipedia , save for 2nd Avenue and 6th Avenue which I sampled directly from a bullet using the eyedropper tool in GIMP ) . 3 . Add text for the route letter/number . ( Helvetica Bold , 70px , should reflect the size of your circle ) <p> 4 . Estimate x/y alignment for text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it natively supports SVGs but most anything should work ) 4 . Readjust alignment if necessary . Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the letter/number appears relatively centered . <p> As you can tell , it 's a bit of a crapshoot and ultimately the bullets are n't perfect . Perhaps it 's a bit more accurate since misaligned bullets are surprisingly common on signs , even ones made today . I think the ones I have made are relatively accurate , and if they are n't , I welcome someone to make the alignments a bit more precise . <p> Here 's the same sign above remade with the new bullets : <p> Using XML you can essentially create your own bullets . To help anyone else who might want to do this , I 've provided a ZIP file here that has bullets for each letter within ( All current official bullets plus a couple for my own fantasy plan . Any unused letters I simply made white on black. ) as well as a text file containing the hex values for the colors of all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullets in any text editor . I would personally recommend Notepad++ if you 're on Windows or TextWrangler if you 're on OS X. <p> SVG files are great for route bullets because they can be easily scaled without loss of quality , so you can create bullets for use on signs or as avatars . They 're also far smaller than normal images since they 're just markup text ultimately , so they 're also efficient . <p> Here 's a bullet which is completely original in letter and color , for the Triboro RX : <p> I should note that I 'm not taking requests , mostly because this post serves to help people create their own bullets by themselves .

I 'd say very likely ... The problem is it was never official . Perhaps this is something that the should look at keeping . I agree that it is very helpful , given how many Staten Islanders travel to and from Bay Ridge due to family , etc . <p> That 's not what I was referring to . What we 're talking about is that X17 stop is supposed to be pick-up going to Manhattan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT supposed to pick up passengers when dropping off in Bay Ridge , but what has been happening is many folks that commute from Bay Ridge to Staten Island do so now using that X17 drop-off stop . They get on there to go back to Staten Island , and get the X17 going towards Manhattan , but instead of getting off in Manhattan , they get off at the Bay Ridge pick up stop . That X17 stop was only supposed to exist to replace the X28 on weekends , and I know this because I got word of the restoration directly from Senator Golden 's office years ago when this happened .

For NYC Transit , Bus Operator is an open-competitive examination , and the only way to get promoted to conductor is from a cleaner position .

At one time I was told that you were only allowed to make two transactions at one time and then they would block the card automatically for something like five days .

If they completely ignored the local network , there 's going to be problems , I can promise them that .... <p> The only way I 'd support this is if they shut down the road to cars during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I 'd say the absolute opposite and say that the X1 is the first route that needs to be restructured . It 's a Downtown/Midtown combo route that makes all stops throughout the whole island . <p> Taking a glance at the map ( which BTW , the original map is a little off . For example , off the top of my head , I see they 're missing the X30 AM routing via South Avenue &amp; Goethals Road North ) , it looks like they 're trying to do the following ( for peak service anyway ) <p> X1 eliminatedX2 extended to Hylan &amp; Richmond ( and possibly rerouted to run down 5th instead of Lexington ) X3 extended to the ETC , and sent to Worth Street instead of the WFC.X4 eliminatedX5 eliminatedX7 goes up the FDR Drive to Midtown ( likely 5th/Madison ) . Routing in Great Kills tweaked to run the length of Giffords Lane.X8 goes to Worth Street . Routing in Great Kills tweaked to run the length of Giffords Lane.X9 eliminatedX10 eliminatedX11 remains as-isX12 terminates at Worth StreetX14 terminates at Worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversion eliminated.X17A cut back to ETCX17J extended to Annadale RoadX19 rerouted to run the length of Huguenot AvenueX21 increased frequency , and runs up 5th/Madison instead of across 42nd.X22A &amp; X22 Park-and-Ride loop eliminated . Also , X22 runs straight to Bloomingdale Road instead of traveling via Rossville Avenue.X23 runs the length of Rossville Avenue/Seguine Avenue/Foster Road and terminates at Hylan &amp; SharrottX24 runs the length of Arden Avenue and terminates at Hylan &amp; Barclay . <p> My thoughts ( aside from the fact that I 'm waiting for the local section to be released ) <p> The World Financial Center is a big stop on the X7/9/10B . I do think at least one route should serve it . I also think that the lack of ridership between Worth &amp; 23rd is exaggerated . I would have at least a Hylan Blvd route and the X10B run up West Street and Spring/6th ( northbound ) Broadway/Houston ( southbound ) to/from 23rd Street . I do absolutely agree , however with the idea of starting buses at Worth Street instead of the WFC . <p> I 'm not wild about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what I 've seen , most of the ridership is south of Water/Wall ( inclusive ) . Still , I 'd run at least a Hylan Blvd route up there ( likely just leave the X8 as-is ) . <p> I see what they 're trying to do with Father Capodanno ( trying to match it up with Giffords Lane ridership-wise ) . The thing is that those buses do n't run on Father Capodanno for the ridership , but rather because it 's a quicker route to get to points south of Midland . So whatever time people save by waiting a couple of minutes less for a bus , they will likely lose by making more stops on Hylan . <p> The X15 does n't get much ridership in Great Kills ( most people take the X7/8 , which BTW I think should retain their routing down Armstrong/Leverett as it avoids traffic on Arthur Kill and better-serves the neighborhood ) , so I think the diversion to Clarke Avenue does more good than harm , as it better-serves people in that part of Richmondtown . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main Midtown route for the North Shore . It 's the alternative for X42 Midtown passengers in Mariners Harbor , and X14 Midtown passengers in Westerleigh/West Brighton . The problem is that it does n't go south of 42nd Street in Manhattan . <p> I guess they 're really trying to minimize overlap by routing the X42 to Port Richmond . It would serve Midtown passengers on the X14 in that area . As you go further north along Port Richmond Ave , though , it becomes all about the local bus . I do n't think there 's anymore ridership to be gained by running to Richmond Terrace as opposed to Castleton &amp; Jewett where the depot is . <p> The X19 is the only Downtown route on the deep South Shore , and apparently they want it to stay that way . There should be a Downtown version of the X22 . Also , the X23 should probably be routed to Hylan &amp; Craig ( and the X22 cut back to the same place ) since it would be quicker than doubling back on the X22 via Amboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say about the X17J taking over the X17A route in Annadale . Maybe it 's a typo . <p> Also , the X31 should end at Windham Loop ( arguably , if the X21 is going to be beefed up that much , so should the X17J ) . <p> I do hope there 's some compromises ( such as more frequent weekend service , later spans on the North Shore express routes , and some form of the X10 and/or X17 running overnight )

@@101482245 @5682245/ <p> Concentrated routes can be frequent , but what the likes to leave out is that is that if there 's a problem on that one corridor that service is focused on then you have another problem . I also think that they should not just concentrate all of the service in Midtown and Downtown . What they are trying to do is say to hell with the people below 23rd street . You can take the subway . There is too much ridership south of 23rd street not to serve those riders . You could resolve this by having a branch run from 23rd street and then run closed door where the Downtown variants would start . If they do that then I think it could improve service overall . <p> It should also be pointed out that some of these routes were created by the due to them cutting service , so they created part of the problem . Why in the hell are you running the X17 to Tottenville when you could just run the X22 ? Why have the X14 be stuck in traffic serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variant like they did before ? They talk out of both sides of their mouths . First it was oh , we need to cut Downtown service because they 're is n't enough ridership . Well if the buses came as scheduled then there would be . The X13 and X16 were atrocious . Drivers did n't know the routes and often times buses were a no-show , so when they talk about the routes being " too confusing " , maybe they need to train the drivers better as well . The passengers often times know the routes better than the drivers . <p> Where 's the local bus portion of this ?

The lady I spoke with actually brought over a manager to hear my complaint and to confirm my suspicions . After hearing my story , he agreed that I should 've only been charged $1.00 , not the $7.00 that the ticket collector was trying to charge . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON the train and NOT anywhere else as the ticket collector suggested . What 's shocking to me is I 've had that guy before numerous times , both at night and on weekends and he does n't look like he 's that new , but sure acted like he was . He had a hand held device and kept referring to that as if it knew that I already had the off-peak ticket . All sorts of ridiculous in that . Not only did I lose the $6.00 , but the next stop was Spuyten Duyvil ( it was a semi-express train ) , so I had to get off at 125th and take the subway down to the BxM1 to get home and waste another $6.50 , not to mention get arriving home much later than I should 've . I should 've stayed on and protested to be honest , but I thought I had already made it clear to the guy what I was asking for and what the policy was , and that he was too dense to know what the actual rule was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be filing a complaint , gave me the link info ( not that I needed it since I already know where to go ) , and said that someone higher up would definitely be reviewing it and speaking with that guy .

Had you been charged the on board fare it would have been $13.00 . <p> From a personal moral standpoint , this is asinine under this circumstance . As you have essentially been charged close to double of a single ride ticket . In these circumstances I would have not accepted your presented ticket but just charge you the ride extension of $7.00 as there is not such thing as a $1.00 ride extension . <p> From my personal experience , charging a ride extension is a rip off when handed a same zone ticket .

I also do n't understand why you would be allowed to not accept the ticket ? Why should I have to pay $7.00 more for a new ticket when I have a perfectly good one that expires in June that I want to get rid of ? That 's also asinine . It seems to me that aside from some ticket collectors not being educated about the policy , the other issue is each person doing their own thing . Totally absurd . Had you done what you suggested , I would 've protested again and insisted on paying the $1.00 difference . <p> This is the second time this has occurred . Another time I was on a peak train from Spuyten Duyvil to Grand Central . In this case , I actually had a peak ticket , but I had misplaced it and could n't find it when the ticket collector came . I pulled out another ticket from my wallet by accident and gave that to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that case he too charged me the on board price because he deducted the difference from the other ticket and charged me the penalty , and in that instance I did n't protest because I was n't familiar with the policy at the time ( this happened before the latest fare hike ) and I needed to get to the office . If it happens again , I 'm going to look for something in writing that shows what the policy is according to Metro-North because it 's insane to keep getting ripped off like this , not to mention embarrassing . I had people looking at me as if I had done something wrong , when I was in the right . Totally unacceptable . <p> When I say " step up " , I 'm using the wrong but I 'm really referring to the bump up in the price , but I used the correct term with him .

I do n't think it would serve much of a Manhattan-Bound purpose , because you have the there , and the you could pick up at the next stop ; Court Square/23 St. But I still see what you mean ; their so close , why not add the transfer .. <p> There 's plenty of places that could use an OOS transfer .

When SBS and overcrowding are bought up in the same sentence on here it 's generally one route being addressed ( one that paulrivera and I happen to know quite a bit about ) .

The Hempstead line makes a ton of stops like a subway , so why is it so much more expensive ? Is it because of all the LIRR ticket takers per train and the salary , pension , health benefits , etc they get ? Does the electricity cost 5 times as much to haul the LIRR versus the D train ?

You can always go to the first appoitment , and talk to them in person , just do n't  come for the second appoitment , this way they will drop you from the list , and you will be able to add yourself back in the future . <p> Thanks for this advice . So should I just not show up at all for the second , or just tell them at the first appoint I want to put a hold on the application ? <p> The MTA does not recognize point-reduction classes/certificates ... you ca n't have more than 4 points , and they only check back 3 years . So if you get called for the job before Dec. 2013 , they will tell you to call back when you hit the 3 yr mark and they will re-instate your list # , as long as they do n't exhaust that list by/b4 then . <p> Same thing happened to me . I had to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they had a hiring freeze . Got called back like 6 months later I think .. <p> Thanks for the post . So just to clearify , yes , i know the DMV removes the points after 3 years the next calander year . So although dec 2013 makes 3 years , they may not drop them until January 2014 . So as soon as I check with DMV and they confirm the points are removed then and only then is when I call back the MTA and ask to be reinstated ? Or do I have to wait until they contact me back provding there is still an opening and they have not exausted the list ? <p> when that time comes , go tothe dmv and geta copy of your drivers record .. think it is called an abstract . if the ticket is gone , call human resources and see whenyou can go back in and bring back all your paperwork. go to your current appointment and let them tell you the deal . when the ticket is off you have to call them . they wont call you . 
@@101482326 @5682326/ <h> My ' Unofficial ' Guide to NYC Subway stations with no free crossovers <p> This is an unofficial list of subway stations around the city , which does n't allow any free transfer to trains going the other direction ( in other words , not being able crossover to the opposite-bound platform , without having to exit the turnstyle , and then using your MetroCard to the other side ) .

Corrections uses NYCERS , and so does TA . You 'll be in tier 4 which you currently are in , under the 25/55 plan . Also TA does n't age discriminate . Just a couple of years ago they hired a 78 year old conductor . Since you already work for a city agency , once called you 'll get through the process much quicker then newly hired civil service employees would . At age 45 you 'll only need to do an additional 15 years to retire with full benefits .

Prospect ave and Pompton Ave. , which will take you to Newark Penn Station , where you can catch the PATH , NJT 108 , or NJT Trains . The 75 can also take you to Willowbrook Mall , a major bus stop where there is the 191 , 194 , 195 , 196 , 197 , and 198 that will reach NYC Port Authority in about 35 minutes ( depending on traffic ) <p> The only thing that is stopping me from giving you an accurate description is where exactly you 're located , but that 's fine since I 'm not expecting you to do so .

So , I would also check PATH trains too , since they will take you to Newark , and you can take the 29 bus to Verona/Bloomfield Ave or the 11 bus / 28 bus to Pompton Avenue . <p> Just a reminder : I 'm telling you from experience when I was a driver .

Another 2-3 years after that , you will start to see weekends off on the AM tour .

Conductors can promote to Train Operator , Tower Operator , Assistant Train Dispatcher , or work out of title by applying for resume positions . However , each time you take a promotion , your seniority will reset to zero for your new title . Your transit seniority will of course run continuous ( so you will accrue increased vacation allowances as you merit them ) , but your options when you " pick " in a new title you 've promoted to will be contingent on your seniority in that title only , not seniority in any previous titles .

A : Well there is still a few steps you need to go through before you get hired . First You need to take the psychological ( BOSS ) exam . Then you also need to take your drug test and your medical examination .

Do not expect to receive anything except the next notice to come in for the drug test . <p> Q : I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MTA 's medical exam . What should I do ? A : The first thing you should do is be honest with yourself and your doctor as to what is wrong with you . Go to your doctor and have him " clear " you to go to the MTA . In other words , if you have had problems with high blood pressure , make sure you lower it and have your own doctor test you before you go to the MTA . Once he tests you and he feels you are ok , make him write you a note and bring that note to the MTA the day the mta is testing you . Also another tip : Do n't be quick to release information to the mta about your health . Only unless its necessary . The MTA can use what you tell them against you . <p> Q : How hard is the psychological ( BOSS ) exam ? A : Its not really hard at all .

@@101482391 @5682391/ <h> $5B+ to Rebuild Penn Station to Previous Grandeur - Transit Group <p> Calling a mulligan on one of the worst architectural decisions in the history of New York would not be a cheap endeavor in the slightest . With his record breaking 36 sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden , Billy Joel seems to own Eighth Avenue between West 31st and West 33rd Streets . And moving the Piano Man " even a few blocks away " would n't be economically sound . A report released today by the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management suggests relocating the arena to a nearby location would cost upwards of $5 billion , take a particularly long time and become an urban planner 's worst nightmare . The findings are part of the think tank 's study of a recently proposed overhaul of Pennsylvania Station and its extension to the James A. Farley Post Office opposite Eighth Avenue . <p> Let 's just turn the Farley building into " New Penn " then . Madison Square Garden was just renovated less than 5 years ago , just the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only reason this is even an issue is because the city sat on the air rights above Penn Station ever since PRR sold the air rights to the city which ironically led to the original Penn Station 's demolition in the first place . The city gives MSG a permit to operate from there and its current permit is a short term one with 7 years remaining with the intent of building a new Penn Station and forcing MSG elsewhere when the permit expires . <p> I say get Metro-North trains into Penn and start building the damn Hudson tunnels first before building a new Penn Station . 57712 @qwx917712 <p> Posted 28 April 2016 - 10:41 AM <p> Tear up the current building and Madison Square Garden ! MSG is hindering the growth of Penn Station . The station is hard to navigate . The ceilings are low and depressing . There are fast food restaurants in the station , and half of the place is used for AMTRAK offices , and if they were moved , then there would be better passenger circulation . I am not saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should have a great station for a great city that looks nice and is functional . While you are at it , also fix up the platforms below . Tear up some of the tracks , and make the platforms wider . <p> It 's not so much that MSG is in the way , but rather the way the Garden was built . It 's the three Ds of a dump - dark , dank and decrepit . When the current Penn Station was built , it was done so as an afterthought to the Garden , which is why the place is the way it is . This study is interesting not in the fact that we 'll never see old Pennsy again , but rather that the efforts we 're making to improve Penn Station are nowhere near enough . As mentioned above , the ever popular option of converting the Farley Post Office into the new Empire/Monyihan Station , which will cost at least $3 billion , only improves Amtrak access . It does little to improve things for the LIRR and potentially Metro-North besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that section any less of a Filene 's Basement .

I checked my credit card statement and i am charged the full amount . How can i quickly get refunded to buy a new card ? I can not afford to spend another $112 on a metrocard . It is like a loss of 224 dollars <p> If you used a credit card , then the quickest way to get a refund is to report it lost or stolen and you can get a pro-rated refund in about two days or so from the without them charging you a processing fee ( after the second time , they charge a processing fee if you report the card lost or stolen ) . Even if you do n't use the card , I believe the ' s policy is to pro-rate you because they take off time ( at least one day ) depending on how quickly you report the problem to them . So for example , if your card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would already lose one day ( today ) which is ridiculous and if it 's a weekend , two days usually , as the Metocard hotline is usually closed after a certain time on weekends ( and I believe totally closed on Sundays ) , so in your case , you may have already lost two days if you refilled on Saturday and could n't report it in time . <p> I do n't know who your credit card holder is , but I do know that the best in the business in dealing with Metrocard problems is American Express .

If you make a big enough stink they may offer a one-time credit depending on your standing with them . I would NOT however go through the unless you have to because a standard refund due to a malfunctioned Unlimited Metrocard can take MONTHS . Meanwhile they have your money and are making interest on it until they refund it to you , which I do n't most people think about , but that 's the case which further irks me . Take $112.00 or whatever the amount is , the interest made on that and then multiply by the thousands of people with malfunctioned Metrocards . They must make a nice penny from that alone , not to mention the money that they get from people with unusable amounts left on their Metrocards that they ca n't get to . <p> The only cards that they refund right away are Pay-Per-Rides because they claim that there is nothing for them to review . They see the amount on the card and just refund that or put it on another card , whereas with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the card , and figure out how to pro-rate it , which may mean giving you " X " amount of time on your card , and also giving you several small checks , which you then have to deposit into your checking account to make up the difference . The one thing to note though is that the hates when you are successful in getting your money back from malfunctioned Metrocards by disputing the charge with your credit card company . They will sometimes block your credit card from making further Metrocard purchases and in those cases , I would just request a new credit card if that happens , which as you can know you can get overnighted for free with companies like Amex and the like depending on your standing with them .

You do have to deal with Amtrak 's dispatching on the Bronx section of the corridor , plus Harold Interlocking in Queens and track space going into and out of Penn Station . <p> As long as there is no physical impediment to a subway extension , we 'll let the politicians work on the legal stuff .

If you miss just one signal there could be huge consequences ranging from a minimum of being out of service for a month to criminal charges for the people you kill . Additionally the FRA could impose fines for violations to the company and the individual if it 's a willful violation.

I have been driving a NYC Yellow Cab for the past 6 years and also have completed my Masters degree in a Health/fitness related field .

Thank you all in advance for any help or input . <p> Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the exam for the title when it becomes available . The only problem is the last exam to be offered in 2009 was the last open competitive exam for the title , meaning every T/O exam being offered in the future will be strictly promotional . In the mean time you should try other open competitive exams to get your foot in the door . You can see what exams are available on this website http : //www.mtabsc.info/ , and a useful place for study materials would be " the civil service book store " in lower manhattan . I hope this information was useful to you and good luck <p> But remember that d.c.a.s is n't going to be handling MTA exams anymore , TA is transitioning everything over to themselves . With exams and everything else employee related transitioning over to the BSC it basically confirms this .

And also just because you apply does n't mean they 'll call you in to take the exam even if you meet the minimum requirements . So do n't put your eggs all in one basket with them . Apply for as many exams as you qualify for and look into other MTA subsidiaries as well . MNRR is almost a mirror of LIRR and then there 's always NYCTA which is a civil service job and easier to get into than either of the rail roads . 
@@101482424 @5682424/ <h> Questions about Station Agent position &amp; the MTA <p> I actually got called for SA AFC after having taken the exam in June 2008 .

The mta can not have unmanned booths Cameras serve their purpose but that can not replace a human presence .

If you have a pension under NYCERS you can carry that time over to TA . So that makes you even safer if they ever did layoffs again because whatever time you had at HHC would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less seniority than me but prior civil service time at Traffic or school safety or whatever did n't get laid off if they had five or more years previous civil service time or a combined time of five years at TA and their previous civil service job . That time also helps you when it comes time to retire under TA 's 25/55 pension plan . And if you were already under a tier 4 pension plan at HHC , you do n't have to be worried about being shafted by that tier 6 bull shit either . Even under the new tier 6 pension TWU local 100 retained a 25/55 retirement plan for its members , the only local statewide to pull that off .

On those stops the conductor does not have to open all doors , but only enough to receive or discharge passengers depending on the kind of stop . <p> One more thing : If you take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bypasses the southern Bronx ( like the 6:39AM train from Crestwood ) to Grand Central , you 'll only get charged the Northern Bronx-Grand Central fare , correct ? <p> All stops in the Bronx on the Harlem and Hudson line are in fare zone 2 .

@@101482428 @5682428/ <h> My first time using LIRR and commuter rail as a whole : what to expect ? <p> With spring 2012 over , I plan to finally ride the LIRR . I have never used it previously , or any other rail network except NYCT . I want to got to Montauk , so my questions are how to do it without getting lost or missing a connection . Where and how should I get tickets ? They will be checked on board by conductor , right ? Schedules at MTA website indicate that there will be transfers , how exactly this is done ? It says that train will leave at certain time , can schedules be trusted or should I come earlier ? I understand that those questions maybe silly , any help will be much appreciated . <p> You can buy tickets to Montauk at every station that has a ticket booth or vending machine . So yes , Penn and Atlantic are 2 of your options . The LIRR usually does n't make a fuss about photographing/filming , but should someone from the LIRR or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait till it 's safe again . <p> So changing trains is something like , let 's say changing from to at Stillwell , right ? Ok , I think I 'm ready for this , now if only weather could cooperate <p> More like changing from say the to the at Sheapshead Bay or the to the at Jay St. 90% of the time the trains at Jamaica are same platforms . The only reason there is not a 1-seat ride between Montauk and Penn Station-NY is that the Montauk line uses diesel trains . While the East River tunnels between Penn Station and Queens are only equipped for electric trains . <p> How is the ( montauk ) route overall , scenic or not so ? Since its diesel there will be no see through ( RFW ) windows in front or back of the train right ? Are there are any other " must see " destinations accessible by MNRR or LIRR ?

Not to say that they wo n't call you should they like what they see . Just do n't expect a call , letter , email or any other notification if your application ends up in the circular file . Do n't let this discourage you . Persistence sometimes pays off . Just keep applying and re applying and one day you may get favorable results . <p> As far as your CDL do n't even worry about the road test until you pass the written . It 's not that it 's any easier or harder .

If you 're applying for Amtrak or freight rail in the NYC-Metro region , they wo n't even consider you . Good luck w/ MNR and LIRR . It 's hard enough for residents in their operating area to get hired , what makes you think they 'll hire someone from outside NY ? Your location states you 're from Miami ; your best bet is to apply with a transportation agency near there . <p> Not only that , but you must have the required work experience . Amtrak &amp; commuter railroads require prospective conductors to have cash-handling experience , i.e. working as a cashier at a department store or supermarket . Freight conductors usually need to have some physical labor experience . So if you 're just applying blindly , it 's just not going to work out in your favor .

@@101482435 @5682435/ <p> Ok lol those buses are from 1973 to the early 90 's and they had no AC instead they have fans . The proper way to keep your bus warm or cool is set the weather before you place a bus . I use real weather so I go to the drop down select EDDT which is real weather for Berlin since many maps are in a Berlin setting.So once you place your bus the bus temperature will be the outside temperature . <p> Once you turn that engine on your bus will heat normally depending the temp outside.If the temperature outside is between 17 and 25 degrees Celsius then that 's a comfortable temperature . Anything above 25 can be too warm and below 15 degrees can be too cold . <p> Ways to cool the bus down is opening ALL windows and adjusting the fan if that does n't work drive with the front door open that 'll cool the bus by about 1 degree every 1- seconds depending how fast your going . <p> Ways to heat the bus close all windows and put the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan on high and that 's it !

@@101482438 @5682438/ <h> Bus Operator Exam 2613 Questions <p> I have some questions regarding the upcoming Bus Operator exam 2613 . I really would love to be a buss operator for the MTA but my problem is this , I just got my class D drivers licence on January 30 , 2012 . I know that one of the requirements to get hired is to have a licence for 3 years prior to the date of hire . So if I am to take the exam , can i wait til after the 3 years to start my processing , or will I be disqualified since I just got my licence ? I know the test lasts for 4 years so , I really do n't want to wait 4 years to take the next test , then wait again to get processed . <p> One other question , can any one recommend any study materials to help prepare for the exam . From what I have heard , its very competitive so I should start studying soon . Thanks everyone for their info and love you all . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 years of driving . What you can do is not accept the appointment offer when your number is called . This can only happen 3 times , then you are removed for good from the list . Personal what i would do is pass on the offerwhen they call , then when ready reinstate yourself on the list when you have the required driving time . This will also give you time to get your CDL permit and if possible your actual CDL . There are study guides which you can get at Barnes and Noble or any other book retailer . <p> Thanks for the info Noflexdont . I think I would do just that . If they call my number , i 'll pass and reinstate my name after i meet the requirements . Now I have another question , If I reinstate my name at a later time , will they call me before people with higher list numbers , or will I be the last to be called ? <p> Do n't stress it , I was in the same situation when I took the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to figure that they are n't going to call right away not to mention it takes about a year anyway to establish the list and then figure another 2 years till they reach your list number . <p> That correct They will call in the order of list numbers . so let 's say your number is 100 but decline the job , 3 years from now there are up to list number 999 . They will call 100 first ( as long as you reinstate your number ) then 999 . It does take some time to be called for hiring process . Start studying now for the exam , drive safely , keep your nose clean and no drinking and driving . <p> Study the NYS CDL Manual . You can pick up a copy for free at your local DMV office , or you can go to your library . It 's going to be interesting to see what changes if any from the previous TA exam(8006) since the MTA now administers exams . They might raise the bar regarding education and or work experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nephew in , been looking on line for the qualifications and ca n't seem to find any . Other than the 3 years driving experience what other requirements are there to take teast , and to get appointed ? <p> This was from the last exam in 2008 , now since the MTA handles the exams there might be some changes . But I just wanted to give you an idea , we will find out next week ( June 6th ) when they post the notice .

" Go 2 Xfer OK " ? <p> Hmmm , this is kinda complicated , I will do my best to explain this though . <p> This " double-transfer " system from Staten Island to Manhattan only works for some bus routes and at some subway stations .

But this just makes me more curious . If a person transfers from a SI bus ( Sxx ) to the SIR , then he gets one free transfer at the exit turnstiles at St George terminal of the SIR and another in Manhattan at the stations and buses you mentioned , why bother trying to evade the SIR exit " fare " ? Even if you live near an SIR stop and get on the train directly , I 'd think you 'd pay the exit fare because you are getting a transfer in Manhattan in the usual manner anyway . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking distance of South Ferry terminal that you might want to avoid spending on transit altogether ( by evading the SIR fare , riding the free ferry and walking to your destination in Manhattan ) . It is highly unlikely that the majority of Staten Islanders work in a half-mile radius from South Ferry . <p> If you are going to pay for a bus in Staten Island , and you know you can get two free transfers ( to the SIR and to a bus/subway in Manhattan ) , then why bother getting off at Tompkinsville and walking to the ferry to " avoid " a fare ? Similarly why bother trying to get around paying the SIR fare at St George by walking to a nearby station that has no turnstiles ? Why not take advantage of all the transfers the MTA offers you ? <p> Is n't this precisely why the SIR 's farebox recovery is very low ? If you allow multiple free transfers and let people use the buses in SI , the buses/trains in Manhattan and the SIR all for one fare , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rider is making bus to bus/subway transfers as usual . How will adding turnstiles simply to record free transfers help fund the SIR when that $2.25 is being spread over three modes of transit ? <p> Lastly , why would Staten Islanders cry over paying an extra 50 cents round trip to use the ferry ? The ferry could use some funding too . It seems unfair that elsewhere in the city passengers pay up to 83% of the cost of a subway ride from fares ( according to Straphangers ' Campaign ) while Staten Islanders ride a ferry for free , contribute less than 10% of the cost of riding the SIR and spread their fares over buses in SI and transit in Manhattan . <p> If you ask me , I think that the best thing the MTA should do to collect lost revenue would be to install a proof of payment system for the SIR . I 've always scratched my head since I started exploring Staten Island by myself in 2007 and wondered why they can basically travel from station to station for free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best thing the MTA should do to collect lost revenue would be to install a proof of payment system for the SIR . I 've always scratched my head since I started exploring Staten Island by myself in 2007 and wondered why they can basically travel from station to station for free . <p> Yeah , but how many people really use the SIR for intra-Staten Island trips ? Most people in SI use private automobiles and/or buses . The SIR is fairly empty at most times except rush hours . Most rush hour passengers take the railroad to and from the ferry terminal . If one transfer was abolished , Staten Islanders would have to pay two fares ( one in Staten Island for the bus/rail/both , and one in Manhattan ) and the extra revenue could be directed towards SIR operations and capital projects .

How are these extra transfers " stored " on the card ? <p> You 're making this all seem a little more confusing than it actually is . If you 're using a specific commute that allows the 2nd transfer , then you do n't have to worry about nothing .

Yes , there are some that are actually evading the fare but those people are few and far between .

I think they do . <p> Not exactly , you have two hours to make the first transfer and then another two hours to make the second transfer .

BM3 is really convinient for me ( stop is literally outside my apt. building on Emmons ) , but here are my concerns : <p> 1 ) How reliable is the service on BM3 generally ? Schedule says its about 1 hour ride from Emmons Ave/Shore Blvd to State St/Battery Pl . Is that reasonable ? What has been your experience ? I realize buses can sometimes get stuck in traffic , but what would you say is the ball-park average travel time on weekdays ? <p> 2 ) How crowded does the bus usually get ? I plan on taking the BM3 at 6:30AM ( arriving downtown Manhattan at 7:28AM ) . Since the next bus only leaves at 7AM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me since I 'd be late for work . Is it ever the case that bus could be so full that I wo n't be able to get on ? I ask this because I actually wo n't be getting on at beginning of the route at Emmons/Shore Blvd , but a little further down at Emmons/Knapp St. <p> I would like to find out all of this info by myself , but I have n't even moved into my apartment yet . I 'd love to hear any input from people who are more familiar with this route , so I at least know what to expect . <p> Well I use the BM3 usually on Saturdays , but sometimes during the week as well . The Downtown Loop bus which I would imagine you 'll be taking gets decent usage . The traffic lights in Brooklyn can be a PITA especially along Ocean and by Cortelyou Rd and such . They are n't sinked properly and can slow down the commute quite a bit . On Saturdays I find the BM3s to run not so great of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sometimes I question if they 're coming or not . With that said , I would still go with the BM3 over schlepping on the local bus to the subway . You have a one seat ride and the comfort over the subway . During the week though , they 're pretty prompt and they do get good usage . I usually use the Midtown Super Express BM3s but the Downtown Loop BM3s run pretty frequent and are decently used too . <p> As for traffic in Manhattan if you 're not doing the Loop or do n't have to do it , I would recommend getting off by the first stop which seems like you 'll be doing that anyway because the traffic by Trinity can be a mess with all of the express buses and construction and such . In sum , yeah an hour should be about right in case there is traffic , etc . <p> And just so you know , the fare is $5.50 on the BM3 , rather than $2.25 for the local bus + subway commute . Transfers between the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably already know this , but I 'm just throwing it out there in case you 're new to NYC or something ) <p> If you 're taking the BM3 daily , I 'd recommend the weekly Express Bus Plus MetroCard for $50 . It 's valid on all express buses ( any route with an " X " , " BM " , " QM " , or " BxM " in front of it ) as well as the subway and local bus . At $50 per week , you 're already ahead compared to paying for each individual ride , so any additional express bus ( or even local bus/subway ) rides you take in addition to your regular commute are essentially free . <p> As far as whether it 's worth the extra fare , you have to decide that for yourself . As VG8 said , you have the advantage of a guaranteed seat ( there should be plenty because it 's still near the beginning of the route ) and you can doze off because you do n't have to make a transfer during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to transfer to the at DeKalb Avenue to reach Lower Manhattan , or the at Atlantic Avenue if those are more convenient to your job ) <p> The disadvantage of course , is the extra fare and the fact that the BM3 runs infrequently ( like you said , you only have one bus that can get you to work on time ) . As VG8 said , do n't sit throuugh the whole loop if you do n't have to . If your job is by State Street/Water Street , I 'd recommend getting off at Battery Place/West Street ( I think all rush hour buses serve that stop . I think it 's only the off-peak buses that go directly onto Trinity Place , based on riding the express routes out in SI ) <p> And also throwing it out there , but a monthly pass for the subway/local bus ( not valid on the express bus ) is $104 , so you break even after 50 rides . A weekly pass is $29 ( you break even after 14 rides ) . <p> Welcome to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Sheepshead Bay growing up as a kid .

What has been your experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what would you say is the ball-park average travel time on weekdays ? <p> To answer your question , the bus is at the mercy of traffic along the Gownaus/BQE ( Interstate 278 ) and the Battery Tunnel . On Saturdays and late weekday evenings yes , it is usually about 50-60 minutes between Emmons and Lower Manhattan . During Rush Hours it 's best to add about 10-20 minutes extra time to the trip .

@@101482450 @5682450/ <h> Can anybody tell me how the zone system works ? <p> I take the Hudson Bergen Light Rail all the time , but I never took the bus before . I 'm trying to get to Edgewater , and normally I drive my car , but the parking lot is so packed all the time to the place I go that I figured it would probably be easier taking transit to get there . So my dilemma is , I know to take Lightrail to Port Imperial , then switch to the NJ transit #158 , but how does the fare system work ? I was reading online about zones and transfers from light rail to bus , but how does it work ? <p> I have to pass through two zones , and I was reading about the transfer from train to bus but it says its only valid for one zone , so how would I get a transfer for a two zone bus ride ? <p> And lastly , how does the bus driver know how many zones you are going through ? Does it work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can keep track of the zones you pass through ? <p> Sorry i 'm all new to this ' zoning ' idea so I have no idea what exactly to do . <p> Hi Livingston , You tell the B/O on a NJ Transit bus your destination and he/she will calculate how many zones for your fare . For example : You board a #81 bus at Ocean Avenue and Union Street in Jersey City and tell the B/O you 're going to Avenue C and West 50th Street in Bayonne . He or she will calculate the two zone fare from Jersey City to Bayonne . Do n't forget to take your receipt for your ride . <p> I ran a test trip from Jersey City to Edgewater using HBLR and the #158 and NJ Transit 's trip planner came back with $0 for rail and $2.95 for bus plus 70 cents for the transfer fee , so apparently one way fare from Exchange Place HBLR to Edgewater is $3.65 . <p> AFAIKO , There is n't a " two zone " transfer .

Can take the Q10 from Lefferts Blvd on the line or from Kew Gardens/Union TPK on the and line . 2 . Take the Q10 to the last stop which is Terminal 4 and then find your way to AirTrain. 3 . Then you can ride the entire AirTrain for free ! Just do n't get off at Jamaica or Howard Beach cause then you have to pay the $5 fare for it . <p> Oh , and becareful with taking pictures and videos cause PANYNJ does n't allow that .

I 'll be shocked if the PANYNJ have n't figured that out yet .

A 1620 key will also do the same and put it into fire service ( a elevator . ) On another note , a 1620 key will fit into a 2642 cylinder but a 2642 key will not fit in a 1620 cylinder , trust me I have tried . <p> what is the difference between the FDNY 1620 Key and the 2642 key ? Is the 2642 for putting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confusion and misunderstanding surrounding these keys , so I 'll give you the full breakdown here . NOTE - while there have been some news outlets that have irresponsibly written all kinds of " sky is falling " stories about these keys ( particularly when a lock collector and retired locksmith Daniel Ferraris was selling some on eBay ) but most of that was just yellow journalism nonsense . These keys are VERY widespread and while some parties would like them to be more restricted , the cat is WAY out of the bag and has been for decades . <p> The 2642 key is the official Fire Service key for NYC elevators . That means that it should operate in both the ground floor ( or designated recall floor ) hall station Fire Service Phase One key switch and it should also operate on elevator car operating panel Fire Service Phase Two key switches . For more on what Fire Service operation is and how it works , use Google . <p> The 2642 key is cut on a Yale Y1 blank and has a bitting of ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " general purpose " key for NYC fire personnel and first responders . Sometimes it 's been called the " Fireman 's Key " but this naturally has a lot of term confusion with the former key discussed above . This is the key that was being copied like MAD on the black market because it allows easy opening of emergency exit gates on the MTA and such ( or , rather , it used to ... that 's been changed out most everywhere now ) and it was used by fare evaders for that reason . This key also used to open things like Fire House front doors and some kinds of key boxes found on construction job sites and other places where fire inspections and oversight were needed . <p> The 1620 key is cut on a Yale Y1 blank and has a bitting of 6-6-4-2-0 <p> The 2642 key is still the official Elevator Fire Service key for NYC . The 1620 key is rapidly becoming totally deprecated . <p> The 2642 is used by building superintendents to stop from going to specific elevator or to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the same and put it into fire service ( a elevator . ) On another note , a 1620 key will fit into a 2642 cylinder but a 2642 key will not fit in a 1620 cylinder , trust me I have tried . <p> So , there is some reason for a lot of confusion here . And it has to do with how certain key switches and locks were manufactured and pinned . <p> As you can see above , both of these keys have a 0-bitted value in the final pinning position ( out by the tip of the key ) . The truth is , on most installations , locks or key switches would normally not even HAVE any pin or wafer in that final position . Effectively , the locks were just 4-pin bitted . <p> There are even SOME locks ( exclusively elevator key switches , in my experience ) where the FIRST position is not populated , either . These are for elevator panels where the manufacturer wants the keyswitch to be operable by both a 2642 key ( the official NYC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general purpose " Fireman 's Key ) <p> Given that the 1620 has fallen out of general use , those kinds of key switches are less necessary these days , but you still see them often . <p> Another interesting note : it is possible to find locks and ( especially ) key switches for these systems that are WAFER locks as opposed to conventional pin-tumbler locks . Even though Yale keys are almost synonymous with pin tumbler mechanisms , there are some parts makers in the elevator world who produce wafer-based key switches in the Y8 keyway and bitted up as X-6-4-2-X ( with blanks in the front and rear position , so as to accept either key ) <p> Melvin may have been confused when he said " a 1620 key will fit into a 2642 cylinder but not vice versa " ... given that both keys are based around the Y1 blank and thus both keys have the common " Yale 8 " keyway ... the KEYS themselves will fit in either kind of lock without any difficulty at all . What Melvin may have meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1620 lock ( as in , it wo n't allow the cylinder to turn ) <p> 2642 key in a lock designed for 1620 key = non-operation is not a shock <p> 1620 key in an elevator keyswitch for 2642 key = will operate a LOT of the time <p> Again , all of this is pretty common knowledge in the industry and also appears in code documents , etc ... so I 'm not really letting the cat out of the bag here . The cat is long gone decades ago ... and has found a mate , raised a family , and opened a falafel stand by now . <p> The difference is that you do n't need either . Possesion of those keys constitutes possesion of bugluary tools . <p> INDman espouses a very typical but also very wrong view here . Much respect to you , sir , but that 's not what the law says . NYC , like many jurisdictions , considers possession of anything that can get you somewhere that you do n't belong to be " possession of burglary tools " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for a nefarious purpose . ( trespassing or other criminal action ) <p> Mere possession of these keys ( or of lockpicks , a crowbar , etc ) is NOT a crime in New York if there is no evidence of your intent to commit a crime . <p> New York Consolidated Laws of New York - PEN Title I - Article 140 - - 140.35 - Possession of burglar 's tools . A person is guilty of possession of burglar 's tools when he possesses any tool , instrument or other article adapted , designed or commonly used for committing or facilitating offenses involving forcible entry into premises , or offenses involving larceny by a physical taking , or offenses involving theft of services , under circumstances evincing an intent to use or knowledge that some person intends to use the same in the commission of an offense of such character . <p> I hope that helps ! Naturally , as innocuous as much of this knowledge is , it is extremely unwise to attempt to use either the 2642 key or the 1620 key in any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . It goes without saying : do n't mess with elevators , pay for your subway rides , and just generally do n't be a jackwagon.

I have looked everywhere and there seems to be a lot of confusion . Disclaimer : what I am posting is not fact , all it is is my understanding from what I have researched here and other forums . I have read other answers that are similar except without a reasonable explanation . So if anybody wants to revise my explanation , please do . Ok here goes . Your list# is your list # and that is what determines when you will receive a letter to start per-employment ( no duh . I know I know ) . Whether or not you are on out . cert . list has nothing to do with when you will be called . " Outstanding " means unresolved . Like an outstanding warrant or outstanding ticket . For example in my case I was on an out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veterans status which gave me a certain number of points which determined what was my place on the established list . Now once I verified my veterans status I was no longer on the out . cert . list because my place on the list was resolved . No longer outstanding . When I call dcas I now get " you are not currently on an outstanding certification " . It 's possible that two eligible candidates close in number be called for preemployment off the list with one being on out . cert . and another not being on out . cert . I can understand the confusion . How some people believe it means you are close or how it does n't mean anything . The important thing is that you are a reasonable list # . Well I hope if anything this opens up discussion to what this all means and hopefully we get more clarification . Gluck to everyone

Where Transit is a Civil Service job for the city and both Rail Roads fall under state workers even though we do serve the public as well.LIRR and MNRR are really RR companies that fall under the MTA umbrella.Just like CSX and Amtrak and any other RR out there other then the fact instead of freight they move commuters.Every document and pay stub has the word Company behind Long Island Rail Road.So both RR are allowed to pick and choose who they want to hire.As you know there is no test for CAM 's but any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to take a test . Just as someone else bought out , be patient and stop worrying over it.Believe me you made it further then boat load of other people.Just go on in life just as it is n't there.Once it comes everything will go by swiftly .

After riding LIRR for well over a decade , I finally seem to realize there is an extra charge for step up fare .... as in off peak ticket to peak ticket on board charge . <p> So if off peak one way from zone 1 to zone 4 is $8 or ten trip ticket ( $68/$6.80 per ride ) , I would be charged $5 cash from the conductor if I was on the peak train . That would be a total of $12 or $12.80 . Oppose to buying a one way ticket which cost $11 . So there is $1 or $1.80 charge ? <p> bottom line , if that is correct , then I am better off having a peak ticket or a 10 trip peak ticket . <p> The price of the step up for an off-peak one-way or round trip direct ticket is the difference between off-peak and peak fares , rounded up to the nearest dollar . <p> The price of the step up for an off peak ten trip is the difference between 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way peak fare , rounded up to the nearest dollar . ( because off peak ten trips are discounted ) <p> The price of an extension of ride for a weekly or monthly ticket is the price of a one way ( peak/off peak ) ticket between the ticketed zone and the desired zone , rounded up to the nearest dollar . <p> The price of an extension of ride for a one way or round trip ticket is the difference between the desired ticket price and the one you have , rounded up to the nearest dollar . <p> I think if both transactions are involved , the rounding is done once at the end . ( not 100% on this one ) Also not sure on extending an off peak 10 trip . <p> Before 12/30/2010 there was no rounding and the total price of a stepped up off peak ticket would be the same as if you bought a peak ticket to begin with . Not anymore . <p> Basically , it 's best if you have the correct ticket for the type of ride you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up paying more for the same ride . <p> Amtrak7 is right on pretty much everything . <p> Here is some clarification on the 10 trip step up + extension . <p> Say you have a Zone 1 to 4 off peak 10 trip and you want to use it to zone 7 on a peak train . <p> You are charged the $5 10 trip step up to turn your ticket into a one way peak zone 1 to 4 ticket ( $11 ) . Then we add the difference between a zone 1 to 4 peak and a zone 1 to 7 peak ( $12.50 - $11 ) which is $1.50 , for a total of $6.50 . Then it is rounded up to the nearest dollar . So you 'd be charged $7 for this example . <p> Let me know if you have any other ticket questions . <p> They started this rounding up practice to reduce the amount of quarters that we need to carry on us , but it 's moot since we still need to have them for seniors . Seniors are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Amtrak7 is right except it 's a 15% discount with the off peak ten trip over the cost of 15 one way off peaks . <p> Stepping it up to the peak fare you lose the discount per ride . <p> The one way peak is $11 . One way off peak to peak step up is $3 . The step up for the 10 trip off peak should be $11 minus the $6.80 = $4.20 rounded up to the next dollar amount = $5.00 <p> In essence you would be better buying a one way peak as there is an 80 cents savings . <p> Not to go off topic but if you try to refund the unused portion of an off peak ten trip you also lose the discount . Example if you turn in a 10 trip with 8 rides used they deduct $8 for each ride used equaling $64 making the refund $4 . Add the processing fee ( $10 ) you would get nothing back . <p> Anyone who pays the on board price is just not very smart . Just get the tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even know what the on board price is for MNRR because I get my tickets in advance . They 're pricey enough as it is . No need to give the more of your hard earned money and if you are n't sure , just get the peak ticket . That 's what I do . I get off-peak only when I 'm sure I 'll be riding off peak . <p> The onboard penalty is $6 , rounded to the nearest dollar . ( note : round , not necessarily round up ) <p> It is quite effective , I do n't see that many people buying full fare tickets on trains anymore . But I seem to be seeing more step-ups , including the oft-overlooked and annoying senior to AM peak step up ( does this one round ? ) <p> I believe zone extension is a full fare ... just no on board fare . If so , I think that would be the biggest rip ever . I could be wrong but I read it somewhere here a while back <p> See my first post for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip , full fare for commutation tickets . <p> Anyone who pays the on board price is just not very smart .

No need to give the more of your hard earned money and if you are n't sure , just get the peak ticket . That 's what I do . I get off-peak only when I 'm sure I 'll be riding off peak . <p> There are many people that pay the on board for any reason imaginable . The reasons range from the legitimate lost ticket to ticket machine on the platform not working ( even though the other 50 that got on the train with him had no problem ) . <p> Then there 's those that do n't expect the 7:21 train to leave at 7:21 . Some one will run up to me at 7:20 and ask if I can wait while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I politely tell them I have to check with the few hundred people already on the train with their tickets . <p> The onboard penalty is $6 , rounded to the nearest dollar .

I was n't sure from memory as I only occasionally work in the morning .

I mean ... in tandem with another card or change ? " <p> Would it deduct everything , and then say " Add additional fare " and then the required amount ? <p> If it 's #3 , then the problem is if I do n't know the exact card value beforehand and I dip it , and it 's not enough , I would n't know how much to add . I do n't even know if it would allow the additional fare to be paid off a second card , or just change alone . Does the driver see the amount deducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing .... does a transfer count anything ( partial value ) towards an express bus taken after a regular route bus or subway ? If not ( which I assume ) is it consumed by the express bus ride anyhow ( not fair ) , or preserved for the next regular ride ? ( probably pushing my luck there , but it 's only fair ) <p> Transfers from local routes to express routes deduct 3 dollars from the card . If you transfer from an express route to local route , or even to another express route ( I 've transferred from the BM5 to the BM1 this way ) , it deducts nothing more . I 'm not sure about your choices . <p> So , just to be clear .... the transfer from a regular route/subway counts as $2 off ? What happens if you have less than $3 left ? Can you use coins to make up the difference ? <p> Also , while I doubt this ( since an express bus metrocard still exists ) , if you have a standard unlimited ride card , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( With additional payment , of course ) <p> I remember one time I guided my Japanese elderly tourists friend via Airtrain JFK , then to Rockaway Blvd.When we got on QM15 , one passenger tries to get to Manhattan , but when she swipe her Unlimited MetroCard was INVALID because her Unlimited Pass not for express bus . <p> You can indeed use your MetroCard even if it has less than the required fare on it . <p> Say you 're getting ready to ride the express bus , but your card only has $3.75 on it . What will happen is that you will dip your card , it will come back with a low sounding beep on it and it will say : $3.75 PAID ... $1.25 MORE <p> Then you can simply pay the $1.25 in change to fully pay the fare . Make sure you 've got the $1.25 to continue because once you dip your card , you 're out the $3.75 and there are no refunds . The same premise applies with local buses too . One drawback with the combination MC/Cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another scenario : you have $4 on your MetroCard and want to do a local to express transfer . You pay the $2 on the local bus , then on boarding the express bus it will accept the local transfer for $2 off , it will deduct the remaining $2 from the card , then you 'll have to pay $1 additional in coins . <p> In this case , you 'll keep your MC transfer because you had the proper fare on the card when you first boarded the local bus . <p> If you were doing say a local to local bus ride , and you only had $1.50 on your card , then you would dip your MC , it will say that you owe 50- , you pay the 50- , then you 'll have to ask for a paper transfer to complete your trip .

If this had been done in accordance with the United States Constitution , then we could have debated what had to be done and should have been done to implement it if it was passed by the United States Senate . At that time we would have discussed as to the impact upon industry , upon workers , what had to be done to retrain the workers and to allocate the funds necessary for implementation . What happened was the opposite of what should have been done as the former president and the administrative state decided to implement this deal which many Americans objected to as they feel it interferes with our nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may determine hurt our nation and our economy .

In addition to what you said I think there are some good bus operators that get discouraged due to their interaction with nasty members of the public . <p> That 's a good question . I honestly do n't see the making any changes to such ways of doing business until their attitude changes about their bottom line .

Granted , I do n't want some nut job driving recklessly , but at the same time , having guys crawl from stop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how half of these guys even want to come to work having to go through what they do these days , and that actually may be why some trips go unfilled . I know of quite a few drivers that simply refuse to do any overtime because they do n't think they should do anything extra since management has become so difficult . On top of that , you have some trips taking two plus hours one way , because congestion is so bad that these guys can take 20 minutes just to go a few blocks ( and I do mean a few blocks ) , so by the time they actually finish with their regular schedule , they may be exhausted . <p> The needs to be more vocal about the need for buses to be the priority in the city , and so that means perhaps Cuomo and de Blasio getting together to see how traffic can be improved , which given their " courteous " behavior towards one another seems highly unlikely , so there 's actually a ton of reasons why bus service has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we see any significant progress if the is actually serious about this .

If we continue to see a trend where people are hopping in cabs and using all of these car sharing apps , it may become even worse . <p> Moerdler also talked about having traffic cops be more active . Double and triple parking is a MAJOR problem across the city , especially those Fresh Direct , UPS and FedEx trucks . <p> I have nothing against better enforcement when the goal is actually to move traffic and not just to raise revenue . <p> I was driving on Ocean Parkway about six months ago cruising along with everyone else at a safe 30 mph when all of a sudden everything slowed to 20 mph for two long blocks .

They take up all of the parking spaces from anyone else who may need to park . Something needs to be done about that too because it leads to even more trucks double or triple parking , so then you have a street that should have maybe three lanes that now becomes a single lane with everyone having to weave back and forth to get around the double parked trucks . What I find funny is the truck drivers themselves claim that their companies are losing business too because of how bad the congestion is becoming . Apparently it is n't too bad because they continue to do it . I said this before , but more deliveries need to be set up at night . I see plenty of places around Manhattan that have such a set up . Delivery guy comes , unlocks the front door , delivers what is needed and closes up and goes on about his business .

With the growth in weekday ridership and steady weekend ridership during the pilot period , and customer requests that NYCT has received to reinstate weekend service , X28 weekend service is being proposed for reinstatement on a permanent basis . <p> The X28 will permanently operate on Saturdays and Sundays between W 37 St/Surf Av in Coney Island and E 57 St/Madison Av in Midtown Manhattan . <p> Hours of service will remain as follows : <p> Saturdays <p> From Coney Island to Midtown Manhattan : 6 a.m. " 8:15 p.m . <p> From Midtown Manhattan to Coney Island : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coney Island to Midtown Manhattan : 7 a.m. " 7:15 p.m . <p> From Midtown Manhattan to Coney Island : 8:30 a.m. " 9 p.m . <p> Wait so Coney Island is going to get weekend service , but no weekday service ( Outside of Rush ) ? <p> Wait so Coney Island is going to get weekend service , but no weekday service ( Outside of Rush ) ? <p> It 's always been that way , and that service is really for Sea Gate , not Coney Island . During the week , most trips start and end in Bensonhurst . Most of the usage comes from upscale Dyker Heights and the Bay Ridge border anyway . <p> I sent in an email suggesting that they combine the X27/28 in Brooklyn , then go to the city . <p> How in the world are you going to do that ? ! <p> 0 57704 @qwx917704 57706 @qwx917706 57703 @qwx917703 <p> It 's always been that way , and that service is really for Sea Gate , not Coney Island . During the week , most trips start and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upscale Dyker Heights and the Bay Ridge border anyway . <p> It would be a waste . Sea Gate is n't that big to begin with and aside from that , you do n't have that many people using the express bus down there ( be it Sea Gate or Coney Island ) . It makes no sense to extend all trips during the week with so few people using it . On weekends it 's quick , plus you can market the bus to folks going to baseball games or Coney Island . <p> Presumably via X28 from Sea Gate to 86th &amp; 7th , then via 86th Street and 5th/4th Avenues to Shore Road , then cover the full X27 route . <p> Yes , that was my idea exactly . I do n't believe there is ridership demand for the routes separately , so why not combine them and save resources . <p> Someone suggested this stupid idea before and its pointless to combine both routes . No one is going to sit on an express bus that long taking a tour of just about all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different neighborhoods ( Sea Gate , Coney Island , Bensonhurst , Bath Beach , Dyker Heights and Bay Ridge/Fort Hamilton ) . <p> The X27 alone had almost 1,000 riders on weekends in 2015 , and the has noted how ridership has also grown on the X28 , so regard less of what people think they see , the stats say otherwise . <p> If you two are going to make such claims , how about you do your homework first ? And Gotham Bus we can pay for the X28 weekend service by cutting service in your neighborhood . Seems reasonable to me since you constantly advocate for such ridiculous cuts in areas you know nothing about .

I was just wondering when they asked you about your previous employment do they get in touch with your suoervisors ? some of my supervisors are no longer there . How long after do they call you if it goes well ? How long do you have to be there ? Do you just speak to one person ? Thanks I am sorry for all the questions . <p> Hey EASF : I will also be taking the exam on April 18th as well . No you do n't need to have the dot medical exam done before taking the test . You do n't need to have a CDL class B license to take the test . The permit you have is fine for now ( you do have the ' P " endorsement on it right ? ) . They ( MTA , TA , etc ) prefer if you just have the CDL Permit , so they can train you their way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a driving school on a school bus , failed the road test a couple of days ago , need more training , will take the road test again next month at a different location . I would prepare for the exam and worry about your CDL afterwards . You will have eneough time to do so . <p> Hello Locomotion , thank you for the information and clarifications. yes i have my cdl b permit with passenger endorsement . well , i hope to see you on the exam date on april . and good luck your next drive test . see you later . thank you . <p> EASF : Your in luck . I had the K endorsement on my license as well , because I was 20 when I got my cdl . I NEVER GOT IT REMOVED , AND WHEN I WENT FOR MY MEDICAL THEY DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT . They give you their own medical , so your ok with that . <p> To take the test , all you need is a regular license . To get hired , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SO let 's say they call you next march of 2009 . If you got your license in march of 2006 or before that date , then your good . The next requirment TO GET HIRED is that you must have a cdl class B permit with Passenger and air-brakes endorsements . That , you could get the day before they call you if you wanted . They do n't care . Lastly , you should have NO RESTRICTIONS . What they mean by that ; is that you should n't have gotten your license suspended for a stupid reason , and things like that . For example you just recieved your license back , coming from a suspension , and you could only drive during the day and not at night . A restriction is fine . As a matter of fact , I remember the fingerprinting lady deleting that off my record . <p> In terms of getting your cdl license , that would be a smart idea . The only time that comes into play , is after you qualify during training . Let me explain- When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter who has , and who does n't have their cdl license . Some have permits , some have licenses . Everyone gets 10 days to qualify ( to become a bus driver for the MTA ) . Once they qualify , the MTA gives those drivers the OK to drive for the MTA ; but guesss what ? The state of New York never gave you the right to drive a bus , so now you have to go take your DMV road test . So those with a cdl license that qualify by day 10 of training are free and clear . All they have to do , is just wait till graduation . Those with the cdl permit still have to wait to take their STATE road test . <p> So if your asking me for a suggestion , I would tell you this . Continue to study a drivers ed manuel . Stay calm , and do n't worry about getting your cdl until after you take test #8006 . You do n't want to overwelm yourself . Especially since you still have about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take about 10 driving lessons on a bus ( assuming you have the P and air brakes endorsements ) . <p> Lastly , do n't panic when you take the test . Your already a step ahead because you found this site . CHEATER ! ! ! ! lol Those people taking the test are expecting a dummy test like the sanitation test . Even after you check your answers , and if you get 11 wrong like I did , do n't panic . My list # was 825 . You should be very proud of yourself that you even made the initiative on your own to go ahead and file for the test . Alot of people our age are unemployed and still " waiting " for that great 100k a year job because they have a bachelors degree . More power to them , but you do n't have that .

@@101482524 @5682524/ <p> Ok ladies and gentlemen . MTA has just thrown me for a loop again . They are now considering sending Grand some D60HF 's for the shuttle work , and FP which has most of the work is severely short on buses , and apparently MTA has no idea what they are going to do about that and only have 6 days to decide . Now they are going through a last minute crisis scenario .... <p> 6103 , 6111 , and 6113 in the meanwhile are being reassigned to OH . There is no final word on what exactly will happen . At this point Grand may only get half the buses they were first planned . Now this is all as of right now . This morning at my time of posting all 3 buses were in fact assigned to Grand , after I got this emergency notice I looked into the database and not only are they now assigned to OH , but effective immediately , all 3 of them are set to now be diverted to OH today . <p> I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told it 's just beginning ... <p> I ca n't say I did n't see that coming .... <p> So how does a garage end up with a severe shortage of buses without the higher ups noticing ? <p> I 'd like to know too .

That last one is gon na be a little tough to explain . <p> MTA knows there is a fleet shortage lol . Come on now , clearly I would n't be posting what I did if they did n't know . The thing is they have a lot of alder buses that need preventive maintenance and scheduled maintenance . They also have at least 5 buses in the shop at Grand or at the vender in the shop getting warranty work done . <p> The only place the buses are needed is at OH which has a large fleet of D60 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would try to appease some customers and put new buses with WiFi and chargers on the shuttle , while others would like for them to go to Lexington Avenue and 14th street . Since Qill does n't have any Xcelsiors and hardly any , ( if any at all ) drivers or mechanics are trained on them , the only logical place is OH . <p> I mean literally moments before The Real made his post I checked the roster and noticed 3 busses assigned straight from the vendor . Then all of a sudden Monday morning MTA decides they want to change things and send them to OH . Now after looking into some things I realize that not only is the shuttle still 5 days away , so they do n't need them right now , ( at least not 3 ) . <p> Tuskegee has at least 6 artics in the shop and a few others out of service . So I made another call and even though they have a few days for the final decision , the verdict is that OH needs them now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttle still . The could be implemented after the rout starts , or the could use D60 's or a combination of both . Flatbush has work on the route with LFSA 's from what I 'm am being told at this hour .

Take the bloody train or bus to school and make sure we arrive on time ? <p> As a student from the school , I can safely calculate that 90% of the students from the school live at least 30 minutes by train or bus from the school . Out of that number , 85% live at least an hour by train or bus from the school . And from that number , 7 out of 8 come from Queens .

@@101482530 @5682530/ <p> An improperly zoned train is when the Master Door Controller is activated ( or zoned up ) in the improper car . On a 10 car train the conductor always operates from the 6th car , but if a train goes through a relay to turn around as it does at say Parkchester in the BX or Utica in BK , the 6th car , becomes the 5th car once the train is headed back the other direction and the train is now improperly zoned . If a conductor does n't  catch this and tries to zone up in the proper position while the other MDC is still zoned up , they wont be able to operate the doors in the front section and wont get indication in that section . <p> Basically there are 2 captains on the same ship so the ship is confused . Easy to correct , if you remember to check for it <p> Who are the platform conductors ?

Platform work can also be disciplinary for a conductor that messes up on the road i believe . <p> So far the only OT ive gotten has come in the form of late clears and no lunches . I had one job that paid more than 8hrs . When i call the crew office ive been getting regular jobs that pay about 8hrs .

I no longer adhere to the 2 minutes prior rule ... i 'm on my train AS SOON AS IT PULLS IN. you 're going to need all of those 5-9 minutes ( assuming you get even that much ) . There are gaps in training , or maybe i was n't paying attention , but you 'll learn : <p> 1 ) To just get on your train whether you saw your T/O get on or not <p> 2 ) Whether to shut down your train for a relay or leave it open for the next crew <p> 3 ) Improper zoning DOES indeed happen in real life .

Failing to provide Dr 's lines when required will get you marked AWOL , which means you will be OOS until you have a Labor Relations hearing . <p> You will be put on the sick control list if a. you call out more than 4 times without providing Dr 's lines in a 365 day span b. use more than 50% of your possible available sick days ( which is one reason why selling back sick days is a VERY bad idea , or c. are in the bottom 30% of sick records for employees in your title .

But seeing as its a mabstoa position , is there any issue in regards to working as a mabstoa checker , then going to conductor when getting called up ? I 've been told that you got ta go through checker , then become a cleaner , then you can go to conductor . <p> Some former Traffic Checkers that I have worked with decided to become cleaners before becoming conductors . If you become a cleaner you are eligible to take promotional exams such as conductor which many of my co-workers took advantage of it which they got hired as conductors . Since Traffic Checker is a MABSTOA title you only eligible to take promotional exams from MABSTOA . I had to take the open competitive exam for conductor since I choose not to became a cleaner . Becoming a cleaner after working at least one year as a Traffic Checker is easier way to advance yourself up the ladder in Transit .

@@101482553 @5682553/ <p> I 'm not sure why they want to create a completely new route instead of making the B38 SBS . Maybe it has to do with how the LTD and SBS is set up , but I think that it can be possible if some of the B38 is tweaked a bit with the depots it runs out of . <p> A dedicated SBS lane could work on Lafayette Ave without impinging on parking until it crosses Marcy Ave where the street narrows , all the way to Patchen Ave/Broadway . SBS on DeKalb Ave e/o Bushwick Ave ? I 'm not so sure . Very narrow two way street . DeKalb Ave w/o Bushwick ? No problem all the way down . <p> I foresee the same problem on Wilson Ave with the new SBS route ; the street is so narrow that when two B60 's traveling in opposite directions come together , one gives way to the other . Placing a dedicated lane on each side would force traffic closer to the center because the SBS lanes would be wider than the space cars use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Knickerbocker Ave could be used for the return trip . <p> Yeah cause that would n't be logical at all to use the B38 or the B54 in my opinion . I 've used both of those routes quite a few times and the traffic conditions and double parking on Myrtle especially would not make these options attractive at all . Flushing Av could be doable . B53 SBS and Super SBS as mentioned in my edited post above . <p> 0 57705 @qwx917705 <p> I 'm inclined to believe that this is some sort of compromise for the closure .... Quick link from Myrtle-Wyckoff to all the subway lines ( that the L connects to anyway , in Manhattan ) in Downtown Brooklyn .... <p> I would like for the B57 to be diverted off Flushing ( west of Tompkins/Throop ) &amp; onto Park av. anyway ....

@@101482557 @5682557/ <p> The MTA will verify your veterans credit themselves . This is just the city double checking for themselves had already started schoolcar when I recieved my notice to go down to 1 Centre St for verification last November . <p> So did a friend of mine I spoke with yesterday . He told me that once he was in schoolcar , then he recieved a notification to go to 1 centre street . However , my situation is different .. I took my drug test 12/12/12 and tomorrow will make 4 weeks .. but no call yet to report to the medical .. i 'm positive i did n't  fail my drug test because I do n't  do drugs .. so WTF is the hold up ? lol .. maybe i 'm just being impatient .. <p> I am in the 220 range . My original drug test was 10/17 and I got called in for final processing roughly 5 weeks later . I am certain that at least a couple of those weeks were a deferral on account of Sandy . Your list number is roughy 100 numbers above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 350 . My assumption is that 2 out of 5 that got the letter to come down for drug test never showed because they were no longer interested . Another 1 out of 5 showed up and for various reasons did not qualify or were deferred for medical . That leaves roughly 40 individuals that qualified between my number and your number . Actually on second thought .. My estimations are just a bit off . There have been 3 O/C classes since October . 40 students per class .. If last person hired was 350 , then that means that 1/3 or 33 percent of original eligibles were sworn in as of 12/17 . That does not account for those on medical hold and people like yourself who are awaiting clearance for military credit . I think that you are right about where you should be in the process . No ? <p> Great estimations bro .. So what your saying is that they 're basically waiting for those who are on medical hold , etc .. to clear up their situations ? Which does n't  make since cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wont be fair for those who are on hold .. <p> Hey guys , had a quick question which has been brought up b4 about taking your name off the list and having it re enstated .

For 8098 , the list is active until September 2016 . If you receive a letter in the mail to go down to 130 Livingston for pre employment then you have 2 choices . You can simply not show or mail the attached form stating that you decline or you can go down and start the process and if you are called for final processing and ultimately appointment before you are ready , then you can decline . Either way your name will be taken off of the list and will not be restored until you request to have it restored . <p> You can request to have it restored via a letter to DCAS or you can just go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in person . They will send you a letter informing you when your name has been restored and you will be placed back on the list at the same position that you were originally . Now keep in mind that there are probably quite a few people that may have declined and requested reinstatement by that time and anyone whose number was before yours will be called back first , so keep that in mind . <p> My advice would be that if you get a letter to go down in early summer , simply fill out the declination letter and send it back and then in mid summer go down to DCAS and get your name and list number restored . It took me literally 10 minutes and the letter of list renewal came about 2 weeks later . Save yourself the hassle of going down to 130 Livingston until you are ready . There is no real benefit of going down if you are not prepared to start within 2 weeks of pre employment interview ( drug test ) <p> My list number is over 500 for TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen .

@@101482559 @5682559/ <p> as it actually has details then the trains for best connections would be 7:40 am or 9:40 departures as they time best with S63 . Sadly the rest of the day S63 is COMPLETE SHIT . You will soon learn suffolk county transit is well like this is the best way to describe em <p> As a daily Montauk Branch commuter , I strongly reccomend you take the train to Patchouge . Bus travel on Long Island ( east of the City Line ) should be avoided at all costs especially if you have to transfer during your journey . <p> Some people were alluding to avoiding certain trains like locals or expresses or something like that . My only advice is to stay away from the Summer extras . If you look in the main branch timetable and the train is shaded in black , that means it only runs on Fridays or Sundays ( read the notes carefully ) and they are usually a haven for the riff-raff who are going out east for a good time . <p> All the other trains are fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The transfer is across the platform and easy . The vast majority of Montauk trains that require a transfer at Babylon will line up with two Babylon branch eletric trains " one local and one semi-express that stops only at Freeport , Jamaica , and Woodside before Penn Station , so those are perfectly good options as well . <p> 1 <p> A city is only really home when you stop being mystified by its public transport system and instead are just constantly angry at it.Sign up to receive occasional updates from The LIRR Today by e-mail at lists.thelirrtoday.com . <p> To whomever asked about college being open on weekends , just because most colleges do not have sunday classes , there are often still social events , lectures , presentations , etc. , that go on on the weekends .
