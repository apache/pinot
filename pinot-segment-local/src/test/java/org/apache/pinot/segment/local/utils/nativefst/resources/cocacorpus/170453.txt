A power surge lasts longer " from 15 milliseconds to several minutes . Surges often happen when large electrical devices switch on and off , or because of faulty wiring or utility problems . Spikes are less frequent , and often result from lightning strikes near connected power lines . <p> Surge protectors guard against excess voltage . CyberPower surge protectors offer data line protection , noise filters for electromagnetic **28;60;TOOLONG interference ( EMI/RFI ) , and impact-resistant casings for long service life . To protect computers and electronics after a major spike or surge , the metal oxide varistor ( MOV ) in a surge protector will shut off all power to the equipment . This prevents devices from operating without protection . <h> Sags , Brownouts , and Blackouts <p> Sags and brownouts occur when voltage drops below the normal range . In the United States , for example , nominal household current is 120 VAC . A sag can be as short as one cycle ( 1/60 of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A blackout ( complete loss of utility power ) can result in equipment damage , service interruption , and data loss . <p> A UPS system will protect against over voltages , like a surge protector , and provide continuous power during a brownout or blackout . Models with automatic voltage regulation ( AVR ) correct minor variations in input voltage . When utility power drops below acceptable levels , the UPS will supply power from its battery so you can keep working or playing . In case of a blackout , a UPS unit will provide power long enough to safely shut down your equipment and prevent data loss or equipment damage . <h> Staying Protected During Power Season <p> Severe summer weather such as lightning storms can often disrupt utility power . At the same time , heavy use of air conditioning drives up demand for electric power . This makes summer a smart time to add or upgrade power protection . <p> CyberPower UPS units , such as the BRG Intelligent LCD Series , offer guaranteed power protection for desktop computers , workstations , routers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They provide surge protection and battery backup with automatic voltage regulation ( AVR ) . Every BRG unit is now covered by a- five year product warranty for added peace of mind . <p> To find the best power protection and management products for your needs , try our online Surge Selector and- UPS Selector tools , or call one of our advisors at 952-403-9500 . <h> Summer Means Heavy Demand for Power <p> For people in North America , summer is power season . That 's when demand for electric power is the highest , especially from homes and businesses that use air conditioning . As that demand puts strain on what a power utility can provide , power problems become more common . Utility power is also vulnerable to severe weather , such as lightning , thunder storms , tornadoes and hurricanes . These weather events can affect transmission lines , utility poles , transformers , and other power delivery equipment . <p> The most common power problems that result from heavy demand are temporary drops in voltage , called brownouts , and long term outages , called blackouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office equipment , and may even harm sensitive electronics . <p> An uninterruptible power supply ( UPS ) will provide continuous power during brownouts . When utility power drops below acceptable levels , the UPS system will draw electric power from its battery so you can keep working or playing . When utility power returns to normal , the UPS will switch back to outputting utility power and go back to charging its battery . In case of a blackout , a UPS will provide power long enough to safely shut down your equipment and prevent data loss or equipment damage . <h> Find Your Requirements <p> To make sure you have the right kind and amount of power protection , determine three things : What level of UPS capacity you need , how much runtime the UPS should provide connected equipment , and what type of applications you need to support or maintain . <p> Capacity describes how much power a UPS system provides . The higher the capacity of the UPS , the larger quantity of connected equipment it can support , or equipment with a higher power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total power consumption of all the devices you expect to connect to the UPS . This is called the total load , and its the minimum capacity your UPS system should have . <p> Runtime is the number of minutes a UPS system can support a given load during a blackout . The minimum runtime needed is how long it takes to shut down your equipment safely . For a computer with attached equipment , such as external hard drives , make sure the runtime is long enough for the slowest device to finish switching off . <p> Application refers to the voltage and frequency requirements of the devices that will be connected to the UPS . In the United States and Canada , most computers , gaming systems , monitors , and home theater components use 120V AC power at 60 Hz . Make sure the voltage and frequency of the UPS model you choose match your connected devices . <h> Choose Your UPS <p> CyberPower UPS systems are designed as one of three types , called topologies : standby , line interactive , and double conversion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models allow connected equipment to run using utility power until the UPS detects a power problem , then it switches to battery power . <p> Line interactive UPS models offer a higher level of protection with automatic voltage regulation ( AVR ) . They use an autotransformer to regulate low voltages ( e.g. , brownouts ) and over voltages ( e.g. , spikes ) before allowing power to pass through to connected equipment . This preserves battery life of the UPS . <p> Double conversion UPS models deliver the highest levels of protection . They convert incoming utility power from AC to DC and back to AC . The output is clean , isolated sine wave power n++ ideal for critical equipment and applications . <h> The Bottom Line <p> For most of us , daily life runs on electric power . Brownouts and blackouts are inconvenient at best , keeping us from doing what we need or want . At worst , they cause irrecoverable data loss , equipment damage and critical downtime that cost you valuable time and money . Keep your cool during power season . Choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly when utility power falters or fails . <p> For more information , contact CyberPower Systems at 952-403-9500 . <h> Five-Year Warranty on BRG UPS Models <p> More than anything else , a UPS should provide peace of mind . That 's why every BRG model of Intelligent LCD UPS Series from CyberPower is now covered by a five year warranty " including the battery . Ideal for home and office equipment , these battery backup models correct minor power fluctuations ( like those experienced during power season ) without switching to battery power . They also feature a multifunction LCD panel that displays battery and power conditions , front panel USB charging ports , and PowerPanel- Personal Edition software to monitor and safely shutdown the UPS system . <p> CyberPower announces the launch of a vertical solutions microsite .

@@22777165 @2777165/ <p> An uninterruptible power supply ( UPS ) , also known as a battery backup , provides backup power when your regular power source fails or voltage drops to an unacceptable level . A UPS allows for the safe , orderly shutdown of a computer and connected equipment . The size and design of a UPS determine how long it will supply power . <h> UPS topologies <p> Different UPS topologies provide specific levels of power protection . A CyberPower UPS will belong to one of these three topologies : standby , line interactive , and double-conversion . <p> Standby is the most basic UPS topology . A standby UPS resorts to battery backup power in the event of common power problems such as a blackout , voltage sag , or voltage surge . When incoming utility power drops below or surges above safe voltage levels , the UPS switches to DC battery power and then inverts it to AC power to run connected equipment . These models are designed for consumer electronics , entry-level computers , POS systems , security systems , and other basic electronic equipment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to correct minor power fluctuations ( under-voltages and over voltages ) without switching to battery . This type of UPS has an autotransformer that regulates low voltages ( e.g. , brownouts ) and over voltages ( e.g. , swells ) without having to switch to battery . Line interactive UPS models are typically used for consumer electronics , PCs , gaming systems , home theater electronics , network equipment , and entry-to-mid-range servers . They provide power during such events as a blackout , voltage sag , voltage surge , or over-voltage . <p> A double-conversion ( online ) UPS provides consistent , clean , and near perfect power regardless of the condition of incoming power . This UPS converts incoming AC power to DC , and then back to AC . UPS systems with this technology operate on isolated DC power 100 percent of the time and have a zero transfer time because they never need to switch to DC power . Double-conversion UPS systems are designed to protect mission-critical IT equipment , data center installations , high-end servers , large telecom installations and storage applications , and advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage sag , voltage surge , over voltage , voltage spike , frequency noise , frequency variation , or harmonic distortion . <h> UPS output waveforms <p> CyberPower UPS systems have either sine wave or simulated sine wave output , depending upon the model . <p> Sine wave output : The highest quality waveform output is sine wave , which is a smooth , repetitive oscillation of AC power . Enterprise-level UPS systems produce sine wave power to operate sensitive electronic equipment . Sine wave output ensures that equipment utilizing Active PFC power supplies do not shut down when switching from utility power to battery power . <p> Simulated sine wave output is an approximated sine wave output waveform . It uses pulse wave modulation to generate a stepped , approximated sine wave to supply more cost-effective battery backup power for equipment that does not require sine wave output . The technology used to produce this type of power output is less expensive to manufacture and is common in standby and line interactive UPS systems . <p> Now in its twenty-third year , ENERGY STAR is a voluntary program of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy efficiency as a way for businesses and individuals to save money while protecting the climate .

Selecting a UPS with a load capacity 30-35% above the required power load offers the advantage of longer runtimes . This can lower the risk of overloading the UPS and causing an unnecessary UPS shutdown . <p> Although the initial outlay of a UPS increases with its size because of the higher capacity required for components , long-term operating costs typically decrease . When a UPS operates below maximum capacity , it reduces the stress on components . Sizing a UPS to run loads significantly lower than its capacity also increases spare capacity for future growth , along with extending runtimes . <p> The PowerPanel Business Edition software , included with every Smart App Sinewave UPS , enables an administrator to remotely manage each aspect of the UPS and facilitate the orderly automatic shutdown of connected equipment in the event of an extended power outage .

This feature is vital to data centers where seamless , uninterrupted equipment bootup is a necessity . <h> Sine Wave Power <p> In the U.S. , utility companies provide power to households and offices by distributing single phase alternating current ( AC ) power at a frequency of 60 Hz . Electrical power can be graphically depicted as a sine wave whereby the electrical signal alternates from +120 volts to -120 volts at a rate of 60 times per second ( 60 Hz ) . To enable more efficient operation of large , heavy equipment , utility companies provide commercial and industrial locations with three phase AC power which consists of three overlapping sine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strive to distribute 100% sine wave power , many factors can introduce electrical noise into the AC power signal in the form of sine wave distortions and as voltage sags , surges , spikes , or other irregularities . Sine wave power is important for the optimal functioning of sensitive desktop computers and related peripheral equipment . Without sine wave power output , microprocessor-based equipment can become inoperative or sustain damage from power signal distortions . <h> Active Power Factor Correction Supplies for IT Equipment <p> During the past thirty years , people have become more aware of the amount of energy used by IT equipment and devices . For many years , desktop computers and workstations inefficiently consumed power , partly due to the design of the power supplies which transformed AC power ( from the wall outlet ) to DC power ( used by computers ) . This voltage transformation was relatively inefficient as reflected in low power factor ratings . <p> In 1992 , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , in collaboration with advocates in the IT industry , developed the ENERGY STAR program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program is recognized as an international standard . <p> To comply with ENERGY STAR standards , manufacturers of desktop and workstation computers incorporate Active Power Factor Correction ( Active PFC ) as part of the engineering designs , enabling energy efficiencies of 95% or higher . Computers with Active PFC power supplies require sine wave AC power , as supplied by utility companies , for trouble-free operation . For this reason , sine wave UPS systems have become the best choice for backup power . <p> Simulated or stepped sine wave power , provided by entry-level UPS systems , may be problematic or incompatible with Active PFC devices . Sine wave power varies continuously from positive to negative . Simulated sine wave power mimics a sine wave by using a squared-off approximation . Due to this approximation , simulated sine wave power momentarily creates a zero power gap . When power is interrupted , a computer with an Active PFC power supply may not recognize incoming simulated sine wave power due to the zero output present in the approximated wave . This could cause the system to unexpectedly shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Eco Mode <p> ECO Mode- is a form of bypass technology that can be switched on full time , set for noncritical times ( such as nights and weekends ) , or switched off . This flexibility can help conserve power and save money . <p> CyberPower Smart App Online Series UPS systems include a Generator Mode setting specifically designed to work with generators . With varying loads , the frequency output from generators can be erratic . This erratic output can make it difficult for a UPS without a Generator Mode setting to recognize the input power , causing the UPS to function on battery power only . With Generator Mode , the UPS can automatically adjust to frequency fluctuations and maintain a full charge of the batteries .

A UPS allows for the safe , orderly shutdown of a computer and connected equipment . The size and design of a UPS determine how long it will supply power . <h> UPS topologies <p> Different UPS topologies provide specific levels of power protection . A CyberPower UPS will belong to one of these three topologies : standby , line interactive , and double-conversion . <p> Standby is the most basic UPS topology . A standby UPS resorts to battery backup power in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage sag , or voltage surge . When incoming utility power drops below or surges above safe voltage levels , the UPS switches to DC battery power and then inverts it to AC power to run connected equipment . These models are designed for consumer electronics , entry-level computers , POS systems , security systems , and other basic electronic equipment . <p> A line interactive UPS incorporates technology which allows it to correct minor power fluctuations ( under-voltages and over voltages ) without switching to battery . This type of UPS has an autotransformer that regulates low voltages ( e.g. , brownouts ) and over voltages ( e.g. , swells ) without having to switch to battery . Line interactive UPS models are typically used for consumer electronics , PCs , gaming systems , home theater electronics , network equipment , and entry-to-mid-range servers . They provide power during such events as a blackout , voltage sag , voltage surge , or over-voltage . <p> A double-conversion ( online ) UPS provides consistent , clean , and near perfect power regardless of the condition of incoming power . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to AC . UPS systems with this technology operate on isolated DC power 100 percent of the time and have a zero transfer time because they never need to switch to DC power . Double-conversion UPS systems are designed to protect mission-critical IT equipment , data center installations , high-end servers , large telecom installations and storage applications , and advanced network equipment from damage caused by a power blackout , voltage sag , voltage surge , over voltage , voltage spike , frequency noise , frequency variation , or harmonic distortion . <h> UPS output waveforms <p> CyberPower UPS systems have either sine wave or simulated sine wave output , depending upon the model . <p> Sine wave output : The highest quality waveform output is sine wave , which is a smooth , repetitive oscillation of AC power . Enterprise-level UPS systems produce sine wave power to operate sensitive electronic equipment . Sine wave output ensures that equipment utilizing Active PFC power supplies do not shut down when switching from utility power to battery power . <p> Simulated sine wave output is an approximated sine wave output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped , approximated sine wave to supply more cost-effective battery backup power for equipment that does not require sine wave output . The technology used to produce this type of power output is less expensive to manufacture and is common in standby and line interactive UPS systems .

That 's when demand for electric power is the highest , especially from homes and businesses that use air conditioning . As that demand puts strain on what a power utility can provide , power problems become more common . Utility power is also vulnerable to severe weather , such as lightning , thunder storms , tornadoes and hurricanes . These weather events can affect transmission lines , utility poles , transformers , and other power delivery equipment . <p> The most common power problems that result from heavy demand are temporary drops in voltage , called brownouts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconvenient if you 're using home and office equipment , and may even harm sensitive electronics . <p> An uninterruptible power supply ( UPS ) will provide continuous power during brownouts . When utility power drops below acceptable levels , the UPS system will draw electric power from its battery so you can keep working or playing . When utility power returns to normal , the UPS will switch back to outputting utility power and go back to charging its battery . In case of a blackout , a UPS will provide power long enough to safely shut down your equipment and prevent data loss or equipment damage . <h> Find Your Requirements <p> To make sure you have the right kind and amount of power protection , determine three things : What level of UPS capacity you need , how much runtime the UPS should provide connected equipment , and what type of applications you need to support or maintain . <p> Capacity describes how much power a UPS system provides . The higher the capacity of the UPS , the larger quantity of connected equipment it can support , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your required capacity , add up the total power consumption of all the devices you expect to connect to the UPS . This is called the total load , and its the minimum capacity your UPS system should have . <p> Runtime is the number of minutes a UPS system can support a given load during a blackout . The minimum runtime needed is how long it takes to shut down your equipment safely . For a computer with attached equipment , such as external hard drives , make sure the runtime is long enough for the slowest device to finish switching off . <p> Application refers to the voltage and frequency requirements of the devices that will be connected to the UPS . In the United States and Canada , most computers , gaming systems , monitors , and home theater components use 120V AC power at 60 Hz . Make sure the voltage and frequency of the UPS model you choose match your connected devices . <h> Choose Your UPS <p> CyberPower UPS systems are designed as one of three types , called topologies : standby , line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each . <p> Standby UPS models allow connected equipment to run using utility power until the UPS detects a power problem , then it switches to battery power . <p> Line interactive UPS models offer a higher level of protection with automatic voltage regulation ( AVR ) . They use an autotransformer to regulate low voltages ( e.g. , brownouts ) and over voltages ( e.g. , spikes ) before allowing power to pass through to connected equipment . This preserves battery life of the UPS . <p> Double conversion UPS models deliver the highest levels of protection . They convert incoming utility power from AC to DC and back to AC . The output is clean , isolated sine wave power n++ ideal for critical equipment and applications . <h> The Bottom Line <p> For most of us , daily life runs on electric power . Brownouts and blackouts are inconvenient at best , keeping us from doing what we need or want . At worst , they cause irrecoverable data loss , equipment damage and critical downtime that cost you valuable time and money . Keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your equipment and devices running smoothly when utility power falters or fails . <p> For more information , contact CyberPower Systems at 952-403-9500 . <h> Five-Year Warranty on BRG UPS Models <p> More than anything else , a UPS should provide peace of mind . That 's why every BRG model of Intelligent LCD UPS Series from CyberPower is now covered by a five year warranty " including the battery .

SBM also reduces the heat produced by a UPS battery and reduces battery deterioration . <h> Extendable LCD Control Panel <p> Often a UPS is installed in a hard-to-reach area , such as a crowded IT closet , the bottom of a rack , or on the floor . A removable LCD control panel allows for easy access and can be placed up to ten feet away from the UPS when connected by a DB26 cable ( sold separately ) . <p> Manual Battery Test enables user to run a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capacity UPS for Longer Runtimes <p> To determine the size of the UPS that you need , identify the total power load ( measure in VA/Watts ) of the connected equipment , along with the amount of runtime required ( in minutes ) . Also , think about any equipment that might be connected to the UPS in the future , which could affect the calculations for load and runtime . <p> Estimating expected UPS runtimes can be challenging , particularly when the consistency of the utility power is not well known . Selecting a UPS with a load capacity 30-35% above the required power load offers the advantage of longer runtimes . This can lower the risk of overloading the UPS and causing an unnecessary UPS shutdown . <p> Although the initial outlay of a UPS increases with its size because of the higher capacity required for components , long-term operating costs typically decrease . When a UPS operates below maximum capacity , it reduces the stress on components . Sizing a UPS to run loads significantly lower than its capacity also increases spare capacity for future growth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software , included with every Smart App Sinewave UPS , enables an administrator to remotely manage each aspect of the UPS and facilitate the orderly automatic shutdown of connected equipment in the event of an extended power outage . This software also provides comprehensive network power management for corporate servers and critical workstations supported by the UPS , such as application/operating system shutdown , event logging , reporting , alerts and notifications . <p> Programmable Outlet Control <p> Smart App UPS systems allow programming of critical outlets and non-critical outlets , giving administrators the ability to prioritize outlets and increase battery backup runtimes for the most critical equipment during extended power outages . Programmable outlet control also gives an administrator the option to delay-start non-critical outlets , permitting the internal batteries to fully recharge more quickly . This feature is vital to data centers where seamless , uninterrupted equipment bootup is a necessity . <h> Sine Wave Power <p> In the U.S. , utility companies provide power to households and offices by distributing single phase alternating current ( AC ) power at a frequency of 60 Hz . Electrical power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical signal alternates from +120 volts to -120 volts at a rate of 60 times per second ( 60 Hz ) . To enable more efficient operation of large , heavy equipment , utility companies provide commercial and industrial locations with three phase AC power which consists of three overlapping sine waves offset by 120 degrees . <p> Although utility companies strive to distribute 100% sine wave power , many factors can introduce electrical noise into the AC power signal in the form of sine wave distortions and as voltage sags , surges , spikes , or other irregularities . Sine wave power is important for the optimal functioning of sensitive desktop computers and related peripheral equipment . Without sine wave power output , microprocessor-based equipment can become inoperative or sustain damage from power signal distortions . <h> Active Power Factor Correction Supplies for IT Equipment <p> During the past thirty years , people have become more aware of the amount of energy used by IT equipment and devices . For many years , desktop computers and workstations inefficiently consumed power , partly due to the design of the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to DC power ( used by computers ) . This voltage transformation was relatively inefficient as reflected in low power factor ratings . <p> In 1992 , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , in collaboration with advocates in the IT industry , developed the ENERGY STAR program to prompt the development of energy-efficient products . Today this program is recognized as an international standard . <p> To comply with ENERGY STAR standards , manufacturers of desktop and workstation computers incorporate Active Power Factor Correction ( Active PFC ) as part of the engineering designs , enabling energy efficiencies of 95% or higher . Computers with Active PFC power supplies require sine wave AC power , as supplied by utility companies , for trouble-free operation . For this reason , sine wave UPS systems have become the best choice for backup power . <p> Simulated or stepped sine wave power , provided by entry-level UPS systems , may be problematic or incompatible with Active PFC devices . Sine wave power varies continuously from positive to negative . Simulated sine wave power mimics a sine wave by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sine wave power momentarily creates a zero power gap . When power is interrupted , a computer with an Active PFC power supply may not recognize incoming simulated sine wave power due to the zero output present in the approximated wave . This could cause the system to unexpectedly shut down or sustain system component stress . <h> GreenPower UPS Technology : Eco Mode <p> ECO Mode- is a form of bypass technology that can be switched on full time , set for noncritical times ( such as nights and weekends ) , or switched off . This flexibility can help conserve power and save money . <p> CyberPower Smart App Online Series UPS systems include a Generator Mode setting specifically designed to work with generators . With varying loads , the frequency output from generators can be erratic . This erratic output can make it difficult for a UPS without a Generator Mode setting to recognize the input power , causing the UPS to function on battery power only . With Generator Mode , the UPS can automatically adjust to frequency fluctuations and maintain a full charge of the batteries .

You 'll find explanations about how particular products function , tips about how to solve common power problems , information about efficient energy use , and ideas about how to save money and prolong product life . <h> A Cheat Sheet for Buying Your Next PDU <p> June 8 , 2017 by Product Knowledge Team <p> If your organization is growing , so are your technology requirements . At some point , you 'll need more electrical outlets than you have . Power strips may be enough for home offices , but anyone with plans for growth should understand the benefits of using a PDU . <p> This guide will review the basics of power distribution for business environments to help you make a confident and informed buying decision . <h> First things first . What is a PDU ? <p> A power distribution unit ( PDU ) distributes reliable network power to multiple devices . It does not generate or condition power , but delivers AC power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generator , or utility power source to servers , networking hardware , telecom equipment , and other devices . <h> What does a PDU do ? <p> In its most basic form , a PDU does the same job as a power strip . It uses current from a single source , usually a wall outlet , to power multiple devices , such as computers , peripherals , and networking gear . PDUs are designed for installation in equipment racks , keeping power within reach of rack mounted devices such as servers , switches , routers , or cooling fans . <p> PDUs are most often used in data centers , network closets , VoIP phone systems , and industrial environments . <h> Does it do anything else ? <p> Beyond standard power distribution , PDUs are for in-depth power management and monitoring . Below are eight of the most common PDU types available on the market . <p> Basic <p> Metered <p> Monitored <p> Switched <p> Switched Metered-by-Outlet <p> Metered Auto Transfer Switch ( ATS ) <p> Switched Auto Transfer Switch ( ATS ) <p> Maintenance Bypass <h> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power from a single source to multiple devices but are not strictly PDUs . They are designed for use with equipment that needs to be guarded against voltage spikes and surges but does not require battery backup . Because the primary feature of these units is protection against over voltages , they are considered surge protectors and not PDUs . <h> Which type of PDU is right for me ? <p> To find the right model for your needs , ask yourself the following six questions . <p> 1 . Where will I install it ? 2 . What kind of input power do I have ? 3 . How much power does my equipment need ? 4 . How many outlets do my devices need ? 5 . What kinds of plugs do my devices have ? 6 . Do I need other features ? <h> 1 . Where will I install it ? <p> PDU models are typically available in 1U or 2U heights for horizontal mounting . They can also be mounted vertically , known as 0U . Depending on the model , they can be mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a shelf . <p> Horizontal PDUs are designed for mounting in EIA-310 standard 19-inch equipment racks . They can be placed above , below , or between the components they power . <p> Vertical PDUs look like tall power strips . They fit on the upright rails of a rack enclosure and do not take horizontal mounting space away from other equipment . <h> 2 . What kind of input power do I have ? <p> Depending on your location and building type , you may have either single-phase or three-phase power . If you 're not completely sure , ask a licensed electrician . Here 's the difference : <p> Single-phase power alternates between positive and negative voltage ; in the United States , the rate is 60 cycles per second . That means the wave has zero voltage every time it moves from positive to negative and back . Most household and office power are single-phase and work with the following receptacle ( outlet ) types : <p> Three-phase power eliminates these moments of zero voltage by offsetting three simultaneous waves . When one wave reaches zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points in the cycle . Three-phase power is common in commercial and industrial environments . <p> Most offices have single-phase power " but make sure you know before buying any new equipment . <h> 3 . How much power does my equipment need ? <p> The amount of power consumed by each device should be listed in volts and amperes ( VA ) or in watts ( W ) in the user manual or on the equipment itself . Add up the total consumption for your equipment and write it down . Your power source " utility power from a service panel , local power from a generator , or backup power from a UPS " should be higher than that . <p> Note : Many devices use automatic switching power supplies that can be used with voltages from 120 to 240 . If your power source is 120V ( typical for North America ) , base your calculations on that figure . If it 's 200V/230V ( typical for Europe and Asia ) , use the higher number . For input amperage , use the figure listed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected to one UPS can provide conditioned power to a smaller network . Larger and more complex installations may need multiple PDUs and a large-capacity UPS system . <h> 4 . How many outlets do my devices need ? <p> This question is probably the easiest to answer , but take it seriously . The PDU you choose should have at least as many outlets as the number of plugs you need to connect . If a device has more than one plug , or if one device has to be plugged into another , adjust your count . And remember to leave room for more devices , such as lights or cooling fans . <h> 5 . What kinds of plugs do my devices have ? <p> Each PDU can support several devices . The plug shape corresponds to the required voltage and amperage . CyberPower offers PDU models to fit- the following plug- types : <h> 6 . Do I need other features ? <p> A basic PDU shares a single power source with multiple devices . It simplifies the management of rack equipment and makes a valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , from measuring demand to protecting against downtime to allowing remote control through software . <p> 1 . A Basic PDU distributes unfiltered AC power from a UPS system , generator , or utility source to multiple connected devices . <p> 2 . A Metered PDU distributes network-grade power and meters load in amps to prevent overloads and help users optimize load levels . <p> 3 . A Monitored PDU distributes network-grade power and helps users prevent downtime due to overloads or other power events . It supports local management with a digital meter display and remote monitoring through an SNMP network interface . <p> 4 . A Switched PDU distributes network-grade power and allows users to control outlets individually or collectively . A digital meter provides information on load and voltage and supports local control ; an SNMP connection enables remote monitoring and control . <p> 7 . A Switched Auto Transfer Switch ( ATS ) - PDU has all the features of a switched PDU , plus the ability to connect separate power sources to single-corded connected equipment for redundancy . An LCD screen can display amperage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilowatts , and information about hardware and firmware versions . A standard SNMP card allows remote monitoring and management over a network connection . <p> 8 . A Maintenance Bypass PDU helps prevent downtime . It allows the seamless transfer of an electrical load from UPS power to utility power for continuous operation of connected equipment when performing maintenance , replacing batteries , or installing a new UPS .

Because utility power functions normally most of the time , the bypass design allows for substantial energy savings . This technology also reduces heat generation , an important factor in decreasing operating costs . <h> Sine Wave Power <p> In the U.S. , utility companies provide power to households and offices by distributing single phase alternating current ( AC ) power at a frequency of 60 Hz . Electrical power can be graphically depicted as a sine wave whereby the electrical signal alternates from +120 volts to -120 volts at a rate of 60 times per second ( 60 Hz ) . To enable more efficient operation of large , heavy equipment , utility companies provide commercial and industrial locations with three phase AC power which consists of three overlapping sine waves offset by 120 degrees . <p> Although utility companies strive to distribute 100% sine wave power , many factors can introduce electrical noise into the AC power signal in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spikes , or other irregularities . Sine wave power is important for the optimal functioning of sensitive desktop computers and related peripheral equipment . Without sine wave power output , microprocessor-based equipment can become inoperative or sustain damage from power signal distortions . <h> Active Power Factor Correction Supplies for IT Equipment <p> During the past thirty years , people have become more aware of the amount of energy used by IT equipment and devices . For many years , desktop computers and workstations inefficiently consumed power , partly due to the design of the power supplies which transformed AC power ( from the wall outlet ) to DC power ( used by computers ) . This voltage transformation was relatively inefficient as reflected in low power factor ratings . <p> In 1992 , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , in collaboration with advocates in the IT industry , developed the ENERGY STAR program to prompt the development of energy-efficient products . Today this program is recognized as an international standard . <p> To comply with ENERGY STAR standards , manufacturers of desktop and workstation computers incorporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the engineering designs , enabling energy efficiencies of 95% or higher . Computers with Active PFC power supplies require sine wave AC power , as supplied by utility companies , for trouble-free operation . For this reason , sine wave UPS systems have become the best choice for backup power . <p> Simulated or stepped sine wave power , provided by entry-level UPS systems , may be problematic or incompatible with Active PFC devices . Sine wave power varies continuously from positive to negative . Simulated sine wave power mimics a sine wave by using a squared-off approximation . Due to this approximation , simulated sine wave power momentarily creates a zero power gap . When power is interrupted , a computer with an Active PFC power supply may not recognize incoming simulated sine wave power due to the zero output present in the approximated wave . This could cause the system to unexpectedly shut down or sustain system component stress . <p> The internal cooling fan will only run when it is required . CyberPower UPS systems utilize an internal thermometer which activates the fan when the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle ( not using battery power ) , it is completely normal for the fan to not be running .

The current PR3000LCDRTXL2U , standard with a black and white LCD , uses the BP48V75ART2U battery pack . <h> Higher Capacity UPS for Longer Runtimes <p> To determine the size of the UPS that you need , identify the total power load ( measure in VA/Watts ) of the connected equipment , along with the amount of runtime required ( in minutes ) . Also , think about any equipment that might be connected to the UPS in the future , which could affect the calculations for load and runtime . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consistency of the utility power is not well known . Selecting a UPS with a load capacity 30-35% above the required power load offers the advantage of longer runtimes . This can lower the risk of overloading the UPS and causing an unnecessary UPS shutdown . <p> Although the initial outlay of a UPS increases with its size because of the higher capacity required for components , long-term operating costs typically decrease . When a UPS operates below maximum capacity , it reduces the stress on components . Sizing a UPS to run loads significantly lower than its capacity also increases spare capacity for future growth , along with extending runtimes.

This flexibility can help conserve power and save money . <p> Bypass Design : Our patented bypass design allows current to bypass the transformer and automatic voltage regulation ( AVR ) when utility power is normal , thus reducing energy consumption and associated costs . Because utility power functions normally most of the time , the bypass design allows for substantial energy savings . This technology also reduces heat generation , an important factor in decreasing operating costs . <p> High-Efficiency Design : significantly decreases power consumption to create an ultra-efficient backup battery for home and office use . 12553 @qwx212553 12560 @qwx212560 12617 @qwx212617
