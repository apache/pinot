After a few days , I would dread the idea of sitting quietly for 30 minutes letting my silly thoughts run wild . <p> Yet for the past 7 months , I 've meditated for 10-15 minutes a day , usually 5 days a week or more . <p> I 've kept at it , the results have begun to show , and its becoming more enjoyable . I still do n't  ENJOY it , like I enjoy a bowl of Ichiran ramen , but the anticipation no longer fills me with dread . <p> How I meditate <p> The breakthrough came , like most behavior changes , when I realized that starting ( and staying ) unambitious was key . <p> In my failed attempts , I would start with a goal of 30 minutes . And I would try to add 5 minutes every day , hoping I could attain a Buddha-amount of focus with a Kesha-amount of time . <p> This did n't  work . <p> So instead of 30 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just meditated for 5 minutes , I 'd consider that a win . This made it MUCH easier to fit into my day , and I did n't  procrastinate . <p> After 7 months , I 'm at 15 minutes a day with no plans to increase the time . Some days Ill only do 10 , and others I 'll do 25 or 30 . But being unambitious has made all the difference . <p> I do a somewhat standard zen-like process . <p> Here are my steps : <p> I set my iPhone timer for 15 minutes . This helps me stop wondering constantly how many minutes are left <p> I find a quiet , dimly-lit place ( usually my bedroom ) . <p> I sit in a chair and overlap my hands . Keep my back straight and head up . Sitting cross-legged on the ground is too uncomfortable <p> I close my eyes , and " check in " with my body . Starting with my toes , I notice and feel each part of my body as I move through the legs , torso , and head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and imagine a white room . Sometimes I focus on the buzzing sound in my head , sometimes I focus on the mental room , sometimes I focus on " nothingness " <p> Often I 'll begin wondering what I 'm eating for dinnerif I should scratch that itch on my legwhen these moments happen , I simply let go of the thought and return to the white room or nothingness . With meditation you have to accept that your mind will wander , what you 're working on is your ability to let go when it happens and return your focus <p> When the timer goes off , I slowly open my eyes and return to reality <p> Its effect on me <p> When I finish a typical 15-minute session , my immediate feeling is one of calm , detachment , and elevation . Its like being high , while you 're fully aware . It does n't  matter how hectic the day has been , I always feel calm after meditating . Everything moves languidly . <p> This intense feeling lasts perhaps 15-30 minutes , and slowly dies off . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detached . Sometimes the change is obvious , other times it feels like I jump right back into the rat race . <p> Its not a shield to protect against negative arrows , but more like Wolverines ability to rapidly self-heal after being wounded . And after 7 months now , some things which used to bother me simply do n't  anymore . I hope this side of meditation grows over time . <p> " Buddha had it right when he said craving , desire and attachment are the sources of suffering .

Success is never the cure for envy . Eliminate envy by enjoying what life brings you , by working hard , and by avoiding comparison with those you think more blessed than you . <p> Extreme modesty is itself a form of envy . Measured modesty is a virtue , but extreme modesty should n't be similarly regarded . An overly modest person needs reassurance to do things which they 're very capable of doing . <p> <p> Envy is closely related to competition . We do n't envy people we think are out of reach .

Eventually we 'll arrive at a more just social system , but for now , the poor envy the rich , poor nations envy rich nations , women envy men , the chaste envy the promiscuous . <p> While envy can be productive and lead to justice between classes , nations , and even genders , the justice that results is the worst kind , the kind that hurts the fortunate , rather than helping the unfortunate . If you desire profound , positive societal change , you should root for reasons other than envy to be the driving force . <p> <p> Most envy which seems on the surface professional is actually sexual in nature .

Dominic Toretto values family : <p> OConner : Maybe the Letty we once knew is gone Toretto : You do n't  turn your back on family , even when they do <p> In better times <p> From a biological perspective , were here to make babies . The Gaos have been doing so for generations which is why Im alive . <p> That means at some point I need to- find a wife , have kids , and do a semi-competent job raising them . <p> Clay Christensen talks about how we often underinvest in long-term goals ( like actively raising our kids ) , and overinvest in short term ones ( like answering work emails ) . Then we hit 50 and wonder why our kids do n't  come home for Christmas holiday . Hmm <p> Family knows you . <p> Your mom cleaned your naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconditionally . I could n't even begin to describe how much moms must love their sons . Something we miss out on as dudes . <p> Imagine feeling a LIFE grow inside you , heart beating , legs kicking , getting bigger in your stomach and then it comes out and it grows and one day its taller than you and healthy and beautiful . <p> And YOU as the mom made that happen . Sure sperm played a part , but the sperm were involved , the MOM IS COMMITTED . <p> I wont even begin to talk about dads , cousins , uncles and aunts , etc . Needless to say they have always been there for me and for that Im incredibly grateful even if I sometimes do a poor job showing it . <p> The only problem with family is that they know the worst sides of you too all the embarrassing mistakes that you 've tried to forget . Sometimes the distance we feel with family members is because we push them away but that 's just a reflection of our own insecurities . <p> I notice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

Health <p> The very fact that I can walk to a coffee shop and write this blog post means I 'm blessed . <p> Im blessed to have the physical strength to walk , the mental strength to write , the overall health to be productive . <p> Health is one of Maslows fundamental priorities . We take it for granted because its always there , until its not . The minute its taken away is when all the so-called-priorities in life , like getting laid or making that first million , seem less important . <p> I 'm starting to understand why people who lose their legs in catastrophic accidents return to their pre-accident happiness levels in 6 months . Whether conscious or not , theyve replaced what they had taken away with an increased appreciation of what 's left . <p> I 'm obsessed with- living forever- not because living to 250 is the most important thing in my life ( although who am I kidding , thatd be awesome ) , but because it reminds me to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and eat healthy foods . <p> 3 . Friends <p> I 'm grateful for friends who put up with my shit .

The stories , the trust , the respect that builds over time . <p> In general , I 'm grateful for GOOD people . Most moderately successful people are selfish and full of ego. - To be truly good considerate , genuine , and reliable is a gift . One I do n't  yet have . <p> 4 .

People who know me are a little sick of it by now . <p> I have some half-assed guesses why , but it still surprises how much I enjoy walking around Japan and eating food in Japan and meeting people in Japan . I feel like its filling a piece of my soul . <p> Japan : the only country where I continually lament the fact that it took me 28 years to visit . Why ? I now have fewer years to go back . Silly , but it expresses how deeply the experience has affected me . <p> At some point , I 'd love to write a book about Japanese culture . Spend a long time there understanding the people and their lives , and share that with the rest of the world . <p> Here are more over-generalized , marginally-researched observations after 3 days in Fukuoka . <p> 1 .

A McDonalds in Fukuoka had nothing but solo tables for diners . <p> Maybe in such a collective society , individual time and space are highly prized ? <p> 3 . Where are the young people ? <p> I spent 3 weeks in Shanghai prior to the trip . In Shanghai , you are overwhelmed by young people .

Scent of a shopper <p> Shopping in Japan reminds me of the role scents play in creating great user experiences . <p> The Wynn Hotel in Vegas is a great example . Walk in and , with that first inhale , you KNOW you 're in the Wynn . You KNOW you 're in Vegas . It relaxes you AND energizes you , and after a few visits you crave that smell .

It helps nurture in me something that I lack . The cultures commitment to details and rules in all facets of life also means that , to an extent , you are required to make fewer small decisions in a given day ( for example , part of me is annoyed that at Starbucks , I need to specify cup size , and type of tea not just green but tazo or green tips or whattheheckever , and hot or coldand that 's one of the simpler drinks ) . <p> That means I can spend more time thinking about stuff that matters .

There just do n't  seem to- be any- new wow moments : <p> Its still most enjoyable to meditate in the morning ( when it also has the greatest benefit for- my mood and productivity ) <p> Ten to fifteen minutes is still my sweet spot . Anything longer , and I create excuses- to not do it . Anything shorter , and its effects are n't  as noticeable- or consistent . <p> I still practice a simple form of meditation : what could best be described as zen meditation , also known as- seated meditation or- zazen. - I sit down- and empty the mind , allowing thoughts and feelings to arise and depart- without judgment or attachment , until my iPhone timer rings <p> That 's not to say the time has- been wasted. - There have been a few- new realizations- about meditation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity in your- pre-frontal cortex , which is the brain region that creates a boundary- between yourself and the world around you .

Its similar to the effect of certain drugs , but cleaner and more peaceful <p> Meditations impact- is mixed . Some days are good , most days are meh , and some days feel wasted . But occasionally , on the great days , very occasionally , - the impact of meditation- is instant and obvious and washes over- me like a two hour swedish massage . My eyes- will be- closed . I 'm trying to relax . Suddenly , instead of seeing a- vast void of- blackness , suddenly , I 'm looking right in front of me , - at the here and now of the darkness , right at the front of my eyes , the back of my eyelids .

Yes , I agree that its probably better than no practice , but , if you 'll excuse this ragged- analogy , guided meditation is like learning- to appreciate silence by listening to classical music .

Each neuron is a guest , yammering away , bumping into furniture , slurping drinks . Meditation is like sending those guests home , and only close friends remain and you can have a quiet , relaxed conversation . <p> I *think* I do zen meditation , although I 've never been properly trained . Usually , I sit in silence for 20 minutes in the morning . Some people hate zen meditation because they 're held hostage by intruding , conflicting , interminable thoughts ( those pesky partiers ) . What you should think instead is : it 's ok to have those thoughts , meditation is not about absence of thought , but rather awareness of them and learning to let go . To overuse my metaphor , its learning to politely ask uninvited guests to leave . <p> I generally sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it 's stiff muscles or a bony ass but a cross-legged position is oddly uncomfortable . <p> Sometimes I 'll experience a moment of insight , the sort of lightbulb going off that happens while you 're thinking in the shower , and it 's cool to realize the insight happens because LESS is going on in your brain , not more . <p> After meditating , time slows down , things move more slowly . My guess for why : you 've reduced focus on the brains contents and increased focus on your environment and the present moment . Its like Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi 's concept of flowwhen you are in flow you lose track of time . <p> Mornings are best for me . I struggle to meditate during the day , because there are meetings and deadlines and distractions , and when I try to meditate in the evening , I often fall sleep or create some lazy excuse to read or watch Netflix . <p> 86148 @qwx286148 <p> Meditation is awesome .

An incomplete list : <p> Improves focus <p> Reduces stress <p> Lowers blood pressure <p> Diminishes feelings of pain <p> It literally changes the structure and composition of your brain , increasing gray matter and the frequency of different brain waves <p> Here are some good articles if you 're interested : <p> NYT How meditation may change the brainMIT The benefits of meditationPsychology Today The benefits of meditation <p> Because Im interested in anything that can improve my physical AND mental health with no major downsides ( unlike recreational drugs ) , it seemed a natural step in my quest to live forever . <p> For years , I tried and failed to start a meditation routine .

And I would try to add 5 minutes every day , hoping I could attain a Buddha-amount of focus with a Kesha-amount of time . <p> This did n't  work . <p> So instead of 30 minutes , I set 5 minutes as the goal . If I just meditated for 5 minutes , I 'd consider that a win . This made it MUCH easier to fit into my day , and I did n't  procrastinate . <p> After 7 months , I 'm at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Some days Ill only do 10 , and others I 'll do 25 or 30 . But being unambitious has made all the difference . <p> I do a somewhat standard zen-like process . <p> Here are my steps : <p> I set my iPhone timer for 15 minutes . This helps me stop wondering constantly how many minutes are left <p> I find a quiet , dimly-lit place ( usually my bedroom ) . <p> I sit in a chair and overlap my hands . Keep my back straight and head up . Sitting cross-legged on the ground is too uncomfortable <p> I close my eyes , and " check in " with my body . Starting with my toes , I notice and feel each part of my body as I move through the legs , torso , and head <p> Once I 'm in my head , I clear my mind and imagine a white room . Sometimes I focus on the buzzing sound in my head , sometimes I focus on the mental room , sometimes I focus on " nothingness " <p> Often I 'll begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itch on my legwhen these moments happen , I simply let go of the thought and return to the white room or nothingness . With meditation you have to accept that your mind will wander , what you 're working on is your ability to let go when it happens and return your focus <p> When the timer goes off , I slowly open my eyes and return to reality <p> Its effect on me <p> When I finish a typical 15-minute session , my immediate feeling is one of calm , detachment , and elevation . Its like being high , while you 're fully aware . It does n't  matter how hectic the day has been , I always feel calm after meditating . Everything moves languidly . <p> This intense feeling lasts perhaps 15-30 minutes , and slowly dies off . For the rest of the day , I 'm calmer and more detached . Sometimes the change is obvious , other times it feels like I jump right back into the rat race . <p> Its not a shield to protect against negative arrows , but more like Wolverines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 months now , some things which used to bother me simply do n't  anymore . I hope this side of meditation grows over time . <p> " Buddha had it right when he said craving , desire and attachment are the sources of suffering . " Chris Michel <p> meditation works to reduce EXACTLY those feelings . <p> Its definitely improved my focus . I 've long believed focus is a muscle which gets stronger with use , and meditation is a great focus-workout . <p> One fear of mine ? By minimizing lows , I also reduce highs the true pleasures from life . I feel like this is already happening , to a small degreeits something I 'm paying close attention to , and for me , giving up a little maximum pleasure is worth reducing the frequent little pains . <p> Looking ahead <p> Like regular exercise and eating healthy , meditation is staying in my daily routine . In another 3-6 months , I 'll increase my minimum time to 20 minutes but I want to stay distinctly unambitious.

Maybe I do n't  forget it right away , but time wins in the end . Its- always deleting- what Ive learned . I hate it . Because it wastes time , our most precious resource , and I hate- wasted time- more than I hate people who are- perpetually late , and cafes that are too cool for- wifi . <p> So Ive developed two methods to retain knowledge , especially the important bits .

Method two is more complicated but its helpful in my quest to become a good writer : to rewrite things , whether quotes or short stories or essays . <p> When I stumbled upon The Little Book of Talent ( thanks Derek ! ) , the 52 tips were perfect for method two . The book is a companion to Daniel Coyles other book , The Talent Code , which I also read and summarized . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is a- rewritten version of his 52 tips ! <p> 1 . VISUALIZE a " future you " who 's mastered your desired skill ( like Michael Phelps visualizes each performance down to likely drops of water ) 2 . REPEAT the best performances of that skill for 15 minutes a day ( if you 're a comedian , learn to recite a Louis CK routine , word-for-word and pause-for-pause ) 3 . STEAL from anyone better than you ( this is why musical families produce musical prodigies ) 4 . RECORD your progress ( like a daily journal ) 5 . BE STUPID , act silly to experiment and expand what 's possible6 . BE POOR : use simple , sparse environments to focus and motivate you ( like the founders of Google starting in a garage ) 7 . HARD OR SOFT ? Determine if you 're learning a hard skill ( like a tennis forehand ) or a soft one ( like writing ) ? 8 . For hard skills , be the KARATE KID : wax on and wax off . Be precise , slow , and careful 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment , explore , and challenge yourself10 . DO HARD : prioritize hard skills . In the long run , they 're more important 11 . FORGET PRODIGIES . Believe you 'll only get there through effort and persistence 12 . FIND THE RIGHT COACH : someone who is tough , blunt , active , usually older , and enjoys teaching fundamentals ( I am reminded of John Woodens reputation ) 13 . LIVE in the sweet spot , which happens when you 're fully engaged and struggling just enough ( what Mikhail C calls flow ) 14 . MEASURE # of tough reps finished , not # of hours spent 15 . CHUNK IT . Reduce each skill into small , coherent chunks 16 . MASTER A CHUNK at a time ( like a difficult run in a song , or an algorithm in programming ) 17 . FRUSTRATE yourself . When you 're frustrated , remember : that 's when you 're improving most18 . Practice a little each day , instead of a lot in spurts 19 . PLAY : Do n't  do drills . Create and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each chunk to improve your memory22 . Make a mistake ? Stop everything . Pay attention . Understand what you did wrong . Then do it right . 23 . VISUALIZE your neurons creating connections , getting thicker 24 . VISUALIZE your neurons speeding up , getting more efficient 25 . PLACE LIMITS and rules on yourself to challenge your skills 26 . DO IT SLOW , as slowly as possible27 . CLOSE YOUR EYES and do it . Use your left hand if you 're right handed . 28 . MIME IT 29 . When you do it right ( finally ! ) : notice it . mark it . replay it in your mind30 . Take NAPS 31 . EXAGGERATE : make it much bigger , or much smaller 32 . SET NEW GOALS just out of reach . Stretch for them 33 . WRITE IT DOWN : to learn from a book , write it down , summarize it , organize it 34 . With mistakes , use the SANDWICH technique : do it right . do it wrong . then do it right again 35 . Practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest 10 minutes , do a rep , rest 10 minutes , do a rep , rest 36 . TEST YOURSELF DAILY 37 . Plan your practice using the REPS framework : Reach and Repeat ; Engage ; Purposeful ; Strong , Speedy Feedback 38 . STOP WHEN TIRED . Do n't create bad habits39 . Practice immediately after a performance , when the mistakes are fresh ( this is my favorite tip ) 40 . Before sleep , visualize your perfect performance ( what Phelps and his coach called " playing the tape " ) 41 . End each practice with a REWARD ( remember the habit loop : trigger , action , reward ) 42 . How to be a better teacher : connect emotionally , do n't give long speeches , communicate precisely and concretely , make a scorecard , maximize struggling , teach them to learn without you 43 . RINSE &amp; REPEAT . Rinse &amp; repeat . Rinse &amp; repeat 44 . Fight the battle anew every day ( a frequent message in The War of Art ) 45 .

@@27099911 @799911/ <h> What I learned about running and maybe about life <p> Several months ago I decided to start running . <p> Several sources inspired me : Murakamis well-known dedication to running and completing marathons ( including an ultra-marathon in Hokkaido featured in his running memoir ) ; the book SPARK which describes the many physical and emotional benefits ; finally , a long-held desire to do a triathlon , of which running is probably my weakest link ( really , they 're all weak links ) . <p> But the strongest explanation is a simple one . One day I decided to get off my butt and start running , and to finally turn it into a habit . <p> At first , it was every other day for 30 minutes . Several months have passed ; I now run 4-5 times a week , for up to an hour each time . Its been a fun and tough and sweaty journey . The best part ? Running is a great metaphor for life . So I get to wax faux-philosophical on some lessons learned . Here they are : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did n't  start running because somebody asked me to become a runner . Just like I did n't  become a novelist because someone asked me to . One day , out of the blue , I wanted to write a novel . And one day , out of the blue , I started to run simply because I wanted to . I 've always done whatever I felt like doing in life . People may try to stop me , and convince me I 'm wrong , but I wont change . Haruki Murakami <p> To quote a friend , people who love running learn to love pain . I 'm pain-sensitive . Yes I 'm basically a wuss . That 's been a barrier , I 'm sure , to building the running habit , since if I 've learned anything its that running is entirely an exercise in enduring pain . <p> Something helped me break the barrier : I stopped comparing myself to other runners . Before , those who passed me would piss me off . Running with friends was a constant mental exercise in determining who was suffering more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely rid of them , but I 've been better , much better , about just getting going and doing my own thing . <p> Human beings are the most adaptable species on the planet . Our bodies are ground-zero . That 's why one person can eat 12K Big Macs in 30 years , and another can take 40K ecstasy pills in nine . Over time , I 've noticed that my body ( or some combination of mind-body ) learned to quiet the pain . I still feel it , from the first step to the last , but its weaker , quieter , like an inner beast who 's hoarse from all the roaring . <p> Choosing the harder choice <p> If you have two choices , choose the harder . If you 're trying to decide whether to go out running or sit home and watch TV , go running . Probably the reason this trick works so well is that when you have two choices and one is harder , the only reason you 're even considering the other is laziness . Paul Graham <p> Its the sort of wisdom that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet , but running has helped . 95% of the time , I do n't  want to run , but 100% of the time , I 'm glad I did . <p> Running is the harder choice compared to just about anything else I could do . Because if there is something harder ( say , making a painful phone call , or writing a long blog post ) , I can always take an hour to run and feel better before I do that harder thing . And most things ( say , streaming Netflix , or microwaving a Pizza Pocket ) are easier . <p> The hard-ness or easy-ness of doing something is tied to the pain . Just like your body learns to quiet pain over time , you learn to defeat laziness as well . Like in a role-playing game , you earn experience points and level-up and pretty soon the previously strong enemies of sloth and apathy are easily beaten . <p> Life is good . Because habits <p> Habits , habits , habits . They are everything . I cant talk about habits without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life lessons , you can overdo it . A little spice is good for a dish ; a little habit is great for a meaningful life . <p> Its a balancing act between repetition and revision . At least once a week , I 'll run wind sprints instead of the usual jog . Sometimes I 'll drive to the beach and run along the pier . Or I 'll go to the campus stadium and run the stairs . That act never ends ; we only achieve true equilibrium when were dead ( one of the few things I remember from AP Biology ) . <p> Sacrifice leads to satisfaction <p> The only thing that will make you happy is to set a goal , then kill yourself to achieve it . I have a theory that the elation you feel is directly proportional to the sacrifices you make . Dr. Nicholas of Broadcom <p> Most of my lifes most satisfying moments have been the cumulation of years of sacrifice ( for example , getting into a good college , finding a respected job , launching a company ) . And most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods of extended indulgence ( to me , the opposite of sacrifice ) . Everyone needs the occasional Vegas weekend , but aside from a few photos and funny stories , that happy feeling disappears on the flight home . <p> For simpler , more mechanical things like running , its even more reliable , both in your mind ( " I finished something " ) and body ( " These endorphins are delicious " ) . <p> These are my rambles , for now . I prefer bending the rules to serve my needs . Its a source of regret and reckoning . But with running , I 've had to bend myself instead . Or in Murakamis words : <p> I think certain types of processes do n't  allow for any variation . If you have to be part of that process , all you can do is transform or perhaps distort yourself through that persistent repetition , and make that process a part of your own personality .

Winning does not tempt that man . This is how he grows : by being defeated , decisively , by constantly greater beings . <p> Alain de Botton said something like , we are already far better read than the great Greek philosophers of old , yet we are still think were not well-read enough .

Half an hour would be plenty : just ask her about herself , tell her about myself , and what I 'd really like to do explain to her the complexities of fate that have led to our passing each other on a side street in Harajuku on a beautiful April morning in 1981 . This was something sure to be crammed full of warm secrets , like an antique clock built when peace filled the world . <p> After talking , we 'd have lunch somewhere , maybe see a Woody Allen movie , stop by a hotel bar for cocktails .

I 'm not carrying any laundry , for one thing . Whos going to buy a line like that ? <p> Maybe the simple truth would do . " Good morning . You are the 100% perfect girl for me . " <p> No , she would n't believe it . Or even if she did , she might not want to talk to me . Sorry , she could say , I might be the 100% perfect girl for you , but you 're not the 100% boy for me .

The envelope could contain every secret shes ever had . <p> I take a few more strides and turn : Shes lost in the crowd . <p> Now , of course , I know exactly what I should have said to her . It would have been a long speech , though , far too long for me to have delivered it properly . The ideas I come up with are never very practical . <p> Oh , well .

If we really are each others 100% perfect lovers , then sometime , somewhere , we will meet again without fail . And when that happens , and we know that we are the 100% perfect ones , well marry then and there . What do you think ? " <p> " Yes , " she said , " that is exactly what we should do .

They passed each other in the very center of the street . The faintest gleam of their lost memories glimmered for the briefest moment in their hearts . Each felt a rumbling in their chest . And they knew : <p> She is the 100% perfect girl for me . <p> He is the 100% perfect boy for me . <p> But the glow of their memories was far too weak , and their thoughts no longer had the clarity of fourteen years earlier .

So let me explain how I got into them , why they 're so great , and which shows are my favorites . <p> How I got into podcasts <p> I 've always enjoyed audiobooks . Audible is expensive but I 've never regretted a purchase . <p> Like an Economist subscription or a Skritter membership , the price you pay pales in comparison to the value of what you learn .

Like Spotify is doing for musicians and Kindle Direct Publishing is doing for authors , podcast creators ( ranging from educators to comedians to entrepreneurs ) can now reach a large audience and make enough money to support themselves . <p> Listening to podcasts used to be a hassle . I would search the internet haystack , find the mp3 needle , load it into iTunes , and sync it with my iPhone , all before I listened to a single second . <p> I 'd often remember the podcast was in my phone after the fact , then mentally flog myself for spending half an hour driving in the car , listening to Selena Gomez or some mindless EDM crap , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Stitcher app removed all that hassle and made me into a podcast fanboy .

Now I automatically open the Podcasts app when my ears have 5+ minutes to spare , like when I lift weights , or drive somewhere , or do laundry . Its probably saved my life , because podcasts keep me awake when I 'm driving home at 2am after carousing with friends .

Its also why in elementary school I was named the " person who always had a book in his hand " . You can tell I was quite the popular 3rd grader .

Even though I finished 4 books , the bulk of the reading was done in January . <p> I finished : <p> Mastery by Robert Greene Amazon . Came highly recommended by Tim Ferriss , and I 'm a big fan of Greenes 48 laws of power . While I do n't  find Greene to be the most entertaining or efficient writer , he makes a strong case for the importance of becoming " the best " at something , and the steps necessary to get there ( including picking the right field , tons of hard work over a long period of time , finding the right mentor(s) to guide your development ) . Examples range from Mozart to Darwin to Paul Graham . <p> The Talent Code by Daniel Coyle Amazon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read through this one the fastest and its lessons will probably stick with me the longest .

Some overlapping themes with Mastery . Its a bit handwave-y at times , and not without its share of " hindsight is 20/20 " , but Coyle is a great writer and his research is both thorough and accessible . <p> The Big Miss : My Years Coaching Tiger Woods by Hank Haney Amazon . While in some ways , Im disappointed that someone whom Tiger trusted so closely was willing to write an expose of sorts , I 'm fascinated by elite performers and this is the closest anyone has come to understanding and then sharing insights about one of the worlds most private athletes ( minus that one bizarre scandal , of course ) .

@@27099986 @799986/ <h> What I Talk About When I Talk About Murakami <p> I love Murakamis writing , everything from his simple short stories to his hauntingly thoughtful novels . <p> I 'm a big believer in reading as a mirror to your own life . You love the authors you love because in many ways , they reflect who you are or who you want to be . It could be their portrayal of a specific character ; it could be their writing style and how it feels so sympatico to your own . Its a deeply personal experience and when it clicks , it clicks . Murakami just clicks for me . <p> Anyhow as I 'm reading What I Talk AboutI found myself reflexively ( what do you call it when you do something and do n't  even notice you 're doing it ? ) highlighting quotes like mad . I want to share some of my favorites with you . <p> On being alone : <p> It might be a little silly for someone getting to be my age to put this into words , but I just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of person who likes to be by himself . To put a finer point on it , I 'm the type of person who does n't  find it painful to be alone . I find spending an hour or two every day running alone , not speaking to anyone , as well as four or five hours alone at my desk , to be neither difficult nor boring . I 've had this tendency ever since I was young , when , given a choice , I much preferred reading books on my own or concentrating on listening to music over being with someone else . I could always think of things to do by myself . <p> On growing up : <p> At any rate , that 's how I started running . Thirty-three that 's how old I was then . Still young enough , although no longer a young man . The age that Jesus Christ died . The age that Scott Fitzgerald started to go downhill . That age may be a kind of crossroads in life . That was the age when I began my life as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real , starting point as a novelist . <p> On being himself : <p> What I mean is , I did n't  start running because somebody asked me to become a runner . Just like I did n't  become a novelist because someone asked me to . One day , out of the blue , I wanted to write a novel . And one day , out of the blue , I started to run simply because I wanted to . I 've always done whatever I felt like doing in life . People may try to stop me , and convince me I 'm wrong , but I wont change . <p> On persistence : <p> I think certain types of processes do n't  allow for any variation . If you have to be part of that process , all you can do is transform or perhaps distort yourself through that persistent repetition , and make that process a part of your own personality . <p> On prioritizing : <p> Im struck by how , except when you 're young , you really need to prioritize in life , figuring out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Finally , on writing ( I love the fugu analogy ) : <p> Basically I agree with the view that writing novels is an unhealthy type of work . When we set off to write a novel , when we use writing to create a story , like it or not a kind of toxin that lies deep down in all humanity rises to the surface . All writers have to come face-to-face with this toxin and , aware of the danger involved , discover a way to deal with it , because otherwise no creative activity in the real sense can take place . ( Please excuse the strange analogy : with a fugu fish , the tastiest part is the portion near the poison this might be something similar to what I 'm getting at . ) <p> What is your favorite Murakami book or story ? <p> 86148 @qwx286148 
@@27099987 @799987/ <h> Why does " touchstone " mean what it does ? And other words <p> I 'm fascinated by the history of words and phrases that have more than just a literal meaning . Why does it " rain cats and dogs " ? How did " eavesdropping " come to mean listening furtively to other peoples conversations ? And is a touchstone an actual stone ? <p> A touchstone , as used in casual conversation , can mean two things : <p> A way to measure the quality of something , as in " His athletic success became a touchstone for future athletes at the school " <p> An essential part of something , as in " Nirvana was a touchstone of the grunge music scene in the 1990s " <p> Where does the word touchstone come from ? <p> According to that most wonderful of resources Wikipedia , a touchstone is an actual stone . More precisely , its a small stone tablet used to determine the quality of precious metals like gold and silver . When you use gold to draw a line on a touchstone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compared to streaks from gold pieces of known quality and composition . <p> Fascinating , right ? Although explaining why its popular today is much harder , like trying to explain why we use " what 's up ? " to greet people . Who knows , maybe some famous person decided to use it and it spread from there . <p> Now I 'll answer the first 2 questions with less precision . <p> In England several centuries ago , when it rained really hard , stray dogs and cats would drown and pile up in the gutters . Thus the phrase " its raining cats and dogs " . Makes you think twice about using that phrase , right ? <p> As for eavesdropping , there are several competing explanations , but old houses used to have eaves hanging from their roofs . Thus if you were right outside the window or door , secretly listening to the conversations inside , you 'd be beneath the eaves and thus eavesdropping . <p> What words or phrases can you explain ? I 'd love to hear . <p> 86148 @qwx286148

You understand your parents better as you get older still working on this one . It has n't  gotten much easier <p> 2 . Relationships are like cars rings increasingly true .

Take up surfing at 60 , learn a new language at 47 , start writing software at 35 <p> 6 . Make 5-year commitments the exact number of years is n't important , the long-term commitment is . Determine a priority , commit to it , and build a daily habit to support it . So for example if you want to become a good cook , its good to think about where youd like to be as a chef in 5 years . And then find a reason and routine to cook every day <p> 7 . It 's never too late " the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago , the second best time is today " <p> 8 . Conquer fear and you 'll be unstoppable Scott Adams : " When you see a successful person who lacks a college education , you 're usually looking at someone with an unusual lack of fear . " <p> 11 .

I re-wrote the following essays in my own words ; the exercise helps me explore writing styles , voices and phrasing . <p> Here it is ! A re-write of Samuel Johnson on Sleep , no. 32 in " The Idler " . <p> <p> People rarely think deeply about common activities . They confuse familiarity with knowledge , thinking they understand such things because they are used to them . But the thinking man looks deeper , knowing that the more he learns the less he understands . <p> Take , for example , sleep . A great part of our lives are spent sleeping . Every animal sleeps ; some philosophers think vegetables sleep , too . Yet with something this important , we do n't know the cause , we cant explain how falling asleep works and were unsure what precise benefits we receive from rest . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleep affects us all , the loud and the timid , the industrious and the lazy , the happy and the melancholy .

Whether he found it useful or not , to him it was a sign of human weakness : a body that needs sleep so regularly , yet dies so quickly . <p> No matter what emotional state we are in , no matter how passionate and absorbed we are , we eagerly await sleep . We will always retreat to sleep , casting aside a day good or bad , removing our senses and disabling our mental faculties . <p> Why then are we so greedy , ambitious and jealous ?

Daydreams , musings and idle thoughts disappear as quickly as they come , and soon the day is gone . <p> For some , their happiest moments are spent in solitary reflections , lost in their imagination , dreaming of untold riches and incomparable power , fancying a fascinating and luxurious life . For others , solitude is frightening , and they retreat to constant companionship . But the difference is slight ; in solitude we wrap ourselves in our dreams , and in socializing we share them .

You really wonder how deeply and broadly the effect goes . Here in Buenos Aires , its so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total sense I can barely think about moving with the overbearing sun , the heavy humidity , how every location feels so much farther than it looks . <p> Boy is it nice to walk around in a tank top , shorts , and flip flops .

It felt more like a declining metropolis than a high-culture hub ( complete with its lack of deep cultural sites , top tier museums , etc ) .

@@27100106 @800106/ <h> Tag : shopkick <p> ( the below is part 4 of my ramblings about overachieving , jobs , and- startups. here are parts 1 , 2 , and 3sorry that its so fragmented. - ill- merge- them into one longg- essay when finished ) <p> San Francisco and startups <p> How to describe San Francisco . I came to the city expecting New York lite , a small juicy apple instead of the big , ripe one . But the reality of SF was nothing like New York . Instead of an apple , it was more like a tangerine . Cute , fragile , and just a little bit sour . <p> The next three years , in a paragraph : my girlfriend and I created- a loyalty card for local restaurants . You visit one of our member restaurants , get deals and discounts to keep you coming back . We broke up a few months later ( a story for another time ) . The loyalty program sputtered and sank . Eager to move on , I then built a recruiting website to describe- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was- still- fresh in my mind . A friend had built something similar- for investment banking , and it was making money . Start what you know , right . That 's why young entrepreneurs instinctively fall back on tutoring businesses and SAT prep companies . <p> Slowly , steadily , the recruiting website Management Consulted began to attract an audience . People paid me to edit their resumes and give them mock case interviews . I wrote and sold a recruiting ebook on the site , which described the consulting job search in detail . I worked on the site for nearly a year , full-time , alone. - The loneliness got to me . As did the slow growth in users and revenues . In baseball speak , the business felt like a bunt single . What I did n't know then is that all good companies begin as bunt singles . You just have to get to base . And once you 're on base , you have to be patient . Patient and persistent . As John Rockefeller says , there is- no- other quality so essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But I did n't  persevere . In search of a faster vehicle- that would take me to some poorly defined but conceptually glorious- destination , I joined a proper Silicon Valley startup : shopkick . It was a real startup- in every sense of the term : Techcrunch buzz ( back when Techcrunch mattered ) , famous investors , experienced founders , big- visions- to- disrupt big entrenched- industries . The founder was a serial entrepreneur and fellow McKinsey alumni . How to describe him . You knew instantly he was the sort of person who would summit whatever mountain he chose to climb . But , importantly , he would n't trample or push aside other climbers along the way . He made the decision easy. - Management Consulted was put aside , allowed to operate passively . <p> At shopkick , I helped to conceive and launch iPhone shopping apps . Because I was among- the first five people to join the team , I was a de facto member of the inner circle , given a voice in big decisions and cc-ed on important emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to bigger offices . More experienced people were hired. - And slowly , a- kind of osmosis happened . Slowly , through diffusion , - I was- pushed out of that core- circle . I found myself- outside of the leadership membrane to become just another hard working contributor . The founders had good reasons , I 'm sure . But in my arrogance and frustration I again chose the quick fix : I left . <p> Two tailwinds shooed- me out the door . First , - I 'd seen up close how Silicon Valley tech sausage was made . It put an irrational confidence into me that I could do the same . Its not- THAT hard , I thought . And second , the Management Consulted website had not only survived my absence , but had grown in readers and book sales . It- was my- financial safety net and employer of last resort . <p> Upon leaving shopkick , I- joined Stanford 's student-run incubator . In the months that followed , I came to- the- following realization : if Management Consulted could make almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - how many such niches existed ? Could we build- 100s of- Management Consulteds ? <p> That 's how Hyperink began . <p> When I reflect- on those early SF years , I seem to remember only the disappointments . Like the loyalty card . The failed- relationship . Even Management Consulted felt like an underachiever , - because it was n't a proper Silicon Valley startup . Proper startups have cofounders . They work on hard technology problems . And they raise money . But MC was a one-man operation . Its- value- came from text- content . And I did n't know any investors nor did I think they 'd care . <p> The string of disappointments ended- when I joined shopkick . It- felt like- an- unconditional win . For the first time in two years , I again had the safety of an office space , and the structure and reliability- of weekly meetings , and that- sweet external validation coming from- famous investors , brand-name partners , and Stanford GSB students seeking- jobs . But- far and away what felt best about joining shopkick was the- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that delicious- infusion of capital . Next month 's rent money was safe . <p> The Silicon Valley startup thing- seemed like- the best of two worlds : the pay and prestige of a big company job , and the freedom and excitement of entrepreneurship . If my membership to shopkicks inner circle had n't been revoked , who knows how long I would have stayed ? <p> Hyperink <p> But everything happens for a reason . This I staunchly believe . And when I stumbled upon the idea to build scores of Management Consulted clones , it seemed fate was calling . Shopkicks door may have closed , but a new door had opened and a light was- pouring through . <p> Entrepreneurs often compare the emotional experience of starting a company to riding a rollercoaster . The similarities are obvious : the same- slow and tortured climb up , the same exhilarating ride down , its- sharp twists and turns , those- pumps of adrenaline . Like most analogies it must- leave out the mundane and nagging details : the- two hours spent waiting in line under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for admission and $5 for soda and $6 for hot dogs . All for a ride that ends before you can savor the journey . <p> Hyperinks roller coaster ride began when we were accepted into Y Combinator . It was a pleasant surprise to be accepted . I had assumed YC was out of reach , given my minimal programming skills and lack of connections- to- their- community . But the idea for Hyperink came two weeks before YC 's application deadline . That- timing- seemed- both fortuitous and fated . It could n't hurt to apply , I thought , and at worst the application would help me think through- the tough- questions . <p> PG writes , If you want to make ambitious people waste their time on errands , the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige . Ironically , it was YC 's very prestige that persuaded- me to apply . YC- was- the Valleys- most selective incubator , with the most successful alumni , Airbnb and Dropbox and reddit and many others nipping at their heels . Membership into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Stanford stamp during my corporate job search . And its- prestige has only grown with time , right alongside its ambitions . <p> The twelve week program- had the fervor of a religious revival , the youthful optimism of summer camp , and the terse- wisdom of military bootcamp . Twelve manic- weeks to build- your- startup alongside thirty equally hungry , equally relentless- teams . It was a roller coaster where the drops were punctuated only by the briefest of pauses . When the program ended , we presented at Demo Day , then quickly raised $1M-plus from investors who only- months before had been names I recognized- from tech blogs and VC websites . Like ballroom dancing , startup fundraising is all about timing . And it was a great- time to raise money . The Valley whole was red hot , and YC was its- shiny new factory for building rockets to the moon . Every investor wanted a ride . <p> Our intent was to raise $300-500K , enough money to hire a small team and spend one or two years trying to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500K threshold , such a self-imposed ceiling seemed silly . There were many concrete reasons to say yes to more money : money gave us more time , more people , more options , and of course more respect . The reasons to say no were vague by comparison , the most cited one being my cofounders desire to stay lean and focused . He was wiser than me . <p> The total amount came to just under- $1.4 million . It- felt really damned good . From idea to YC acceptance to a- seven-digit business checking- account , seven months had passed . A seven month orgy of productivity and efficiency and plaudits . As an overachiever , this is what you dream of . And the roller coaster was only gaining speed . <p> With the money , we hired our first employees . We leased an office space in Soma , which is to SF entrepreneurs- what FiDi is to- New York- bankers.We bought Ikea furniture and lots of Apple products. - We got a wave of positive coverage in the tech press . We held a- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement and a vision statement . We were , truly and goodly and finally , our own Silicon Valley startup . <p> Of course , the ride- had its tough spots . As Marc Andreessen says , the two hardest things you 'll have to do when running a company are recruiting and talking people out of leaving . And most of the early stresses came from- recruitment and management . It was disheartening to hire someone and watch them struggle . And no less- disheartening when an employee you liked and thought valuable wanted to quit . But in- running a startup , there is no such thing as equilibrium . Only adjustments . <p> The one thing that never wavered during this euphoric chaos- was my confidence . It 's an odd thing , confidence . When you 're confident , youre- wearing- a suit of armor that only others can see . An- inverse- of the emperor has no clothes . People react to it . People are swayed- by it. - But- because you cant see it on yourself , - you do n't  think twice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does. - The- protective steel- is- a part of you , in every interaction , every decision , every step forward . But one day , youll- notice that somebody else is wearing their own suit of armor . And- on that day , you 'll finally realize- what it is , what it does . Unfortunately , that 's also the day when- you 've started to lose your own . <p> Ok , forgive me for the overwrought- analogy . But I wanted to give some sense of how confidence operated on me . At that time , I was so sure Hyperink would win whatever race we were racing , so certain to the absolute depths of my 27-year old soul , that I went all-in with my time , energy , and reputation . I was willing to gamble everything . Nothing else mattered . All of the skills that made me an effective young overachiever the discipline , the- willingness to sacrifice , the denial of pain- were- honed- in preparation for this , the real thing in the real world as an adult . What would a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . But it also meant respect and admiration in forever- form . No more striving , no more needing to please , no more doubt . It would settle the matter once and for all . <p> That victory- mattered more than happiness . It mattered more than health . And sometimes I even feared it mattered more than friends and family . During this period , my- mom and aunt came to visit San Francisco for two weeks . I made no time for them , only agreed to Saturday lunch at a restaurant two blocks from Hyperinks office . My mom is patient to a fault with me , maybe to her own detriment . But she lodged no- complaint , voiced- no criticism . <p> At least- the company- seemed to be doing- well . If religion is the opiate of the masses , then capital is the opiate of the entrepreneur . Money has a way of making everything seem okay . We were spending it to publish books , to build our marketplace , to strike partnerships , to grow the team . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was an optical illusion . We were- simply spending money to make less money . Like using water to make ice- while spilling much of it along the way . <p> And just as opium wears out and leaves its user with insomnia and anxiety , the money ran out , to be replaced by doubt and confusion . That 's when we began to pivot . And pivot and pivot . In pursuit of that coveted 10% weekly growth , we changed product directions again and again . Each shift brought a temporary surge of excitement that just as quickly faded when user numbers did n't  budge . $1M does n't last long , not in SF , not with a now 12-person team . We tried to raise a Series A. Investors sniffed but did n't bite . The failure did n't surprise me , but it hurt nonetheless . My confidence was by then an overinflated balloon , ready to burst at the weakest poke . And even a vague rebuff or polite rejection felt like a sharp jab . The fragility was n't physical in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night , exercised several times a week . And it was n't mental fatigue , at least not in the cognitive , **29;171;TOOLONG sense . It was something deeper , more mysterious , like a grinding down and wearing out of the emotional soul . <p> I was chagrined at the company we 'd built . A publisher of ebooks , our books were neither engaging nor useful . On the content quality spectrum , we sat somewhere between Huffington Post and eHow . I was embarrassed and wanted to distance myself from it , because I did n't know how to fix it . Perhaps its like raising a child who becomes the kind of person that you secretly dislike . You 're ashamed of him , but really you 're just ashamed of yourself . After all , he s your son . You 're stuck . Of course , this is a horrible thing to say . I am only trying to get close to the truth . <p> Many of the mistakes we made have the clarity afforded by hindsight . Such as : we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had built something users wanted . We did n't build something users wanted . We worked hard , but we were n't patient . But above all , we gave up . Or more pointedly , I gave up and persuaded others to do the same . I ignored Rockefeller 's advice . <p> Our bank account was low . The team was tired . There were no exciting potential pivots . So when investors said no to a Series A , I saw a way out , and I took it . History does n't repeat itself but it rhymes , right ? Hyperink 's final dissolution would take another year , to let go of the team , to wind down partnerships , to notify investors . By mid-2013 , the Hyperink ride was finished . And for the first time since middle school , I did n't  immediately jump aboard another roller coaster , find another ladder to climb . I was sick of it . The future was a big , blank canvas , and I was in no hurry to fill it in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series , thanks everyone for your comments and emails ! <p> 86148 @qwx286148

Race to beat everyone for the 20K or so spots at the countrys top schools . And by top schools , I pretty much mean the Ivy Leagues plus a few .

That 's the ultimate test how can you keep your habits up when its hard to do so ?

In an attempt to push myself to get there , I 'll sometimes schedule calls at 7am or 6:30am .

So too is it , then , in the case of temperance and courage and the other virtues . Aristotle <p> The academic term for too much of a good thing is " nonmonotonic inverted-U-shaped effects " <p> Psychology research has proven that certain behaviors increase happiness ( eg , sending thank-you messages , spending money on others , making choices to increase autonomy ) , but GS believe there needs to be more discussion and research on the downsides of excess <p> Aristotle argued people need to find the mean , the " proportionate " response to things <p> Cited studies and examples include : <p> Learning ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on learning can divert attention from performance , waste resources , distract from key priorities <p> Complex jobs provide satisfaction and fulfillment , but jobs that are too complex ( I 'm thinking anything in public office these days ) can lead to stress , burnout , dissatisfaction <p> An NBA study showed that practice was helpful and improved performance , but excessive practice ( and excessive experience , as measured in years ) led to overconfidence , complacency , and lack of creativity <p> Detail-orientation is important to success , but when you are too detail-oriented especially for simple , mechanical jobs , you can miss the bigger picture <p> Generosity is good , but too much consumes your time and energy . A study of volunteers showed that 100 to 800 hours per year is optimal <p> Other examples of the inverted-U include optimism ( too much can lead to under preparation and under estimation of risks ) , self-esteem ( can harm relationships and health ) , cheerfulness ( can lead to engaging in risky behaviors ) , and life satisfaction ( " moderately satisfied " people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less and had lower levels of education ) <p> GS stress that most data are correlational , and thus causality is uncertain .

I struggled through this part , but here 's my best shot : <p> One reason is " virtue conflicts " . In other words , life is zero-sum , and the more of one virtue you cultivate , the less time and energy you spend on other virtues ( helping others is good , but so is investing in yourself ) <p> The second reason is " good things satiate and bad things escalate " .

@@27100137 @800137/ <h> The Religion of Business ( starting a new site ) <p> I 'm launching a new site called The Religion of Business . It will describe what businesses can learn from a close study of organized religions . <p> Religion is a topic that , over the years , Ive become very excited to study . This fall I 'll be taking religious studies classes , and depending on how they go , I may pursue a Masters and/or PhD . As I learned more about organized religions and religious thought , I realized there were many parallels between " big business " and " big religion " : their operations , philosophies , goals , histories . Given my business background in consulting , technology , and entrepreneurship , it seemed like a logical overlap . <p> I prefer to launch early and iterate often . This can result in stillborn efforts , but its a method that works for me . As a result , I cant predict what the new website will become . For starters , its where I 'll publish my writings about the intersection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case studies , and book reviews ( for example , I 'm currently reading Darwins Cathedral by David Sloan Wilson ) . <p> My goal is to create a body of useful , specific , actionable knowledge for decision-makers at businesses ( ie , corporations ) that draws from the extensive insights of organized religions ( eg , Zen Buddhism , Judaism , Catholicism , and so forth ) . The very concept of religion as a business can be uncomfortable for many . So I expect that studying organized religion , and where it intersects with modern business , will be at times a controversial pursuit . I 'll do my best to be respectful of peoples religious beliefs . My goal is not to promote or favor a specific religion or school of thought , except where its applicable to helping a business succeed . This will be an adventure , and I look forward to sharing it with you , and hearing from you . Thanks ! <p> Kevin <p> 86148 @qwx286148 
@@27100139 @800139/ <h> Tag : one hour <p> This was my best week yet ( do n't  worry , I do n't  sustain this pace . March 14-20 is much worse ) <p> Im reminded again of the need to spend at least one hour on an activity if you want to improve your performance and create a habit <p> The daily checklist has improved my performance . Probably common senseit ups the stakes , it becomes a public commitment , and a continual reminder . Yes , maintaining the checklist takes time and effort and can feel a hassle , but so far has been worth the investment <p> Each of my habits has one reliable trigger . When I fail to setup the trigger , the habit usually fails . For example , my singing trigger is to take a singing lesson . Seems obvious but is quite effective . When I take a lesson that week , I practice a lot more ( before and after the lesson ) . With writing , my trigger is a quiet morning . I also must start to write before working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that calm morning environment and begin writing , I can almost always write for an hour . For challenging habits , I need to identify these triggers . For example , how do I reliably wake before 8am ? ? Struggling with that one ! <p> My day is divided , roughly , into one hour chunks . This was the case when I did tech startups and its the case today , as I pursue a mix of writing and music and habits . <p> With tech startups , the hour was standard because most meetings were an hour and because at least 1/3 of the day was meetings . The rest of your day flowed from that structure . It was natural to think of tasks and responsibilities and schedules in those one hour chunks . <p> But now that I can create my own schedule , work is still divided into one hour periods . Writing gets an hour in the morning . So does singing . And on a good day I read for at least one hour . <p> Why is this one hour block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakthrough . In the beginning , I would schedule singing for thirty minutes . But when with distractions , a warm up , a bathroom break , etc , the thirty minutes would shrink to only ten or twelve minutes of real training . When I increased my commitment to one hour , the improvement was noticeable and immediate : in progress and engagement and excitement . The time doubled , but my subjective growth was probably greater . <p> And once I realized the value of investing one hour , of spending sixty minutes , I saw the same pattern elsewhere : in writing , in exercise , in most serious pursuits . It can be hard to find one hour in your day , and you probably should n't start with that much time . In fact too much time can be harmful . But , at least for me , one hour is necessary for meaningful and continued development . <p> One hour or bust . Just thinking out loud . Thanks for reading : ) <p> PS . Maybe there is a reason our calendar days are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty minutes , and a day have twenty four hours ? Maybe , just maybe , the many millennia of human history and the infinite loops of social trial and error have taught civilization that one hour consisting of sixty minutes is the optimal grouping for our most valued resource : time ! <p> 86148 @qwx286148

@@27100151 @800151/ <h> Tag : thomas hampson <p> So I 'm on a quest to improve my singing and make music . In addition to weekly vocal lessons , I 've spent tens of hours on YouTube listening to vocal coaches and following their exercises . <p> The benefit of having so many different sources of instruction is that you get multiple perspectives on the same topic , many answers to the same problem . In learning something as complex and always-changing as singing , sometimes one persons explanation will finally click and that 's all you need . <p> Of course , this comes with a big downside : lots and lots of conflicting advice . In particular anything related to breathing : the diaphragm , the solar plexus , breath support . What Ive learned is that ultimately , you find what works for you and you start from there . Anything that does n't  make you feel better is probably the wrong direction when it comes to singing . <p> Here are my favorite free YouTube voice coaches . My criteria are , roughly : theyve published a lot of videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they sing the exercises themselves , and they 're practical and not stuck on only one way to do things . <p> My first and still probably my favorite for his enthusiasm and humor and the high quality , focused exercises . He s published something close to 100 videos now , and they 're all well done . A few of my favorites include this video on breath control and this vocal warmup . <p> I watched at least ten of her videos before she even vaguely mentioned her singing resume , and its impressive . She was the principal backup for the SF production of Wicked ! Anyhow , that 's her persona : extremely humble , very talented , and very practical . Her use of everyday metaphors and visualizations can help any singer , particularly those who are stuck on a problem like lifting the soft palette . Some of my favorites include her 3 quick tips for better singing and her video on how to sing like a pop star ( embedded at the top ) . One of the most enjoyable , funny , and authentic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he really had to hustle and push to find success in the music world . And now that he has it , he appreciates the value of hard work , and of simply finding stuff that works , without unnecessary complication or BS . He s someone who can take the most complex voice concept and explain it in a way that anyone can understand , and he s also willing to be both innovative in his singing exercises and simple at the same time . Two valuable qualities . Some of my favorites include this exercise to release your jaw and this exercise for expanding your range . <p> Freyas relatively new on YouTube but she 's been publishing a lot of videos , and shell definitely push you with her exercises . She might have the best voice among these four ( best is VERY relative when it comes to voice ) . She also has a very no-nonsense attitude about singing . One of my favorites is this one on breath support . <p> Bonus : if you 're an opera or classical singing fan , you 'll love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about classical singing and I found myself enthralled with his teaching .

I 'm getting stuck around 60-70% . There are two reasons why . Only one is easy to fix . <p> Reason 1 : Usually , I start the week strong . On Monday , Tuesday , and Wednesday , I 'm doing very well . I wake up early , exercise , write , meditate , sing , and so on . By Thursday things start to slip , and this only worsens on Friday and then through the weekend . Perhaps my willpower is drained by being so checklist and task-oriented . But more importantly , I believe , the problem is socializing and drinking . As the weekday ends , I see my friends and we drink and party . I start to care less about work and " performance " .

Yet mentally , I treat them no differently . For example , one habit is a quick post-lunch nap . This seems to boost my afternoon energy and productivity , and I always enjoy them when I can make them happen . I end up tracking the habit and spending the time and energy and willpower to complete them , but do n't  share them here . The solution here is easier : just simplify the checklist and list all of the habits , or stop tracking them .

Then they saw it had no mast and their thoughts turned to a whale . But when it washed upon the beach , they removed the seaweed clumps , the jellyfish tentacles , and the fish remains . Only then did they see the drowned man . <p> They played with him all afternoon , burying him in the sand and digging him up again , until a woman saw the spectacle and spread the alarm in the village . The men who carried him to the nearest house noticed he weighed more than any man they had ever known , as much as a horse or a great shark , and they told each other that maybe he 'd been floating too long and the water had soaked into his bones . <p> When they laid him on the floor they said he was the tallest man they 'd carried because he barely fit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep growing after death was part of the nature of certain drowned men . He had the smell of the sea about him and only his shape hinted that it was a human corpse , because the skin was covered with a thick crust of mud and scales . <p> Without seeing his face , they knew that this dead man was a stranger . The village had only twenty or so wooden houses " each with its stone courtyards and overflowing vines " which spreadout out like a fan from where the river met the sea . So when they came upon the encrusted drowned man , they looked at each other and knew that none were missing . <p> That night the men did not work the sea . Some traveled to nearby villages to ask after missing people , and the women tended to his body . They removed the mud with grass swabs , they picked pebbles from his scalp , and with jagged tools used for cleaning fish they scraped the scales from his body . The women saw that the sea vegetation falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places and his clothes were filled with small vertical tears , as if he had floated through labyrinths of coral . They saw , too , that he faced death with a calm grace ; he did not have the frantic eyes or frightened grimace of other drowned men . But only when they had finished hours later did they see the man in his natural state and it left them breathless . Not only was he the biggest , strongest , most stately specimen to chance upon their village , but his presence left no room in their imagination . <p> There was no bed large enough nor table sturdy enough to use for a wake . The summer clothes of the village 's tallest man would not fit him , nor the shoes of the villager with the largest feet . Fascinated by his size and beauty , the women made him pants from a piece of sturdy sail and a shirt from a large tablecloth . As they sewed , sitting cross-legged in a circle and sneaking glances at the body , it seemed that the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as on that night . In their silent reverie they saw him , strolling and smiling in their village , living in the house with the widest doors , his tall ceiling beyond anyones reach , secured by the sturdiest floor . They imagined his bed , carved from the hull of a giant sailship , held together by iron bolts , with his wife the liveliest , loveliest woman . They could hear his booming voice , drawing fish out from the sea simply by speaking their names . And they could not help but compare him to their own husbands , and they knew that he could do more in one night than theirs could in a generation . So they let theirs go , believing them weak and cowardly . As they wandered through that desert of fantasy , the eldest woman , who looked upon him first with compassion , sighed before she spoke . <p> His name is Dante . ' <p> They looked at him , lying there on the now muddy floor , and they knew that it was true . Soon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence crushed their doubts and they were sure : he was Dante . These women who had made his clothes , combed his hair and shaved his face trembled with sorrow as they resigned themselves to dragging him along the ground . They understood then the burden his huge body bore in life and now in death . They saw him , forced to enter doors sideways , cracking his head on crossbeams , standing with hunched back and no room to stretch his legs or rest his arms . They could hear the lady of the house , looking for a sturdy chair and begging him , frightened and fascinated , sit here Dante , please , and he would instead crouch on the ground , lean against the wall , smiling , do n't bother miss , I can manage , his knees aching from having done the same thing many times , to avoid the embarrassment of breaking the chair , or overturning the table , and perhaps not knowing that the ones who smiled as they said do n't go , Dante , at least wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would whisper after , how nice , that handsome fool is gone and we can relax again . <p> As dawn approached , that very thought was on the women 's minds . So they covered his face with a linen handkerchief and so hidden he looked defeated , like the shrunken husbands of their secret reverie . One of the younger girls began weeping despite her best efforts . Soon the room was filled with sniffs which became wails and fed back on its own intensity as they poured tears for Dante , their poor , peaceful , obliging Dante . When the men returned with news that the drowned man was not from neighboring villages , the women felt a burst of jubilation amidst their tears . <p> Praise the Lord , ' they shouted , he 's ours ! ' <p> The men saw those red faces and glistening eyes and thought it frivolous . After a sleepless night of tense inquiries , they wanted to remove the newcomer and start afresh before the sun became unbearable . They improvised a stretcher and tied it together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the weight of the body until they reached the cliffs . They wanted to tie an anchor to him so that he would vanish into the deepest waves , and stray currents would not wash him back to shore . But the faster they moved , the more cunning the women became in their delays . One would fasten a rusted bracelet to his wrist , another would pin a threaded ribbon on his shirt , yet another would place charms in his pockets for good luck , and after much repeating of stop doing that , woman , keep away , look you almost made me trip on the dead man , the men began to feel an uneasiness in their stomachs and started grumbling about why so many baubles and decorations for a stranger , because no matter how much they blessed and warded him , the sharks would chew him all the same , but they kept piling on their old relics , shuffling to and fro , while they sighed and sniffled , so that the men finally erupted with why do all of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotting nobody , a piece of cold sea-soaked meat . An older woman , shocked at their casual attitude , removed the linen handkerchief from his face and the men were left breathless , too . <p> The men knew he was Dante . It was not necessary to say it yet again . There could only be one Dante and there he lay , arms akimbo , shoeless , wearing ill-fitting pants made of sail , and with gleaming trinkets that made him seem like a god of Incan myth . And from his face they knew that he was ashamed , that he could not deny the burden of being so big or heavy or handsome , and if he had foreseen this tortuous journey , he would have found a more discreet place to drown in , honest , I even would have tied that anchor around my neck and crawled my way off the cliff not to upset people with this piece of cold meat , as you people say . His manner was so genuine that even the most hardened men , the ones who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their women would stop dreaming about them and start dreaming of drowned strangers , even they and others who were harder still trembled in the chambers of their hearts at Dantes sincerity . <p> And that is the origin of the most lavish funeral a village of twenty or so wooden houses could manage for a solitary drowned man . The women who had gone to get flowers in neighboring villages returned with other women who could not believe the story , and those women hurried home for more flowers still when they saw him , and more and more flowers and people began to appear , neighbors of the neighbors and so on , all wanting to see for themselves . But when the funeral ended they could not bear to carry him to the waters as an orphan and so they chose a father and mother from the best family , and named aunts and uncles and cousins and nephews , so that all the inhabitants of the village became his kinsmen . <p> While they fought for the honor of bearing him on their shoulders along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the virginal emptiness of their streets , the dusty stones in their courtyards , the narrowness of their dreams as they absorbed the splendor of their drowned kin . They finally let him go without an anchor so he could return if he so desired , and as one they held their breath , the wind fluttering about and the sea 's crashing waves , as they imagined him floating into the abyss . They knew then that things must change , that their houses would need wider doors and higher ceilings and softer floors with sturdy chairs so that Dante 's memory could come and go without trouble and no one in the future would dare mutter the big handsome fool finally died , too bad , because they were going to paint their house fronts bright colors to make his memory eternal and they were going to labor hard in the unbearable sun digging springs and planting flowers on the cliffs so that in future years at sunrise the passengers on passing boats would awaken , and with drowsy eyes they would see the rows upon rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come down amidst all the chatter , would point to the village with its twenty or so wooden houses where the river met the sea and say , look there , see that village where the sun 's so bright the sunflowers do n't know which way to turn , yes , over there , that 's Dante 's village . <p> *** <p> The above is my remix of a beautiful short story by Gabriel Garcia Marques . here 's another example . <p> 86148 @qwx286148

Wake up before 8am there 's improvement , although it may not show in the score yet . Its all about going to bed early ( before 11pm is ideal , because it leaves an hour-plus for reading : ) <p> 2 . Make the bed automatic . I do n't  like to see a messy bed . I may remove this habit because its so reliable and does n't  need daily tracking <p> 3 . Journal almost automatic . I do n't  have a set time to do it , so on some days it will slip . May remove this one as well <p> 4 . Write hit or miss . Sometimes I feel the urge , like when starting a new essay or story , and oftentimes I do n't  <p> 5 .

Exercise pretty good . I 've built a streak of running days , just putting in the miels , and I can feel the continual improvement in form and fitness and the positive effects on other areas . Running , like other ( mentally or physically ) painful habits , is about momentum . Each successive day becomes easier , and each missed day makes the next one harder <p> 7 . Take a cold shower I 'm losing the cold shower religion ( ! ) . Partly because I 'm now in NYC and spring is taking a damn long time to get hereI may remove this habit for a few months and see what changes <p> 8 . Sing going well , as long as I continue taking lessons and recording myself I should be fine . For further motivation , I may start a Zhu-type project to release 52 songs in 52 weeks <p> 9 . Floss automatic . its part of the brushing routine <p> 10 .

@@27100200 @800200/ <h> August <p> I kept putting off reading this book , but after unabated nagging from a few friends , I took the plunge and got through it pretty quickly . Stross provides a great refresher of YC lessons learned , and his behind-the-scenes access unlocked plenty of new insights and stories . <p> Its nominally an investigation of how average tennis players like myself can perform at their highest level , but its lessons can be abstracted into a life philosophy on how to overcome obstacles , face competition , and be your best self . Some of Timothys lessons are trite and of the self-help variety , for example his belief that opponents are blessings in disguise , but overall I enjoyed reading the book and understanding the difference between my conscious and subconscious self . <p> You know you 're a big poo-bah when the title of your book can follow the format " your last name on some topic " .

For example , the best dialogue should be oblique , as in : <p> Harry : " Did you like that new movie Gravity ? " Sally : " How can you not like a movie with George Clooney AND Sandra Bullock ? " <p> The dialogue is oblique because Sally does n't  just say " Yes " or " No " . So yeah , many nuggets like that . <h> September <p> Yes , I read this book in middle school and I think its really meant for on-the-cusp adolescent boys . Where the re-reading urge came from , I cant tell you .

I find it amazing that an adult author can write something which touches both children and adults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Giver profoundly affected 12-year old me , and its probably changed the lives of millions of kids and will continue doing so . Powerful stuff . <p> As I 've mentioned too many times before , I love Murakamis writing . Like going on a run with a really fit friend , it pushes you beyond the limits of what you thought possible , and you 're left better for the experience with an undeniable readers high . <p> Not alls perfect in Murakami-land , though . His sometimes bizarre , usually unpredictable endings can be aggravating , because I like to have my literary is dotted and ts crossed . Those endings can feel like a girl who careens into your life , crashing through the emotional boundaries that youve carefully built , and then vanishes without a warning , leaving you with questions that your heart keeps asking but your brain knows will remain unanswered .

Dan Carlins Hardcore History ( in particular , his mind-blowing 5-part series on Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire ) 3. 60-Second Mind and 60-Second Health ( improve your life in 60 seconds ? I 'm there ! ) 4 . New York Times Book Review ( I skip the boring reviews ) 5 . This American Life ( there 's something about Ira Glasss voice and the way he tells stories ) <p> Occasionally , I 'll go through Loveline , This American Life , and Fresh Air with Terry Gross archives and download interesting episodes .

Check there for the latest , since there 's an 5% monthly turnover . <p> Pretty please ? <p> The worst part of podcasts is that if I hear something great , like this beautiful Jesus and MLK story , its difficult to clip that section , annotate it , and share it . Written text wins here . Can someone please solve this problem ? <p> Alrighty readers <p> I hope you give podcasts a shot , and if you do , try the Podcasts app or Stitcher .

@@27100229 @800229/ <h> Tag : college advice <p> My cousin started college last month and when I was spending time with her and family in Shanghai I could n't help but think back on my college years and what I loved and did n't  like so much and missed and reminisced . With 10 years of hindsight now I do n't  think I could have squeezed much more juice out of the orange that is college life . I do wish I 'd studied overseas , though . Perhaps I 'm making up for it , subconsciously and otherwise , by living in Asia now <p> So I wrote a few suggestions for her in an email and as I did , the words kept pouring out . College is just such a unique and unparalleled time in a persons life . here 's a slightly edited version of what I sent her ( I cant share EVERYTHING : P ) . <p> 1 . Do n't stress about your major right now , or really ever . It should be about #7 on your list of important things to worry about freshman year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be rushed . You can still do it sophomore year , junior year , even senior year ( your parents might not appreciate my saying this , however : ) . What 's more important : Pick the right PROFESSORS . People who love to teach and who students love ( youll know who those yodas are pretty quickly ) . Engage as deeply as you can with their material . Through that process , a major will emerge . Its like how you discovered that you enjoyed dance , or liked a boy . Good things have a gravity of their own . Another method to determine your major : Work backwards . Look at the alumni and upperclassmen who you envy and admire . Find out their majors . And copy them . Simple , but it works . <p> 2 . Its NEVER too late to change . If you at any point worry that you 're too " old " to change whether your extracurriculars , or your group of friends , or your major , or even your study habits you should step far far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one who is young ever thinks they 're going to be old . Ok , I stole that last sentence from somewhere . Look at me : I 'm 10 years out of college and still changing where I live , what I do , my attitude about life . And the scary but honest part ? Just about every person I know who is my age or older wants to change , each and every day . Some make the attempt , but most do n't  . Regret is what separates the two . <p> 3 . You should choose one or two extracurriculars that you LOVE and really invest deeply in them . This is a better approach than joining 10 groups , and then missing most of their meetings . The best fruits are born of commitment . Of course you can take your time to choose those extracurriculars , and try them all out buffet-style . In fact its better , I think , not to be too pre-professional or career oriented when choosing these groups . You have the rest of your life to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 4 . The friends you make freshman year in your dorm , in your classes , at the parties will probably become your closest and tightest friends through college and even beyond . That 's why reunions often have reunions by freshman year dorm , and not sophomore or senior year . Freshman year , you 're like a piece of gak , soft and gooey and easily shaped by and mixed into those around you . By senior year you 've become something more like a rubber ball , still bouncy ! , but with more shape and structure : ) Freshman year , you 're thrown together with these people , largely at random , like most occurrences in life , but everything works out . Really invest in these people and appreciate who you have around you . Even the ones you might not like because they 're messy or do n't  shower or never seem to pay for stuff . <p> 5 . For many , this will be their first extended experience without parental supervision . This is a great and terrible thing . Everyone will struggle without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some , however , do n't  . They wind up skipping classes and partying six days a week and subsisting on junk food and generally just crapping out . Some of them realize their mistakes by junior or senior year , and regret their decisions for a long time . Try not to become that kind of person . Its not even their fault , because taking ownership of your life is difficult . I 'm still learning how to do it today . You 'll learn to be responsible for your choices : from when you wake up , to what you eat for lunch , to how you balance classes and friends and extracurriculars and the million other options that college presents on a platter . Just remember that the person who 's truly accountable now is you : ) <p> 6 . Going greek is a good experience . Of course I 'm biased but it was an important part of my college years and my pledge brothers are among my closest friends today . People who criticize you for joining a fraternity / sorority are usually jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand greek life and rely on second hand rumors and simple stereotypes the same way someone watches Fox News and believes Muslims and Mexicans should be evicted from America . If you DO decide to pledge , what matters is who you join alongside . Its not about the sisters in the house , its not about any of the pageantry , its about those you stand beside who you will get to know better than just about anyone else you meet in college . <p> 7 . Everyone on campus is there to help you . Truly . Everyone wants you to succeed : from your roommate to your advisors to upperclassmen to admin to professors and alumni ( in fact , ESPECIALLY alumni ! ) . You just wo n't find a group of people more universally committed to your success . Never hesitate to seek help . You 'll consistently be amazed . I still am , whenever I bother to ask , that is : ) <p> 8 . A sense of loneliness and ennui hit me after freshman year Christmas Break . The first semester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-scheduled and overwhelmed that you do n't have time to reflect . But you return from the holidays , and you 've got a set of new and tougher classes . Maybe the weather 's gotten worse . From your time at home you realize how much you miss your childhood friends . The reality of four years in college begins to sink in . For some people this realization does n't occur until sophomore year . But everyone goes through a sort of lull . Do n't  get stuck in it . That 's what friends are there for . Lean on them . This is often when grades dip . Work harder . Be more committed . Call your mom more . Exercise . <p> 9 . There 's always some hot job or perfect company that everyone wants to work for . Especially at a good school . In my time it was Goldman Sachs and Bain and the like . Today maybe it 's Facebook or Google or a hot startup . My friends who got finance jobs in New York thought they were the shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous of other friends who became millionaires at 25 . And people who join Facebook today will probably see the same thing happen to them . Point is , there 's always another gold rush . You can never predict it . Trying to do so means changing who you are in a way that you 'll probably regret . <p> 10 . Instead of thinking , what do I want to do immediately after college ? , think instead : Where do I imagine myself when I 'm 30 ? Now , I realize 30 seems eternally far away , and it does n't  have to be 30 , it could be 26 or 28 . Point is , the exercise forces you to think at least two if not four steps after college . Each life decision that you make is like setting down a small stepping stone . And you can place the stepping stone wherever you like , but if you place them all in different directions , you 'll never get far . The farther out you can anticipate or plan or dream of , the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Finally finally : take time , step back , and enjoy the moments when you can . 4 years will fly by , believe it or not . Sometimes I would just walk around campus , lay on the grass , take a nap , watch the people around me , and soak in the moment . So many people desperately want to be in your place . Appreciate it and enjoy it for all its worth ! <p> 86148 @qwx286148

An opportunity is when you help because you 'll feel better and improve your reputation as a result , and this is more convincing to both . Wills Effective Altruism movement is based on this <p> 90/10 problem : 90% of r&amp;d funds are spent on 10% of humanitys problems . For example , Will mentions male pattern baldness as an example of a problem that attracts a lot of research dollars but it mostly affects a small , well-off minority , while new antiobiotics are n't  being invented because the profit motive is n't there <p> Will describes patents as " two wrongs trying to make a right " .

In case you missed part 1 : Russell on competition . <p> From Chapter 6 , on Envy : <p> Napoleon envied Caesar , who envied Alexander , who probably envied Hercules , who existed only in myth ! Success is never the cure for envy . Eliminate envy by enjoying what life brings you , by working hard , and by avoiding comparison with those you think more blessed than you . <p> Extreme modesty is itself a form of envy . Measured modesty is a virtue , but extreme modesty should n't be similarly regarded . An overly modest person needs reassurance to do things which they 're very capable of doing . <p> <p> Envy is closely related to competition . We do n't envy people we think are out of reach . During periods when the social hierarchy was fixed , the lower classes did n't  envy the upper classes because movement between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envy other beggars who have a warm spot to sleep for the night . <p> However , the current instability of social status , combined with democracy 's message that everyone is equal , has made envy accessible to all . Eventually we 'll arrive at a more just social system , but for now , the poor envy the rich , poor nations envy rich nations , women envy men , the chaste envy the promiscuous . <p> While envy can be productive and lead to justice between classes , nations , and even genders , the justice that results is the worst kind , the kind that hurts the fortunate , rather than helping the unfortunate . If you desire profound , positive societal change , you should root for reasons other than envy to be the driving force . <p> <p> Most envy which seems on the surface professional is actually sexual in nature . A man who loves his wife and kids will be much less envious of other men 's success and wealth .

These runners are people who do well , earn a decent income , people who could , if they chose , work less or work on something that truly excites them . But deviating from their existing path would be embarrassing , like deserting the army in the face of the enemy , though if you ask what is the greater good of their work , they 're unable to respond , or theyll articulate a phrase they heard on TV or read in a textbook . <p> <p> The main problem is greed .

For example , a scientist may be wealthy or poor , but her respect is not tied to her income . And no one would be surprised to find a famous artist in poverty ; in fact , poverty is an honor . But for the businesswoman , there is no success beyond the competitive struggle to get rich . <p> <p> But life 's primary aim can not be competition . Its too grim , too much about desire and tension , to create a life worth living for more than a few decades . Soon it produces nervous fatigue , a desire to escape and a need for pleasures as aggressive as the work itself . True relaxation becomes impossible .

Are you happy with the show ? <p> Screenwriters come in many sizes and types . <p> There are emotional writers , like Happiness and Passion , and Fear . Emotions write the way they feel : Happiness might suddenly dash off three fantastic pages , but then she gets bored and does n't finish the rest of the draft .

He wants the actors to look younger , fitter , to wear less , put on more makeup . Capitalism seems to only write small variations of the same storyline with the same stakes . Her characters always have reliable , respected jobs , and her plots revolve around money and how to make more of it . <p> Sometimes family and friends will invite themselves into the writers room . Usually unannounced , but never shy or tentative . They have strong opinions . Their input on the script is the same feedback they 've given a thousand times .

Its enough time to build momentum in a habit- and increase your- comfort and skill at- the- task . Its also not so long that it scares or- exhausts you . And if it- does n't  stick- or does n't  work or simply isnt fun , you can remove it . <p> And here are 10 of the- wishlist- habits that I 'd like to attempt in the future .

I 've noticed more sponsorships and ads in professionally produced podcasts ( eg , the BS Report , NPR Planet Money ) but advertising needs massive viewership for massive dollars . Subscription and pay-per-episode models are uncommon and mostly voluntary .
