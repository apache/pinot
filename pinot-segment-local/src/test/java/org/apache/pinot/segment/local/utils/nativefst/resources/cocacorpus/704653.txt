But to be honest on Tenebrae , sorry to say this , but the game he debuted on was notorious for not being well received . He had funny moments , but it was n't enough to make him popular at all , especially looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last two polls , and 9th on the 5th poll ) . <p> Repede and Rollo do n't talk , yet those two keep up their ranks on 1st and 2nd . Repede is a playable character , and hanging out with Yuri during his adventures , and Rollo does almost the same but does n't fight , but does what a Boss Cat does , gathering more followers whose names are the same of past Tales Characters . Rollo 's popularity exceeds too much in Japan . Not the same like Quickie , Noishe or Zapie . <p> AlexBrandt1986 <p> It 's alot more well received these days than it was when it first came out , I see plenty of people saying they greatly enjoyed it . From the beginning , I had enjoyed DotNW , and by the end of the story , it became my top favorite Tales title . I found it just as amazing as Symphonia , perhaps even more . Tenebrae had a huge connection to the story in DotNW , as he is one of Ratatosk 's Centurions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning , yet ended up being part of what helped change Ratatosk 's mind on exterminating all humans , elves and half-elves . He even had a connection to Mithos and his companions , since they had met with Ratatosk during their own adventures 4000 years prior . It is a far superior sequel to Xillia 2 in every way , in my honest opinion . Aside from the skits being some of the most hilarious next to Berseria 's , and Hearts R 's , the dungeons were some of the best thought out designs since Symphonia , you really had to work hard to solve the puzzles to get to through everything , current games have been lacking that , too . <p> Repede is at least useful , as he 's a playable party member , but Rollo being usable in some mini-quest hardly makes him worthwhile . I agree that his popularity is way more than it should be , him , and the Normin in Zestiria did n't grab me the way other past mascots have . Bienfu is what the mascots should be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique . As he travels with the party , and is often included in their random moments of silliness , as well as their serious moments , happy ones and sad ones . <p> Hayato <p> That was during the first release , but looking at it now , I can see the problems . There 's no problem liking the game Not everyone else . Everyone can enjoyed it , but it 's flawed , not just because of story , but because how it played . It 's easily one of the easiest Escort titles due to the fact that the gameplay is incredibly broken it is . <p> Tenebrae is n't bad character , he 's good , but like I said , he 's not enough it be popular to even reach the top 5 . Hell , Beinfu , the Normin 's , and even Mieu are on top . Japan 's preference <p> InfinityAge11 <p> Hah , the top 2 mascots are the ones that do n't talk .

@@50009885 @3509885/ <h> aka let 's bully Alisha some more episode <p> Episode #01 of Zestiria X finds itself still before the game story proper , but then reaches to the very start of the game . <p> Disclaimer : This review comes from someone who has played the game and will heavily compare it with that . If you have not played the game , this review will contain obvious game spoilers . This is also based on the- DAISUKI.net release . <p> I 'm watching you . <p> Episode 01 starts with Alisha finding a ruin for shelter . Before falling asleep by the entrance , she comments how this world seems to be beyond saving . From afar , a little Normin is watching her . <p> Later in the morning , Alisha ventures within the ruin and finds that it 's another mural for the Shepherd . The discovery of something related to the Shepherd does n't make her give even the tiniest smile , but her sense of wonder is still there . <p> This is actually really cute . <p> She inspects the mural while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Normin is following her and imitating her without her knowledge - Normins are seraphim , after all . She comments silently how her excerpt is nothing more than legend , but it seems the Normin wants to convince her otherwise . Not that she can see him , really . <p> How dare you think we are but legend ! <p> Suddenly , another calamity strikes . A swarm of insects make their way toward Alisha . They attack , but little Normin here uses his seraphic powers and shields her from their blow . As Alisha freaks out ( who would n't ? ) , and the little Normin tries his best to protect her from these creepy crawlies . We get a little more of little Normin 's display of might . <p> Why is this- world so hell bent on making Alisha 's life miserable ? <p> The Normin blows a hole into the wall . Alisha notices that there seems to be another room beyond it and breaks through the wall as well . She freaks out again when the insects start crawling up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aqueduct . <p> Now if only you were this useful in the game . <p> She falls straight down into what seems to be a pool at first , and she swims up for air at the first sight of light - only to find that she 's actually on the ceiling of the ruin . Because gravity , she falls down from the water and down onto the floor , losing consciousness for a bit . <p> Alisha wakes up to find the body of water indeed suspended to the ceiling , commenting that it must be something from the era of Asgard . <p> She makes it out of the ruin and into a patch of flowers with a waterfall by it . There , a big tree stands , and Alisha finds a small stone monument bearing the Shepherd 's crest . She mentions how it might be where the light falls on the Shepherd 's crest ... and conveniently , light does fall on it for a bit . Seemingly activated , it moves out from under the tree and toward the waterfall . It shines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making Alisha wonder if the legend might be true , after all . <p> SOREY NO <p> Here we have Sorey being scolded by his mom . <p> After all this Alisha , we 're finally face to face with Sorey and Mikleo . The two discover a ruin and are looking around outside of it , wondering why no one in the village knows of this ruin ( considering how NEAR it is to Elysia in-game , that 's saying a lot ) . The two discover one of their Gramps 's illusions and breaks it , and are about to enter the ruin only to be stopped by Gramps himself . Gramps explains that the place has been sealed long ago and that he wo n't allow the two to explore it . <p> Back at Sorey 's place , the two wonder why Gramps wo n't let them near the ruin . Sorey finds an excerpt in his copy of the Celestial Record which probably explains why - the place used to be the Celestial Capital where humans and seraphim lived in harmony - seraphim gave their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commend the one who put this into publication - the design is too intricate . <p> Mikleo points out that the ruin also was n't under Gramps 's " palanquin route " ( Whatever that means. - Apparently it 's a mistranslation on the subs - he means " blessed domain . " Thanks for pointing it out , @LightningKikib ! ) , so the two decide to go and explore it anyway despite his orders . They then do their signature BFF fist bump , which they made much more complicated than its game counterpart . <p> FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC <p> Back to Alisha , she 's still exploring within the ruin , this time in a place devoid of light . The darkness eventually gets to her and she gets a short panic attack , screaming into the darkness . Releasing all that tension calms her down a bit and she continues through the darkness . <p> Back to outside the ruin , Sorey lands at the ruin proper and discovers a mural for the Shepherd . He also discovers a ( fingerless ) glove that bears the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he can examine it further . He apparently got there before Mikleo could . <p> Those who 've watched the Dawn of the Shepherd OVA will notice that majority of this scene was pretty much copy-paste , specifically the art . Ca n't really blame ufotable , really - I mean , it was already good in Dawn , so no sense in redrawing the whole thing if it 'd be the exact same scene anyway. - The dialogue also sounds the same for most parts . <p> The two are interrupted by the sudden fall of lightning - Sorey immediately notices it as not normal . The anime shows us what the game did n't - Alisha is actually very near the two , near an exit , and notices the lightning . She runs toward it , only to be almost attacked by it , making her run back into the ruin . <p> NO . MERCY . EVERRRRRR ! ! ! <p> The lightning is made by Zenrus , aka Gramps . Kyme , a seraph , reports to him that someone 's disturbing- the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mikleo have n't returned yet. - He expresses his frustration with the two - it seems he knows they 're in the very ruins he just forbade them to go to . He instructs Kyme to just do nothing for now . <p> Back at the ruins , Alisha reaches a dead end in the shrine within . The monument there lights up and hits the ground she 's under with lightning - making it collapse . She falls down to the lower level and loses consciousness again . Gramps comments that he shows no mercy to anyone who enters his domain . <p> As a doctor , I can confidently say that Alisha should have sustained at least a facial fracture or a broken limb by now . But it 's anime , so whatever . <p> This is something I never really considered in the game at all , and something enlightening to see in the anime - this scene clearly depicts the lightning bolt after Sorey . Not even Mikleo , but Sorey himself. - Initially in the game , I thought the lightning outside were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being specific to anyone who just invaded the shrine after the two find Alisha - but no . It feels like Gramps actually set his power at that time to target any human it detects . <p> Remember that in the game , Gramps has the power to actually detect what invades his domain and around it - for instance , when Lunarre invaded , he knew it was a hellion . So who 's to say that he does n't know that who invaded was a human ? He now has his powers set to " attack the human who 's invaded my domain , " but then Sorey himself is a human - so it 's attacking him , too . The lightning does n't even aim for Mikleo - it really went after Sorey . <p> They removed the Sorey catches Mikleo scene before the two of them fall into the hole - something I 'm vehemently against since this is supposed to hold a parallel to something in the game 's very end . <p> So anyway , Mikleo falls as the ground below him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the shrine , and Mikleo casts Twin Flow to cushion Sorey 's fall . <p> Mikleo that is an actual attack you use that causes damage . I 'm not sure if it actually cushions anything . But hey , it 's water , so , *shrugs* . <p> Though the whole speculation may be wrong though since the lightning does n't continue to attack Sorey when they 're inside the shrine - or maybe Gramps already put his powers to a stop . We 'll never know . <p> The two look around a bit and are ecstatic to find an even bigger shrine inside . From afar , a level below them , Sorey notices a human unconscious - it 's Alisha . Sorey wants to help , and initially Mikleo does n't want to - they should n't get involved with humans . Eventually , he relents anyway but wonders how they 'll be able to get down . Sorey of course , has the solution . He grabs Mikleo and they swing down to the lower level . <p> ufotable did you just ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Despite being down that level , Mikleo remarks there 's no point since they still have to cross the wide gap to get to her . Sorey points out that there 's dirt floating between that gap . Mikleo understands right away and casts a spell on the area , showing the form of a bridge . As the two cross it to the other side , they remark how no ordinary humans could have made this ( initially ) invisible bridge , so it must be from the Asgard era - similar to the water on the ceiling thing Alisha found earlier . <p> The anime is really showing that despite his dorkiness , Sorey is actually quite sharp when it comes to the obscure - as long as it has anything to do with ruins , that is . <p> They reach Alisha and Sorey wakes her up . She actually seems less wary of Sorey here than she did in the game here . After getting to her feet and getting Sorey 's name , Alisha blurts out , asking Sorey if he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at her and her sudden question . <p> I actually find that last scene to be somewhat heartbreaking - the anime has so far shown us a side that we do n't see of Alisha in the game . To be honest , in the game , I thought she just went away from Ladylake to deliberately look for the Shepherd - but no , she went through so much more horrible things . <p> She just lost all her close knight friends- and- an entire village . She has seen a young girl pretty much die right in front of her . She saw what seemed like a dragon going toward her ( and we still do n't know how she got out of that , exactly ) as she hung on for dear life. - She was pretty much attacked by a swarm of killer roaches . Not so serious as the previous ones , but she fell down from a body of suspended water and onto the cold hard ground of a ruin . Earlier , she was just lost in a room filled with darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She then got attacked by Gramps 's magical lightning and fell another story down onto the cold hard ground - this girl has gone through hell in a span of ... what , a day or two ? She is panicked , she is scared , she is distressed , she is desperate - so the first thing she asks , after going through what seemed to be a ruin that the Shepherd 's crest led her to , is whether or not this gentle soul right before her could be the Shepherd - the very person that could probably save her from the hell she 's experiencing right now ... and possibly the world that 's falling into chaos . <p> Of course , we all know Sorey is n't the Shepherd . At least , not yet . <p> I think my only qualm with this episode was that they kept playing- Mountain Ruins Overflowing with Passion for History so loud . I mean , I know they 're trying to show how majestic the ruins are , but it just kept playing from the start each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ears . Then again , the game itself is notorious for having loud tracks during important scenes to the point that I had to lower the BGM volume a bit . <p> We 're finally shown- the ending movie , featuring the song " calling " by fhana . The ending shows everyone pretty much having a good time in a picnic . <p> Is this how they 'll play out the story , or is this just a very depressing " what if " that we 'll never get to see happen ? Sadly , I 'm thinking the latter . <p> The next episode previews of the anime are in skit form ! This is certainly a welcome addition and for this episode , it was hilarious .

@@50009898 @3509898/ <h> Tales of Zestiria the X Episode 23 Review <p> I 've been putting this off for a while , but since the 29th is approaching and my review keeps getting longer , I decided to divide it into two separate reviews . Episode 24 is most likely going to be posted tomorrow . <p> Contains MAJOR game spoilers along with MAJOR Berseria spoilers ; read at your own risk ! <p> - <p> Dragon Symonne <p> Episode 23 starts off with Symonne appearing to the group as a dragon . Sorey is angry with the Lord of Calamity for turning his aide into a dragon . <p> The Lord of Calamity does not seem to care . Instead , he tells Sorey that he is going to the center of the world to have one last celebration with Malevolence . He then disappears . <p> Kittybeard ... I mean the Lord of Calamity . <p> What the heck ? What was the point of going to Northgand if Heldalf was going to go somewhere else ? I bet they wanted to further show the viewers the Berseria connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Killaraus . <p> For this episode , there are a lot of good topics for discussion . In general , the whole episode was okay , but it felt a bit rushed and it only left me with more questions . The two major topics I want to talk about for this episode are the Berseria exposition and Dezel . <p> With the Berseria exposition , I feel like it 's too much now . Yes , I get it . Berseria is the prequel , but I was a bit disappointed with how some important aspects of the episode seemed rushed in order to squeeze in Berseria exposition . It 's necessary , I know , but it 's like trying to pour water into a cup that 's already full . <p> There is one little gripe I have regarding the Berseria and Zestiria connection . If Berseria was the prequel that took place 1000 years ago , then why has n't technology advanced in Zestiria ? I mean , it feels like Zestiria is more like the past with the way Berseria had objects like cable cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps , it 's like Final Fantasy X ( Great game , by the way--my opinion ) where all the advanced technology was in the past compared to its current setting . Now that I think about it , Malevolence is at its strongest in Zestiria , so the technology must have reverted due to how chaotic the world has become . <p> Grimorh appears in the story as a little nod to a seraphim 's long life . I believe Grimorh 's age in Berseria was revealed to be 5017 , so she 's around 6017 years old now . She seemed to have changed . I have yet to finish the game ( I just got to the major plot twist of the game ) , but she seems to be less gloomy and happier than she was in the game . It 's good to see characters positively changing as time passes . I do like how the normins seem eager to see her . Though , I 'm curious about Bienfu . Is he still alive ? Phoenix is still alivewait a minutePhoenix appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edna 's umbrella accessory for a thousand years . Poor guy . <p> You 're not going to give fireworks to someone 's tush if they answer ? <p> Then , there 's the story of Innomiant and the Five Lords . For those who have n't played Zestiria , the Five Lords are Hyanoa , Musiphie , Amenoch , Eumacia and Maotelus . They are powerful seraphim that watch over the world ( We only see the physical appearance of Maotelus but never the other four ) . Maotelus is the leader of the Five Lords and serves to replace Innominat , the previous leader . <p> Berseria exposition ! <p> For those who have n't played Berseria ... prepare for spoilers . Innominat and the four lords minus Maotelus were called Empyreans back in Berseria 's timeline . They were worshipped and each of them had their own religion that people worshipped . Although he was the previous leader , Innominat 's role was of the Suppressor , meaning he would appear every 1000 years to purge the world of Malevolence . It 's not a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Artorius ' goal for the plot of Berseria . Yes , Innominat was a villain in Berseria . I have n't finished the game , so I wo n't go in full detail . <p> Anyways , Innominat and the Five Lords were once worshipped in Berseria , but by the time Zestiria 's timeline happened , only Maotelus and the other four are worshipped . Since Zestiria never got into full detail with Innominat ( with it being a major part in Berseria 's plot ) , I do like how Innominat is addressed . <p> The four other lords have a protector seraph that watches over the Shepherd 's trials " an aspect removed from the game , which makes me so sad because I did like the trials ( except for the water trial ) . <p> Anyways , Sorey , Mikleo and Lailah talk about them in this episode . Sorey believes that the Lord of Calamity might be headed to a temple that belonged to one of the Five Lords . I do n't know what temple it is because I have n't finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Throne , the final dungeon in Zestiria because that 's where Maotelus was in the game . <p> Sorey then talks about Velvet . He said that if hate had not been born from her , then calamities would n't have to exist . However , he knows that Artorius ' actions were wrong because he sacrificed her brother Laphicet in order for that hatred to appear in Velvet , which caused her to become the Lord of Calamity . When one war begins , hundreds and thousands of lives are lost . He has no idea what is right and what is wrong because each side has their own reasons for being right and wrong . <p> This is one of Berseria 's major themes . No one is right and wrong in that game . Everyone has their own reasons for doing what they believe is right . <p> Lailah asks what he thinks about right and wrong , to which he replies that he does n't know . Honestly , I think this is a good answer for Sorey . He does n't have a concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom . Sorey is n't wise ; he 's pure . Lailah states that a Shepherd can only find a solid answer when he experiences more about the world through seeing and believing ; I agree with her . Wisdom comes from experience , to which Sorey has yet to have . If he were to have a concrete answer , I would 've been angry , honestly . I 'm glad the writers still left in Sorey 's purity as a part of his character despite butchering most of his and the other characters ' personalities . <p> Zestiria 's main quote . <p> Speaking of Velvet , she appears in his dreams , asking Berseria 's main question : Why do birds fly ? Sorey has never seen a clear picture of Velvet , so I do wonder how she lurks onto his dreams . Could this be a hint that Sorey is a descendant of Eleanor ? Sorey himself is shrouded with mystery since the game never gives him a further explanation of his origins besides being from a destroyed village and had to be taken out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Velvet Crowe <p> When he wakes up from the dream , Sorey sees the moon having a scarlet hue . The Scarlet Night was actually mentioned in Zestiria by an NPC ( I do n't remember where but I believe it was somewhere in Rolance ) , so it 's not a sudden insert . When I saw the Scarlet Night in this episode , I thought to myself that one of them is going to die . <p> The Scarlet Night <p> And my thoughts became truth . One of the party members died : Dezel . The cause of his death differs in the game , but it 's still bittersweet in both versions . In the game , Sorey and friends encounters Lunarre and Symonne in Pendrago . Symonne was the reason why Dezel seeked revenge and used Rose as a pure vessel in order to not get tainted . <p> To summarize his backstory , Dezel and his friend Lafarga liked being with the Windriders , the mercenary band Rose was with long ago . Konan and Rose got engaged , which would ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the leader . Dezel and Lafarga looked on . Dezel knew that their journey with the Windriders was coming to an end , but he did n't want it . He wished for it to not end , which then caused disaster . Konan turned out to be evil and framed the Windriders ( namely Brad ) for murdering the first prince . Lafarga died protecting Rose from the hellion Konan . Symonne told Dezel that all of this happened because of his blessing that became a curse . She labeled him an angel of death . This caused Dezel to seek revenge against Symonne and how everything in Rose 's story became the way it was in the game . <p> He asks Sorey to use Siegfried and shoot at the hellion Symonne summoned that held Rose hostage . Although Mikleo told him his actions would be considered suicide , Dezel did n't care . Sorey eventually shot the gun towards the hellion , which ultimately leads to Dezel 's death . <p> The reason Dezel died in the game was to save and protect Rose . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path that was blocked by Dragon Symonne ( Rose managed to purify Symonne , but I think Symonne died ) . <p> So sad ... <p> In both versions , he apologized to Rose for his actions . For the game , he apologized for letting the Windriders disband because of his selfish wish . For the anime , he apologized for possessing her and trying to push Brad 's dream onto her . Rose , being a nice person , forgives him . Both versions had his departure in a golden abyss and him slowly ascending towards the sky with a smile on his face . <p> Dezel with Unclouded EyesDying with a smile . <p> Although I do n't like Dezel as much as other characters , I think his death was one of the saddest moments in the game . I did n't like how his death was executed in the anime , but the departure scene was still sad . Though , what made the anime superior over the game was how Rose broke down crying after Dezel died after she told him she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene even sadder . <p> It 's okay to cry , Rose . <p> Also , the anime version made Dezel more caring towards Sorey and the other characters seeing their interactions in past episodes in comparison to his minor interactions with the characters in the game . In the game , he tells Rose to kick the group in the ass if they were to mope about his death . In the anime , he tells her to tell Sorey that his death was n't his fault and that if he were to sacrifice , history would repeat itself . I do like that part of his character in the anime more than the game , so another point for the anime . <p> Earlier scenes of Dezel talking to Zaveid about the existence of seraphims was a bit of a foreshadowing to his death since he wondered why he existed . Though , I was n't really too sure why he started having an existential crisis when he was a very straightforward character . I guess it shows that seraphim are no different from humans . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skit where Rose talks to Sorey , Lailah and Mikleo about Dezel watching over her and the sudden gust of wind made the episode 's title even more significant . Dezel most likely became the wind after he died . Now it begs the question : If seraphim die , do they return to the earthpulse or do they turn into their element ? Seraphim never talk about their own deaths in full detail , but I do like the theory of them changing back into their element once they die . I think it makes more sense with the way seraphim exist due to nature . <p> He became the wind . <p> On another note , I do like how Sergei and the other minor characters are learning about malevolence . I think if the world grew more aware , the spreading would stop . <p> More awareness can help prevention . <p> Though , I did n't really like how the minor characters got left behind . Why did they come if they were only going to get left behind ? Well , at least the normins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It makes me wonder what the ending would be like . Would it be like the game or would it take another route ? <p> Squad goals <p> Tales of Zestiria the X <p> The Tales of Zestiria the X anime ( read as " the Cross " ) is a TV series adaptation of Tales of Zestiria that was first announced- during Tales of Festival 2015 as the " Tales of 20th Anniversary Animation " . - The animation is done by ufotable . The first season aired during Summer 2016 , with a second season confirmed for 2017 . Its tagline is " The Journeys of the Shepherd go beyond Zestiria , " and shows hints of connections with Tales of Berseria. - <p> Grace is an aspiring novelist currently rewriting her novel for the umpteenth time . When not writing or playing Tales games , she stares at her laptop for hours , ruining her eyes in the process , and watching anime and Let 's plays . She is also VERY scatterbrained . <p> It 's outright explained in both Zestiria and Berseria that Malevolence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters like Sergei to learn about it . Telling them about it would just cause pointless worry , because there 's nothing they can do to stop it or prevent it from spreading . It 's another one of those moments where the anime does things that seem great on paper but are ultimately pointless to the point that it 's a waste of time even doing it . It 's just like Sergei , Alisha , and her knights very presence in this battle , it 's all pointless since they do n't add anything of worth . <p> Even Dezel 's death in the anime is also pointless here . <p> Leon Kioku <p> There 's a slight chance for them to do more with Zestiria , depending on how they finish the Anime . <p> Mitriko <p> Melchior mentions it when you battle him at Mt.Killarius . Since Velvet woke the 4 great lords and forcibly shoved them into the lifespring to awaken them , it caused an eruption , and they lost the usage of flamestone . As a result , Melchior also mention that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that humanity would not advance technologically . <p> DreamyRequiem <p> Ah , I ca n't help but point at that the anime did something pretty great that no one analyzing these episodes has mentioned : that the story of Velvet Crowe is held by the Royal Family of ROLANCE . Heldalf was a general of Rolance , a respected one , so i do n't think it 'd be too far fetched to think the royal family might 've told him the story before he was cursed . Considering his goal seems to make people suffer as he has suffered , it makes sense ( to me ) that he 'd go as far as to used the wellspring in Kilarius to spread malevolence as that might be the only wellspring that 's marked in human history at this point . And ... to be completely honest ? I actually vastly prefer the anime 's versions of the characters i only because in the game ( to me ) they felt like barely held together pieces of tropes than actual characters ? Like , only alisha , sorey , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly felt stagnant to me , Sorey .... is hard to describe in few words , and Alisha 's was liter ally off screen . ( honestly my main complaint w/ zesty was that they should 've given us an option in zesty to choose like they did in symphonia ? ? but w/e ) THERE ARE MAJOR BERSERIA SPOILERS BELOW . LIKE END GAME CREDITS SPOILERS , PLEASE BE AWARE WHEN PROCEEDING . okay done . Velvet is actually technically still alive at the time of Zestiria , due to using herself to seal Innominat . He devours her , she devours him , it 's a never ending cycle . a ' cycle of destruction ' as Eleanor coins it . Which is probably why Velvet can briefly appear to Sorey--her ' soul ' still lives and is able to connect w/ those alive . I mean , this would be hardly the be the weirdest thing to happen in a tales thing ..... .... though , now that i think on it , what if heldalf 's actual goal is to reawaken innominat by using sorey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to where the wellspring is in the game . If Heldalf offered a soul to the sealed Innominat what would happen ? Would Maotelus disappear ? Would velvet be killed ? Ah , now i hope this is what happens ... <p> Simon Low <p> I do n't like how the anime executes the story . The game 's story makes much more sense and gives much more emotional impact than the anime . Plus , Sorey is a more interesting character in the game . Anime Sorey is too serious ... They really butchered and mess up a lot of the character 's personalities in the anime . I want to hear Edna making jokes and teasing Mibo , I want to listen to Lailah 's bad pun , where the hell the the Perfect curlist - Arma Dylan ! ? <p> Plus , everything are rushed in Season 2 . It is a total mess . I prefer if they stick to the game 's story , like how Sorey and Mikleo learn about their past . I know they want to connect things with Berseria but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already good enough , to make the connection . Where the hell is Mayvin ! ? He had an actual role in the game . However in the anime , he appears for a few episode and then disappears for good . Maybe he will appear in the last episode but who knows . Symmone and Lunarre died in a very weird , crazy and pointless way . Plus , they did n't really participate in the plot that much . I mean , what is the point of them being the villain if they do n't ACT like Villain ? ! <p> Simon Low <p> Why Zestiria is less advanced than Berseria , can be found from the clues here ... <p> From an official " Zestiria World Guidance " book . 200 years ago ( Death Age ) The entire continent was hit with an abnormal plague , and the population was halved . The few Shepherds remaining disappeared from the public 's eye . Following this , the continent went into a state of seclusion and ceased exchange with other continents . It is theorized that Maotelus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shipbuilding and ocean voyage technology was started , however important information was lost . The reason is unknown . <p> And there are a few clues that I found in the game by talking to NPCs in Pendrago. -There have been four dangers severe enough to about to bring a break in the course of history . One of it is known as the " Unprecendented Cataclysm " ( Death Age ) which is 200 years ago . -The world was plunged into chaos 200 years ago ( Death Age ) , which is much like today . But no knows for sure why . With widespread famine , war , natural disasters , it 's is no wonder why the population dropped by a half . So much of humanity 's culture and technology was lost . <p> earthwormjim <p> According to the " Berseria World Guidance " book . <p> All the catastrophes mentioned in the " Zestiria World Guidebook " were actually caused by that third party that you find out about in the EX Dungeon . Every time the world of Zestiria becomes too peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disasters , etc in order to spread malevolence thus causing either the civilizations to lose their knowledge of technology in the ensuing chaos or if the malevolence the chaos generates becomes too much for the world to bear , Inominant and the Emperyons to interfere and reset the world . <p> This is one of the reasons why it 's so pointless for people like Sergei and Alisha 's knights to learn about malevolence because there litereally is nothing they can do to stop it from speading , besides following in Artorius 's footsteps . <h> Facebook <h> Twitter <h> Buy <h> About 142819 @qwx552819

@@50009932 @3509932/ <p> Unlike the Daisuki Sub reviews by a745 , the Funimation Dub reviews will have- a more episodic approach to the series and will not make as much spoiler references to the source material . <p> The episode starts with Velvet and Seres walking along the shoreline in search of a boat . We get a glimpse of the Praetor class Exorcist looking outside his window from the ship , and then we cut to a blonde witch in a pink &amp; purple outfit flying around on some sort of hover board . The ship docks at the port as the Exorcists exit the ship one by one . Seres &amp; Velvet are seen observing them from afar as Seres recognizes the Praetor class Exorcist as Oscar . She appears right in front the Exorcists , asking Oscar why would a Praetor class Exorcist would come to an island like this , to which he responds that he 's here because of the dangerous creatures about . He then expressed distaste that Seres would betray Lord Artorius . Velvet jumps down to join Seres , to which Oscar reacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take their ship and kill Artorius , Oscar fires three bolts of lightning towards the two with his magic . The two survive the warning shots as Oscar introduces his Exorcism blade which was presented to him by Artorius himself . As he stated how he was going treat Velvet in combat since she 's a woman , Velvet grabs a stone and throws it with enough force at one of the Centurions , knocking him off the port ( yes This happened . ) . Oscar takes back what he said , introduces his full name Oscar Dragonia , and states that he 'll arrest Velvet under the order of Lord Artorius . The two engage in a fun combat sequence demonstrating Oscar 's speed and Velvet 's athleticism . It ends as Oscar used his magic to knock Velvet off the port , only for her to recover immediately . <p> The face of someone who can make rock throwing lethal . <p> Oscar advised Velvet to return to the prison and devour demons as he has no business with her here . Velvet then goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she only devours demons only because she had to " she had no choice in the matter . Oscar comments that no matter what , this is her role that she was given to maintain the world , only for Velvet to argue that it 's also the same world that her brother was sacrificed for . Oscar calmly agrees to this ( cold ) , and goes on about the roles that we are given in this world under Lord Artorius ' order . Velvet retorts that this world was made at the cost of her brother 's life . While the Exorcists want to protect this world , her mission is to burn it down . Suddenly , a dragon appears from above . As they examine the beast in the skies , Oscar realized that the dragon was brought her because of Velvet . He orders the Exorcists to fire magic at the dragon , but it managed to dodge these shots and landed right in front of the Centurions , gobbling some of them up . Oscar identifies the dragon as a demon which Seres refuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human malevolence . It 's the whole reason why Artorius wants to change this world . Seres asked if this was truly Artorius ' reasoning but he ignored as he was occupied with the dragon . He fired three lightning bolts which chased the beast , but the dragon avoids it by landing on top of one of their ships , completely demolishing it . The Exorcists fired magic at the beast once more as Oscar asked Seres if she can still rebel against Artorius even though he stands against creatures like this . Seres answers that she was under Artorius ' control for far too long and for now on , she will stick to her own path . Oscar mocks Seres ' statement as he jumps and dives sword first into the dragon 's arm . <p> Velvet ( who is unamused by all of this ) , notices that there 's another ship for her to board behind the dragon . She is then suddenly greeted by the witch from the start of the episode , wondering why all of them here woke her up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on a complaint tirade about these events since she just escaped the prison . Velvet completely ignores the witch 's words and notices the Exorcists immobilizing the dragon with magic . She uses this opportunity to run toward the ship behind the dragon , stating out loud that she needs it to get to Artorius . Unfortunately , the Exorcists were n't able to hold the magic up for long , and the dragon was able to kill the remaining Centurions , leaving Oscar behind . As Velvet was closing in on the ship , the dragon notices Velvet and begins to hunt her down . Velvet was able to escape the initial attack , but she was caught off guard by the dragon 's wind magic . This left her open to a head butt by the dragon itself . She collapses , spewing out blood , but her determination to kill Artorius keeps her alive . The dragon was about to finish Velvet off , only to be interrupted by Seres , who created a magic barrier around Velvet . Seres appears in front of her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll wager her life for Velvet . The dragon was able to break the barrier and it fired large ice shards towards Velvet . We last see Seres shielding Velvet from these shards before the dragon used its breath to launch both of them through the depths of the prison behind them . <p> The dragon was about to pursue its prey until it was interrupted by a magic blast casted by the Pink Witch from before . She states that she 'll attempt to keep Velvet alive because she needs someone who can man the ship to escape the island . The Swordsman with the demonic eye from the previous episode also appears and attacks the dragon with a diving slash . He says he 'll help since he needs to get off the island too . The two introduce themselves to each other as Rokurou and the Mighty Sorceress Magikirika Merin Doudin Nolorundo ( I tried . ) , Magilou for short . After their introductions , they prepare themselves to take down the dragon . We cut to the prison where we find Velvet waking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near death . Velvet wondered why she protected her , to which Seres states that it was because Velvet would stop at nothing to stop Artorius . She then offered to help Velvet if Velvet eats her before she dies . Velvet was still confused by all this , but Seres explains that she took an oath that provided her amazing power , and Velvet can acquire this power by eating her . Velvet , preparing to devour her , wondered why Seres would go through all of this . Seres responds that the answer is akin to an indistinguishable fire that lurks in the shadows of her heart , the same way that it flares in Velvet . She offers a comb which Velvet recognized was Laphi 's " her little brother . Velvet then grabs Seres head with her demonic claw , stating that she wo n't offer no thanks nor apology , which Seres accepts . As her mask shatters , we see an image of a much younger Velvet and Laphi before Velvet successfully absorbs Seres ' life &amp; power . In doing so , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabs right away . <p> Back outside , Magilou &amp; Rokurou were battling the dragon with their magic board and twin daggers ( but not the HUGE SWORDON YOUR BACK. ) respectively , but the dragon swiped them away with its claw . They continued to struggle with the beast until Velvet appeared from the prison she was knocked into . She uses her claw , strengthened by Seres ' power , to blast the dragon with a fire spell . In witnessing this , Oscar realized Seres ' fate . Velvet uses her claw to grasp at the dragon 's throat , and brings it down to the ground . She screams as she digs her claw deeper into the dragon 's neck . Suddenly , a lightning bolt stabs Velvet from the back . She turns to Oscar , who states that he ca n't let Velvet loose in the world because of how monstrous she 's become . She then demands Oscar to inform Artorius that Velvet Crowe will be coming for him , threatening that she 'll destroy all demons , Malakim , and Exorcists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat , and the scene fades to black . <p> We then cut to the morning shores and find Rokurou steering a ship in the seas . Magilou &amp; Velvet are- onboard too . As Velvet stared at the comb given by Seres , she looks to the skies and notices a crow flying about . This reminded her of a conversation she had about birds with her brother Laphi , who had green clothes and yellow hair . The flashback suddenly cuts to Laphi and a man with a blade standing beneath a red moon . Laphi was shown impaled on the man 's blade as they 're surrounded by a bunch of dead bodies , with Velvet witnessing all of this in the background . The man with the blade introduces himself as Artorius Collbrande , and that he 'll restore law and order to the world . Velvet , covered in blood , screams out to Artorius . He stands in front of the red moon as 6 other figures suddenly appear around him . The flashback ends when Velvet orders Rokurou to go to the Midgand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its capital . The episode closes off with the credits and the Tales of Berseria OP from the game . <p> It 's really hard to give much of a review to this episode since it 's only as a preview for the next game in the series , where the goal is to condense as much of the beginning of the story as possible to highlight the important parts only . I 've given my perspective as a fan of the series , but to the average viewer this is still a bit jarring . Now that the two Tales of Berseria episodes are done , we 'll be going back to the main story , and one has to wonder how they 'll connect to the plot that these two episodes introduced " or if they 'll even come back to Tales of Berseria at all during this anime 's run . It 's like being fed two meals at the same time . You 're enjoying this delicious curry for a couple of minutes , but then the waiter takes it from you mid-meal and serves you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish , suddenly the waiter comes back to take away the second meal and you 're given back the portion from before . It 's practically a tease at this point . Maybe that was the reason why they went with this approach . They 're trusting the viewers who managed to stick to this point to consider whether they 'll want to purchase Tales of Berseria or not . Going with risks like this can definitely scare off some people ( as I 've mentioned in my previous summary. ) but who knows ? Maybe the game might benefit off of this in the end . Either or , I personally hope that they do n't do this for any other Tales of anime shows but since we 're already this far , I guess those who are still watching up to this point are used to the fact that it could jump back and forth . I would n't be surprised if the shifts do n't maintain the masses though . <p> Regarding the Dub/Translation : I 've gotten used to Velvet 's dubbed voice already . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to display her range when she was talking about her brother . I 've no complaints with Magilou &amp; Oscar 's voices either .

@@50009950 @3509950/ <p> The latest issue of Famitsu Magazine talks a little bit more about the newly revealed character Lyla as well as how battles will go in Tales of Zestiria . <p> As we reported before , Lyla is a Tenzoku/Divine of the Fire element . She is a Divine that dwells within the legendary " Holy Sword " meant for Doushis/Priests . For a long time now and due to an event in the past , she has been waiting for someone who can become the Priest . Upon meeting Slay , her hope is rekindled . Forming a contract with Slay , she now watches over him in order to make him into a full-fledged Priest . <p> The magazine also mentions that , ideally , a Priest should make a contract with 4 Divine of 4 different elements . However , no one has ever managed to do that so far . <p> So , 4 elements . With Mikulio for water , Edna for Earth and Lyla for Fire , all we 're waiting for is the Divine for wind . <p> Now , on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tenzoku have their own fighting styles . Based on the info , it seems to be a bit similar to Tales of Graces F 's battle system . From what we 've seen so far , humans ( technically , Slay and Alicia ) are more in-tune with melee strike combat while the Tenzoku ( Mikulio , Edna and Lyla ) are more of mage-type characters . <p> This is further confirmed in the magazine : human characters use fast , close-range base artes with the use of the Circle button , while the X button let 's them use more powerful arcane artes . For the Tenzoku , the Circle button let 's them use mid-range base artes while the X button let 's them use powerful , far-reaching Magic Artes . So far , there is no info regarding a regular attack button - just these artes , which makes it appear to be an adaptation of Tales of Graces ' battle system of sorts . <p> The magazine also tells more about Mikulio and Edna 's fighting styles . Mikulio uses a long staff , and is hence able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is able to accumulate spiritual energy and unleash them for stronger attacks later on . Some of his basic , strike artes are called ? ? ( Kiri Mizu , literally " slicing water " ) and ? ? ( Tachi Mizu , literally " reaching water " ) . As a Divine of the water element , Mikulio has water artes at his disposal , such as the classic Splash , and other magic artes called Twin Flow and Violet High . He 's also able to heal , specifically more on individual party members . Edna , who uses an umbrella , has more close-range attacks . Some of her basic artes include Powder Snow and Sky , while her magic artes include Embrace End , Rock Lance and Air Pressure . <p> In addition , the magazine mentions that the dragons are so-called " Apostles of Destruction .

@@50010095 @3510095/ <h> Tales of Series Game Coming to Nintendo Switch by March 2018 <h> Get ready for Tales on the Switch <p> Bandai Namco Group Japan- reveals in its annual financial report presentation that a Tales game is slated for the Nintendo Switch for this fiscal year . <p> In Bandai Namco Group Japan 's annual financial report presentation , the company reveals that they have a " Tales of Series " title planned ( at the lower right , listed at the bottom of the list ) , along with Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 and Taiko- Master . <p> The said game is listed for this fiscal year , meaning they plan to have the game released- by March 2018 . Bandai Namco 's fiscal year spans April 1st to March 31st . <p> At present , we still do n't know if it will be an entirely new game or a port of some sort .

Abyssal Chronicles will be there at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so stay tuned for news updates from us ! 142818 @qwx552818 <p> I hope for the Switch it 's a whole new mothership title otherwise it wo n't be a system seller . Personally I would prefer the next mothership title to be on the PS4 since that 's the system I have and I 'm not interested at all in the Switch . It 's selfish but I hope it will be a port already existing on PS3 or 4 . <p> If it 's a new mothership title or Radiant Mythology 4 and exclusive to the Switch I 'll buy that system , hoping I wo n't regret it later ( I bought an Xbox 360 for Vesperia and finally got a better version not even one year later on the PS3 I already owned ... ) . <p> GraysonXIV <p> While a port seems likely given the timing , I really hope it 's something other than ToZ or ToB .

@@50010144 @3510144/ <h> Seriously , Sorey did step aside . <p> Before you venture into this review , you might want to read the full notice below . <p> Notice : This episode pretty much consists of moments of the Tales of Berseria game itself . If you 're avoiding spoilers for the game , you might want to avoid this , too . This is also based on the- DAISUKI.net release . <p> As previously announced , episodes #05 and #06 of Tales of Berser " Zestiria the X will cross over with Tales of Berseria ... though by cross over , I think they meant BERSERIA WILL TAKE OVER . And take over it did . The entire episode is about Tales of Berseria , specifically from the time Velvet is on her way from breaking out of the prison island of Titania . As such , this might actually be spoilers for those yet to play the game ( it is n't even out yet ) , so be forewarned . <p> And want to understand more about Tales of Berseria and whatever the exorcists , malakim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read our Tales of Berseria page . <p> No opening this week . We 're greeted with the sight of a woman in tattered clothes sitting on the floor of what seems to be a dungeon . From her heavily bandaged hand seeps what seems to be some sort of smoke ... aura ... malevolence even ? Monsters approach her , but she easily attacks one- and seems to absorb ... no , devour- it with her left hand . She does the same for the remaining one , - easily fending them it off- with her now disfigured left arm , and also devours them . She is then engulfed in blue light , and falls to the ground . This light , whatever it is , seems to be absorbing her own energy . From above her , the bars of her deep pit prison suddenly open . Cue title of Tales of Zestiria the X ... <p> My take on this is that the prison keeps her in check by absorbing her powers or energy every now and then , or when she eats those monsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zestiria anymore - Welcome to Tales of Berseria , confirmed far off prequel to Zesty . Meet its main protagonist , Velvet Crowe . <p> From the now opened prison descends a woman clad in white . She seemingly floats down to its bottom , but does n't notice Velvet in the darkness . Velvet attacks her , but she easily makes- her back off by incinerating her left arm for a bit . The woman addresses her , but all Velvet wants to know- is where " that man " is ( though she does ask why a Malak of his is there ) . It seems that Velvet has spent a good chunk of her life stuck in this darkness and endured it , all because of her hatred for " that man . " <p> The girl explains that she broke many barriers to get to her and that the Exorcists- outside might have- already noticed this break in , so they have to hurry. - She- uses her power to make the ladder from above the prison to descend down , and the two make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found them . As the girl in white prepares to attack with her fire , Velvet steps up . With an impressive display of physical prowess , she easily defeats the exorcists . I personally really love the music here . And it does n't sound at all anything Sakuraba would compose so ... this might be Shiina 's work . <p> I came here to have a good time and I 'm honestly feeling so attacked right now . <p> The two make a bolt for it and reach a fork . The girl wants to go the other way , but Velvet chooses the opposite direction ? Why ? Because that 's the direction of the barriers the girl broke . This actually does n't make sense to me because ... why in the world would Seres even choose the other way ? <p> They make their way to what seems to be a confiscated items storage room . Velvet finds a few pieces of scrap cloth and uses them as clothes , along with a weapon . The girl commends her decision earlier , praising her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ( but you were . Going the other way ) , while Velvet throws away some rope . <p> Rope ... ? Useless ? Really ? ? <p> Also in the room is this really long sword they call a Tempest Blade ( or Stormblade if you watched Funimation 's subs . This does n't have a localized term yet ) . Seres suggests they take it , but Velvet says it 's something she ca n't use , and there really wo n't be any point in a powerful weapon if it ca n't be used properly . <p> I have somewhat mixed feelings on- how they 're portraying Velvet . She 's a mix of emo sprinkled with brashness , but beneath all that is actual wit . The wit part is the part I really , really like . I mean , she actually thinks . However , 7 minutes into this episode and all she can really think about is Artorius , Artorius , ARTORIUS . I know he did something bad to you , Vel , but calm down for a second . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artorius whereabouts . Artorius is in the capital of Midgand , of Rogress . She- explains that the world has completely changed since the events from years ago. - Malakim- descended into the world , and together with the exorcists , they drove away the Daemons . The man Velvet is after , Artorius Collbrande , is now head of the exorcists , and acts as the sword and shield of the people . Basically , everyone loves him as the " savior . " He managed to obtain this power from sacrificing " that child , " who is actually Velvet 's little brother . The girl , however , adds , that his power is not yet complete , and that he can still be " killed . " <p> Honey , I do n't understand how you can have almost every inch of your body , including your eyes , covered but have your chest almost popping out like that . <p> Velvet questions her , Seres , - instead - she , who was once a firm believer and Malak under Artorius , is helping her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if they can escape successfully . <p> The two are alarmed by the sound of someone approaching . Seres immediately extinguishes the flames from the torches around them , and the two hide . A man enters , seemingly looking for something , but eventually leaves . <p> From earlier , the Tempest Blade is extremely long . Seeing as Velvet is sitting down here , I 'm assuming the crate covering her from view is short - meaning the Tempest Blade should have been poking out earlier . But hey , it 's dark , so whatever . <p> As the two get up from hiding , the guy is actually just behind Velvet . He captures her and threatens her , but Velvet merely laughs . She recognizes right away that the guy is also a prisoner , and he really wo n't get much from threatening a fellow prison breaker . <p> Wait a gosh darn minute . Seres was literally just behind Velvet when they emerged from hiding . Did she not notice this peculiar guy standing between her and Velvet for a good 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the guy backs away and realizes that all the exorcists swarming the place is after these two . The man is also a Daemon , but throughout the episode we do n't really get to know his name . But if you 've been paying attention to all the Tales of Berseria news and such , you 'll know that he 's Rokurou Rangetsu . <p> He also wants to break out , though Seres points out again that there are Exorcists everywhere . Rokurou says he 's still looking for his partner anyway , which is ... conveniently being held by Velvet right now ! Yep , his partner is that Tempest Blade thing . Rokurou wants it back , but Velvet claims it for herself . <p> This pisses Rokurou off and brings out a couple of daggers to fight Velvet . Velvet initially intends to use the Tempest Blade on him , but then moves to interrogate him - if he can use that sword and if he can cut down Exorcists with it . Rokurou proudly declares that the couple of daggers he got from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to keikaku . <p> Velvet declares that she 'll now return the blade , but under some terms . <p> Tag yourself , I 'm the " friend no one listens to . " <p> The three calm down and discuss business . Velvet mentions that Seres probably has a boat and asks where it is . Seres is impressed that she knew it 's an island . Velvet adds she 's aware that it 's a prison island where Daemons are kept , and that some of the prey they 've been throwing at her had mentioned it as they begged for their lives " <p> I just realized that since they never bothered to give Velvet the luxury of a bath or a toilet , then they might not have fed her ? ? If her Daemon arm literally just ... eats and stuff , then does that mean she can also get nutrients from it , thereby negating the need for food ? ? Gosh this episode just gives me so many questions argh ! <p> *cough* Moving on ... Seres mentions that the island has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back . Seres 's boat is docked over at the back harbor . Of course , they should expect Exorcists waiting for them there . Velvet mentions that if it were up to her , they 'd ship out all the boats to ultimately trap them there , and it 's probably what the Exorcists are planning . In the end , she plans to decrease the Exorcist numbers and then create a scene where they 'll be able to take a boat . <p> Ultimately , they plan a riot . The island is literally a Daemon prison , housing at least 1,000 Daemons there , with the level they 're in having individual cells . With this , there wo n't be a chance for them to send out all their ships . <p> GUYS . STOP . FLIRTING . <p> The three reach a confinement area housing a considerable concentration of Daemons . A few Exorcists suddenly arrive , but Velvet and Rokurou easily deal with them . Velvet notes that Rokurou 's particularly strong . <p> Seres : Alohomora ! <p> With that cleaned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her powers . The swarms of Daemons casually stroll- rush out of their cells . <p> But seriously , the beginning was the calmest prison break I 've ever seen . Maybe I 've watched too many movies , but usually when prison breaks happen , the prisoners run out of their cells yelling in joy , like a proper riot should be . <p> Rokurou : PRISONNNN BREAKKKKK ! ! ! Daemon 1 : I say ! <p> Rokurou , unfortunately , parts ways with them here , but he tells them of a route going up as thanks for bringing him back the Tempest Blade . Rokurou runs with the other Daemons , while Velvet and Seres head up the prison . <p> Seres : See , if you kept that rope from earlier , then this would n't have been a problem.Velvet : ... <p> The two reach the top of the prison , but there seems to be no means of getting away ( gee , what did you think , going all the way up this prison tower ? ) . <p> Ahh Seres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But no one listens to her . Tsk tsk . <p> Seres suggests turning back , since a jump from this high would probably just kill Velvet . The sounds of the Exorcists come near , making Seres shut the door with her powers . <p> As they think of what to do , Velvet is driven by the memory of Artorius and her brother . Using her hand as a hook of sorts , she makes the jump . <p> First Sorey , now you ? VELVET NO . <p> That landing , of course , is anything but smooth , and she accidentally rams- her right shoulder onto the cold , hard ground upon landing . Not only does she get a horrible bruise on her shoulder , - but she also either fractures or dislocates her humerus or her radius . <p> VELVET . NO . YOU 'RE WORSE THAN SOREY . <p> And in medical terms we call this move a Manual Closed Reduction of a fracture . It is , by the way , very , very , VERY painful without anesthesia . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you happen to have a fracture that needs this done , then well , get ready to scream . Unless you have money to shelf out , then they 're going to do the Manual Reduction right then and there at the ER , no anesthesia . And I can tell you , my memory of Orthopedic rotation in the ER is nothing but screams and cries of little kids getting their bones pushed back into place . A privately-managed hospital , of course , is an entirely different story . <p> Anyway , Seres descends from above and tends to her wound on her right shoulder ... which makes me question if maybe Velvet waited for a teensy minute , then Seres would probably have been able to do something about that fracture of hers . <p> Seres commends her strength , and likens it to an oath ... She describes an oath as a rite of restraining words and actions in exchange for power . The more limitations on oneself , the more powerful the power . In this sense , however , Velvet likens it more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively mentioned in Tales of Zestiria , the most prominent one being Lailah 's oath that enabled her to have the powers of purification . In exchange for that , she could n't talk about her past with the previous Shepherd and whatnot . <p> Just as the epic music slowly creeps in , the two are alarmed by the sound of a ship nearing the island - Seres recognizes it as a ship- of the Legate Exorcists , a rank higher than those measly Praetor Exorcists they battled . Seres declares that their journey is about to get harder . Velvet , of course , is prepared for it . We 're greeted by a peek at who is in the ship - it 's Oscar Dragonia , one of Artorius 's Legate Exorcists . <p> As the two walk on , Seres wonders . Will Velvet 's hatred for Artorius bring about hope for the world ? Or would it only spread malevolence ? They will know in the future , when it crosses . <p> No like she literally says " cross " for the added Tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode ends with the Tales of Zestiria game opening playing for the last 2 minutes . Those confused about this - we reported earlier that the episodes 5 and 6 that were shown during that pre-screening event last August 5th have different versions as the ones to be aired . From those who went to the advanced screening , apparently the game opening has just been used as a filler for parts that were cut off which were deemed to be too much of a spoiler , so that 's that. - I stand corrected , apparently the episode is the same as the one during the pre-screening . The Zesty game opening was also shown there . Perhaps the next episode will be the one that 's different , since it apparently covers a pretty big spoiler . <p> After the opening , we 're greeted with credits and- instrumental music for the next 1 and a half minute . Seems they literally cut off a lot from that episode . Well , at least the ending has awesome music . This track sounds something Go Shiina would compose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't exactly completely announced or anything , Go Shiina is also working on Tales of Berseria 's music along with Motoi Sakuraba in this game . Go Shiina was even at Japan Expo last month to promote it , along with God Eater , of course . <p> All in all , I have very mixed feelings about this entire episode . As much as we were given the heads up that this episode ( and next week 's ) will be about Berseria , it might be a bit of a surprise for those who are regularly just watching the anime as just the anime ( i.e. no Tales background or has no idea about Zesty and Bersy ) . It also does n't really help that last week ended in such a huge cliffhanger . I realize it can be frustrating for some viewers . <p> So far though , this episode does n't have that much of a spoiler , but I fear for next week . <p> Woah . Seriously guys . Turn down the flirting . As usual , tons of screenshots of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . See you next week ! <p> Tales of Berseria <p> Tales of Berseria is the latest- mothership title of the Tales of Series which was first announced during- Tales of Festival 2015 . The game was released- for both the PS3 and PS4 on August 18 , 2016 in- Japan , January 24 , 2017 in North America and January 27 , 2017 in Europe- for the PS4 and PC . The game features a female protagonist named Velvet and a theme of pirates and ships . It 's also confirmed as a distant prequel to Tales of Zestiria . <p> The Tales of Zestiria the X anime ( read as " the Cross " ) is a TV series adaptation of Tales of Zestiria that was first announced- during Tales of Festival 2015 as the " Tales of 20th Anniversary Animation " . - The animation is done by ufotable . The first season aired during Summer 2016 , with a second season confirmed for 2017 . Its tagline is " The Journeys of the Shepherd go beyond Zestiria , " and shows hints of connections with Tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two episodes will be playable in-game , or is it like Ep . 0 where it 's before that ? Because that arm seems a bit too powerful to send me into a tutorial blindly and expect me to do anything other than button-mash blindly =-p <p> For the ToZ stuff , Funimation 's subs have matched the game more , but I prefer Daisujke 's for ToB so far . Though seeing daemon spelled like that was making the computer nerd here twitch &gt;. &gt; <p> Teamster Sub <p> I strongly suspect that these episodes are the beginning of the game . They 're essentially equivalent to Zesty 's OVA . <p> I have n't seen the ToZ OVA , since the US only got it with the collector 's edition . However , I got that edition for my birthday and it 's on its way to me now XD <p> Simon Low <p> I think this is how the game will start . Because the trailers of Berseria seems to have the same scene in this episode . I also read something from a website , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prison Island , Titania . And velvet escapes the prison .... <p> Avon Avery <p> I think the game will start at Velvet 's homwtown before the Scarlet/Red Moon appears - so 3 years before she gets in prison . <p> itsameluigi1290 <p> Well , I know the beginning of the game appears to take place in the prison , at least for cutscenes . I played the demo , the arm is pretty useful , but I would n't say it 's overpowered . It 's limited to how much Soul Gauge you have , so you ca n't use it too much . It also only lasts a few seconds . It should be balanced enough , and there 's always the difficulty that you can change ! <p> A+da Raineri <p> I took at least over 1k screenshots ... XD like the whole episode ? <p> Yeahh I also thought they 're flirting but mostly in the preview . I liked this episode and .. you made me laugh a lot with ALOHOMORA ! I did n't expect this *cackles* I love your reviews and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's always fun to see your captions ; D ( Yes velvet why did you leave the rope ? ROPE IS NEVER USELESS WHEN IMPRISONED ! ) <p> Tbh I found that at the beginning Seres ' clothing was " tighter " and the more we got into the episode , the more her chest " popped " out .. xDD <h> Facebook <h> Twitter <h> Buy <h> About 142819
