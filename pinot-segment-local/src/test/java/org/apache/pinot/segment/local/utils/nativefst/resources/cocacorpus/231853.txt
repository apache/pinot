@@99642703 @3842703/ <p> Applying for verification is a little work requires filling out an application . So is it worth it ? What 's in it for teachers ? <p> The most important benefit for teacher verification is having access to textbook solutions . This is why we take so much care to ensure only actual teachers become verified . Regrettably , this means some actual teachers do n't gain access , though we will spend a lot of time working with a teacher since sometimes verification is harder ( e.g. if the teacher is not yet listed on a faculty page ) . <p> The second benefit that we only entrust with verified teachers is the option to invite other teachers . This is important , since inviting another teacher will auto-verify that teacher upon registration . If you find our resources helpful , then by inviting other teachers you know , you can help them get easy access to these same benefits without the need to formally apply for verification . This also saves our staff time , allowing us to build more resources ! <p> The last major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of an OpenIntro textbook . Our goal is to provide better service than traditional publishers , and as part of that , we want to help get our book into more teachers ' hands . <p> Verification Options <p> The best option is to provide a link to a faculty page that shows you are an instructor and that also lists your email address . Even if you registered with another email address , we can still complete the process with this information ; it will just require an extra step on your part -- replying to a verification email sent to the email listed on the faculty page . <p> If ( 1 ) you have recently moved schools , ( 2 ) your previous email address is listed on a faculty page , and ( 3 ) you still have access to that email address ( or get messages forwarded to your new address ) , we can use your previous email address for verification . When you register , you can ( and should ! ) still use your new email address , and then when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ URL from your previous position and let us know to look for you on there . We 'll just follow-up with a short confirmation email to your old address . <p> If you have a fellow teacher who is already verified , then the easiest way to get verified is to ask them to invite you to openintro.org . When they are logged in , they 'll see an extra option under the Essentials section of the Teachers page where they can invite a fellow teacher . It 's even okay if you 've already registered ; in that case , your account will become verified when the teacher invites you . <p> Another common option for completing verification is by having a fellow teacher vouch for you . For example , if you are new to a school , maybe you 're not yet listed on the faculty page . In that case , another teacher in the department who is listed on the faculty page can vouch for you . If you want to go this route , just send us the name of the person who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page . <p> There 's another option for high school teachers : teachers who register using an email address ending with k12.ca.us , k12.ky.us , or some other official K12 state variant can often be verified even without having a faculty page . If this is the option that fits your case , just go up for verification ; it 's likely your application will be approved without any special requests .

@@99642735 @3842735/ <p> The 3rd Edition of OpenIntro Statistics was released in July 2015 . Below are the main changes : <p> The t distribution is used exclusively in the Inference for Numerical Data chapter ( Ch 5 ) . <p> Some data sets are replaced with newer or more interesting data sets . <p> Some exercises are revamped , and some entirely new exercises have been added . The number of exercises has increased by a small amount . <p> Video icons were added to sections where videos are available , and these are hyperlinked in the PDF . <p> Section 8.2 , which focuses on variable selection in multiple regresion , now highlights the usage of adjusted R-squared instead of p-values for variable selection . Both approaches are still featured , but adjusted R-squared is featured more prominently . <p> Section 3.2.2 in the Second Edition , which covers calculations for the normal probability plot , was eliminated . Additionally , the R function qqline() is now used throughout the textbook for the normal probability plot , whereas a custom function was previously used . <p> The within-text exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now called Guided Practice to eliminate duplicate " exercise " numbering with end-of-chapter exercises . <p> We dropped the df &gt; 1 condition for the chi-square test . The reasoning on why it was introduced is subtle : a 1-prop test can be turned into a chi-square test with df = 1 , but then we only need 5 successes / failures for the 2-prop test , so the conditions do n't match . Anyways , we removed this condition for simplicity . <p> The section on calculating power ( Section 4.6 ) was removed and a new section was added in Chapter 5 that covers power in the context of an experiment . This new section should be much easier to follow , and the example is also a much more common power calculation context . <p> There were other minor changes , e.g. fixing typos identified in the Second Edition . <p> Full details of all updates are logged in GitHub .
