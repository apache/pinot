But are we giving them enough opportunities to feel useful or are we leaving them on the shelf , wrapped in cotton wool ? <p> In what promises to be the biggest online survey of what Australian kids are actually doing to help their families , University of Melbourne researchers have teamed with the ABC 's Behind the News program to ask the children themselves what chores they do and how they feel about helping out . <p> The survey will ask children how they really feel about household chores . Picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanded version of the program 's 2015 Happiness Survey that attracted almost 20,000 respondents . The results could lead to new recommendations on how parents , teachers and community services can better engage with children in building personal resilience given evidence that " required helpfulness " can foster self-esteem . <p> " We want to find out whether having jobs to do around the house and family helps children build their self-esteem and resilience by asking the kids what they do , how they feel about doing jobs , whether the chores are directed or self-driven , and what sort of satisfaction they experience from contributing , " says Associate Professor Lisa Gibbs , Director of the University 's Jack Brockhoff Child Health and Wellbeing Program within the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health . <p> " By asking the children themselves we can not only find out what is going on in families , but we can also uncover alternative possibilities based on what children say . " <h> An insight into family resilience <p> Professor Gibbs , who has received crucial grant support from the Myer Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resilience . <p> " There is emerging evidence of the contribution children can make to preparedness and recovery in areas affected by disaster . Given the opportunity , children can make a meaningful contribution to family and community resilience . " <p> The idea that it is important to foster a child 's capacity to help others goes back to groundbreaking research published in the 1970s on the impact of the Great Depression on US families that suggested many kids thrive when the going gets tough . <p> By analysing longitudinal survey data , US sociologist Glen Elder discovered that among families hit by poverty during the Great Depression , people who were infants at the time , and so wholly dependent on adults , struggled throughout their later lives to overcome their circumstances . <p> But he found that those children who were aged 9-10 when the Depression hit and threw their families into poverty tended to instead do much better later in life . Importantly , they outperformed their peers whose families had been unscathed by the Depression . Professor Elder theorised that these children benefited from increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <p> During the Great Depression in the US , children had to help their families out . Picture : Flickr <p> US psychologist Emmy Werner 's groundbreaking longitudinal study of 698 infants born in 1955 went further . She tracked her participants through to the age of 40 and found that those who proved to be resilient in the face of hardships in their early lives also tended to be those who has been actively involved in " required helpfulness " during their middle childhood and adolescence . <p> But if required helpfulness helps build self-esteem and resilience , what then is happening with children now when most enjoy a standard of living that the Depression kids could only have dreamed of ? Do we need to be providing more opportunities for children to feel useful and worthwhile ? How much responsibility is too much ? <h> Changing times <p> Child welfare expert and honorary professorial fellow in social work at the University of Melbourne , Professor Dorothy Scott , worries that modern Australian children may be missing out on the self-worth that comes from doing meaningful help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family was an economic unit in which everyone needed to work and contribute to keep food on the table . <p> But in the wake of the technological and digital revolutions , she argues that families are now units of " passive consumption " . She suggests modern children may be at risk of losing some of the resilience that appears to come from being useful and helping others . <p> In our consumer society , children are at risk of losing resilience . Picture : Thijs <p> " The historical shift in families is very clear . When the family was an economic unit , children were an important part of it . But now in our consumer society , children have only a minor role to play in terms of contributing to the household , " says Professor Scott , a former Foundation Chair in Child Protection and the Director of the Australian Centre for Child Protection at the University of South Australia . <p> " Positive psychology talks of resilience being related to factors like being part of something larger than yourself as an antidote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothesis is that by promoting required helpfulness and contributing to the wellbeing of others we might be able to help children build their own identity . <p> " That is why we need some contemporary research like this to ask children what they are doing in their daily lives . At the moment we do n't know how contemporary families work in this respect . " <p> Professor Scott says it would be interesting , for example , to know whether children are commonly receiving pocket money for doing jobs around the house and whether such pocket money is motivating them , or whether they are deriving satisfaction from simply helping . <h> Huge online audience <p> The idea for Behind the News to survey children on their happiness was initially a one-off initiative in 2015 that stemmed from Mental Health Week occurring during the October school holidays when the program was n't on air . Rather than just ignore it , the program decided to leverage the online interactivity of its audience to survey them and report on the results . They were inundated . <p> " The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids to talk about because ordinarily mental health is a fairly difficult subject , " says Behind the News host Nathan Bazley . " We 'd hoped to get maybe 8000 responses , but we received more than double that and I think that is because the kids were just really excited about giving feedback . " <p> Among the survey results , over half of respondents reported nearly always feeling happy but a quarter reported being worried all the time about the future and their families . Two-thirds reported having experienced being bullied , and 15 per cent reported often not feeling valued . <p> The results intrigued Associate Professor Gibbs and her team . They immediately recognised the potential of the huge survey pool Behind the News had generated if only more rigour could be added , such as seeking demographic information from the kids . For example , information such as postcode location can indicate socio-economic status . <p> When she proposed collaboration , Mr Bazley jumped at the chance to improve the survey and have research support to analyse the results . They are now looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next one to run this year . <p> As part of further developing the survey , Professor Gibbs ' team will host workshop sessions with children at participating schools and sporting clubs to involve them as co-researchers by asking them what questions the researchers need to be asking , and getting their help in interpreting the results . There may also be opportunities for them to appear on Behind the News as ' Rookie Reporters ' , filing their own reports on the survey results . <p> Behind the News features stories for and about young people . Picture : Behind the News <p> " I 'm really excited to see where we can go with the survey and the relationship with the University . Instead of having experts telling kids information , we can now have kids telling experts what they think , and that could be a powerful tool for making policymakers take notice of what kids are saying , " says Mr Bazley . <p> Professor Gibbs says health researchers can only dream of the kind of response that the Behind the News survey generated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . <p> " The collaboration provides a great opportunity to gain an insight into children 's lives . Children have a unique and valuable perspective that is different from that of adults , but it is n't often listened to . " <p> Professor Gibbs remembers researching recently with school children about how they thought childhood had changed compared to previous generations . She was surprised when children complained that their parents paid more attention to their phones , tablets or computers than to their kids . <p> " As child health researchers we can focus too much on what the kids are doing , rather than asking the kids what the adults are doing . When they told me the parents were always on devices I thought ' yes , of course ' , but it was only when they brought it up that it occurred to me . " <p> The question now is what kids think of helping out . Their University 's Privacy Officer at **30;56;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> Virtual reality brings the past to life <p> Technology will allow us to reconstruct and explore ancient worlds , adding to our understanding of history <p> By Simon Young , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> I 'm standing at the centre of the Aren ? s de Lut ? ce in Paris , which is already spread with sand to soak up the blood that will flow once the gladiatorial games start . Surrounded by the empty stone terraces that loom 45m high , I 'm filled with dread , but also ... excitement . Is this the same excitement the ancient Gallo-Romans felt some 2000 years ago ? <p> Of course I 'm not living 2000 years ago . I 'm not even in Paris , where the actual site is a humble park in the 10th Arrondissement . I 'm in Melbourne wearing a virtual reality headset . But I 'm not experiencing some imaginary world . I 'm inside an ancient Roman gladiatorial arena recreated from decades of painstaking archaeological research . <p> It is as real as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoveries it will only get more accurate . <p> Welcome to the virtual reality revolution that is transforming our experience of archaeology and our past . Archaeology has always had a glamorous reputation ; you only have to think of Raiders of the Lost Ark . But archaeological work is deeply unglamorous , involving patient sifting and digging of outwardly boring looking stonework and soil layers , matched with precise measuring and more measuring . <p> University and museum shelves are burgeoning with the fruit of more than a century of archaeological labour laid out in journal articles , monographs and books that usually only other archaeologists consult . <p> But with the same attention to detail that is the hallmark of an archaeologist , we can now transform this data into an accurate three dimensional experience that can engage the public and even extend our knowledge , as 3D structures allow archaeologists to better understand how these buildings functioned and what questions are unanswered . <p> That same unglamorous work is exactly how my colleagues and I have constructed Aren ? s de Lut ? ce in 3D . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humble archaeologists . A standard virtual reality setup would have cost about $80,000 . But today , we can experience high quality virtual reality with nothing more than a smartphone and Google Cardboard , which costs about $15 . <p> It was an opportunity that I could n't resist . Everyone interested in the ancient world longs to be able to explore the streets of ancient Rome or wander through ancient Athens during the golden age of Pericles and there was no shortage of collaborators wanting to apply this technology , from like-minded archaeologists to computer modellers . <p> Ar ? nes de Lut ? ce , a gladiatorial arena/theatre in the 10th Arrondissement , Paris , in the 1st century CE . <p> We began by scoping the scenes and collecting accurate measurements and research of every part of the remains to ultimately develop a plausible framework of both the construction materials and the architecture . <p> Using a combination of cutting-edge software platforms , we were able to reconstruct the building digitally . The reconstruction was then vetted and refined by myself and my colleagues to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then installed in an immersive VR headset for viewing . <p> The implications of this revolution are profound and far-reaching . Students and enthusiasts halfway around the world will be able to don a virtual reality headset and explore the ancient world at their leisure , effortlessly transporting themselves from one location to another . <p> People can still travel and experience relatively intact ruins like the Colosseum , the Acropolis , and the Pyramids , but many of the ancient world 's most magnificent structures are today nothing more than tantalising foundation stones , or rubble scattered across grassy fields , or crumbling away unvisited in inhospitably remote locations . <p> The Roman period basilica in Aspendos on Turkey 's southern shore , in the 2nd century CE . <p> The advent of virtual reality technology gives us the chance to use the past work of archaeologists to reconstruct what we 've lost and what we may be rapidly losing . Ancient Palmyra has been irretrievably damaged in the Syrian civil war , but the work of archaeologists at the site is preserved and that means we can even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only be as good as the archaeological work behind them , but the beauty of virtual reconstructions is that they can be forever built on and improved as our knowledge expands . <p> In the early 1900s British archaeologist Arthur Evans controversially chose to physically reconstruct the palace of Knossos on Crete that dates back 3400 years . But his work was heavily criticised because of the materials he used ( such as concrete ) and the interpretations he relied on . <p> Unfortunately for posterity , Evans ' passion for reconstruction has now permanently undermined the authenticity of the site . But for the passionate archaeologists of today , there are no longer such physical risks to reconstructing the past . <p> We will never truly be able to explore ancient Rome or Greece as it was . No technology will ever completely bring the past back , no matter how close we might think we are to understanding it . But reconstructions can pose new questions and lead to new answers .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Big Data projects big things for White Night <p> Algorithms can help us better understand how visitors actually experience Melbourne 's long summer night of art and lights <p> By Dr Christopher Honig , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> It 's the night when Melbourne 's architecture becomes an artist 's canvas . The city opens itself all night to around 500,000 people who swarm the streets , laneways and buildings , taking in live art , spectacular light and projection displays , music , films and installations . <p> One moment , White Night visitors may be enthralled by an enchanted garden . The next , they 're clutching an umbrella , laughing in the Purple Rain . <p> As White Night reaches its five-year milestone in 2017 , is it still going to be novel and interesting to visitors , or will crowds this year be underwhelmed ? <p> After each event , journalists often rush to declare White Night a success or failure and support their arguments with selected subjective accounts from social media . But is there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> My research interest uses data from social media to investigate public culture . Instead of selecting a few choice Instagram images to assess the event , we can download all the public Instagram data beneath the hashtag #WhiteNightMelb , the most commonly used hashtag during White Night . <p> We can then take the captions beneath all these images and run an algorithm , called a ' sentiment analysis ' , to try to determine if each caption is expressing something positive , negative or neutral . <p> For example words like ' happy ' or ' great ' would have a large positive score , where words like ' hate ' or ' terrible ' would give a negative score . In order to understand sentiment , we also need to look at combinations of words within captions . For instance , ' not very happy ' is completely different to ' very happy ' . <p> By adding all these scores together in a given piece of text , our algorithm can guess its sentiment polarity . Of course language is complex and nuanced , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , but still does reasonably well , when we cross-check it manually . The only real problem is sarcasm and irony . Robots take everything literally . <p> The State Library of Victoria . Image : Steve Collis , Flickr <p> Bearing these limitations in mind , we can determine the percentage of image captions that express a ' positive ' sentiment and compare between years . The absolute number of ' positive ' captions is a bit rubbery . We can always change the thresholds on our algorithm . However , when we compare between years we can get an idea of how White Night is tracking . <p> So is White Night getting stale ? Based on our analysis , the answer is no . In fact , the percentage of positive captions about the annual event has increased every year since its inception . So , as far as the average Instagram user is concerned , White Night keeps getting better . <p> The growing positive sentiment of White Night visitors is supported by our analysis of the amount of ground that visitors cover over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch from the National Gallery of Victoria to the Royal Exhibition Building . A round-trip between these two destinations is almost five kilometres . So is it really reasonable to expect that an average audience member walks all this way ? Or has White Night 's audience split into smaller sub-audiences ; do people coming from northern suburbs just go to events at the north end of the city , and vice versa for south siders ? <p> Our analysis can look into this as well , when people geotag their images . For example , if we assume that the order people upload their images to Instagram is the same as the order they attend attractions , we can roughly track how they move through the city . <p> The movements for three users are shown below . Of course we can track many more people than this , to help with crowd management . <p> The movement of three users during White Night 2016 <p> In 2016 , 192 separate users tagged photos at the Royal Exhibition Building and 178 tagged photos at the National Gallery of Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we compare this overlap to other pairs of attractions that are much closer in proximity , like The Royal Exhibition Building and Melbourne Museum or the National Gallery of Victoria and The Arts Centre , we find they 're about the same . <p> We do this analysis a little bit more systematically on all pairs of major attractions and only find a little bit of audience clustering around some northern events , such as the Royal Exhibition Building , Melbourne Museum and City Baths . Otherwise , the Instagram users move between attractions across the city very freely . <p> This implies that distance is n't really a significant factor in the attractions we attend and a lot of people will be walking five kilometres or more over the course of the night . <p> So , visitors to future White Nights will be well advised to wear their most comfortable shoes . <p> Banner image : Josh Muir 's work projected on the National Gallery of Victoria University 's Privacy Officer at **30;59;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> Amazon 's arrival can drive innovation and improvement <p> Local retailers must be responsive to change if they want to stare down the online giant <p> By Professor Colin McLeod , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> We all know that Amazon is coming to Australia , but even though Amazon has yet to announce its plans for an Australian entry , that has n't stopped reactions like ' wreak havoc ' and ' decimation ' . <p> However , even without the details and exact timing of Amazon 's entry to Australia , there are a few things we can be reasonably sure about : <p> 1 . Online retailing is still relatively small in Australia , at around 7% of the total retail market . The suggestion that Amazon will open its own distribution centre in Australia may increase access to a greater range of products ( who has n't had the dreaded ' does not ship to Australia ' message ? ) , but ABS data shows there is little growth in online retailing . Amazon will have some impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online shopping . <p> 2 . Amazon 's biggest impact may be on consumer perceptions . Amazon puts a huge amount of information in the customer 's hands including pricing , product range and independent recommendations , which gives them tremendous bargaining power . Price matching is already a common retail practice , but consumers will increasingly see the ability to get the best price as a given , along with access to greater selection and objective information about products . These dynamics are likely to push revenue down and costs up , even if sales are n't lost to Amazon . <h> How Should Australian Retailers Respond ? <p> Australian retailers may want to think about their ability to reduce Amazon 's advantages while extending their own . There are some areas where Amazon has advantages that are difficult to reduce because they are built into a completely different business model . For example , the timing in Amazon 's cash flow model where they only pay for the product after it is bought by a customer has been estimated as worth billions of dollars a year . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opportunities to close and widen the gap . They are : <h> Customer Information <p> Few companies in the world can match Amazon 's ability to use insights into customer shopping behaviour to manage procurement , stock , staffing , technology deployment and content to create a massive competitive and financial advantage . But now , bricks and mortar retailers are increasingly finding ways to close the information gap . <p> One example is Kepler Analytics , an alumni of the very first intake of companies to the Melbourne Accelerator Program ( MAP ) , the University of Melbourne 's start up incubator . Kepler uses smartphone wireless technology to monitor customer activity in a store and have found there is an ideal ratio of staff to customers that varies between individual stores , even when they are in the same retail group too many staff and wage costs are higher than necessary ; not enough staff and customers leave the store . <p> It 's also about the right staff . For example , if an electronics retailer needs more staff on a Friday night , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phones , home office , games or household electronics ? Kepler can tell them . <p> It 's still a long way from what Amazon can do , but this information has helped produce significant financial improvements . <h> The In-store Experience <p> A couple of years ago , one of the founders of Myagi , a local technology company , was importing a range of technical climbing , skiing and bushwalking products and was surprised to find that despite providing extensive training information , staff in the stores were n't able to explain the product features because the retailers did n't give them any product training . <p> He found several reports from university research centres and industry associations that indicated less than 10% of retail staff get any formal product or customer service training training is ad hoc , unstructured and never tested for retention or comprehension . Many retailers were giving up one of their major advantages the ability of staff to add to the customer in store experience by using their product knowledge to match product to customer needs . <p> In response , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anytime , on any device and it is curated , catalogued and tested . Fast forward three years and , in a presentation to students at the Wade Institute , Myagi 's CEO reported they have venture backing , offices in Silicon Valley and the UK , their revenue is growing exponentially and clients include some of the world 's great brands like Nike , Adidas , Reebok , TaylorMade , Titleist and the world 's largest chain of bicycle retailers . <p> Less than 15% of their revenue comes from Australia , but hopefully local retailers are identifying ways to help their staff effectively manage the customers ' instore experience . <p> An Amazon Fresh truck in San Francisco . Picture : Andrew <h> Growth Strategy and Amazon Fresh <p> One of the most intriguing propositions in Amazon 's proposed entry to Australia is the launch of Amazon Fresh . This is basically an online supermarket , but currently Amazon Fresh is only available in a few US cities and has only recently begun international trials , starting in London . Rolling it out in a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famed Amazon logistics capabilities . <p> Of course , virtual shopping and home delivery for supermarket products is hardly a new thing .

He will send and pay for the order on his phone and can either pick up the order or have it delivered home . <p> Virtual shopping on the Seoul Subway .

While some of the market capitalisation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazon lies in the execution of its retail strategy it is Amazon 's ability to execute that will be tested in the Australian supermarket industry . <h> The New World Customer <p> The reality is that customers are changing and Amazon is a catalyst , not the cause , but the result is that traditional retail models need to adapt to the new world of customers well informed , lots of choices and looking for experiences , not just product transactions . The examples above show that technology may be part of an answer , but technology alone is not the answer . <p> As most responsive to change . It is estimated that in 2016/2017 , leading retailers in the US will permanently close over 1000 stores , and ' failure to adapt ' has become the common explanation . <p> Change will happen regardless of the players in the market .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Time to put tracking numbers on directors <p> It 's easier to become a company director than it is to get a driver 's license , and researchers say it 's time to stop the unscrupulous using phoenix companies that are costing us billions . <p> By Andrew Trounson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> What if someone told you that when your business is struggling and the debts are out of control that you can just shut it down one day and restart the next under a new name debt-free ? Too good to be true ? Not at all . <p> Such " phoenix " activity is costing the Australian economy over a $1 billion a year as unscrupulous directors and their advisers exploit the limited liability company structure to defraud their creditors , leaving suppliers , customers , workers and the tax office out of pocket . <p> The practice is so rife and difficult to prosecute that even when regulators are warned of dodgy phoenix transactions , not enough is being done , says University of Melbourne corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-year investigation by researchers at the University of Melbourne Law School and Monash Business School has made 25 separate recommendations on how to clamp down on phoenix activity , including imposing identity checks on company directors . All directors would have to apply for a Director Identification Number that makes their director histories public , highlighting those directors involved in multiple business failures . <p> " It is hard to believe , but at the moment it is more difficult to obtain a driver 's license or a bank account than it is to become a company director there are no identity or background checks , " says Professor Anderson who led the study . <p> It means it is difficult for the regulators to identify potentially dodgy directors with a history of business failures , making it easy for them to cover their tracks by simply falsifying their names or birth dates . <p> " The situation is causing terrible pain . Not only are small traders and consumers suffering significant financial damage as debts are not repaid and deposits are lost , but as a law abiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy , " she says . <h> Making information freely available <p> " Dodgy directors are going under the radar where the regulators ca n't join the dots . An identification number aims to address this by making it easier for ASIC and the ATO , as well as the public themselves , to identify potential . And if people know they were being better tracked then they might think twice before undertaking phoenix activity , " Professor Anderson says . <p> Other key recommendations include that the regulator , the Australian Securities and Investment Commission , scrap the fees it charges for the public to search its company databases in order to encourage more transparency . It recommends that ASIC create a public register of disqualified directors and that ASIC make monitoring phoenix activity a higher priority . <p> There are also recommendations to increase the penalties for breaches of director 's duties which occur where there is deliberate liquidation of companies . It recommends the maximum civil penalty for breaching director 's duties be increased from $200,000 per offence to $500,000 , while penalties for criminal breaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when a business is wound up or abandoned , only for a new company carrying on the same business to be created by the same people or their associates . It is n't necessarily illegal and can be a legitimate way to rescue a business . But Professor Anderson says it becomes problematic when inept entrepreneurs are repeatedly failing and leaving creditors unpaid . It becomes illegal when people shut down businesses to intentionally defraud their creditors . It is these defrauders and the inept entrepreneurs that Professor Anderson and her colleagues want to target . <p> Free access to information on directors would empower the public themselves to identify potential . Picture : Pexels <p> Professor Anderson says it is understandable that ASIC is struggling to enforce the law given it is receiving about 20,000 reports of misconduct each year from liquidators , and proving an intention to defraud is difficult . But she says one way around this is to give free access to ASIC databases that would empower the public to identify dodgy directors themselves . <p> " Phoenix is n't a problem that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than cure . We need to make it easier for people to do their own research . The casual will then have to be more wary of getting caught . " <p> " The DIN and improved information access wo n't stamp out complex illegal phoenix activity , but it will disrupt the practice and deter it , " she says . " At the moment think they are invisible . This is a way of shining a light on them . The United Kingdom can provide company and director information for free . Why ca n't we ? " <h> Cost of inaction <p> Making ASIC information free would cut into government revenue , but Professor Anderson argues that the cost is dwarfed by what phoenix activity is costing the country . She notes that ASIC runs at profit , earning around $850 million on a cost base of about $350 million a year , but points out that in 2012 PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated the cost of phoenix activity at $1.78 billion a year . <p> The Australian Taxation Office itself has estimated the cost at between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Productivity Commission there are 2,000-3,000 instances of phoenix activity every year . <p> As part of the research Professor Anderson and her co-researchers carried out interviews across business and government , talking to regulators , the police , government , liquidators , credit managers , business people and even the advisors who spruik phoenix activity to their clients . She says the temptation for people to absolve themselves of their debts by simply closing down and starting again is so alluring that it is in danger of becoming an accepted practice . She says there are already businesses out there that price their goods and services on the basis that they wo n't be paying tax , effectively undercutting legitimate businesses . <p> " The opportunity to remove yourself from all your debt obligations by simply closing your company and starting a new one with no real consequences is just irresistible for some people , " she says . <h> Danger of going mainstream <p> " My big fear is that if we do n't do more to stop phoenix activity , it will become so endemic that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just another accepted part of doing business and people will just shrug their shoulders and say ' do n't blame me , blame the system . ' We need to fix the system while we still can . " <p> Over twenty years ago , the Victorian Law Reform Committee concluded that " the problem of the phoenix company is common and perhaps endemic " and it should " not be ignored " . Yet the researchers point out that recent estimates of the economic cost of phoenix activity suggest that it 's still as rampant as ever . <p> Professor Anderson says a key reason why it is so difficult to stop phoenix activity is because closing down a failed business and allowing an entrepreneur to try again is perfectly legitimate . The challenge she says is to allow such legitimate business failures while stopping phoenix activity that involves intentional fraud . It is for this reason that the researchers are recommending the creation of a new " restricted " category of director . It would be slapped on those directors that have been involved in five business failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " directors would be listed in a public database and would face increased regulatory scrutiny . <p> " We do n't want to penalise people running limited liability companies unless they 've done something wrong . Going into business involves some risk and we need to provide entrepreneurs with some protection . But we need to be able to identify and take action on the serial failures out there , whether people are doing it deliberately or not . " <p> The researchers also recommend that the government clarify the role and funding of liquidators who have a statutory duty to report to ASIC on business collapses . Professor Anderson says at the moment , because liquidators are only paid from any funds realised when a business collapses , they have no means to thoroughly investigate collapses where there is no prospect of being paid for their work . <p> The project produced three reports in all the first profiled phoenix activity , the second quantified phoenix activity , and the third sets out recommendations for curbing phoenix activity . <p> The research team includes Professor Helen Anderson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michelle Welsh from the Monash Business School , and research fellow Jasper Hedges from the Melbourne Law School .

But many will brace for the mist of chemically fragranced droplets sent floating over us -- chemicals that are making people sick . <p> New research from the University of Melbourne shows that one in three Australians report health problems , including migraine headaches and asthma attacks , when they are exposed to common fragranced consumer products such as air fresheners , cleaning products , laundry supplies , and personal care products . <p> The Australian-first research found that based on a nationally representative population survey using a random sample of 1098 people , some 33 per cent reported health problems such as migraine headaches , asthma attacks , rashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . <p> Fragrances contained in air fresheners , detergents and personal care products can contain hazardous chemicals , but there are no requirements to disclose on the label what makes up the smell we are smelling . Picture : Shutterstock <p> The research was conducted by Anne Steinemann , Professor of Civil Engineering and Chair of Sustainable Cities at the University of Melbourne School of Engineering , using a large , web-based panel held by Survey Sampling International . The results have been published in the journal Preventive Medicine Reports . <p> Professor Steinemann is a world expert on environmental pollutants , air quality , and health effects . <p> " This is an epidemic . Fragranced products are creating health problems and the effects can be immediate , severe and potentially disabling , " Professor Steinemann says . <p> " It 's also resulting in lost workdays and jobs , and restricted access in society , " she says . <p> Her study found 7.7 per cent of Australians said they had lost workdays or a job in the past year due to illness caused by fragranced products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unable to use a public toilet if there is an air freshener . <p> Professor Steinemann 's research has found that common fragranced products including air fresheners , laundry products , cleaners and personal care products including soap and shampoo can both contain hazardous pollutants and generate hazardous pollutants , such as formaldehyde and potential carcinogens , through chemical reactions with ozone in normal use . <p> Professor Steinemann says there is also an issue when it comes to involuntary exposure to these fragranced products . <p> " I call it the problem of second-hand scents , " she says . <p> " It has parallels with second-hand tobacco smoke but it 's much more complicated because fragrance is everywhere , in so many products . " <p> It is not the first time Professor Steinemann 's research has found that people say they have fallen i 'll after exposure to common fragranced products . <p> The results of her Australian study mirrored those from similar research she conducted in the United States in 2016 , where 34.7 per cent of Americans say they experienced health problems when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted in two different countries found remarkably similar results , " Professor Steinemann says . " I 'm now doing the same study in the UK and seeing similar figures . " <p> Professor Steinemann says there are no regulatory requirements that all the ingredients in a fragranced consumer product be disclosed on the product label or safety data sheet . <p> Almost half of Australians are not aware that a ' fragrance ' in a product is typically a chemical mixture of several dozen to several hundred chemicals , according to her study . But none of these chemicals in a ' fragrance ' mixture need to be disclosed . <p> Many people use fragranced products in the belief that they are improving air quality . Professor Steinemann says the opposite is true . <p> " A fragrance in a product is not intended to clean the air or reduce air pollutants . In fact , fragranced products emit a complex mixture of chemical pollutants , so the air quality is actually worse . " <p> She says people who try to avoid risks by choosing products labelled green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " My previous research has shown that that all types of fragranced products -- even ones called ' green , ' ' organic , ' and ' all-natural ' emitted hazardous air pollutants , " she says . Emissions of carcinogenic hazardous air pollutants from ' green ' fragranced products were not significantly different from regular fragranced products . <p> Professor Steinemann is currently conducting research to understand which types of chemicals in fragranced products are associated with the health problems . <p> She notes that many workplaces and schools now have fragrance-free policies , including the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the US , which has banned the use of all scented or fragranced products in any of its buildings . <p> Professor Steinemann says there are simple and cost-effective alternatives for people wanting to improve the air in their home and workplace . <p> " You can open windows for fresh air , use products without any kind of fragrance , and switch to the sorts of things our grandparents used , like vinegar and bicarb University 's Privacy Officer at **30;503;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> iVote West Australia : Who voted for you ? <p> Voters casting their ballot online must be able to trust the process . In a world where hackers have been accused of interfering in elections , iVote is not the answer <p> By Dr Chris Culnane , University of Melbourne ; Mark Eldridge , University of Adelaide ; Dr Aleksander Essex , Western University , Canada ; Dr Vanessa Teague , University of Melbourne ; Dr Yuval Yarom , University of Adelaide . <p> Share selection to : <p> In the 2017 Western Australian state election , voters with disabilities can register and vote over the Internet for the first time , using a system called iVote . Voters with disabilities deserve to have just as much confidence in the privacy and security of their votes as able-bodied voters using a polling booth . Unfortunately , a breach of voter privacy , or overt tampering of ballots , may not be noticed if it happens online and reading or altering someone 's iVote might be easier than it seems . <p> Security vulnerabilities are successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extract government secrets . US intelligence agencies blamed Russian government hackers for interfering in the US election . <p> The iVote registration and voting servers are protected by Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) , the Internet 's most common security protocol . If you visit your bank and click on the padlock in your browser 's address bar , you can see a TLS certificate that proves you are communicating with the true owner of that domain . However , if you visit the WA Electoral Commission 's online registration page or the iVote log-in page and click on that padlock , you see something surprising : the TLS certificate is owned not by the WA Electoral Commission ( WAEC ) but by a US company called Incapsula . <p> The iVote log-in page <p> Incapsula provides protection against Distributed Denial of Service ( DDoS ) attacks , by placing itself between voters and the actual . This is known as a ' proxy ' . <p> It means that registration information of WA voters is sent to an Incapsula server based in the US ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of Incapsula 's servers to read it . ( We are not eligible to register , so we do n't know whether Medicare and passport numbers of voters are also sent there . ) <p> This is not a question of Incapsula being dishonest : possible eavesdroppers include Incapsula employees , contractors , hackers who may have compromised Incapsula 's systems , and the US Government itself . Incapsula 's competitor , Cloudflare , was recently affected by a serious security problem which leaked passwords , secret keys , intimate photos and other private data . <p> iVote aims to provide a secret ballot by separating the registration server ( which knows your identity ) from the voting server ( which can learn how you voted ) . Unfortunately , the use of Incapsula to proxy voter connections destroys this separation . If you register and vote from the same web browser , a ' cookie ' stored on your system by Incapsula allows it to link both interactions . <p> iVote ballots are encrypted using code provided by the voting server ( **29;58;TOOLONG ) . Our tests showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not WA . The encryption is only as trustworthy as the server providing the code . Anyone with access to Incapsula 's systems , or the NSW server , could manipulate this encryption code before it reaches the voter , allowing them to read or modify votes before they are returned to the voting server . <p> Indeed , actively modifying the code may not be necessary for a server that knows registration information . iVote stores partial votes on the voting server knowing a voter 's PIN might make it significantly easier to guess their I 'd number and hence decrypt their vote . Since we are not eligible to use iVote , we have not been able to confirm whether this is feasible . <p> This is a question of trust . The WA Electoral Commission ( WAEC ) has assured voters that their votes are " completely secret " and " can not be tampered with or changed " . Unfortunately , the commission can not ensure that either of these statements is true , especially if the connections are proxied through a third party . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , iVote is not a verifiable voting system . The telephone-based vote-reading service does not give voters any genuine evidence that their votes are properly recorded and included in the count , nor does iVote give scrutineers any meaningful opportunity to verify that votes have been properly processed . <p> The last time iVote was used for a state election ( NSW 2015 ) , there was at least one serious security vulnerability . There is no evidence that it was exploited to manipulate votes -- but also no evidence that it was not . This is the key problem with the use of online voting systems such as iVote : the verification protocol does not guarantee that errors or fraud will be detected . <p> After the 2015 election , the NSW Electoral Commission claimed that " 1.7% of electors who voted using iVote also used the verification service and none of them identified any anomalies with their vote " . However , more than a year after the election , it emerged that 627 calls to the verification service failed to retrieve any vote at all -- a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether these errors were caused by voter error , software bugs or deliberate manipulation . All we know is that the system is n't verifiable , because an indication of a serious problem does not seem to have been noticed or mentioned to scrutineers at the time . <h> A Better Solution <p> Secure , private and verifiable online voting remains an unsolved problem . Online voting involves a unique challenge to keep votes anonymous while producing evidence of a correct outcome which is not found in other systems such as online banking . <p> There is no suggestion that any of the parties described in this article would act maliciously . However , when dealing with security , it is the risk that matters . Using a proxy such as Incapsula simply adds to a list of parties who may have the ability to read or modify iVote ballots without being detected . The software vendor ( Scytl ) , or attackers with access to their systems , could add malicious code to the iVote system which would be very hard to detect . Those with ( legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host server might also be able to modify the code , as could anyone who controlled the voter 's computer . <p> The WA Electoral Commission has built up well-deserved trust among WA voters and candidates over many years , but this trust does not automatically transfer to others . Scrutineers have no meaningful way of verifying iVote 's output . Scrutineers based in WA will not even be able to see the iVote server in Sydney that receives WA votes from the United States . <p> Paper-based voting , crucially , is beyond the reach of a remote cyber attacker such as a foreign government . We strongly recommend that the WA Electoral Commission discontinue the use of iVote for future WA state elections , and reintroduce , a polling-place system that allowed voters to verify a printed paper record of their vote . <p> Secure e-voting can work in the privacy of the polling booth , using a paper record so that voters can verify their vote matches their intention .

This meant that anyone who could find the internet address of the voting server could potentially DDoS it directly , bypassing Incapsula entirely . The specific DDoS advice appears to have been followed , so the server is now much better defended . The trust issues University 's Privacy Officer at **30;89;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> Narrow training sells students short <p> The crisis in Australia 's training sector means TAFEs need to develop their own courses tailored to an unpredictable future <p> By Andrew Trounson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Vocational education is traditionally supposed to train people in the skills they need for specific jobs , but what happens in a fast-changing world when those jobs disappear and we ca n't even know for sure what the future jobs will be ? <p> According to Associate Professor Leesa Wheelahan , an international vocational education and training expert , Australia 's narrow focus on specific work place skills is short-changing students and is a key reason why our scandal-ridden training sector is in crisis . <p> In a startling statistic , she points out that last year a full two-thirds of vocational education and training graduates were working in occupations that were n't directly associated with their qualification . Associate Professor Wheelahan says it is a clear signal Australia 's market-driven training system , in which private and public providers compete for funding to deliver off-the-shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> TAFE courses need to be broader if they are to better prepare students for future workforce needs . Picture : The Edge Foundation/Flickr <p> " What is the point of tying training to workplace tasks and roles when graduates do n't work in those roles ? It means the first objective of VET , which is to align with the needs of the workplace , simply is n't being met , " Associate Professor Wheelahan , the William G. Davis Chair in Community College Leadership at the University of Toronto , told a recent seminar at the Melbourne Graduate School of Education . <p> An expert on the Australian system and an honorary senior fellow at the University of Melbourne 's LH Martin Institute , Associate Professor Wheelahan said Australia 's VET sector was " broken . " Trust had been undermined , she said , noting that last year the Commonwealth 's own Education Department had admitted to a Senate committee that one-third of new VET students who had obtained student loans were n't getting a quality education . <p> " The point of VET is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create nationally trusted qualifications and to do that we need strong institutions that can create and deliver these qualifications , " Professor Wheelahan said . <p> She argued that the solution is to refocus funding away from the private sector and invest more in publicly-funded TAFEs , which she said are among the only institutions with the capacity to develop their own courses , as universities do , that can be better tailored to future workforce needs . <p> Associate Professor Wheelahan said current training courses focused on narrow competency based training that educates workers for largely routine and supervised roles , rather than training them to be proactive and versatile . She said the system is wasteful and expensive as it leads to thousands of different qualifications , many of which only attract handful of students . Unbelievably , she said over half the publicly funded VET courses in Australia each attract less than 50 students a year . <p> " Competency based training fragments knowledge and skills and provides students only with access to specific applications of knowledge , leading to an emphasis on procedural knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refocus on enhancing the capabilities of students by developing courses attuned to broader fields rather than narrow occupations . For example rather that having specific courses in aged care , disability care and drug and alcohol care , students should do training in care work more broadly , equipping them to move easily between areas . <p> Many VET courses currently only attract a small number of students . Picture : Pexels <p> " What we need are vocational streams linked to occupations that share common vocational practices and knowledge that can allow graduates to move around occupations , " she said . " The teachers of electrical trade apprentices should be thinking about what the latest insights in engineering mean for the way electrical trade work will change in five years time . " <p> She said the Canadian province of Ontario had a strong and trusted network of vocational colleges partly because the colleges have responsibility for developing their own courses , in consultation with business , local communities and professional accreditation bodies . <p> " We need qualifications that are based on minimum standards , but beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can then be accredited by professional bodies or by industry . " <p> Associate Professor Wheelahan says a move could force about 2,000 small private providers out of the system " overnight " because only large providers like TAFE would have the capability to produce their own trusted courses that the sector now needs . " That would be a good thing . ' ' <p> She said the policy push nationwide to open up public VET funding to the market had " decimated " TAFE and led to massive government funding cuts . <p> Associate Professor Wheelahan pointed out that real government recurrent expenditure on actual per student teaching hours in VET fell by a massive 31.5 per cent between 2005 and 2014 . Over a similar period , total government spending on VET had been almost flat at $6.3 billion a year , when spending on schools had risen from $33 billon to $41 billion , and spending on universities had rise from $16.5 billion to $23.4 billion . <p> " Vocational education is the only sector of education in which funding cuts are regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Just imagine if these cuts had been imposed on the schools sector or the higher education sector ? There would have been uproar . " <p> She noted that since 2009 , TAFE 's share of the student market across the country had fallen from over 80 per cent to just 50 per cent , while the share of private providers had soared from less than 15 per cent to almost 46 per cent . <p> Speaking at the seminar , LH Martin Institute Director , Professor Leo Goedegebuure , backed Professor Wheelahan 's call for Australia 's VET policy to refocus more on TAFE and to give them more power to develop their own qualifications . <p> " The only thing that is going to work when the future is unpredictable and involves enormous change , is having strong autonomous institutions , " he said . <p> Professor Goedegebuure said there was overwhelming evidence that open markets simply do n't work in education and that the push to marketising VET had been driven by ideology rather than evidence . <p> " For a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a role as the regulator of the market , and that has been absent 's Privacy Officer at **30;0;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> The challenge and opportunity of an ageing workforce <p> For the first time in history , we have four generations working together . We need to make the most of it . <p> By Professor Peter Gahan and Dr Joshua Healy , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> The UN estimates that by 2050 , one in three people living in the developed world will be over 60 . In Australia , one in four people is older than 55 and over the next decade this will increase to approximately one in three . As our demography continues to shift , a key imperative will be to prolong paid workforce participation and reduce the dependence of the non-working population on the working population to a manageable level . <p> Ageing workforce rhetoric has widely discussed policy implications the cost of healthcare , and impacts on the social welfare system , retirement savings and the broader economy but important aspects of the ageing workforce have as yet been largely omitted . <p> Providing opportunities for different generations to work together will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Shutterstock <p> As our working population gets older , government , industry , families and individuals will feel the pressure . But if we can deal with the issue constructively the pay offs will be big reduced social welfare obligation , higher organisational productivity through the retention of skilled workers and greater personal fulfilment for older workers . The onus is on organisations , business leaders , colleagues and older individuals facing a longer stint in the labour market . <p> Human roles and functions are changing with the advancement of new technology , so experienced employees of any age will be required to re-skill or up-skill . Older employees face the added challenge of social bias and stereotyping , as well as potentially deteriorating health and family expectations . <p> Different experiences and outlooks could give rise to increased interpersonal conflicts at work . Our research looks at how we manage this . The first step is understanding attitudes towards older workers and the second is investigating how we shape these attitudes . <p> International research shows that attitudes are based on stereotypes -- older workers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less adaptable to change . These , like many stereotypes , are inaccurate . In fact , even the definition of what constitutes an older worker is unclear , with definitions ranging from over 40 to over 60 . <p> Older workers often also hold these stereotypes themselves , compounding to negatively impact workplace participation and creating a culture of division . <p> People who think of themselves as old are more likely to leave the workforce . Picture : <p> This bias exists in the selection and recruitment process , resulting in barriers to entry for older people . According to the Australian Human Rights Commission , over one quarter of Australians over 50 experienced some form of age discrimination in the previous two years and four in 10 organisations admit they would n't employ someone over 65 . People who think of themselves as old are more likely to leave the workforce . <p> Age is more complicated than chronological years .

In reality , most wo n't be able to afford to retire until eligible for the age pension receipt of which will likely continue to be delayed over the coming years . We need to face the reality that working life , for most of us , will be a lot longer than we expected . <p> It 's becoming harder for many older people to live out their retirement dreams . Picture : Unsplash <p> As automation and new technology change the way we work and even the places in which we work , we need to reframe how we think about our careers and our role within a company . We may need to combine study and work or move sideways in our careers . This brings with it the potential for a more varied career but that requires adapting to a new vision of success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- full-time and part-time options , flexible hours and operating conditions are required . <p> Another consideration which is often overlooked is the fact that early retirement may not be a dream scenario for everyone . There are significant health and wellbeing benefits to staying actively involved in the workforce so we need to enable those who can and want to continue working to do so . <h> Adaptation and productivity <p> According to the Intergenerational Report , Australians are living longer lives but they are also healthier for longer . However , the majority of Australians have a less than 50 per cent chance of still working between the ages of 60 and 74 . <p> A homogenous approach to health and wellbeing practices just does n't cut it . The effects of ageing differ greatly from person to person ; we ca n't make assumptions about physical capability based on age . <p> If a worker can no longer fulfil the requirements of their job , the role should be tailored to ensure the knowledge and expertise of the older worker is retained . Organisations need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment without demanding too much of those who are either unable to work into their later years or are trained to perform roles involving daily tasks that compromise their own wellbeing , or may put others at risk . <p> On the other hand poor health may mean retirement is the only option for some . We need to be financially prepared for this by consciously managing our super and other savings from a younger age . Policymakers may need to consider variable age pension options . <p> There are also social implications to remaining in the workforce longer and families will need to adapt . According to the Melbourne Institute 's Household , Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia ( HILDA ) Survey , as the cost of childcare increases , families are relying more heavily on grandparents as carers . Nearly one-quarter of couples with children under 13 have grandparents care for their children for approximately 15 hours per week . <p> There are significant policy considerations , but organisations and employees also need to take responsibility and play their role in the University 's Privacy Officer at **30;2289;TOOLONG

Will the Netherlands elect the man many refer to as ' the Dutch Donald Trump ' ? Here are four things you need to know before this week 's election . <p> 1 . An anti-Islam and anti-EU politician is changing Dutch politics <p> The similarities between Geert Wilders and US President Donald Trump extend further than their trademark blonde hair . Wilders ' outspoken views have easily made him the most recognised and polarising political figure from the Netherlands . <p> The Dutch public has been wary of EU migration policies during the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis and Wilders ' promises to ' de-Islamise ' the Netherlands by banning Muslim immigration , closing mosques and outlawing the Koran has hit a chord with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a similarly anti-establishment , anti-Islam agenda to that of Donald Trump . This campaign video was released in February 2017 . <p> Wilders was first elected as an MP for the ruling VDD party in 1998 , but a disagreement over the party 's support of Turkey 's entry to the EU resulted in him leaving the party and establishing the anti-Islam , anti-EU , anti-immigration Party for Freedom ( PVV ) in 2002 . <p> Officially , Wilders is the only member of the PVV , but since the 2006 elections the party has had a spectacular rise in popularity by feeding a public appetite against Islam and multiculturalism . <p> Wilders has even looked to Australian policy on asylum seekers , praising its tough stance on those who seek to reach Australia by boat . <p> If the PVV emerges as the Netherlands ' largest party after the election , it will be a remarkable triumph for the far-Right in a country previously renowned for tolerance . <p> 3 . But he probably wo n't be able to form a Government <p> It 's extremely rare in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to form a majority , so forming a coalition is a necessary feature in Dutch politics . <p> After the election , possible coalition scenarios will be assessed and they likely wo n't include the PVV . After years of disrespecting parliamentary conventions and using foul language towards other MPs , Wilders has very few friends inside the House . <p> Dutch Prime Minister and Leader of the VDD Mark Rutte poses for a selfie in The Hague on March 12 , 2017 . Picture : Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images . <p> The Dutch Prime Minister , Mark Rutte , who leads the VDD party , has already ruled out forming a coalition with Wilders , and so have most other parties . <p> Regardless of the results , coalition building takes time and assuming the PVV takes over 20 seats , it could take five or more parties to form a government . <p> 4 . The result may set the tone for the other European elections . <p> EU pundits will be reading the tea leaves on what a populist win or loss in the Netherlands will imply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Since the 1990s , certain election trends in Europe have been noted , such as lower voter turnout , decline in loyalty to establishment parties and the increasing voice of smaller , populist parties . These trends match current political developments in the Netherlands . <p> But even before the first vote is cast , there are already winners and losers among players in European politics . Populist parties and movements , both on the Right and Left , are achieving their intention of disrupting the status quo by fragmenting the political system and increasing dissatisfaction and polarisation . <p> This has already been the case in Greece and Spain where parties were unable to form coalitions and effectively govern , but populist candidates are also influencing a change in positions of establishment parties , such as the VDD 's new stance on migration and the campaign tone of Prime Minister Rutte , who is now matching some of Wilders ' anti-immigration rhetoric . <p> Centre-Right parties have a chance to do well this year if they can peel off support from the far-right , but traditional parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two Right-wing parties to lead in the polls in the Netherlands and the Labour Party is struggling to maintain party loyalty , even losing the support of voters with a migrant background , part of their traditional base .

 <h> Dutch election results are the opposite of Trump-like populism <p> The Dutch elections have produced a bittersweet victory for centre-right incumbent Prime Minister Mark Rutte and his VVD Party . <p> With over 90 per cent of the vote counted , it 's clear the VVD will become the biggest party with a significant lead : potentially 33 seats out of 150 . It 's likely that the threat of major gains for the Party for Freedom ( PVV ) the party of anti-Islam , anti-European Union Geert Wilders - helped consolidate votes for the Prime Minister . <p> Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was all smiles as it became clear his ruling VDD party would triumph at the polls . Picture : Carl Court/Getty <p> But Rutte 's apparent victory is also a loss , because the VVD is eight seats down from the previous election .

The party is likely to become the second biggest , growing from 15 to 20 seats . <p> With his outspoken views , and a haircut and a Twitter repertoire reminiscent of US President Donald Trump , Wilders dominated much of the international news coverage during the campaign . But we now know this election has not produced his rise to power . <p> Wilders has been a steady force in Dutch politics for over a decade . His party is a major player , but with all other parties turning their back on the Party for Freedom , it is very unlikely Wilders will have his hand anywhere near the levers of power . <p> Geert Wilders ' Party for Freedom did not cause the upset some commentators anticipated in the 2017 Dutch election .

It will be a government of compromise and middle ground . A government that will implement policies after endless multi-party consultations . A government that may take until Christmas to even be formed . <p> The collapse of the famous Dutch system of polarised politics has finally come to a head . The big political streams of liberalism , social-democracy and Christian-democracy have disintegrated . The three pillars that used to make up the entire mainstream political spectrum now have about 60 out of the 150 seats .

A wide diversity of issues and perspectives prevailed in the campaign . <p> In fact , organising debates with ten or more party leaders started to become a political challenge . A dazzling diversity of issues was debated : hard-line Turkish populism and anti-racism slogans ; earthquakes in the gas fields of the north ; leftist calls for animal rights ; ground-breaking tax reforms driven by ecological ambitions ; nationalist calls to reintroduce singing the national anthem at elementary schools ; and calls for further expanding the laws on euthanasia .

With the Christian Union ( a likely five seats ) , such a coalition would just have the necessary numbers by the latest count , but a one-seat margin is hardly a solid basis for government in country where renegade factions have become a normal part of politics . <p> Forming a coalition government is business-as-usual in the Netherlands , but negotiations are likely to be particularly complicated this year .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> New test to improve blood cancer treatment <p> A simple blood test is set to replace painful , invasive biopsies for blood cancer patients <p> By Catriona May , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> For blood cancer patients , tissue biopsies are yet another unpleasant part of their treatment cycle . The invasive procedure , which requires sedation , pain relief and at least six hours in hospital , is used for diagnosis and to track the progress of treatment , and is done up to three times a year . <p> But from late 2017 , the 12,000 Australians diagnosed every year with blood cancers like leukaemia may no longer need to undergo such frequent biopsies . A simple blood test will be able to monitor their progress instead . <p> Doctors will be able to monitor the progress of blood cancer treatments using a simple blood test , instead of invasive tissue biopsies , thanks to new technology developed at the Peter MacCallum Centre Centre and the University of Melbourne . Picture : Wellcome Images / Flickr <p> The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyses trace amounts of cancer DNA found in patients ' blood . Based on research published in both Nature Communications and Blood , it is the result of ten years of work by Associate Professor Sarah Jane Dawson , who is based at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and the University of Melbourne . It builds on her earlier work at the University of Cambridge , where she discovered the potential of analysing cell-free DNA for treating solid malignancies , particularly breast cancer . <p> " Most cancers shed small amounts of DNA into the bloodstream , " explains Associate Professor Dawson . " This is not present in the cellular constituents of blood , and is known as cell-free DNA . We have developed technology that enables us to isolate it , and then analyse it for cancer-causing mutations . " <p> All the patient has to do is provide a simple blood sample . The liquid biopsy , or circulating tumour DNA test ( ctDNA test ) , is then conducted in the lab . Clinicians will take the test at the point of diagnosis , to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a baseline measurement that can then be tracked through treatment . <p> " As well as being less invasive , the test may give clinicians more precise information than current biopsies on the cancer 's response to treatment , " says Associate Professor Dawson . " So we can very nimbly act on what we learn -- if , for example , a patient relapses or fails to respond to a particular therapy , we can adjust their treatment accordingly . " <p> But , traditional tissue biopsies will remain important at the point of diagnosis . <p> " The new test is not a substitute for a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy at the point of diagnosis , " says Associate Professor Dawson . <p> " It is still important to see the cancer cells down the microscope to diagnose a patient 's condition . However , the new test does mean we can reduce the number of biopsies a patient experiences through their treatment , and we can also provide more effective treatment , based on the information it provides . " <p> Because single tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a select few cells from the cancer to be examined , they ca n't provide a complete picture of the whole tumour . The new test will help provide a more holistic picture of what is happening . <p> " The results of the new test are more precise because cancer cells from all disease sites within the body shed their DNA into the bloodstream , providing a much more complete picture of the state of the tumour , " says Associate Professor Dawson . <p> Associate Professor Dawson has already developed circulating tumour DNA tests for breast and other cancer types , which now guide the treatment of some 500 patients in her research program at Peter Mac . Since publishing her initial findings in the New England Journal of Medicine and Naturein 2013 , she has expanded her work on cell-free DNA into other cancers including melanoma , lung cancer and now blood cancers . <p> The team are optimistic the circulating tumour DNA test for blood cancers will transition into the clinical arena in 2017 . <p> " We want to see this become a useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From late 2017 we will be offering this as a diagnostic service for patients around the country .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> The creeping influence of lobbyists in Washington <p> Rather than " draining the swamp " , the Trump administration is opening the White House 's doors to corporate interests <p> By George Rennie , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> When Donald Trump ran for President , his message was simple : if elected , he would " fix " healthcare , ban the " bad guys " , build a wall and drain a swamp . <p> Since occupying the Oval Office , however , it has become apparent that these things are n't so easy to do . <p> In Trump 's mind , " nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated " , and he is slowly realising that the cost of the border wall with Mexico will cost many multiples of the $8 billion he once suggested . He has also found that attempts to " ban Muslims " ( a phrase Trump now carefully avoids ) have been thwarted by " so-called judges " . <p> But his promise to " drain the swamp " has presented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamp " is a term often used by politicians , and refers to the deleterious impact of lobbying on US politics . Trump made a big deal of it : suggesting that , as a billionaire , he was impervious to special interests ( and implied his team would be too ) . Many Americans , desperate to rid themselves of the albatross of lobbying and corporate welfare , embraced him for it . <p> Yet , rather than tackling this critical issue , he has done the opposite . The Washingtonian swamp is getting bigger , and it the mosquitos that habituate it now occupy the White House . <h> Trump 's Revolving Door <p> When Trump took office , one of his first acts purported to extend -- and even enhance the Obama era ban on executive lobbying . <p> The new restrictions prevent members of his executive from ever lobbying for foreign governments after leaving their positions , and prohibits them from taking positions as professional lobbyists for five years domestically . <p> However , the move is a red herring : the executive order actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former lobbyists can join the administration more readily . <p> Also , while the executive order will prevent Trump 's cabinet from lobbying for positions in companies directly tied to their portfolios for five years , it only prevents them from taking other positions in those companies for two . Thus , the " revolving door " of politics has been slowed , but not stopped . <p> Once two years are up , there is nothing to stop them from taking up positions that pay millions of dollars in salary ( as many in Washington now do , where between a third and half of ex-congressmen , senators , White House officials , and key staffers go on to work as lobbyists ) . <h> Trump 's Gilded Cabinet <p> These problems are compounded , however , by the actual makeup of Trump 's cabinet , which reads like the roster of a lobbyist 's dream team . <p> Take , for instance , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , Scott Pruitt , who was substantially funded by the oil and gas industry throughout his political career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position as a means of pressuring the very organisation Pruitt now heads . <p> In this arrangement , the oil lobby would write a letter , and Pruitt would send it -- unaltered , except for his signature on the letterhead of the Oklahoma Attorney General . <p> Pruitt 's example is typical in Trump 's cabinet . It is normal for Republican administrations to have a pro-business ideology , but the problem is the extent to which so many of them have significant ties to the industries they are now tasked with overseeing . <p> Only by viewing Trump 's appointments as designed to appeal to , rather than rebuke , the role of lobbyists do his decisions make sense . <p> Viewed in this way , who better than former bankers to oversee the economy than the Secretaries of Treasury , Labor and Commerce ? Who better to run Health than a politician whose biggest donors were healthcare companies , and whose Chief of Staff was a long-time lobbyist for the industry ? And who better to run the Department of Education than Betsy DeVos , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America 's schooling system ? And why not have a former executive from Boeing , one the most aggressive lobbyists of Trump since inauguration , and a key beneficiary of his budget , as deputy Secretary of Defense ? <p> The Trump administration is attempting to paint this as part of a pro-business strategy , but it is a distortion . The problem is not that the corporations are represented in cabinet , it is the types of corporations that are : the companies and industries that are most reliant on government contracts and excessive " corporate welfare " ( such as defense and healthcare ) , or those that are most vulnerable to regulations ( such as oil and gas , and banking ) are well represented in Trump 's cabinet . <p> But it 's often a zero sum game : other businesses lose out , as do non-corporate and environmental interests . <h> Trump 's Treasure Chest <p> The conflicts of interest in the Trump administration are legion , but it is those of the President himself that are of the greatest concern . <p> Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position to spruik his development projects , and since assuming office , he and his team have repeatedly advertised his businesses and those of his family . <p> Perhaps the most glaring example of this can be found at the so-called " Winter White House " , Mar-a-Lago or one of his golf courses , which Trump has used in lieu of Camp David or the White House . Since then demand for memberships spiked and fees doubled . The profits go to Trump . <p> The circumstances of this arrangement have proven galling . When Japan 's Prime Minister made a state visit to the United States , the media was excluded from watching Trump and Abe golf , presumably so the two could discuss sensitive matters in private . <p> Yet when North Korea again rattled its nuclear sabre , Trump insisted that the crisis talks occur in his club dining room .

This shop too was closed . I began to call all barbershops , hairdressers and beauty schools in the area , only to be met with friendly Danish voicemail messages . <p> Slightly confused , I returned to my friend 's apartment where I shared with him my experience .

Sweden ( 7.284 ) <p> Source : World Happiness Report 2017 <p> First released in 2012 , the WHR combines a mixture of quantitative and qualitative measures to give an overall ranking of ' Happiness ' . These include the experience of care , freedom , generosity , honesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The WHR considers trust in government , GDP per capita , freedom from corruption , the sense of having someone to count on and incidence of mental health to all be of equal importance . <h> No coincidence <p> The fact that 4 out of the top 5 happiest countries are Nordic countries stands out to even the most casual reader . This is no accident or coincidence . The Nordic countries value equality and have invested ( both politically and economically ) in building more equal societies . They also retain the highest levels of union membership by a significant margin , and have some of the strongest collective bargaining systems in the world . The Nordic countries lead the world in trust in government , gender equity and freedom from corruption . <p> When we look at the Gini coefficient ( a measure of income inequality from 0 to 100 , where 0 is perfect equality ) the Nordic countries average 27.26 compared to Australia 's 34.9 . Indeed , by comparison Australia consistently underperforms the Nordic region , not only in happiness and income equality , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These impressive scores did n't happen overnight . In most of the Nordic countries , between the 1940s and the 1990s the region as a whole experienced a democratic dominance of left-wing governments , particularly the Swedish social democratic Party ( SAP ) , which governed Sweden from 1936-1976 an impressive 40-year run . The post-war hegemony of social democratic parties saw the establishment of the ' Nordic Model ' or the Nordic variety of capitalism . <p> A demonstration outside Norway 's Parliament building . Nordic countries rate highly when it comes to public trust in democracy and government . Picture : Tore <p> This regional political and economic project is built around a mixed market economy , or the idea that both government and the private companies have a role in coordinating the economy .

All score highly not only on overall competitiveness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These small , highly competitive Northern European nations provide the most comprehensive welfare system in the world , complimented by free education and universal healthcare . From birth to death , Nordic citizens have access to quality , government funded services irrespective of income . <p> However , the real strength of the Nordic Model has been its flexibility . There is no single policy platform for the five countries . Unemployment insurance , pension systems , tax burdens , child care and aged care assistance are designed , structured and implemented in wildly different ways . Sweden has the largest share of private sector care providers , Denmark has the highest level of taxation , unemployment insurance is mandatory in Norway , while it is voluntary elsewhere in the Nordic region . What unites them are the underlying values of egalitarianism , inclusion and care . <p> Some dismiss the small Northern European nations ' consistent standing in these quality of life measures as ' Nordic exceptionalism ' the idea that somehow Nordic people are just naturally more egalitarian . Yet , there is no " egalitarian gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fairness . <p> Another common criticism is that any wealthy country with decent healthcare and the rule of law will experience similar results . This is true to a certain extent within the confines of the WHR . Australia , New Zealand and Canada all make it into the top 10 happiest countries . But this does n't explain why the Nordic countries still consistently come out ahead of these other countries . What does further distinguish the Nordic countries however is the higher levels equality and trust in their societies . And while Australia and Sweden rank equal at ninth , it is worth noting that Sweden has gone furthest down the path towards liberalism and has seen the greatest drop in ranking . <h> Australia Reconstructed ? <p> There are also claims that the globalised market requires all market economies to converge on the most efficient model . The Economist argues that the Nordic countries have ' simply reached the limits of big government ' .

Trust in governmental , democratic and legislative institutions is amongst the highest in the world . Nordic people trust their countries to take care of them , and governments make sure they deliver . This makes them happy to pay their taxes , which are amongst the highest in the OECD . <p> The real question is could Australia be more like these ' happiness superpowers ' ? It seems that we very nearly were . In 1986 , the Australian Council of Trade Unions ( ACTU ) funded a study tour of what was then known as Western Europe for some of the trade union movements most influential and powerful leaders , in order to formulate their policy agenda for the upcoming elections . They were fascinated by the Nordic region and a sizeable portion of their research focused on trying to understand the way that Nordic market economies function , and how could these lessons be applied back home . <p> The result was Australia Reconstructed in 1987 .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Taking the sludge out of wastewater <p> As a researcher in the " sludge group " , Sam Skinner is passionate about what we flush down our drains <p> By Sam Skinner , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Wastewater treatment is arguably the greatest achievement of the industrial revolution and it means 5 million people can live in Melbourne without major health and sanitation issues . The health benefits of the treatment and disposal of wastewater have been enormous . When we talk about wastewater , we are talking about what is flushed down the toilet or washed down the kitchen sink . There is a slow shifting in attitudes from wastewater being seen as something that is dangerous and to be disposed of , to something that has value . <p> Wastewater is an untapped resource . To create a sustainable future , and secure our water resources , we need to do more with it . There are two aspects to this : recovering the water and extracting value from the nutrients in the solids stream . Instead of wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The water that 's extracted can be used instead of fresh water in agriculture and industry . The technology is already available to safely produce drinking water but there are obviously some barriers to this . <p> It was while teaching physics in Tanzania during a gap year that Mr Skinner came to appreciate the importance of wastewater treatment in daily life . Picture : Supplied <p> Sludge is what 's left once the water has been extracted . Getting rid of this sludge is the major cost of wastewater treatment . We keep creating more and more of it , but we have no way of getting rid of it . So it sits there and is stockpiled in ' sludge mountains ' . Once the harmful bacteria and chemicals have been removed , sludge is a treasure trove of nutrients . It offers a rich source of nitrogen and phosphorous that can be be used in fertilisers , or to produce valuable chemicals . This potential to create sustainable change is my reason for working in the area , despite the obviously unglamorous nature of the research . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I certainly had an understanding of our dependence on water to survive . But I took it for granted that when I turned the tap , clean and fresh water would come out . After I finished my science degree I took a year off . I spent a semester teaching physics in Tanzania , and it was then that the importance of wastewater treatment to our everyday lives really hit home . After seeing the open channels carrying wastewater through towns , I knew I wanted to pursue a career in water and sanitation . <p> Sam Skinner is researching the best ways to manage wastewater , to benefit the environment and our health . Picture : Supplied <p> On one of my first days back in the lab for my PhD , I was being shown how to use the equipment and we were pulling everything apart at the end of a test . There was some sludge that had n't compacted as much as I 'd expected and it splashed all down the front of my lab coat . It 's a running joke among my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since . <p> I am part of the research group affectionately known as the " sludge group " . We specialise in the solid-liquid separations aspect of wastewater treatment . This can be filtration , centrifugation or even just settling under gravity . This is also called dewatering separating out a liquid stream from a mainly solids stream in order to produce high quality water and reduce the volume of the sludge . <p> Wastewater is a nightmare to dewater . It forms networked structures at low concentrations of solids , sometimes less than 1 per cent . The classic comparison is Aeroplane Jelly you add a little bit of powder and lots of water and then stick it in the fridge . Once it is set , good luck trying to squeeze it to get that water back . Filtration of wastewater poses the same problem . <p> There is no such thing as a ' holy ' crap . By the time it is flushed , pumped , treated and ready for disposal , it is awful to filter . Improved knowledge of the filtration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internationally . <p> The good news is that not all sludges are created equal . There are many treatments that can improve the sludge . Through accurate modelling of wastewater filtration , we showed for the first time the link between ease of filtration and the organic content of the sludge - that is the bacteria and the sticky substances that they produce . By destroying that organic fraction , the sizes of filters required can be reduced by up to 5000 per cent . <p> Stockpiling of sludge is a huge environmental issue facing modern society . These findings can help reduce the amount of sludge that goes into sludge mountains at water treatment plants . But , more than that , improving sludge disposal can also significantly reduce the cost of wastewater treatment and help make it more accessible to more communities around the world . The ultimate goal is to help push towards a world where everyone is serviced by a sustainably engineered wastewater treatment unit and we are making 's Privacy Officer at **30;0;TOOLONG

Only then is at least some thought given to future supplies and sustainability . <p> Overconsumption of energy-rich foods has resulted in over 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even as 1 billion people go to bed hungry every day and around 2 billion suffer from malnutrition . The image of crops rotting in fields due to poor infrastructure in the developing world will be familiar to many , but when it comes to food ' rotting in the fridge ' , people in North America and Oceania top the world , wasting around 100kg of food every year each . <h> Climate change compounds food insecurity <p> In contrast food is highly respected in the developing world . This different perspective has a number of underlying causes but an overriding one is that many in the developing world are simply uncertain as to where their next meal is coming from . Over 70 per cent of all food consumed worldwide comes from smallholder farmers in developing countries , and those small , family farms are subject to the increasing challenges of land and soil degradation , reduced water availability , increasing costs for energy-rich inputs , poor infrastructure and often poor policy support . <p> Climate change will multiply these challenges , and is already significantly impacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The current food security challenge is therefore already formidable with our existing population , but global population is still growing at around 150 people per minute . At the same time prime farmland is being lost to urbanisation and degradation at over two hectares per minute and available water per person is reducing in key catchments . Agriculture already accounts for around 70 per cent of global freshwater withdrawals and 45 per cent of food crop production is dependent on irrigation . And there is already rapidly increasing competition for that water from cities . Australia 's Murray-Darling Basin is a microcosm of the problem , but in other parts of the world it is far more serious . <p> Added to these natural resources challenges is the widespread use of nitrogen fertilisers to increase the productivity of farming systems globally . Nitrogen from fertiliser now accounts for more than half of the protein in human diets . In other words , our food security depends on it . And yet the most commonly used nitrogen fertiliser , urea , is a product of fossil fuel requiring around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urea . Yet half of this fertiliser is lost to the environment as run-off or greenhouse gasses , causing degradation of waterways , climate change and public health . This is in a world that is trying to lessen its use and dependence on non-renewable energy sources . <p> This confluence of pressures on food production systems , multiplied by climate change are the elements of a ' perfect storm ' that requires urgent , strategic and long-term investment to help farmers everywhere , including here in Australia . <p> Meanwhile , food insecurity due to severe drought and conflicts has seen the need for global emergency food assistance reach unprecedented levels . Famine now threatens four countries simultaneously -- South Sudan , Somalia , Yemen and Nigeria . Food crises can compound and create political crises . <p> The most recent example is provided by Syria , where three years of drought , the consequential shortage of food and the failure of government to respond adequately led to mass migration to the cities . Poverty and unemployment provide a fertile breeding ground for discontent and its exploitation by extremist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Waste not , want not <p> Yet despite all this , the ' she 'll be right ' attitude seems to be the mindset not only for consumers , but also for most governments . Investments by government in the agricultural sector have not only markedly decreased over recent decades , but have also fallen prey to the ' short-termism ' that now pervades many political arenas , both near and far . But long-term sustainability issues require long-term thinking , patient investments and recognition that we ca n't afford to waste food and resources . <p> What would it mean to future food security globally if we could sharply reduce the more than 30 per cent of food that is currently wasted ? Various studies have shown that the results could be startling . If we could cut our wastage in the western world where the majority of losses arise at the consumption end of the value chain this could have substantial benefits for global food security . The 2050 target for increased food production could be reduced from a 70 per cent down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time when " large " portions are now the new " regular " , we need to be choosing the " small " option , both for our own health and the health of everyone else . <p> Professor Timothy Reeves presented a free public lecture on " The ' Grand Challenges ' for Agriculture and Future Food and Nutritional Security " at the University of Melbourne on 23 March 2017 .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Guiding gut nerves home <p> Transplanting stem cells into the gut to replace missing nerves may be an alternative to surgery for children with Hirschsprung 's Disease <p> By Elisabeth Lopez , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> After a baby is born , a souvenir of its months in the womb is usually not long to follow . Its first poo , or meconium , is a lump sum of everything the foetus has ingested for months ; a dark sludge , compared by the insomniac readers of parenting forums to engine oil or tar . <p> That first stool is probably the ground zero for Dad jokes . But if it has n't emerged after 48-72 hours , doctors know to start looking for Hirschsprung Disease . Although rare , affecting one in 5000 live births , Hirschsprung 's effects can be debilitating and lifelong , including bowel obstructions , constipation , reflux and vomiting . <p> " The muscles in the gut wall of these babies are not doing their job , which is to push food through the intestines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulates , their bellies get distended and the effect is like blocking the end of a fire hose , " says developmental neurobiologist Professor Heather Young , of the University of Melbourne . <p> Neurospheres , which are grown from stem cells from healthy parts of the bowel and measure one fifth of a millimetre , are transplanted back into the gut to help treat Hirschprung 's Disease . Picture : Supplied <p> Professor Young 's lab is exploring the potential for stem cell transplants to treat Hirschsprung 's Disease , and other disorders of the gut 's nervous system . In a recently published article , the team extracted stem cells from healthy parts of the bowel , grew them in a dish ( these tiny balls , called neurospheres , measure one fifth of a millimetre , requiring some very fine forceps ) , and transplanted them back into sections of the gut wall that are missing neurons in Hirschsprung disease . <p> Currently , the only treatment for Hirschsprung 's is surgery , which , while lifesaving , is usually followed by complications and psychosocial issues from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most severe form of the disease , life is really tough . They 're on a feeding tube and total parenteral ( intravenous ) nutrition for the rest of their lives , " Professor Young says . <p> The research team , based at the University , the Florey Institute and Queen 's University in Canada , is investigating what happens when the development of the gut nerves , or enteric nervous system , is derailed , causing disorders like Hirschsprung 's . Often called the ' second brain ' , this extensive network of 500 million neurons ( five times the number of neurons in the spinal cord ) controls digestion and excretion . <p> Our gut neurons are responsible for gut motility , or peristalsis the muscular spasms that push food from the stomach , into the intestines and out through the anus . And researchers are now also exploring its influence on mood and behaviour , and links with conditions such as autism and even some forms of epilepsy . . <p> When things go well , the enteric nervous system rumbles away in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd tummy ache ) . But when things go awry , the effects can be devastating . <p> The gut odyssey <p> Like all epic stories , the story of the gut nervous system begins with a massive migration . <p> Gut neurons start life as stem cells located near the base of the developing brain . Making their way from the neural tube into the developing gut tube , they then colonise the entire gastrointestinal tract . Once there , many of them differentiate into nerve cells that make the muscles in the gut wall relax , while some differentiate into nerve cells that are responsible for contractions . Others , known as interneurons , are the middlemen that connect those movements into a rhythm . <p> " Think of the East coast of Australia as the gastrointestinal tract , with Cairns the oesophagus and Melbourne the . . . ahem . . . other end , " explains Lincon Stamp , from Prof Young 's laboratory . <p> " Imagine people migrating down the coast in their cars , all from top to bottom . Normally some make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to set up homes in cities along the way . However , sometimes the people destined for Melbourne run out of fuel and are stranded further up the coast . <p> " In Hirschsprung disease this is due to genetic defects some random , some inherited which cause the migrating cells to run out of fuel , leaving them stranded and the last part of the bowel unoccupied . " <p> Hirschprung 's disease is usually picked up within the first few days of life . Picture : / Flickr <p> Most infants are diagnosed with Hirschsprung before they leave hospital , but if only a small region of the bowel is affected , the condition might not be picked up for weeks or months . Surgeons will often remove the affected section of bowel and reattach what 's left . <p> " When neurons in your bowel are diseased or damaged , they 're really challenging conditions for gastroenterologists to treat . There are currently no drug treatments , " says Dr Stamp . <p> Gut motility disorders also strike later in life , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as Parkinson 's disease affects a specific type of brain neuron . By contrast , childhood disorders are usually defined by a total absence of neurons in sections of the bowel or the entire organ . <p> One increasingly common adult condition is gastroparesis , which is associated with uncontrolled diabetes , Parkinson 's disease , and MS . Another is achalasia , characterised by the loss of neurons that enable the sphincter to open and close the oesophagus . It mainly affects elderly people , and is a kind of mirror image to the popular complaint of gastrointestinal reflux , where stomach acid leaks out and up from the oesophagus . Only in achalasia , the oesophagus fails to open at all . <p> " They ca n't swallow solids they end up living on soup and liquids . They can choke because the sphincter is not opening , " Professor Young says . <p> The work by Lincon Stamp and his team on an animal model of Hirschsprung disease is essentially about completing that disrupted migratory journey of stem cells from the brain to the bowel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonise a reasonably good area of the bowel after the transplant , " says Dr Stamp . <p> " We 've been able to transplant cells that survive four months , while another group in the UK has achieved 24 months . " <p> The transplanted cells not only survive they look and behave like neurons . <p> " Stem cell therapy for a gut motility disorder requires neurons that do n't just fire they have to connect with the muscle in the gut wall , to control the relaxation and contractions that move food through , " Dr Stamp says . <p> A new technique called optogenetics enabled the team to confirm the transplanted neurons were behaving as they should . Optogenetics involves inserting light-sensitive proteins , derived from green algae and called opsins , into neurons . The opsins activate the neurons . The team recorded the results to check for signals from the muscles . ( Before opsins came on the scene around 2008 , neuroscientists could only use electrodes to control neurons ) . <p> One of the challenges for the Young lab is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient numbers for transplantation .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Four reasons Marine Le Pen probably wo n't become French president <p> Despite polling well in the lead-up to the 2017 French presidential election , the controversial figure is unlikely to triumph <p> By Dr Maryse Helbert , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> The National Front 's Marine Le Pen has been one of the front-runners in opinion polls throughout the French presidential election campaign and her anti-EU , anti-Islam platform has grabbed attention around the world . <p> Le Pen , like Nigel Farage in the UK and Donald Trump in the US , has capitalised on significant discontent with the status quo , especially among economically disenfranchised white voters . <p> As well as performing strongly in opinion polls , she has a faithful and disciplined supporter base who are highly likely to vote . This is significant because voting is not compulsory in France . <p> Marine Le Pen of the National Front is a leading candidate in the 2017 French presidential elections . Picture : Blandine Le Cain / Flickr <p> But Le Pen is still a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . She has strong competition in an unusual field <p> Facing Le Pen is a plethora of 11 candidates , which in itself is n't unusual . But it 's very unusual to have a field of candidates who are n't dominated by the conservative Republican party or the Left-wing Socialist Party . <p> Le Pen 's main rival is independent centrist , Emmanuel Macron . Like Le Pen , Macron is presenting himself as a political outsider who is not beholden to traditional party classifications , but he is a socially liberal centrist trying to appeal to the mainstream . <p> However , and contrary to Le Pen , those currently favouring Macron in the polls are volatile swinging voters , and may need convincing to get out and vote on the day . <p> Francois Fillon for the Right-wing Republican party was , until recently , running close behind Le Pen . But his position has been jeopardised by corruption allegations ( which he has denied ) , including the payment of a parliamentary salary to his wife for a job she did n't have , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fillon 's campaign to become French President is suffering from corruption allegations .

The top two candidates in the first round of voting ( April 23 ) go through to the second round ( May 7 ) , where voters choose between them and the winner becomes President . <p> In the second round of voting , the weaknesses of Le Pen namely her great difficulty in attracting a diversified wider crowd of voters are the strengths of Macron . As Macron has campaigned as being ' above ' political parties , but attached to centre political values , he is likely to be able to reach voters on both sides of the political spectrum . <p> Le Pen 's political platform gives us a clue as to how she is trying to reach out . In the north of France , a working class region , she emphasises social policies such as increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of France , a much wealthier and older population , she emphasises neoliberal and security policies such as tax breaks , fewer bureaucratic procedures and being tougher on crime . <p> Emmanuelle Macron is a centrist who is likely to appeal to a wider base than Marine Le Pen . Picture : LeWeb / Flickr <p> However , even if Le Pen wins the first round of voting , she will have to face an ' anyone but Le Pen ' campaign against her . Opinions polls indicate she is likely to lose by a large margin . <p> A similar situation was faced by her father , Jean Marie Le Pen , in 2002 . In that election the second round of voting was between Jacques Chirac and Le Pen , who had unexpectedly beaten Lionel Jospin to finish in second place . But Le Pen subsequently lost 20 per cent to Chirac 's 80 per cent , unable to appeal to a wider range of voters . <p> 3 .

It has also led to the fall of many prominent political figures . <p> 4 . She is facing corruption allegations of her own <p> In late February , allegations of fake jobs paid for by EU funds emerged against Le Pen and different members of the National Front , particularly its chief of staff and media adviser .

The OECD predicts that by 2025 over 40 per cent of the adult population in member countries will hold a tertiary qualification . <p> A more educated population can generate prosperity for whole communities . Yet , as we have become increasingly well educated , inequality has grown . Leaving behind whole groups of people diminishes the political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and technology have been key factors . <p> Changes to work and labour markets in wealthy countries mean jobs not requiring a university or college education are gone for many people - and they are not returning . <p> Technology has long been predicted to disrupt working lives but as inequality grows and many lose out , its wide-reaching affects become all too clear for whole communities . <p> Some estimates forecast that technological change in the next 10 to 15 years will make almost 40 per cent of jobs in Australia redundant , including many highly skilled roles . Research examining 702 occupations found 47 per cent of workers in America had jobs at high risk of being replaced by technology . <p> Universities have played a leading role in the discovery and development of the new technologies that are now set to cause so much social change . Many will fairly say that universities have a responsibility in helping bridge the emerging divide between those with a university education and those without . Are universities doing enough to prepare people for future jobs ? <p> During the panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they prepare students to adapt them to a radically changing economy . <p> " This notion that you have your four year ( degree ) and it prepares you for a 30-year career and then you retire does n't make sense anymore , " he said .

The reaction to changing technology this time around might be more wide ranging than the nineteenth century , as other divisions run deep between the winners and losers from the liberal order . <p> Education has become a fundamental divide in democracy . Education was prophetic in the voting patterns in both the recent US election and Brexit vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Republican primary was the absence of a college degree . Voters with postgraduate qualifications split 75 to 25 in favour of ' remain ' in Brexit , meanwhile , among those who left school without any qualifications , the vote was almost exactly reversed : 73 to 27 for ' leave ' . <p> But the problems go deeper . Over the last 30 years the belief in the importance of a democratically elected government has diminished . Here too universities must share some of the blame . Never has the world been so educated yet much of the debate is at odds with the evidence . Universities have long been important for providing evidence to inform debate even when they are not directly involved . Universities need to do more to educate and lead . <p> Professor Kothari told the audience that universities had a key role as global institutions in countering the " fear of otherness " that she said was a catalyst in both the Brexit vote in the UK and the election of Donald Trump in the US . <p> " They were both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of otherness , " she said .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> France 's presidential campaign : a strategy of fear versus a strategy of opportunity <p> The French presidential election campaign is revealing a clear divide among the electorate , along similar lines to Trump and Brexit <p> By Paul Soyez and Professor Philomena Murray <p> Share selection to : <p> What a strange campaign it has been so far . With a few weeks to go until the first round of the French presidential election , many people in France are stunned by the low quality of the debates , which have been largely dominated by Fran ? ois Fillon 's legal saga . There has , to date , been very little in-depth discussion about actual policy . <p> So much of this debate seems to be a distraction from the business of governing . And yet behind the highly mediatised judicial turmoil of some of the candidates , it is becoming increasingly clear that the debates in France 's presidential campaign are about two significantly opposed visions of the future : one is declinist , supported by strategies of fear , and the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marine Le Pen , pictured here at a National Front rally , is a leading candidate in the French 2017 presidential election . Picture : Blandine Le Cain / Flickr <p> Three candidates claim they represent a majority of the French people , haunted by a fear of French decline and deeply anxious about France 's role in an increasingly globalised world . <p> This approach of anxiety and threat perception is represented by Marine Le Pen , leader of the Far-Right party le Front National , by Jean-Luc M ? lenchon , candidate for the Far-Left movement la France insoumise , and by Fran ? ois Fillon , candidate of the conservative party Les R ? . <p> On the other hand , there is a very different strategy , developed by Beno ? t Hamon , candidate for the Socialist Party , and , more importantly , Emmanuel Macron , leader of En Marche ! What is remarkable is that both candidates promote a far more optimistic vision of opportunities for a better life and a better France . <h> Where Far-Left and Far-Right Meet <p> Far-Left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many respects . Nonetheless , as Ernst Nolte showed in his analysis of the similarities and differences between fascist regimes , Far-Right and Far-Left programs also often converge . Le Pen and M ? lenchon share four similar diagnoses of the economic , identity and societal insecurities France is facing . <p> First , both M ? lenchon and Le Pen base their strategies on anti-EU policies , claiming that France 's economic independence requires a withdrawal from the euro zone , from the European Union 's treaties , and even , in the case of Le Pen , an exit from the EU as a whole a Frexit in the style of the UK 's Brexit . <p> Second , both leaders adhere to significant anti-globalisation policies . Le Pen and M ? lenchon both claim that France 's economic difficulties come from its openness to the global market and their remedy is protectionist policies . <p> A third common approach in narrative is that both play on the rejection of traditional elites and present themselves as anti-system . <p> This strategy has been successful as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system they loudly condemn a trait observers of Donald Trump will recognise . Le Pen 's family is extremely wealthy and deeply connected to France 's aristocracy and Jean-Luc M ? lenchon was a Minister in a former Socialist government . <p> However , the Far-Left has been associated with policy failure because M ? lenchon has been in government in the past . Thus the strategy of fear mainly reinforces Le Pen 's popularity , rather than M ? lenchon 's . <p> More broadly , both candidates call for the return to an idealised and historically inaccurate past . According to Marine Le Pen , France 's salvation will come from a return to a traditional society that does not value any diversity , implementing strict assimilation policies . For M ? lenchon , the solution is a return to a protectionist economy that supports a strong working class . So essentially these two candidates use the language of fear to present a choice of a clash of civilisations . <p> The graphic representation of the Far-Right electorate in France tends to be an overlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the 1990s , when the communist party ( PCF ) lost its appeal . According to a poll carried out in early March this year , 48 per cent of the French working class now supports Marine Le Pen 's program . <h> Towards the centre <p> The conservative candidate Fran ? ois Fillon is not as pessimistic as these extremes , although he does call for tough austerity measures . As the leader of Les R ? , he argues France 's main remedy to its economic difficulties should consist of drastically reducing state expenditures to shrink the country 's public deficit . For example , Fillon promises to reduce the administration by 500,000 public servants . <p> He claims the French must tighten their belts for the next five years in order to avoid a situation like Greece . Like Le Pen and M ? lenchon , Fillon 's strategy also promotes the idea that globalisation constitutes an obstacle to France 's autonomy , identity and prosperity . <p> Conservative candidate Fran ? ois Fillon has been plagued by corruption scandals during the 2017 French presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two youngest candidates in the presidential election , who have developed their strategies with a distinctly optimistic tone ? <p> Emmanuel Macron and Beno ? t Hamon , whose programs are significantly different , share a discourse around the politics of opportunity . Both candidates promote a strategy of welcome and acceptance when it comes to immigration and refugees , with Macron going so far as to seek to implement Merkel 's immigration policy in France . <p> However , Macron , like Hamon , struggles to convince many workers there are benefits for them in a globalised economy . Macron 's electorate is currently limited to the most educated part of the population , which has been the main beneficiary of globalisation . <p> It is still difficult to predict who will be the next French president . The campaign has an increasingly populist dimension , as all candidates seek to deal with the disaffection with established parties and political elites . <p> What is clear is that the campaign reveals narratives of two very distinctive Frances - one that perceives an ever-more globalised economy as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After Brexit and Trump , will French voters halt the declinist and populist wave in some Western democracies ? <p> Paul Soyez is a researcher on French-Australian relations at the University of Melbourne .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Persuading baby to wee on demand <p> How a simple technique greatly increases the chances of collecting infant urine samples when you need them <p> By Catriona May , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Managing when a baby wees may seem like black magic to parents who are all too familiar with the unpredictable nature of an infant 's toilet habits . <p> " They call infant urine samples ' liquid gold ' for good reason , " says Dr Jonathan Kaufman , a doctor at the Royal Children 's Hospital in Melbourne . <p> " Baby wee can be elusive . " <p> This trickiness can make collecting a urine sample from an infant difficult . But Dr Kaufman , who is also a researcher at the University of Melbourne and the Murdoch Children 's Research Institute , has developed a simple method that encourages babies to urinate , greatly increasing the chances of collection . <p> Known as Quick-Wee , and recently published in The BMJ , the method involves gently rubbing the lower abdomen in circular motions with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urination . <p> Current methods for collecting a urine sample from an infant can be , at best , time consuming and , at worst , distressing . <p> When doctors suspect a baby may have a urinary tract infection ( UTI ) they often use a method known as Clean Catch , where they wait for the infant to go to the toilet spontaneously , and use a cup to ' catch ' the urine . This can take a long time and has a high failure rate , as well as a risk of sample contamination . <p> If Clean Catch fails or time is of the essence , clinicians may need to use a catheter or a needle ( extracting the urine directly from the bladder ) to collect the sample , which is invasive and painful . <p> Taking a urine sample from an infant is notoriously difficult . Picture : Pexels <p> " The signs of UTI in young children are very non-specific , and collecting a sample for diagnosis is difficult , " explains Dr Kaufman . <p> " So in practice some children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are prescribed antibiotics when a UTI is suspected but not confirmed , meaning they receive antibiotics they do n't need . <p> " Other times there is a delay starting treatment when they do have a UTI . " <p> Dr Kaufman first conceived Quick-Wee when he was working night shifts as a paediatric trainee . He noticed that cleaning the skin in preparation for inserting a catheter often triggered babies to urinate . <p> " I wondered if this could form the basis for a more formal method of collecting urine samples , " he says . <p> " Then one night there was a baby in the emergency department who really needed a urine sample , but the junior doctor was n't able to do a catheter . <p> " I could n't get down there straight away , so I asked the doctor to get everything ready for a catheter , and to keep cleaning the skin while they waited with a cup ready in case they could catch some wee . <p> " It worked , they had collected a urine sample by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team trialled the method with 354 babies under 12 months who needed a urine sample in the Royal Children 's Hospital emergency department . <p> The Quick-Wee trial was conducted in the emergency department at the Royal Children 's Hospital in Melbourne . Picture : Wikimedia <p> For half the children the doctor or nurse tried to collect a urine sample using Quick-Wee , while the other half used the standard Clean Catch method , for up to five minutes . <p> Thirty-one percent of patients urinated within five minutes with the Quick-Wee method , compared to only 12 per cent with standard Clean Catch . <p> " Our trial showed that Quick-Wee can speed up urine collection for many babies , " says Dr Kaufman . <p> " Collecting the sample quickly means the clinician can test for a UTI in a timely fashion , and either treat with appropriate antibiotics , or move on and look for other diagnoses , " he says . " It also decreases the chances of needing an invasive collection method , like a catheter or a needle , for some children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaufman was when he used Quick-Wee for his own infant daughter . <p> " We were away visiting family in the country , and she had a fever and was vomiting all night , " he recalls . <p> " The doctor in the emergency department there wanted to check a urine sample , so we used Quick-Wee . We collected a sample within a few minutes , which meant she did n't need a needle or catheter procedure , and there was no delay in starting her antibiotic treatment . " <p> Quick-Wee is a very simply method that can be used by clinicians in a wide range of settings . Picture : Supplied <p> Quick-Wee works by triggering early childhood cutaneous voiding reflexes - nerves on the skin which , when stimulated in young children , trigger involuntary urination . There is a similar process in some animals , whose mothers lick the perineum to stimulate the spinal reflexes in their young . <p> Because most children develop voluntary control of their bladder function by three years of age , Quick-Wee is best suited younger children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For Dr Kaufman , Quick-Wee 's simplicity is key to its success . <p> " It 's a very pragmatic and easy method that can be used anywhere : in big hospitals , in the community , in general practice , and in resource-limited settings like remote areas or where equipment or paediatric medical services are not easily accessible , " he says . <p> And , as an added bonus , he now has a good line of University 's Privacy Officer at **30;254;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> Why is Russia still supporting Syria ? <p> As G7 ministers meet to discuss Russia 's role in Syria , its historical emphasis on statehood offers an insight into why Putin still supports Bashar Al-Assad <p> By Dr William Partlett , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> President Donald Trump 's decision to launch 59 Tomahawk missiles to punish the Syrian regime for its chemical weapon attack drew immediate condemnation from the Russian government . <p> As the Syrian regime continues to flout international norms , why would Russia risk further international isolation by offering its ongoing support ? <p> Many have suggested the answer lies in a cynical version of realpolitik . They argue that Russia continues to support the Syrian regime in order to protect its own strategic interests and , in particular , to fight terrorism while also becoming an important power broker in the Middle East . These considerations no doubt play an important role . <p> President Bashar al-Assad and President Vladimir Putin met in Moscow in 2015 to discuss the military operations in Syria . Picture : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Russian constitutional history has largely been ignored . <p> For the Russians , protecting President Assad and the Syrian regime is about protecting the integrity of Syria 's " statehood " , known in Russia as . Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed this concept at the centre of his own public statements about Syria . When discussing the role of Russian troops in Syria in April 2016 , he stated their chief goal was to protect Syria 's statehood . And later that year when discussing Russia 's troop presence , he said they had successfully protected gosudarstvennost in Syria . <h> A brief history OF statehood <p> Appeals to the importance statehood have a deep resonance in Russian history . <p> In fact , the most influential school of Russian historiography rejects the Western view that history is a progression towards limited government that allows space for individual liberty . Instead , this " statist school of historiography " views Russian history as a steady progression from anarchical tribalism to a strong state , or gosudarstvo , that will organically unite the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> During the late imperial Russian period , a group of influential constitutional thinkers drew on this to argue that an enlightened Tsar with strong powers was the only way to develop this Russian state . This approach attempted to chart a middle path between appeals for Western-style limited constitutional government on one hand and socialist revolution on the other . <p> Both paths , these thinkers argued , would undermine the true progressive goal of Russian history : the development of the Russian state . This approach was best summed up in the words of one of Vladimir Putin 's favourite imperial Russian statesman , Petr Stolypin : " We do not need great upheavals . We need a great Russia . " <p> Since the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russian leadership has sought to find this middle path and rebuild the power of the Russian state . In 1993 , then-President Boris Yeltsin argued that Russia 's first post-communist constitution must protect " the unity of the Russian state " in order to overcome " the weakness of government power " . <p> To do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from copying the American , French or other models " and instead return to " Russian roots " . This viewpoint is reflected in Russia 's current constitution which frequently cites the importance of preserving its statehood . <p> Later in 2000 , soon-to-be President Vladimir Putin 's pre-election manifesto vowed to put this constitution into effect , explaining that a strong state was not an " anomaly , or something that should be struggled against " in Russia . Instead , he argued that a strong state is " a source and guarantor of order , and the initiator and main driving force of any change . " <p> This belief in the strong state remains in Russia to this day . <h> Implications for the Syrian crisis <p> Many Russian political elites view the Syrian conflict through this statist worldview . They see any kind of western-led regime change as likely to lead to the destruction of Syria 's statehood . This viewpoint is backed up , they argue , by Western interventions in both Libya and Iraq , which ultimately destroyed the state in those countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution to the crisis must be very careful to preserve and potentially strengthen Syria 's " statehood . " This can be seen clearly in the draft constitution the Russians put forward to solve the Syrian crisis , which went to great lengths to ensure institutions like the Syrian presidency would have vast powers to maintain the unity and integrity of Syrian statehood . <p> This has several implications . <p> First , it suggests that Russia 's attachment to the Syrian regime is more than just strategic ; this support also has an ideological component . This means Russia will likely continue to do everything it can including using its veto on the Security Council to block any Western plan for removing President Bashar Al-Assad from power by force . <p> Second , and more importantly , an understanding of this worldview suggests a possible strategy for Western diplomats in negotiating with the Russians on Syria . If they can acknowledge the Russians have a legitimate concern in preserving state power in Syria and working to avoid a descent into anarchy , they are more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve a number of complicated questions . <p> Perhaps the most important is whether opposition groups ( and their patrons in Turkey and Saudi Arabia ) will ever accept the continuance of , or at least some version of , the current Syrian state into the future . <p> But if Western negotiators can acknowledge the importance of avoiding chaos and preserving some semblance of state power in Syria , they are more likely to find ways to convince the Russians to help remove Assad , and this could represent an important step forward in an University 's Privacy Officer at **30;721;TOOLONG

The White Paper will provide a roadmap for advancing and protecting Australia 's international interests and define how we engage with the world in the years ahead . <p> It might be argued that not since the 1940s - before the forging of our US alliance - has Australia faced such a strategic challenge . <p> It 's true that the United States ' role in our region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now the new Trump administration has declared a willingness to abandon long-standing alliances and policy settings . <p> Malcolm Turnbull speaks to British Prime Minister Theresa May at the G20 Summit .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Sex and ping pong : Sidney Nolan and the Gallery School <p> The centenary of Sidney Nolan 's birth will be marked globally , but what can we learn from his time as a student at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School ? <p> By Dr Janine Burke , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> April 2017 is Sidney Nolan 's centenary . During the 1930s , Australia 's best-known artist studied at the National Gallery Art School , the direct predecessor to the Victorian College of the Arts , which is itself celebrating 150 years of art in Melbourne . In juxtaposing Nolan 's history and the school 's , narratives about art practice and pedagogy , as well as Melbourne 's cultural networks , begin to emerge . <p> Not that Nolan was a star student : he appeared to treat his schooling with a dilettantish indifference . When the celebrated artist Albert Tucker asked Nolan about his education at the Gallery School , he replied , " All I learned about was sex and ping pong " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picture : State Library of Victoria <p> The Gallery School was the most accessible of Melbourne 's art schools . The fees were cheaper than at George Bell 's modernist school or at the Melbourne Institute of Technology -- though during the 1930s Great Depression some Gallery students , such as Tucker , still found it impossible to finance their education there . <p> Acceptance to the school was gained through a folio of work but , as most applicants were successful , there was a large student intake of men and women from a variety of social backgrounds . The casual nature of entry times ? -- enrolment could take place at any point during the year -- coupled with the availability of night classes enabled students to complete the course part-time . <p> The Gallery was a useful place for a young artist to be . It provided a basic form of tuition at cheap rates , a circle of like-minded friends , and studio space that a lack of finances or unwilling parents may have put out of reach of some students . <p> The artist Lionel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while teacher and painter George Bell castigated the staff and students for being commercial artists who produced saleable paintings , mere commodities . What had gone wrong ? <p> In 1936 , the art critic J. S. McDonald was appointed Director of the National Gallery and Master of the School . <p> McDonald was a notorious reactionary as far as modern art was concerned . He proved the point when , a few years later , he refused to allow an exhibition of modern art , curated by Herald art critic Basil Burdett , to be displayed there . The landmark show , known as the Herald Exhibition of French and British Painting , opened at Melbourne Town Hall in June 1939 , not long before the outbreak of World War II . <p> McDonald was a member of the club of powerful older men who ran the Australian art world . This clique , which included Sir Arthur Streeton , exercised a deadening effect on local art . Opposed to post-impressionism , disgusted by Picasso , insular , ill-informed and smug , their taste dominated gallery acquisitions policies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group of men with whom Nolan , Tucker , Joy Hester and their radical cohort in the Contemporary Art Society would soon be pitted in battle . <p> Experimentation in style or approach was not encouraged at the Gallery School . Nor did teachers offer students a philosophy of art or educate them about its history . The course was wholly painstaking practice . There was an insistence on careful modelling of form with minute attention paid to the effects of light and shade and a sombre and descriptive use of colour , which guaranteed a thorough knowledge of the artist 's craft . The course had remained unchanged for decades . <p> Phyl Waterhouse , Alannah Coleman and Charles Bush . Still-life classroom at the National Gallery School in 1935 . Picture : Argus , State Library of Victoria Foundation <p> Though the School 's course was restrictive , its atmosphere was relaxed , even casual .

Night classes started at 7pm . <p> Students would shop at the Victoria Market and bring food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Recreation " was mainly discussion about art but there were table-tennis facilities where Nolan regularly challenged others to play . <p> Nolan had sporadically attended evening classes at the Gallery School since 1934 , but a chance encounter in 1936 with two bright young types -- John Sinclair and Clifford Bayliss , winner of the 1935 National Gallery of Victoria travelling scholarship -- made him re-enrol . Nolan met up with Bayliss and Sinclair on a return cycle ride from Sydney , along the road near Goulburn , and they encouraged him to get more involved with the School . <p> Nolan 's treatment of the figure was unconventional . He simply could n't draw according to the standards of prescriptive realism . He recognised this lack of talent in drawing the human form would preclude him from earning a living as a commercial artist as Tucker , and so many other struggling artists , did . <p> That was why , apart from revelling in discussions with his new friends , the State Library of Victoria proved the big attraction for Nolan . Well , apart from ping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in to draw and then I 'd draw for half an hour and then I 'd think , Oh , bugger it , I 'll go up and read " . Though Nolan read voraciously , he was not so much a reverent student as one who flitted through Kierkegaard , Gide , Rimbaud , Rilke , Dostoyevsky , Lawrence and Blake , intuitively selecting what inspired or intrigued him . <p> One of his earliest works , Illustration for Ulysses ( 1936 , National Gallery of Australia ) , pays homage to James Joyce 's grand modernist statement of the same name that reconfigured the twentieth-century novel . <p> The Gallery School in Swanston Street was located at the heart of Melbourne 's bohemian hub . Nolan embraced it by moving into a studio at the corner of Russell and Lonsdale Streets , shared with DESCS John Sinclair and Noel Counihan , where jazz musician Graeme Bell recalled he had " many a boisterous jam session " . <p> Tucker and Hester lived in a studio-apartment at 26 Little Collins Street while Gino Nibbi 's Leonardo bookshop at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browse . In Rome , Nibbi belonged to a cultural circle that included the Surrealist Giorgio de Chirico . He imported postcard prints , reproductions and books covering contemporary art . <p> It was at the Gallery that Nolan met his first wife . Elizabeth Paterson was a painter and a strikingly attractive young woman . Nolan admired her work , reflecting that his own ambitions lead him to ignore the fact that Elizabeth was a good artist as well , attempting to develop her own style . Elizabeth 's father was unhappy about his daughter 's attachment to Nolan , whom he regarded as a wastrel . <p> Elizabeth Paterson . .

By the early 1940s , both had found the same patrons ? -- Sunday and John Reed -- whose home at Heide proved a refuge during the war years .

Both worked in the same assured and rapid manner : Nolan on the dining-room table at Heide where he completed the Ned Kelly series , Hester sitting by the fire-place producing drawing after drawing -- offering their patrons the privilege of seeing first-rate art being produced in front of their eyes . <p> Nolan took what he needed from the Gallery School -- crucial were the networks of friendship , the alliances that forged Melbourne modernism . In 1938 , Nolan was a founding member of the Contemporary Art Society and the art world was galvanised by debate and dissent . <p> The Gallery taught Nolan what each artist must learn . You must learn to reject what is inessential to your vision , to capitalise on your talents and to discard or disguise your failings .

Picture : Wikipedia <p> Up to this point , munitions manufacturing had been confined to four government munitions factories , three in Victoria and one in country New South Wales . It was an arrangement consistent with an ideological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture of munitions for profit . <p> The immensity of Whitehall 's advice and the potential consequences for Australia in the face of expected threats to the north from Japanese Imperial Forces caused a seismic shift in government policy . To enable self-sufficiency in the supply of munitions the Government decided , for the first time , to permit the manufacture of munitions for profit in private facilities known as war annexes . <p> This strategy was handled through contracts written on a ' cost-plus ' basis , an approach that attracted great controversy and was much maligned in the aftermath of the Great War when the British Government was accused of condoning war profiteering by the vast munitions trusts . The Australian Government was acutely aware of the vulnerability of the nation to the rapacious behaviour of war profiteers . <p> Cost plus contracts were structured with contractors remunerated on the basis of total manufacturing costs plus a margin of profit . Margin of profit could be mandated by government fiat or agreed by negotiation , but the real test came with the identification of costs the Government was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day enjoyed the support of the business community it recognised early the potential political dangers of perceptions in the wider community that it was promoting or condoning excessive profits in a time of national emergency . <p> To encourage private interests to engage in war production , the Government decreed contractors should be rewarded on a reasonable basis and that the people of Australia should be required to pay fair and reasonable prices for the munitions . Incentives were weighted heavily in favour of the contractor unless some form of control was placed over costs to be reimbursed . <p> A young woman drilling aeroplane parts in a munitions factory in South Australia in 1943 . Photographer : Smith , D. Darian <p> To deliver on this promise , in 1939 the Government turned to the Australian accounting profession for advice . The Prime Minister , R.G. Menzies , appointed a panel drawn from the senior ranks of the practicing and commercial elements of the profession . <p> Sir Edwin Nixon . Picture : Faculty of Business and Economics , University of Melbourne <p> Sir Edwin Nixon and Les Schumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melbourne . Sir Edwin was also the first ( part-time ) head of the accounting discipline in the University and a member of the board of the Faculty of Commerce from 1924 to 1932 . <p> The task given the panel was to review the pricing and profit levels related to manufacture of war-related products . This remit was expanded to include existing and potential methods to restrict prices to a fair and equitable rate for both parties . <p> Not surprisingly this advice focused heavily on costing procedures in non-government establishments . At the time all contracting was done with a Standard Form Contract and the panel focused on this from the outset , immediately identifying the major deficiency in the general conditions as the lack of detail on reimbursable costs . <p> The panel 's short tenure lasted from August 1939 until July 1940 and it reported on five separate occasions . <p> In the first and third reports , the panel looked closely at the standard form contract . The second and fourth reports were site-specific investigations of Cockatoo Island Dockyard and Engineering Company in Sydney Harbour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The use of contractors ' auditors for cost verification purposes made up the final report . <p> The summation of the first four reports resulted in the identification of Raw Materials and Direct Labour and a list of Overhead items that the Government should reimburse ( inclusions ) along with a further list of Overhead items that were specifically excluded ( exclusions ) . <p> The advice provided in the first and third reports was distilled and subsequently formalised as a costing memorandum that was circulated widely within the munitions manufacturing industries . In providing this advice the panel was recommending a ' specific identification of overhead costs model ' to establish manufactured costs upon which the margin of profit would be applied in order to establish the amount ( price ) the Government was prepared to reimburse . <p> The advice contrasted with standard contemporary costing orthodoxy that applied an ' overhead application rate ' to determine total manufactured cost and was made in full knowledge of the need to limit the likelihood of profiteering by manipulating overhead . <p> Robert Menzies broadcasting to the nation the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wikipedia <p> Despite its short tenure , the panel was able to provide critical advice to Government at a crucial time in the history of the nation . The advice provided was the foundation of a costing system that was applied throughout the munitions manufacturing sector for the duration of the war . <p> In June 1940 it was subsumed by the Ministry of Munitions . Edwin Nixon , as chair of the panel , was appointed to the full-time post of Director of Finance in the new ministry , continuing the work of the panel as the ministry managed the expansion of munitions manufacturing capacity to levels unimagined before the outbreak of hostilities . <p> The Accountancy Advisory Panel in the Department of Supply and Development was one instance where the technical expertise of the accountancy profession was enlisted by government in the service of the nation during World War 2 .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> A new approach to disability in the workplace <p> While people with disabilities still struggle to find a job , many employers are introducing positive new strategies to support a diverse workforce <p> By Victoria George , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Despite making up nearly a fifth of the population , people with disabilities are drastically under-represented in the Australian workforce . <p> People who have a disability and wish to work are twice as likely to be unemployed as those without a disability . In Australia , the workforce participation rate among the working age population is around 83 per cent , yet this drops to around 50 per cent for people with a disability . <p> A recent inquiry by the Australian Human Rights Commission found the major barriers to employment for people with disabilities include lack of access to education and training , inaccessible work environments , misconceptions , stigma and discrimination . <p> A number of barriers to employment still exist for people with disabilities . Picture : Pexels <p> Despite the existence of anti-discrimination laws in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of disability discrimination complaints each year . <p> According to Dr Jesse Olsen , Senior Research Fellow , a more diverse workforce , when supported and managed properly , can have great benefits . <p> " Increasing the participation of people with disabilities in the workplace is crucial , not only from a community perspective , for the benefit of society as a whole , but also from an economic one , " Dr Olsen says . <p> " It 's well established that creating an inclusive and diverse workplace can lead to higher group performance . " <p> He also points out that increasing labour force participation of people with disabilities means they have a better standard of living , as well as better physical and mental health . <p> Flexible work practices are an important part of supporting people with disabilities in the workplace .

One of the biggest challenges he has found is the prevalence of reports and articles highlighting what workplaces are doing badly . <p> " By emphasising what employers are doing right , we hope to encourage other organisations to follow suit , " Dr Harbridge explains . <p> In 2016 , the Australian Network of Disability ( AND ) asked CWL to help develop an online tool which allows employers to gauge how inclusive they are of customers and employees with disabilities . The Access and Inclusion Index allows employers to reflect on the issues that are barriers to people with disabilities . <p> Now the CWL is working with AND to research how workplace adjustments are being adopted in major organisations . <p> Some organisations are setting a high bar for supporting people with disabilities in the workplace . Picture : Pexels <p> To date , the team has surveyed a range of organisations using a custom-built online tool , and followed up with in-person interviews with staff . <p> " What we have found so far is incredibly encouraging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple ways workplaces are successfully providing adjustments , such as flexible work arrangements . <p> " Letting people work from home or elsewhere , as well as shift their workdays , is often an easy way to allow people to work to their potential , and it creates an inclusive work environment . " <p> Some large workplaces are using ' passports ' which capture the exact nature of the adjustments employees need . The document is held by the employee , and if they transfer to another part of the organisation , they simply offer their new manager the passport and ask for the adjustments to be made . <p> " Some of the successful adjustments we 've seen so far have come from employees ' own networks , as well as from third-party organisations who deal with assistive technologies , " Dr Olsen says . <p> " When people think of employees with disabilities , what springs to mind might be someone who uses a wheelchair who needs an accessible toilet , or someone with a hearing impairment who needs an adapted phone , " Dr Harbridge explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less visible disabilities , such as learning impairments , Parkinson 's or Multiple Sclerosis . We also need to think about adjustments for situations we might not think of as disabilities -- for example women who are breastfeeding or menopausal . " <p> Early findings reveal a significant lack of knowledge and misconceptions about how adjustments can be made . <p> Alex Holland , CWL Research Assistant , notes from both research and anecdotal evidence that perceived cost can be a barrier to workplaces making adjustments . She says employers are often unaware of funding available to help them provide an accessible workplace . In addition , many people with disabilities are simply unaware of the adjustments available . <p> Another issue according to Ms Holland is disclosure : " I believe this is one of the biggest barriers facing people with disabilities -- that dilemma of if , and when , you tell your employer about your disability . <p> " There is a lot of evidence that having a formal disclosure process can encourage people with disabilities to come forward , however it 's also important there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have formal follow-ups to see how well adjustments are working , as some employees might be hesitant to give feedback .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Minding the gap for boys and girls at school <p> Aptitude is n't gendered so how do we address the performance gaps between the sexes in reading and numeracy ? Multiple policy solutions are needed both before and at school <p> By Dr Julie Moschion , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Girls outperform boys in reading ; boys outperform girls in mathematics all across the developed world . <p> Indeed , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 's ( OECD ) Programme for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) study reveals that , at 15 years old , girls do better in reading in all countries , while boys do better in mathematics in six out of 10 countries . These gender gaps are observed as early as the first year of school in reading , and tend to appear more progressively in mathematics after children have started school . <p> They also vary with economic status . The gap favouring girls in reading tends to be larger in poorer countries and among **25;116;TOOLONG ( SES ) children within countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger in richer countries and among high SES children within countries . <p> Recently , there appears to be a consensus among researchers that aptitude ( in any domain ) is not gendered . So what creates those gender gaps and how do we close them ? <p> Girls and boys share the same aptitude so we need to look further into schooling and society if we are to address the performance gaps . Picture : Lucelia <p> In my recent research with Deborah Cobb-Clark , from the University of Sydney , we interrogated the source of the gender gap using data on third-grade numeracy and reading in Australia . <p> Exploiting data from the Longitudinal Survey of Australian Children , in which information on child development reported by parents and teachers is linked to each child 's NAPLAN results , we evaluated the contribution of a large number of individual , family and school factors to these gender gaps . <p> In particular , information on parents ' expectations for and investments in their children , as well as each child 's school readiness , allowed us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those that emerge after . <p> Consistent with international evidence , Australian girls in low and families score better in reading , while boys in high-SES families score better in numeracy . <p> This supports the notion that skill advantages are not naturally gendered but are the result of complex human capital formation processes . And what creates these differences varies between boys and girls . <p> For example , girls ' advantage in reading originates even before starting school . They score better on school readiness tests at four years old , and have better teacher-assessed literacy skills than boys in kindergarten . <p> In contrast , boys ' advantage in numeracy develops later and appears more complex . Before school , high-SES boys do not have more of the characteristics that are associated with higher numeracy test scores than their female peers . For example , they are less ready for school than girls at four years-old and score the same as girls on a cognitive development test at six years-old . In essence , boys are able to produce better outputs with lower inputs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject areas and family circumstances makes it unlikely that a single overarching process drives the relationship between gender and educational achievement . As a result , different approaches are needed to address gaps in numeracy and in reading . <p> While gendered educational practices are unlikely to be the main driver of gender gaps in reading ( which exist before school ) , they could contribute to gender gaps in numeracy . For instance , the advantage of high-SES boys in numeracy partly arises because they benefit more than high-SES girls from attending pre-school . <h> sensible policy responses <p> Also , while the numeracy performance of high-SES boys is unaffected by school type , our research suggests that ( all else being equal ) high-SES girls attending Catholic schools have lower achievement in numeracy compared to high-SES girls attending government schools . Ensuring that educational practices do not favour one gender over the other could support girls ' achievement in numeracy . <p> In contrast , potential avenues for reducing gender gaps in reading may lie in the home . For example , reading to boys more often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a girl-only activity could help boys develop a taste for reading . <p> Identifying sensible policy responses to address gender gaps in early achievement are particularly important because the cumulative nature of the learning process has the potential to compound any gaps in achievement over time . <p> In particular the disadvantages faced by boys seem to have been overlooked by policy makers although they started lagging behind girls in educational attainment more than 50 years ago . This is especially worrying given that boys ' underachievement could pose serious threats to economic growth and social wellbeing in the future if it leads to higher drop-out rates , more mental health issues , more criminality or more unemployment . Of course , girls ' disadvantage in numeracy also needs to be addressed as it feeds into inequalities observed later on , such as investments in STEM ( science , technology , engineering and mathematics ) subjects , wages and glass ceiling effects . <p> However , there is still much to be done in order to uncover which mechanisms underlying the gender gaps are relatively more important and under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaps are due to the types of activities parents do with their children ( reading , cultural , sport ) and the transmission of gender stereotypes ?

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Taking the pulse of general practice <p> The number of GPs in Australia is falling in real terms , as the profession faces a crisis in morale <p> By Catriona May , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> The number of GPs in Australia is falling in real terms , as more and more medical graduates choose specialisations over general practice . <p> A major report from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research has found that , while the number of new GPs in Australia is growing relatively slowly , for every new GP there are nearly ten new specialists . <p> Professor Anthony Scott , who leads the team behind the report , says the trend could prove expensive in the long run , and has implications for patient care . <p> The Institute Health Sector Report is the first major report to consider the state of general practice in Australia . Picture : Pexels <p> " If we do n't have enough GPs , patients will end up in hospital more than they should , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see their GP they end up in the emergency department , where they 'll be seen by specialists . <p> " Specialists tend to do more procedures , which means more expense for the public purse . Potentially , patients may also end up receiving unnecessary treatments . " <p> The Institute Health Sector Report is the first major health check of general practice in Australia . It uses data collected through Medicare and the Institute 's Medicine in Australia : Balancing Employment and Life ( MABEL ) survey , which has been running for 10 years and includes data from over 10,000 doctors . <p> The results suggest general practice is still relatively unattractive to medical graduates , says Professor Scott . <p> " Money does matter , " he says . " Specialists are paid two-to-three times what most GPs are , and that 's the route junior doctors want to take . Often it is those who ca n't become specialists that move into general practice . <p> " Unfortunately , it 's seen as second fiddle to specialisation , in terms of reputation and earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation and at twice the rate of real wage growth , their work satisfaction is going down -- a trend researchers have observed since the introduction of the Medicare fee freeze in 2013 . <p> The fall in morale among GPs may be the most notable impact of the fee freeze ; there is no evidence to suggest patient fees are increasing or that the standard of patient care is declining . Nor has the freeze reduced GP earnings . In this context , the most likely explanation for the rise in GPs ' earnings is more efficiently managed practices . <p> " Falls in job satisfaction suggest decreasing morale which can , in turn , reduce the attractiveness of general practice as a career for junior doctors and compound difficulties in recruitment , " says Professor Scott . <p> Co-locating services like pathology within GP clinics can help practices balance the books . Picture : Wikimedia <p> " If this continues it could also drive more GPs away from being practice owners and encourage them to retire earlier than planned , creating issues for retention . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the co-location of services that pay rent , like pathology clinics , are contributing to their bottom line , " says Professor Scott . <p> " But this pressure for clinics to run efficiently , along with ongoing negative media and a perception that government policies are targeting general practice , may be contributing to GP 's declining rates of morale . " <p> Another trend identified in the report is the likely increase in corporatisation of general practice , as smaller , clinics are bought up by corporate entities . <p> The survey identified a drop in the number of general practices in Australia ( from just over 8,000 in 2002 to just over 7,000 in 2011 , the last year for which reliable data exists ) . It also found that the proportion of GPs working in a practice with six or more doctors has risen from 47 per cent in 2008 to 61 per cent in 2015 . <p> There are fewer , larger GP clinics in Australia as smaller clinics are bought up by corporates . Picture : Pexels <p> " On the one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resources , provide more onsite services for patients , and benefit from economies of scale and scope , " says Professor Scott . <p> " GPs themselves may also benefit from working there -- particularly women who are more likely to be working part-time and may prefer a job with a steady income over practice management or ownership . <p> " But their downside is they are larger and there are less of them , so patients may need to travel further to see their GP . " <p> The report also flags the ongoing challenge of attracting GPs to rural and remote areas of Australia . <p> " Without skilled migration , attracting doctors to rural areas is going to be even more challenging , " he says . <p> " While the government may want to ensure the increasing numbers of medical graduates all have a job , you simply ca n't force someone to work remotely if they do n't want to . " <p> General practice requires more support , says Professor Scott , particularly in light of the country 's ageing population and increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies that make specialisation less attractive for medical graduates , " he says . <p> " One way to do this would be to increase patient choice when GPs are making referrals . <p> " More transparency around specialist fee structures and increased patient choice would certainly be welcome -- it could increase competition among specialists and drive down their fees , narrowing the gap between what specialists University 's Privacy Officer at **30;56;TOOLONG

But opinion polls presuppose that people actually vote , and many who voted for unsuccessful candidates last time may not bother . The actual result may be a lot closer and there remains an outside chance of a Le Pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the French presidential campaign , but his win is by no means guaranteed . Picture : Getty Images <p> Who is this man Macron , most likely to be President of the nation with the world 's sixth largest economy , a permanent member of the UN Security Council , and a founding pillar of the European Union ? <p> We know he is very talented , but inexperienced in elected office . He did a Philosophy degree , a Masters of Public Affairs , and graduated from the elite training school for senior public officials , the ? cole Nationale d'Administration , in 2004 . After working for government and then the Rothschild bank , he served in successive ministries under Socialist Party President Fran ? ois Hollande , including as Minister of Economy , Industry and Digital Affairs in 2014-16 . He resigned to form his own party En Marche ! ( ' On the Move ! ' ) and to launch his bid in the 2017 presidential election . <p> Macron is married to Brigitte Trogneux , 24 years his senior ( almost the same age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melania Trump ) , who was his school drama teacher in their home town of Amiens . They live with her three children from a previous marriage . Her family has made biscuits -- the ' Amiens macaroon ' -- for generations and the social media wits have delighted in pointing out that it now has the Amiens Macron as well . <p> Macron insisted during his presidential campaign that he is neither right nor left , but rather a liberal . He means this in the sense of being progressive on social issues such as immigration and the environment but liberal on economic issues such as labour market reform and free trade . He has argued that old divisions of ' left ' and ' right ' have been replaced by those between ' progressives ' and ' conservatives ' . <p> The core of his programme is commitment to Europe , in stark contrast to Le Pen . Macron will look to a strengthened but streamlined Europe , continuing to work closely with Germany . He will see the Eurozone as the platform on which the French economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Brexit . He admires Germany 's Chancellor Angela Merkel and her willingness to embrace the challenge of mass movements of refugees . Asked by a journalist how he would ' face up ' to Merkel , he retorted ' I 'm not facing up to Berlin , I 'm with Berlin ' . <p> He has been a consistent champion of respect for freedom of all religions , and rebuffs suggestions that there should be tougher restrictions on the wearing of Muslim headscarves , while insisting that the public domain in France must be secular and its streets and borders safer . <p> He will be committed to the Paris agreement on climate change . Ahead of the 2015 conference he called for acceleration of the energy transition and advocated a ' balance between ecological imperatives and economic requirements ' , to be achieved by focusing on a range of initiatives , including the ' strengthening of energy efficiency and ... reduction of fossil fuels usage ' . <p> His outlook is not so different from liberal Americans -- he was elated to receive a phone call from former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and he is likely to be wary of complying with Trump policies in Syria and elsewhere . He will continue current French Prime Minister Francois Hollande 's critical position towards Israel . <p> Macron will have tough decisions to make . In France , the President directly names the Prime Minister and Cabinet . Given the readiness with which prominent politicians from the centre and centre-left have rushed to support him , he has a precious opportunity to choose the top people from a broad spectrum . Chances are it will be a dynamic and young team in the image of Macron himself . <p> Much will depend on the results of parliamentary elections , again over two rounds , on 11 and 18 June . Macron 's En Marche ! party ( often referred to simply as EM ! ) has been in existence only one year , and his small party apparatus have frantically been vetting applications to stand for the party in the 577 electorates from as many as 35,000 hopefuls .

The political makeup of the National Assembly will determine how far Macron can push his agenda , and indeed the direction of that agenda itself . <p> Whatever the case , Macron faces challenges that have proved too great for his predecessors for 40 years , and which confront most of Europe : what can be done about long-term double digit unemployment , hitting at least 25 per cent of young people ? How can deep rifts and mistrust be healed between unemployed , disaffected young people from migrant backgrounds , particularly North Africans ?

Photo : Getty <p> In addition , his plan is to promote the creation of a 5,000-strong force of EU border guards , but to continue freedom of movement of goods and labour across the EU because it boosts cross border revenue . <p> This will disappoint rural and former industrial area voters who want their government to retake control of France 's borders from the EU , slash immigration , and who have little interest in mobility across borders . The President -- elect will need to demonstrate that his plans will deliver solutions for unemployment caused by industry automation , and demonstrate that it is not necessarily caused by free trade and economic integration . <h> German elections and geopolitical turmoil may bring hurdles <p> Since last year 's Brexit vote , the remaining 27 EU member states have found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discuss new models of cooperation .

It may therefore also hinder President-elect Macron 's plans . <p> Consider also the vastly unpredictable geopolitical context , here to stay for several years through the current US Presidency ; Russia 's increasing expansionism ; China 's moves ; and tension with North Korea -- and we need more than ever a strong Europe that provides a level playing field for recovery and stability . <p> Not an easy time to start one 's presidency in a country of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values have won , but proving the electorate made the right choice is absolutely vital . <p> This article has been co-published with the University University 's Privacy Officer at **30;507;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> Sharks : How a cull could ruin an ecosystem <p> As a Senate inquiry looks into minimising shark attacks , we consider what happens when humans meddle with this apex predator <p> By Alana Schetzer , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> An Australian summer rarely passes without another chilling headline about a shark attack . And while the first response to the now seemingly regular attacks is to call for a cull , killing them is not the answer . <p> A Senate inquiry is currently considering the range of options to manage the risk of shark attacks . And while culling is an understandable response from people scared of these predators - there is no evidence that shedding numbers reduces the likelihood of an attack . <p> In fact , the killing of sharks in high numbers can devastate oceanic ecosystems , leading to plummeting populations and serious environmental consequences . <h> Tipping the delicate oceanic ecosystem out of balance <p> Associate Professor Robert Day , a marine biologist in the School of BioSciences at the University of Melbourne , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ocean , if their numbers are reduced everything goes out of balance . <p> " The top predators in any ecosystem are very important because they decide on whether other creatures become numerous or not , " he says . <p> " If there is a lack of sharks , then fish and other ocean creatures that would otherwise be consumed by sharks will become too numerous and eat too many smaller creatures and so on , meaning that the whole ecosystem changes massively . " <p> Sharks also tend to select sick , old or weak prey , reducing the risk of disease and strengthening gene pools . They also scavenge , clearing the water of decomposing debris . <p> There is another fascinating benefit they provide , with the bigger shark species using their size to intimidate and regulate the behaviour of their prey , stopping them from overusing certain habitats . Hawaiian researchers have proven that tiger sharks help keep sea grass beds healthy by eating , and therefore limiting , the number of turtles that would otherwise overgraze . <h> But culling sharks would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Actually , no . <p> Not only does culling sharks present an immediate environmental problem , but a cull is also extremely unlikely to actually prevent future attacks . <p> Statistically , there is no need for shark culls . According to the Shark Attack File , which tracks shark attacks and fatalities across Australia , there were 26 attacks and four fatalities in 2016 . Worldwide , there is an average of 10 deaths per year due to sharks . <p> This is compared to the estimated 100 million sharks killed by humans annually , mostly for the food industry and for sport . <p> It 's also important to keep in mind Australia 's fast-growing population , which means that more people are going to the beach , which of course will increase any risk of a shark encounter . In just 64 years , Australia 's population has exploded , from 8.3 million people in 1950 , to 23.5 million in 2014 . <p> But despite years of research and evidence proving that shark encounters , let alone fatal shark attacks , are incredibly rare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed in order for people to be safe , continues . <h> The devastating consequences of culling young sharks <p> Professor Day says that shark populations can suffer significant problems following culls and commercial fishing because of the risk of catching immature species . <p> Most shark species take a long time to reach maturity , especially the larger species such as the great white and tiger sharks ; Professor Days says that bull sharks take about 15 years to reach maturity . Shark species living closest to the surface , which are more likely to be targeted in a cull , also take a long time to mature .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> The <p> A crack team of international scientists are dedicated to fighting the flu , tracking its many mutations across the globe <p> By Catriona May , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Deep in the University of Melbourne 's biomedical precinct , a team of influenza specialists wait in a state of constant readiness , analysing thousands of samples from around the world . <p> Every year , they 're on the lookout for the next pandemic . <p> This team of are one of five World Health Organisation Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza , tasked with the relentless monitoring of the virus as it changes form ; its ability to shape-shift its greatest weapon against our immune systems . <p> Professor Kanta Subbarao is the Director of the Melbourne World Health Organisation Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza . Picture : Paul of Melbourne <p> Together , the five reference centres are responsible for developing the annual flu vaccine -- the only vaccine updated every year . It is , essentially , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team monitors how the virus is changing each season and updates the next year 's vaccine accordingly . <p> The centres track everything from the proportion of patients visiting participating GPs with flu-like symptoms ( defined as a fever , a cough and one more respiratory symptom ) , to patients hospitalised with flu , and outbreaks in concentrated areas like retirement homes . <p> " We recommend countries send us viruses if there 's anything unusual , as well as representative samples from the season . Right now we 're asking for four shipments a year -- we typically receive about 4,000 samples a year . " <p> The Melbourne centre mainly receives samples from the Asia-Pacific region . The throat and nasal swabs are packaged carefully and shipped on dry ice ; they all have the potential to become the next vaccine candidate and must be handled with incredible care . <p> The Peter Doherty Centre for Immunity and Infection in Melbourne stores tens of thousands of samples of influenza collected primarily from the Asia Pacific region . Picture : Paul Burston <p> The other four reference centres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year they meet ; in February to recommend the vaccine strain for the northern hemisphere winter , and in September for the southern hemisphere . From there , it takes six months to develop the vaccine . <p> " The two vaccines are often similar , but very often three of the four components might stay the same , and we change one , " says Professor Subbarao . <p> The vaccine has to be updated annually because of a process known as antigenic drift ; where flu changes its appearance , accumulating mutations that alter the proteins around the outside of its virion ( the infectious particle of the virus ) . It essentially tricks the body into re-infection , even in people who have previously had flu . <p> When we are infected with the flu virus , as with all viruses , our bodies ' immune response kicks in . The first time a person is infected there is no pre-existing immunity so the virus succeeds . After a few days of infection , our B cells and T cells have multiplied to fight it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus , binding to the flu to stop it infecting more cells . T cells take up the fight and destroy the infected cells altogether . <p> After someone has been infected once with a strain of flu , their B and T cells remember it . So if they encounter that strain again , they are activated to fight it immediately , preventing reinfection . <p> The goal of the current flu vaccination program is to produce these antibodies to prevent infection . However , because flu is a master of disguise , it can often escape existing antibody immunity . <p> Deputy Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne , Professor Ian Barr , with some of the flu samples stored by the centre . Picture : Paul of Melbourne <p> This means the WHO flu-fighters are locked into constant surveillance of the virus , in a massively resource-intensive exercise . It also means the vaccine 's efficacy varies from year to year . Some years the team is able to predict the virus ' that will circulate next season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 60 per cent . <p> " The vaccine 's effectiveness depends on how well it is matched to what circulates -- whether we have predicted correctly , " says Professor Subbarao . <p> " The other important factor is the age of the recipient -- the vaccine is not as effective in the elderly , which is really unfortunate because the elderly and very young are the most at risk of severe complications of influenza . " <p> And then there 's the constant threat of the next pandemic , the most recent of which was the 2009 outbreak of swine flu , originating in North America . The most devastating flu pandemic on record was the Spanish flu of 1918 , which killed between 20 and 50 million people ; more people than the First World War . <p> Pandemics occur through a process called antigenic shift , where the entire genetic make-up of the virus shifts and a new strain emerges -- always originating from an animal host . The WHO team are on constant alert for such a strain , but there is very little warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 we were all watching for a new bird flu strain , but then the pandemic came from pigs , " says Professor Subbarao . " When we get an antigenic shift event , we basically have to start afresh with a completely new strain . <p> " We 're always looking for any totally novel influenza virus . " <p> The knock-out punch for flu would be the development of a universal vaccine -- something that has a vast international research effort behind it . And while there has been significant progress in the lab , it is still some time until such a product becomes available . <p> " The science behind it is very exciting , " says Professor Subbarao . " I think we will see a universal flu vaccine . Our current vaccines are not working as well as they should in the population at greatest risk , so we have to do better . <p> " I think it 'll be an incremental process ; we may add things to the current vaccines to improve their protective scope and then eventually there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universal vaccine strategies will not prevent infection ; they are designed to prevent serious disease and death by targeting B or T cell immunity . <p> Very large clinical trials would be required to prove such a strategy prevents flu-related hospitalisation and death compared to a seasonal vaccine , which is a significant hurdle to overcome . <p> " There 's a bit of a stand-off between where we are with the science and bringing a product to market at the moment , " says Professor Subbarao . <p> " There is an enormous amount of work that has to happen between exciting science and producing a final product , and that can take up to ten to twenty years , and billions of dollars .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> A trade in desperation : The rise of stem cell tourism <p> Book extract : As medicine and health care around the world undergo major changes , a new book " Stem Cell Tourism and the Political Economy of Hope " looks at the rise of people travelling in the hope of a cure <p> In Australia , in recent years , there have been a number of news reports of patients and carers travelling overseas for stem cell treatments . Their journeys are part of a wider international trend , commonly referred to as stem cell tourism , whereby patients and their carers travel across geographical borders and jurisdictions to receive treatments that are experimental or clinically unproven , and hence , may not be available to them where they live . <p> The stories features in the news are often framed within a now-familiar narrative -- desperate patients full of hope investing in treatments that promise much , and scientists and doctors voicing frustrations about entrepreneurial ' charlatans ' or ' cowboys ' operating at the margins of medicine and exploiting ' regulatory loopholes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients travel for stem cell treatment if unproven methods are unavailable in their home country . Photo : CSIRO <p> Why , authorities ask , do patients and carers embark on such treatments that are unlikely to provide benefit , are expensive , and potentially in inflict great harm ? <h> The Immediate Aftermath of Diagnosis <p> By their accounts , patients and carers tended to embark on the search for information , about the condition itself and about treatment options , very soon after diagnosis , and often in the absence of definitive expert advice . <p> Ivan , a of a child with cerebral palsy , articulated a commonly expressed view ; namely , that ' no one gave us any real direction so we sort of had to do all the research ourselves ' . <p> Research can be long and tortuous , spanning in some cases a period of years , and take individuals and their families down numerous avenues , and sometimes ' blind alleys ' . Their post-diagnostic experience is thus in many respects similar to that of other patients , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , the rise of the internet and social media , along with the burgeoning number of online resources , has radically changed the architecture of ' choice ' . During their investigations , patients and carers encounter an array of online resources , found primarily via search engines such as Google , and information provided by disease-specific patient communities , individual patients and their families , as well as information offered by providers on their websites . <p> A number mentioned the importance of Facebook for sharing information , and YouTube videos and blogs for finding relevant sources . Through these avenues , and invariably after being advised of their limited options by their treating doctors after diagnosis , individuals soon came to the realisation that their options for proven treatment in Australia were limited or non-existent . <p> The nature of the condition and the prognosis constrain options and the potential and urgency to pursue those that are available . Individuals who embark on a stem cell treatment are in most cases struggling with severe , life-limiting conditions ( e.g. spinal cord injury , motor neurone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminal and , for many , time is of the essence . <p> As one patient , Greg , with a progress degenerative neurological disease affecting movement , explained in relation to his decision to pursue stem cell treatment in China : ' If you 're in a condition like mine or cancer ... you will try these sorts of things . If you have n't got a condition like that you tend to be more sceptical . ' <p> As he reasoned , stem cell treatment ' seemed to have more going for it ' than ' the whole range of things out there ' and , as they were financially able to undertake treatment , ' Well , why not try it now while I can ? ' . <p> Some patients say they are left to do all the research themselves . Photo : Shutterstock <p> At least in one case , an element of pragmatism played a role in the decision to undertake stem cell treatment . Parents of a child with cerebral palsy , Ivan and Vlasta , said they had explored and tried various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different -- a ' sort of more attractive way of try and give him a little boost ' -- thereby obviating the need for intensive , time- consuming daily therapy . As they explained , ' We 're very busy people and running a business , and we have very little time to ourselves ' . This pragmatism also appeared to be a factor in their decision to take their child for treatment in Germany and China . <p> In their search for options , some individuals experimented with diets and complementary and alternative therapies . <p> Two patients -- a patient with multiple sclerosis and a mother-carer of a child with autism -- mentioned that their research had uncovered the role of nutrition , which had led them to exclude gluten and dairy from their diet , which they felt had resulted in improvements in health . <p> In the latter case , as in a number of others , stem cell treatment was seen as additional to rather than supplanting complementary and alternative therapies -- as one of an array of options that was seen as worth exploring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' packages ' , which included a range of therapies beyond Western biomedicine ( i.e. acupuncture , massage , traditional Chinese medicine ) in addition to stem cells , were particularly attractive and influenced their decision of where to travel . <h> The Perception of ' No Choice ' <p> The lack of stem cell treatment options in Australia was often cited as being crucial in the decision to travel overseas . Many individuals commented or implied that stem cell treatment should have been available to them in Australia and , since it was not , they felt that they had ' no choice ' but to seek treatment overseas . <p> One carer , Donna , whose partner suffered a rare neurological condition , when asked about the benefits for people travelling overseas for stem cell treatments , responded : ' Well you ca n't get it here so you do n't really have a choice . If you want to try it ... well you do n't have a choice ' . <p> A patient who had spinal cord injury , Axel , expressed similar sentiments when explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there 's no treatment available in Australia now and there wo n't be for a long time ... we 've got no choice but to go over- seas to get treatment in the future . ' <p> Indeed , some described feeling ' desperate ' about their situation , underlining the anguish that they experienced . As we explain , this sense of abandonment , loss of hope and/or desperation does not always lead to the decision to pursue treatment ; however , for virtually all , this perceived hopelessness and limited options or ' no choice ' in Australia defined the context within which decisions were made . <p> Banner image : In Pictures Ltd. /Corbis via Getty Images <p> This is an edited book extract from Stem Cell Tourism and the Political Economy of Hope whichis published by Palgrave Macmillan .

 <h> The battle for academic freedom in Europe <p> Glyn Davis G'day , I 'm Glyn Davis and this is The Policy Shop , a place where we think about policy choices . <p> Presenter Tens of thousands of Hungarians took to the streets to protest a new law that could force the Central European University , one of the few independent academic institutions in Hungary , to shut down . <p> Man We believe we 're fighting for Hungarian higher education . We 're fighting for the freedom of academic institutions across Europe and across the world . <p> Woman It is very clear that it is attacking CEU , but it goes beyond that . It 's basically about the liberty of education and ultimately of the academics there . And this is basically a red line that is being stepped over right now by the government . <p> TV presenter All this is happening within the heart of the European Union . Where respect for human rights , democracy , freedom and the rule of law are membership conditions , set in stone . <p> Glyn Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just three years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , and the vision for the University , which was founded by the Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros , was to build and support open and democratic societies that respect human rights and the rule of law . <p> Over the past 25 years from its location in the heart of Hungary 's capital Budapest , the Central European University has grown to be a unique international institution . But now the very future of this university is under threat as the Hungarian government - led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb ? n - has announced new higher education laws . Laws the university says , are a premeditated political attack on a free institution and threaten its very survival . <p> Some of the largest demonstrations Hungary has seen since the fall of communism have occurred , with 80,000 people marching in support of the University in Budapest recently . Internationally over 500 prominent US and European academics , including 20 Nobel Laureates , have signed an open letter in support of the Central European University and the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungary , as the curtain seems to be coming down on academic freedom in Central Europe . <p> To discuss this challenge faced by the Central European University I am delighted be joined on the line from Budapest by the former leader of the Liberal party in Canada , the Edward R Murrow Professor of Practice of the Press Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University , and the current president and rector of the Central European University , Professor Michael Ignatieff . <p> Michael , welcome to the podcast . <p> Michael Ignatieff Nice to be here <p> Glyn Davis Michael , why is this issue of such importance , not just in Hungary , but globally ? <p> Michael Ignatieff Well , I think it 's the case that academic freedom is under attack globally . I think academics often think of academic freedom as if it was just the privilege of a bunch of tenured professors . But in fact academic freedom is a lynchpin of democratic society itself . <p> One of our oldest ideas of democracy is in fact the idea that the institutions inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-governing institutions in the world is the university . I mean Oxford , Bologna , the Sorbonne were founded 1000 years ago , and were the first models of self-governing communities in Europe . <p> And I think now in the 21st Century in Russia , in Turkey , in Hungary , in a number of other places , authoritarian leaders or liberal democrats are attacking universities because universities are free institutions . Once you 've attacked a free press , once you 've attacked the courts , what 's your next attack point ? It 's going to be a university . So we see what 's happening in Hungary as part of a much wider global pattern , and that 's why I think it should be of concern to Australians . <p> Glyn Davis So the Hungarian government is justifying its new rules as removing an unfair advantage it feels the CEU enjoys because although it operates in both Hungary and the US , it does n't have a United States campus . How do you respond to these claims that these are not attacks on academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Michael Ignatieff Well , they would say that , would n't they ? I think the issue of us not having a US campus , for example , ignores the fact that there are 30 American institutions working overseas awarding American degrees overseas . <p> Think the American University of Cairo , the American University of Beirut , the American University of Central Asia , all of these institutions do not have campuses in the United States . We 're just one of 30 . So we do n't actually understand why there is any educational justification for the Hungarian government insisting that we educate , for example Hungarian students in New York . We 'd prefer to educate them in Budapest . <p> The basic claim that they 're making is that they want to level the playing field between us and other Hungarian institutions . But we 're not in competition with other Hungarian institutions . We work extremely well with them , enjoy our relations with them , want to deepen our relationships with them , and are not in competition . What they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue American accredited masters and doctorates , that 's the core issue . They want to take away a - not a right , but something we 've done for 25 years . <p> The reason students come from 120 countries to study in Budapest is that they get an American accredited masters and doctorate , and that 's what this government wants to take away . If they succeed this looks to us like an infringement of academic freedom in the specific sense that whatever else the university should be free to do , it should be free to award the degrees that it can secure international accreditation for . So we are resisting that very publicly and very overtly . <p> Glyn Davis So why is the Hungarian government so concerned about American degrees ? <p> Michael Ignatieff You 'd have to ask them . I think what they want is an institution firmly under their control . If you have American accreditation you have a guarantee of your independence and freedom . They 're basically saying , you can stay in Hungary provided you make yourself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While we love being in Hungary , and have a deep respect for the best traditions of Hungarian academic life . I mean let me open a little parenthesis , remember what Hungary has contributed to the academic and intellectual life of the world , it 's enormous . <p> Glyn Davis Indeed <p> Michael Ignatieff We simply do n't trust what life would be like under this regime , because this regime has weakened the rule of law , weakened the free press . It has an absolute majority in parliament . The legislation that affects us , for example , was introduced on March 28 without any consultation , without any warning , without any of the kind of normal procedures that a democratic society would welcome . I mean if in Australia the government changes the rules relating to universities , they get the universities in and you talk it through and you go back and forward , and you , as it were , consult . None of that occurred . <p> They passed the legislation in a week . It was signed into law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So in that context where essentially a government has the capacity to use law any way it wants , we just feel if we do n't have the guarantees of academic freedom created by these American degrees we simply wo n't be safe and secure in Budapest . That 's why we 're fighting it . <p> Glyn Davis So the Hungarian government 's been really keen to link CEU to George Soros , who of course provided original funding for the institution , and therefore did denigrate it . But you 've been in conflict since 2015 when Hungary became the epicentre of the European refugee and migrant crisis . The Hungarian government of course erected a steel fence along its southern border while your university offered scholarships to Syrian citizens and open language classes . How much is this actually a fundamental argument about the role of a university in society ? <p> Michael Ignatieff Well , I think it is a fundamental debate about the role of a university in society . We do provide educational services to legally admitted refugees and migrants . We would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are here illegally . But we educate about 50 refugees and migrants every semester , and we 're very proud of that work . <p> It connects to the work that we 've done over 25 years , for example , in educating Roma people who are among the most educationally deprived populations in Europe . We 're a serious university with a serious research tradition . We 're not a charitable enterprise , but we 're proud of this outreach work . I think it bothers the government , because the government has an extremely strong anti-migrant and migration control policy . <p> This is the elected government of the country . They 're free to pursue the policies they want . But we are also free , and must be free , to provide educational services to those who need it desperately . If you 're in university life , as I 've been most of my life , you want to see real hunger for learning , just look at a refugee studying in a classroom . These people are desperate to use education to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're confined . We think it 's an absolutely key demonstration of what university should be for . <p> You also raised the issue of our founder Mr Soros . We 're able to oppose this legislation because we 're privately endowed . But I do n't take orders from Mr Soros . I am accountable to a board of trustees . Mr Soros has respected our academic freedom a good deal better than the prime minister of Hungary , I can tell you . <p> Glyn Davis He 's certainly raised the stakes because earlier this year he denounced , and I quote , " the globalists and liberals , the powerbrokers sitting in their palaces , the swarm of media locusts and their owners who are getting involved in Hungary . " So there 's a strong anti-foreign feeling here . While in a recent opinion piece in The Guardian historian Timothy Garton Ash responded by saying , " we know the price of appeasement , that is why we must stand up to Viktor Orb ? n " . <p> Michael , how do you reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is with such deeper historical memories and in such a context how challenging does it make it to find a solution ? <p> Michael Ignatieff Well , the escalation of the language does make it more difficult . I have n't minced my words in opposition to what the government 's doing . The risk always is that it 's not just that you escalate the rhetoric , but they then perceive you to be engaged in a challenge to a duly elected government . We 're making no such challenge to a duly elected government . I 'm trying not to play politics with this . My sole objective is to preserve this university in Budapest . If they leave me alone I 'll definitely leave them alone . <p> But academic freedom is not best defended by lying down . If you do n't stand up and fight for yourself you will be steamrolled . I think Australians understand that , and pretty well everybody who 's heard this story understands it . That 's why we have universities around the world who have sent us letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So thank you Australia for your support . <p> The rhetoric on the other side is , Mr Orb ? n 's rhetoric is , anti-globalist , anti-liberal , anti-capitalist . He 's raised the stakes and sees this battle over a little university as part of a much larger framework . Fine , he 's an elected politician , he 's entitled to frame it any way he wants . My problem is that I do n't see why a university should be taken hostage by any political agenda , whatever . I 've got no business quarrelling with his agenda , but I do have the right to quarrel when he takes my institution hostage to serve his political ends . That 's what we 're fighting . <p> Glyn Davis You 've relied heavily on Karl Popper 's Open Society and Its Enemies . ' If we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant , then the tolerant will be destroyed and tolerance with them ' wrote Karl Popper . <p> Clearly the ideals behind the Central European University resonate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're no doubt asking yourself - as we are in the rest of the world - is , given the rise of intolerance , is this a sign that universities have failed in some important and historic sense to change the conversation in the societies that we 're part of ? <p> Michael Ignatieff Well , I do n't think so . I mean a little footnote here , I always find it amusing when we talk about a society 's conversations . Actually it 's much rougher than that , it 's argy-bargy , push-pull . It 's a political struggle . It always has been , it always will be . A university 's role I think is to try and provide the knowledge , the facts , the research , the science upon which public policy should be based . I think most of the time universities , and university professors and students , do their jobs . That is they say , what is the knowledge that we need to turn to in order to solve these disputes ? <p> But I do n't think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get listened to . I mean we 're not in a conversation , we 're in a vital argument about the future of , say , Australian society or Canadian society or Hungarian society . In arguments voices are bound to be raised . Knowledge is the last thing anybody pays any attention to when you 're trying to win an argument . Some of these arguments look like fights in a bar room . I 've been in politics and I do n't have any pious illusions about how rough it gets . <p> But I do come out of my own experience of having been an academic who went into politics and came out , of an absolute passionate belief in the importance of what universities do , which is , if we do our jobs right we can be the still , calm voice that says , look , there are some facts in the matter here . Here are the facts as best we can find it out , and if you want to make rational choices in this societies , choices that are based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we 've played a recurrent role in the last 70 years or 80 years , despite the fact that our conversations are getting noisier and more aggressive and more ignorant and more Facebook driven . <p> It is still the case that knowledge is the crucial decider in making good public policy choice . We need to teach our students that there is such a thing as knowledge . It 's not just one Tweet versus another . There are some facts , there are some things that are true and there are some things that are false . Standing for those principles seems to be more important than ever . If we give up on that then we really will have abandoned the societies we 're supposed to serve . <p> Glyn Davis The still calm voice is a wonderful way of putting the role . Of course theoretically under European law , Hungary should be respecting what you 're doing . Article 13 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights would appear to give you a right to unfettered or unconstrained research and scientific work . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the movement of academics and students , looking at restrictions in the United States , restrictions in the UK , and increasingly restrictions in Australia as well . <p> Michael Ignatieff Well , I think the issue of visa control and immigration control is now , I think , one of the most pressing potential threats to academic freedom right around the world . <p> Glyn Davis Yep <p> Michael Ignatieff In the United States institutions of higher learning - I was at Harvard - now have to struggle with visa restrictions on seven essentially Muslim countries . There are a lot of great Yemeni students who are I think , Sudanese students , who are just not going to be able to get into American higher education because of these visa controls . I do n't know the situation in Australia , but Australia has made a fantastic success of its higher education system . You 're drawing students from around the world . It 's one of the best things that Australia has done . <p> When I was in Canadian politics we used to look enviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering . It would be a great concern in Australia , in Canada , in the United States , but also in Hungary if governments begin to - for legitimate security reasons - begin to so clamp down on student visas that basically they shut down one of the great successes of a globalised world which is the global classroom . I mean I have students from 120 countries in my university . They come from literally pretty well everywhere . <p> The experience of being in a classroom where there 's no ' we ' in the classroom , where the ' we ' has to be created by debate , argument , mutual encounter is just a priceless benefit that the globalisation of education has succeeded . Now let 's be clear , let 's be honest with ourselves , there are some very legitimate reasons of state why governments have to exercise appropriate visa control . But it would be terrible if under the pretext of security we begin to get essentially filters on who universities can accept . Filters that essentially become , as the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We start banning Muslims simple because we 're Muslims , it 's a direct threat to academic freedom . <p> If we start banning people from countries simply because they 're on some watch list that will negatively impact the freedom of students to come and learn with us . Universities do have to stand up and say , on the one hand we understand that Australia needs to be protected from the terrorist threat ; we get this . But please understand how wonderful it 's been for Australia to have these foreign students . These foreign students are almost 99.9 per cent of the time not a security threat , they 're an asset to the country . They become great ambassadors for Australia when they go home to their country . <p> It 's what I say here in Hungary . We get 1500 students into Budapest every year . Every one of them loves Budapest and goes out of Hungary saying , what a fantastic country it is . I 'm trying to convince the government , that 's a good thing , not a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake , right . <p> We have to get up there as academics and be proud of what we do , proud of the ways in which we provide a good advertisement for our country overseas . Stand up to government when it uses security grounds that then become a kind of throttle on the capacity of the universities to do their job . <p> Glyn Davis So how confident are you about the survival of not just CEU , but of the European ideal around universities ? For example , the election of Emmanuel Macron to the French presidency , does this provide some hope that the tide may turn ? <p> Michael Ignatieff Well , Emmanuel Macron as a candidate made a very clear statement in defence of academic freedom in Hungary , for which we were extremely grateful . I need a little more support from European member states . I 'd like some phone calls to the prime minister 's office saying , cut it out , knock it off , stop this nonsense . <p> But I am relatively optimistic that sanity will eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-harm . I mean we 've been part of Hungarian academic life for 25 years . Pushing us out will do the whole country 's academic system harm . So we hope that the government will see reason . <p> Whether the European ideal will prevail against this constant flouting of European norms and European values is another question . But even there , the centre right parties that with whom the Hungarian government are aligned have stated very clearly that they disagree with the Hungarian government . So again I 'm cautiously optimistic that , over time , the Hungarian government , faced with a choice basically between being in Europe or being out of Europe , will choose to be in Europe and therefore choose to conform to European values and norms . <p> Glyn Davis So Michael , there 's been speculation that the changes signed by the Hungarian president will be appealed in the Hungarian Constitutional Court . How do you see the next steps from here , and how confident are you that an independent judicial decision might be able to resolve this ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumption that this is a democratic society with constitutional norms and constitutional protections . I want to take the process very seriously . We 've filed an amicus curiae brief with the constitutional court here . We 've made an appeal to a thing called the Venice Commission , which is an international body which advises the court . <p> But we have to be honest with the fact that the court is appointed by the Hungarian government and so this is a very political context . I do n't want to prejudge outcomes . We believe we have a very strong case that the law is discriminatory , and a violation of the Hungarian basic law . <p> I want to wait and see what the judges do . I hope this will create a channel towards a resolution . In a month we have not had any direct negotiations with the Hungarian government at all . Negotiations were promised , negotiations are announced , but no actual negotiations are occurring . Until they actually occur I do n't know whether I can predict a successful outcome . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listeners how anxious we are just to get back to work and do what universities do , which is teach and learn and research . <p> Glyn Davis You 've been very clear that Budapest is your home . I 'm aware that the Freie University of Berlin has reached out with the offer of a site for relocation . I guess are there circumstances in which you 'd consider a move to another European country ? <p> Michael Ignatieff Well , if we ca n't give the degrees that we want , if we ca n't hire the people we want , if we 're subjected to vexatious interference every step of the way , of course we 'll have to leave . But I 've said from the beginning , this really is our home . We have a pretty visceral attachment to Budapest . <p> To repeat something I said earlier but which I feel passionately about , there are few countries in Europe that have made a more incredible academic and intellectual contribution to European civilisation than Hungary . If you think about the mathematicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writers , the artists , the photographers , it 's just an astoundingly creative country . We 've loved being part of it and playing our little role . So I just hope they wo n't be stupid . <p> Of course we 've had offers of homes in other cities . I got a nice letter this morning from the mayor of Gdansk in Poland . This is one of the pleasures of being the president of CEU , every day you open up and somebody 's offering you a nice new location in another city . But with great respect to Gdansk , and to the other places who have offered including Berlin , we really want to stay here and expand and grow and welcome hopefully Australian students , if you will allow this direct naked plug on your podcast . <p> Glyn Davis You did have that character . <p> Michael Ignatieff Yes , so we hope we 'll be here in a year 's time . I ca n't guarantee that we will , but that 's our objective . <p> Glyn Davis Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? tre of politics is freedom . How hopeful are you of the independence of academic freedom at a time when it seems to be more and more under threat ? <p> Michael Ignatieff Well , I think Hannah Arendt is right , the very purpose of politics is freedom , and not just defending our freedom but creating the conditions of freedom for everybody and for those of us around us . But the lesson I 've taken from this , what I regard as a sorry episode , is that you ca n't defend academic freedom unless you 're prepared to stand up and fight . Draw clear red lines and stand up and defend yourself . I think sometimes universities are apologetic . University is under a tremendous pressure from state funders , from legislators , from the press - from all these kind of people . <p> We get slightly too apologetic about our role . We get slightly too humble about our role . We have many paymasters , and so often we let paymasters dictate what we do . Sometimes we let politicians dictate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we do that for which freedom is the absolute precondition . The core of what we do is the defence , protection , enhancement and enlargement of that little sphere we call knowledge . Unless a society has a secure knowledge basis upon which to make social choice , it really is flying blind . We 're like the eyes and ears of a society when we do our job properly . <p> Sometimes we have to stand up and defend this role , and defend it against all-comers . That 's what I 've learned with this experience in Budapest . <p> Glyn Davis It 's been a huge pleasure speaking with my distinguished guest at a challenging time for him , his staff , and of course his students .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Digital disruption and the Law <p> Balancing tradition with innovation in a fast-changing industry is a challenge for legal educators <p> By Professor Carolyn Evans , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> The legal profession is finally experiencing the digital disruption that has swept through so many industries over the last decade . It 's transforming all aspects of lawyering , creating new ways of working in new markets with new roles and opening up new opportunities while traditional conventions wane . <p> Law graduates who understand the impact of digital innovations and are comfortable working with technology will be at an advantage with employers . So legal education needs to provide students with the technical skills to thrive in the digital world , and also the ability to navigate the complex ethical , legal and social implications of new technologies . <p> While our future lawyers need to work in a digital world , it remains all the more important to recognise the value of some important elements of traditional legal education including research , critical thinking and analytical skills . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to thrive in a rapidly changing world . <p> New technologies are changing how the law is practised around the world . Picture : Tori Rector/ Flickr <p> There are areas where the digital transformation will be significant ; we 're already seeing the impact in discovery , where artificial intelligence is both replacing work product from lawyers and at the same time improving the experience of law practice . <p> Other changes might create new types of legal work in new markets , for example , providing online high volume , low cost advice to under-served constituencies . At Melbourne Law School , for example , the students in our Law Apps class work in teams with not-for-profit clients to develop on-line legal information sources to provide assistance to those who might otherwise struggle to understand their legal rights and duties . <p> Other aspects of the law , however , will remain more complex and nuanced and require greater human input than predicted by those who foresee the end of traditional law firms . As legal educators , we need to draw on the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Some of the traditional values of high quality legal education remain pertinent ( maybe even increasingly so ) in a rapidly changing world . These elements should not be sacrificed when looking at reforms although , the precise way in which they are taught may need some modification . <p> The nature of legal research , for example , might be changing , but the need for high-quality research skills is not . <p> A careless and ill-defined search can give rise to a torrent of barely relevant , unimportant materials from around the world . The poorly trained law graduate haplessly reproduces as much of it as possible hoping that the right answer will mysteriously arise from the sea of information . <p> Students must understand the questions they are researching ; have a deep familiarity with the best research tools for the particular task ; understand the hierarchies at play in terms of court structures and forms of law ; and have good judgment about which sources to use and when . None of these skills is straightforward and all of them require a serious educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Creating opportunities for serious , deep and structured interdisciplinary experiences is another important aspect of contemporary legal education . It is likely interdisciplinary groups will give rise to the most innovative workplaces and solve the most intractable problems of our time . <p> The legal profession is steeped in tradition ; the pace of change is a challenge for many . Picture : Pixabay <p> For a profession in which development has tended to be evolutionary and incremental for much of its history , the legal profession is now faced with a pace of change that has put serious pressure on many lawyers . As law firms examine their practices and adjust to the new world , other competitors and new ways of providing legal advice emerge . The pattern of change and challenge to the existing ways of doing things is likely to continue indefinitely . <p> Law schools likewise face challenges in responding to this new environment . With the number of graduate places for young lawyers diminishing , they must focus on both readying their students for those places and also preparing them for other roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In adapting to meet these new challenges , it is important law schools recognise that some of the traditional skills they impart to students will continue to be valuable for a long time to come . But neither can they close their eyes to the environment into which students are graduating and they need to be innovative and responsive in creating opportunities for students to develop new skills sets that will set them up to succeed even as the expectations of lawyers continues to shift over time . <p> To mark Law Week ( 15 -- 21 May 2017 ) , Pursuit is looking at some of the issues facing the University 's Privacy Officer at **30;31;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> Q&amp;A : The ransomware cyber-attack fallout <p> Computers in 150 countries were attacked by WannaCry ransomware -- we ask the experts what we 've learned from the worldwide hack <p> Share selection to : <p> Tech giant Microsoft has warned the global cyber-attack targeting 150 countries and more than 200,000 computers is a ' wake-up call ' for governments worldwide . <p> The attack , which began on Friday , May 12 , has seen businesses crippled by ransomware infecting their computers . The virus , WannaCry , took control of users ' files and demanded payment to restore access . <p> But the head of the European Union 's law enforcement agency , Europol , says the number of victims is still rising as the ' worm ' continues to spread across networks . <p> We asked University of Melbourne experts Dr Vanessa Teague , Dr Chris Culnane and Dr Toby Murray , from the School of Computing and Information Systems , what we 've learned from the attack and what it means for future security online . <p> The virus hit computers in 150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ransomware and how did this attack work ? <p> A : Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the data on your hard disk in order to hold you to ransom . In order to get the decryption key a victim is asked to make a bitcoin payment . <p> This malware is distributed via infected email attachments as well as links to malicious websites . It then propagates through a network using a security hole in Windows . Once infected , the malware will access all hard disks and attached storage , encrypting your files and removing the unencrypted versions . <p> Q : This attack seems more widespread than previous hacks . Is that the case or is it just more visible ? <p> A : This is much more sophisticated than previous ransomware attacks , which have relied predominantly on victims opening malicious email attachments . <p> The malware used in this attack is an adaptation of tools from the United States ' National Security Agency ( NSA ) . The agency 's toolkit was stolen -- the theft revealed when a hacking group calling itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some of the information was made public , while they also attempted to auction off a set of tools . The exact date of the theft , and who was ultimately responsible for it , is not publicly known -- and the attempt to auction off the exploit tools was not particularly successful , resulting in a number of tools being leaked by the group publicly in January . <p> The exploit used in this attack was not part of that leak . Microsoft released a patch ( MS17-010 ) for the vulnerability in March 2017 for supported versions of Windows , and the toolset was leaked publicly by the group in April , supposedly in response to Trump 's action in Syria . <p> It is n't publicly known whether Microsoft got lucky in releasing the patch in March , or whether they were given advanced warning , but due to the way enterprises update their systems , there can be a time lag until such security updates are applied to all machines . As a result , a single , compromised machine on a network could lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take is one individual to open a malicious attachment or click on a malicious link . <p> The message from Wana Decrypt0r received by victims of the hack . Photo : Wikimedia <p> It is also worth noting this attack could have been considerably worse . <p> A UK-based security researcher , going by the pseudonym MalwareTech , discovered the malware had what is called a ' kill-switch ' , which in this case meant the virus would stop spreading if a particular website existed . <p> Indeed , we 're lucky the people who made the ransomware did n't disable that feature . The researcher in question discovered the website had not been registered and duly registered it himself , potentially preventing a much wider spread of the malware . <p> But quite why the malware developers included the kill-switch is still a mystery . <p> Q : Are hacks like this preventable ? Many of us have had to update a security patch on a computer , but can they prevent something like this ? <p> A : Writing code that aims to be bug-free is very expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyday software . A good example of cutting-edge development is the open source seL4 microkernel , developed by Data61 . <p> seL4 contains about 10,000 lines of C code and has some of the strongest guarantees obtainable that it is free of security vulnerabilities . <p> Microsoft Windows , on the other hand , is thousands of times larger than seL4 -- with some estimating its size at around 50 million lines of code . Trying to achieve the same guarantees of bug freedom for Windows is simply too large . <p> That said , such attacks can be mitigated against , but can not be prevented entirely . <p> It is essential that organisations have strength in depth . Thorough and well-tested backup procedures are a first step . Regular updates to operating systems are equally essential . Above all else , organisations require skilled IT security staff to protect their networks and systems . <p> Applying good security practices is the responsibility of everyone within the organisation , with the example starting from the top down . Poorly conceived practices can make matters worse and give us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know who 's behind the attack and why they did it ? Is the aim a purely financial one or is it more about disruption ? <p> A : At the moment we just do n't know . The global impact of the attack indicates the primary objective is the extraction of money from victims . Current reports indicate the amount of money obtained has been relatively limited , however , that amount is likely to increase as more organisations continue their working week and have to deal with any infections . <p> Q : There was a lot of discussion after last year 's US Presidential election about the hacking of the Democrats ' database -- this is a very specific target -- but this attack seems more random ? <p> A : There is currently no evidence to suggest this was particularly targeted , or that the primary objective of this attack was data extraction , as in the case of the attack on the Democrats . <p> However , as is often the case , the malware combines multiple compromises . In addition to the ransomware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This leaves an infected machine open to further attack and potential compromise of data . As such , the nature of the attack could change and we could see further consequences if machines containing sensitive data were compromised . It is too early to say whether any secondary attacks were launched to extract personal data , particularly in the case of the National Health Service ( NHS ) in the United Kingdom . <p> If they were , this would not be obvious . Nor would installing the patch solve the problem if the machine was already infected . <p> Q : The attack on the NHS saw emergency rooms shut and operations cancelled . Are we likely to see more incidents like this targetting large infrastructure ? <p> A : It is not clear the NHS was specifically targeted , it is more likely the IT systems in the NHS were poorly protected and outdated , as a result of critical under-funding . As such , they were more susceptible to the attack . In particular , large parts of the NHS are still using Windows XP which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers would have been particularly susceptible to the worm , and hence one compromised individual would have compromised every Windows XP on the network -- which in the case of the NHS could have been many machines . <p> Microsoft has now released a patch for Windows XP as well , even though it is officially out of support . Running mission critical services on no longer supported operating systems is a recipe for disaster . If the NHS was not able to update to a supported version of Windows it should have considered switching to an open source alternative like Linux . <p> Q : Can these attacks be stopped and will it have any long-term impact on how we operate and protect ourselves online ? <p> A : Malware typically exploits bugs and mistakes in software . We are n't likely to see the eradication of all software bugs , so we should expect these types of attacks to keep happening . But developing an understanding of the risks and the mitigation strategies , along with deploying good security practices , is our best defence . <p> IT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience . It is debatable whether our governments or businesses are adequately resourced to understand the threats or deploy the mitigating strategies . How many chief technology officers have the sufficient training to understand IT security ? <p> If boards and governments see IT security as an inconvenience and a cost , rather than as an enabler for them to continue functioning in the face of a malicious onslaught , we will continue to see under-investment and attacks like this one having significant impact . <p> Q : Will this change the way we use networks and the internet in the future ? <p> A : For anyone with an IT security background what has occurred is of no great surprise . <p> This should be a wake-up call to government and business to take IT security more seriously . As for whether it will change the way in which we do things , it is probably quite unlikely . This is n't the first attack like this , and it wo n't be the last . <p> Such attacks should be expected and plans should be made and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adequate recovery plan can not be formulated , then the system in question should not be online , and should have physical protection to try and mitigate against possible attacks . <p> However , such measures come at the cost of greater inconvenience to the end-user , and require widespread organisational change . It is perfectly possible to do , many high-security organisations will run separate networks to protect against attacks like this , but to do so requires buy-in from management and staff . <p> The question is whether organisations have sufficient willpower and understanding of the risks to make the right changes . <p> Firstly , there 's a government failure to fund public sector IT sufficiently for basic safety . The UK 's NHS should never have been running critical services on machines that were too old to get security patches . This will continue to be a problem for as long as the true cost of skimping on cybersecurity is not understood <p> Secondly , there 's the failure of the public and private sectors to install a patch that was deployed ( for modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there 's the failure of Microsoft to produce secure software . <p> And finally , there 's the controversial issue that the exploit at the heart of this attack was discovered by NSA and used in its own toolkit for gaining unauthorised access to machines . The existence of the vulnerability was only disclosed when the NSA toolkit was stolen earlier this year . This represents a dangerous gamble : the assumption that an unpatched security hole will be exploited only by law enforcement agencies and spies on your own side . <p> Microsoft 's president has now likened this attack to " the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen " and has called for a Digital Geneva Convention , to address nation states exploiting and hoarding known vulnerabilities . <p> A well-secured fortress has multiple layers of security so that if one fails the others will defend the city .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Putting the " E " into e-consumer protection <p> We can shop and be entertained wherever and whenever we like , but consumer protections have n't kept pace with e-commerce technology . New technologies now have the potential to be the consumer 's best safeguard <p> By Associate Professor Jeannie Paterson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Online digital technology is a bonanza for consumer choice and new-business profits , but consumer protection has been left behind . <p> But the good news is legal minds are now starting to use technology to hit back . <p> The large number of goods and services now available online increases the need for consumer protection . Picture : Pixabay <p> The internet has opened up a wealth of new shopping experiences , from browsing virtual stores at your fingers tips to downloading or streaming music , videos and games . Like never before consumers have greater choice about where and what they buy , and how and when they engage with entertainment . <p> But what can you do when a trader in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or delivers a bad product ? And what are the dangers of never reading the terms and conditions of online services because they , literally , take the best part of a day just to read them ? <p> These longstanding conundrums of consumer protection are becoming much more significant now that goods and services are increasingly being accessed online . The challenge now is to use technology to better guarantee consumer rights , and it is already happening from chatbots dispensing legal advice to artificial intelligence applications that can scan and advise on legal contracts . <p> Regulators are increasingly using new technology to improve business compliance . So-called regtech usually refers to the use of technology and big data to progress regulatory monitoring and compliance objectives in the finance industry . But this type of synergy between online technology , big data and artificial intelligence has the potential to transform other regulatory fields , including consumer protection . It could even be developed to directly help consumers . <p> In the UK , university student Joshua Bowder developed the DoNotPay chatbot , which is a computer-guided conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge parking fines , but has been extended to advice on various consumer rights issues . Most recently it has been extended to provide advice on the rights of the homeless and asylum seekers . <p> These kinds of chatbots could be readily used to help resolve simple disputes between consumers and e-commerce traders . <p> Big online e-commerce providers like eBay and PayPal are already providing online dispute resolutions systems , and jurisdictions like the European Union and Canada 's British Columbia are developing their own dispute resolution platforms . These involved guide steps for parties to resolve their disputes by either interacting with each other or paying for a mediator . <p> Melbourne university students , in their Law Apps subject , are using application technology to design build and release live legal expert apps that for the not-for-profit sector that guide non-lawyers through complex legal systems , like environmental planning or bankruptcy law . <p> So what 's in store for the consumer of the future in terms of ease and security ? <p> Consumers face increasingly complicated packages for the delivery of online services . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and games you are often not actually making a purchase in the traditional sense , but rather entering a licence for a bundle of digital rights . <p> The contracts governing those licencing rights and obligations are similarly complex . Consumer watchdog Choice recently raised concerns over the unreasonably long length of online contracts . Notably , Choice found that Amazon Kindle 's terms and conditions take nearly nine hours to read . Many of those terms are aimed at providing extensive protection for the rights of the supplier , and excluding any possible liability on its part . <p> It is ironic that given the ready availability of digital tools to promote high design standards , the online contracts being presented by the large digital providers are almost uniformly poorly designed and ungainly in appearance . Contracts are often displayed in PDF format and are commonly written in capitals that are difficult to read . It should be a regulatory requirement on businesses to present contracts in a way that makes them easy to navigate and read , while also providing accessible definitions and explanations . Looking forward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting opportunity to help consumers help themselves . <p> AI is already being used effectively in legal practice to automate some tasks and improve the efficiency of others , such as through document protection and document management , as well as discovery for litigation . But it could go further . AI could become a participant in the contracting process . Some legal business start-ups for example are developing AI technology to help advise clients on business contracts . <p> From a consumer perspective , these types of advances could be made widely available online and used to identify contracting risks , assess the reliability and reputation of providers and source alternative products on fairer terms . <p> What these developments tell us is that the potential of new technology is not limited to promoting business interests and consumer choice . With the right support , and some imagination , new technology can be used to protect the consumers on the other side of the contracting paradigm . <p> To mark Law Week ( 15 -- 21 May 2017 ) , Pursuit is looking at some of the issues facing @ University 's Privacy Officer at **30;330;TOOLONG 
 <h> Five things about ... Poo <p> Claudia Hooper Hi , I 'm Claudia Hooper -- production assistant on Eavesdrop on Experts . You 're about to listen to a sneaky , bonus offering of Eavesdrop . This week , we bring you a special episode called 5 Things About Poo . Yep , Poo . So , I guess it 's less about Eavesdrop on Experts and more Eavesdrop on well , excrement . I 'll let Chris talk you through it . <p> Chris Hatzis Welcome to Five Things About . I 'm Chris Hatzis . Five Things About is for you and your inner curious cat , the part of you that just loves to know what others know about inventions and ideas . In each episode , we 'll meet experts who 'll share five insights from their field of work . You 've heard the proverb curiosity killed the cat . The rest of the proverb is but satisfaction brought it back . So go on , knock yourself out and bring yourself back . <p> Today we explore five things about poo . Yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faeces . It 's something we do n't talk about openly . It can cause shame and embarrassment , but our toilet habits reveal a lot about our emotions , attitudes , culture and gender . It 's also a serious issue . Faecal borne diseases are a major cause of death in many places around the world . <p> Our host today is Claire Darling , podcasting intern at the University of Melbourne . We 're talking to Professor Nick Haslam from the University of Melbourne 's Department of Psychological Sciences . <p> Nick Haslam Universally , excrement is the main taboo term across , pretty much , all languages . <p> Chris Hatzis Nick is the author of Psychology in the Bathroom . It 's a great read about the sociology of poo . We 'll also hear from Naomi Francis , a PhD candidate at the Nossal Institute . <p> Naomi Francis We have toilet graveyards around the world . <p> Chris Hatzis Naomi 's investigating the link between poor water sanitation and hygiene in Timor-Leste . As part of her research , she asks people where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's well practised in having awkward conversations . <p> Claire Darling Hi Nick . Preparing for this episode sparked a very candid conversation about poo amongst my colleagues . In particular , we talked about that time around 11 AM , when our caffeinated mornings find us all migrating to the office toilets . Each of us had different feelings about how we approach pooing in a shared toilet . It 's an embarrassing event for many of us . Nick , why are some people so fearful about going to the toilet in public ? <p> Nick Haslam Well , I think it 's a very private act , and it 's something which strong emotions are attached to . For instance , people often feel disgusted about the process . You 're taught from an early age that your poo is something to be gotten rid of and forgotten about and flushed away . There 's a lot of shame to do with it . You 're exposing your body in a way you would n't do in public . <p> I think also , especially for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean , proper and , in the words of one study participant on a study on this topic , women are meant to be non-poopers . It 's something which somehow goes against femininity , if you like . Not to say that there 's lots of anxieties about going to the bathroom for both men and women . There 's enormous anxiety to do with it , partly , as I said , exposure , partly the fact that there 's a lot of disgust and shame attached to this very human practice everywhere . <p> Claire Darling So how is this taboo around human poo - how has that developed over time ? Is it as big an issue now as it was , say , 100 , 200 years ago ? <p> Nick Haslam I think it 's always been an issue , and it 's an issue for a very good reason . I mean a huge number of children die each year because of faecally transmitted infections . There are very good reasons to get rid of your excrement . It is a primal contaminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean there 's a wonderful survey done of the British public a while ago , which were - they were asked to say which are the most important inventions of all time , and number nine was the flush toilet , right above the combustion engine . People get it . People get how it is important to be rid of this stuff . <p> Now , that 's not to say it 's an instinct . So people often imagine that there must be some sort of instinctive aversion to excrement , but you only have to look at very small children to realise there 's no instinct . They 'll smear things . They do all sorts of horrible things . <p> My favourite study of this was done with two year olds by the American psychologist Paul Rosen . What he did was he constructed a fake poo out of peanut butter and smelly blue cheese , put it on crackers and offered it to two year olds , and almost all of them took it and ate it , even when told what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So there 's no instinct of aversion . You have to learn it . But once you 've learned it , I think , even as an adult , there 's this taboo attached to it ; not necessarily one which inspires horror , but that anxiety , and the fact that we make humour of this is partly a way of acknowledging that there 's some sort of taboo charge attached to it . <p> Claire Darling Diarrhoea caused by dirty water and bad sanitation is the second biggest killer of children worldwide . PhD candidate , Naomi Francis , has been working with WaterAid to improve access to safe water , sanitation and hygiene in Timor-Leste . <p> Naomi Francis The biggest problem we 're worried about with poo and containing it is diarrhoea . Lots of diarrhoea is caused by stuff found in poo . Our poo has lots of pathogens in it , and they come in several formats . One is viruses , and they 're a small infectious agent that replicates inside the living cells of other organisms . So that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single celled micro-organisms . Protozoa , another one , another kind of single cell micro-organism . And then there 's helminths , which are parasitic worms . Those are the four main players involved in causing disease in our poo . <p> Claire Darling WaterAid states that three in 10 people in Timor-Leste lack safe water , and twice as many have nowhere to go to the toilet but out in the open . Can you tell us more about the situation there ? <p> Naomi Francis The biggest issue is what we call open defecation , which is a fancy word for shitting in the bush basically . That could be in rivers , usually in a private spot , in the forest . Sometimes it 's in the ocean . It does n't just refer to going and finding a random spot . Open defecation includes unsafe forms of sanitation , so someone may have built a specific structure or place for going to the toilet , but if it 's not safely containing faeces , then it 's considered open defecation . <p> In these remote communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsafe sources , so open sources like springs or rivers or creeks . Those are fine as long as they 're protected and you can be sure that they 're not being contaminated by what 's going on upstream , and that might be open defecation or animals or industry . So a lot of these communities are n't accessing safe water . <p> In terms of their sanitation practices most of the community will be defecating in the open , and in terms of hygiene , because of a lack of convenient water sources , so they 're having to carry their water . They 're not washing their hands as frequently as they should . There 's less than safe levels of menstrual hygiene management . The main things that are going on is that people do n't have access to safe water or a safe way to deal with their faeces . <p> Claire Darling So how do community led programs address these issues ? <p> Naomi Francis This technique that WaterAid are using is - it 's really tapping into - or it 's trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shame around faeces to trigger them into changing their behaviour . <p> The way it 's done in the villages that I saw in Timor-Leste were there 's a community meeting that 's held , and the community are asked to draw - or make a community map out of coloured sand on the ground . On that map , various people are asked to mark out where they defecated that day . It 's meant to be a little bit embarrassing , but it 's meant to be funny , and usually it is . In all the contexts that I saw people were a bit uncomfortable , but there was lots of laughing and fooling around with it as well . <p> Then a second part of the activity is to actually go for a walk out in to the community to find places where people have defecated . The facilitator will take a stick with them . They 'll find a piece of poo , put the stick in it , bring it back to the group , they 'll get one of their hairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put that in a glass of water . This is all to symbolise that a hair is as big as the legs of a fly , and it 's just to show the faecal oral pathway via that fly route . <p> Then they 'll offer the glass of water around to people in the group and , obviously , no-one will drink it . But they 're really trying to bring home to people what the faecal oral pathway is and what 's going on when they shit in the bush and do n't cover it up . <p> Claire Darling Nick , how is the language and the way we talk about poo related to the psychological responses that we have ? <p> Nick Haslam Universally , excrement is the main taboo term across , pretty much , all languages . It 's also the most common thing that people with Tourette 's Syndrome blurt out : faecal words like shit . That sort of shows it 's the - really seen as the most offensive thing to say because people who lose those inhibitions express it those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the word shit in swearing . You know this makes sense . The taboo words we use to express strong emotions are the ones attached to the most primal taboo subjects , usually sex , excrement and god . So although these excrement related words are universally taboo and widespread across almost all languages , they 're more used in some languages than others . <p> There 's been cross-cultural studies on swearing , on how people respond to someone who 's violated some social rule . Especially Germans and Americans , it 's been shown , tend to use more anally themed swearing . So it 's more in some cultures than others - maybe the more Anglo Saxon ones - but , nevertheless , it 's fairly universal as a theme , as a taboo theme , because it 's a taboo issue for all human beings . <p> Claire Darling Can you tell us more about the role gender plays in going to the bathroom ? <p> Nick Haslam Sure . It 's one of the areas where I think we often forget that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the sexual double standard , but I think there 's also an excretory double standard . I think women are held to much higher standards of odourlessness , soundlessness . Women tend to be more bothered about using public rest rooms . At least the studies show that . <p> One terrific study showed that women are really penalised socially if they are seen as going to the bathroom . An experiment : either male or female , left the room in the study and told the participant in the study that they were going in one condition to the bathroom , and the other condition just to get some papers . <p> Then the impressions of the participant of the experimenter were observed . The woman who said she was going off the bathroom was judged more negatively than the one who 'd just gone to get some papers , but there was no excretion penalty for the male experimenter . There 's something incompatible between femininity and excretion , I think , in the popular mind . <p> Women are also more , on average , censorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find some of these things , on average , more offensive . So gender plays a big role here . I think , in part , that 's because men play up their grossness as a reaction against femininity because femininity is associated with being proper , with being clean , with being neat . One way to display raucous masculinity is to do the opposite . <p> Claire Darling According to Naomi Francis females have added challenges in low income settings like Timor-Leste . <p> Naomi Francis The specific gender needs of people using toilets are the same all over the world . For women their specific needs are around menstrual hygiene management and around pregnancy . When you 're thinking about getting people to use toilets you need to take the menstrual hygiene management needs of women into account . That usually includes having a larger space for changing clothes or for washing clothes . That means also having a place where you can have water and drainage in the toilet . <p> In a low income setting that 's particularly important because women are often using rags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the privacy , I guess . That means having a toilet that is specifically for women . It needs to have doors that lock from the inside properly . Programs these days that deal with menstrual hygiene management also look at the psychosocial elements of it , so the stigma around menstruation . <p> Nick Haslam Well , my take on this is that he was actually right about describing a kind of person . Freud said there was this - what he called the anal triad of personality traits that tend to go together . They were orderliness , being perfectionistic , requiring things to be just so and rigid . There was obstinacy , being stubborn and irascible . And there was parsimony , which is basically being tight with money or concerned about not wasting things , not wasting time . <p> It turns out that those things do , in fact , go together . Those characteristics are a part of the recognised type of person . The trouble is Freud thought that these things stemmed from toilet training practices , that there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as children , taking pleasure in retaining their faeces . There 's absolutely no evidence for that . <p> So Freud was right in describing a kind of personality . It 's real , and it 's actually still in the diagnostic manual of psychiatry to this day . It 's called obsessive compulsive personality disorder . It completely precisely matches Freud 's description of the anal character , but it 's got nothing to do with the anus . <p> Claire Darling Naomi , can you tell us about toilet graveyards and how your community led program may offer a different solution ? <p> Naomi Francis You can go all over the world in low income settings and see toilet graveyards everywhere because NGOs and governments that have thought what we need to do is build toilets because they do n't have the money to build them , whereas , actually , it 's a much more - I guess a psychologically based reason for not using them . <p> What we 've found since is that people did n't actually end up using the toilets , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there 's these beautifully constructed toilets that are n't being used anymore , or they 're being used for anything but defecation . So I 've seen people cooking in their toilets because you 've got this nice concrete basin that you can put a fire in . <p> Some toilets you would often find full of faeces , but it would be cow dung which is being dried out because that will be the driest place in the village . People are definitely using them for interesting things , but not what they 're intended for . <p> My research is looking at what that event changes basically . I measured sanitation indicators before that triggering meeting . What I found was that a lot of people had started building their toilets or had made active plans to build a toilet . They were starting to get materials , that kind of thing , in that one week after . Six to nine months later there was a bit of a spread . Some people still had not started building toilets . Some of them had built toilets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people had built and maintained and were improving their toilets . They were adding concrete to it or they were adding - what they call ' ' , which is a little concrete tank next to the toilet for washing themselves afterwards . There were all levels of responses at that long-term follow-up . <p> Claire Darling Nick , tell us what measures do some people take to conceal their toilet habits ? <p> Nick Haslam We 're talking about anxieties about using bathrooms . This , I think , has got a long history . There 's a terrific anecdote , a sad anecdote , from the early 20th century of two sisters who worked in a mill and had to walk past a particular window where they could be observed by male workmates every time they had to go to the loo . <p> They found that so unpleasant that they ended up not going , and ended up only being able to go on weekends , both of them , and having to spend most of Sunday evacuating their bowels because they developed this inhibition about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of concern about being observed is really widespread . <p> Apparently , in Japan you can buy machines that make white noise so that you can disguise your sounds . They 're very widely used , especially by Japanese women , I gather . This is something where people do n't like being exposed . Even if they 're in private , they would rather have this illusion that no-one else is around . <p> Claire Darling What would be a course of action to improve upon that person 's phobia ? <p> Nick Haslam It 's easy to make light of this subject , but it actually could be quite serious . Some of these problems can be quite debilitating . Look , I think the thing to do is to get in touch with a psychologist who specialises in anxiety . They 'll do a program of treatment which gradually helps you to feel less anxious , more relaxed , less threatened , and guide you through a process of learning to have fewer inhibitions in this kind of area . <p> Chris Hatzis That 's five things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than five .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Picturing the Credit Crunch <p> A new model provides unique insight into how the global financial crisis unfolded , in the hope of preventing a repeat <p> By Tamara Heath , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> The spread of the global financial crisis ( GFC ) from one country to another over days , weeks and months can now unfold before your eyes thanks to a ground-breaking network model . <p> The model , which tracks how the financial crisis moved and proliferated like a virus through the governments and banks of 18 countries between 2006 and 2015 , has been developed by a research team at the University of Melbourne 's Faculty of Business and Economics . <p> Dr Matthew , who developed the model with the Melbourne Institute 's Dr Viet Nguyen and PhD student Huang , says this is the first time such a detailed network model has been developed . <p> A representation showing the strongest links in the global system in 2011 when Portugal requested financial help . Picture : Supplied <p> The model 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starting two years before the catastrophic collapse of Lehman Brothers -- once the United States ' fourth largest investment bank -- and ending as the Greek government missed its deadline to repay a multimillion dollar debt to the International Monetary Fund . <p> Supported by a 2015 Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Research Award , the model forms the core of Dr 's ambitious research into the transmission of shocks in the global economy . <p> " Many of the existing network models consider only risk transmission between banks or between sovereigns , not both , " he says . <p> " Small , tightly focused models are great for studying specific aspects of a crisis but you need to build global models to get the big picture . <p> " By focusing on a single country and the events that led to the crisis in that country , you may miss the links to other countries and their institutions . <p> " Our model has much broader coverage than most . We set out from the beginning to build a sophisticated global model to capture the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK , Ireland , Portugal , Italy and Germany -- as well as Scandinavia , the US , China , Japan , Russia and Australia . " <p> Dr says he hopes the model will provide politicians and regulators with a deeper understanding of how crises spread , ensuring they are better prepared in future to break the chain of events caused by bank failures or the collapse of asset market bubbles . <p> " A lot of economic policy evolves in response to the last crisis rather than in anticipation of the next . For example , after the risks posed by real estate bubbles became evident , a number of countries implemented policies to prevent excessive growth in mortgage debt , such as capping loan-to-value ratios , " he says . <p> " But banks profit by driving innovation and so when regulation erodes profits in one part of their business , they will develop products to target new profit opportunities . As a result , the next crisis is likely to be caused by a different set of factors . <p> " The challenge is identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulators can prioritise their efforts . " <p> Dr says the model also identifies links between countries , for example Australia 's dependence on the economic and financial conditions in China . <p> " If there was an economic crisis in Russia , we probably would n't need to be too worried about the impact on our economy , " he says . <p> " However , if that same crisis occurred in China it would be a different story . " <p> Dr says Australian prosperity depends on China , and changes in the Chinese economic and financial landscape would have significant implications . <p> A snapshot of Australia 's links within the world economy as of mid-2015 . Picture : Supplied <p> The increasing private ownership of banks in China , where state-ownership has traditionally been the norm , is one such change already under way . <p> " The credit risk of Chinese state-owned banks has typically been low because they are backed by the government , " he says . <p> " As private ownership grows , Australian businesses may need to accommodate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future . " <p> The model was created using nine years of daily data on bank and sovereign credit default swaps , akin to insurance contracts which protect investors against losses in the event that a bank or a government defaults on its debts . <p> Soon to be publicly available , users will be able to access high resolution network graphics showing the key linkages in the global financial system and how they change over time . <p> The results can be filtered by date and country to provide a personalised experience . <p> " We hope that by providing an easy-to-use interface which does n't require any formal training in economics and finance , anyone who is interested in our model will be able to explore its results and look into the issues that are specifically relevant to them , " Dr says . <p> " We 'd really like to see students engaging with our research because understanding historical crises and attempting to prevent future crises is one of the defining challenges University 's Privacy Officer at **30;1049;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> Why South Korea 's fresh start is good news for Australian business <p> After months of political scandal that saw South Korea 's former president impeached , a newly elected leader could mean big opportunities for Australia <p> By Mukund Narayanamurti , CEO Asialink Business , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> As headline writers busied themselves with the federal budget , Prime Minister Turnbull 's visit to the US , and the election of France 's new President , an international development of critical importance to Australia went largely unnoticed . <p> South Korea , Australia 's fourth largest trading partner , went to the polls on 9 May . Triggered by the impeachment in March of the incumbent President Park Geun-hye , over her alleged role in a scandal linked to South Korea 's powerful family firms -- known as chaebols -- the stakes were high . <p> In the 1970s and 1980s , the South Korean government channelled capital into these chaebols , which also held extended trade preferences and monopoly rights over many key industries .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Can the NDIS deliver ? <p> As the signature National Disability Insurance Scheme rolls out nationally , a research project questions its ability to address systemic inequality <p> By Associate Professor Helen Dickinson , University of Melbourne/University of New South Wales Canberra <p> Share selection to : <p> The National Disability Insurance Scheme ( NDIS ) is the most significant reform of disability services in Australia in a generation . The scheme , introduced in 2013 , aims to increase both the funding available for disability services and the control that people living with disabilities have over the design and delivery of their care . <p> It does this , in part , by handing greater control over care budgets to people with disabilities and their families so that services might be designed and delivered in a way that better meets their individual needs . <p> Recently , Australia was ranked last in an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) study of quality of life of people with disabilities , and with the significantly worse outcomes experienced by people with disabilities , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to improve services for people with disabilities and make them more accessible . Picture : Pixabay <p> We recently embarked on a research project , funded by the University of Melbourne 's Social Equity Institute , to explore the degree to which the NDIS is achieving its aims and objectives from the perspective of people with disability using these services . <p> We found that , despite aspirations to reform Australian disability services and to give greater choice and control to individuals with disabilities , the system is not yet operating in the way that is intended . It may even be exacerbating some of the inequities it was designed to solve . <h> EXPECTATIONS vs REALITY <p> We took a novel approach to the research process , which is participatory in nature , involving community researchers with disabilities working with University-based experts . Involving people with disabilities in the research process improved the quality of the project in terms of our ability to collect and analyse evidence effectively . <p> Together we collected data from people with disabilities and parents or adult children caring for people with disabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victorian trial site of Barwon . It is difficult to be definitive about people 's experience under the NDIS and whether this initiative has succeeded in delivering on its aims . Participants ' expectations and experiences of the NDIS appeared to be strongly influenced by their circumstances . <p> Parents of young children tended to have high expectations and be strongly motivated to obtain comprehensive packages of services and support . Parents of adult children were more likely to note little difference in levels of support for their children since transitioning to the NDIS , but significant increases in administrative requirements and hurdles . <p> Those living with cognitive disabilities tended to report few changes in their everyday situations , while people living with physical disabilities had a range of views , from positive changes associated with increased independence to deep frustration with ongoing struggles to gain access to crucial resources . <p> Parents of young children with disabilities tend to be highly motivated to navigate the system on behalf of their child . Picture : Pixabay <p> The data we collected for our report provides insights into the perceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-section of people currently navigating the NDIS system . These include : <p> gratitude for increased funding to access services and resources and reduced waiting lists for services <p> frustration about inconsistent access to services , information and resources to be able to exercise choice and control over their care <p> disappointment that their knowledge , experience , needs and preferences are being overlooked in planning processes and in the design of the scheme <p> concern that boundaries between services they want to combine remain pronounced <p> doubt about the capacity of the scheme 's workforce , systems and budget to meet their needs <p> suggestions to simplify administrative systems , promote consistency in decision-making when allocating resources , and clarify the aims and objectives of the scheme . <p> However , of greater importance than some of these proposed operational changes , are issues of equity . Improving care planning processes or working more effectively across administrative boundaries will not help guard against the NDIS exacerbating the traditional inequalities that it was , at least in part , designed to help alleviate . <p> Although there is the assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional inequities in relation to socio-economic position , residential location , level of education and household income , amongst others , the reality is that we have yet to see this emerge and in some cases it seemed to us that the NDIS might exacerbate these inequities . <p> For example , if you live in a rural or remote area there are typically fewer providers available so you do n't have the same range of choices you might have in a metropolitan area . If you live in a rural area and choose to purchase services from a metropolitan area , the time it takes for the professional to travel to you is counted as time in receipt of that service meaning that you might get less time with that professional . <p> But it is not just the availability of services that poses challenges in terms of equities . Our research found that those who are better able , either through their own ability or support from family , friends and others , to understand and navigate these systems fare better overall . Those who are more isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are less well placed to make demands in terms of services and care planning processes . <p> So although the aspiration to reform Australian disability services is a noble one , the system is not yet providing the choice and control it promised to individuals with disabilities . <p> As the NDIS is now being rolled out nationally , processes need to be put in place to ensure it fulfils its aspiration of supporting a better life for hundreds and thousands of Australians with disabilities . <p> This research was funded by the University of Melbourne 's Melbourne Social Equity Institute .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Making space for emergency talk <p> In hectic hospital emergency rooms communication is critical but often difficult . Part of the answer is cleverly designed spaces for staff to talk in that can help reduce mistakes and stress loads <p> By Dr Lucio Naccarella , University of Melbourne , and Associate Professor Bernice Redley , Deakin University <p> Share selection to : <p> Hospital emergency departments are high-pressure environments where the stakes are high -- often life or death . These spaces have historically and overwhelmingly been designed to fast-track patients through to treatment areas . <p> But where do nurses or doctors go to consult privately or debrief amid the stress ? <p> They ca n't go to the cafeteria , it is too far away , and they ca n't disappear into offices because their work demands that they be able to see and be seen in order to respond quickly to fast-moving events . Instead critical conversations about patient care and staff welfare are being hurriedly whispered in corridors or behind partially drawn curtains , or even inside crowded storerooms . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately , mistakes . Previous research suggests that miscommunication between hospital staff is the root cause of up to a staggering 80 per cent of medical errors . <p> Emergency department staff are often forced to communicate " on the fly " in inappropriate spaces like corridors . This can lead to miscommunication and breaches of confidentiality . Picture : Shutterstock <p> Our new Emergency , which included a survey of over 100 emergency care workers and follow up interviews with 39 of them , examined the influence of these workspaces on the vital informal staff communication that goes on in emergency departments . It reveals that staff are having to make some difficult trade-offs to accommodate their work practices and their need for privacy ; whether that 's to discuss a patient or provide comfort to each other . <p> " A lot of communication is on the fly . When you are in the corridor , that 's the opportunity to talk to your buddy or a senior nurse going past , " one emergency nurse told us . <p> Others explained how difficult it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one staffer reported " there is no privacy with a curtain , as much as you think there is . A few patients have commented on what we 've said . They know everything that goes on . " <p> Our study suggests we need to provide staff with safe and confidential spaces to communicate effectively that do n't compromise their connection to patients and other staff . But , realistically , there just is n't the space available in our already over-burdened emergency rooms . <p> The solution then is new types of small , adaptable and protected workspaces that staff can use for a variety of activities , including informal communication . It means greater use of multifunction glassed-in areas and low-height partitions where staff can find some temporary privacy amid the bustle around them . <p> High visibility , highly connected large open spaces such as nurses ' stations , staff hubs , and specialist care areas are ideal for staff safety and are the most likely places to be used for formal and informal talk about patients . But these spaces are often not suitable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that staff are resorting to going into storerooms and medication rooms to have private chats . " They are sealed up places ... because sometimes these are just kind of vents ... that 's where you can go ( and ) just hide between compactors . " <p> Corridors are also used frequently for informal communication , but are often not sufficiently private or considered safe by staff . Spaces far from patient areas such as the tearoom or cafeteria are inconvenient for impromptu discussions , but ideal for more general social interaction . <p> Staff often compromise their own physical comfort ( such as not sitting down ) in order to satisfy other more functional needs such as maintaining high visibility and staff numbers on the floor . " It is nice to sit and take a breath ... there are steps in the medication room ... instead of writing on the benches you can sit on the step in the medication room . " <p> Surprisingly we also found that staff did n't support some of the current design trends toward " " hospitals by making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an approach may have merits in other parts of a hospital , emergency staff told us that the high-pressure environment of emergency departments demanded a hierarchical environment that afforded a level of control over patients and barriers that allow staff to exclude patients when necessary . <p> In their frenetic workplace , staff seek glass barriers , doors , curtains and alcoves to provide a measure of safety and separation , but are aware that these also effectively cuts them off from their patients . The task then is to find the right balance . <p> Small , multi-purpose spaces dedicated to non-patient activity are ideal and required for informal communication between staff . But such dedicated spaces are unlikely to be allocated in emergency departments because of tight space constraints , and if they are they can become cluttered with equipment . Instead designers need to focus on providing small , easily adaptable spaces that keep staff visually connected and acoustically separated , and can be used for a variety of activities . <h> Design solutions <p> Small , glazed spaces : These can provide visual connection to patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By being small they are less likely to be used as adhoc storage spaces . <p> Sit and go booths : Small booths with chairs and a small table invite short but comfortable informal meetings . A low-height partition can protect occupants from interruption but still keep them connected to what is around them . <p> If we want to reduce mistakes and stress loads on hospital staff , then re-examining the design of our emergency departments is a good place to start . We need spaces that enhance staff perceptions of safety , control and visual connectedness , while at the same time addressing the aesthetics and physical comforts that improve the experiences of both workers and patients . <p> Emergency Talks was funded by international design practice HASSELL and an Australian Department of Industry Research Connections grant in a collaboration with the University of Melbourne 's Centre for Health Policy , and Deakin University 's Centre for Quality and Patient Safety , and Monash Health . <p> Acknowledgement : Michaela Sheahan from HASSELL contributed to University 's Privacy Officer at **30;28;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> The algorithm for accessing child care <p> How matching theory , the study of supply and demand , could help secure your child a spot in child care <p> By David Delacretaz , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Child care is a major point of anxiety for many new parents . The chronic shortage of spots in major Australian cities , coupled with lengthy waiting lists , places enormous pressure on parents trying to access the essential service . <p> This competitive environment often results in parents applying to multiple centres in the hope of getting at least one offer -- and if they 're lucky they might receive one . <p> Matching theory has been used to assign school places in the U.S. and the U.K. Picture : Pixabay <p> But what if that centre is n't the right choice for their child ? <p> A recent report by the Productivity Commission shows many Australian parents will accept the first place that becomes available for fear of not getting a place at all . <p> But the Centre for Market Design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a far easier solution to this onerous application process -- and one that would benefit both parents and child care service providers . <h> Matching markets <p> Price plays a key role in economics - supply and demand are the driving forces . But not all markets should or do operate this way . In much the same way as you would find a job or a romantic partner , ' matching markets ' are a two-way street ; both parties need to agree . Matching theory , the study of these markets , has become an important field in economics and has many uses . <p> For example , over the past two decades economists have helped assign medical graduates to hospitals , kidney donors to recipients and military cadets to branches of the American army . <p> The CMD is currently working with the Victorian and Commonwealth governments to design several matching markets . One has already proved successful : matching graduates to positions within government departments . The two-way transaction sees both the employees and employers set their preferences , resulting in a quality match which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical hiring process . <h> Mission impossible : securing a spot at child care <p> Matching theory has been used successfully in the United States and the United Kingdom to assign children to schools . Students rank schools in order of preference and are ranked by schools in order of priority , based on administrative criteria such as how far from the school each student lives or whether they have a sibling attending that school .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Disadvantage , family breakdown and homelessness <p> As disadvantaged Australians face rising housing costs , University of Melbourne research looks at the statistics that make the link between family breakdown and homelessness <p> By Dr Julie Moschion , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Australia is going through a well-documented housing affordability crisis and single parents are especially vulnerable to rising housing costs , relying on one income to provide a decent home for their family . <p> Past research has found that " in 2013-14 , 46 per cent of ... low-income couple families and 67 per cent of one-parent families with dependent children in private rental housing paid more than 30 per cent of their income on rent " putting them at risk of " housing affordability stress " . <p> Low income families , especially ones that breakdown , are increasingly at risk of homelessness . Picture : Kacie <p> The financial pressure on single-parent households increased again in April when the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill , which freezes or reduces entitlements to a number of family benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rising housing costs and diminishing family benefits are putting low-income Australian families , especially those that breakdown , at risk of intense financial stress and housing insecurity as well as possibly homelessness . <p> So what happens when a low-income family unit breaks down within the context of these pressures ? <h> THE SURVEY : Journeys Home <p> As part of my research , alongside Professor Jan van Ours from the Erasmus University in Rotterdam , we analysed the effect of parental separation on homelessness using a unique survey of 1,700 disadvantaged Australians who were either homeless or at high risk of homelessness . In Journeys Home we found that parental separation does indeed increase the likelihood of becoming homeless . <p> In this study , we used a broad characterisation of homelessness which seeks to identify situations in which families ' housing conditions do not meet standard requirements to qualify as a ' home ' . <p> This is qualitatively similar to the definition used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics where homelessness is defined as sleeping rough or squatting in abandoned buildings , staying with relatives or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park , boarding house , hotel or crisis accommodation . <h> CAN FAMILY BREAKDOWN ACTUALLY LEAD TO HOMELESSNESS ? <p> Parental separation can lead to homelessness in many ways . For example , a separation might necessitate an urgent move , thereby generating a negative financial shock . Without enough savings or networks of family and friends to help cover this unexpected expense , low-income parents may be unable to afford secure and safe housing for their family , eventually leading to homelessness . <p> Family breakdown appears to be an important factor homelessness . Picture : Lanny <p> Even less disadvantaged parents , who may be able to cope financially in the short run ( such as by covering housing costs with their savings for example ) , may be unable to do so in the medium term once those savings have run out , becoming homeless a few years after the separation occurred . Parental separations can also create conflict between parents and children , which may drive children out of their parent 's home and potentially into homelessness in subsequent years . <p> However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available datasets are not well suited to this purpose . Disadvantaged populations that have experienced homelessness are underrepresented in general household surveys ; and datasets which only include people who are currently homeless fail to capture other segments of the disadvantaged population who might be at risk of homelessness . <p> In contrast , Journeys Home is unique in that it covers a broad spectrum of the disadvantaged population , not just those currently homeless . In fact , 75 per cent of respondents were not homeless at the time of the first interview . At the same time , the high frequency of homelessness and parental separation in the sample provides enough occurrences to address the question of a potential causal relationship between the two . <h> understanding homelessness and disadvantage <p> Our research exploits the detailed information in Journeys Home on respondents ' histories to investigate whether their parents ' separation ( if ever ) led to their first experience of homelessness ( if ever ) . <p> We found that parental separation increases the likelihood of becoming homelessness , conditional on observed and unobserved ( family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if parents separate before the child reaches age 12 , boys have a 10-15 percentage point greater chance of becoming homeless by age 30 . In girls , there 's a 15 -20 percentage point greater chance of becoming homeless by age 30 . However , if the parental separation occurs from the age of 12 , the effect only persists for boys , who are at greater risk of becoming homeless . <p> The effects on homelessness are larger when the parents were formally married prior to the separation . <p> Our results constitute a critical first step in understanding how individuals , and in particular children or young adults , become homeless . It highlights the role that parental separation can play in the process of a person becoming homeless , and therefore the pressing need to address the issue of housing affordability for disadvantaged families that breakdown in order to protect children from poverty and homelessness . <p> If you or anyone you know needs help , you can call University 's Privacy Officer at **30;348;TOOLONG 
 <p> The data shows that today 's aggregate warming effect of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , methane ( CH4 ) nitrous oxide ( N2O ) is higher than at any time over the last 800,000 years , according to the ice core records going back that far . <p> Greenhouse gases began with the onset of the industrial era around 1750 . Picture : Pixabay <p> Building on half a century of atmospheric measurements by the international research community , the data was compiled and analysed by a group of international scientists led by Malte Meinshausen , from the University of Melbourne , with colleagues there and at CSIRO . <p> Together , the data provides the most compelling evidence of the unprecedented perturbation of the Earth 's atmosphere . The data clearly shows that the growth of greenhouse gases began with the onset of the industrial era around 1750 , took a sharp turn upwards in the 1950s , and still continues today . <p> This data includes 43 different greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere from dozens of human activities and industrial processes . While CO2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenhouse gases such as dichlorodifluoromethane ( CFC-12 ) are slowly starting to decline as a result of policies to ban their use . <h> The greenhouse gases <p> Most of us know about CO2 , CH4 and N2O as being among the principal causes of human-induced climate change . They are found in the atmosphere in the absence of human activity , but the rise in their concentrations are due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels , deforestation and agriculture ( livestock , rice paddies and the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers ) . They are all from biological or fossil fuel sources . <p> But there is much more when it comes to greenhouse gases . Our analysis features a further 40 greenhouse gases ( among hundreds that exist ) , many of them emitted in very small quantities . Although many might play a small role , dichlorodifluoromethane ( CFC-12 ) and trichlorofluoromethane ( CFC-11 ) are the third and fifth most important greenhouse gas in terms of their overall contribution to global warming . <p> Most of these gases are emitted exclusively by humans , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as aerosol spray propellants , refrigerants , fire-extinguishing agents , and in the production of semiconductors , among other industrial applications . <p> Synthetic greenhouse gases include chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) , hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( HCFCs ) , hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) , perfluorocarbons ( PFCs ) , sulfur hexafluoride ( SF6 ) and others . Several , most famously CFCs , also deplete the ozone layer , and are regulated under the Montreal Protocol . Others , such as HFCs , were actually first produced in large quantities to replace the ozone depleting substances , but unfortunately turned out to be potent greenhouse gases too . <p> Importantly , all 43 greenhouse gases offer opportunities to tackle climate change , either by reducing their emissions or , in the case of synthetic gases , finding non-greenhouse alternatives . <h> Not all greenhouse gases are the same <p> How much a greenhouse gas contributes to warming depends on three factors . <p> First , how much mass of a gas is emitted . Second , how effective any kilogram of gas in the atmosphere is in warming the planet . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The last 2000 years of greenhouse gas concentrations . Picture : Supplied <p> CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas in warming the planet despite , per unit of mass , the fact it 's greenhouse gas with the weakest warming potential . Its contribution to warming comes from the sheer scale of emissions 40 billion tonnes emitted each year , and the fact that a large part effectively hangs around in the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years after emission . The resulting concentration makes CO2 responsible for about 65 per cent of all warming due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities . <p> This makes CO2 the most important factor in determining future global warming . <p> Unless we can cut CO2 emissions to zero by the second half of this century , primarily by finding alternatives to fossil fuels , the world will continue to warm beyond the 2 ? C or the aspirational 1.5 ? C target of the Paris Agreement . <p> Methane ( CH4 ) is the next most important greenhouse gas , with current concentration contributing about 15 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gases have very high global warming potentials . The one with the highest current emissions is the refrigerant HFC-134a , which is 1300 times more potent than CO2 ( per mass unit emitted ) .

Picture : NASA <p> ( CFC-12 ) , a former refrigerant , is both a potent ozone depleting substance and a powerful greenhouse gas . Although its emissions and atmospheric concentrations are now declining thanks to global compliance with the Montreal Protocol , it is still the third most important greenhouse gas and responsible for 6-7 per cent of all warming since the beginning of the industrial era . <h> What is this data good for ? <p> Our new compilation of greenhouse gas data is the most complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate change , and how we humans are altering the Earth 's atmosphere .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> What will the British election mean for Brexit ? <p> The results of the British general election will decide which party sits down with the EU to hammer out a deal <p> By Lucas , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Britain 's next leader will have the difficult task of deciding on concrete outcomes for populist platitudes in relation to Brexit . <p> Voters will go to the polls on June 8 for a general election that will decide which governing party will negotiate Brexit . It comes almost a year after the referendum in which the British people voted to leave the European Union . <p> Since that momentous vote , and since former Prime Minster David Cameron 's subsequent resignation , Theresa May has led the incumbent Conservative government . She called the ( very early ) election saying she needed consensus in parliament to negotiate the best possible terms for exiting the EU . <p> Brexit is a fait accompli . However , since the government triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty in March -- formally beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brexit is also a significant political liability . <p> In light of this , the incumbent government is seeking to expand its fragile 17-seat majority in the House of Commons as political insurance . <h> ' Hard ' or ' soft ' Brexit ? <p> The Conservative government , if re-elected , is positioning for a probable ' hard ' exit . Its Brexit White Paper and the Conservative Party election manifesto both stress exclusive British control on immigration . Holding to this view means Britain can not maintain even a modified membership within the EU because members must guarantee freedom of movement for EU citizens . <p> Instead , British negotiators would try to negotiate optimal EU market access through a separate free trade deal . If no headway is made , the government has indicated it could walk away from negotiations with no agreement . <p> ' Hard exit ' is a disconcerting message to campaign on , so the Conservative Party has framed the election as a question of ' strong and stable leadership ' . <p> By contrast , Jeremy Corbyn 's Labour Party -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softer ' departure . Labour has tried to finesse a half-and-half alternative : diluted EU membership , including continued access to the single market , and control over cross-border movement . <p> Here , again , restricted migration breaches freedom of movement ; one principle or the other must go . However , Labour has promised not to walk away from the negotiating table without some form of deal and will allow parliament a final say on its terms . <p> These electoral pledges on Brexit are largely ambit claims . The Article 50 process invests the bargaining power with the remaining 27 EU members . Whichever party wins will have to work with what it is given and May 's success in defining Brexit as a clarion for less immigration and legal independence means the decision between ' hard ' and ' soft ' is a superficial one . <h> The race between the Conservatives and Labour is becoming competitive <p> On April 18 , when May announced the snap election , a Times/YouGov poll had her government leading Labour by a historic 21 points , 44 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-year process of disengaging itself from the EU . Picture : Mick <p> Since then , the poll gap between Labour and the Conservatives has narrowed dramatically -- down to a five percent margin in the May 24-25 YouGov poll . <p> Labour 's comeback reveals that the Brexit election of June 8 , like Brexit itself , is really a proxy for shifting domestic issues . Economics and immigration are the critical drivers in contemporary British politics . <p> Interestingly , Labour 's 16-point surge seems to be derived largely from the release of its socially democratic election manifesto , which takes aim at privatisation , corporatisation , austerity budgets and safety net cuts - the legacies of Thatcherism . If Labour 's apparent support in opinion polls sticks it will reflect the role that opposition to austerity policies played in the Brexit referendum . <p> Support for the anti-EU anti-immigration UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) has collapsed from a high of 16 per cent just prior to Brexit down to around four per cent . With the issue of Britain 's place in Europe neutralised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the release of the Labour manifesto some might be migrating to Labour . <h> Scotland remains a wildcard <p> Scottish voters had their say in the Brexit referendum , but they strongly voted to remain part of the EU . The Brexit vote to leave has therefore the pro-independence movement , which in 2014 lost a referendum on independence . <p> The Scottish National Party ( SNP ) , which holds minority government in Scotland has demanded a second independence referendum before Brexit is finalised . Both May and Corbyn are opposed and Scottish opinion -- steady at 45 per cent for independence -- reflects a wait-and-see attitude . If negotiations with the EU go badly the SNP will seek to capitalise . <p> The June 8 election is unlikely to radically change the terms of Brexit . <p> But it will provide a window into the underlying issues that will determine the direction of Britain during Brexit and after : economic inequality , migration control , and what it means to be British University 's Privacy Officer at **30;932;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> Stopping the flu virus at the nose <p> Research finds special flu-fighting cells in our noses that not only stop the influenza virus in its tracks , but could also open the way for a one-shot flu vaccine <p> By Imogen Crump , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> A sneeze is often the first sign of a cold or flu . But a sneeze , or more accurately our noses , could be the secret to stopping the influenza virus in its tracks through what scientists are calling a " nasal border patrol " . <p> The research looks at stopping the flu virus in the nose before it enters the lungs . Picture : Tina <p> While previous research into a universal vaccine has focused on the flu-fighting powers of white blood cells residing in lung tissue , the drawback has always been that these cells die too quickly to be useful in developing a vaccine . But the nose is the main port of entry for inhaled pathogens such as influenza virus , and , up until now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We took a step back and thought , ' What if we could stop the virus in the nose before it made it to the lung ? ' " , says Dr Wakim , who specialises in microbiology and immunology . <p> " We moved our focus to investigating immune responses in nasal tissue , which is where the body first encounters flu viruses -- a kind of nasal border patrol . " <h> T cells by a nose <p> The researchers started by looking at a particular white blood cell -- the resident memory CD8 T cells or . Studies have already shown that these , located in the lungs , are excellent at protecting against different strains of flu and , for a while , it was thought they were the ideal cell type to be targeted by a new vaccine . The flu vaccine most people get each year works by stimulating white blood cells to produce the antibodies to fight a specific infection . But resident memory T cells , as their name might suggest , take up residence in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloodstream . <p> But there 's a catch - Trm cells in the lungs do not live very long . This took the research back to square one . <p> " We had identified a cell type that could provide great protection against different strains of influenza virus , but because they decayed so rapidly we would still have to constantly vaccinate the population , " says Dr Angela Pizzolla , a Research Fellow at University of Melbourne . <p> So , the team started thinking about how the flu virus actually gets into the body in the first place . <p> Generally , virus particles are inhaled into the upper airways and nose - this is where the infection starts . The virus then replicates and migrates down into the lungs , causing the severe respiratory symptoms associated with influenza infection . <p> The researchers then found a population of living in nasal tissue that , unlike their counterparts in the lung , can live for a very long time . They tracked these cells in lung and nasal tissue and found that while a population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to just 1000 cells over a period of 100 days , the cell population in the nasal tissue remained stable . <p> This means that the flu-fighting cells in the nasal tissue can potentially disable the inhaled influenza virus in the nose and upper airways , preventing the infection from reaching the lungs . It also means scientists could look at developing a vaccine that stimulates these in the nose , halting specific strains of virus before it even enters the respiratory system . <p> " We basically stopped influenza at the gates , " says Dr Wakim . <h> Fighting the flu <p> It 's highly contagious -- meaning it is very good at spreading from person to person . Which is usually why once one person in a family , workplace or school class becomes infected , a lot more people around them ultimately become sick . <p> But the virus is also a ' master of disguise ' . It 's very good at altering what it looks like on the surface , which can confuse our body 's immune system and prevent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " This is a big problem for influenza vaccine development . Our current flu vaccines work by training the body to recognise a component on the surface on an influenza virus particle , " says Dr Wakim . <p> Because the virus can change its appearance , it can actually evade our vaccines and this is why we need to be vaccinated against influenza virus every year . Scientists are constantly playing catch-up trying to predict what the next season 's circulating influenza virus will look like and then developing tailor-made vaccines to protect against the circulating strain . <p> Currently there 's a lot of scientific effort focusing on the development a " one-shot " flu vaccine . This is a vaccine that could be administered just once and provide long-term protection against any flu viruses you may encounter in your entire life -- including any pandemic strains . <p> It is why researchers are focusing on because these cells have the potential to provide protection against a variety of different influenza strains at the first site of infection . <p> " Instead of recognising external parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells are trained to recognise internal parts of the virus . These parts of the virus are equivalent to our internal organs , " says Dr Wakim . <p> It means a vaccine that induces flu fighting Trm cells in the nose could outwit the flu virus . <p> " We are now trying to work out the best way to lodge these flu-fighting cells in the nasal tissue , with the ultimate goal of developing a new vaccine that can provide long-term protection against University 's Privacy Officer at **30;774;TOOLONG

But that will not take effect until one year later -- 4 November , 2020 - one day after the next US Presidential election . <p> And a new President may rejoin by executive order -- perhaps on day one . <p> There are serious implications of President Trump 's announcement . It could give succour to other countries who are considering turning their backs on their agreed responsibilities .

Labour is angling for a ' softer ' exit , where Britain would retain membership of the single market in return for a degree of free movement of people . <p> Prime Minister May called the election saying she needed a mandate for Brexit .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Nowhere people have a right to somewhere <p> Over 10 million people are stateless , leaving them vulnerable to discrimination and exploitation , and legal argument is a critical battleground for finally tackling the problem <p> By Andrew Trounson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> When Ahmed arrived in Australia in 2000 on an Indonesian fishing boat , little did he know he would become a " nowhere man " facing indefinite detention . <p> Born in Kuwait from Palestinian refugee parents , Mr was stateless . It meant that when Australia rejected his refugee application there was no home to go to and no other country would take him . It was n't until 2003 that he was released and told to wait in limbo while authorities here tried to find somewhere to send him -- an effort they finally gave up on in 2007 when they granted him residency . By then the country 's High Court had infamously ruled that the government would have been within its rights to imprison him forever . <p> Syrian and Iraqi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island of Lesbos . Picture : Wikimedia <p> Mr 's story is one that is repeated in some form more than 10 million times a day around the world . That is the number of people the United Nations conservatively estimates are stateless . And that number is growing . According to the United Nations , a child is born stateless every 10 minutes . <p> " In our globalised and mobile world , the idea that someone does n't enjoy the protection and rights of a nationality can seem almost inconceivable , but it is the reality for millions of people , " says University of Melbourne 's associate dean of law research Professor Michelle Foster , who is set to lead a new research centre aimed at fighting statelessness that will be based at the Melbourne Law School . <p> Stateless people face daily discrimination , being excluded from the protection , education , healthcare and work rights that are regularly enjoyed by a country 's citizens . It leaves them exposed to exploitation , abuse , abduction and even slavery . There are international laws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not all countries have signed up and many of those that have signed are n't abiding by their obligations . <p> According to Professor Foster , it means a big part of ending statelessness is to bring the weight of those laws and obligations to bear on governments . <p> A key objective of The Peter McMullin Centre on Statelessness will be to provide research and expertise to support efforts in lobbying governments around the world to better protect stateless people and end it altogether by nationalising them . <p> The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has launched a global effort to end statelessness by 2024 and is pushing more countries to ratify agreements while pressuring those who have ratified agreements to meet their commitments . But Professor Foster says the success of the effort will also depend on taking the fight into domestic courts through so-called " strategic litigation " where legal expertise , such as the new Centre 's , will be crucial . <p> " The Centre will be focused on having an impact , and supporting local scholars and activists and non-government organisations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Professor Foster . " We will be working towards policy reforms no matter what avenue it takes , whether through research , education , talking to government , or supporting efforts at litigation . " <p> Accordingly the Centre will be providing training and extending legal expertise to activists and scholars . <p> It was only through litigation that some 250,000 Urdu speakers living in Bangladesh were awarded nationality in 2008 after being left stateless in the wake of the civil war there that had confirmed Bangladesh 's independence from Pakistan in 1971 . <p> A stateless child looks through a fence of a Thai school he is not permitted to attend . Picture : Joseph <p> A stateless person is defined under international law as " a person who is not considered as a national by any State under the operation of its law . " <p> There are many reasons why a person becomes stateless , but one of the most common is wholesale discrimination on the basis of ethnicity , race , religion and gender . Among the more than 10 million stateless people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar that number almost a million . But they also include the descendants of foreign workers and conflict refugees that have long been settled in host countries such as Cote d'Ivoire , where there are 700,000 stateless people , of which about 300,000 are foundling children . The break up of the Soviet Union stranded many ethnic Russians in former Soviet republics and there are over 250,000 stateless people in Latvia alone . <p> In some countries there also exist laws against women passing on nationality to their children , which continues to perpetuate statelessness . Some 27 countries have such laws , mostly in the Middle East and North Africa . <p> The UN 's 1954 Convention on statelessness explicitly sets out the rights and protections of stateless people , including their rights to basic things like education , housing and employment . The subsequent 1961 Convention requires countries to nationalise stateless children born within their borders . It also prevents countries from denationalising a citizen except in special cases . But out of the world 's 196 countries , only 83 have ratified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention . Of these many are n't meeting their obligations . <p> " At the time these conventions were being formulated post WWII I think there was an expectation that the problem would take care of itself but that is clearly not happening , " says Professor Foster . <p> It is why , she says , there has to be a focus on effecting change through domestic law courts . <p> " Such efforts can include arguing that other human rights laws and treaties , like the Refugee Convention , should apply to stateless people given that the effect of statelessness is often human rights violations . <p> " We need to understand legally that statelessness itself can be seen as a form of persecution . Even in cases where statelessness itself is n't the result of persecution , what stateless people suffer is tantamount to persecution . " <p> According to Professor Foster , Australia is one of the countries not meeting its obligations under the 1954 convention , as illustrated by the case of Ahmed . She says that under the 1954 Convention stateless people should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that if you do n't have a visa you are either sent home or detained , which means stateless people are often simply detained like Mr . There is simply no system in place for protecting stateless people . " <p> Up to date figures on the number of stateless people held in Australian detention facilities are n't readily available , but according to the most recent government figures available , which date back to April 2015 , there were 81 stateless people held in detention . The latest March 2017 figures do n't detail the number of stateless people held in detention , but do report that there are 56 stateless people outside detention and approved to live in the community . <p> Australia 's 2014 Counter Terrorism Legislation Amendment allows the government to strip dual nationals involved in terrorism of their citizenship , but Professor Foster says there are currently inadequate provisions in place to check that a convicted terrorist does indeed have a dual-nationality ; without that , the legislation could make people stateless and be in breach of the 1961 Convention . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prosecute and punish our criminals accordingly . By stripping someone of their nationality we are just absolving ourselves of that responsibility and because people have to end up somewhere , we are just passing on the problem to someone else , " she says . <p> " One of the huge contributions this centre can make is in education and raising awareness of the issue . In many countries such as Australia there is very little understanding of statelessness , or when there is people think it is a problem elsewhere .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Chemical restraint : Behind locked doors <p> In Australia , the use of psychotropic drugs to calm or control behaviour is largely unregulated , and questions have been raised over their misuse . Now , the time has come for definition and regulation . <p> By Professor Bernadette McSherry , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Earlier this month , CCTV footage emerged showing Miriam Merten , naked and disoriented in an Australian hospital . Ms Merten falls backwards several times in a cell-like room , before walking to the door and banging on a small window . The video then shifts to the corridor outside the room . She shuffles , still naked , and falls again . <p> Ms Merten died from a brain injury in 2014 after she fell more than 20 times inside the Mental Health Unit of Lismore Base Hospital . While there has already been a coronial inquiry , the publicity surrounding this CCTV footage has led to a New South Wales parliamentary inquiry . <p> These appalling events raise many issues , one of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merten 's behaviour . An important question is whether the dosage of these drugs contributed to her falls , and ultimately , her death . <p> Miriam Merten had been ' chemically restrained ' prior to her death in 2014 . Picture : CCTV footage <p> My research indicates that the use of medication to control behaviour in health care settings is poorly regulated across Australia . These findings form part of an Australian Research Council funded Discovery project which aims to provide health practitioners , and the individuals in their care , with a clear and consistent legal framework for reducing , and ideally eliminating , the use of interventions such as physical restraint , where bodily force is used to restrict movement ; mechanical restraint , where devices such as belts and wrist cuffs are used ; and medication to control behaviour . <h> OVER-USE AND <p> The ABC has been investigating reports of the over-prescription of psychotropic drugs to control the behaviour of people with disabilities . A study conducted in the United Kingdom in 2015 found that as many as 71 per cent of adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no record of a diagnosis of mental illness . <p> Here in Australia , the Victorian Office of the Senior Practitioner has reported that the use of medication to control behaviour , generally called ' chemical restraint ' , has been the most commonly used form of restraint in the aged care sector . The Australian Law Reform Commission has also raised concerns that chemical restraint is widely used on individuals diagnosed with dementia . In England , the over-prescription of anti-psychotic medications in aged care has been linked to 1800 deaths a year . <p> There are concerns that chemical restraint is widely used in the aged care sector , particularly for people with dementia . Picture : Pixabay <p> It is impossible to know the extent of this problem in Australia because there is no national database for recording the dosage or circumstances in which psychotropic medications are prescribed . This is of particular concern when they are prescribed without consent . <h> LACK OF REGULATION <p> The use of chemical restraint is poorly regulated across health care sectors , partly because , as the South Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> A strong starting point to defining what chemical restraint means is found in section 3 of Tasmania 's Mental Health Act 2013 , which is echoed in some disability legislation , as " medication given primarily to control a person 's behaviour , not to treat a mental illness or physical condition " . <p> In recent years , there have been concerted efforts to reduce the use of seclusion , physical and bodily restraint in mental health facilities . Gains have been made in regulating and reducing the use of seclusion , although the 2015-2016 data suggest a worrying slight upward trend . <p> At a recent forum held in Perth on the issue , data concerning the rates of physical and mechanical restraint were released for the first time . Although drawing comparisons across jurisdictions is difficult because of inconsistent reporting requirements across the states and territories , at least getting the information together is a step in the right direction . <p> Chemical restraint should be the next practice that is defined and regulated . There may , of course , be difficulties in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to treat a mental health condition may have strong sedative effects , thus affecting behaviour . In such circumstances , it may be impossible to prove an intention to control behaviour rather than to treat a medical condition . <p> There is also a fine line between chemical restraint and what is considered to be ' emergency sedation ' or ' rapid tranquillisation ' , where the aim is to reduce specific symptoms of behavioural disturbance rather than treat an underlying cause . <p> There is also clearly a gap between how mental health service users and practitioners view chemical restraint . An interdisciplinary study conducted for the National Mental Health Commission surveyed mental health service users , their carers and practitioners about whether it was feasible to eliminate chemical restraint . Sixty-two per cent of mental health service users agreed it was feasible , but only 14 per cent of mental health practitioners agreed elimination is realistic . Why there is such a gap remains to be explored . <p> Some form of regulation , be it via legislation or national guidelines , is better than having none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdictions . Some form of data collection on the use of medication without consent in health care settings would provide information about the extent of the use of medication to control behaviour . <p> For example , in the Netherlands , the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate , which has extensive powers to investigate and assess the quality of health services , prevention measures and medical products , receives reports on all restrictive and coercive interventions , including the use of involuntary medication . <h> GLOBAL EFFORTS <p> Internationally , the World Health Organization has launched a ' Quality Rights Initiative ' aimed at improving care in mental health facilities . It is also in the process of developing training modules , including one on strategies to end the use of seclusion and all forms of restraint , including chemical restraint . These modules may provide a useful framework for other health care facilities . <p> While there are still many obstacles on the road towards eliminating restrictive practices , it is heartening to see that in Wales , a service-user designed facility is leading the way in focusing on recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melbourne Social Equity Institute , on behalf of the National Mental Health Commission , found that environmental changes are high on the list of factors that reduce the use of seclusion and restraint . <p> Ultimately , if people are given power over others behind locked doors , things will go wrong without clear regulations and constant monitoring .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Children speak out on family violence <p> Interviews with children and young people whose fathers use violence reveals that they require their Dads make amends so they can move on . Their voices are now being used in fathering programs <p> By Andrew Trounson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Readers are advised that the following story is about family violence and may be distressing . <p> Children and young people believe that fathers who use family violence need to be made more accountable , and it should be up to them , not the community or the courts , to decide whether they have anything to do with their Dads . <p> That 's the message from a new study into the perspectives of children and young people whose fathers have used family violence , whether it is physical and/or emotional abuse . <p> These feelings of children and young people who have suffered family violence are seldom listened to , but University of Melbourne researcher Dr Katie Lamb discovered that when asked they had plenty to say - some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is like to fear your father . <p> " It 's kind of like having a monster in the closet who sometimes buys you a Christmas present " said one study participant . <p> " Children 's perspectives on their relationship with fathers who use violence rarely figure in the research literature or in the legal processes dealing with family violence . But when I came to talking to them I was blown away by exactly how strong their views were , whether it was an older young person or a child as young as a nine year old , " says Dr Lamb . " They all in some way wanted their fathers to acknowledge that what they had done was wrong and apologise . " <p> Some told her that they just wanted their father to go away , to prison preferably . Others wanted to rebuild their relationships with their Dads , but only on their terms . <p> But she found that common to all of them was a demand that their Dad make reparations in some way - to try to make amends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just so that they could move on with their lives . <p> Some of the participants have since gone on to record their experiences as ' digital stories ' for use in programs designed to change the behaviours of fathers who use violence , in a project funded by the Luke Batty Foundation . <p> " Even those children who wanted no further relationship with their fathers still saw reparation as being important to their own healing and giving them closure , " says Dr Katie Lamb , who carried out the study as part of her doctoral research in collaboration with University of Melbourne 's Research Alliance to End Violence Against Women and their Children ( ) , supervised by Professor Cathy Humphreys and Professor Kelsey Hegarty . <p> The problem is , she says , there is little opportunity in the social or legal system to make fathers who use violence accountable to their children , and this needs to change both for the sake of the victims and the perpetrators . <p> A criminologist who is now a Human Services management consultant at KPMG , Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides an important insight into how the system is failing to acknowledge the needs of children and young people who have experienced family violence . <p> She says many told her they felt pressured by community expectations to forgive their fathers and accept them back into their lives . And they felt left out of processes attempting to hold fathers who use violence to account . <p> " They had really strong views on what they wanted their fathers to learn and what their fathers needed to know about how they had hurt them . And they wanted their voices to be heard in programs for fathers who use violence . " <p> Dr Lamb says that the children and young people she interviewed felt frustrated that they were n't consulted on what should happen to their fathers , and they felt that authorities put pressure on them to accept their fathers had a right to stay in their lives . <p> Dr Lamb says an important message from her study was that all the children wanted to be in control of what their future relationship with their fathers looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel currently that was how it was looked at by adults , and that it was very much expected the child would simply forgive and forget . " <p> " He denied all the abuse and stuff ... and maybe if he 'd done some time in prison and apologised for what he did I 'd probably - you know , I might think about seeing him " - study participant . <p> " Once I thought an apology was all you needed . But I do n't think that would even be enough . I need to see your actions have changed " - study participant . <p> Dr Lamb interviewed 16 children and young people aged between 9 and 19 who had been the victims of family violence perpetrated by their fathers . The study was partly motivated by her experience working with male prisoners during her previous work managing programs in the Victorian justice system . She realised that fathers in prison were often concerned about their relationship with their children . <p> " It was sometimes very surprising to see these pretty rough looking men hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving them advice on how to interact with their children . I could see it was a pivotal issue for them and was something that could help motivate fathers to change . " <p> Dr Lamb said it was critically important for fathers who use violence to hear the voices of children to combat the still pervasive idea that men who are violent to their partners can still be good fathers . She says the existing research is clear that experiencing family violence is bad for children . She says fathers who use violence can sometimes try to avoid facing up to their actions by thinking they can still be good fathers , and it is an idea still given some credence in the court system . <p> " There is an assumption that a man who uses family violence can still be a valuable father , but the evidence does n't support that and this study does n't support that . Significant acts of reparation may be required . " <p> It is why she says it is important that fathers who use violence be made to feel accountable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that their fathers are accountable for the hurt they have inflicted on them . <p> The Children 's Protection Society and UnitingCare ReGen have begun using the digital stories from the study in one of their intervention programs for fathers who use violence and according to a CPS clinical practitioner , the effect of listening to children speak is proving to be a cathartic experience for many of the men . <p> " The video had a profound impact on the group and opened up a reflective discussion on the impact of family violence , " says Ms Edwards , who is facilitating a pilot of the Canadian-based Caring Dads intervention program . " One of the men said he felt like crying to think that his actions had badly affected his children , and the group generally was shocked by what they heard . <p> " It is one way of motivating them to change because they do n't want to hurt and alienate their children , " Ms Edwards says . <p> " We were products of her ( our mother ) , so we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - study participant . <p> " When I 'm angry , I 'll want to hit stuff and want to act out because that 's what I 've seen my father do ... And like I do n't want to be that person " - study participant . <p> When Dr Lamb approached the young people to anonymously record their views as digital stories for use in rehabilitation programs , she says many of them jumped at the chance . She says they were " bursting " to be heard and to make a difference . <p> " People ask me if this work was depressing or sad but I did n't feel that way , " she says . " It has been really inspiring .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> France clearly ' On the Move ' <p> President Macron 's young party has won an overall majority in the French parliament , but with relatively low voter turnout their mandate for radical change is n't absolute <p> By Professor Peter McPhee , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Emmanuel Macron launched his political party En Marche ! -- now La R ? publique en Marche ! ( The Republic on the Move ! ) -- not much more than a year ago . Now , not only has President Macron himself become France 's youngest ever elected leader , but his party has dominated France 's parliamentary elections . <p> In the second-round or run-off elections , La R ? publique en Marche ! ( LRM ) candidates won 350 of the 577 constituencies - fewer than projected , but this is a huge victory . It is one of the greatest landslides since Charles de Gaulle 's team won more than 80 per cent of seats in elections after the collapse and repression of the student revolts in May 1968 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Les R ? , but it will see its number of seats fall , from 199 to 126 . The Parti Socialiste ( PS ) , which had been in power since 2012 , has been the biggest loser , going from 289 seats to 46 ( and with it losing the vast public funding which , as in Australia , is based on votes received ) . Even the party leader , Jean-Christophe ? lis , lost the seat in Paris he had held for 20 years . While every existing party across the spectrum lost voters to LRM , it was above all the PS voters who deserted in droves . <p> La R ? publique En Marche ! has achieved an overall majority in the French parliament . Picture : Wikimedia <p> The election was equally disastrous for the Front National of Marine Le Pen . After her historic high of 33.5 per cent in the May Presidential Elections , she had high hopes of reaching the hurdle of 15 seats , which increases a party 's speaking rights in the National Assembly . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only eight seats . Recriminations have opened up within the party between those who see its future as adopting the strident anti-elite and anti-EU messages that might appeal to angry leftist voters , and others who see its popularity as based above all in tough stances on migrants and refugees , and on border security . <p> The PS has been fortunate to outpoll the hard left La France Insoumise ( France Unbowed ) headed by Jean-Luc M ? lenchon and remain the largest party of the left . LFI is projected to win 16 seats -- enough to form a parliamentary group -- but , even with its Communist Party allies ( 10 seat ) , it is not big enough to claim to be the main left-wing opposition force against President Macron . <p> So how can President Macron 's success be explained ? The positive explanation is that he is a very smart man who has not put a foot wrong since running for President on a frankly pro-European platform . He gave Europe as well as France a shot in the arm with his decisive victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his inclusiveness and his willingness to stand up courteously but bluntly to both Trump and Putin . Who will forget that white-knuckle handshake with Trump ? And he has rejuvenated parliament : most of the LRM deputies are new to public office and younger : their average age is 43 . <p> The negative explanation is worrying . The LRM candidates did so well because FN and LFI voters stayed away from the polls . President Macron may find that he has a massive majority in the National Assembly -- now half composed of political neophytes -- but outside parliament awaits a majority of citizenry sceptical of the supposed benefits of free-market reform . <p> President Emmanuel Macron has famously said his handshake with President Donald Trump was a " moment of truth " . Picture : Getty Images <p> President Macron 's cabinet has already indicated the broad character of the government he will lead . This is a cabinet which balances men and women ( 11 each ) -- although the most senior positions are held by men - from a range of ideological backgrounds . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balances liberal economic policy with progressive attitudes to the environment and social issues . <p> The tough posts on the economy have gone to men from centre right parties -- the Prime Minister ? douard Philippe and the Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire -- while Macron has appointed a prominent ecologist Nicolas Hulot as Minister for the Environment , and a Socialist Party Mayor of Lyon G ? rard as Interior Minister . The most senior women are Defence Minster Sylvie Goulard , Labor Minister Muriel Penicaud , and Health Minister Agnes Buzyn . It is a government with ideological parallels to those of former US President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau . <p> President Macron faces challenges that have proved too great for his predecessors for forty years , and which confront most of Europe -- what can be done about long-term double digit unemployment which hits at least 25 per cent of young people ? And how can deep ' communitarian ' rifts and mistrust be healed between unemployed , disaffected young people from migrant backgrounds , particularly North Africans ? <p> The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - in reality or in perception - undermining France 's social protections . His task has been made more challenging by the low participation rate in the election ( 43.5 per cent ) , which makes it difficult to claim a popular mandate for radical change . It is clear President Macron 's voters were disproportionately very educated , employed residents of major cities , not the disaffected and unemployed of the suburbs and country towns . <p> President Macron 's domination of parliament could give him a relatively free rein to push through his plans to loosen France 's extensive labour laws and change the welfare system on pensions and unemployment benefits . But he will be acutely aware of the large-scale street protests that forced him to compromise one year ago when he attempted similar reforms when a minister in the government led by Francois Hollande . While only 8 per cent of the French workforce is unionised , organised labour has a long and successful history of collective action to protect entrenched benefits . <p> The majority of French people want President Macron to succeed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McPhee has published widely on the history of modern France .

 <p> This year 's Victorian state budget included a $1.9 billion package to tackle family violence . Part of this was a statewide Personal Safety Initiative , which expands a trial of installing technology -- such as CCTV , personal alarms and security doors -- in the homes of at-risk women . <p> CCTV installed in victims ' homes has been commended for reducing intervention order breaches . Picture : George <p> While the Victorian Government should be commended for recognising that support for victims should be increased , a reliance on security technology like this to resolve embedded social problems may be misguided . <p> Several recent cases of suspected domestic violence that have led to allegations of murder highlights the shortfalls of CCTV-based evidence in cases like these , whether it 's used as evidence for the prosecution or the defence . <p> It means that key issues regarding the use of CCTV in responses to family violence must be reconsidered , and the question asked : while CCTV footage may have helped achieve convictions in some cases , can it help in the reduction of violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used <p> A recent report estimated more than 160,000 people experienced family violence in Victoria in 2015-16 . This cost the state $5.3 billion . Around $2.6 billion of this stemmed from individuals ' pain , suffering , physical and psychological health impacts and loss of income . <p> In this context , the $17 million announced for the installation of technology like CCTV seems relatively small . But following a " successful " pilot program , CCTV installed in victims ' homes was commended for reducing intervention order breaches , and for working as evidence in court to demonstrate when breaches did occur . <p> Technologies like CCTV are attractive in terms of policing . Visual evidence has a lot of currency for criminal and civil proceedings . Victoria Police is trialling body-worn cameras when attending family violence incident scenes for this reason . CCTV may also be useful in courtroom settings to reduce the need for a victim to encounter their offender . <p> While technology may be used well in these instances , the expansion of such programs into the home necessitates a closer consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not tackle the underlying causes of violence , displacement of crime -- where there is a relocation of crime as a result of crime-prevention efforts -- often follows . In the context of family violence , this means that while a victim may be temporarily safe in her home her other movements , like leaving for work , may become riskier . There is a danger that this could create new forms of isolation . <p> A victim may be temporarily safe at home , but other movements may become riskier . Picture : Wikimedia <p> There also needs to be an awareness of how CCTV is positioned around the property as it could have significant impact on its effectiveness . If it is only facing outside , then a camera can misinterpret the conditions in which someone enters the home . <p> It 's also worth considering that family violence can be coercive in more ways than sexual and physical aggression . Economic and psychological violence is also often prevalent , and these behaviours will not be visible to a camera . CCTV may not be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide financial support for children unless conditions are met or , say , threats to self-harm . <p> Family violence is also complex and traumatic for victims . Feelings of shame or a belief that it " might get better " may also come into the mix . If footage emerges of a victim talking to , engaging with or inviting in a perpetrator , this may be used against a victim to shift blame and perpetuate myths that minimise or excuse violent behaviour . <p> It 's also important that there are proper safeguards in place around the use of CCTV footage used as evidence to prevent this . As well as considering the extreme implications for proportionality and privacy of cameras inside the home . <p> The CCTV cameras used in the Victorian trial were connected to static internet addresses . Victims were not provided with direct access , instead , they were given an application on their phone to check the cameras before going outside or coming home . This means that a number of hardware and software is used in this operation , and facilitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of cyber-security for the CCTV cameras themselves . Last year , hackers compromised more than 25,000 digital video recorders and CCTV cameras in a single attack . Before installing any sort of surveillance device into the homes of thousands of vulnerable families , strict cyber-security measures need to be properly evaluated and adhered to . <h> Where we should focus our attention <p> Like an apprehended violence order , the installation of CCTV cameras in the most extreme cases of family violence may be beneficial in temporarily disrupting the threat of physical abuse .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Cladding fires : a fatal warning of a bigger problem <p> As authorities continue their investigations into the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower in London that claimed up to 79 lives , questions persist over the role cladding played in the speed and spread of the blaze . It begs the bigger question -- how do we prevent this happening again ? <p> By Giorgio , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> The disastrous Grenfell Tower fire in London shocked the world ; and raised many questions about the safety of contemporary , tall , residential buildings . British authorities are still unearthing evidence necessary to pin down the exact causes and dynamics of the incident . But the preliminary consensus among experts points to a well-known problem : fires in building cladding , spread by composite metal panels with polyethylene backing . <p> The problem is well known in Australia , where in November 2014 a cigarette butt in a plastic container was enough to ignite a fa ? ade of metal panels on an apartment building in Melbourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a balcony wall was lit , the fire spread quickly . It travelled up the side of the building in 11 minutes . Fortunately , casualties were prevented by the limited amount of panels involved , the prompt response of the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade ( MMFB ) , and the timely activation of internal sprinklers . <p> Part of the Grenfell Tower following the blaze . Picture : <p> The ensuing incident report sparked a media frenzy . The concerns raised by the MMFB were many . Several similar cladding fires in residential buildings had occurred recently around the world ( in Dubai , Shanghai and Europe ) , taking many by surprise . But the big surprise and concern was that the polyethylene cladding involved had never been tested for flammability according to Australian standards , or equivalent international standards . <p> The technical information necessary to understand this issue is simple . Under severe fire conditions timber chars , concrete spalls , steel melts , glass breaks and plastics burn . But polyethylene , which is a plastic , behaves differently to most structural building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , break , fall or melt : it inflames and spreads fire . Tall building fa ? ades clad with panels where a thin veneer of aluminium is mounted on a polyethylene core ( or " black core ' ) , can potentially transfer a fire , very quickly from one floor to the next , with terrible consequences . <p> The good news is that most modern building codes , standards and regulations have come to terms with this issue . Most have learnt from the past , and fa ? ades must now be constructed out of non-combustible material . Fa ? ades may burn shortly , spall , deform and break glass , but they can not add fuel to a fire . It is as simple as that . <p> So are these incidents isolated cases of negligence ? Is it sufficient for the public to seek and identify a handful of dodgy manufacturers , unscrupulous importers or contractors who import sub-standard materials in our progressive projects and smart construction sites ? Unfortunately , it 's not that simple . <p> The big problem is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , composite metal panels with aluminium facing are already everywhere , indoors and outdoors . They have been used in thousands of projects worldwide from the 1970s to present times . metal panels are all around us -- in apartment buildings , office buildings , supermarkets , commercial centres and , possibly even in schools , hospitals and universities . <p> Shiny samples of the material still abound in the show rooms of architects and builders . It has been used for years in presentation boards prepared for the approval of clients , councillors and ministers . The material is still indicated on architectural and shop drawings worldwide , while quantity surveyors and design managers often select the metal-plastic composite option as the much more affordable alternative to costly metal cladding . <p> The interior of an apartment in Grenfell Tower showing the fire resistance of the concrete structure . Picture : UK Met Police <p> So how is this possible ? Could disaster happen again ? <p> This question is more pertinent than ever , and further research should look at the current proliferation in Australian cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's around this area of high-volume , low-cost residential construction that important questions need to be asked ; particularly the associated socio-economic issues that are the hardest to dissect and respond to . <p> The technical problem is easy to fix . Polyethylene is combustible , and should never be used again in fa ? ades . Given its widespread use and misuse , architects could easily refuse to specify composite metal panels mounted on polyethylene from now on : everywhere , and not only in tall buildings . And manufacturers could stop the production of this backing material and concentrate efforts on their safer , inflammable alternatives . <p> Since the mid-1980s , in the name of innovation and productivity , the construction regulations of several countries , including Australia , have become less rigorous and prescriptive . In simplified terms , today 's performance-based code would state : " a fa ? ade must not be combustible ; how you do so in detail is not for the code to tell , so long as it is not combustible " . <p> By contrast , a prescriptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " a fa ? ade in a high-rise building , in order to prevent the vertical spread of fire , should have a 900mm deep concrete spandrel able to resist fire for at least three hours . " <p> The performance-based approach leaves the field open to alternative solutions , and innovation . Recent research by the University of Melbourne has looked at the key role of designers , specialist consultants and contractors as the gatekeepers of quality and safety when it comes to the construction of facades . It is these experts who should collaborate , calculate risks and make arguments and proposals on a case-by-case basis for the approval of the relevant authorities . <p> The prescriptive rules of the past were far from being perfect , but the widespread use of composite metal panels with polyethylene core shows the vulnerability of the present approach , which in some cases , may have departed too far from best practice . Cladding fires of recent times indicate that about risk may have been made or that measures to verify the details of these measures were inadequate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there is any significant lesson to learn from this tragedy it is that we need to be prepared to get to the core of the problem and not limit our inquiries on the rediscovery of the obvious : fa ?

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Daring to learn how to learn <p> A study of over 100,000 online learners finds that learning is a skill in itself that involves being prepared to take a risk , engaging with peers and having an independent streak <p> By Associate Professor Sandra Milligan , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Why do some of us learn easily and quickly , while others struggle , left behind plodding along ? <p> Part of the answer , at least in the online learning space , is that learning is a real skill in of itself , and some people are more skilled at it than others . And the good news for the plodders is that it is a skill that can be readily grasped when we break it down . <p> I 've analysed the data from over 100,000 learners on the University of Melbourne 's various MOOCs ( Massive Open Online Courses ) - every click , tap , swipe they make , every document they consult , and every word they write in chat forums and exercises . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and which do n't . It means that it should be possible to design online learning systems that not only teach skills and knowledge , but also at the same time teaches students how to best learn . <p> Skilled online learners are active , collaborative , independent , prepared to take risks and are not frightened of embarrassment . Picture : Ewan <p> Overall , the analysis suggest that learners with lower levels of learning expertise are likely to be passive in their behaviour . That is , they receive input , limit their interaction to consuming content supplied by the teacher , and are unengaged with their peers , taking responsibility only for themselves . They seek guidance only from authoritative figures about what to read or think , and adhere to contexts and perspectives similar to their own . They regard learning as the mastery of reasonably static , generalisable knowledge , easily transferred in books , or by lectures . <p> Expert learners , by contrast , are likely to scan different sources of information , seeking out a range of potential sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat volatile , context dependent , widely distributed , and including tacit understandings , as well as generalisable understandings . <p> They actively seek out the views of others and conduct dialogues with peers in which they collaborate , mentor , and even teach their fellow students . They actively review and consider the perspective of others , and are critically aware . They are prepared to reject anything they see as unhelpful , and are independent-minded enough to take the social risk of expressing a contrary view . They produce learning artefacts , try out new ideas and skills , potentially risking public failure and embarrassment , and they share learning activities and resources with others . They interact with feedback to exhaust its value for learning and provide feedback themselves to peers and evaluate peer performances . <p> The study found that 90 per cent of learners from any MOOC could be reliably grouped along this curve of learning skill by analysing their behaviours in the log stream of online courses . I found that an individual 's position on the learning skill progression was a good predictor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this progression describes the differences between learners more or less skilled in learning in MOOCs , and supports the view that learning is itself a learnable and transferable skill . It means that people can get better at learning if they know how to go about learning to learn . Indeed , it is possible that the progression captures something about learning skill in general , and that it can easily be adapted to any learning by anybody at any level . <p> By analysing the progression of learners I was able to identify five distinct levels of learning : <p> Level 1 : Reader -- MOOC as a textbook <p> Level 2 : Consumer of Instruction -- MOOC as a tutor <p> Level 3 : Self-regulated producer of learning -- MOOC as a tutor with a user support group . <p> For me the most exciting aspect of the research is the potential for putting it to work . <p> Because the analyses are based on learning progressions along which individuals develop , and not just an end result , assessments of expertise in learning can be fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOOCS . That feedback could show every learner the level of expertise in learning they are at , together with hints , encouragement , suggestions and resources to help them move to the next level of learning expertise .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Rebuilding cultural heritage after disaster <p> After an earthquake devastated the Philippines , conservators went beyond conventional cultural conservation practices and involved the local community in the restoration of their churches <p> By Ben Rodin , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> In 2013 , the Philippines was struck by its deadliest earthquake in 23 years . <p> More than 200 people died . Across the country , around 73,000 buildings and structures were damaged and more than 14,500 were totally destroyed . <p> The island province of Bohol , which sits near the centre of the Philippines , was one of the hardest hit areas . And at the time , authorities estimated that the entire population of the province was affected by the quake . <p> The Nuestra Se ? ora de la Luz Parish Church in Loon , Bohol , was reduced to rubble in the quake . Picture : Project <p> But it was the damage , and in some cases destruction , of more than ten heritage-listed churches in the region that came at significant cultural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people identify as Catholic . The cost of restoring the churches was estimated at almost $29 million . But their significance to the local community was priceless . <p> Dr Nicole Tse , an expert in conservation at the University of Melbourne , investigated the damage to the churches following the earthquake , working alongside the Philippines ' National Museum recovery team . Just gaining access to the sites through the devastation was challenging . <p> " The roads were blocked ; there were no aeroplanes . Everyone was just so numb and struck by this terrible disaster , " says Dr Tse , who is based at the Grimwade Centre for Cultural Materials Conservation . <p> The team was initially concerned about the priority of the work amid so much destruction , but it quickly became apparent that the local community not only wanted their churches back , they wanted to be involved in the repair work itself . <p> " The situation with rebuilding cultural heritage after disasters is : What do you do ? When do you do it ? And how do you do it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become important to people ? " Dr Tse says . <p> " It 's hard to encapsulate in words the feeling when the tangible evidence of what you believe , which is central to your community and your way of life , is destroyed . " <p> She says this led to the strong community impulse to rebuild . <p> " The rebuilding of the church structures cements historical and familial links that go back centuries and move it in to the future . " <p> The people had a choice to make between rebuilding the existing churches or building brand new places to worship in . They elected to rebuild and repair the churches ; a job which is expected to take between 10 and 20 years . <p> Restoration work had to respect the community 's request to keep objects in the church .

If I approach it from a professional point of view , it 's good to have a centralised lab where you can put these things together . But the challenges of keeping the objects in the church also mean that there 's a lot more community investment into what 's being done . " <p> The conferences are the ongoing outcome of two earlier research projects at the University of Melbourne -- The Behaviour of Western Artists ' Materials in Tropical Climates and The 20th Century in Paint project - that Dr. Tse says attempt to challenge traditional , Eurocentric views of cultural material conservation . <p> " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American and European infrastructure , but there is a lot of technical knowledge in South East Asia and among the membership that needs to be shared amongst us , " says Dr Tse who founded the research network with the University of Melbourne 's Professor Robyn Sloggett in 2009 . <p> She also says it was crucial to recognise that established cultural conservation practices faced unique challenges in Bohol because the buildings were so central to people 's faith . <p> Dr Tse says that the Grimwade Centre has a strong relationship with Bohol with ongoing research , internships and other dialogue . Rosie Cook , Amy Heffernan , Karen Wilcox and Elizabeth Long , four graduates of the Master of Cultural Materials Conservation , continued work with church communities after the conference . <p> One of Dr Tse 's current students , Pam Soriano , who is Filippino herself , returned to the country to complete a placement with the National Museum of Philippines . <p> The facade of a church in Clarin , Bohol , remains standing after Philippines ' earthquake .

There 's an appetite for having discussions that are n't in your space but which create things that work across a whole lot of disciplines . <p> " You feel ethically stronger about what you 're doing and the decisions you 're making .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> The common insecticide poisoning our rivers and wetlands <p> Why is a toxic household insecticide being found in wetlands around new housing estates in Melbourne ? <p> By Associate Professor Vincent Pettigrove , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Urban streams and wetlands play an important role in the proper functioning of our cities . They protect our houses from floods , provide green spaces for recreation , trap and breakdown pollutants and provide valuable habitats for many native plants , insects , reptiles , amphibians and birds . <p> In Melbourne , like in many cities across the world , much of our native wetland has been drained for housing and other infrastructure , and our creeks and rivers turned into concrete channels . But in recent decades , as the value of these habitats has become clear , there has been a concerted effort to reverse this trend , and hundreds of ' constructed ' wetlands have been built . <p> A view of Melbourne from Cheetham Wetlands near Point Cook . Picture : <p> Protecting these wetlands and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncovered a nearly four-fold rise in the last five years in the presence of a particularly toxic chemical in wetland sediments . Moreover it would seem the chemical , bifenthrin , an insecticide , is killing our aquatic life . <p> Our focus was not on the pollutants in the water itself , but on those that had accumulated in the sediment at the bottom of these wetlands . We tested what chemicals were present , and how toxic these were to bugs that live in and around the sediment . <p> As expected , we identified a range of pollutants , but what surprised us is that bifenthrin was clearly causing more ecological damage than the rest . <p> Bifenthrin is a synthetic insecticide . It is found in many common household surface sprays that are advertised as providing safe , long-term protection against infestation from insects . It is cheap and effective . <p> It is toxic to insects , spiders , mites and fish , but believed to be relatively safe to humans and other mammals . Because of its purpose as a persistent insect barrier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a local wetland , it will stick around and cause long-term damage . <p> In 2012 , we found bifenthrin in about 20 per cent of Melbourne 's wetlands , but in our most recent survey , that had risen to 75 per cent of wetlands with potentially toxic concentrations . When we tested this sediment using a small native waterbug called an amphipod , 40 of the 99 wetlands we surveyed had sediments toxic enough to kill the animal . <p> Our partners are concerned about environmental concentrations of bifenthrin too . EPA Victoria have received reports of deaths of aquatic life and their testing has shown bifenthrin was the most likely culprit . <p> What is most surprising about this is that bifenthrin should n't be in these sediments at all . Bifenthrin does not dissolve in water , so it should n't wash into stormwater drains when it rains , although some inevitably will if attached to particles like dust and soil . But even then , these particles should be blocked before reaching our wetlands . <p> Wetlands in the Melbourne suburb of North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader in water-sensitive urban design and our stormwater goes through a number of barriers -- such as gravel pits and vegetation -- before it reaches a wetland . These barriers are designed to trap the kinds of particles that bifenthrin attaches to . <p> Where then is all of this bifenthrin coming from ? The short answer is we do n't really know , and DELWP is convening a new committee to deal with this mystery . However from our study we can glean a few hints . <p> We would expect high concentrations of bifenthrin in areas with termite infestations , but we found the highest concentrations of bifenthrin in peri-urban areas , especially in new housing estates . This suggests that the main source of bifenthrin is from pests , especially termite , control applications . <p> And rather than working its way through the stormwater system , bifenthrin may instead bypass this and be carried through the air on dust particles . Bifenthrin is applied in several different ways , including as a layer beneath the concrete slab , or in a drip irrigation system around new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Understanding what ultimately happens to bifenthrin treatments will allow us to make recommendations on ways to protect new houses without causing undue ecological damage . <p> We do n't think Melbourne is in any way unusual in having high concentrations of this insecticide in its urban wetlands . California has also recognised the risk from bifenthrin and is trying to implement changes to the way it is used . However , in other Australian cities it is not clear whether this issue is being considered . <p> To address this emerging ecological threat , , EPA Victoria , DELWP and Melbourne Water will be working with residential urban developers to identify sources of bifenthrin and further assess its environmental impact . <p> Collaboration with pesticides regulators at the state and federal level , including the Australian Pesticide and Veterinary Medicines Authority ( APVMA ) will also be necessary to adequately manage insecticide pollution in urban University 's Privacy Officer at **30;31;TOOLONG 
 <h> Surviving menopause with some ( self ) kindness <p> A cooling dash to the fridge is a common coping tactic for the 80 per cent or so of mid-life women who experience menopausal hot flushes . <p> Hot flushes can have a big impact on daily life , especially on sleep , work and mood . But my research shows that the fridge is not the only drug-free solution ; learning how to be kind to ourselves can also make a big difference . <p> Wellbeing is often taken for granted . Our own wellbeing is not a fixed trait , however , but a learnable skill . Fostering psychological resilience through strategies like self-compassion can help us better manage life 's inevitable changes -- including some physical health symptoms , like hot flushes . <p> While hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) can help some women manage hot flushes , HRT is not effective or safe for all women . Psychological coping strategies can be powerful tools to help women navigate the menopause transition . <p> Self-compassion involves treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a natural gift for empathy , often knowing the right thing to say to make others feel better , research shows that we are n't so kind to ourselves . Self-compassion does n't always come naturally . <p> Instead , women often fall into a trap of giving endlessly to others whilst leaving no time or energy to care for themselves . This is a recipe for burnout -- especially at midlife when commitments are often hectic . <h> How self-compassion helps <p> Midlife women are under enormous pressure . By the time they have reached their late forties , they may have new responsibilities for ageing parents . They might also have teenagers , which can be one of the most challenging ( and stressful ) age groups to parent . By midlife , women may have gained more seniority in the workplace . This seniority , when coupled with our tendency to over-give to colleagues at work , causes additional stress . Add menopause to the mix , and it 's easy to understand why women 's well-being reaches an all-time low point at midlife -- at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of the menopause transition ( MT ) is usually persistent changes in the menstrual cycle , caused by underlying changes in estrogen levels . According to research , estrogen changes during menopause can increase the risk of depression for some women . Volatile estrogen levels also contribute to hot flushes , which are also linked to depression . <p> One intriguing study we completed at the University of Melbourne showed that for a given frequency of hot flushes , women high in self-compassion found the symptoms to be less troubling . Specifically , self-compassionate women reported that hot flushes interfered less with key daily life experiences such as sleep , work , relationships and mood . In turn , this was associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms . <p> This is an important finding , because it shows that self-compassion may help women cope with their menopausal symptoms . The truth is that menopause is n't always smooth sailing , but self-compassion has the potential to help women manage the transition without feeling overwhelmed . <h> Silencing the inner critic <p> Many women might notice that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how to begin to silence their inner critic . Fortunately , self-compassion is a learnable skill -- and a great investment in well-being . Women can learn to be more self-compassionate through cultivating the three facets of mindfulness , self-kindness and common humanity . <p> Connecting with others through shared experiences is an important part of practising self-compassion . Picture : Shutterstock <p> Mindfulness involves being aware in the present moment , as opposed to being lost in day dreams . It involves a grounded and peaceful clarity of mind . Mindfulness is the first step to self-compassion , because you need to be aware of your own state of mind before you are able to respond with compassion . A great way to be mindful is to simply feel the weight of the body . During a hot flush , just feel the weight of your feet . You are literally just shifting your focus ' from heat to feet ' . <p> Self-kindness involves using kind language and emotional tone when relating towards yourself . It is the opposite of saying to yourself " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling embarrassed or angry at your body during a hot flush . Self-kindness involves meeting your own body 's fragilities with understanding , and an open heart . Even just placing your hands gently on your heart with a caring intention evokes self-kindness . <p> Possibly the strongest component in predicting well being outcomes is common humanity . This involves feeling connected to others during a moment of suffering rather than feeling stranded and alone . Think back to a moment when you suffered : did you feel isolated or connected ? All too often , suffering is associated with feelings of ' self ' or ' isolation ' . <p> Common humanity involves a less rigid sense of self , where on a deep level you acknowledge that suffering is part of the human condition . You feel connected to others through your suffering ( e.g. the suffering of a hot flush ) , rather than feeling isolated or misunderstood . When done wisely , attending support groups , seeing a psychologist or debriefing with friends can all contribute to a sense of common humanity . <p> Building on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now expanding this finding to explore how psychological resilience factors might improve other aspects of health and people 's experience of ageing .

I think one thing that was an issue for me at the time , there certainly was n't that much of a start-up scene or a tech scene in Australia , so there were n't a lot of places to get great mentoring . <p> So , I think one of the big advantages I had in moving to Silicon Valley was that you sit in a caf ? in the city and you just listen to a conversation next to you and it 's about customer acquisition costs and growth strategies and Haskell versus Rust , different programming languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and start-ups . <p> So , as a first-time entrepreneur , I found it much easier as somebody who did n't really have much of a background in running a company , easier to get mentoring . I think that a couple of things have changed since . I think the start-up scene is much more developed now than it was . It had huge success in Atlassian , which is a world class company that a lot of people in Australia who grew up with Atlassian now have the experience of working in a company that 's ultimately turned out to be very successful . Google has a very big office in Sydney . <p> So , you have a lot more people trained , and having had the experience of going on a wild tech adventure , we have more capital in Australia , there 's Square Peg Capital ... <p> Glyn Davis That 's right . <p> Anthony Goldbloom ... among others that are funding companies . Also , Kaggle was acquired by Google three months ago , so I now work at Google . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some point in the future I do another company , I actually think there are advantages in doing it from Australia . One advantage is their war for talent is probably not quite as acute , the cost of talent is probably not quite as high and so I think coming back to Australia as an experienced entrepreneur potentially down the track , I actually think there are some advantages to operating out of Australia . <p> Glyn Davis Indeed . So , given your emphasis on how important the ecosystem is to have experienced entrepreneurs like you back in the system is going to be very important for the future . How far were you in your journey when you made the decision to move to the United States ? <p> Anthony I started working on Kaggle initially actually nights while I was working at the Reserve Bank . That was in , let 's say , early 2009 . I think I calculated that at the rate I was going , I 'd probably finish Kaggle in about 2040 , which has taken too long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was building the website . I left the job in RBA in July . I initially did a really nice routes trip with my grandparents after that . There was a month of not really focusing on Kaggle . <p> I came back and I proposed to my wife just so I could lock in an income source . Then , coded up Kaggle , got it launched in April of 2014 , actually just after our wedding . Then started spending time in America , probably a year after launching Kaggle . So Kaggle was going well enough that there were some signs of life , it had some potential . I started by going to the US as a tourist to speak at conferences , quote-unquote , tourist , close business deals . We recruited somebody in America and then moved to the US full-time about January 2012 . <p> I would also say that moving to the US was the time when Kaggle switched from being a side-project that I thought could be a nice lifestyle business to something that I really thought had the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . <p> Glyn Davis You were there on the cusp of an important developing industry . How big is business analytics and predictive modelling today as an industry ? <p> Anthony The market for predictive analytics , business modelling and machine learning is $41 billion market . But what 's hidden inside that number is - and it 's growing at I think around eight per cent per year . It 's a big market , it 's growing fast . But the really exciting thing that 's happening in the market at the moment is there are some major shifts which leave open a big business opportunity . <p> So , it used to be that compute was mostly done on premise and you used companies like Oracle and Teradata and companies like that to do a lot of your business analytics . There 's a big shift towards the cloud . It used to be that you used predictive modelling statistical techniques for a lot of this work , so things like literacy regression , linear regression , even just basic pivot tables and things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques , mission learning techniques , particularly gradient boosting machines and more recently deep neural networks , there 's a fabulous set of things you can do now that you could n't do five , 10 years ago . <p> So , the power of these techniques is much greater than it was . So , there 's also a business opportunity because a lot of the legacy players that I mentioned earlier are not really the world 's best at these new techniques . Companies like Kaggle and our parent company Google and others like Amazon and Microsoft are far , far , far , far stronger in these new techniques . So , we 're aggressively grabbing market share . Not just that the market is growing but the major players in this market are also changing . <p> Glyn Davis You certainly have some remarkable talent . You mentioned the data competitions . One of the famous ones for NASA , your data scientists solved a problem in a week and a half that NASA had been looking at for a decade . Does this give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Anthony Our competitions are a very efficient way to get people who are very strong with machine learning and data in contact with problems that they might not have otherwise known about but they have the ability to solve . NASA was taking a dataset of galactical images and they were trying to measure the ellipticity of galaxies very precisely . If you can measure the ellipticity of galaxies very precisely , you can use that to basically infer the dark matter distribution of the universe . It was quite a challenging problem , a problem they cared a lot about . <p> Actually , the first person to make a major breakthrough on that problem was of all things , his profession was a glaciologist which I 'd never heard of a glaciologist , but he was doing a lot of image recognition which was the branch of machine learning that was required for the NASA problem in his glaciology research . Because what he was doing was taking satellite images and looking for the edges of glaciers algorithmically . It just so happens that the techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algorithmically were a good fit for measuring the ellipticity of a galaxy . <p> I like that story because I always say he was looking from space down at Earth , from satellite images down at glaciers and the competition required him to look from the ground up . So , he just had to turn the problem on its head . It 's a nice story that one . <p> Glyn Davis Can we talk for a minute about big data and government ? I know you 're coming at it from a business perspective but one of the key users of big data is government and there 's a lot of excitement about the opportunities to think again about some public policy interventions . Can you give us some sense of how your company and others have been working with government ? <p> Anthony We do a bit with government , actually working with NOAA at the moment . NOAA , the acronym is National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration . This is one of the big government departments in the US . They 're really responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US 's equivalent of the Bureau of Meteorology and they 're also responsible for policing fisheries . <p> One of the key tasks they have to do in policing fisheries is keeping track of how many of different types of - they care about conservation - so how many different types of species exist ? That can be a very tedious manual count . We 're working with them at the moment to take aerial photographs - I think they were taken in Alaska , I forget exactly where -. and building algorithms that automatically count the number of sealions based on those aerial photographs . So , just taking something that some people used to do manually and automating it . <p> We recently did a fascinating project with the Nature Conservancy . Fishing is not well monitored at all . It 's extremely expensive to send out somebody on a fishing boat to make sure that there is n't illegal fishing happening . Actually , it 's quite a dangerous job because fishing boats are often not the - they 're quite rough places . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the idea was with the Nature Conservancy we tackled this problem where you put a camera on a fishing boat and you automatically count and classify the fish that are being caught . Are they going above their quota , or are they catching by-catch of species that they should n't be catching ? I guess I 'm thinking about oceans at the moment which is why I came up with these two examples . But they 're examples of things that public policy had a hard time dealing with historically that these new machine learning techniques are able to help us address . <p> Glyn Davis A lot of policy work by government relies on sampling techniques such as household surveys to gain insights into the population . You 're describing quite a different and automated approach to that . Are governments perhaps using old tools in a new setting ? <p> Anthony Yeah , I wish I could remember where this research was . But there was research done out of one of the US universities replacing the census with other data sources , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting people or cars or houses . <p> So , there are a lot of amazing data sources that did n't exist in 1783 or whenever the US Constitution said that we have to have a census every 10 years . So , there are definitely ways to reboot the census for the big data world . Just more generally , I think it 's a great opportunity for the Australian Bureau of Statistics , it 's a great opportunity for the various statistical bureaus in the US to look at having a less people-intensive approach to gathering statistics and having those statistics be released on more of a real-time basis . <p> There is a huge opportunity that is probably not really being taken at the moment to reboot the way that national statistics are done . <p> Glyn Davis People are talking very excitedly about perhaps addressing wicked problems using big data , so some of the most challenging issues around the planet , obesity and climate change for example . Is there a role for data in working through these sorts of choices and helping inform policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these cases , not so much climate change , but perhaps health related issues like obesity . Some of the more classical techniques may be more useful so randomised control trials are an incredibly effective tool for public policy studies . I 'm not sure that machine learning techniques have much to add above and beyond randomised control trials . <p> So , there may be ways that machine learning could help at the edges , but I think that making good use of randomised control trials is going to be more powerful for a lot of public health issues . <p> Glyn Davis Moving from policy to politics , data source from voters is clearly becoming an important player in campaigns . Sometimes , in interesting policy ways , the Pirate Party in Iceland for example , has been a leader in this and Lab Hacker and E-Democracy are two programs that encourage people to make proposals to representatives , work through them to improve bills and policies . But there is also an interesting engagement by data in election campaigns . What 's been the discussion between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , it 's interesting . I think the Obama campaign in particular did a good job of using data science machine learning techniques to do things like micro-targeting voters . You have a certain number of people who are willing to knock on doors for you and you do n't want to send them to doors where they 're definitely not going to vote for your party or they 're definitely going to vote for your party but rather , so in the Obama case , I do n't want to vote for diehard Republicans nor diehard Democrats . What they want to do is they want to find the people who are swing voters and spend the energy knocking on those doors . <p> Actually , the second Obama campaign in particular had a huge number of people from Silicon Valley volunteer and actually quite a few companies came out of that campaign that have gone on to be very successful . So , some of the technology they developed for that campaign they 've gone on to make companies out of . There 's a company called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Civis Analytics , the founder was the Chief Analytics Officer for the Obama campaign . <p> Actually , interestingly , I would say this current campaign , turn that on its head , a lot of the same people who contributed to the Obama campaign were also contributing to the Clinton campaign . But it 's interesting , because I think the Trump campaign was quite a lot less sophisticated . As I understand it , they did have some efforts in this regard but it was not nearly as sophisticated an effort . I think Trump ran a very different campaign and won that with all the sophistication of the Clinton statistical machine . The Trump campaign showed that there are other approaches that can be effective in winning . <p> Glyn Davis Certainly , winning the electoral college vote . It 's very interesting you say that because of course on the Trump side , there are companies involved , people involved who are very proud of , as they perceive it , the role of data in helping Donald Trump become President . Cambridge Analytica is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short clip from Alexander Nix who is the CEO of Cambridge Analytica speaking at a presentation in September 2016 , so just weeks before the Presidential election . <p> Alexander Nix Communication is fundamentally changing . Back in the days of mad men , communication was essentially top down , that is it 's creative-led . Brilliant minds get together and come up with slogans like Beanz Means Heinz and Coca Cola Is It . They push these messages onto the audience in the hope that they resonate . <p> Today , we do n't need to guess at what creative solution may or may not work . We can use hundreds or thousands of individual data points on our targeted audiences to understand exactly which messages are going to appeal to which audiences way before the creative process starts . <p> Glyn Davis Can you say something about psychographic profiling which is where Cambridge Analytica made its name ? <p> Anthony The ultimate goal for a lot of these efforts is , as I said , micro-targeting . What they will often do is they will buy data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from really whatever they can get hold of . So , they might be able to buy data on your magazine subscriptions , they may be able to buy data on what kind of car you drive , they might be able to buy data on all sorts of things . So , once they have assembled a large data set they can find some interesting relationships that might help them determine your political leaning . <p> So , for instance , if you have a big heavy four-wheel drive SUV as it 's called in America , that might point in the direction of you being a Republican voter . But then if you also have four kids , that might steer you a little bit towards you being a Democrat voter , and the more of these what you call signals that can be assembled , the better the microtargeting is at pinning down your likely political persuasions , <p> As I said , the ultimate is to pick people who are on the fence . A well landed message can swing them in one direction or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to connect people and then move them to action . Donald Trump 's chief strategist , Steve Bannon , sat on the board of Cambridge Analytica and one of its key backers Robert Mercer was a major donor to the US President . Obviously , this is a very sophisticated use of data , but is there something sinister we should fear in this development ? <p> Anthony Yeah , I would say the area where big data gets a little bit murky is when data is being sold without your knowledge . So , companies like Google I think are very transparent . You can see what data they have about you and have some visibility into how it 's used . There are a lot of data brokers out there who will - are collecting data about you and will sell it without your knowledge . So , your data sets about you can end up in the hands of whether it be political campaigns or places where you might be surprised how much they know about you , to the extent that there are sinister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of what is happening with your data that you 're not aware of . <p> Glyn Davis Indeed , the interaction between data and security services is very patent . One of the revelations from Edward Snowden is just the level of information that was held by security services . So , is n't privacy - you 've just touched on the fundamental issue , when you considered how connected the world is and how we as citizens ca n't know what the full range of data that 's being collected on us . <p> Glyn Davis I think some companies handle it better than others . As I said , I think Google is really an exemplar here . Yes , they collect a lot of data , but you have the ability to interrogate the data that is collected on you . So , I think the areas where there really is a breach of trust or breach of privacy is when things are being done with your data that you have no knowledge of . <p> Glyn Davis How good is government at understanding the implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so extraordinarily quickly ? <p> Anthony It 's actually a big challenge . So , the way I 've heard it described which I quite like is tech companies , Silicon Valley , iterates on a three-month cycle , traditional businesses iterate on a five-year cycle and government iterates on 100-year cycle . It 's very difficult . Government is trying to regulate in a world where they 're not able to attract the best talent , who really understands how data science machine learning , a lot of these new technologies work . <p> So , in a lot of cases , you 're finding regulation is slow to update . When it does update , it ends up updating in ways that are not necessarily in anybody 's best interests . We 're in a world that is probably changing faster , arguably changing faster than it 's ever changed before . A lot of the most talented people are not finding government a particularly attractive place to go and it makes it hard for governments to keep up . <p> Glyn Davis I 'd just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting question around privacy as well , big data is being used by police forces to anticipate trends . In California , where you are , predictive policing has seen robberies decline by a quarter following use of the PredPol policing software . <p> Anthony , this certainly show the power of big data , but is there a risk of targeting certain social-economic groups ? <p> Anthony Yeah , one big hot topic in data science , especially in learning circles at the moment , is bias in algorithms and how do you build algorithms that are not biased ? This actually also happens to be a hot area of academic research . It 's a really tough one . If you feed in biased data into an algorithm , the algorithm will continue to have a bias . So , the only real solution to this is having balanced unbiased data sets . Data science machine learning is not magic . It is only as good as the data you feed it . <p> Glyn Davis Revenues in big data business analytics are expected to grow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more by 2020 . I know it 's hard to predict the future . Where do you see the big data industry heading ? <p> Anthony Goldbloom Kaggle has a million users today . I 'd like to see us be 10 times that , 100 times that in the coming years . So , actually universities like the University of Melbourne have a huge role to play here . There is a massive shortage of data scientists and machine learners and it 's a very rewarding profession , at the moment a very lucrative profession . So , I think for data science machine learning to reach its potential to drive a large number of the decisions that each of us make every day or that companies make every day , we need to solve this talent shortage . <p> If we do solve this talent shortage , we will start to see algorithms starting to help make business decisions more frequently and more precisely than we can do as humans , which does obviously open up a scary question . If algorithms are capable of doing things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealions from an aerial survey , there 's a question around jobs and what would people do when a lot of the jobs that we currently do are taken over by algorithms . <p> That is genuinely something that I think a lot about and worry a lot about and I do n't know , given the pace of innovation , historically when we face big waves of innovation , humans have been able to retrain and we 're very flexible and do things that technology ca n't do . <p> The one potential difference here is that the change is coming so quickly , do we have enough time to retrain ? This is not like the industrial revolution which took decades and decades and decades to unfold but rather it 's happening . The progress , you can measure in years , not in decades . There is certainly a scary dimension to the rise in machine learning and artificial intelligence . <p> Glyn Davis Anthony , as we 're talking about industry , one of the arguments that 's beginning to emerge in the academic and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a handful of tech companies dominating an industry , and others finding it very difficult to come in , and that has raised questions about whether the anti-trust responses of the early twentieth century will need to be thought about in terms of technology . How do you respond to that emerging discussion ? <p> Anthony Yeah , I think that tech industry is quite different to the oil and gas industry for instance . Technology tends to create natural monopolies but those natural monopolies do n't tend to last for very long . The last generation of great tech companies were the Oracles and the SAPs . This generation it 's Google , Amazon , Facebook , Microsoft . The next generation may be a company that has n't even been founded yet . <p> So , there is so much change in the technology industry that you 're a king for a while but you 're only a king until the next big wave of technology comes . <p> So , I think that policy and antitrust has much less concern today that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the industry will mean that the current giants end up being disrupted without antitrust having to intervene . <p> Glyn Davis You mentioned the challenges for the public service and public sector in understanding what data makes possible . What sort of training and upskill is going to be necessary in order to make sure both sides of the equation know what they 're doing ? <p> Anthony Goldbloom One problem that the public sector has is it really operates as an environment that is not super-conducive to the kinds of people who - the kinds of people who do well in the tech industry are not necessarily the same kinds of people who are going to be attracted to a role in the public service . People who tend to do well in the tech industry are restless and they want to be constantly changing things . Government , as I said , tends to change quite slowly . <p> There are some bright spots . There 's the US digital service which is a very fast moving part of the US government that helps implement the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , looking at things like the US digital service it 's a nice example for other governments to follow . <p> Glyn Davis Finally , you mentioned the possibility , very welcome , that you and others might use Australia in the future as a base for start-ups . But what would need to change here to make Australia a very attractive place for companies such as yours ? <p> Anthony Yeah , it 's a good question . I think a lot has changed in Australia anyway . For somebody like me , it 's attractive to come back to Australia because we have great universities , we turn out great computer science students and they do n't have the job opportunities necessarily that they would have if they were at a Stanford or a Berkeley . <p> For me personally , it 's attractive to work on a company out of Australia because you have access to that talent without having to compete with the Googles and the Facebooks . I think for somebody who was like me six or seven years ago and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies and get a bit of a - get the mentoring you need , it 's really important . The only way to get that is to have other successful companies grow up in Australia and I think that is starting to happen . You have the Atlassians of the world , as I said . So , that ecosystem is already naturally building . <p> Glyn Davis Anthony , it 's been great talking with an Australian graduate who 's providing leadership in such a fascinating and demanding industry , and thank you for encouraging today 's students to think about maths and computer science and machine learning as really important areas . <p> Anthony Goldbloom , founder and CEO of Kaggle , thank you for taking the time to talk to us . <p> Anthony Goldbloom Nice to make the connection .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> The human fingerprint on Europe 's recent heat <p> The June 2017 European heatwave was likely caused by human influence on the climate <p> By Dr Andrew King , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> This June , Europe experienced some remarkable heat . Temperature records were smashed across the west of the continent with extremely hot days followed by warm uncomfortable nights for many . <p> While the heat was fun for some , it took its toll on others , contributing to the Portuguese wildfires , which killed at least 64 people . Undoubtedly the heat will have caused many more deaths across the continent through heat stroke and pre-existing conditions exacerbated by the hot weather . <p> Previous research has found that excess deaths during recent European heatwaves can be attributed to the human influence on the climate . These extreme heat events are becoming more common in Europe and around the world . In order to be prepared for future severe heatwaves we need to understand how and why they are changing . <p> Figure : Western and central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Climate Central <h> Did climate change play a part ? <p> Our World Weather Attribution group , coordinated by Climate Central and including researchers from Australia , France , the Netherlands , Switzerland , the UK and the US , performed a multi-method study of the event . This rapid analysis examined how the likelihood of hot June temperatures has changed , and assessed the role of human-caused climate change in the hot temperatures across Europe . You can find full details of the analysis here . <p> First we examined the observational series of temperatures for each of the seven regions of Western Europe we studied : Belgium , central England , France , central Netherlands , Portugal , Spain and Switzerland . June 2017 was unusually warm for all these areas , with new records for the month set in Portugal , Spain and central Netherlands . In all the regions we studied , the hot temperatures were unusual even in the current climate . <p> When we use statistical methods to compare the world of 2017 with that of 1900 we see large increases in the likelihood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average daytime temperatures over Portugal in June were at least 150 times more likely than they would have been over a century ago . <p> To explicitly investigate the role of climate change in this heat we have to use climate models with and without human influences and study the changes in hot June temperatures . <p> We used four different sets of climate model simulations to do this analysis including global models and regional model simulations only covering Europe . Based on each of these model experiments we can clearly see that human-caused climate change has increased the likelihood of hot June temperatures . This is the case even when we look at very small regions , like central England and central Netherlands , where the climate is more variable making it harder to find a climate change signal . <p> We can be confident that human influence on the climate significantly increased the likelihood of this extreme heat event occurring . <h> What can we expect in future ? <p> Whether these extreme heat events become the " new normal " in future largely depends on whether we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business as usual scenario , where we continue to increase our greenhouse gas emissions , we find that , in Europe , extreme heat events like June 2017 would be close to average by the end of this century . <p> Figure : June temperatures like 2017 are projected to become more frequent in future . For Portugal and Spain both the June mean temperature ( T ) and the June average daytime maximum temperature ( TX ) were analysed . Source : Author provided . <p> On the other hand , if we stick to the Paris targets of limiting global warming to 1.5 ? C or 2 ? C then we can prevent these heat events becoming too common . <p> For example , at 1.5 ? C of global warming we would expect very hot June temperatures in Portugal like this year 's to occur in about one in every four years while at 2 ? C of global warming such heat would occur in about one in every three years on average . <p> Given the impacts of extreme heat , there is clearly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agreement . If we let global warming continue unabated then the extreme heat of June 2017 will become the new normal and we either have to University 's Privacy Officer at **30;611;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> Embracing the finite <p> VOICEOVER This is Up Close , the research talk show from the University of Melbourne , Australia . <p> ANDI HORVATH I 'm Dr Andi Horvath , thanks for joining us . Over its 4.5 billion years of life , our planet has been a dynamic and evolving place , with asteroid impacts , volcanoes , shifts in climate like ice ages . We know that life first began on Earth some 3.8 billion years ago , but our species , Homo sapiens , has only been here perhaps 300,000 years . While humans began to make their mark on the planet with hunting and early farming , it was n't until quite recent times with the spread of large-scale agriculture , industrialisation and global trade that human impact on the world 's environment has become a key driver of planetary health . <p> We live in what is referred to as the Anthropocene , a geological epoch where our species shapes the Earth 's systems , instead of the other way around . We 've altered or polluted our air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've altered the biodiversity of plants and animals in the sea and on land , leading to extinctions , invasions and imbalances . The Anthropocene has brought disrupted ecosystems and is endangering our own resources and the health and livelihood of future generations . There are many challenges ahead . <p> But this is n't the first time human societies have had to act more sustainably with limited resources or nutrients needed for survival . Islands in the Pacific are microcosms of limited resources , and the way some human groups have survived or thrived there may provide a clue to how to get by in an ecologically uncertain future . <p> Our guest today is biologist Peter Vitousek . He has for many years researched and been inspired by the generational cultural practices of agriculture found in the varied islands of Polynesia , and armed with knowledge from history and science , he 's seen what 's worked and what has n't . Peter Vitousek is Clifford G. Morrison Professor in Population &amp; Resource Studies at Stanford University and Senior Fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career in ecology and has been named by Time Magazine and CNN as one of America 's top scientists . Peter , welcome . <p> PETER Thank you . <p> ANDI HORVATH Peter , tell us about the term Anthropocene . <p> PETER Anthropocene is really a way of expressing the fact that humans are a large influence on the planet . We 've named other geological epochs after what controlled them , and humans are clearly a geological force on the planet now , and so it makes reasonable sense to speak of the Anthropocene . <p> ANDI HORVATH When did we first start making that impact ? <p> PETER That 's a really good question . We 've had an impact for a long time . When did the impact become pervasive enough to really label it as something different ? Probably the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century , maybe more recently than that , but it 's an extremely recent phenomenon . <p> ANDI HORVATH Now , some of the impact of humans has been irreversible , like extinctions like bird species . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes we make are pervasive and global , but not irreversible . The changes we 've made in the atmosphere are the sorts of things that are really important , but if our species were to go away , which is unfortunately not impossible , those changes would reverse themselves in only a few hundred years , long by the scale of a human life but not long in terms of the life of the planet . However , there are things like the extinction of a unique species that are completely irreversible . There is nothing that will bring back a species once it is extinct , and it may take a long time for the functions it played to come back in new forms . <p> ANDI HORVATH Give us a perspective of how different the Anthropocene is to , say , Jurassic times . <p> PETER Well , the biggest change in the Anthropocene is the influence of a single species . The influence of us is pervasive over the Earth , and no singles species played a role like that at any time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far . We do n't know if it is going to expand and the human influence is going to become clearer , if we 're going to get smart and minimise our influence , or if we 're going to go away and our influence will also gradually then disappear . But it 's strong now . <p> ANDI HORVATH Peter , take us through some of the key drivers of human activity on Earth 's systems . Where shall we start ? <p> PETER Well , if we wanted to really start at the beginning , the most important ultimate driver is our population , the fact that our population has expanded enormously , especially since about 1800 . Even in the time since then , it 's really remarkable . When I first became aware that there was a global human population , I was an elementary school system , there were perhaps 2 billion people on the world as a whole . There are now almost 7.5 billion . <p> That of course is a fundamental change , because we all want to live well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means we consume resources to make that happen , and the fact that we consume those resources , the fact that we 're such a large influence , means that even our waste products loom large on a global scale . We are n't mostly deliberately changing the world . We 're accidentally changing the world as a by-product of our activities . <p> ANDI HORVATH But we 've become more cognizant of things like land clearing and intensive agriculture . Are we starting to make inroads there that are not going to permanently damage soils ? <p> PETER We 're certainly making inroads . There 's no question that in many of the things that we pay attention to , things were worse in the past , and through our focused effort to make them better , often through technology but not always through technology , we 've managed to greatly reduce the impact per person or the impact per unit of economic activity in many aspects of how the world works . Is that enough ? Well , it would have been enough when we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the driver of what you call biotic additions and losses , the changes in balances between plants and animals in various land spaces , say , like , introducing cane toads from Hawaii to Australia . Hunting , peak fishing , those sorts of things , is there a tipping point that we 've reached ? <p> PETER Well , we 'd always like to know where tipping points are . They tend to reveal themselves in retrospect better than they do in prospect , as we know , and it 's hard to know even when they 're going on , but we are making massive changes in the biological diversity of Earth . And it is something that is irreversible . Once you lose species , or once you move a new species to a new place , that 's a very difficult thing to reverse , as I know you 've seen in Australia many times , as we 've seen in Hawaii also . And the losses are really substantial . <p> Of course , extinction of species is a natural process . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which species are becoming extinct has gone up many-fold , and lots of estimates converge on about 100-fold in the past century through intensive human activity , mostly through land clearing . But it 'll be increasingly through climate change and other sorts of influences people have , through introduction of species to new environments , even though hunting and through overfishing , as we 're really effective predators . We 're really effective fishers , and so we tend to knock out the things that we focus on over time . <p> ANDI HORVATH Tell me about the invisible parts of our planet , things like nitrogen , carbon and also synthetic molecules that we 're putting into our system . There 's a lot of pollution going on as well . Now , these are invisible to us as humans on a daily basis , but these are having a huge impact . <p> PETER They are , but we think in terms of the elements like carbon and nitrogen as of the great biogeochemical cycles of Earth that underlie all of life . And the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere substantially . We ca n't taste or smell that . We ca n't see that , but it is changing the climate . It is changing the growth and chemistry of plants , and that influence is globally pervasive . <p> Also , the oceans , their acidity is controlled by the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in them . As carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases , carbon dioxide in the surface ocean also increases , and it becomes more acidic , and that has an influence on corals and any other organism that builds its structure out of molecules that ultimately derive from carbon dioxide . <p> Nitrogen , too , is something that we use in fertiliser . We use it because adding nitrogen to agricultural fields is essential to their sustainable production . We have to do it if we 're going to maintain highly productive agriculture , but it transforms the global cycle of nitrogen . Unequivocally increases various estimates of the amount of increase in the amount of active nitrogen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's an extraordinarily pervasive change that changes the way the world works . <p> When I think of the Anthropocene in these terms , I do n't focus so much on the fact that it 's all bad . What I focus on is the fact that it 's all changed , and it 's unequivocally all changed , and we can see that and show that very clearly , especially in alterations in the biogeochemical cycles , ultimately in changes in climate as well . From our human perspective , those changes bring winners and losers . From biological perspectives , they bring winners and losers , too . If you 're a cockroach , humans are the best thing that ever happened to you , right ? There 's no question about that . It 's not a matter of everything being bad for everyone . It 's a matter of everything 's changed , and that 's what the Anthropocene is . <p> ANDI HORVATH So if we do n't take stock of sustainability , this is going to be good for cockroaches but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true , yeah . With the power to change the world comes responsibility for doing that right . If we do n't pay very serious attention to trying to mitigate the consequences of what we do , if we do n't take that responsibility , then I think it will be very bad for us . <p> ANDI HORVATH So then do we maintain the function of the ecosystems and sustain life as they are now ? Is now an ideal condition , although it 's changed ? <p> PETER I think that there 's no real chance of maintaining things in an unchanged state . I think that the important thing is to design , to do the best we can under what will undoubtedly be changing circumstances , recognising that there are some things of importance and beauty that will be lost in the process , but that through our actions we can keep much that 's important and beautiful in the world . And if we do that , we 'll have done the best we can . We ca n't ask for more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking about the Anthropocene with Peter here on Up Close . Peter , what can we learn from the history of some of the Pacific Islands , which I know you 've been looking at . They 're microcosms of limited resources . <p> PETER They 're microcosms of worlds is how I look at it , really . When people reach some of the more isolated Pacific islands , they were on their own and their island was their world , and so they really faced a global system in a way that we 're only now beginning to . They had the advantage , which we have now too , but most humans have not had , but they had the advantage of their world was finite . They could see what was going on . They could see that they were changing things . They could see that what was left was all there was . There was n't a horizon . They could n't just go somewhere else and take care of things or take something from someone else , somewhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves that things were not as good as they 'd once been in some ways . They faced the challenge of making a transition to living sustainably , much as we do now . And I think the important thing is that the fact that they were worlds , that they faced what we think of as global change on a much smaller scale , much earlier than we did . <p> ANDI HORVATH Now , you have studied some of these islands . Tell us about Hawaiian agricultural practices pre-European contact . What did they eat and how did they farm ? <p> PETER Yeah . Well , the Hawaiians - Polynesians generally , but the Hawaiians especially , even among Polynesians , were superb farmers . They intensified agriculture by multiple pathways . By intensified , I mean used the same ground over and over , put a lot of inputs of irrigation and other kinds of management in and got very high yields , very high population densities , very highly structured societies as a result . <p> Of course , the very highly structured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chicken and egg situation . You need to be organised to do intensive agriculture . You need intensive agriculture to be organised , and so the two evolved together in Hawaiian history . But they were great . They were highly productive . My analysis of Hawaiian agriculture wo n't mean a lot to people who have n't had experience in Hawaii , but except for the city of Honolulu , the island where the city of Honolulu is located , there were probably more people when Hawaii was on its own , before the world came crashing in , than there are now , on all of the islands except for Oahu , where Honolulu is located . So completely from local resources , using only local resources , they 'd maintained a greater population than is there now and had done so in a sustained way for a couple of centuries , at least , before the world came crashing in . So they 'd figured some interesting things out . <p> ANDI HORVATH What did they figure out , did they ... <p> PETER Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how they did it , because so much of the world did n't do that , and even our systems now are more productive . Our intensive agriculture is beautifully done , but we do n't know if it 's going to last 200 years , and theirs did . So I do n't know that theirs was sustainable in the sense that it could have gone on forever . I do n't know that ours is , but I do know that theirs was sustained for a long time . <p> ANDI HORVATH So what are the lessons learned in observing how they did agriculture ? Obviously , they did n't have scientists , but we now know that they had a good system of nitrogen cycling . Tell us about that . <p> PETER Well , they were n't scientists . That social role did n't exist . They practiced science . They experimented . They did observations . They saw what worked , and they followed up on it , and they spent time on crop breeding and developed new varieties of their main crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANDI HORVATH So they explored by planting , say , taro in areas where there was nice volcanic runoff or something of nutrients . <p> PETER They would have done that . They would have also , as many people in the tropics did , practiced shifting cultivation , slash-and-burn agriculture , where they would clear an area of land , burn it , plant their crops , probably sweet potato in the uplands , then after two , three or four crops , let it go back to forest , and then come back maybe 20 years later and repeat the process . That 's a sustainable system as long as you let the forest stay there long enough between clearing , but it 's never going to be a very efficient system , because you 're only using a small fraction of the land for crops in any year . I 'm sure that they practiced that system and experimented with it and found they could extend the cropping period in some places and were eventually able to farm most of the land that they farmed most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for many generations . <p> PETER Had to have . <p> ANDI HORVATH What happened ? Europeans arrived . <p> PETER Europeans arrived , brought the world 's diseases in . Probably 90 percent of Hawaiians died from those diseases , and the agricultural system , which depended on a highly structured society and substantial population to work the land , collapsed , as 90 percent of the people died . <p> ANDI HORVATH Do we see examples of this type of clever strategy in New Zealand ? And there are a couple other case studies you 've studied , too . <p> PETER We see Polynesians were very good agriculturalists , but of course , what they could do was constrained by the land that they found . And so if you look at the islands of Polynesia , some of them are small and do n't have much in the way of terrestrial resources . Some are big and relatively rich . Aotearoa-New Zealand is interesting because it 's temperate , and on South Island , most of the crops the Polynesians carried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Island , so they had to evolve ways of living that did n't involve agriculture . And so they evolved from agricultural people into non-agricultural people . In Hawaii , they evolved from agricultural people who had an idea of how to do irrigated taro into people who did some upland things with sweet potato in particular that were globally unique . <p> ANDI HORVATH So would it be fair to say there are common factors that the land influenced development of culture on the islands ? <p> PETER Yes , absolutely . Vice versa too , of course . The Anthropocene came early there . Those people were shaping their lands , but the lands were also shaping the societies . <p> ANDI HORVATH I 'm Andi Horvath . We 're talking about the social and natural history of some of the Pacific islands and what they may teach us about living sustainably with limited resources , with biologist Peter Vitousek , here on Up Close . Now , Peter , not all of these island stories are success stories . Tell us about Rapanui or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what makes it interesting in a lot of ways , in that these societies did face the challenge of intensifying agricultural production and supporting a complex society , and most of them did . They then faced the challenge that when you practice intensive agriculture , you degrade the resource base which your intensive agriculture is based on , so they faced the challenge of making a transition to living more sustainably . <p> Some of them did a beautiful job , but not all of them . Now , there are stories about societies collapsing before European contact . Looking at Rapanui or Easter Island in particular , what my colleagues and I see is a really constrained society , one that did n't have the potential for intensifying agriculture that a place like Hawaii did , that did make the transition to an intensive production system but was n't able to keep it going , and so the term I like to use is regressed from their peak of production , social organisation and probably population before Europeans arrived . <p> Then Europeans arrived , and the society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to South America to work in mines . That was the true collapse on Rapanui , but I think things probably got worse in much of Rapanui than they had been at one time before Europeans arrived , but they certainly did not - maybe were not able to , but for whatever reason did not , make a transition to living more sustainably on that land . <p> ANDI HORVATH So , Peter , some of these islanders might have moved around quite a bit . There would have been some migration or drift over time . Did this pose challenges or perhaps even advantages ? <p> PETER I 'm sure there were opportunities that came from it . If you have people coming from another island where they 've figured something out , they would bring that information and say there 's a way . We can do this . Some of the Pacific islands - Tikopia is the one that is best recognised for this - clearly made an active choice to live more sustainably , redesigned its agricultural production system completely , regulated its population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 years . Now , that sort of static sustainability is a very unusual thing in human history , but one can not doubt that it was an interesting thing for a society to have chosen , and not common at all . <p> ANDI HORVATH When you talk about the regulation of societies for these islands for sustainability , what exactly do you mean ? <p> PETER Well , what we know in the case of Tikopia was that they changed the agricultural system to be more sustainable . They also developed an ethic of population regulation to the point that that is carried in the controlling chant of the island . Each of the cultural groups has a chance that expresses the nature of this land and society , and the one there includes the idea that every man and woman should have a son and daughter and no more . It also includes the notion that the chiefs should gather the people - it 's a small island - every year and decide how many young should be born in the coming year . So there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the contraceptive technology they had , it 's not something our society would recognise necessarily as a very humane system , but in a lot of ways , sustainability is n't always pretty . It does involve loss . It does involve forgoing things , and they made an explicit choice to keep their population at a level , which they 've actually sustained into the present . There was no doubt infanticide , and I understand also if the population got too high for resources , if you had hurricanes or bad years , there would be forced voyaging . People would be forced to get in canoes and leave the island , which probably most of them did n't survive . <p> ANDI HORVATH I wonder how they got voted off the island . <p> PETER Well , the chief I 'm sure decided . Sustainability has a price . There 's no question about that , but the price of a society losing its social organisation is also a horrendous price . <p> ANDI HORVATH So , Peter , how do we know what went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the evidence ? How did you find information about them ? <p> PETER Well , there are lots of lines of evidence . First and foremost , the culture is alive , and it 's carried its stories . Those are accessible and understandable . Second , these were intensive agriculturalists , so they changed the face of the land , just as we have , and where they have n't been overwritten by later human modifications , the evidence of those modifications is still clear in the land . That 's what archaeology does . So the combination of archaeology and cultural understanding that has carried through from Hawaiian cultures to the present is really a pretty rich and powerful body of information that tells us about practice in the past . <p> ANDI HORVATH Let 's widen this out . Can we use this information to understand pathways to sustainability in a more global sense now ? <p> PETER That 's the interesting challenge . That 's in a lot of ways why we do the work , trying to see if there 's some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that we 're not likely to learn much about practices that will help us . They had a very constrained toolkit of technology and crops , and we have a broader one . As a global society now , we have more options in front of us . But there had to have been some extremely important ways of thinking that went into the transition , ways of social organisation that either fostered or stood in the way of making an active choice for living sustainably , and those are the things that I think we need to understand . Unfortunately , you wo n't see them by studying the remains of agricultural systems . You have to learn what you can of the society . <p> There 's one thing that 's interesting when you think about us as compared to those Pacific island societies . What was unique about them is that they were worlds , and as societies occupying isolated worlds , they were able to see the whole world , and they were able to see what was changing . And they were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've never been in that position before , but we are now . We have satellites that allow us to see the world repeatedly and with a pretty high resolution . We have sensors that tell us how the atmosphere is changing globally , and so we can unequivocally see how we are changing our world , and we also have pictures back from the moon that make it absolutely clear that Earth is an island . So we 're in the same place they were , and they did n't all succeed , but we have that choice now . <p> ANDI HORVATH It seems to me that we all have to cooperate globally on this one , which worries me . <p> PETER Yeah . <p> ANDI HORVATH What happens if some nations wo n't work or play with us ? <p> PETER Well , I think we have the advantage that in the long run , it 's in people 's interest to collaborate . And so some very bad things can happen in the short run , but should we manage our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic disease , then I think the fact that it 's in our long-run interest will bring us together , undoubtedly with blips because we 're humans and we do stupid things politically and socially , and much will be lost because we did n't take a straight-line path , but I am confident that we will . Because it 's in our interest to do so , we will collaborate in the long run . <p> ANDI HORVATH We 've been speaking about sustainability and what we can learn from the social and natural history of Pacific islands with biologist Peter Vitousek , who is Clifford G.

 <h> Pursuit home <h> The unexpected gift of bones <p> A collection of leg bones at the Melbourne Dental School was originally intended to play a key role in forensic medicine , but unexpected discoveries along the way have opened up whole new areas of research from bone strength to ageing <p> By Michelle Moo , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> The most durable bone in the body is the mid-shaft of the femur , or thighbone . <p> In nature , when bodies are left unburied , the elements eventually expose the bones and they begin to break down . Scavenging animals may speed up the process , rapidly destroying much of the skeleton . But in both cases , it 's the middle of the thighbone -- which is very thick - that most often survives and can be analysed . <p> The femur is the longest , heaviest and strongest bone in the human body . Picture : iStock <p> While the connection between leg bones and dentistry is not immediately obvious , the femur 's attributes are the reason the Melbourne Dental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a collection attracting the attention of researchers from medical science to anthropology internationally , but with origins in forensic dentistry , or forensic odontology . <h> The mystery of age-at-death <p> Forensic dentistry deals with teeth , and the marks left by teeth , to infer the history of a person . It is an expertise many of us have seen dramatised on TV when dental records prove central to the identification of a victim , or one bite mark solves a murder . But there are other critical applications of forensic odontology , such as in the aftermath of natural disasters or war and rapid and effective identification is critical for both families of victims and legal redress . It is also critical in anthropology and archaeology in helping reconstruct our deep past . <p> In 1989 , forensic odontologist Professor John Clement , founder of the Melbourne Femur Collection , arrived at the University of Melbourne . <p> When faced with one of the central problems in forensics -- establishing the age at death of human remains -- Professor Clement , now the Melbourne Dental School 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the femur . <p> At the time , the sequential emergence of teeth until adulthood could be reliably used to establish the age-at-death of younger human remains . But once all the adult teeth have come in there was n't a way of confirming age-at-death through teeth alone . <p> The femur , with its thick cortex -- the outer layer of the bone -- was the perfect candidate . As we age our bones start to thin and there are changes in their microstructures . It seemed that science might be able to tell the age at time of death by examining the cortex . Presumably , in younger bones the cortex would be thicker and denser and in older ones , thinner and more porous . <p> The story however proved to be much more complicated . <h> The early research <p> During this early research to determine age-related changes to bone , the Melbourne Femur Collection emerged . Professor Clement and his team worked with the strong support of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine ( VIFM ) and , with the generosity and trust of donor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They knew exactly where the bones had come from . They had been screened for diseases that might affect structure , and had come from a fairly narrow population . Factors such as poor nutrition were unlikely to skew results , and importantly , age at time of death was known . <p> In knowing age-at-death , researchers would be able to test whether there was a standard range in the structure and density of bone within each age group . <p> The results were emphatic . Across each age group there was an enormous variation in the thickness , density and microstructures of the cortex . There was no way the cortex could be used to reliably determine an individual 's age . <p> It was a disappointing revelation ; and useless for forensics . <p> Femoral cortical bone cross-sections that have been . All the images are of bones from individuals between 78 - 80 years , illustrating a very wide variation in the thickness and structure of the bone across the same age group . The top row is males , and the bottom row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the road <p> But the research was getting noticed in other circles . <p> In the mid-1990s , medical research into bones relied on x-rays that could only look at the gross structure , and mineral density could only be inferred through calculations . They could n't see the important finer detail inside the bone . <p> Meanwhile the team at the Melbourne Dental School was looking into the bone at increasingly fine levels of detail , using newly emergent technologies and approaches . <p> What became particularly apparent were the methodologies that dentists were bringing to the table -- as specialists in hard tissue , or bone -- and the care with which the collection was formed , resulting in trustworthy , robust data . <p> It got the attention of specialists in bone health and osteoporosis , who immediately saw the value and applicability of the collection and the research the dental school was doing . <p> So began the cross-disciplinary possibilities . Medical researchers , anthropologists and other scientists from Cambridge to Saskatchewan got in contact with the team , resulting in numerous significant international collaborations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Beyond forensics <p> In terms of bone health , the Melbourne Femur Collection opened up a whole field of inquiry , with implications for diseases that threaten to impoverish us all as the population continues to age , such as osteoporosis . <p> The strength of bone is not just reliant on its thickness , but also its density , and its porosity . A porous bone -- essentially full of pores or holes -- is weak . For a long time it was thought that hip fractures in older people were the result of falls . Recently however , it 's emerging that a slight knock against a table may fracture a weak hip , and the fall follows . <p> In your seventies , a hip fracture doubles your risk of dying within a year . For women 80 and older who are in excellent health , it triples . <p> With an increasingly ageing population , it promises to be a huge public health issue . <p> But , as the Melbourne Femur Collection helped establish , weaknesses in the bone are not uniform , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual 's bone is dependent on critical periods , such as late adolescence , when we reach peak bone mass . <p> " If we know the optimal exercise and nutrition interventions at these critical ages , " says Professor Clement , " and target them , such as getting teenage girls to exercise on rowing machines -- the perfect weight-bearing exercise for hip strength -- we may be able to affect a generation of women , ensuring longer , higher quality lifespans . " <h> The gift of bones <p> Preventing a generation of osteoporosis may seem a long way from forensics . For the team at the Melbourne Dental School , it 's a possibility that could n't have been imagined when the collection began . <p> " It has a lot to do with serendipity , " says Melbourne Femur Collection Curator and Lecturer of Anatomy , Dr Rita Hardiman . " You do n't know what you might find . " <p> What the researchers first went searching for eluded them . Instead , by staying close to examining age-related changes to the bone , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals has in fact revealed findings of enormous relevance to us all . <p> A synchrotron image of a section of bone , with blood vessel canals in gold and osteocyte lacunae in red . Picture : Dave Cooper at the University of Saskatoon , Canada <p> With so many disciplines in the mix , the impacts may be felt from bone health to anthropology and archaeology , where findings may help us piece together the human story over vast timeframes . <p> " Blue Sky thinking ? " Professor Clement asks . " If we grow the collection in the future , we 'll be able to assess and compare a whole lot of demographic information that reflects Australia 's changing population . <p> " With a lot more information we 'll be able to explore some very big questions , such as the effects of pollution on our bones and of climate change .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> can stop cladding fires spreading <p> Researchers have found that treating building cladding with nano-sized particles of clay can prevent cladding fires from spreading , while significantly reducing the heat and smoke from burning <p> By Andrew Trounson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Tiny particles of " nanoclay " added to building cladding can radically reduce the risk of fires spreading , preventing future disasters like the Grenfell Tower blaze in London . <p> The Grenfell fire focused world attention on the dangers of plastic-backed aluminium cladding that is being blamed for the speed at which the fire spread , engulfing the 24-storey building . At least 80 people are dead , presumed dead , or missing . <p> But research by University of Melbourne engineers has found that adding nanoclay particles to plastic cladding can drastically reduce the heat and smoke that is emitted as it burns . And crucially , non-metal composite cladding treated with nanoclay does n't spread the fire during burning , allowing time for people to evacuate and for fire fighters to tackle the blaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heats up , these small particles of clay react and form an insulation barrier over the polymer plastic , protecting it from the heat and flame , " says Dr Kate Nguyen , Leader of the University 's Innovative Fire Engineering research group . " It effectively creates a " ceramic-like " barrier . " <p> In the wake of the Grenfell fire Australia 's Victoria state has appointed a taskforce to fast-track its investigation into flammable cladding that followed the 2014 fire at the Lacrosse Building in Melbourne that is similarly covered in combustible aluminium-backed cladding . <p> The particles of nanoclay are just 5 nanometres thick -- that is 0.000005 millimetres . Laboratory test results found that glass-fibre cladding material with the nanoclay particles reduced heat and smoke emissions by 40 per cent , and prevented the fire from spreading . <p> Dr Nguyen 's research on nanoclay as a flame retardant goes back to 2011 as part of an Australian Research Council linkage grant led by Associate Professor Tuan Ngo in which she was working with a fa ? ade company to improve the fire safety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that nanoclay has been used to improve the fire performance of cladding . Dr Nguyen says the new material developed in this project could be used to manufacture cladding which is both safe and more attractive to builders and architects because it is more flexible than metal-backed cladding and can be used in more varied designs . <p> GFRP is constructed of glass fibre compacted together with an adhesive polymeric resin . It is this resin that is highly flammable . It means producers currently have to add large quantities of expensive fire-retardant powders that can limit the strength of the cladding . But Dr Nguyen and her colleagues found that only small quantities of nanoclay are needed to significantly reduce the fire risk to this type of cladding . <p> " It will still burn , but it wo n't produce the same heat and any fire wo n't spread , " says Dr Nguyen . While there are non-combustible mineral cladding alternatives on the market , she says these are heavier and less architecturally flexible . <p> The research involved extensive testing of different nanoclays to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like oil and water , some of the clays just did n't mix well with resin , " says Dr Nguyen .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Bullied school kids left behind in learning <p> The first large scale study into school bullying and academic achievement finds kids targeted by bullying are well behind in their learning , and the impact is worse on girls <p> By Andrew Trounson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Primary school children who suffer frequent bullying are at greater risk of being left well behind in their learning . And this learning disadvantage weighs more heavily on girls , even though boys are more likely to experience bullying . <p> In what is the first large-scale study to examine the links between bullying and academic achievement , researchers at Australia 's Murdoch Children 's Research Institute and the University of Melbourne found that children who reported being bullied on weekly basis were on average six-to-nine months behind their peers in their studies . <p> They also found that physical bullying was particularly damaging to academic achievement , but that girls were also vulnerable to falling behind as a result of verbal bullying .

One in three boys and one in four girls reported being bullied once a week , largely in line with previous studies . <p> The mid-to-late years of primary school are when children report the highest frequency of bullying . <h> Learning disadvantage Substantial <p> Lead researcher Dr Lisa Mundy says the results the importance of efforts to prevent bullying at school , making it clear that the well-being of children is at least as important as their learning . <p> " The extent of the learning delay we found was substantial and actually surprised us , " says Dr Mundy . " Given these children have only been in school for three full years , the extent of the delay and disadvantage they experience compared to that of their peers is significant . " <p> " We already have evidence that bullying has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental problems , but to make this link with learning is really important in terms of providing that extra evidence and motivation for schools and teachers to take action to prevent bullying and promote positive peer relationships , " says Dr Mundy . <p> The study , published in the journal Academic Paediatrics , compared the result of child surveys conducted in classrooms with the performance of the children on Australia 's NAPLAN national standardised school test . It covered 43 schools in Melbourne , including government , private and catholic schools . Bullying was measured using the established Gatehouse Bullying Scale . Physical bullying was defined as being hit or kicked by another student , while verbal bullying was defined as teasing or being called names . <p> Boys were more likely to have been physically bullied with 18 per cent reporting frequent bullying , compared with 11 per cent of girls . But both boys and girls reported similar rates of frequent verbal bullying ( boys 15 per cent and girls 17 per cent ) . However the academic impact on girls was worse . <h> Impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average six months behind in writing related tasks , but the academic performance of boys was unaffected . <p> Girls reporting frequent physical bullying ( with or without verbal bullying ) were on average six-to-nine months behind on reading , numeracy , writing , spelling , grammar and punctuation . However boys reporting both frequent physical bullying ( with or without verbal bullying ) were also behind in both numeracy and writing . <p> " The study suggests that physical bullying may be more significant in terms of the association between bullying and academic performance , compared with verbal bullying , " Dr Mundy said . " But when we look at verbal bullying , girls appear to be more at risk . " <p> " It seems that girls might be more adversely affected by bullying at this age , which is in line with previous findings , but we do n't yet know why that may be . " <p> Nevertheless , she says that understanding these gender differences is important for schools in designing and implementing anti-bullying strategies . <p> " The results provide more information to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might respond to bullying and the differences in physical and verbal bullying , and how schools may deal with bullying . " <h> Whole of school approach <p> She says specific actions schools can take on preventing bullying include staff development , incorporating issues around bullying into the curriculum , and teaching students resilience and skills around dealing with bullying . But she says the critical thing was to ensure efforts to prevent bullying are enacted across a school as a whole . <p> " The evidence suggest that the most effective way to deal with bullying is to take a whole of school approach in which teachers , student , and the whole community including parents , are involved , " Dr Mundy says . <p> * changes related to school or preschool , such as not wanting to go , staying close to teachers during breaks , having difficulty asking or answering questions in class , not taking part in activities , sitting alone , and schoolwork and homework deteriorating suddenly <p> * emotional clues such as anxiety , nervousness , distress , unhappiness , depression or tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being quick to anger , and unhappiness at the end of weekends and holidays <p> * other signs such as your child talking about being teased , taunted , ridiculed , degraded , threatened , dominated , made fun of , or laughed at .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> our waterways , a garden stake at a time <p> For hundreds of years we 've cleared the natural debris that builds up in our waterways , wiping out the habitats and ecologies of river animals in the process . Now a low-tech idea is bringing them back . <p> By Alana Schetzer , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Over the last couple of hundred of years , we have drastically altered the Australian landscape . <p> Huge swaths of land have been cleared for agricultural purposes . Trees have been cut down to make way for roads and developments . Rivers and creeks have been cleared to prevent flooding , and have filled with sand due to erosion . And all of this has had a dramatic impact on the animals native to our waterways , forcing them to move away to find food and a suitable habitat . <p> But researchers at the University have come up with an amazingly simple solution . They have discovered that by planting garden stakes into river beds they can successfully restore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . <p> A typical view of Hughes Creek ( Victoria ) and many other streams flowing through agricultural landscapes . The stream bed is a sea of sand with almost no visible plant detritus anywhere . Picture : Supplied <p> Over the years , there has been significant research and work on trying to repair the damage done to Australia 's rivers and creeks . But many well-intentioned previous attempts have proved expensive and ineffectual . <p> " There have been two reviews in the past 10 years showing that most efforts have completely failed to deliver any improvements to species diversity in rivers " , says Professor Barbara Downes from the University of Melbourne 's School of Geography . <p> Enter the humble garden stake . <p> Dr Jill Lancaster , also from the School of Geography , is leading the research project that has made a dramatic improvement to species diversity in a Victorian creek . Dr Lancaster and Professor Downes used the wooden stakes to help recreate environments critical to river animals . And their results have environmental scientists around the world taking notice . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily on testing ecological theories about how dispersal is critical to preventing a loss of species diversity across landscapes . <p> Thanks to grants from the Australian Research Council 's Discovery Programme , they tested the hypothesis that aquatic animals disperse frequently and attempt to colonise streams filled with sand , but are unsuccessful due to the lack of food and shelter . These resources are provided by natural plant debris that drops into channels . <p> Hammering in stakes to set up a manipulation site on Hughes Creek . Picture : Supplied <p> In streams degraded by land clearance , such debris is either swallowed by the sand or swept away in winter floods because of the lack of branches and logs that can hold the debris in place in numerous small packs scattered across the stream bed . <p> Using simple wooden stakes -- the kind you can buy at garden nurseries for about a dollar -- the researchers , along with a team of student helpers , planted 25-50 pairs of stakes into the bed of a stream in specific locations . <p> Other areas were left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The premise is that leaves , branches , bark , twigs and other natural debris that travel downstream are caught or snagged on the stakes . It 's this build-up that provides a source of food and shelter for a range of animals -- like insects , snails and other invertebrates . <p> These species account for the majority of diversity in our waterways , but they also attract animals like fish and platypus , which feed on them . <p> The research was carried out at Hughes Creek , north of Melbourne , an area that is surrounded by cleared agricultural land . Within just four months of staking the creekbed , the researchers began to see an increase in the densities and diversity of invertebrates , including species that are typically found only in more intact and cooler areas upstream . <p> The researchers say they got an incredibly strong result . Moreover , it was the first landscape-scale field experiment in the world that 's been able to demonstrate the role that dispersal plays in creating diversity in degraded environments . <h> Low-tech , low-cost <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeks to health by replanting trees and undergrowth along the banks , but it 's an expensive process and one that requires labour and ongoing maintenance . <p> " It has n't translated into any improvements in diversity within the stream itself , " Professor Downes says . " There 's lots of wonderful effects on the banks -- you get increased birds and mammals and plants , but nothing for the streams . " <p> The appeal of the new technique is its low cost , low maintenance approach . <p> " It is very simple , " Dr Lancaster adds . " You do n't need expertise , you do n't need a lot of money , and the stakes will probably last three to four years . " <p> The research has also focused on a specific layout for the groups of wooden stakes . The distances between the groups need to be short , so animals can treat them as ' stepping stones ' within a waterway . If groups of stakes are too far apart , then many animals wo n't be able to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island hot spots , like Club Med . What we think happened is that they 've come as far as the first island , built up numbers and then hopped to the next one , " Dr Lancaster explains . <p> " In terms of restoration , you need to create little islands that are effectively close together so the animals just hop between them and it also ensures there is genetic diversity .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Meet the cow whisperer <p> Kenny 's serendipitous journey from rural Nigeria to the University of Melbourne 's robotic research dairy in Dookie has made him the University 's own cow whisperer <p> Share selection to : <p> When I came down to Dookie for the job interview I took one look at the dairy and fell in love with the whole idea . I said to the University , even if you do n't give me this job I 'm going to come down here anyway to keep visiting this place . It was brilliant to see the cows milking themselves voluntarily . The robotic dairy is completely different from a conventional dairy . <p> The first thing you notice is the quiet . There are no dogs rounding up the cows , there is no chasing or yelling at the cows . When I walk around them , they do n't feel like I am harassing them , so they feel a lot more comfortable around people . In a conventional dairy you have to move the cows in to be milked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But here we do n't have to do that because the cows wander in voluntarily to be milked . And cows are surprisingly very polite . They are happy to wait for the cow in front to have its turn and go through the dairy . It makes a big difference to their welfare , their health and their wellbeing . <p> The cows wear sensors in their collars that monitors their behaviour so they can tell us what they need . Picture : Paul Burston / University of Melbourne <p> Just like us , cows do n't want to do everything at the same time . Not all of us like to get out of bed at 5am . Some of us want to lie in bed until 7am . It is the same with cows and when they want to be milked . Keeping the cows comfortable and unstressed is one of the big plusses in a setting like this . The dairy even has a backscratcher that the cows can rub against after they 've been milked . And the result is more and better milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awards two years in a row , putting us among the top 100 farms with the best milk quality out of over 6500 dairy farms in Australia . <p> Once the cow enters the dairy to be milked we collect all sorts of data from in-built sensors . There is data on their body weight , the individual milk quality , the milk temperature and colouration of the milk , and the cow 's own activity . We can then compare that data with our own observations of how the cows are behaving and that way you learn a lot . <p> You know the cows are happy when you see them relaxed and quiet , and you want to see over half of them ruminating , or chewing their cud . This is when the cow re-chews regurgitated fodder as part of their digestion process and it is a very important indication of their wellness . When they are chewing their cud you know they have the right fibre content in their diet . And we can keep track of how many times each cow chews its cud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) transponder that has a small microphone . It is strapped to the left flank of their necks , and it allows us to listen to how frequently they are chewing their cud . Ideally , we like to see a rumination of roughly 400 minutes per cow per day . All that data is recorded on the computers so we can monitor it . <p> I joke that I 'm a cow whisperer . But it is really about spending the time observing the cows and tracking the data we collect . The cows are the best judges of what they need . If it is right they will tell you , and if it is wrong they will tell you by their behaviour . <p> For instance , it was by just observing their behaviour that the cows told me we had to change the gate opening time . <p> When cows come in from grazing in one part of the farm , they can only have access to their next grazing after they have gone through the dairy for milking . The dairy is the control station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the set time . The farm is divided into three blocks A , B and C , with cows getting fresh pasture in each block three times a day . We give them enough feed for about an eight-hour period after each visit . After roughly that time , they will be coming to the dairy voluntarily to transit to the next block for grazing . This way , we are able to manage our cows as well as our pasture . <p> But when I first started here I noticed that a lot of the cows were starting to line up at the gates for milking in the evening as early as 5pm when the gates were n't set to open until 7pm . After observing the cows waiting in the laneway when they were not due for their next grazing , I decided to bring forward the gate opening time , and it made an instant difference . Production went up because they were n't waiting at the gate , getting stressed and not eating . So I let the cows determine when they like to move from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and basically , just move the gate times to soothe them , and it works ! <p> The technology not only monitors the cows , it also tells me when things are n't working , even when I 'm in bed asleep . The system is set up with computer generated calls to alert me , or the other staff , if there is something not right with the machine ; for example cows failing milking , a filter needing replacing , or detergent supply is low . I 've had calls at every time of the day and night you can think of , particularly during the early days after the installation . One time I ended up just sleeping in the dairy because the alarm kept going off when it took longer than expected to fix the problems . But if you are doing everything by the book you will get less late night alarms . These days it might happen about two or three times a month . <p> I studied to become an engineer , not a farmer , but a lot of things in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nigeria , and most of my early childhood was spent in a country town about twice the size of Dookie . In that community , farming is the number one trade , and I spent a lot of time on my parent 's farm .

Then I saw an opportunity for a foreign exchange program in Australia and thought , " why not ? " Suddenly I found myself in Western Australia on the Margaret River working on a dairy farm . It was hard work , but the animals were intriguing . They are such big and heavy creatures . Of course I do n't see them as big any more , I see them as little pets , but at first they seemed really big . And from the start I was fascinated with how cows are managed and how you encourage them to do what you want them to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelling around Australia and fell in love with the country . I returned back home after a year and I realised I wanted to come back to Australia , but it was n't easy . I ended up going to the UK but it was n't for me . Finally , there was a work opportunity to come to New Zealand because of my dairy farming experience . So there I was , back on a dairy farm as an assistant herd manager in New Zealand . <p> Those early mornings getting up in sub-zero temperatures were n't at all nice for an African boy ! But I decided to give dairy farming a go and so I went through all the industry training programs on offer in New Zealand up to a diploma . It was while I was studying that I got a job working on Lincoln University 's commercial dairy farm in Christchurch .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Trump and the decline of the virtuous presidency <p> Trump 's presidency is directly at odds with the Founding Fathers ' ideals for the office to be one of virtue and dignity <p> By George Rennie , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> The Founding Fathers of the United States emphasised the conditions necessary for a stable and lasting republic : a system of codified laws and government , a democratic mechanism for the formation of government and a belief that all office bearers conduct themselves as moral and virtuous leaders . <p> For no office bearer was this last condition more important , they felt , than the presidency . <p> The Founders lived by a set of carefully considered values , and the country 's 44 presidents have attempted -- with mixed success -- to do the same . The 45th President makes no such effort . <p> In making the philosophical case for independence and the Republic , the Founders stressed the need for virtue in office . In Federalist 68 , ( one of eighty-five essays urging the citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton ( one of the founding fathers ) wrote that " the distinguished office of president " requires that a candidate have " merit to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole union " . <p> Trumbull 's Declaration of Independence , depicting the Committee of Five presenting their draft of the Declaration of Independence to the Congress on June 28 , 1776 . The committee included Founding Fathers John Adams , Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson . Picture : Wikimedia <p> In Federalist 57 , James Madison wrote that the Constitution ought to obtain rulers who possess " most virtue to pursue the common good of the society . " <p> They were clear that virtue and dignity were critical for a president . But how was virtue defined ? <p> On the one hand , by the Founders ' ideal of Christ : charitable , thoughtful , forgiving . And , on the other hand , virtue was defined by more humanist and Enlightenment values : by a person 's willingness to respectfully listen , debate , and philosophically engage with others ' ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Trump , has raised vexing questions ( putting aside , for the moment , emoluments scandals or the ' Russia issue ' ) -- should a president be impeached because of their extreme crassness ? And , should the 25th Amendment , which sets out the procedures for replacing a president , be invoked ? <p> These legal and ethical questions are unclear ( though the use of the 25th is almost certainly a non-starter ) . <p> However , what is clear is the intent of the Founders -- the President should be of outwardly exemplary behaviour , even if inwardly confounded by moral or philosophical demons . <p> To that end , President Trump is fundamentally failing the intent of America 's Founding Fathers . And Twitter , of all things , is the principal means by which he does so . <h> The " Twitterer in Chief " <p> Presidential tweets are new , but they pre-date Trump . Barack Obama used them to augment his communications . He tweeted press bulletins , considered statements of support or condemnation on matters of national importance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were considered and restrained , and in keeping with the careful deliberation of the departments of the US executive . Policy statements were not made on the fly , at 2am , nor were they made in response to what some celebrity said , or from some journalistic or personal slight . <p> By contrast , Trump 's tweets are frequently viscous and petty . He routinely attacks political opponents , but devotes most of his time to attacking the media . <p> Many leaders believe that the media is biased against them , but Trump 's assault is relentless and unprecedented . He seems to believe that the media is not only out to get him ( which arguably is its job ) , but that , in turn , it deserves to be viciously -- even violently -- mocked and vilified . <h> The assault on the Fourth Estate <p> Beyond spats with celebrities and political rivals , it is the President 's relentless assault on the press that is most concerning . <p> Trump attacks the " mainstream media " , but this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who disagree with him . Fox and Friends , Breitbart , and other friendlies are okay , but every non-supportive platform is " fake news " . <p> By no means does this live up to the intents of the Founders . They wanted to get away from the tyrannical British King , not create their own American one . From this came the " Madisonian system " of checks and balances . <p> Any decent civics class teaches that American government is Madisonian in design . It is tripartite and democratic , and it is constituted by the executive , legislative , and judicial branches at state and federal levels . <p> That same civics class would then recognise that a well-informed electorate is essential to the proper function of the US system . <p> And , as we can not expect individual members of that electorate to be experts , they must rely on representatives in government , and an independent watchdog to assist them in making their democratic choice . That watchdog , more than any other , has always been the " Fourth Estate " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President to assault the Fourth Estate is to assault democratic ideals . <p> One of Trump 's latest tweets depicts a violent confrontation between him ( at a wrestling match ) , and a hapless proxy representing CNN ( and , per Trump 's tweets , the " mainstream media " ) . <p> The imagery is juvenile , but profound when used by a President . The implication , that violence against the media ( literal or figurative ) is not only acceptable , but to be celebrated , is reprehensible . <p> So far , Trump 's most recent anti-media tweet has led to yet another round of condemnation and shock . Ironically , the Reddit user from which the meme originated apologised for posting the video , yet the President remains unrepentant , indignant . <p> A Reddit user posting a silly ( if somewhat violent ) video is not a serious matter , nor is it a matter for national consternation . A President posting that same video , however , is a serious matter : both a cause for serious consternation and condemnation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Donald Trump 's presidency . He , like his supporters , insists that we hold him to the standard of a layperson , but fails to recognise that the ideal of his office is one of moral , as well as pragmatic , leadership . He also fails to recognise that the average person , as with the " Reddit troll " mentioned before , actually lives up to a generally higher standard : capable of reticence and introspection in a way that their president is not . <h> The new bully pulpit <p> When the term " bully pulpit " was coined , it referred to the anachronistic understanding of " bully " , which essentially meant " good news " . To that end , the pioneers of the bully pulpits in early 20th century American presidencies dedicated themselves to rallying the spirits of the country ( even in the darkest of times ) , and tried to exude high moral standards . <p> This can no longer be said to be true . Instead , the President 's bully pulpit has adopted a contemporaneous meaning -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridicule . <p> And yet , it is excused away by supporters . The justification for the President 's basest behaviour falls under the banner of " populism " and " accessibility " . The @POTUS tweets , we are told , are merely democracy at its most direct . <p> Were this true , President Trump would respond considerately to his detractors , and listen to the voices asking him to curtail his worst behaviours . Instead , he re-tweets his supporters ' most sycophantic statements of support , and meets detractors with curt retorts -- " sad " , " pathetic " , " lying " , " crooked " . <p> Samuel Adams , one of the founding fathers , once wrote , " No people can be great who have ceased to be virtuous . " If Trump truly wants America to be " Great Again " , he must recognise what makes a person virtuous , and live by that ideal .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> How objects could soon ' heal ' themselves <p> A new 3D printed gel that can heal like living tissue , and change form in response to environments , has myriad applications from fixing cracked phone screens to adaptive camouflage <p> By Cheryl Critchley , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Cracking your phone or tablet screen is one of modern life 's big frustrations , as well as a potentially costly one . <p> That awful crunch as your phone hits the footpath or your iPad crashes onto the kitchen tiles is enough to send chills down the spine of every self-respecting technology lover . <p> But expensive screen repairs could one day be a thing of the past thanks to University of Melbourne researchers who are developing a unique self-healing gel that could potentially be used to prevent screens from cracking , or ' heal ' themselves if they do . <p> A new self-healing gel could make cracked phone screens a thing of the past . Picture : iStock <p> It sounds too good to be true , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self-healing gel that regenerates after being cut -- just like living tissue . <p> Melbourne School of Engineering researcher Dr Luke Connal says 3D printers can potentially revolutionise manufacturing , but until now suitable printing materials have been limited . To help rectify this , his team has developed a polymer-based ' ink ' that can self-heal . It adds the fourth dimension -- time -- to 3D printing , in that the material can change shape over time . <p> The gel-like ink starts off similar in texture to toothpaste . When you apply pressure it can flow , becoming stable again when the pressure is removed . <p> " After printing , these objects can heal a crack or even a cut and regain their original strength , " Dr Connal explains . <p> " This could enable custom printing of coatings that can heal after breakages , potentially as coatings for mobile phones . <p> " The materials we developed can also change shape when triggered by being swollen in a solvent , such as water . This enables printed objects to change shape once printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Led by PhD student Milena , Dr Connal 's team , which included Dr Xiao , has had a paper published in The Royal Society of Chemistry 's Molecular Systems Design &amp; Engineering journal . <p> " Self-healing materials are capable of recovering from damages and restoring their functionality , just like the natural ability of living creatures to repair their tissues , " their report explained . " This unique property offers the ability to extend the lifetime of products , which is usually limited by mechanical failures . " <p> The healing process is based on dynamic covalent chemistry . " This means we can form , break and reform chemical bonds , " Dr Connal explains . " When we can do this in a controlled and triggered manner we can manipulate the properties of the printed objects .

And we reverse this -- enabling healing of cracks in the material , " he says . <p> The goal is to develop selective coatings for high-end products that are subject to stress , such as mobile phones , hand held devices and car surfaces that can self-heal when cut . <p> These self-healing ' smart ' objects could also change their shape upon sensing their chemical environment , enabling the fourth dimension , time , to also influence them . <p> Ultimately , Dr Connal says a mobile phone screen could be made of the special gel .

That opens up the possibility of developing chameleon-like technology such as for camouflage . <p> " We are working on this to develop adaptive camouflage materials , " Dr Connal says . " We aim to have a 3D printable ink that can be printed by soldiers in remote locations that can change colour so they can blend into their environments . <p> " The 3D printing capability means the soldiers could travel with significantly less materials and only print what is required for the specific location . " <p> Another idea is to create materials that will enable submarine officers to use a 3D printer to create spare parts as needed , eliminating the need to store dozens of parts on board . The possibilities are endless . <p> " There is so much potential to develop new materials for 3D printing .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Confessions of a professional baby maker <p> VOICEOVER This is Up Close , the research talk show from the University of Melbourne , Australia . <p> ANDI HORVATH Hi I 'm Andi Horvath , thanks for joining us . In the late 20th century scientists developed IVF to assist couples who could n't conceive naturally . The term in vitro fertilisation , IVF , actually refers to the creation of an embryo in a dish , but that 's really only half the picture . An embryo then has to be transferred to a uterus and implantation has to take place . In the early days of IVF , multiple embryos were transplanted increasing the chances that one would take , but often the result was multiple births , such as triplets , bringing with it a new set of pregnancy and parenting complications . But IVF has moved on with improvements to the technology . <p> Our guest today on Up Close is reproductive biologist , David Gardner . He 's been instrumental in growing our understanding of what makes for a viable embryo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . David 's work has contributed to making single embryo transfer as the standard for IVF today and as David will tell us , studying embryo viability is giving us unexpected insights into the world of cell growth and proliferation beyond IVF including potentially how cancers take hold . <p> Professor David Gardner is a member of the Australian Academy of Science and a professor in the School of Biosciences , University of Melbourne . He 's the author of 15 books and countless articles on embryology and IVF and is well known as a guru of human embryo development . David , welcome . <p> DAVID GARDNER Thank you . <p> ANDI HORVATH When were researchers first able to fertilise an egg with sperm outside the mammalian body and see this replicating ball of cells ? <p> DAVID GARDNER Well it was really efforts at Cambridge in the laboratory of Robert Edwards where they were able to get various eggs from different species and establish how to do in vitro fertilisation . But it was really only in the late 1970s that it was possible to get a routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really was a serendipitous chance finding that came about when Professor Edwards was at a seminar with Patrick Steptoe , who 's a gynaecologist . Patrick was able to show how to use a laparoscope to look inside a patient . When Bob saw this he immediately realised that this was a way to source human oocytes . <p> So this wonderful collaboration between a scientist and a physician that established means of collecting human eggs and ultimately the fertilisation of the human egg in a culture dish and this occurred in the 1970s . Finally , they were able to translate this into a clinical practice and the first fertilised egg was transferred successfully into a patient in 1978 in Oldham in the North of England . Nine months later , the miracle baby , Louise Brown , was born in July . <p> ANDI HORVATH There 's a potted history of IVF that we needed . Now tell us the facts of life . What happens immediately after conception ? <p> DAVID GARDNER The fertilised egg undergoes a series of divisions . So to understand what happens is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . It 's about 110 microns across . So it 's just smaller than a full stop on a printed page , but it 's a very big cell . So the first thing that happens after the sperm enters the cell is that the embryo goes through divisions . But the cells actually get smaller and these are called cleavage divisions and the embryo 's called a cleavage stage . So we have one , two , four , eight cells and it 's at this time of development that the embryo 's normally transferred , back in the 70s and 80s , to the uterus of the patient . <p> ANDI HORVATH When did they first realise that a ball of cells outside the dish could go back into the body ? <p> DAVID GARDNER Well it was known for decades that you could do this in animal models . So in mice and in sheep you could grow embryos and transfer them and that was during the 1960s and 1970s . So the proof of principle study was done many years before . So we knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being able to access the human egg . So it 's really this breakthrough that Patrick Steptoe , the gynaecologist , had we 've been able to access eggs through laparoscopy that led the way to creating the embryos . <p> I think it was always a given that those embryos would be able to be put back and they would give rise to pregnancies . <p> ANDI HORVATH So what makes the embryo attach to the uterine wall and why does n't the uterine wall reject it ? <p> DAVID GARDNER Okay , so after five days of development , the embryo creates what we call a blastocyst , it 's a big ball of cells . So at this point it 's created an epithelium and it started to differentiate into two cell types , the outer cells go on to form placenta . Inside of this ball of cells is a small group of cells , about 20 cells , called the inner cell mass . It 's from those cells that we get the baby . So implantation is an interaction between the outer layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lining of the uterus which we call the endometrium . It 's a very elegant dialogue between the baby to be and the mother to be . The baby to be has to say to the mother to be , look I 'm here , please do n't have a menstrual cycle , please do n't she 'd the lining of your uterus and at the same time the lining of the uterus has to be prepared enough for it to say , well welcome basically . I 'm ready to receive you with open arms . <p> ANDI HORVATH Tell us about some of the challenges for IVF technology before it became mainstream ? <p> DAVID GARDNER I think one of the biggest things is that we knew so little about the human embryo . We did n't know what it needed to grow . All our early attempts to grow the embryo were done using what we call tissue culture media or very simple salt solutions . They were empirical , they were n't actually based on what the embryo needed . It was rather like we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than listening to them and say what would you like to eat ? I think that was the big difference . <p> So in the early days , embryos really did n't grow very well and they only managed to survive typically for one to two days in the laboratory . So for fertilisation up to implantation it takes about five days . Clearly , we were n't able to maintain the later stages of growth in the culture dish and that was the problem . So as a result of this it became normal to put back these early embryos on day two or day three into the uterus , but here 's the catch , those embryos do n't belong in the uterus at that stage . They 're normally residing in the fallopian tube , the oviduct . So we 're putting back these embryos too soon . <p> Now what we know again from extensive research on several different mammalian species , whether it 's a sheep or a cow or a mouse , that if you put the embryo back too early into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simple , the oviduct and the uterus create different environments . So we 're putting the embryo back into somewhere that it does n't belong with the wrong nutrients and so it does n't do very well . <p> ANDI HORVATH Now in the early days of IVF they had to do multiple embryo transfers , why did they do that ? <p> DAVID GARDNER Well because we 're putting back embryos , what we call asynchronously , we were putting back embryos at day two and day three back into the uterus . That environment did not support the embryo growth . So consequently , implantation was compromised . Only maybe 10 percent of those embryos , 15 percent of those embryos gave rise to an implantation . Now the patient has been through an awful lot to get to that period of the embryo transfer . So to increase the potential of a pregnancy , rather than have just one embryo put back , if you put two or three or even four back , as was very common in the 80s and 90s , certainly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient getting pregnant . <p> Now four percent of all pregnancies in Australia are multiple gestations but in the early days of IVF 25 percent of the multiples came from IVF cycles . So it 's a bit of a paradox if you think about it . Infertility , infertile patients actually contributed the most to multiple gestations in every developed country and that 's because we were putting back too many embryos . <p> ANDI HORVATH Now infertility , what 's the causes of infertility ? <p> DAVID GARDNER There are so many causes of infertility . Infertility affects one in six couples . One in six couples need medical intervention to conceive a child . I think people are often very surprised when they hear it 's that common . It 's something that people do n't like to talk about . I refer to it as the silent sickness in society . For women , it 's easier to discuss but for men it 's something that they do n't want to go down to the pub and say , hey guys I ca n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> So in about a third of the cases of infertility , it 's maybe a tubal factor for the woman , she has blocked tubes or there 's some endometrial problems . So in other words , her uterus lining wo n't receive the embryo . There are many other causes , but it 's about a third of the cases are attributed to the woman . A further third are attributed to the men in which he has problems producing sperm and the sperm are either too few or abnormal . Then we have the other third which we call idiopathic in which we just do n't know . It could be both the patients are suffering subfertility but in those cases often the diagnosis is not that clear . <p> ANDI HORVATH So how does the quality of the gametes , the egg and sperm matter when creating a viable embryo ? <p> DAVID GARDNER It is important to look after your eggs and to look after your sperm . It sounds quite obvious . When you 're a parent you do everything you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way through to adolescence . You do absolutely everything . You go out of the way to optimise their nutrition , to look after their welfare and yet it 's ironic that before birth people do n't really consider the health of their gametes , the very gametes that are going to give rise to the child . Well it does transpire , it 's terribly important to look after your sperm or your eggs . <p> One of the best things you can do is through diet . It 's become evident now through research around the world , including our laboratory , in this case in animal models , if either the male or the female becomes obese through inappropriate diet then the sperm and the eggs in due course become compromised . You can see this quite clearly , you see lower fertilisation rates , but the embryos do n't develop as well . This , we now know is then translated further down into fetal development and into adulthood . So it 's really important that we think about getting fit for conception . That we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of the health of our future children . <p> ANDI HORVATH I 'm Andi Horvath . We 're talking about how in vitro embryo technologies developed , and where they 're going with embryologist , David Gardner , here on Up Close . Now explain for us a little bit about epigenetics . The role of say even the womb environment on the growing embryo . Now there 's some famous historic research I know you 're going to share with us . <p> DAVID GARDNER Right , the term epigenetics means above the gene really . So it 's looking at how your genes are expressed without changes to the actual structure of the genes themselves . So things that actually regulate the turning on and turning off of your genes and a lot of those can be environmental and a lot of those are diet . <p> So in the Second World War , there was a very famous case of a Dutch famine where the Germans blockaded food to the Dutch people and caloric restriction , their calorie intake was about a third of what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually pregnant at the time . So they actually went through a whole pregnancy or part of a pregnancy with insufficient calories . It transpired when those children were then followed on into adulthood they had an increased risk for cancers , heart disease and other morbidities . These were translated all the way back to development in utero . <p> Since then a theory called the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease has evolved in which it 's implicated that events during your life in utero , in other words what your mother eats , what she 's exposed to whether it 's smoking or whatever , pollutants , will affect not only your growth as a fetus but will affect your subsequent health and ultimately how you will die as an adult . What we 're learning now is that that goes all the way back to the embryo before implantation and it goes back to the gametes before fertilisation . <p> So really this whole concept of being fit for fertility is about your gametes , it 's about your embryo , it 's about your fetus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely children , it 's about taking them all the way to adulthood , but it starts as a single cell . <p> ANDI HORVATH David , explain the stresses on a ball of embryonic cells outside the womb because that 's not in its normal environment . So we 're creating a different environment when we 're nurturing it and that must have an effect , or does it ? <p> DAVID GARDNER No , it does . When we grow an embryo in a culture dish , we have to be very mindful that we maintain things like temperature at all times because that can affect the physiology , the pH , that 's the levels of acidity and alkalinity have to be very tightly controlled , just as they are in the human body . So we have to use special incubators that can regulate , the precise pH for the embryos to develop . <p> With regards to the environment , the culture environment , as I alluded to in the early days of IVF those solutions were pretty much empirically developed . The turning point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human IVF working with Carl Wood and John Leeton , two of the pioneers here in Australia , and I said to them , well I would love to know what 's inside the human oviduct and the human uterus so I could recreate a better culture environment for the embryos . <p> Both John and Carl were able to do that . They got me samples of oviduct and uterine fluids and our team analysed them for nutrients . It was from there that we created two media , one based around the oviduct and one based around the uterus . From that we were pleasantly surprised that we could actually maintain the human embryo to the blastocyst stage . So we could grow a one cell embryo for five days to 100 cells , readily in vitro . That had not been done routinely before . That was the turning point because once we 'd developed these blastocysts , we were able to put them back into the uterus at a time they would normally enter . The consequence of which was the implantation rates doubled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do multiple embryos as well . <p> DAVID GARDNER Yeah , that 's exactly right . One of the big problems , certainly in America was this high order multiple gestations . So in the mid-90s , the average number of embryos being transferred in the USA in an in vitro fertilisation clinic was five . So that 's a lot . Consequently , there were lots of twins and there were lots of triplets . There was a population that desperately needed to reduce the number of embryos being transferred . So in the mid-90s I moved to America to implement clinically this blastocyst transfer technology . We were able to show conclusively in prospective randomised trials that implantation rates were significantly higher per embryo . Meaning that we could get patients pregnant with significantly fewer embryos . Ultimately as we improved the technology we got down to just transferring one embryo at a time . <p> ANDI HORVATH Tell me more about the embryo cell culture , I 'm curious . You mentioned temperature , pH , did you use antioxidants , what 's involved in creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So one of the things we learnt from analysing oviduct uterine fluid was that there were gradients of nutrients and these nutrients were very striking at first glance . So the oviduct does n't have much glucose in it , but it does have a lot of what we call pyruvic acid and lactate . Conversely the uterus has a lot of glucose but very low levels of the pyruvate and lactate . It mirrored what we already knew about what the embryo needed . When we asked the embryo , what did you need and we were able to answer that question by very clever micro-analytical technologies we developed . <p> The embryo says that pretty much early on I do n't want glucose . I need these other acids and I need some amino acids . Later on , as the embryo develops and becomes more complicated it needs a lot of glucose and it needs a wider variety of amino acids to fulfil several niches in their physiologies . So it was really understanding the complexities of how the embryo changed . When I first started studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physiologist or a psychiatrist because every day the tissue became something different . It was changing its personality and that was gorgeous because every day it was taking on more and more of an adult phenotype as it progressed . <p> ANDI HORVATH Wow , so you were monitoring its glucose needs and its protein needs and you were also noticing the various acids that it was making from glucose metabolism , like lactate ? <p> DAVID GARDNER Right . <p> ANDI HORVATH So David is there an algorithm that you can make to decide what is a viable embryo by looking at it , by testing nutrients , that sort of thing ? <p> DAVID GARDNER That 's kind of the holy grail of IVF . How do we pick the embryo ? We create on average 10 embryos . How do we know which one to transfer ? Of those 10 we create , five or six will form blastocysts , but which one do we put back . So there are various things you can do . Over recent years we 've had access to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the embryo in real time every 10 minutes . Then we get a really interesting history of how these embryos develop . So using this technology which has been referred to as , so morphology and time kinetics , , we and others have put together various attempts at creating algorithms , mathematical models that will help us select the best embryo . The data 's really quite promising with those , but prospective trials have yet to be fully undertaken . <p> The other thing you can do though is you can measure what the embryo consumes . We 've done this in animal models and what we 've shown conclusively and in a pilot , clinical study was that the embryo , certainly at the blastocyst stage consumed , in this case , the most glucose which is their preferred nutrient , have a much higher pregnancy potential . So currently our research is looking at taking these algorithms where we 've looked at the embryo and at the same time we 're starting to measure what each embryo was doing and so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're having all this data helping us now to select those embryos for transfers . <p> ANDI HORVATH On Up Close today we 're talking about the new insights coming out of research into embryo viability with reproductive biologist , David Gardner . I 'm Andi Horvath . <p> I want to come back to the nutrients the embryo uses and the metabolites that you measure . So lactate which is made from using glucose in the cells is instrumental for the uterine wall . Explain that to us . <p> DAVID GARDNER Well this is recent work and ongoing . So it 's really more of a creative hypothesis than fact . What we know , and what we 've known for many years , is that the embryo has a really idiosyncratic metabolism at the blastocyst stage . So just before implantation this beautiful ball of cells does something very , very strange . It consumes a lot of glucose and it can oxidise it but it chooses also to put into the environment a lot of lactic acid . Now most tissues do one or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're an athlete or when you train and you run you become anaerobic and you produce a lot of lactate and you do n't oxidise that glucose . <p> ANDI HORVATH Right , that 's that pain in your muscles , is n't it ? <p> DAVID GARDNER Exactly , that 's when you have to stop , that 's the cramp . So it puzzled us , why does the embryo do that ? When I went to the literature to find out what other cells behave this way , I really could only find one and that was a cancer . Indeed , this phenomenon of being able to produce lots of this lactate that normally you get after running , but producing it all the time , was observed in cancers in the 1920s . A German biochemist by the name of Otto Warburg who won the Nobel Prize for this observation determined that cancers produced lots of lactate . But he thought that they did it because there was a of their mitochondria which are the organelles that your cells use to oxidise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The cancer has mitochondria that can oxidise , they just choose to produce a lot of lactate . Same with the blastocyst . So for many years I said , well that 's interesting embryos are like cancers . A few years ago , I had what I would call a bit of a light bulb moment when I thought , actually that might not be the case . Why do cells produce lots of lactate ? <p> Well if you think about this embryo , this beautiful ball of cells it has to attach to the lining of the uterus . It then , like a cancer , has to invade . It has to basically disaggregate the cells of the mum and push itself inside . It 's a very coarse term , but that 's exactly what happens . Then it has to do two more things . It has to say , you know what , I need some blood . I need to establish a blood supply . We call it angiogenesis . So how does an embryo , how does a cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the cancer trick the host to give it blood . Then finally , of course , the embryo is technically a foreign tissue to the mother and a cancer is certainly a foreign tissue to us , how do you evade immune rejection ? How do you stop the body killing us ? <p> So these are the commonalities , these are the things that an embryo and a cancer have in common . They both need to invade . They both need to establish a blood supply and they both have to say do n't kill me . So through extensive research and reading , it turns out that lactate can act as a signal to tissues to enhance the activities of enzymes that are involved in the breakdown of tissues . It 's a signal to induce blood supply formation and finally it turns out it 's an immunosuppressant . <p> So , if you can imagine , this embryo creating what I like to think of as this lactate cloud , it surrounds itself with this cloud of lactate which is also acidic . So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that facilitates tissue degradation , angiogenesis the formation of blood and the prevention of . If you look what cancers do , that 's exactly what cancers do . So whereas I used to think that embryos were like cancers , I do n't think that anymore . I think that cancers are like embryos and that cancers use every trick in the book that the embryo has established to create a successful implantation . <p> ANDI HORVATH So this gives us some clue to cell activity , cancers , what then next ? Where do you see this research leading to ? <p> DAVID GARDNER Establishing a normal implantation is essential for the health of the baby . It 's absolutely imperative that that dialogue between the embryo and the mum takes place . The problem , as you can imagine if you want to research that , is that you 've got a uterus inside the body and then you 've got an embryo . How do you study that interaction ? It 's very , very difficult . One of the things you could do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look how they interact with embryos . What we 've been doing is been working with Frank Caruso here at the University of Melbourne who 's a biomolecular engineer . With Frank , we 've created what we call synthetic blastocysts and these are the same size as an actual human embryo , but they 're made out of polymers that we 've created . They are able to release , in this case , lactate but they 're also able to release other signals to the endometrial tissue and we can look for what kind of response they elicit in the uterus . That is helping us try to break down this dialogue . What are the signals that are essential for a normal implantation ? <p> ANDI HORVATH What about the converse , can we use this for cancer research ? <p> DAVID GARDNER Well the thing about implantation research or looking at these blastocysts , number one is that if you can understand what promotes implantation , technically you could also create a contraceptive . You can do the converse . That 's somewhere where that research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , yes , if you can work out what it is that establishes a dialogue between one invasive tissue to make another one receptive , it 's plausible that lessons learnt from the blastocyst could be passed onto cancer research . Now to this point it 's known that , for example , that you could reduce the availability of glucose to a cancer , can actually have a detrimental effect on that cancer 's growth . So something as fundamental as blocking glucose utilisation could have a profound effect . <p> If you want to look holistically , I think this is when it gets really exciting is when we start talking about our diets . I mean we were talking about , further on , looking at our epigenetics and how we interact . I think this is now , this whole new era and if I may introduce you to a new -omic . We talk about epigenomics and genomics and proteomics . <p> ANDI HORVATH Proteomics . <p> DAVID GARDNER Exactly . Now we have metabolomics . One of the most exciting areas of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the meshing of metabolism and epigenetics . This is called the . Basically , what it means is that you are what you eat . That 's the nicest way of looking at it . In terms of the embryos themselves , you are what your mum eats or your dad ate before you were conceived and we 're learning fascinating things in this arena . I think there 's some really important life lessons for all of us and it 's all coming from our studies on these embryos before implantation . <p> ANDI HORVATH So what 's the next imperative for IVF ? It 's actually , can I guess , watch what you eat for breakfast , lunch and dinner . <p> DAVID GARDNER I would love to see the way people think about having a family is that they need to get the message that before they come to a clinic that they need to get fit . It 's fit for fertility as it were , fit for reproduction and look after themselves because then you 're going to have healthier gametes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who do need IVF , and there still would be many , because diet is n't going to overcome a blocked oviduct , a fallopian tube . It 's not going to overcome a low sperm count per se , so you 're still going to need some kind of intervention . But what we can say is that at least epigenetically and in terms of health , we 're giving those gametes the best possible chance . <p> ANDI HORVATH I 'm going to ask a futuristic question , but why bother putting the fertilised embryo back into the uterus ? Ca n't we just nurture it outside ? <p> DAVID GARDNER Sounds like a great idea and I 'm sure there 'll be many , many women listening to this would go , please do that , that would be great . However , our understanding of the embryo post implantation and again coming back it 's so hard to study those embryos and their interactions with the mother , that right now I really think that is still science fiction but it 's something that obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we speculate further , what needs to happen ? <p> DAVID GARDNER That 's a very good question . Fully understanding the process of implantation and what are the signals from the mum ? What are the , what we call growth factors , the cytokines , what are these very complex signalling pathways that are elicited and how does the embryo respond to that . If you get those wrong you 're going to create abnormal development . So it 's really imperative that research continues to understand what it takes for a healthy embryo to interact and establish that first phase of pregnancy which is implantation .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Challenging the vertical sprawl <p> The towers crowding out the centre of Australian cities are a symptom of failed governance and planning , and it 's threatening any transition to ecocities <p> By Andrew Trounson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> To understand the major barrier to making our cities more sustainable and environmentally friendly places , just stand in the centre of almost any Australian city and look up . The chances are you will be in the shadow of a tall building totally reliant on air-conditioning and made from energy-intensive materials like steel . <p> Poet Dorothea Mackellar once lauded Australia for its " wide horizons " and " sweeping plains " but the country is now a land of high rises . Incredibly for its small population , Australia ranks sixth in the world for the number of buildings standing above 150m . <p> It has almost 100 such skyscrapers , putting it only behind more populous nations like China , the US , Japan , South Korea , and the small but United Arab Emirates . Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings standing over 100m at 352 . <p> Professor Brendan Gleeson , from the University of Melbourne , calls it " vertical sprawl " and it is spreading as more and more high rises are approved . He warns it is a symptom of a serious problem that threatens to block our cities from ever becoming sustainable ecocities -- weak metropolitan governance that has left planning hostage to short-term profit seeking . <p> " By vertical sprawl I mean the poor-quality , high-density buildings that are increasingly compacting our cities , " says Professor Gleeson , the Director of the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute . " They are poorly designed , poorly orientated and are being built too close together with little or no regard for urban and green spaces . " <p> Indeed , he notes that an international study has found that high-rise developments in Melbourne were being allowed at sometimes four times the maximum densities of Hong Kong , New York and Tokyo . <p> A map of Melbourne showing new buildings under construction ( yellow ) , approved for construction ( green ) and pending approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Density is usually expressed as the ratio between the built floor space and the size of a site . In Hong Kong and New York the maximum density ratio is 10:1 and 12:1 respectively , but recent developments in Melbourne have been around 30:1 and as high as 55:1 , meaning the buildings are not only tall but are covering a lot of ground area too . <p> " The vertical sprawl has been driven by a combination of property developers seeking to maximise their yield from the high-value land in our inner cities , and a lack of regulation that has simply re-zoned areas for development and then just let the market rip . " <p> While there are suggestions that compact cities of high rises can be more sustainable and free up space , Professor Gleeson says the evidence indicates that high rises are much more energy and resource intensive than medium-density developments , such as low-rise buildings that do n't need lifts . <p> Hong Kong has imposed maximum density ratios of less than 10:1 on new buildings compared with developments in Melbourne that are three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is very hard to design high rises that are n't reliant on air-conditioning , so from the start you are on the back foot in terms of reducing energy consumption , " says Professor Gleeson . <p> " While high-density living is promoted as a supposedly green shift , it is these high-rise buildings that will prove the most vulnerable to climate change and rising temperatures .

The City 's Heat Wave Response plan of 2008 warned that up to 297,000 workers may have to be evacuated . Melbourne 's heat threshold at which health alerts are issued is set at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next including the minimum overnight temperature . <p> " We have enough evidence now to show that tall residential buildings perform surprisingly badly in terms of both water and energy consumption , " says Professor Gleeson . " You might build high-rise buildings for various reasons , such as if there is a land shortage , but there is n't any environmental reason for building them . <p> " The first thing we have to do is dump this idea that we should Australian cities . Population growth means we do need to move towards more higher-density living , but we have to do it a lot better than we have been . <p> " What the evidence shows is that well-designed medium-density development comes out best . " <p> Professor Gleeson warns that " " Australian citiies is n't the way to make them sustainable . Picture : <p> He says the more distributed or decentralised cities focusing on medium-density developments , are becoming more possible and environmentally desirable as technology advances . The rise of solar power and batteries to store energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same is true of water and waste technology . Professor Gleeson says the potential for greening rooftops for gardens and food growing offers similar opportunities for decentralisation , potentially reducing the whole community 's reliance on vulnerable centralised services . <p> " But if we are to achieve this we will need as pre-condition much firmer , and better informed , governance of Australian cities . " <p> The problem , he says , is that the governance of Australia 's cities is split between large state governments and many small councils , with no one body responsible for overseeing the city and its suburbs . At the same time he says the privatisation of urban services is eroding the power of governments in terms of planning . <p> " We have gone too far down the road toward what is called ' urban splintering ' . There are simply too many power players now competing with the public interest . " <p> What 's needed , he argues , is the revival of a body like the previous Melbourne Board of Works that could be responsible for planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against suggestions that councils be amalgamated , arguing that councils are important in safeguarding democratic participation in the planning process . <p> " The problem is n't the small size of local government , it is the lack of overarching metropolitan governance . <p> " If we do n't start getting this right , instead of developing as ecocities , our cities will likely become steadily more stressful and dangerous 's Privacy Officer at **30;0;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> Q&amp;A : Aspiring to an ecocity future <p> Urban design , planning , building and maintenance must respond creatively , appropriately and effectively to the relationship between the social and the natural at both the local and global level . But how do the needs of countries differ ? <p> By Imogen Crump , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> The EcoCity World Summit is designed to focus on the way humanity builds its home -- its cities , towns and villages . Although the summit brings together a diverse mix of researchers , policy makers and citizens with a common focus on identifying and creating pathways to more sustainable , resilient and equitable cities ; the term ' ecocity ' itself can not be applied to one particular urban form . <p> The Cheonggyecheon Project in Seoul , Korea , revived a river that had been built over and it now helps to cool the city during summer . Picture : Wikimedia <p> This is because , according to the University of Melbourne 's Dr Dominique He s , each and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its history , its ecosystems and its climate -- making it difficult to have a single typology or model of the ecocity . A design needs to respond to the place and be as unique as that place . <p> We asked two experts attending the Summit in Melbourne , what the expectation of an ecocity is in their home country . <h> What is an ecocity in the context of your own country ? <p> Professor Brendan Gleeson , Director of the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute , University of Melbourne . <p> An ecocity in Australia is an ideal not a reality . Our cities are judged to be highly ' liveable ' by world standards , but this does n't tell us much about key qualities of ecological sustainability , including carbon emissions , climate preparedness and social justice . <p> For all major Australian cities , like Melbourne , heat stress is going to be a significant future factor . Picture : Alan <p> On these latter counts , Australian cities are failing badly . While we have some potentially powerful knowledge about how to shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , we need to be open to learning from other nations about how to advance towards the ecocity ideal , especially in the areas of just governance , social inclusion , cultural vibrancy and climate action . <p> In China , industrialisation and industrial effluents have contaminated ground water , polluting crops , diminishing biodiversity and affecting flora and fauna . Cities suffer from air , noise , solid waste and water pollution , compromising whatever quality of life economic growth has brought about . The past decades of capital , land and carbon intensive developments have made many Chinese cities among the most unsustainable settlements on Earth . <p> But the number of ecocities in China has grown over the years . One city , Shenzhen , has become a demonstration of a low-carbon ecocity . Shenzhen is a pioneer ecocity . In the last 30 years the population of this small border town has grown by more than 366 times , the size of the city has expanded by 18 times , and GDP has grown by 5,370 times . Today the 11-million ( some informal estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has set aside 44 per cent of its land as conservation areas , where no development will be allowed . <p> Professor Brendan are several priorities that require some focus to create sustainable urban centres . <p> One is transitioning our over-consumptive cities to low and preferably zero carbon entities , pushing back against the tide of social polarisation that is building here as it is in many world cities . This requires stronger governance of our cities . This does not mean more expert management , but democratic governances of their economies , societies and ecologies . <p> Professor Mee Kam Ng : Mindset is a big hurdle . Hong Kong , for example , has always been growth-oriented ; growth is regarded as good and progressive . But years of economic growth that comes at all costs has impaired people 's imagination when it comes to seeing different futures . However , this does not mean that we have not done anything . <p> Hong Kong has been growth-oriented for a long time , and is facing some real climate threats . Picture : Pixabay . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government - that are working hard towards sustainability . What we need is a way to integrate these efforts , identify the gaps and move forward with a consensus towards an economically vibrant , socially just and environmentally sound , ecological future . This is the essence of resilience . <h> What are the most important climate adaptation priorities for cities around the world ? <p> Professor Brendan our vast suburban landscapes for climate change and resource insecurity . We need a state-supported makeover which helps make these landscapes more resilient and less carbon intensive . <p> Our cities are going to be warmer , dryer , places with more extreme heat events and they 're going to experience sea level rise , so we need to move urgently to adapt those cities and make them resilient in the face of those changes . <p> Professor Mee Kam Ng : A priority has to be helping the less developed parts of the world as they have fewer resources . <p> Cities like Melbourne are going to be warmer and dryer , so planning needs to go into their resilience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires a vision that goes beyond ' mere growth ' - it is a challenge , an exploration and a learning process for people to live harmoniously with one another in nature in the long run . <p> Hong Kong 's move towards climate change is strongly affected by China 's efforts . The city is facing some real climate change threats . However , while the carbon intensity reduction target looks impressive , it is actually too modest for the city 's developed economy . To be a responsible global citizen and to pursue sustainable development , Hong Kong needs more concerted and comprehensive efforts to combat climate change . <h> What do you think are the key climate challenges that your part of the world will need to cope with in the future ? <p> Professor Brendan and rapidly growing cities are facing more weather extremes especially heatwaves . Looking at the bigger picture in terms of the cities , Perth has already arguably been quite heavily impacted by climate change , registering what appears to be a permanent decline in its annual rainfall and loss in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shanghai , suffer air pollution that impacts on quality of life . Picture : <p> For all of the major cities , one of the biggest issues is going to be heat stress and the increase in the number of extreme heat days in any given summer . <p> Professor Mee Kam Ng : We need to find a different way of producing , distributing and consuming our goods and services to lower greenhouse gas emissions . But we also need to address people 's preparedness to revisit the values and priorities of their lives ; meaning a fundamental re-conceptualisation of the relationships between ' economic growth ' and ' long-term development ' and challenging ' growth machine ' institutions to practise joined-up holistic thinking in the development process . <h> What will ecocities of the future be like for people living there ? <p> Professor Brendan Gleeson : I think the EcoCity Summit Principles for better cities give us a great steer on this question . These principles focus on four key areas : ecology , economics , politics and culture . <p> A really key change will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect our fragile natural and social ecologies . <p> Professor Mee Kam Ng : An urban living that respects nature and biodiversity . An urbanism that adopts the principle of biomimicry , this is when the design and production of materials , structures , and systems are modelled on biological entities and processes . It 's an urban setting that fosters rich human relationships ; as well as a diversified urban economy that nurtures and represents socio-spatial justice . <p> We will require a different breed of urban planner , planners who are determined to care about the environment , to learn from and design with nature so that urban development will evolve as part of the natural order rather than worsen pressing challenges such as climate change , serious flooding , global warming , 's Privacy Officer at **30;0;TOOLONG 
 <h> Podcast : How do we become an ecocity ? <p> CHRIS HATZIS Eavesdrop on Experts , a podcast about stories of inspiration and insights . It 's where expert types obsess , confess and profess . You 'll meet people who you would n't normally meet , but will be glad you did . I 'm Chris Hatzis . Let 's eavesdrop on experts and see how these 21st century explorers are changing the world ... one lecture , one experiment , one interview at time . <p> It 's an uncharacteristically beautiful sunny day in Melbourne and a great opportunity to escape from the office into an urban oasis -- Lincoln Square , a park just south of the University of Melbourne 's main campus . Even though we 're amongst the hustle and bustle of city life -- trams , commuters , buses and helicopters , there 's a certain tranquillity when coming down to the park to sit under the massive Moreton Bay fig trees . <p> Our reporter Dr Andi Horvath is here to have a chat with Dr Seona Candy -- an academic at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an expert in the importance of urban green areas . Seona is talking about food and water systems at the Ecocity World Summit in July 2017 -- a conference that will bring together councillors , academics and business to discuss how we can make our cities healthier , happier and more environmentally sustainable -- or , in Seona 's words , how we can create resilient cities . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH We 're sitting here on a picnic table in the middle of the city , and the city is Melbourne , Australia . There are helicopters going , you 're going to hear fire engines , there 's a bus stop just there and we 're in among a whole lot of high rises . Seona Candy , you 're someone who 's involved in this ecocity future , which means taking cities to a new sustainable and , in your words , resilient future . <p> DR CANDY At the moment , I 'm a research fellow in resilient urban systems , with a particular kind of interest and experience in food systems analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city is a complex thing . There 's lots of different systems and I think there 's a potential for these different systems to interact to make a city more resilient . So , for example , we have our urban gardens but we also have our peri-urban agriculture , for example . So it 's not just about community gardens and that kind of thing . Most - like the powerhouse of our food production comes from peri-urban areas . But what we also have to do in the city is we 've got issues with water , both not enough and too much at times , particularly with climate change coming on and all that kind of thing . We 've also got waste management which is a massive logistical exercise . So getting - I think there 's , what is it , something like 1.7 million households in Melbourne and every one of them has to get a bin emptied once a week . <p> But I see , particularly around the areas of food and water or even energy , that there 's so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slack and turn waste into something we can actually use . So the outputs of one system can actually be the inputs of another . So could we harness our stormwater and water our gardens ? Could we use our food waste , compost ? Could we use it for urban biogas to power our buses like they do in many other places ? I think there 's just so much opportunity . These initiatives , these I suppose sustainability initiatives , on their own in individual systems are all well and good , but often not considered feasible because - if they 're operating in isolation . But what I want to find out is , if you link them together , do they become more feasible because you 're taking the waste and you 're putting it in to something else . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH Now in 2017 in Melbourne is going to be a huge international conference about the ecocity . Is this the city of the future or the city of the now that we want to see happening ? Is this the discussion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , I think ecocity is probably a fairly broad term . It can mean a lot , a lot of things . Traditionally I suppose it 's - when people say eco , they think of environmental outcomes and they think of sustainability . But I suppose these days eco is not just about sustainability and maybe reducing our footprint , but it 's also about actually changing the structure of our cities to make us more adaptable , more resilient . So it 's not just about tinkering around the edges , an ecocity is about transforming cities . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH So what are your current research adventures ? What are you doing with some of your students ? <p> DR CANDY So I 'm working on two that are around - that are funded by the Cooperative Research Centre for Low Carbon Living , so they 're around low-carbon cities . One is called the Visions and Pathways project and it 's about bringing together stakeholders from the built environment area and bringing them together and trying to put together visions of what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually produced four separate visions . So they 're different , but all of these visions have seeds in the present . So at the moment now we 're working - we 've got the visions for 2040 but now we 're working on the pathways , what is it going to take to get us there . Another project I 'm working on is looking at - again , it 's a low-carbon city project . I 'm working with six students and we 're looking at urban interventions for low-carbon cities , but that also have implications for resilience . So a particular focus on distributed systems . <p> So in our cities we 've typically in history had centralised - you know , like our power is produced in one great , big power plant and trucked in , our water 's collected in one big damn and piped in , and all that kind of thing . But distributed network cities is where we actually start to either produce or gather or generate resources within our cities . So it 's this concept of what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . In cities , all the stuff that we need gets trucked in and we consume it and then our waste goes out . But what prosumers do is they actually produce some of the stuff that they consume . So this is whether we produce , to some extent , some of our own food if we have an urban garden ; not saying that that 's the solution to food security . Or do we collect some of our own rainwater , do we generate some of our own energy ? So to kind of offset the centralised systems that have historically supplied our cities . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH I 'm going to be the grumpy devil 's advocate , but is this too hard to do ? I mean there are companies out there that are just interested in profit , there 'd be body corporates that just go too hard , ca n't afford . There must be a dissenting voice . <p> DR CANDY Absolutely . I mean you - the uptake of rooftop solar has been amazing over the past few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually really interested in taking a bit back , taking control . There 's microgrids already popping up . These are the seeds of change that we 're looking for , this is for our pathways that are going to lead to better cities in the future . So there 's a microgrid on the outskirts of the city , say in Mooroolbark , which is - it 's grid connected , but it 's mostly just people sharing batteries , solar panels , all that kind of thing . So with new technologies coming in , we 've got to figure out ways to incorporate them into the social fabric of the city . So you ca n't just plonk a technology in there and expect it to work . So this is where the study of resilient urban systems is very much : a city is a socio , ecological , technological system . So it 's all these things intermixed and you ca n't deal with one and not incorporate the other . <p> So part of a resilient city is also building awareness in the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are interested in becoming prosumers and working out how these different systems can actually fit into their lives . Because there 's going to be some give and take on either side . Maybe the give or take just happens . So one of my students is doing a project where he 's looking for people , he 's setting up a simulated microgrid amongst groups of about six houses . So they each have a little in their house which tells them - it connects to their smart meter , it tells them how much they could - simulated - be producing in this microgrid that links all these six houses . But what he 's really looking into is , if these people have some awareness of the potential - and what they can see is in their microgrid , this simulated microgrid , whether they 're going over or under their allotted power or the power that 's available to them . <p> So then he wants to see if that will actually bring down consumption . So people actually being able to manage their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some of the highest energy use in the world and the highest carbon footprint in Australia per capita . So will this actually change that ? Because it 's got to come from both ends ; not just production , it 's got to come from consumption . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH I 'm ashamed for our fellow Australians , we 're going to have to get our act together . Okay , Seona , let 's start retrofitting some of the city here . We can see various style buildings , ranging back from the ' 70s , ' 80s , definitely some built this century , some really beautiful ones , colourful ones as well . We 're here in the middle of Melbourne , let 's start retrofitting , let 's fix things . Where do we start , Seona ? <p> DR CANDY Well , I would start looking at some of the older buildings and the older building stock for things like rooftop gardens . They 're particularly good because those buildings are typically over designed , so they 're strong enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I would see . Maybe these new apartment buildings that are less over-designed , I 'd want to see plants hanging over their balconies , vines growing up the side . It does n't have to be one of those amazing , but sometimes quite complicated , green fa ? ades . You can have vines growing up buildings . They have it - there 's a couple of - non-destructive vines . That green kind of skin , it would improve the urban heat island impact . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH Urban heat island ? <p> DR CANDY Yeah , so the urban heat island effect is basically when a city does n't cool down at night . We 've all experienced that on a hot summer 's day when the sun goes away but it 's still hot . This is because what happens in a city is that the sun comes down and it gets absorbed by all the concrete and whatever that we have in a city . Unlike in the country where it 's still hot during the day , but at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored heat in the area . So in the country it 's much cooler in the evening in summers that it is in the cities because all that heat can dissipate . What happens in the cities is that all that heat that 's stored in all the buildings and the roads and the concrete surfaces and all that kind of thing then starts to radiate back . So even when the sun 's gone away , it radiates between all these surfaces , so it never actually leaves the city and it stays hot . So then the next day when the sun comes out again , it just heats up even more . So it kind of builds and builds and builds on itself . That is a key problem , definitely in the city of Melbourne and many other cities that are in warmer climates , is this issue of urban heat island . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH So we 've got to take - be cool , literally . Alright , so we can fix our buses by giving them different fuels , we can fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'm making you emperor of Australia . <p> DR CANDY Laughs I definitely want to see more green spaces . Because that - it helps with a general wellbeing to have green spaces rather than just all concrete . Aside from that , it helps with this urban heat island effect because it 's one of these areas in a city that 's not going to store all that heat that 's going to make it really , really hot . It 's also really great for stormwater management . Green space , green area or permeable paving or whatever kind of water sensitive urban design features you put , it 's a - rain events are going to become shorter and sharper and so we 're going to have a lot of water to deal with . Anyone who 's been down the end of Elizabeth Street , near Flinders Street station in Melbourne , has seen what it looks like when there 's a serious rainfall event because there 's knee-deep water . Because that 's actually - Elizabeth Street used to be a river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural environment is saying , well actually , no , I 'm going to do what I want . <p> So this is where , like in this park that we 're sitting in now , Lincoln Square , the City of Melbourne has actually put in stormwater tanks underneath the park . So this is a way of stormwater storage to stop the problem happening down the bottom of Elizabeth Street . But also storing that water so that when it 's the middle of summer and they want to water this lovely green grass that we 're surrounded by , they can do it . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH Obviously retrofitting is a way to go with existing buildings . But what about design of new buildings or these so-called over-designed buildings that you referred to earlier ? <p> DR CANDY Yes , look , I think in the past they did n't have the sophisticated kind of analysis techniques that we have now . So they 'd put in a large sort of safety factor I suppose in the building of buildings . So they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that held the roof . But they erred on the side of caution and put more material into the building , which makes it stronger but I suppose less efficient when you 're building it . So now our newer buildings are more efficiently designed with less materials . But , as a result , they 're not strong enough to hold a rooftop garden . But I mean there are rooftop gardens on newer buildings . So there 's one on the new Cancer Centre on Royal Parade . There 's ways you can do it without putting loads of soil and causing your building to crumble . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH So next time we look at a city from a distance or a high-rise flat , what do you want us to think about ? <p> DR CANDY I want people to think about how they could be different . You know I want people to think about , oh what might that look like with greenery on the roof , what might it feel like inside ? There 's some amazing - there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a community , an apartment block , one of these older buildings who put a green roof . It 's amazing , it 's a beautiful space . I want them to see not just the challenges , I want them to see the opportunities . I think one of the common misconceptions around the area of sustainability and resilience and environmental impact is everyone thinks the changes that we have to make are going to be bad . Whereas I see the changes are going to be really - could be really good if we do them right . I see them as opportunities . An ecocity , a future city , is I think going to be better than what we 've already got . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH We need to get away from this helicopter , it 's following us , I 'm innocent . Seona , you mentioned social dimensions . Do you mean connecting us more together as humans and community ? <p> DR CANDY We have an amazing culture in our cities and we do n't want to lose that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can maintain our environment , we also need to maintain our culture at the same time . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH What are some of the misconceptions in the public that people have about sustainable or resilient cities ? <p> DR CANDY Look , I think people are scared of change in general . But I think they also assume that any changes we 're going to make for the good of the environment are going to be bad for the people living in it . Which , to me , it does n't have to be that way . I see actually the changes we can make will make our city better , a better place to live . I do n't know if any of you have seen that cartoon where there 's a guy standing up going , oh we 'll have clean energy , we 'll have water , we 'll have blah , blah , blah . Then someone - they talk about taking action on climate change and someone puts up his hand and says , what if it 's all a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's that kind of thing . All the changes we would make to make our city more sustainable and resilient will also just actually make it a better place . They 'll make it a better place if we bring the community along with it . Like I said earlier , you ca n't just dump a technology in an area , particularly not in a city which already has such a strong culture . You 've got to co-design solutions with the people who live in the city . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH Now if you 're wondering what that funny noise is , we 're kicking leaves here in another park . We 've just wandered over to Argyle Park here in the city of Melbourne . Seona I 'm really glad that you 're in charge of the future . I 've made you emperor of Australia . What 's the first thing you want us to get going on ? <p> DR CANDY I think the first thing we 've got to get going on - well kind of two parallel things - we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get the buy-in to make changes in a city . Because a city is not just about its infrastructure or its technology , it 's about its people . So that 's about I suppose getting people on board and showing them that change is for good , not for bad . Highlight all the opportunities and really support and nurture these seeds of change that I mentioned earlier , the seeds that could lead to a better future . So it 's community building exercises , but it 's also - it 's things where people are testing out urban biogas , are they putting it in to power buses , it 's food waste initiatives where there 's community composting . All sorts of things , these seeds of change . <p> This new - the Singapore bike share , the Singapore company that 's starting that new bike share . What 's it called ? The oBike or something like that . That 's a new initiative , it 's a new seed of change . It 's going to improve walkability , active transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at those seeds and look at them and analyse them and nurture the ones that we think are really going to bring positive change . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH You started off life as an engineer , a systems engineer . What good advice were you given by various mentors , or perhaps a book or a film ? Also I want to find out what good advice you give to your students . So let 's start with you , the early Seona Candy . <p> DR CANDY Look , I think I was a woman in a male-dominated profession . Early on I remember people saying to me , oh why are you working in that field , you 're never going to get a job . Then some wise person - I ca n't remember who it was - said to me , well , yeah , but if you 're doing something you really believe in and you really like , then you 're probably going to be quite good at it and then you 're probably going to get a job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of do n't let people stop you in your tracks . Everyone - that there are limitations , absolutely , to what - not everyone can do everything . But that 's the kind of thing , go well do n't let that put you off just yet . Another thing would be to get out of your comfort zone . So I think I did that a lot . Again , not everyone can do it to the extent that I did it by going into the Himalayas in Nepal or Lake Tonle Sap in Cambodia . But I think you can take a couple of risks here and there , get out of your comfort zone , try new things and that 's the way you learn and grow . <p> This is where this , again , links back to this seeds of change thing . There 's a whole movement in academia about the experimental city . Where we actually , instead of just sitting back and going , we 're not going to do that because it 's not going to work , we actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on a small scale and look at how - and if it works , that 's the way we learn . Even if it does n't work , that 's the way we learn . We learn what does and what does n't work . Then we look , if it works , okay let 's scale it up , let 's change it , let 's improve it , let 's spread it across the city . So it 's that experimentation that I think is going to be really important . We need to take a couple of risks . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH So that 's your advice to students really , experiment , take some risks and learn from it . <p> DR CANDY Look , it 's my advice to anyone who lives in a city or the people who are making decisions in a city . Try things on a small scale , see if they work , because that builds community , that brings people together to join the conversation around ecocities . Even if the thing you 're trying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building adaptive capacity in your city . <p> DR ANDI HORVATH Now you spoke about Australia having one of the highest energy uses . What is it with Australia , what 's going on ? <p> DR CANDY Well , it 's probably more around that we have one of the highest emissions per capita . So overall our emissions footprint is n't huge , but per capita it 's quite large . Part of that is that we have a very high-carbon lifestyle , so lots of car transport , we 've got lots of fossil fuel energy , all that kind of thing . If we 're going to I suppose change our cities for the better , we 've got to look at what 's going to reduce the carbon footprint of its citizens , and that takes good urban planning . <p> CHRIS HATZIS Excellent advice , Seona .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Changing the way we think about ecocities <p> The way we understand ecocities needs radical change in order to ensure a sustainable future , akin to our ancestors realising the earth was round <p> By Dr Dominique He s , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> To understand the concept of an ecocity it 's necessary to understand how it differs from a traditional city . An ecocity is one that is built with a clear comprehension of the principles of ecology and the environment , that are then incorporated into its design and functions . But importantly , it 's the ecological thinking that can change the way those who live in them think about conservation , ecological healing and their own contribution . <p> include all aspects of the city from its urban structure and design , its transport systems , as well as its energy , water , waste , money , data , ideas , history and its socio-economic potential . But it 's the people who live in the city that are critical to its success and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have people love and care for their place , it will foster custodianship , engagement and all sorts of innovative ways to make a city even greater . <p> Public Farm One by Work Architecture Company is an urban farming project displayed in New York . Picture : <h> Moving the ecocity beyond a concept <p> The concept of the ecocity is relatively new in urban design terms . Its origins can be traced throughout planning and city making -- and the concept itself has had many midwives along the way . <p> In 1898 , Britain 's Sir Ebenezer Howard founded the garden city movement which planned self-contained communities surrounded by greenbelts . In 1938 , American philosopher Lewis Mumford went further , emphasising what he saw as the organic relationship between people and their living spaces . <p> The list of contributors to the concept goes on ; Ian McHarg , Jane Jacobs , Rachel Carson and the Club of Rome 's Limits to Growth have had significant roles . The idea started to be formalised in 1987 when Richard Register published the book EcoCity Berkeley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , David Engwicht penned Towards An EcoCity , and in the early 1990s , the EcoCity summits began . <p> All of these designers , philosophers , scientists and researchers have influenced the ecocity 's current direction . And yet , despite all of this work there is still not an agreed definition ; just a goal , to create ecologically friendly developments for communities . <p> A green roof in Ontario helps manage water run off . Picture : Wikimedia <p> But the term ' ecocity ' itself can be a misnomer as it can not be applied to one particular urban form . This is because each and every place is unique -- its geography , its hydrology , its history , its ecosystems and its climate -- making it difficult to have a single typology or model of the ecocity . A design needs to respond to the place and be as unique as that place . So what drives the design and development , and retrofit of current cities , is the narrative around what an ecocity is . <p> The eco-city is an ecological city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment means , with the high level : Cities should have a deep and integrated relationship with should be based on an economy organized around social should have an enhanced emphasis on engaged and negotiated civic **26;0;TOOLONG should actively develop ongoing processes for dealing with the uncomfortable intersections of identity and difference , including the current tension between culture and nature . <p> New York 's streets opened up to people to walk and bike during Summer Streets . Picture : New York City Department of Transportation <h> The mindset to create an ecocity <p> If we describe the current thinking that got us into an unsustainable , ultimately annihilating , spiral of social and ecological degradation , as flat earth thinking ; then the round earth thinking is the ' a-ha ' moment when we see how the past approaches are not working and look for a new framework on which to base our decisions . <p> The ecocity research and principles hint at this , revealed by their call to work from an understanding of the ecology of place , to inform city design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecocity , our goals need to be much higher : we can do better than minimising our footprint , we can create a positive one . We can do better than zero carbon and become positive . We can do better than protecting biodiversity , we can create greater diversity . We can do better than ' living on a finite planet ' though true , energy is not finite , ideas are not finite , and many things we have contributed to the world through our cities add capacity and are not finite . <p> To do this , we need to shift our language from problem solving to potential creation through celebration and building on what already works . <h> Sustaining a new mindset <p> Our recent research on regenerative development and its application has pointed to the need to shift our mindset . This shift is backed by many leading thinkers . This is a world view that is ecological , living or whole-of-systems based ; a world view that is about benefit creation . <p> This is the round earth mindset of the the 21st century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition , integration not separation or segregation , about the contribution to the vitality , viability and potential of people and natural systems , not its consumption . It 's radical , yet it has the potential for an innovation explosion ; just as the realisation the earth was not flat and was not the centre of the universe sparked a change in thinking . <p> The aim of this new mindset is to shift design from the solving of problems to creation of potential through the creative synthesis that brings together all the parts and creates a greater whole . <p> It is design based on the key question : how can we best add value , create benefit and contribute to all people and systems on earth ? <p> A photovoltaic facade on a building in Rue des , Paris . Picture : Pascal Poggi <p> Cities hold the greatest potential for creating the benefit as they are a concentration of people , resources , money , innovation and diversity . Therefore , the ecocity , to achieve its aims and more , needs to start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future generations are better off . <h> the ecocity in practice <p> Regenerative development is " a whole systems approach that partners people and their places , working to make both people and nature stronger , more vibrant , and more resilient " . It brings together three steps that are worth considering in the development of an ecocity with an ecological world view . <p> The first is understanding the flows that work through a system that bring it to life . We then need design solutions that create multiple , mutual benefits between these flows by focusing on creating relationships , and finally , do all of this in context of the surrounding environment to ensure its relevance , resilience and ability to adapt . <p> But this is not just about improving production , more efficient processes , more environmentally friendly materials , elimination of waste , creation of green spaces or urban agriculture ; it is also about the meaningful engagement of everyone involved in the understanding of the issues and the design for the potential of their place . <p> The Acros building in Fukuoka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green spaces . Picture : City of Fukuoka <p> These are the two key contributions of regenerative development : the first is about creating capacity towards increased vitality and viability ; and secondly , it is as much about focusing on hearts , minds and spirit as it is about the technical and physical stuff . This means creating an irresistible narrative of a city . <p> Therefore , it 's community engagement and participation that is integral to the development of the ecocity . <p> Firstly , to build a shared vision that integrates common values while respecting different viewpoints . Secondly , we need to build the " capability and field of commitment " that enables everyone involved to act as both co-designers and future stewards . And thirdly , to stimulate the ongoing development and transformation of the community itself . <p> The positive thriving future that is possible for cities is not about a few heroes or governments fixing the problem , it is about everyone being empowered University 's Privacy Officer at **30;28;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> How caffeine helps premature babies breathe easy <p> Doctors have been using caffeine for pre-term babies since the 1990s , and new research shows the benefits last for years <p> By Kathryn Powley , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> There 's nothing like a good slug of caffeine to keep you on your toes , but it 's probably the last thing you 'd want to give to a baby . <p> Yet that 's exactly what doctors routinely use to stimulate breathing in premature babies . <p> Some of us might joke that we ca n't live without coffee , but that phrase is literally true for these littlest of babies . <p> Premature babies often need the help of a ventilator to breathe . Picture : Royal Women 's Hospital Melbourne <p> Caffeine has been given to pre-term babies since the 1990s and University of Melbourne Professor of Neonatal Paediatrics Lex Doyle and his colleagues have been keen to monitor the progress of those babies as they grew up . <p> Now they have published new research on the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 . They found that the caffeine caused the children no harm , and actually helped their breathing . <p> Professor Doyle , who works at the Royal Women 's Hospital in Melbourne , started caring for premature babies in the mid-1970s when caffeine-like medicines were just beginning to be used . They were caffeine-like because caffeine itself was not available for medical use back then . <p> " You might think it 's the same stuff they serve in Lygon St , and it is , but it 's in the medical form rather than a short black , " he says . <p> In his early career , ventilators were new and the outlook for premature babies was improving but had a long way to go . <p> Before ventilators were introduced in the 1970s , medical and nursing staff watched helplessly as many premature babies died because very little could be done help their breathing problems . <p> He says pre-term brains are n't wired the same way as a fully-developed babies , and this causes problems with their respiratory systems . <p> " If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over breathing that you would otherwise have . Preterm babies sometimes forget to breathe and do n't start again , " he explains . <p> But caffeine appears to stimulate those babies just enough to keep them going . <p> Professor Doyle says rather than keeping the babies awake -- they still sleep most of the time -- caffeine seems to " smooth out " the pauses in breathing . <p> " It does something to the baby 's brain . Part of our brain called the respiratory centre controls breathing . It does this automatically all the time . But in premature babies it 's not switched on as well as it should be . " <p> " Some of the babies were given caffeine , some were given a placebo , " Professor Doyle says . <p> The children were checked at 18 months and five years , and the group that received caffeine was found to have not been harmed . In fact those babies who had caffeine in their first weeks had significantly better breathing at age 11 than the control group . <p> This latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Critical Care Medicine , was conducted with partners at the Royal Children 's Hospital and the Murdoch Children 's Research Institute . It followed 142 children , all born weighing less than 1251 grams at birth . <p> " We found the caffeine group had better ability to get air out . Their lungs functioned better than those children who had n't had the caffeine , " says Professor Doyle . <p> He says this is likely because caffeine helps reduce lung injury by cutting time spent in ventilators in the early weeks after birth . <p> " If you are born very early , your lungs are not meant to be exposed to air . They 're supposed to be inside the uterus , filled with liquid , in a very low oxygen environment . <p> " When you 're born , you 're forced to breathe air or you die . But this is bad for your lungs if you 're a little baby . " <p> Pre-term babies breathe air that is often enriched with oxygen , either by themselves or with the help of a ventilator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lungs , so the sooner the baby can breathe effectively by themselves -- thanks to doses of caffeine over five or six weeks -- the better . <p> " It 's always a bit of a race to get the babies to breathe more and more by themselves . Most of them make it , and most survive . But some do end up with lung injury . It means as the children grow up , their breathing ability is not as good as it would be if they were born on time . " <p> Professor Doyle says just because caffeine is a life-saver for tiny babies does n't mean all babies would benefit from it . <p> " People think if a little is good , a lot must be better .

 <p> If you have seen the excellent near-future science fiction series Black Mirror , you will know the episode titled Be Back Soon . It tells the story of an avid social media user who dies tragically young , but who nonetheless is able to keep communicating with the love of his life , through social media . <p> Science fiction often anticipates technological development -- think of Arthur C. Clark and satellites , or William Gibson 's Neuromancer and data visualisation . And if the ambitions of the tech-behemoths Google , Apple and Facebook , together with a scattering of entrepreneurial start-ups are realised , Be Back Soon will join the list . <p> The ambition is no less than to offer individuals social immortality after biological death . <p> To achieve this with any degree of realism requires the integration of a number of types of software . Firstly , algorithms are needed to trawl through the entire digital production of a given individual -- all emails , Facebook posts , blog posts , tweets , Instagrams , Google searches , click-throughs , likes , re-postings -- anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attitudes and likelihood of expressing an attitude in any given case . <p> Secondly , while on this sweep , the characteristic language-style of the individual is mapped , ready for reproduction . These kinds of analyses are not a big step beyond the sophisticated algorithms already used by Google and Facebook to profile their users . Nor are they beyond the near-future capacity of big-data artificial intelligence text analysis algorithms . <p> Next , software is required that can parse and correctly interpret incoming personal and public digital communications -- personal emails and tweets , public news-services , shared Facebook pages and the like . <p> All this is combined so the individual can ' participate ' in a conversation , responding to and initiating posts , text messages and the like , in a manner that ' sounds ' like them . <p> A third component of this innovation -- more an optional extra than a necessity -- entails constructing a more sophisticated presence than that achieved through posts and text messages . The socially immortal might want to be represented through an authentic reproduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that developed by Lyrebird , or perhaps better still , visual or even virtual reality or holographic representations of a no doubt idealised body . <p> The development of these types of software is attracting billions of dollars in research funding . <p> Radical though it may seem , biological life and death have never entirely coincided with social life and death . The biologically dead have long continued to be active in the lives of the living through memory , or material legacy ; and the biologically living may be socially dead -- say , in a nursing home . <p> When so many of our contemporary social interactions occur online rather than in the flesh , the cultural foundation and infrastructure is clearly laid to widen the gap between social life and biological life , and relegate the body and its status as living or dead , to a social irrelevancy . <p> There are a number of services already offering the opportunity communicate beyond the grave .

In its original implementation these communications could be scheduled for distribution up to 999 years into the future - heroically assuming the company and the Digital Executor will be around for that time period . <p> Services like LivesOn rely on algorithmically generated communications rather than pre-recorded communication .

The product is some years from public launch but at the time of writing has attracted nearly 40,000 expressions of interest . <p> If these ambitions are realised and the social personas of the dead can keep acting in the world through the same platforms that maintain the social life of the living , they may be considered to be in some sense , socially alive .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Should Australia have a Bill of Rights ? <p> When considering the merits or otherwise of a bill of rights in Australia , there is much to learn from America 's constitutional amendments , even if there are newer models elsewhere <p> By Dr Scott Stephenson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> As issues such as the treatment of Indigenous children in detention , the recognition of same-sex marriage and the accommodation of religious minorities highlight , the protection of human rights in Australia is an immensely important and contentious subject . The treatment of these issues prompts us to consider whether Australia has an adequate system for the protection of human rights . <p> This raises the question : should Australia follow in the footsteps of most other liberal democracies and adopt a bill of rights ? <p> When we think about bills of rights , the US often comes to mind . Many people are aware of the First Amendment , which protects free speech , the Second Amendment , which protects gun ownership , and the Fifth Amendment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain silent . However , what we can learn from the US is often exaggerated or outright mistaken . <p> America 's Bill of Rights forms the first ten amendments to the country 's Constitution . Picture : Ted <p> In recent years , the world has turned away from the US for guidance on questions of constitutional design such as whether to have a bill of rights . In 2012 , the New York Times reported a study of two scholars finding that ' The US Constitution appears to be losing its appeal as a model for constitutional drafters elsewhere ' . <p> Australia is part of this trend . When the Australian Capital Territory in 2004 and Victoria in 2006 adopted a bill of rights , and when the federal government considered adopting one in 2009 , the most influential models were the newer bills of rights found in Canada , New Zealand and the UK , not the US . <p> Why , then , might we look to the US when we debate questions related to bills of rights in Australia ? <p> First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years old . While its age is often cited as one of the reasons for its declining influence ( why consider an older model when there are newer models on offer ? ) , this fact is highly pertinent for Australia . <p> Australia , like the US , has a Constitution that is very difficult to amend . If we were to include a bill of rights in the Constitution , it could prove hard to update , as has been the case in the US . The US demonstrates that the decisions we make about a bill of rights could last for many decades , if not centuries . <p> Second , the US Bill of Rights is significant . It has a profound effect on individuals , government , society and culture . For Australians , the experience of the US , more than any other country , helps envisage the potential changes a bill of rights could introduce . While the precise effects in Australia would differ , it is clear a bill of rights has the potential to be far more than a legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not we should seek to bring about such transformative change . <p> Third , the US Bill of Rights is distinct . Most of the newer bills of rights found in countries such as Canada , New Zealand and the UK were drafted to be different from the US model . They were designed to address some of the perceived problems with the US Bill of Rights and to allocate different sets of powers to the three arms of government . <p> If Australia were to adopt a variation of one of the newer models , it is important to understand what we would be trying to achieve -- and that can only occur if we also understand the older model . For example , the UK Human Rights Act , enacted in 1998 , is designed to give less power to the judiciary than the US Bill of Rights . It only makes sense to follow the UK 's lead if we decide that we also want to confer less power on the judiciary than in the US . <p> In recent years , the debate about a bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate about Indigenous recognition took centre stage . The two issues are not , however , completely separate . The proposal to insert a racial non-discrimination clause into the Constitution was opposed on the basis that it would amount to a " one clause bill of rights " . <p> When the debate arises again , it would be wise to remember that the US still has much to teach us about the promises and perils of a bill of rights . <p> The Honourable John G.

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Child stroke survivors have time on their side <p> The risk of children suffering a stroke is higher than you think , but new research is showing that with the right treatment the window for recovery is wide open <p> By Andrew Trounson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> A baby just a week old is three times more likely to suffer a stroke than an adult who smokes and suffers from diabetes and hypertension . <p> That makes stroke one of the top 10 killers of children , and we do n't know why . <p> But we do know that the window for recovering motor skills following brain damage from a stroke is open wider for children than for adults , and research at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute and the University of Melbourne is now finding out just how wide that window is . <p> Children have much more time to regain motor skills after a stroke , compared to adults . Picture : Pixabay <p> The results so far are good news , suggesting that victims keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit , when for an adult the potential for recovery is concentrated in a narrow window of just three-to-six months . But that means children need more monitoring and long-term rehabilitation . <p> The longitudinal study of 64 Australian child stroke victims could for the first time provide worried parents and their health practitioners more certainty on the outlook for children recovering from stroke . <p> " What these results suggest is that children need an individualised approach to their care and rehabilitation , which is guided in part by their age at the time of the stroke , and they need to have their progress monitored in the long term by a multidisciplinary team , " says lead researcher , occupational therapist and PhD student Ms Anna Cooper . <p> The ongoing study , published in US journal Pediatrics , focused on children who had suffered acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) , which is when the blood supply to the brain is constrained by an artery blockage such as a blood clot . Strokes can also be caused by a ruptured blood vessel . The risk of AIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days old , falling to 2-to-8 in every 100,000 in older children . <p> The researchers found that the children in the study were continuing to show signs of recovery 12 months on from the stroke . <p> For babies however the extent of any impairment was still emerging because before four months of age babies move largely by reflex . That means that any damage affecting motor skills may not be observable until they are older . <p> " Children are continuously developing and changing , and they are experiencing environmental and social changes in their lives that can all affect the trajectory of their recovery from stroke , " says Ms Cooper who is based at MCRI and the University of Melbourne , and works at the Royal Children 's Hospital . <p> The researchers are continuing to track the 64 children to further monitor their recovery trajectory and the factors that may influence it . <p> The children in the study , who had all been diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke , were recruited between December 2007 and November 2013 . Of these , 27 were aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 18 were school-aged . <p> Ms Cooper says the study will help shed light on how well babies recover from stroke compared to older children . In many cases , older children face having to relearn various motor skills impaired by the stroke . However in babies these skills wo n't have been learned before the stroke . <p> " A six year-old who suffers a stroke may have to be relearning how to walk , whereas a baby has to recover from an impairment that will affect their walking without knowing how to walk in the first place . So they may be having to learn from a compromised position . " <p> Researchers are still debating how babies ' recover from a stroke . <p> But alternatively being so young may help . Ms Cooper says there is debate over whether the greater " plasticity " of a baby 's brain , which makes it easier to adapt , may actually help them overcome a stroke impairment in learning motor skills compared to older children relearning those skills . <p> The results of the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plasticity and learned behaviour for recovery . <p> " They may be the age group where there is an optimal balance between greater brain plasticity and less vulnerability , " the researchers say in their paper . <p> Ms Coopers say she hopes the results will inform guidelines now being developed to better inform health practitioners and parents by giving them more idea of what sort of impairment they can expect to see in children as they grow , and what their trajectory for recovery is likely to be . <p> " At the moment , when a child has a stroke we ca n't tell the parents what is going to happen in terms of motor function because it is really unclear .

 <p> But not so long ago , surgeons were called ' sawbones ' and patients were told to literally bite on a bullet to silence their screaming .

The Second World War saw further advances including airway management , artificial ventilation and the administration of pain therapies to thousands of wounded . <p> Professor David Story , Foundation Chair of Anaesthesia at the University of Melbourne , says that , by 1950 , the fundamentals of modern anaesthesia were in place . <p> " The drugs we use today are in essence the grandchildren or great-grandchildren of those used back in the 1950s , " Professor Story explains .

As well as physically observing the patient during surgery , we use technology to monitor their vital signs such as blood pressure , blood oxygen levels , heart rate and breathing patterns . <p> " We 've seen huge improvements in safety over the past 30 years , with the death rate from general anaesthesia dropping from about one in 20,000 in the 1970s to one or two in every 200,000 today . " <h> Contemporary challenges <p> Australians are living longer but they are sicker , which means that patients undergoing surgery often present with co-morbidities -- they have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more additional diseases or disorders like diabetes and high blood pressure . <p> " But anaesthetists are increasingly good at recognising these risks and dealing with them one by one . Before a procedure , we meet with a patient to discuss their lifestyle and medical history , which helps us in assessing their individual risk factors and personalising a care plan for before , during and after surgery , " says Professor Story . <p> Anaesthesia has become one of the safest routine medical procedures . Picture : iStock <p> " Smoking is a good example : if we know a patient is a smoker , we can encourage them to cut down two weeks before the surgery and this also cuts down their risk of infection . " <p> Obesity is another example . Professor Story and fellow researchers have recently published The Mum Size Study on caring and planning for obese women giving birth by caesarean . <p> A collaboration between seven Victorian hospitals affiliated with the University of Melbourne and led by specialist obstetric anaesthetist Associate Professor Alicia Dennis , the study looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in total theatre time , surgical and anaesthesia time and increased risk of intensive care unit admission . <p> " We propose a new classification of body mass index at delivery that takes into account gestational weight gain so women are correctly classified at caesarean section , helping us anticipate extra time in theatre and modified clinical monitoring in the perioperative period , " says Professor Story . <p> " The results of the study should inform health policy and assist with the development of interventions targeted at young women prior to pregnancy . " <h> The mystery of consciousness <p> Another challenge yet to be solved is exactly how anaesthesia works . One hundred and seventy years after William Morton used ether during his public demonstration , just how these drugs render a patient unconscious remains a mystery . <p> " There is still a lot we do n't know about the human brain and consciousness . But our current understanding is that intravenous anaesthetic drugs target receptors for neurotransmitters -- brain chemicals that transmit signals between nerve cells -- particularly one called GABAA , which sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathway is blocked , arousal signals are inhibited and sleep is induced . However , the gas anaesthetics have a broader effect on brain cells . " <p> But achieving this low level of brain activity is a fine balance -- too much anaesthetic could adversely affect the brain while too little could result in the patient feeling the cut of the scalpel and regaining consciousness mid-surgery ; a rare but deeply distressing event . Until technology is created that can better monitor consciousness , medicine must continue to rely on the experience , compassion and skills of anaesthetists . <p> Which begs the questions : why is it always surgeons playing the rock star on TV ?

 <p> Stephanie Liddicoat is doing just that . The University of Melbourne PhD student is about to submit her thesis Architecture and the Design of Therapeutic Environments and is set to shake up how architects , counsellors and therapists think about designing the places and spaces where therapeutic treatment is carried out . <p> Ms Liddicoat , who is based in the Faculty of Architecture , Building and Planning , found that many of the spaces currently being used for counselling are problematic and makes a series of recommendations for change . <p> Frustrated by the lack of practical design guidelines for therapeutic areas in places like consulting rooms , hospitals and schools , Ms Liddicoat spoke to therapists , architects and most importantly , to people who were actually having therapy , about how therapeutic spaces should be laid out . <p> She was surprised by the high degree of self-awareness among those undergoing therapy and the extent to which they knew what was best for them when it came to the design of counselling rooms . <p> She was disturbed to find that buildings were being used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview she was told therapy sessions were held in what used to be a janitor 's closet . <p> " So you can image it was completely internal . There was no window and people were sitting almost knee to knee , ' ' she says . " It was not a space that was therapeutic and certainly not helpful or empowering when you are trying to recover from something . " <p> She found that people in therapy prefer not to be in a windowless room , as they often seek escape and respite in a view . Nor did they feel comfortable when the therapist 's chair was higher than their own or made from better quality materials , indicating an imbalance of power . <p> They wanted greenery that reduced stress and soft finishes rather than hard , resistant surfaces that would leave signs of the person who had preceded them in the counselling room . <p> Therapy spaces should feature soft materials , and the furniture should not imply a power imbalance . Picture : Stephanie Liddicoat <p> " People having counselling do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them . They would be thinking ' someone has been in this space before me . They have spoken about their traumatic experience ' , " says Ms Liddicoat . <p> This was not helpful for the person undergoing therapy . They wanted to feel comfortable enough to talk openly and freely about their problems without reverting to platitudes that concealed their true feelings . And they did not want to be prompted to think about what may have troubled the person who had sat in the same chair before them . <p> They also wanted to feel they were worthy of a pleasant environment which made them feel validated . Spaces that were prison-like implied abnormality , punishment or an inability to escape , mentally or physically . <p> Ms Liddicoat also found the greatest support for her research came from therapists , carers and counsellors , but less so -- somewhat surprisingly -- from fellow architects . <p> " The general reaction of therapists has been ' yes of course it makes a difference . I wish I had an idea of how to lay out my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more comfortable ? How can I avoid taking over the space ? ' <p> " The architects were less compassionate , arguing that their training and expertise in design and policy made them the better , more reliable experts , than the person undergoing therapy themselves . " <p> Through her research Ms Liddicoat sought to understand why it was that a person could walk into a room and immediately feel relaxed and calm -- or vice-versa . <p> " It all started with the idea that the buildings we inhabit can change how we feel and that captured my imagination as an architect but also as a researcher , particularly with its application in the field of design for mental health , " she says . <p> Prison-like spaces , with hard surfaces and no windows , are particularly inappropriate for people with mental illness .

When she was an undergraduate she looked at how she could design better counselling rooms for women who had undergone treatment for breast cancer . <p> " One of the key drivers was trying to understand their vulnerability , how their bodies had changed , often quite dramatically , and how that affected their identity as women , " she says . <p> " I thought about how I could design a space that would actually make them feel better . That got me interested in the idea that there is a mental wellbeing component in buildings . " <p> Modifying spaces to be better suited for counselling is not complicated or expensive and the ideas can be applied in hospitals , schools , facilities for the elderly or anywhere else with a similar purpose , for example counselling for vulnerable or marginalised people , cultural minorities , people with physical disabilities and those from non-conformist gender groups . <p> " Possible changes are quite simple and easy to do and can make a real difference . So a therapist might be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they can use them to adjust their own therapeutic space , she says . <p> This can lead to counselling services becoming less costly , she says .

It 's about how many of the people using the services are repeating less . Are they becoming self-sufficient ?

 <h> Pursuit home <h> ' Rusty ' brains linked to Alzheimer 's <p> The discovery that high iron levels in the brain can lead to the onset of the devastating disease may pave the way for a treatment <p> By Andrew Trounson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Cleaning out ' rust ' from the brain could be a way to slow and even prevent the degenerative disease Alzheimer 's , according to new research that pinpoints iron as its so-far elusive potential driver . <p> Previous research has long linked Alzheimer 's to a build-up in amyloid protein fragments in the brain that are normally broken down in healthy brains . But efforts to treat Alzheimer 's by using drugs that reduce amyloid levels have so far failed , leading to speculation that something else is driving the disease . <p> New research from the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health and the University of Melbourne has found that iron might be the culprit . Iron has a special property that allows it to exchange electrons , which is crucial in allowing our bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it can also damage neurons in the same way that iron metal rusts in the presence of oxygen . <p> A stylised image of a brain MRI using Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping ( QSM ) showing in red the increase in iron levels found in those with Alzheimer 's pathology compared to controls . Picture : Supplied <p> The researchers used cutting edge magnetic resonance imaging techniques to measure iron levels in the brain . They found that people with high levels of iron in combination with high levels of amyloid were suffering rapid cognitive decline , but that people with high levels of amyloid but low levels of iron in the brain , were stable . <p> They are now going to carry out a five year trial to test whether an anti-iron drug can slow the progress of Alzheimer 's , in what would be a major breakthrough in finding a treatment . <h> Brain can corrode like metal rusts <p> " Given the data from our study , it seems reasonable to hypothesise that lowering iron in the brain would slow the progression of the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is what we are now going to do , " says lead researcher on the study Dr Scott Ayton , who is based at the Florey Institute and the University of Melbourne . <p> Dr Ayton cautions that the amount of iron in a person 's brain appears unrelated to their iron intake or iron levels in the blood . People therefore should n't be cutting down on iron in response to these results . It also means that levels of iron in the blood are n't an indicator of Alzheimer 's risk . <p> " We do n't have any evidence that the amount of iron you eat , or the amount that is measured in your blood , has any impact on the amount of iron in your brain , so we are not recommending people change what they eat based on our research , " Dr Ayton says . <p> Indeed iron is important in generating energy , but Dr Ayton says it is also a double-edged sword as it can cause cell death , including the death of neuron cells in the brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , the by-product is oxidative stress , which is similar to rust that deteriorates metal . <p> " The rusting you see on iron metal is the same rusting reaction that occurs in the brain , " Dr Ayton says . <p> " Iron and oxygen are very dangerous elements that biology has exploited to efficiently produce energy . But the characteristics that make iron such a useful element are the same that make it incredibly toxic . " <h> Hunt for another lesion <p> The hunt for an alternative driver of Alzheimer 's gained momentum when the same Institute research group published a study in 2013 that found that among a group of participants aged over 70 with high levels of amyloid , about 30 per cent had no symptoms of dementia such as memory loss and falling cognitive function . Alzheimer 's disease is the leading cause of dementia . <p> " Amyloid build up is clearly important in Alzheimer 's . If you have high levels of amyloid in the brain then you are likely to get Alzheimer 's , but we just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of lesion in the brain is required for an individual to move from having the underlying pathology of the disease , i.e. amyloid build up , to the degenerative state of dementia , " explains Dr Ayton . <p> Advances and refinements in techniques of Magnetic Resonance Imaging have made possible to pin point iron levels in the brain . Picture : Leon <p> The research team was further encouraged to target iron after they found that high levels in brain fluid were correlated with symptoms of dementia . But it is only thanks to recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques that they have been able to monitor actual levels of iron in the brain . <p> With the help of scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation , Dr Amir Fazlollahi and Dr Olivier Salvado , the research team was able to refine the Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping ( QSM ) MRI technique to image iron deposits in the brain . <p> They recruited 117 participants of whom 56 had elevated levels of amyloid as measured by PET scans ( positron emission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron levels . Over a period of six years they tracked these people 's cognitive function . They found that elevated iron in combination with elevated amyloid was strongly correlated with rapid cognitive decline . <p> The decline was further correlated with the location of the iron build up in the brain . A high level of iron in the hippocampus , which stores short-term memory , was correlated with memory decline . Similarly , high levels of iron in the temporal and frontal lobes , associated with language , were correlated with poor performance in language tasks . <p> The researchers now plan to test anti-iron drug on a cohort of Alzheimer 's patients . Deferiprone is known to reach the brain and there is early clinical evidence that it is effective in slowing Parkinson 's , a neurological disease that leads to movement disorders and is also associated with brain iron . <p> " These results for Deferiprone in Parkinson 's are what have really encouraged us to test the same drug on Alzheimer 's , " says Dr Ayton . <p> Senior researcher on the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if reducing brain iron is shown to be effective it could lead to a routine treatment for Alzheimer 's . <p> " If the trial results prove that low brain iron slows disease progression , we imagine a future where your GP sends you off for your 60-year health check , including a brain iron MRI scan , which is quick , cheap and painless , " says Professor Bush . " If you have high brain iron , then we would order an amyloid PET scan . <p> " Once we had those two measurements , we could predict the likely onset of Alzheimer 's and begin therapy to lower the iron , and delay disease onset .

" <p> He defines civil society as " non-state institutions that are crucial to sustaining modern democratic participation .

Picture : Wikimedia <p> " Social movements are very active , dynamic and grass . They represent voices to the policy makers in a democratic society . Okinawa itself has had a peace movement since 1945.

As part of Japan 's modernisation process , over the last 100 years , Okinawa has been assimilated into Japanese society . I understand the people 's frustrations . <p> " But on the other hand , geo-politically , it makes sense for Japan to maintain US military bases in the South China Sea . " <p> Professor Ogawa argues these conflicting interests are amplified by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 's approach to free speech and discourse . <p> " The Abe government is very problematic as it oppresses marginalised people . The administration has been moving to a more nationalistic policy-making apparatus , ignoring grass-roots voices , " he says . <p> " They do n't change anything . People in Okinawa are really angry . The Japanese government is ignoring this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by US military go to a US court and it 's not an issue for the Japanese government . That 's also why the peace movement in Okinawa has never really ended . " <p> Professor Ogawa , who was a journalist at Kyodo News for five years before moving into academia , also says alternative media is needed to discuss this situation properly . <p> " Major media do n't cover it . The Japanese people need to have access to material from independent , conscientious journalists . " <p> By noting these interactions between government , foreign influences , media and citizen groups , Professor Ogawa admits it is ironic but fitting that Western models of protest are being mobilised against a long-standing US military presence . <p> " Civil society and social movements are very strong in Okinawa , perhaps because there have been military bases there on and off for 70 years , " he says . <p> " It 's about not passively accepting a current situation .

But there is no risk at all , " says Professor Lewin . <p> She says misconceptions , stoked by emotion and fear , drive the stigmas that are so often attached to people living with infections such as HIV . <p> " To lose that emotional reaction you have to understand and trust the evidence , " she says . " That is why science literacy is so important in understanding how it is we come to conclusions on what is safe or unsafe , and then trust the science . But I think in science we still have a long way to go in better communicating these messages . " <p> She notes that in healthcare it has been recognised that exposure to blood puts people at risk of many potential blood-borne diseases , not just HIV . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same when it comes to safety . The approach has also been adopted in sport where , under the blood rule , players bleeding from an injury must immediately seek treatment off the field . <p> " To a healthcare worker it should make no difference if a person is HIV positive or not because we treat all blood as infectious and take the necessary precautions , " Professor Lewin explains . <p> The risk of contracting HIV is limited to infection through unprotected sex and or by blood exposure such as sharing needles or having a blood transfusion . According to the US Centre for Disease Control , the risk of HIV infection from a needle stick penetrating the skin is just 23 out of every 10,000 people , or 0.23 per cent . <p> Blood is the inaugural exhibition of the University of Melbourne 's Science Gallery Melbourne -- part of the world-wide Science Gallery International network of university-linked galleries that are dedicated to promoting public engagement with art and science .

That is the approximate number of infection-fighting white blood cells in a single drop of blood in someone with a white blood cell count . Viewers of the work are invited to take away the white pebbles in a symbolic representation of the falling white blood-cell count that cancer patients suffer when they undergo chemotherapy . <p> The work was inspired by Mr Elborne 's own mother 's fight with cancer , and the pebbles can only be taken in exchange for a donation to the National Breast Cancer Foundation . <p> One Drop of Blood , Dan Elborn .

Ritualistic ideas around sharing blood , such as in the idea of blood brothers or the Christian ritual to symbolically share Christ 's blood , have in a sense been realised in the form of blood transfusions and blood donations . <p> " Through thousands of years of cultural practice and art we have always known how important blood is , " says Mr Walton , who lectures at the Victorian College of the Arts and Melbourne Conservatory of Music at the University of Melbourne and was also on the selection panel for Blood . <p> " The mystery of blood prefigures the scientific discoveries , and those mysteries have proven to be in many ways true . <p> " Blood is something that we share with others , it is something that can give life to others , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it holds our genetic inheritance , " says Mr Walton , whose own core art practice is as a director of experimental theatre and live art . <p> He says our reaction to blood is fascinating because it both repulses us and connects us . He suggests that the sight of blood disturbs us partly because we are accustomed to thinking of ourselves as separate and sealed off from the world and others . But when we bleed we are graphically reminded of our own bodies and our vulnerability . <p> " Our cultures sometimes make us forget that we are part of the animal kingdom , and make us think that we are detached from our bodies . But when blood spurts out of a wound it becomes the liquid that connects us to the outside world , and it is horrifying . We imagine our life trickling away , " he says . <p> Recyling - Bao Yiluo .

The empathetic powers of blood , he says , have been famously explored by such performance artists such as Franko B , Ron Athey , Kira O'Reilly , and Marina Abramovic who have purposely made themselves bleed in front of a close-up audience . <p> " When we see someone bleeding it creates a huge amount of empathy when we realise that like us , blood courses through another being 's veins . The reality of inhabiting a fragile , bloody body , connects us , " he says . " And then that awareness can prompt us further to think of the bigger picture , and how all creatures are connected .

 <p> Hip Hop culture and Rap ( a method of vocal delivery popularised through Hip Hop music ) has for more than four decades been bundled with a range of negative connotations , leading many like Commissioner Bratton to equate Hip Hop culture only with profanity , misogyny , violence and crime . Prosecutors in the US have labelled Rap lyrics a criminal threat , and numerous studies have been undertaken on the harmful influence of Hip Hop on kids . The impacts of this perception remain palpable . <p> Melbourne-based Hip Hop artist Mantra ( above ) works extensively in schools and the community to empower youth . Picture : courtesy of Michelle Grace **27;0;TOOLONG <p> There 's no denying that the lyrical content of Hip Hop music is confronting , and in many instances includes the glorification of violence , substance use , and gender discrimination . But while many people struggle to look past the profanity , materialism and high-risk messages often celebrated within mainstream Rap music , Hip Hop culture at its core , is built on values of social justice , peace , respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is because of these core values that Hip Hop is increasingly being used as a therapeutic tool when working with young people . <h> The perfect music therapy <p> School counsellors , psychologists , and social workers have helped to normalise the option of integrating Hip Hop within mental health strategies . In fact , it has become central to the work of one group of psychiatrists at Cambridge University , who under the banner of " Hip Hop Pysch " , use Hip Hop as a tool in promoting mental health . Some have even called Rap " the perfect form for music therapy . " So what is going on ? <p> Hip Hop culture , while born in New York City , is now a worldwide phenomenon . You would be hard-pressed to find any country that does n't have some kind of Hip Hop scene . This new reality is driven by two factors .

At its simplest , you can make a beat with your mouth -- beatboxing -- or on a school desk , and create or recite lyrics about anything without singing . The proliferation of cost-friendly music creating software and hardware puts more involved participation in reach , and allows flexibility in creativity and even pathways to entrepreneurship . <p> Marginalised communities the world over resonate with the ethos of resisting exclusion or discrimination and fighting for equity and justice . Others just love the beats and lyrical flow . Beyond beats and rhymes , there 's also something for everyone , B-Girls and B-Boys dance , DJ 's scratch and mix , and Graffiti artists draw and write .

It 's a style most young people feel comfortable with and it provides a way to build rapport and initiate a client-therapist relationship . The reflective nature of the lyrical content is a vehicle for building self reflection , learning , and growth . Whether analysing existing songs , or creating new content , the vast array of themes found in Hip Hop lyrics provide therapists access to many topics that are otherwise hard to talk about . <p> Finally , the repetitive and predictable nature of Hip Hop beats are said to provide a sense of safety , particularly during song writing , and lyrical and musical improvisation . Therapists suggest this provides a sense of dependability for those with little regularity or safety in their everyday lives ; something supported by research linking music engagement and self-regulation . <p> US Hip Hop artist Kendrick Lamar ( above ) is an active advocate for social justice , with lyrics that tackle racism , violence and police brutality .

Many communities around the world still battle the deleterious effects of discrimination , segregation , and injustice . Hip Hop is often a potent voice to these lived experiences . This remains one reason why the lyrical content still contains these themes .

 <h> How attitudes disable <p> VOICEOVER This is Up Close , the research talk show from the University of Melbourne , Australia . <p> LYNNE Hi , I 'm Lynne Haultain and welcome to Up Close . The way we understand disability has changed dramatically in recent decades , but according to our guest Eric Emerson , there are still some serious assumptions to be broken . The relationships between poor health , disability , and poverty are being revealed in data in many parts of the world . And with that , comes some challenges to government policy and more than that , to common perceptions about what disability is . <p> The way we understand disability means we are making all sorts of assumptions about health , well-being , and capacity which effectively marginalise people and perpetuate the problems . There 's evidence to show that not only disability can result in poverty , but that poverty increases your chance of disability . What can be done to break that nexus ? <p> Professor Eric Emerson is a pre-eminent researcher in disability health , emeritus professor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia at the University of Sydney . He 's in Melbourne for the launch of the Centre of Research Excellence in Disability and Health at the University of Melbourne , and we 're delighted to have him join us for Up Close . <p> ERIC EMERSON Thank you . <p> LYNNE Let 's talk about what disability is and what it is n't , Eric . <p> ERIC EMERSON I guess there are really two components to being disabled or having a disability . The first is that you have to have a significant health condition or impairment . <p> LYNNE That 's physical , intellectual . <p> ERIC EMERSON Physical , mental . Of course , many of us have long term physical or mental health conditions or impairments . I have - you ca n't see on the radio but if you were here you 'd see that half my face is paralysed , and that 's a long-term impairment , but I 'm not disabled . <p> The second component - and that 's what really , disability is about , is that you also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society in some kind of important and meaningful sphere , whether it 's civic participation , economic participation , which is related to your health condition or impairment . <p> The health condition or impairment is something which is personal , something that is part of you . The disability arises from the interaction between that health condition and impairment and the society in which you live . <p> LYNNE It 's not who you are ; it 's what happens to you ? <p> ERIC EMERSON Absolutely . I 'm not disabled because having a face in which only half works is n't a problem in the society in which I live ; it 's never been a problem for me . Imagine if I was living in a society in which people felt that - had a cultural belief that those people whose faces did n't work well was a sign of evil , then I would be disabled in that society . Or , if I was living in a society in which facial expressions were really , really important in communication . They are important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communication , then I 'd be struggling . <p> It would be the kind of cultural beliefs or expectations etcetera need to be specific and interact with the health condition or impairment that the person has , that creates this problem of living in that society . It means people get excluded - socially excluded because of their health condition , not because the health condition does it but because the cultural expectations , the way society works , means that they are being excluded . <p> LYNNE We do it to them ? <p> ERIC EMERSON Absolutely . <p> LYNNE Society creates the construct in which this is declared disability , and that 's not . <p> ERIC EMERSON Absolutely , and there 's a very interesting debate within disability internationally in terms of whether you talk about people with disabilities , or whether you talk about disabled people . In the UK , disability activists will talk about disabled people ; people who have been made disabled by society and think that talking about people with disabilities suggests that the disability is inherent within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about people with disabilities . <p> There 's an interesting difference in the way we talk about these things which gives slightly different messages . <p> LYNNE And goes to , I suppose , the challenge to this understanding of disability which has ramped up over the last 30-odd years with disability activists as you describe . <p> ERIC EMERSON Absolutely . <p> LYNNE What kind of in-roads have they made in the understanding of the way in which we comprehend disability ? Do you think that 's much clearer now ? <p> ERIC EMERSON I think it is for many people ; I think it is for many important institutions like governments , it is on an international scale in relation to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which clarifies what disability is and what it is n't . I really do n't think that understanding that disabled is done to people by society , has got through to kind of lay understandings of disability . I think many people - many professions still seem to see disability as just i 'll health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - public health , that 's the primary way that people think about disability ; it 's i 'll health , is n't it ? These are just i 'll people . <p> LYNNE Let 's talk about health because that 's another dimension to this . You 've got extensive research to demonstrate that there is poorer health in people with impairments and who are disabled to use the English terminology . It does n't necessarily relate to their underlying condition ? <p> ERIC EMERSON No . <p> LYNNE You 've got people who have mental health conditions or intellectual health conditions and disability , but who have high blood pressure or diabetes which does n't necessarily connect in any way with their disability . What 's going on there ? We 've got poorer health but not in the ways that necessarily connect with the impairment . <p> ERIC EMERSON Sure , clearly there are some instances in which the poorer health of people with disabilities is connected to their impairment . For example , we know that children with Down Syndrome are at higher risk of congenital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . All the evidence suggests that 's about Down Syndrome , there 's something about the chromosomal abnormality which creates Down Syndrome which also does this . <p> Sometimes the poorer health of people with disabilities is related to their impairments , but I guess the puzzling thing is that for a lot of people , the poorer health cuts across so many different aspects of their lives that it 's difficult to understand any biological mechanisms or processes which link the impairment to poor health . Why should people who have difficulty understanding and communicating of it have such higher rates of mortality , of poorer mental health etcetera ? <p> That 's been one of the puzzles , why do people who have difficulty with relation to mobility have poorer mental health ? It does n't seem to be related in a physical way to their impairments . That 's one of the kind of things that we 've been looking at for a decade or more now , and I guess we 've come to the position of thinking that the primary factor which is driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with their impairment at all . It 's about the disadvantage they face in the world into which they are born , grow up , work , live etcetera . <p> It 's the disadvantage faced by people with disabilities which really generates and creates their poorer health . It 's not about impairment ; it 's about being disabled . It 's about being marginalised and disadvantaged in the society in which you live . We see poorer health amongst other marginalised and vulnerable groups , amongst economic migrants , amongst Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander people . This is about the effects that society have on marginalising people and damaging their health . <p> LYNNE Would you equate disability with disadvantage ? <p> ERIC EMERSON Absolutely . Impairment , that 's one thing , but the disability that people face is about disadvantage . It is about social exclusion , then it 's about marginalisation , and we know that socially excluded and disadvantaged and marginalised groups around the world have poorer health . People with disabilities are one of those at-risk groups . We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy and practice . <p> LYNNE Let 's have a look a bit more closely at what happens with people with disability . Lower incomes , lower family incomes , greater financial insecurity , possibly lower education attainment ; is that the sort of picture that we 're creating ? <p> ERIC EMERSON Yeah , absolutely . In a sense , it starts from birth ; it starts before birth because people born into more disadvantaged circumstances are more likely to acquire impairments that are associated with disability in the society in which they 're living . <p> ERIC EMERSON No , that 's saying that poverty creates impairments , which is separate - it 's a separate issue but for many of the impairments that are associated with disability in certainly an Australian society or British society or virtually any other society , most of those impairments which are associated with disability , tend to be more common amongst people living in poorer circumstances , and particularly amongst children growing up in poorer circumstances . <p> LYNNE Like ? <p> ERIC EMERSON Developmental delay , intellectual disability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between exposure to adversity in childhood prenatally , and the risk of acquiring a developmental delay . <p> LYNNE Deafness for example ? <p> ERIC EMERSON Deafness , absolutely . Some of the areas in which you see really strong relationships are deafness and all the intellectual and cognitive problems that children may acquire . Dyslexia is a very strong relationship between exposure to adversity in childhood and the probability of acquiring dyslexia . <p> It does n't mean that everybody who has dyslexia has an adverse childhood at all , but it just increases the risk . <p> LYNNE Eric Emerson is Professor of Disability Population Health at the University of Sydney , and today on Up Close we 're exploring the way we understand disability and the links with poor health . I 'm Lynne Haultain . <p> Eric , we have people with impairments who will feel marginalised and become disabled ? <p> ERIC EMERSON Yep . <p> LYNNE We have people who are growing up in socially disadvantaged environments and are more likely to become impaired and disabled . How do you break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMERSON I guess you really need to look at the different pathways that lead from impairments through disadvantage through to disability which requires unclear disadvantage . For example , we know that growing up in adverse circumstances increases the risk of cognitive delay , developmental delay . We know that if you go to school with a developmental delay and not as good at language as other kids and not as good ability to concentrate as other kids ; you 're not going to get the best out of the educational system . We know that if you leave school with poorer qualifications you 're not going to do well in the labour market , you 're more likely to be unemployed etcetera . <p> It 's identifying those pathways which kind of run through life and thinking , well what can we do at different stages to intervene effectively , and especially to target those children , those families , those individuals who are at most risk . <p> LYNNE If we 're talking about the disadvantages of housing , nutrition , income , family security , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see higher levels of disability and that kind of marginalisation in poorer socio-economic countries ? <p> ERIC EMERSON We do . There 's been a huge amount of work over the last decade or so , primarily led by the World Health Organisation to try and understand why we see such huge differences in life expectancy for example from childhood , childhood life expectancy , childhood under five survival rates , child development , why we see such huge variation between countries around the world and within countries around the world . <p> We do see staggeringly large differences in , for example , the chances of child surviving to age five around the world . The poorer the country , the higher the risk . In rich countries , it 's slightly different , but there 's a very , very strong relationship . The same appears to be the case for disability as well . Disability is one of those things that health researchers have largely ignored , so I guess the quality of the information is n't as good as we 'd hope . <p> For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the extent to which children under five have significant levels of developmental delay . The rates that we 're seeing in the world 's poorest countries are far , far higher than the rates we see in the world 's richer countries ; staggeringly high , 30 to 40 percent of children using the same measure appear to have significant developmental delay in the world 's low-income countries , compared with 0.1 or 0.2 per cent . <p> LYNNE That 's extraordinary . <p> ERIC EMERSON Yes , and there 's been some really good work done trying to estimate how many million children under five fail to realise their developmental potential . The numbers are always a bit flexible , but we 're talking 250-500 million children a year , and they are nearly living in the world 's poorest countries . <p> LYNNE Now , Eric , I 'd really like to spend a bit of time talking about discrimination because it seems to me that that 's part of this picture that we 're painting around marginalisation and what creates disability in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can increase your chance of being disabled , it 's pretty clear that what we 've done is structure a society in a way that is having a very profound impact and we are feeding that with this discriminatory response , and the creation of the thing which is called disability , because it 's in our minds rather than in anybody 's body . <p> How does that work ? How does disableism as it 's called in some parts of the world , feed into this spiral ? <p> ERIC EMERSON I guess there 's probably two broad components to it . The first is the extent of which we structure our society and access to the institutions within our society which may disadvantage people with particular types of impairments or health conditions , to the extent that we create buildings in which the only way you can get up to them in steps , then we are disadvantaging and creating difficulty of access for people who have difficulty walking or use wheelchairs . The extent to which we structure health services , so that you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulate , and really good at problem-solving even to figure out how to access those health services , is discriminating against and disadvantaging people with cognitive impairments or intellectual difficulties . <p> LYNNE There 's structural and sort of institutional ... <p> ERIC EMERSON Absolutely , and nobody 's planning services or designing buildings to exclude disabled people . It 's a problem of omission of not thinking about how we develop our cities or how we build buildings or how we create services which are more inclusive . <p> LYNNE I would have thought that has improved significantly ? <p> ERIC EMERSON Absolutely , yes . <p> LYNNE Transport , access . <p> ERIC EMERSON It is improved significantly for some groups of people with disabilities . It is improved significantly , for example , if you have mobility difficulties ; we have ramps in most buildings , not everywhere , not even at the University of Melbourne . Generally , it 's easier to get around in a wheelchair than it was say 20-30 years ago . Of course , that 's not the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people say with significant intellectual or cognitive impairments , well , it has n't got that much easier . In fact , to an extent , you can think it 's actually getting more difficult the more we are dependent upon more complex technologies , the more difficult it is to negotiate your way through our institutions . I 'm sure we 've all had those really irritating attempts to try and book an appointment with our doctor when they get through to some automated telephone answering system , if you want dah-dah , press one , if you want dah-dah-dah press two . Some days I struggle with those , and I think to myself , what was number one . If you have an intellectual disability , how on earth do you even book an appointment with your family doctor ? <p> I guess , the advantages we 've seen tend to be specific and they tend to have gone to those groups of people with disabilities who have the most effective lobbying and advocacy behind them . Other groups of people with disabilities with different impairments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental health problems who have disabilities have particularly benefited and much better off than they were 10-15 years ago in Australian or British society . In a sense , we picture disability as something visible ; the disability symbol is a wheelchair or a white cane . That 's got through to an extent to people , but most disability is not visible . People may look completely normal or whatever , but that does n't mean they do n't have a disability , and that group of people are particularly disadvantaged . <p> LYNNE There 's that sort of structural discrimination , but there 's also some just plain mean , nasty treatment that people experience . <p> ERIC EMERSON Yeah , absolutely . There 's also the - I guess the more aggressive , more interpersonal discrimination in which people are just preventing people because they do n't want that kind of person around . <p> LYNNE How common is that in experience ? <p> ERIC EMERSON I think it is relatively common . Some of it is just unthinking , and again , it kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're doing some work at Sydney looking at how young Australians with disability experience discrimination in public places , discrimination on say things like public transport is quite common , but a lot of it is unthinking , it 's , well that person looks perfectly normal but they 're sitting in a disabled seat , so you get glances , you get comments . That person could well have a disability . People do n't think because we have this image in our head that disability is about wheelchairs and that 's it and if you look kind of young and healthy then , well , you should n't be doing that . <p> I guess at the other extreme there some horrendous examples of crimes being perpetrated against people with disability either because they 're easy targets or because people are scared of them or do n't like them or whatever , and that 's particularly a problem for people with mental health problems . <p> LYNNE That feeds this marginalisation , because if you are the recipient of that kind of fear or treatment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a hit . <p> ERIC EMERSON Yeah , and there 's very good evidence , not so much from the world of disability but from studies that have looked at racial or ethnic variations in health , the day-to-day interpersonal discrimination that people experience has a significant impact on their health , particularly their mental health . <p> LYNNE What you 've referred to as the corrosive effects on well-being ? <p> ERIC EMERSON Yes . <p> LYNNE Which seems to me to have a couple of effects . One , it goes to your capacity to hold down a job or maintain an educational pathway , all the sorts of challenges that it presents there , but in itself it also becomes part of the disability ? <p> ERIC EMERSON Absolutely . <p> LYNNE It creates a kind double whammy effect , I think , on breaking out of this mindset . <p> I 'm Lynne Haultain and today 's Up Close we 're talking to Professor Eric Emerson about disability and the relationship between poverty and disability . <p> LYNNE What can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to take place in order to address this ? I know that you 've set out a very interesting response to this which starts with social stratification , it addresses that big notion of , we have created as a society this concept of disability . How do we then undo that and open things up with access to education , to work , to housing , to all the things that we would , as a general community , take for granted ? It really is about evening the playing field . <p> ERIC EMERSON Yeah , absolutely . For those countries in the world that 's ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability , that 's what they 've signed up to do , to progressively realise the rights of people with disabilities to participate in all aspects of society , to have good health , to have a good well-paid respectful job , to have a family . That is something that we need to do , and clearly many countries are attempting to do that . <p> There 's good examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barriers that people with disabilities face in participating in society , particularly in areas of architecture and design of buildings and design of cities which are significantly more disability friendly for people who have motor impairments than they were before . I think also for people with some types of impairments , access to employment ; it 's not as good as it should be , but there are areas in which we can see some significant progress . I think if you look at education systems , there has been progress in identification of children with disability and providing support that children with disability might need . <p> Clearly , things have improved , the barriers have been broken down to enable people with impairments of particular types to not be disabled by those societies , but we 've still got such a long way to go . <p> LYNNE There 's the broad governmental , institutional response , but there is also a communications piece to be undertaken , is n't there ? <p> ERIC EMERSON Absolutely . We have to change minds and hearts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult . Again , it is one of the specific obligations that countries have signed up to when ratifying the UN Convention , to address the public stereotypes about disability . Buildings is one thing , but we 're not probably seeing the rate of progress or in some instances any progress in changing public attitudes about disability that we really hope to see and we really need to do . <p> LYNNE You know that that 's not shifting because we 're still seeing episodes of discrimination , or is that evident ? <p> ERIC EMERSON It 's difficult to get hard evidence on these things but yes , I mean we 're certainly still seeing higher rates of exposure of people with disabilities to crime . We 're just doing something and looking at exposure to crime among people with disabilities in New South Wales and the gap between people with disabilities and people without disabilities is just growing year-on-year . It 's not there 's more , but the reduction in exposure to crime and violent crime amongst people within New South Wales is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without disabilities than it is for people with disabilities . The relative disadvantage they 're facing is growing , and that 's common in many areas of life . You look at employment , things are getting better for people with disabilities , but they 're getting there faster for people without disabilities . <p> While things are improving , they 're getting worse at the same time , if you 're interested in the relative disadvantage that people face . It 's that relative position that you hold in society which is important , and that 's what poverty 's about ; poverty is about your position relative to other people in society , it 's about what that says about you in the society in which you 're living . <p> LYNNE Eric , what about people with impairments who are disabled and their sense of their own capacity in all of this ? You talk about that in terms of supporting the development of resilience for disabled people . How is that growing ? <p> ERIC EMERSON One of the issues is that we know in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse conditions or exposure to a virus , some people catch the cold , some people do n't . There 's an important question that we need to ask about why are some people more vulnerable or resilient in similar circumstances . What we 've learned is that while there are some aspects of the individual , in the sense of personal characteristics which make you more resilient , for example , if you 're good at communicating , and you 're good at problem-solving , you 're generally more resilient than people who are n't good at communicating and are n't good at problem-solving . These are personal things , and some of those are easy to change , and some of these are not easy to change . <p> In terms of , more importantly , resilience is about - again , it 's about the society in which you live , it 's about the society in which you personally live rather than the broad society . What resources do you have , how many friends do you have , who can you call on , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all of us and what we do within the face of adversity is we usually turn to our nearest and dearest or spend lots of money and go off and climb a mountain or whatever it is . The issue for many people with disabilities is the disadvantage not only in relation to they 're more likely to face adversities in their life , they 're also disadvantaged in that they have less access to the kinds of resources that everybody else uses when faced with adversity . Because of their social isolation , they have fewer friends , they have smaller social networks , they are less connected with the community around them because of stereotypical attitudes and the way people are socially excluded , they have less access to money , they have less access to wealth and less access to power , which puts them at a disadvantage . <p> On the one hand , they 're more likely to be exposed to adversity , and on the other hand , as a group generally , they 're more likely to be vulnerable to the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples for the exact opposite and some remarkably resilient people with disabilities as there are for people without disabilities . Taking the broad picture across the group of people with disabilities , there is an issue there . We need to be working on both sides of this ; we need to be creating societies in which people with disabilities are no more likely to be exposed to the common adversities of life than you or I. That 's not happening at the moment , we need to make much more progress there . We do want a level playing field ; we want an equal society . <p> We do n't have a magic wand , we ca n't , tomorrow , create an equal society so what else can we be doing at the same time ? It 's not an alternative ; it 's not one or the other ; what else can we be doing at the same time to help people with disabilities become more resilient , to have more friends , to have something in their life they can feel really proud about ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind about that because I know I 'm really good at this , and I think there 's a lot more that we can be doing in that area to create a society in which people can have more friends , more support and can achieve things that help them at times of adversity , and have more money etcetera . <p> All these things are important , and all these things will help people with disabilities as they do , you or I , become healthier . <p> LYNNE You 've painted an extremely powerful picture , Eric , of the challenge before us but I think , as we said at the outset , the understanding of what disability is and what it is not , is something that we all need to grapple with at every level .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Study backs wider carrier screening for Fragile X Syndrome <p> Fragile X Syndrome , a genetic trigger for autism and intellectual disability , has complex risks and consequences , but that should n't stop wider screening says new research <p> By Andrew Trounson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Fragile X Syndrome is the most common single gene cause of autism and mothers that carry the mutation can easily be screened for it , but many will never have heard of it , and your doctor is unlikely to mention it when you are pregnant or planning to start a family . <p> Current guidelines in Australia and around the world recommend testing for FXS only when there is a family history or if women request it . That 's because the symptoms can vary from just mild to severe , calculating the genetic risk is complicated , and the only choice a confirmed carrier has is a stark one between having a child or not , or if pregnant , terminating or not . <p> The problem is , about 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these will have no family history of FXS .

We are just letting them down if women and couples are n't even hearing about screening for FXS , " says Professor Metcalfe . <p> She noted that three quarters of the women in the study had never heard of FXS . <p> " What we need to do is raise awareness among people who are considering starting a family and among health professionals .

" The cost of screening does raise concerns over whether the system is equitable , " says Professor Metcalfe . <p> One of the reasons that information on screening for FXS is n't promoted is partly a function of the unease many feel about the difficult decision that a woman , particularly one who is already pregnant , will face if they do test positive , says Professor Metcalfe . Any decision is further complicated by the fact that the symptoms of FXS can vary widely from child to child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on someone 's individual genetic information . <p> Testing decisions are further complicated by carriers of the gene mutation being more at risk themselves of early menopause and fertility problems in the case of women , and a risk of a degenerative neurological disease ( Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome ) that is more likely to affect male carriers . <p> " There has always been discomfort around screening for a condition that is primarily an intellectual disability and behavioural problem . It is also a complex condition because there is a whole range of risk and potential symptoms . <p> " But the women in this study were able to understand the complex information provided through pre-test counselling and written information , and this helped them to make University 's Privacy Officer at **30;229;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> Australia 's generational wealth divide is biting <p> The 2017 HILDA Survey of Australians ' economic and social well-being shows that many young homeowners are struggling to pay down debt , if they can get into the market at all , putting in doubt the sustainability of the retirement system <p> By Andrew Trounson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> A third of young Australian homeowners are n't making any progress in repaying their mortgages from one year to the next , and are instead increasing their home debt , raising serious concerns over whether they will ever have enough superannuation to fund their retirement . <p> Combined with data showing stalled income growth and a rising number of young people being priced out of housing -- a key vehicle for retirement savings -- the HILDA report points to an emerging crisis in the sustainability of Australia 's retirement system , reflecting a stark wealth divide between well-off baby boomers and younger generations . <p> There is also a big divide between men and women at retirement , with men having almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant disadvantage . <h> Younger generations financially vulnerable <p> " At this stage , the message from the HILDA numbers is that the generations coming up are not going to have quite the same living standards in retirement that many of the baby boomer generation will have , " says survey leader and University of Melbourne economist Professor Roger Wilkins . <p> " You have to wonder whether these young homeowners who are n't paying down their mortgages , will have paid off their loans by the time they retire . <p> " They may be thinking , perhaps unconsciously , that they are going to use their superannuation to pay off their homes and then simply go on the aged pension . So it really raises questions about the sustainability of the retirement income system . " <p> Under Australia 's Superannuation Guarantee employers are required to make payments towards a worker 's retirement savings ( superannuation fund ) equivalent to at least 9.5 per cent of their pay . <p> Compiled by the Melbourne Institute , Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social well being of Australians going back to 2001 . It has grown to include over 17,000 people , and is a key source of information for policy makers . <p> This year 's report also includes analysis on gambling , showing that almost 40 per cent of adults gamble at least once a month , punting an average $115 a month . There is also an analysis on social attitudes showing that Australians are becoming more progressive . In particular there is rising support for same sex couples to have the same rights as heterosexual couples . <p> Professor Wilkins says this year 's survey is the first time he has gone back through the HILDA data to track the progress of homeowners in repaying their debts , and he was shocked by the results . " I had to keep double checking it because I thought it must be wrong , " he says . " You tend to think of people buying their house and then paying off their loans over time , but for many that just is n't happening . " <p> He found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homeowners aged 18-39 increased the debt they owed on their home . While some of that may represent young homeowners buying more expensive houses , Professor Roger Wilkins says the proportion is too large to be simply explained by " upsizing . " Instead he suggests that significant numbers are using equity in their homes to raise additional debt for other expenses . <p> Growth in average household incomes has slowed since 2009 and fell in 2015 from $89,940 to $89,341 -- first fall since HILDA began in 2001 <p> Average housing debt of 18-39 Yo almost doubled in real terms since 2002 from to in 2014 <p> Proportion of 18-39 Yo homeowners in negative equity up from 2.4% in 2002 to 3.9% in 2014 <p> Proportion of 18-39 Yo homeowners increasing their home debt from was 32% in 2015 , but down from 42.3% in 2002 <p> Home ownership rates among 18-39 Yo has slumped from 35.7% in 2002 to 25.2% in 2014 <p> Average superannuation of people of people at retirement in the four years to 2015 was for men , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay off debts was 9.9% for men , 13.1% for women <p> Concerns over the sustainability of the retirement system are compounded by the increasing indebtedness of 18-39 year-old homeowners . On the positive side , the debt is offset by home values , so less than 4 per cent have negative equity ( when house debt exceeds the value of the home borrowed against ) . But Professor Wilkins says it still means that the economic wellbeing of young homeowners is " highly vulnerable " to house price falls and interest rate hikes . <p> While young homeowners appear to be increasingly financially vulnerable , Professor Wilkins says falling home ownership rates among 18-39 year olds suggests many are being priced out of the market . And he warns that creates an additional uncertainty over future retirement savings . <p> " The decline in home ownership among young people is concerning because buying a house has traditionally been the primary way people have saved for retirement . But that model appears to be breaking down . <p> " On current trajectories many 18-39 year olds do n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices fall that will change , but even then , because many will then be buying later in life , they will have less time to pay off their homes . " <p> He says new policies for addressing the generational wealth divide need to be considered , and these could include reducing tax concessions on superannuation and negative gearing , as well as possibly including the family home in the assets test for the aged pension . <p> " These are n't politically easy policy solutions because they will hurt the large baby boomer generation that is now retiring , but I think we do need a more equal treatment of income in the tax system . " <h> The challenges of single-parenthood <p> At the low-income end of the scale , HILDA starkly reveals the persistent disadvantage faced by single-parent families , who have experienced no improvement in their high poverty rates . Over 20 per cent of single parent families are in relative poverty , more than double the national average . <p> " Child poverty is a particular concern for policy makers because of the damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life prospects , " warns the report . <p> Professor Wilkins says the poverty of single parent families demands a renewed policy focus around the adequacy of child support arrangements , and polices to make it easier for single parents to earn an income while looking after their children , targeting items like childcare costs and flexible work hours . <p> It also raises the question of whether divorced women , who traditionally will have had more child-care duties and less opportunity to build remunerative careers , should have some ongoing claim to their ex-partner 's superannuation . Under current laws , superannuation is split evenly at the time of the break up , but from that point the earning and saving capacity of the woman is likely to be significantly less than that of her ex-partner . <p> " There is this question then of whether these women should have some ongoing claim on their partner 's superannuation to reflect that , " says Professor Wilkins . <h> Overall rates of poverty in decline <p> But in terms of overall poverty in society , HILDA shows that relative poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is defined as an income that is less than half the median ( or middle ) income . The proportion of Australians in such relative poverty has steadily fallen since 2007 from 13.2 per cent to 9.7 per cent in 2015 . <p> And holding the real value of the poverty line at its 2001 level , the poverty rate has dropped from 13.1 per cent in 2001 to 3.7 per cent in 2015 . " Even among the poor , average living standards have increased over the full 15 year period , " the report notes . <p> " It is a good sign that the slow down in income growth has n't led to a mass increase in very low incomes , " says Professor Wilkins .

 <p> One of the biggest changes concerns attitudes toward the rights of homosexual couples . A comparison of attitudes in 2005 versus 2015 shows that both men and women are now more likely to agree with the statement : " Homosexual couples should have the same rights as heterosexual couples do . ' ' With scoring ranging from 1 ( strong disagreement ) to 7 ( strong agreement ) , men 's attitudes have shifted from 3.3 ( 2005 ) to 4.8 ( 2015 ) , and women 's attitudes from 4.0 ( 2005 ) to 5.3 ( 2015 ) . <p> The results also show we are now more positive about unmarried couples living together and women raising children as single parents . <p> But why has a shift toward less traditional viewpoints occurred when conservative and right-wing political groups seem to be growing across the world ? While it is impossible to definitively explain broad attitudinal shifts , a few factors can help make sense of them . <p> Although it is unclear whether participants interpreted the question as directly related to gay marriage , we know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forefront of public debate . <h> A sustained campaign <p> In 1976 in TheHistory of Sexuality Volume 1 , Michel Foucault famously argued that it is the prohibition of sexuality that paradoxically increases discussion of the topic . Although marriage equality has not come to pass in Australia , endless discussion has been generated on the subject , not least because a sustained campaign arose in the wake of the overt ban on same-sex marriage introduced by former Prime Minister John Howard . <p> In response to Howard 's changes to the Marriage Act in 2004 , which now sees marriage defined as ' the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others ' , the Australian Marriage Equality campaign group formed . Since then there have also been heated debates in parliament and the media , several parliamentary inquiries , thousands of people protesting in the streets , online petitions and the formation of numerous lobbying and campaign groups . <p> Since the Howard Government 's changes to the Marriage Act in 2004 , which defined marriage as between a man and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality in Australia . Picture : Levi <p> In 2013 the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly briefly passed a marriage equality ruling that saw 31 couples marry , only to be overturned by the Federal Government within a week . <p> With many countries legalising marriage equality -- including Canada ( 2005 ) , New Zealand ( 2013 ) and the United States ( 2015 ) -- the consensus among many seems to be that , despite the Government 's refusal , marriage equality in Australia is inevitable . Notably there has been some debate within Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender and Queer ( LGBTQ ) communities about whether marriage equality ought to be central to their activism . However , even this debate reveals the campaign has led to greater attention on the rights of homosexual couples . <h> Gay couples on the rise <p> The number of Australians who report identifying as part of a gay or lesbian couple is also increasing , which may or may not also be related to the equal marriage debate . The 2016 census data revealed a huge 42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Gender theorist Judith Butler has argued that greater social recognition of LGBTQ issues opens up cultural space for more people to openly identify as LGBTQ . In turn , this contributes to more cultural visibility , be that in mainstream media or in interpersonal contexts , and more space for LGBTQ identification . <p> While a positive change in discourse around the rights of homosexuals does n't ' make ' people gay or lesbian , it does allow greater room for people to identify in these ways . <p> This may mean that , in general , individuals are now more likely to know someone who identifies as gay or lesbian in their family or social network , which could be influencing attitudes toward the question of homosexual rights . Indeed given the reinforcing nature of greater LGBTQ recognition , this may help to explain the steady upward trend in results over time . <p> As Gayle Rubin identified in her famous essay Thinking Sex , first published in 1984 , attitudes toward unmarried couples and gay and lesbian couples in the USA are an area of contestation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a hierarchy -- with some arrangements and acts seen as more acceptable than others . The change toward more progressive attitudes highlighted by the HILDA Survey data suggests that perhaps the campaign for marriage equality , and in turn the greater numbers of people identifying as part of gay and lesbian couples , might be having some kind of impact . <p> However , what the HILDA Survey does not reveal is whether attitudes toward single homosexual people , people in polyamorous relationships , or those who identify elsewhere on the LGBTQ spectrum are also changing for the better . <p> Perhaps the lesson here is that if campaigns for social change make a real impact on attitudes , then we need to make sure these movements recognise a diversity of identities .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> What 17 years of data tells us about Australia <p> The annual HILDA Survey offers important insights into the economic and social wellbeing of Australians <p> By Professor Roger Wilkins and Professor Mark Wooden , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> The Household , Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey , or HILDA as it is known , is unique among Australian household surveys . Initiated by the Australian government at the start of this century , HILDA is not only nationally representative , it is longitudinal , in that the same people are interviewed each year . <p> Now in its seventeenth year , HILDA is providing important insights into the life courses of Australians that are simply not possible with any other data source . <p> Among the many insights , perhaps the key finding from the HILDA Survey is just how volatile the lives of many Australians are . Consider , for example , the question of income poverty . Annual poverty rates generally range in the vicinity of 10 per cent to 14 per cent . The HILDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ households are not persistently poor : over half of those who experience poverty over a 10-year period are in poverty for only 1 or 2 years . <p> More importantly , the types of persons who are exposed to persistent poverty -- approximately 3 per cent of the population -- are very different to those for whom poverty is a more transitory situation . And we would argue that it is the former group who should be a greater focus of government assistance . <p> This volatility in economic fortunes perhaps also provides some insight into why our welfare system appears to be so valued by Australians . HILDA shows that , while less than 20 per cent of 15-64 year olds personally receive welfare at any one point in time , over a 15-year period , 71 per cent of them will at some stage have a member of their household receiving welfare . <p> In the area of employment and work , HILDA research has also been debunking many myths . Research examining gender pay gaps , for example , finds that very little of the gap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences at the bottom of the wage distribution . The large differences in the pay of men and women would appear to be mainly due to glass ceiling effects and differential rates of promotion and career progression . <p> Other research has looked at the question of whether casual employment has negative consequences for mental health , but no evidence to support this could be found . One reason for this finding is that , for many , casual employment is not a permanent state . However , for those who do end up finding themselves ' trapped ' in casual employment , there may be more adverse consequences . Our own ongoing research , for example , suggests that prolonged exposure to casual employment has scarring effects on future earnings . <p> HILDA data confirm what is well known -- that , on average , the better educated you are the better off you will be in terms of a wide range of economic and social outcomes . But more controversially , when it comes to earnings of university graduates , the data also suggest that where people study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not have an exclusive focus on economic well-being . Notably it includes questions designed to measure subjective well-being . These ' happiness ' measures have been the subject of much scrutiny , in part because they are thought to better capture what people really care about . On the other hand , it is also argued that people are naturally resilient and tend to always report being reasonably content with their lives . <p> The HILDA data suggest that the reality lies somewhere between these two extremes . Life satisfaction scores do respond in predictable ways to changing life events , such as job loss and serious illness . Nevertheless , for most people these responses are quite small , while the effects of more serious shocks tend to be short-lived . But what the HILDA data are very good for is identifying the sorts of individuals for whom this is not true -- the people who persistently report low levels of life satisfaction . This may be a very small group ( perhaps 2 per cent of the population ) but it is this group who are most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> HILDA has also improved our understanding of family life in Australia . It has shown , for example , that men are starting to do more around the house as their partners do more in the paid workforce . But men still have a lot of room for improvement , which might help explain why women are on average less satisfied with their husbands than are men with their wives . <p> Perhaps surprisingly , but consistent with findings for other countries , HILDA shows that children reduce the happiness of their parents . This of course raises the question of why people choose to have children in the first place . One answer is that we are irrational , or at least ill-informed . However , Melissa Graham at Deakin University presents evidence that children may have a positive long-term impact on health and well-being . <p> HILDA is designed to ' live ' forever , and its value in improving our understanding of the lives of Australians will continue to grow as it grows older ; for example , by allowing us to understand intergenerational effects . @ @ @ University 's Privacy Officer at **30;659;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> Going underground for green energy <p> Geothermal or geoexchange energy uses underground temperatures to make heating and cooling more efficient , and researchers are piloting this technology in one of Australia 's biggest infrastructure initiatives , the Metro Tunnel Project <p> By By Andrew Trounson , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> The $11 billion Metro Tunnel rail link project , which will run under central Melbourne , is one of Australia 's biggest infrastructure projects , but there has been some unusual ground testing going on at the sites of two of the new underground stations . <p> University of Melbourne researchers have been pumping water underground through plastic pipes tagged with sensors to test the ground 's potential to retain and transfer heat -- its so-called ' thermal conductivity ' . Such geothermal energy has the potential to significantly cut the power cost of keeping the stations cool in summer and heated in winter . <p> So far the results have been positive and a pilot study is about to start . If adopted , it could be the high-profile contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The technology is already widely used in North America and Northern Europe , including in underground train stations in Switzerland and the UK , but is barely heard of here . <p> Geothermal energy is based on the simple idea that we can use the constant temperature found as little as five metres underground to help regulate temperatures inside buildings . <p> " It is using the ground to effectively get free energy for heating and cooling , " says Dr Guillermo from the Melbourne School of Engineering at the University Melbourne , who has been leading the project . <p> In summer , the underground temperature will almost always be lower than the air temperature , and almost always higher than the air temperature in winter . By pumping water for air conditioning systems through the ground , the water temperature can be changed by a few degrees up or down . That is enough to realise potentially significant power savings with the help of ground source heat pumps . <p> For example , a conventional heater will generate almost 1 kilowatt of thermal energy for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system can generate between 2 and 3 kW per kW of power . But with geothermal , the efficiency can easily rise to 4-5 kWs per kW of power . <h> Using earth energy or geoexchange <p> In Melbourne , the underground temperature is consistently around 18-19 degrees Celsius , but on a hot summer day temperatures will reach about 30 . In such conditions a geothermal system can cool the water by passing it underground in loops of piping to naturally reject the heat into the earth , before feeding the cooler water into a ground source heat pump to generate air conditioning . It means less energy power is needed to run the conditioning system . In winter it just works in reverse . <p> Such geothermal energy is often called ' earth energy ' , or ' geoexchange ' , to distinguish it from geothermal power generated from hot rocks and steam deep below the earth 's surface . <p> Dr is confident that a geothermal system , embedded in the retaining walls of the Melbourne Metro stations , could efficiently provide all their heating requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's geothermal team of engineers is the only group in Australia that has the technological , fieldwork , and laboratory expertise to undertake computer modelling of geothermal projects using non-traditional ground heat exchangers . Under the Translating Research at Melbourne program they have established a start up named Fourth Element Energy to explore commercialising their geothermal modelling software . <h> Pilot systems already running <p> Under the leadership of Dr and geotechnical engineer Professor Ian Johnston , the team has already installed over 20 pilot geothermal systems across Victoria , from homes to cafes , that have been funded by a $1.6 million grant from the Victorian Government and $1 million grant from the Federal Government . <p> One of their biggest projects to date is the new Elizabeth Blackburn School of Sciences in Parkville , which the researchers are using as an ongoing experiment to test the limits of geothermal power . A real-time web page constantly monitors the performance at the school , including the energy savings , dollar savings and greenhouse gas reductions . <p> Screen shot of the real-time web page monitoring the performance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sciences at University of Melbourne 's Parkville campus <p> In addition , together with industry partners Ground Source Systems and Golder Associates and Associate Professor Lu Aye , the team is finalising details to install and monitor geothermal systems in poultry farms in NSW and Victoria as part of a $300,000 grant from the Australian Research Council . <p> Dr says the geothermal opportunity for building owners extends to even on-selling their excess geothermal power , and such on-selling is important in keeping geothermal systems in balance between hot and cold . That is because geothermal systems are most cost-effective and efficient when the demands for heating and cooling balance each other out over summer and winter . If the cooling requirement of a building is higher than the heating needs , then excess heat will gradually raise the temperature of the ground , making it less efficient . In such situations Dr says efficiency can be enhanced if the excess heat is on-sold during the winter months to other buildings that may need it . <h> Growing fast overseas <p> " In summer geothermal systems reject heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground will heat up . That is usually fine because in winter we can extract it again . But when the system is rejecting a lot more heat than it is extracting in winter it reduces efficiency . So if a project can on-sell excess heat it can be better balanced and more efficient , " he explains . <p> The University of Melbourne is proposing to take excess heat from the Metro Tunnel 's Parkville station into its campus in the form of piped water heated to 20-40 degrees Celsius . The excess heat would be equivalent to 120 kW for between 4 and 8 months every year . <p> Geothermal power is one of the fastest growing sustainable energy technologies with over four million installations across the world . In the US and elsewhere it has benefitted from government subsidies , and in Sweden 90 per cent of the building renovation and modernisation segment includes geothermal systems . But in Australia , Dr says the small scale of the industry means the capital costs can be prohibitive . For example , there are only a few geothermal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The main barrier is the high capital cost , and that is because in a market like Australia 's the drilling cost is more expensive than it could be , " says Dr . <h> A greenfield energy opportunity <p> But in new projects like the Metro Tunnel Project , where significant drilling has to happen anyway , he says the cost of installing thermal systems is much cheaper . <p> At current costs , retrofitting geothermal is competitive with high-cost power sources such as bottled gas in country areas , but the capital costs mean it is often uncompetitive against traditional electricity and gas power . However , based on the results from the University 's 20 projects so far , Dr estimates that a government subsidy or rebate of just 8 per cent would be enough to make geothermal competitive with traditional power sources . That could then encourage the industry to grow and become more competitive in its own right . <p> Such rebates have been applied in other countries . In Canada power companies have even seen value in making low-interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may seem counter-intuitive for a utility to be encouraging geothermal energy that will use less peak power , Dr says that by reducing power consumption growth , utilities can forestall having to invest in new expensive power stations . <p> " We have established ourselves as one of the leaders in the country for geothermal heating and cooling because we believe the industry has a good future here , " says Dr . <p> " It will need some encouragement from government , but opportunities like the Metro Tunnel Project are important for raising awareness and proving its feasibility .

This is a beautiful example , Parler Seul . It 's just a beautiful example of Mir ? ' s abstract placement . The placement - you can see here the placement on the page with his works and the poetry is really beautiful . This is what was really radical about these books because they merged the text and the artwork as one , whereas , before , that it was like the text and then it was illustrated so you 'd have a picture . It was very conservative , but this was just like completely modernist . All the avant-garde people just got involved . It was quite amazing . <p> ANDI HORVATH This was a revolution in the book world . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Absolutely . <p> ANDI HORVATH This happened because of the stresses of World War II . Or did it start earlier ? <p> SUSAN MILLARD No . It started at the turn of the century , so 20th century . The ' 20s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I said , everybody went there , all the artists and writers ended up together and they were all hanging out together . It was just such a scene . <p> ANDI HORVATH You know some of the goss , the gossip that happened to some of these artists and authors . What 's one of your favourite stories ? <p> SUSAN MILLARD : Laughs . Look , I mean there 's a whole lot of interesting things . For instance , this is Sonia Delaunay . She 's absolutely fantastic . She just did so much work . She did a whole lot of fashion work and she did fashion for a lot of plays and avant-garde plays , but she also did it for the Ballet Russe . She was just major . <p> ANDI HORVATH This is 1920s . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Twenties , ' 30s and then - by the time the Second World War came along they - she ended up with a whole lot of other artists . This is like Jean Arp , Sophie Taeuber-Arp and - and some of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these on the wall . They all were in a commune together . They were all hanging out , so it was pretty amazing . They were all living together in the south of France . During the war it was difficult , of course , because she was Jewish too , Sonia Delaunay . Very difficult times for them , but they got through it . Her stuff is just absolutely ... <p> ANDI HORVATH Wow . This looks like really abstract ... <p> SUSAN MILLARD Very abstract . <p> ANDI HORVATH ... geometrics . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yes , yeah . <p> ANDI HORVATH ... and fashion and even the dresses and the settings for the dresses are geometric and abstract . Use your imagination . It 's full on abstract and we 're talking about a revolutionary way of illustrating books . Show us something contemporary . I saw something the other day under your arm , which was something written by Paul Kelly . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yes . <p> ANDI HORVATH He 's the singer songwriter . <p> SUSAN MILLARD I 'll show you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He just illustrated - David Frazer does these amazing woodcut works . He illustrated Little Aches and Pains by Paul Kelly . It 's a beautiful work and very poignant and just a lovely work . <p> ANDI HORVATH These are collectables as well . There 's clearly a market for these rare books . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yes . Well , they are - they 're rare because - in this case because they 're all limited edition . That makes another - that 's another , actually , reason why things are rare . Usually , the Australian artists do about 10 . Sometimes they do 15 . It depends on how much they can sell really . Often they sell to institutions . Then there 's a few private buyers as well . This one in particular too is ... <p> ANDI HORVATH What 's this one ? <p> SUSAN MILLARD Sorry . I 'll just get this up . This is called Europa to Oceania , which really is - just says it all for me for this exhibition . This is George , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all about the immigrant experience and their families coming over ... <p> ANDI HORVATH Oh , this is a bound book . Oh , with little fold-outs . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Angela does all this beautiful lino cut work , and George does all this work . George bound the book too . He 's a binder . Anthony just wrote all this very pithy - little bits about the immigrant experience . It 's a really gorgeous book . It won the MacKay Artist Book Award . The Bodleian have just bought it . <p> ANDI HORVATH Have you been purchasing stuff for the University of Melbourne Library and Archives ? <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yeah . Well , not the archives , because they 're separate . This is just the special collections , rare books . Yeah , I have purchased a lot of the stuff going into this exhibition . <p> ANDI HORVATH Must be fun shopping for rare books . <p> SUSAN MILLARD It is . Laughter <p> SUSAN MILLARD We 've got much more of a limited budget this year , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's good that we make informed decisions about what we buy . Often that will relate to teaching and learning , so we will do a lot of classes with students , which is fantastic . We bring them in and show them the books so they can actually have that real physical experience with the items . It 's always wonderful . They 're always - they love it . <p> ANDI HORVATH It 's much better than seeing it digitised on a computer screen , to actually see the physical object . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yes , that 's really the point of it . That 's why we try and maintain these things , so that even future generations can get that - can have that experience . It 's great for information to have digital , and it 's good to have digital . I 'm not a - it 's great , but to see the physical object - we 've got , for instance , a 1632 second folio for Shakespeare , for instance . When the students of - Shakespeare students come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just lovely . It 's a really - it 's a great thing to be able to show them . <p> ANDI HORVATH Susan , there are pillows everywhere in this store . This is what you rest the books on , right ? These are like ... <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yeah , they 're like beanbags . <p> ANDI HORVATH Oh , okay . <p> SUSAN MILLARD They 're beanbags for the books so they can have a little snooze . <p> ANDI HORVATH Laughs . <p> SUSAN MILLARD We would like to have a little snooze too on them , but that 's probably not appropriate . Seriously , it 's very important to look after the spines of the books . We have these pillows so when you open a book it can rest very neatly and the spine is protected when you open things . <p> ANDI HORVATH Wow . <p> SUSAN MILLARD This is this David Frazer . <p> ANDI HORVATH This is the Paul Kelly one . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yes . <p> ANDI HORVATH Paul Kelly ... <p> SUSAN MILLARD It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the linocut chap - David ... <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yeah , linocut , woodcut chap , David Frazer , did the ... <p> ANDI HORVATH Amazing linocuts . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Beautiful , are n't they ? <p> ANDI HORVATH Yeah . The woodcuts . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Woodcuts , usually . He does do big linocuts too . Actually , David Frazer is doing a print workshop for us as part of our public program . That 's going to be gorgeous . He 's going to come down and bring his little press and - so people can have a go at doing their own little print with his print . <p> ANDI HORVATH I so want to do that . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Oh , I know . It 's very exciting . I 've seen him do it before . It 's so nice , and people love it , so we thought that 'd be a nice public program to go with the exhibition . <p> ANDI HORVATH I know audio is an audio medium , but the visual effect of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ANDI HORVATH You really sink into some of his pictures . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yes , absolutely . <p> ANDI HORVATH The detail is quite incredible . You must have good glasses . <p> SUSAN MILLARD It is fantastic . He works from Castlemaine now . He 's got his studio up there and lives up there . I just think this is really beautiful . <p> ANDI HORVATH Susan - no , this is going to be a question you 're going to be annoyed that I 'm asking you . Are you ready ? Try and take on the challenge . There 's a fire . What do you grab ? <p> SUSAN MILLARD Oh no , do n't . Do n't ask it . <p> ANDI HORVATH I have to make her choose between her babies . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Look , we 've always had a joke about this in heritage collections . The first thing one should grab is your accession register , all the lists of stuff that you 've actually owned or ever owned , really , from a bibliographic point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . At the moment I 've got a digitising project to actually digitise all our accession registers so we wo n't have to grab those . <p> Oh look , I do n't know . I mean how would you know - and you ca n't . I mean you 'd grab a Gutenberg leaf , you 'd grab a Breviary , probably the things that are - the manuscripts , the medieval manuscripts and stuff , because they 're irreplaceable , whereas something like the Gutenberg leaf is printed so , ultimately , there is another copy in the world somewhere , so I 'd be going for the ... <p> ANDI HORVATH What surprises have you encountered with the public when rare books become available to the public to look at , like during Rare Book Week ? What surprises and misconceptions do the public have about rare books ? <p> SUSAN MILLARD Everybody says what a fantastic job . You get to sit here with the books all day , which is , of course , not the case because there 's a lot of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is a privilege to work with this material . It 's so beautiful . I think you have to be passionate about it to really do these jobs because they 're - one of the misconceptions is it 's a library . <p> The thing about these collections is they actually require quite specific security , much higher security , much - look , more intense environment conditions . This room is about 19 degrees . We have to keep them quite cool and in the dark . As we walked in it was in the dark . There are things that people do n't understand often about the - about looking after these collections . They think it 's just like a normal library where you can schlep the things around and - but you ca n't - and there 's a whole lot of - you 're always arguing that sort of point . I think that 's probably - the biggest thing is that people think you just sit here and look at the books all day , which is - I mean we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One thing about being in amongst the rare book collections here is that a lot of the books are huge . They 're giant . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Oh , for sure . There 's a lot of giant folios here . Then we 've got elephant folios all over here , which - like Gould 's Birds of Australia and Mammals of Australia . They are magnificent ; full sets of those and they 're gorgeous . Having stuff like that - and getting those out and showing people . They always gasp . It 's just lovely . It 's lovely to show those things to people . I really enjoy that actually , showing people the material . That 's one of the really - real joys of the job actually . <p> ANDI HORVATH What will you be pointing out in your exhibition , Art on the Page , when your mum comes in ? What are you going to drag her over to first ? <p> SUSAN MILLARD Probably the Mir ? , to be honest . Mir ? ' s Tzara , because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> SUSAN MILLARD It is beautiful , and it 's my - probably one of my favourite items really . I really love this Matisse , Charles d'Orleans as well because that 's a gorgeous story too . It 's just lovely . <p> ANDI HORVATH Tell us about Henri Matisse . <p> SUSAN MILLARD This Matisse is - I think it 's one of the last books he did . I think it 's the last book he did actually . He was - he had an operation and ended up in hospital . He was - while he was recuperating he read all the poetry of Charles d'Orleans and he - this Charles - he was captured by the British . He 's French . He was captured by the British in the Battle of Agincourt in the 1400s and was actually a prisoner for 20 years or so , and wrote all this fantastic - really playful poetry really . Matisse just fell in love with it and did this whole book based around this poetry . As you can see , he just went a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this is his writing . <p> ANDI HORVATH He wrote it as well . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yes , he ... <p> ANDI HORVATH That 's his writing . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yes , that 's all very beautiful . <p> ANDI HORVATH Susan , it looks a little bit . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Very . <p> ANDI HORVATH I did n't want to be rude , but it just looks a little bit like I could have done that . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yeah . <p> ANDI HORVATH Have I just crossed a path with you ? <p> SUSAN MILLARD No , no . I mean I know this is - but he did it like that purposefully . <p> ANDI HORVATH Oh , I see . <p> SUSAN MILLARD The actual image - the frontispiece is going on the wall . There 'll be a lot of stuff on the wall as well in this exhibition . I know what you 're saying about it , but it is really beautiful . <p> ANDI HORVATH It is beautiful . I mean I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , but you have to be Matisse laughs . That 's the whole point , I think . <p> ANDI HORVATH It 's really crayony . <p> SUSAN MILLARD It is very crayony , is n't it ? <p> ANDI HORVATH Just like he 's done frames to these poetry , and then he 's just gone round with a green line , then a black line , then a red line , and then a burgundy line . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yeah . <p> ANDI HORVATH And made it a little bit curly . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yeah . It 's all about the French thing , all the fleur-de-lis . It 's cute . There 's rabbits in there which I really love . I love the rabbits , but I ca n't find the rabbits of course . <p> ANDI HORVATH It does feel special being in the presence of a Henri Matisse rabbit ... <p> SUSAN MILLARD Well , it is . <p> ANDI HORVATH ... and his handwriting . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Oh god , yes . <p> ANDI HORVATH There is something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poem called Chanson . <p> SUSAN MILLARD I know . It 's just fantastic . I mean it really is a very special experience to be close to these things and in the presence of them . <p> ANDI HORVATH What would you like the public to think about next time they 're passing by a book shop and there 's a rare book in the window ? What do you want people to think next time they see something that 's a rare book ? <p> SUSAN MILLARD That it 's an extraordinary thing and it should be preserved for future generations . It should be enjoyed and people should be able to see them and touch them and just have the experience of being with them , and to appreciate history really , I guess , is what it 's about . <p> ANDI HORVATH Does it represent a moment in time between an artist and an author that can never really be reproduced ? <p> SUSAN MILLARD Yes , actually . That 's a really good point . I suppose one of the big things about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit in the middle that I did n't say is - Petr Herel is Czechoslovakian . He came out to Australia in 1973 , but then got a job in Canberra , in the graphic investigation workshop in 1979 . He was so influential . All his students came out of this particular school of - very European school of thought . <p> They just all went very radical and made all these fantastic amazing artist books and did a whole lot of amazing work . That really set the scene . As I said , now the Melbourne scene is quite large and there 's all these people collaborating . They all get together and do works together . It is really - it 's just produced this amazing level of creativity of this group of people . <p> ANDI HORVATH Susan , thank you for taking us on an adventure into rare books and being here in the presence . I know we 've pushed the limits of audio , but hey , we like to do that sometimes . <p> SUSAN MILLARD Laughs . Yes , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahh , that rare book smell , unmistakable .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Censorship and celebration at La Mama <p> Fifty years of La Mama theatre is documented in the University of Melbourne Archives , offering an insight into the emergence of Melbourne 's avant-garde theatre scene in the late 1960s <p> By Jane Beattie , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Inspired by New York 's La Mama Experimental Theatre Club , founder Betty Burstall was confident that Melbourne performers and audiences wanted and needed a place for progressive music , poetry and film too . <p> La Mama nurtured local talent and rode the international wave of social and cultural change in the late 1960s to provide a platform for alternative voices in the arts . In a company newsletter from October 1969 this vision was expanded : La Mama would be a theatre to make possible " a new audience-actor relationship . It was informal , direct , immediate . It was also a playwrights ' theatre ... where you could hear what people now were thinking and feeling . " <p> Early archival material , such as correspondence and newsletters , reveals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of developing solely Australian work was financially risky in an arts scene dominated by the mainstream canon of mainly American and English work . <p> One of the first performances in La Mama was ' An Hairy Man ' by Frank Bren , one of the many whose career was nurtured in the basement of the theatre . Picture : University of Melbourne Archives <h> Censorship and controversy <p> " Revolutionary things are happening in theatre today and I want them here . " 's ambitions for La Mama were grand , and the revolution began almost immediately , with plays pushing the legal boundaries of decency of the time . <p> The 1968 play ' Norm and Ahmed ' included ' obscene ' language , which led to the arrest of both the actor and the producer .

In 1969 , John Romeril 's Whatever Happened to Realism resulted in the arrest of nine actors for using obscene language in a public place . <p> Boxes of news-cuttings from this era tell the story of La Mama 's ongoing battle against censorship and the restrictions imposed by Australian social and cultural values of the time . <p> The archives also feature production posters , including lino-cuts crafted by Tim Burstall , Betty 's husband . The few styles repeated in different colours with handwritten production dates and times illustrate trends in grassroots art and design , as well as the collaborative nature of La Mama . <p> Other established artists such as photographer Peter Lyssiotis created production posters and art work -- in Lyssiotis ' case posters and artwork for his playwright daughter Tes . A wild variety of style and quality is demonstrated in some of the earlier posters by anonymous artists whose work is marked with holes left by the staples used to distribute them on street corners . <p> An example of a Tim Burstall lino-cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supporting other art forms <p> La Mama encompassed many more facets of the Melbourne avant-garde arts scene . Neo Kyma refers to a movement in Greek music that found popularity in the 1960s and 70s , extending well into the 1980s in Australian Greek communities . For around five years , Christos and Tasos Ioannidis played Greek and music at La Mama . <p> La Mama Poetica celebrates poetry and spoken word and remains a mainstay in the theatre 's program . Picture : University of Melbourne Archives <p> " The 1970s and ' 80s were the golden era of Melbourne 's Greek community . Everything , including the arts , was blooming . Especially La Mama - it was not only for Greeks , it was a place of meeting , getting together , it became a culture " explains Christos . and Liz Jones , who followed her as artistic director in 1977 , had created a space where artists from all backgrounds could practice , improvise and collaborate with their peers <p> Poetry and spoken word were also promoted from La Mama 's inception in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continues today as a regular in La Mama 's program .

Left field inclusions were the works of Indonesian poets performed by Geoff Fox , radical experimental poet and a founding member of Australia 's Poet 's Union . And there was Thalia , a night dedicated to the Perseverance Poets collective , featuring Louise Craig and Whitefeather Light . <p> Despite earlier confrontations with the law , La Mama continued supporting Australian writers , actors and directors , providing a place where collaboration and experimentation were centre-stage .

If injured , even in the eye or brain , it can repair itself using cells that reside within the injured tissues to fully restore function . <p> In contrast to humans , zebrafish are masters at regenerating their nerve cells . But scientists at the University of Melbourne are studying how they activate certain cells to heal eye injuries with the aim of replicating the process in humans . <p> The humble zebrafish is an important source of information for geneticists .

Also , their entire genome has been sequenced , making the zebrafish an ideal place to find answers to genetic questions about human health . <p> Her team focuses on understanding how regeneration occurs in the eye 's nerve cells , which are affected in neurodegenerative visual diseases , and are similar to nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord . <p> Two-day old zebrafish , in which nerve cells have activated a particular gene glow .

These can once again divide to make many new cells that can replace lost nerve cells and so repair the eye tissue and function . <p> " The eye , brain and spinal cord of zebrafish and humans contain similar glia cells , that have the potential to regenerate nerve cells , " Dr Jusuf says . <p> Using a genetically modified strain of zebrafish , in which these glia cells express green fluorescent protein , the cells can be visualised throughout the regenerative response . Using a red stain that shows dividing cells , the green glia cells can be seen to divide to generate new nerve cells following injury . <p> All vertebrate retinas ( neural sheet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green ) that are specifically activated ( red ) after injury . In Dr 's team 's genetically modified transgenic line , these glia express green fluorescent protein and the red stain indicates cell division ( to generate new cells ) following injury .

Picture : Supplied <p> " Unfortunately when human brain tissue is damaged by injury or disease , we increase the expression of different genes in these glia , resulting in glial scar formation , and permanent loss of neural function . " <p> It is currently unclear why human glia cells , which have the same genes as zebrafish , so the same ' ingredients ' for repair , re-express different genes rather than undertaking the regenerative process found in the fish . <p> A recent study led by the University of Washington has shown that the approach of reactivating regenerative mechanisms identified in zebrafish in a mouse model makes it possible to reactivate glial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " This is an amazing result , because it confirms the ability of mice and hopefully humans in using their own glia cells to regenerate their own nerve cells , " Dr Jusuf says . <p> " By understanding and copying how zebrafish regenerate nerve cells , we hope to benefit patients suffering traumatic spinal cord injury in an accident , or conditions that destroy brain tissue such as Parkinson 's or Alzheimer 's disease , " she adds . <p> However , once successfully activated , glia still need to regenerate the correct nerve cell to restore appropriate function , as many disorders specifically affect distinct nerve cell types . Each of these may require precise re-expression of different sets of genes , which could complicate this process enormously , given the many different types we possess . <p> In order to better understand this process of cell specification , Dr Jusuf and her team , including researchers from the Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute at Monash University , removed specific nerve cells in the zebrafish retina , and tracked activated glia throughout the repair process . <p> Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the existing glia are able to take cues from their environment , and sense which cell is needed to be produced for efficient repair . <p> " We found that regenerating glia were incredibly adaptive .

Glia then switched back to making all five retinal nerve cell types , thus constantly adjusting and fine tuning their regenerative response to ultimately restore appropriate cell type ratios , " says Dr Jusuf . <p> This incredible dynamic ability of glia means that once activated within the injured tissue , regenerative processes could restore the correct proportion of nerve cell types without further genetic intervention , regardless of the injury or cell type lost . <p> The next step for Dr Jusuf 's team is to work out ' cues ' that these glia use to successfully regenerate specific nerve cells , such as those lost in different visual diseases including retinitis pigmentosa and glaucoma . <p> To do this , and other related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first zebrafish focussed laboratory .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> What 's wrong with Venezuela 's Constituent Assembly ? <p> The highly controversial new body may have been established under the guise of democracy , but it is actually a superficial cover for maintaining the President 's power <p> By Dr William Partlett , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Venezuela is currently undergoing a political and constitutional crisis . <p> The recent election of a new Constituent Assembly has drawn international condemnation and accusations of fraud and vote rigging , and is seen by many as an attempt by President Nicolas Maduro to strengthen his grip on power . <p> The increasingly fractured country is suffering from recession , inflation and shortages of food and medicine , with many calling for a change of government . The Opposition , which controls the existing legislature , boycotted the recent Constituent Assembly elections , calling them ' unconstitutional ' . Human Rights Watch has called it a " sham " and the United States has placed sanctions on Venezuela . <p> The new National Constituent Assembly in Venezuela is supportive of controversial president Nicolas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this by arguing that the elected Constituent Assembly is a democratic way to bring peace to the country . This raises a key question : how can allowing the people to have their say be undemocratic ? <p> Many media reports have focused on the failure to hold a referendum on the Constituent Assembly and the continued protests . Others have focused on ballot rigging and the decision by the opposition to boycott the election . <p> But there is another critical -- but largely neglected -- reason why this National Constituent Assembly is problematic . The answer lies in the details of the electoral rules for the Assembly . President Maduro used his control over the electoral laws for this Constituent Assembly to significantly amplify his support . <p> These rules help us understand why the opposition boycotted these elections in the first place .

In the United States , elected constitutional conventions played a critical role in the adoption of the constitution ( and in some of the states as well ) . In France , the National Assembly became the chief constitution-making body . <p> This practice remains in wide use today . Formal constitutional change and replacement in the American states has made wide use of elected constitutional conventions . Article Five of the United States Constitution contains a provision allowing for calling " a convention to propose amendments . " <p> Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez established a temporary National Constituent Assembly in 1999 . Picture : Wikimedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary constituent assemblies have been at the forefront of democratic change . Across the region , democratic constitutions specify constituent assemblies to be called for the drafting of new constitutions . Perhaps the most successful example was the Constituent Assembly convened in Colombia to draft its new constitution in 1991 . President Maduro has appealed heavily to this tradition in calling the current Constituent Assembly . <h> Constituent Assemblies in Practice <p> These temporary bodies , however , can be manipulated for anti-democratic ends . <p> First , because they are temporary ad hoc bodies called into existence at times of constitutional change , the selection rules ( electoral rules ) are not already set . This uncertainty frequently allows powerful political actors ( often presidents ) to manipulate the electoral rules to advantage their own supporters . There is precedent for this in Venezuela . In 1999 , newly-elected President Hugo Chavez single-handedly drafted the rules for a temporary National Constituent Assembly . These rules skewed in his favour and helped him dominate the Assembly ( which is now held in majority by the opposition ) . <p> Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituent assemblies can then claim the power to do more than just propose new constitutional text . Instead , they can reshape the entire institutional landscape before they propose a new constitution . Because they represent " the people " in drafting new constitutions , they can claim to possess inherent " runaway " powers to issue binding laws , remove government officials , or disband pre-existing institutions . <p> In 1999 , the Assembly claimed in its founding statute , that " The Assembly , in the exercise of its inherent powers , may limit or decide to cease the activities of the authorities that make up the Public Power . " <h> Venezuela 's 2017 Constituent Assembly <p> President Maduro has taken advantage of both of these factors in the establishment of the new assembly . First , he drafted the electoral rules to amplify his support . The Assembly has 545 members : 364 territorial members and 181 " sectoral " members . For the territorial seats , Maduro wrote the rules in order to ensure that rural districts ( where his support is greatest ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The vast bulk of municipalities are rural , while the vast bulk of Venezuelans live in a relative handful of urban municipalities . " This malapportionment technique skewed seats in favour of Maduro . <p> Maduro also drafted the rules for the sectoral seats to suit his own interests . These seats represent different sectors of the economy , including workers , farmers and fishermen and fisherwomen , students , people with disabilities , indigenous people , pensioners , businessmen and businesswomen . To be elected to one of these sectoral seats , one has to be " certified . " These certified seats allow Maduro significant opportunities for manipulation . <p> Second , President Maduro is claiming this body stands above the existing constituted powers such as the legislature . In a televised address the evening before the vote , he described the Assembly as " a power that 's above and beyond every other . It 's the super power ! " . And , since convening , the Constituent Assembly has claimed the power to remove the Attorney General from power . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming legal authority to dismantle the elected legislature and to reshape the political landscape before a new constitution is passed . <h> Hiding behind democratic rhetoric <p> President Maduro was taking few risks in calling an elected Constituent Assembly despite his growing unpopularity . On top of vote rigging and suppression of debate , he has even sought to ensure that the electoral rules were in his favour . This is a powerful reminder that democracy is really found in the details . <p> And these details are a key way to see through the democratic rhetoric around this Constituent Assembly to its actual goal : to dismantle the institutional basis for Venezuela 's University 's Privacy Officer at **30;502;TOOLONG

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Surgeons go green : Recycling general anaesthetic <p> The development of a new technology that captures potentially damaging anaesthetics could lead to recycling the cleanest , rarest and safest anaesthetic gases known to medicine <p> By Kate Cole-Adams , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> One of the paradoxes of the medical marvel known as general anaesthesia is that in helping us to get well , those anaesthetic gases are also heating our planet . Now , a remedy may be at hand in the form of an innocuous-looking white powder developed by University of Melbourne scientists . <p> Every year more than 300 million major operations take place in hospitals around the world . Each has the potential to greatly improve or even save a life , yet many rely on gases that , as well as making patients unconscious , contribute to global warming . Some of these gases are thousands of times more potent than our best-known greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide . <p> University of Melbourne researchers have captured and stored two inhalation anaesthetics , isoflurane and sevoflurane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mid-sized hospital has been estimated to produce greenhouse gases equivalent to up to 1200 cars , " the global warming potential is considerable , " says University of Melbourne researcher Associate Professor Brendan Abrahams . <p> And it is not only the environment that is at risk . During surgical anaesthesia , some of these gases leak into operating theatres and veterinary clinics where , over time , they may pose health risks ( occupational exposure to anaesthetic gases has been linked to inflammatory responses in theatre staff ) . <p> But the vast majority of these gases are expelled from patients ' lungs and flushed outside into the atmosphere where they act to trap heat . <p> Imagine then that these gases could be somehow captured , stored and maybe even recycled ? Besides helping tackle global warming and the health of workers , might this make it possible to dramatically reduce surgical costs ? <p> Imagine , too , a technology that could not only capture potentially damaging gases , but that could even be used to harvest from patients ' lungs one of the cleanest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas that has no known impact on either the environment or surgical staff . <p> This is one of those serendipitous science stories that began not with a problem looking for an answer , but with an answer just waiting for the right problem to come along . <p> The groundwork was laid the late 1980s when University of Melbourne chemist Professor Richard Robson pioneered a new technology that allowed scientists to design and generate materials known as co-ordination polymers , which contain holes large enough to hold small molecules . The inspiration for this research came from the construction of molecular models which Professor Robson designed for use in undergraduate chemistry lectures in the 1970s . <p> To the naked eye , it looks a little like white crystalline powder or perhaps fine sand . But zoom in and what you see is something that might more closely resemble an IKEA storage cabinet -- a sort of molecular scaffolding . <p> The " molecular scaffolding " structure of the coordination polymer , which is able to accommodate anaesthetic molecules within the square channels .

Many have also shown unusual and possibly useful magnetic and electronic properties . <p> Fast forward 20 years or so to University House , and the spring of 2012 . Dr Abrahams is having coffee with a colleague . They are chatting about co-ordination polymers that the team have already created to see if they can be used to separate and store CO2 molecules ( it turns out they can , but not at commercially viable prices ) . <p> Then Dr Abrahams ' colleague , Dr Paul Donnelly , has another idea . Part of his own research involves anaesthetising mice ; now he wonders out loud whether the technology could be repurposed . <p> " Have you ever thought about using these to capture anaesthetic gases ? " <p> The team have since developed a new family of " tuneable " polymers that can be tailored to fit individual anaesthetic gases . Big holes for big molecules , snugger holes for smaller ones . <p> They have managed to capture and store two commonly-used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn their attention to another popular vapour , desflurane . The researchers have already established that once the gases are captured , the co-ordination polymers can be reheated slightly until they release the vapour into an apparatus where it then cools down and condenses back into liquid form . <p> Ideally , says Dr Abrahams , the next step is to see if the gases can be recycled ( the molecules are just molecules , so it makes no difference how many sets of lungs they pass through ) , reducing waste and costs . <p> Then there is xenon . Considered by some the perfect anaesthetic , this inert gas is non-explosive , non-flammable , relatively non-toxic -- and does n't damage the environment . The problem is that it is rare - 87 parts per billion . And expensive . The team have managed to capture xenon with their co-ordination polymers , and hope this might eventually boost the gas 's use in operating rooms . <p> PhD student David Dharma trials the coordination polymers in an operating theatre at Melbourne 's Western General Hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the xenon back from the patient , then it may become economically viable , " says Dr Abrahams . <p> The group has recently filed a patent and Dr Abrahams is now seeking funding to develop the technology on a commercial scale and explore the possibilities for recycling the captured anaesthetic gases . <p> " We 're hopeful that this basic chemical research might translate into a commercially viable and environmentally helpful product .

It 's also increasingly common . Dementia is now the second leading cause of death in Australia . <p> There is no cure , but researchers , including Professor Felicity Baker , co-director of the University of Melbourne 's National Music Therapy Research Unit , are looking for new ways to help people cope . <p> Professor Baker studies how music , especially singing and songwriting , can be used to treat people with a range of conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with substance abuse issues . She says music therapy can be a way for people living with dementia -- and their carers -- to deal with its symptoms . <p> Professor Baker ( right ) is leading a study into the impact of music therapy on people with dementia .

" We need to be creative in finding ways that people with dementia can manage the challenges they face , and to address distressing symptoms such as agitation and depression . " <p> Professor Baker recently developed a songwriting program for people living with dementia and their carers at Caladenia , a care centre based in Melbourne 's eastern suburbs . Participants worked together in small groups to write and compose songs with a music therapist . <p> In one 10-week session , participants wrote seven songs . They sang about family , cruise ship holidays and staying out until the sun comes up .

" <p> But what really struck Professor Baker was that participants remembered the music they created . <p> " There 's this assumption that people with dementia ca n't learn , that they 're just losing memories , " says Professor Baker . " But what we found is that they were actually remembering lyrics from week to week . " <p> Professor Baker 's findings will be used to inform her next project , a large-scale study funded by a grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council .

The simple act of listening to a song can evoke memories and emotions of heartbreak , love affairs , places or people in our past . And scientists , too , have long known that music has a powerful effect on brain function . <p> Unlike other stimulants , Professor Baker says , music engages all parts of our brain . <p> " When we engage in some activities , specific neural networks are activated . But when we listen to music , we actually engage quite a distributed network of neuronal activity . " <p> Professor Baker was struck by how residents at Caladenia Dementia Care could remember the lyrics they wrote to songs from week to week . Picture : Supplied <p> Studies have also shown that the act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument -- is more effective in stimulating our brain than just listening to music . In other words , it 's more stimulating to write and sing a song than listen to your favourite album . <p> " The theory is that pairing music and lyrics with an emotional experience can reach the threshold for memory , " she says . " It connects people and helps them to remember . " <p> A 2009 study by the University of California , Davis , for example , found that the area of the brain that holds our memories and links music to emotions is also the last part of the brain to atrophy during Alzheimer 's disease , the most common form of dementia . <p> Professor Baker 's research project is the Australian arm of a much larger study into the effects of music therapy on people living with dementia . Work in Australia will involve 500 participants , but academic colleagues in Norway are leading similar and even larger initiatives . <p> " It 's going to be the biggest music therapy study in dementia care ever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . <p> Previous literary reviews about the effects of music therapy have been promising but inconclusive , citing the need for larger studies and more evidence . <p> " Worldwide , we have amassed a lot of small scale studies that show it 's effective but nothing big that will help us be taken more seriously when healthcare policies are being made . " <p> The NHMRC grant used to fund Professor Baker 's research is part of the Boosting Dementia Research Initiative , which gives $200 million to dementia research projects , including several other studies based at the University of Melbourne .

Picture : Wikimedia <p> The findings , published in the Journal of Experimental Biology , raise significant welfare issues and may also explain the poor survival of farmed hatchlings in conservation programs . <p> Scientists from the University of Melbourne looked at salmon farmed in Norway , Chile , Scotland , Canada and Australia and found the deformity was widespread . <p> The study 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went looking for the cause of the deformity they found that the fastest-growing fish were three times more likely to be afflicted than the slowest , even at the same age . <p> " We also found that we could reduce the incidence of the deformity by reducing how fast a fish grew . Such a clear result was unprecedented , " says Ms Tormey , a masters graduate from the School of BioSciences at the University of Melbourne . <p> The deformity occurs in the otoliths explains Ms Reimer , which are tiny crystals in a fish 's inner ear that detect sound , much like the ear bones in humans . So even a small change can cause massive hearing problems . <p> She says normal otoliths are made of the mineral ' aragonite ' , but deformed otoliths are partly made of ' vaterite ' which is lighter , larger , and less stable . <p> The team showed that fish afflicted with vaterite could lose up to 50 per cent of their hearing . <p> Otoliths have been used for decades to determine a wild fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and life history of farmed fish is always known , there has never been a reason to examine them . <p> The deformation was first recorded in the 1960s , but in 2016 this team was the first to show it affects more than 95 per cent of fully-grown hatchery-produced fish globally . <p> Study co-author Associate Professor Tim Dempster says that the deformity is irreversible , and its effects only get worse with age . <p> " These results raise serious questions about the welfare of farmed fish . In many countries , farming practices must allow for the ' Five Freedoms ' , which are freedom from hunger or thirst ; freedom from discomfort ; freedom from pain , injury or disease ; freedom to express ( most ) normal behaviour ; and freedom from fear and distress , " says Dr Dempster , from the University of Melbourne . <p> The issue is that farmed salmon lead very different lives to wild salmon . <p> Generations of selective breeding have created fish that are genetically distinct from their wild ancestors .

One strategy used to boost stocks is to release millions of farmed juveniles into spawning rivers . <p> Farmed juveniles are often larger than their wild peers at the same age , and would theoretically stand a better chance of surviving . <p> However , the actual survival rate of farmed juveniles is between ten and 20 times lower than that of wild salmon .

This immobilised nitrogen would then be available across the growing season for the crop . <p> " We have all seen the images of the destruction from blue-green algae in our rivers . The cost to rectify this ecological disaster is enormous . Another well-known example is excessive nutrients from fertilisers running off into the Great Barrier Reef , " says Professor Chen . <p> Around 50 per cent of nitrogen applied to cropping farmland is lost to the environment , and that increases to around 70 per cent in cattle feedlots .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Merkel 's refugee stance paying off ahead of German election <p> German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's re-election prospects once looked shaky amid criticism of her " open door " refugee policy , but her leadership on refugees is paying dividends at home <p> By Tamara , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Angela Merkel , the leader of the Germany 's ruling centre-right CDU/CSU coalition , is widely expected to win a fourth ( and final ) term as German Chancellor in parliamentary elections on September 24 . <p> If she does win , Germany 's first female Chancellor and the longest serving leader in the western world will extend her rule for another four years . <p> Opinion polls suggest Dr Merkel will win easily . Recent polls indicate support for the CDU/CSU is around at 40 per cent ; with a 15 per cent lead over the next serious contender the Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) , led by former European Parliament President Martin Schulz . <p> ' If Europe fails on the question of refugees , then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr Merkel said when she declared that all Syrians would be eligible to apply for refugee status in Germany .

At present , Australians who want to buy books online must weigh up the added cost and delay of postage rates and delivery speed . For example , the Book Depository , which was acquired by Amazon in 2011 , offers comparatively long delivery times but free shipping to Australia while Australian e-tailer Booktopia offers faster delivery but with a small postage fee .

This means it is able to influence consumer purchasing decisions , and can consequently negotiate aggressively for discounted stock from publishers . <p> This will place pressure on all Australian publishers regardless of size . With Amazon on the ground to handle distribution alongside its international reach , there will also be a stronger incentive for Australian authors to turn to Amazon and self-publish . This may lead to a fragmentation of the expertise currently concentrated in publishing houses . <p> Editing , for example , has traditionally taken place within the publisher 's office , but will increasingly become a freelance service that authors can purchase on an as-needs basis .

 <p> New trade rules for wine and spirits that are likely to be incorporated into international trade agreements may mean it is harder to get health warnings onto alcohol labels . It is a move at odds with global health experts who are calling for more effective health warnings and nutrition information on alcohol to enable consumers to make healthy choices . <p> The new rules mean that wine and spirits suppliers would be allowed to place country-specific information on a supplementary label rather than the main label . <p> For example , if Australia requires a health warning , a wine producer in another country would be able to meet this requirement by displaying the health warning on an extra label , rather than having to change its main label . <p> The move is intended to reduce the burden on manufacturers , making it easier for them to comply with different labelling requirements in different countries .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Isolating mercury to protect food chains <p> Not all mercury is the same , and a new automated technique has slashed the time needed to determine the bio-accessibility of different forms of toxic mercury in the environment <p> By Dr Daryl Holland , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Mercury gets a bad rap , and rightly so . It is incredibly toxic to many organisms , and it accumulates in the food chain . That means animals at the top of the food chain , including us humans , often get the highest doses . <p> To minimise the risk to humans and other living things we need to be able to accurately and efficiently measure concentrations of mercury in the environment . <p> The problem is mercury comes in many forms and is a slippery customer to track . <p> But researchers from the University of Melbourne and the University of the Balearic Islands in Spain have developed a new automated technique to isolate different forms of mercury based on the risk of each form moving into the food chain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quicksilver , which is pure mercury , but Professor Spas Kolev says that this makes up just a very small fraction of the mercury found in the environment . <p> " Mercury that ends up in the environment takes other forms such as mercury sulfide , methylmercury , dimethylmercury , ethylmercury and phenylmercury , " says Professor Kolev , from the School of Chemistry at the University of Melbourne . <p> " Some of these forms are much more toxic than others , and some are more mobile than others , meaning they can move through the environment and can into humans more easily . <p> " Methylmercury for example , easily dissolves in water and can easily get into plants , fish and other animals , while mercury sulfide tends to stay locked in sediment and soil and is much less likely to get into the food chain . <p> " Just knowing the total concentration of mercury in the environment does n't give us enough information to determine the risk to humans .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> North Korea : The ' threat that leaves something to chance ' <p> North Korea 's latest missile test has graphically demonstrated that in an escalating nuclear crisis it could be the ' threat that leaves something to chance ' <p> By Dr Marko Beljac , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> By firing a ballistic missile over Japan while the US and South Korea are engaged in joint military exercises , North Korea has provided an important insight into how strategic nuclear dynamics could likely play out on the Korean peninsula . <p> There now exists a very real prospect that the nuclear crisis may spiral out of control . And , Pyongyang may seek to deliberately cultivate just such a danger . <p> The ballistic missile that overflew Japan on 29 August is the Hwasong-12 , an Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile . We are fairly sure of this because the maximum altitude , about 550 kilometres , is similar to what one would expect of a Hwasong-12 fired on a standard minimum energy trajectory . The missile also flew 2,700 kilometres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maximum range of about 4,500 kilometres . <p> The Hwasong-12 forms the first stage of the two-part Hwasong-14 ICBM , which was successfully tested on 4 July and 28 July . Ballistic missiles with strategic nuclear payloads must be reliable , as well as being seen to be reliable , if they are to serve as credible nuclear deterrents . <p> The partial success of the latest Hwasong-12 test means we should expect more Hwasong-14 ICBM tests soon , perhaps also over-flying Japan . This is because missiles tested on a standard trajectory provide more insight into the survivability of the re-entry vehicle -- which protects the nuclear warhead from the rigours of re-entry into the atmosphere -- compared with the highly-lofted trajectories that North Korea has used so far . <p> Doubtless the North Koreans would have been disappointed that the Hwasong-12 broke up , as Pyongyang 's scientists could have learnt more regarding re-entry vehicle dynamics from a successful standard trajectory test . <p> Some commentators have speculated that both the Hwasong-12 and Hwasong-14 first stage are essentially powered by the Soviet-era RD-250 family of liquid-propellant engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not accurate . <p> The first stage engine for both missiles has similarities with the RD-250 , but some important features are not shared . They have some elements in common with early Chinese missile and rocket engines , and those which are shared with the RD-250 are more reflective of engineers hitting upon the same solutions to the same problems . <p> North Korea has developed its more advanced missile capabilities largely indigenously , and any assessment of the strategic situation on the Korean peninsula can not be based on wishful thinking regarding the scientific capabilities of North Korea . <p> Those days have now passed . North Korea has , or is very close to having , the ability to fire a nuclear weapon on the US mainland . <p> The Hwasong-12 test of August 29 , unlike any other , shows us how nuclear dynamics will work on the Korean peninsula . Theoretical analysis regarding the rational basis of nuclear deterrence suggests that it can be made most credible via two means . <p> North Korea has or will have the ability to fire a nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through possession of overwhelming strategic firepower and flexible nuclear employment doctrines geared toward controlling escalation . This means that it is theoretically possible to limit damage to oneself , even when the nuclear threshold has been crossed - and this possibility makes deterrence credible because an opponent will always suffer more in any nuclear conflict . <p> North Korea does not have overwhelming strategic firepower . That is a quality Washington possesses . <p> North Korea , through its provocative actions , graphically demonstrates that in a crisis it would be quite prepared to manipulate external perceptions of risk . The Soviet Union and China were , and in the case of China remain , highly risk-averse nuclear powers . <p> But North Korea is showing that in a crisis it wo n't be nearly as risk averse . The outcome of a crisis then essentially becomes a matter of chance . A game of Russian roulette . <p> This posture would conflict with a key US concern , namely the credibility of extended deterrence . Washington provides South Korea and Japan with a nuclear umbrella , but when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Would the US be prepared to give up Los Angeles and San Francisco for Seoul and Tokyo ? <p> In a crisis , the US must demonstrate that its deterrent extended to Japan and South Korea is credible , and that means Washington must show , and be seen to show , resolve . <p> Putting Pyongyang 's " threat that leaves something to chance " and Washington 's concerns about the credibility of extended deterrence together in a crisis provides for an explosive mix potentially as potent as any critical mass of plutonium . <p> We should not simply accept a nuclear North Korea through a misplaced belief in the stability of nuclear deterrence , or the inadequacies of North Korea 's technical capabilities . Any military options - and there has never really been many - have by now become almost wholly irrational . <p> That means diplomacy is the best means to eliminate nuclear danger on the Korean peninsula , and recent statements from Pyongyang have suggested they are willing to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula . <p> We should put North Korean diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University 's Privacy Officer at **30;174;TOOLONG

Let 's eavesdrop on experts changing the world - one lecture , one experiment , one interview at a time . <p> Every child deserves to go to their local school . But more and more we 're seeing concentrations of learning difficulties in some schools and not others . What 's the best way for teachers to accommodate students with learning difficulties so they can achieve just as much as their peers ? <p> Dr Shiralee from the Melbourne Graduate School of Education has over 30 years experience teaching in Australian state , Catholic and independent primary and secondary schools . She 's worked in education policy and teaches in Master of Teaching at the University of Melbourne . Dr Shiralee Poed chats with Steve Grimwade about her approach to disability in the classroom and how to equip teachers with the tools to make a positive impact on students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit about your work . What is it that you 've been exploring ? <p> SHIRALEE Well my role here at the University of Melbourne is I train teachers who work with children with disabilities but what I 'm really interested in exploring is how we can improve educational outcomes for kids with disabilities in our school . So what I did through my PhD was I studied court cases that involved kids with disabilities and I looked at the sorts of issues that families had in terms of the provisions being made for their child . <p> STEVE What sort of issues were they facing ? <p> SHIRALEE There a wide range of issues . The things that I was most interested in were the problems that kids were having in accessing the curriculum . It was whether the work was too difficult for them and the teachers were n't making adjustments or whether they needed some special consideration so that they could show on an exam that they knew the material but they were n't able to do that in the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read recently that teachers assistants themselves were n't necessarily a sign that your child , if they were disabled or they had some difficulty in learning , were n't necessarily going to provide greater outcomes . Could you talk to that a bit ? <p> SHIRALEE This came from a dean 's lecture that we had here at the Melbourne Graduate School for Education where we had a person come over from the UK who had done some extensive study into the use of teacher assistants in mainstream schools in the UK . <p> From his study he found that teacher assistants were n't making much of a difference in terms of the child 's educational outcomes . They might have helped kids with their self esteem and they might have helped kids feel more confident in the classroom but in terms of getting better grades it was n't making much of a difference . <p> But he wrapped some information around that by saying things like our teacher assistants typically are the least trained people who work in our schools and are often asked to work well beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and that it 's really the classroom teacher 's responsibility to ensure that the program that 's being provided for the child with a disability is that they 're responsible for that program and that they 're working and providing advice to the teacher assistants so that they can provide the best support for that child . <p> STEVE When you 're working with teachers themselves to better support those children what are your key messages ? <p> SHIRALEE We have a few messages . I 'm responsible for two key subjects here at the University of Melbourne . One is called promoting positive learning . In that subject we look specifically at the interventions that we know work when you 're working with a child with a disability . We train teachers to use those interventions in their classroom and to use them correctly . The other subject that I 'm responsible for is called promoting positive behaviour and it looks at the interventions that we know work when you have a child who has behaviours of concern . <p> STEVE That 's for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interventions that classroom teachers will use in their classrooms . We do n't have a focus here on parents but through my thesis I did have a look at some of the issues that families were having with the education sector . <p> STEVE What was it that made you enter this area ? Was it a particular child ? Was it a teacher ? Was it an experience ? <p> SHIRALEE It actually came from a different job that I did . Prior to coming to the University of Melbourne I worked in Queensland and one of the previous roles that I had in Queensland was I was a policy advisor for the Queensland Government . My responsibility was the portfolio around students with a disability and policies that were meant to support kids with a disability . <p> One of the tasks that I frequently had to do was if there was a court case involving a child with a disability where a parent had alleged discrimination against their child , the Department 's legal team requested that I would look at whether the school had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions of the school in themselves were discriminatory . <p> That got me interested in whether we could improve the way that teachers understood policy so that when they 're in their classroom they 're able to provide the best options for kids . <p> STEVE It also presumes a little bit that best compliance equals best outcome . <p> SHIRALEE It does but then that 's the responsibility of a good policy writer , to understand schools in context and to make sure that they write a policy that can work for teachers in classrooms . <p> STEVE GRIMWADE Given your work in government and now your work as an academic how 's it been combining your practical experience and your research ? Have these complemented each other ? It sounds like they have . <p> SHIRALEE I feel that they have . I feel that when I work with classroom teachers because I 've spent a lot of time working in schools and because I 've had that opportunity to work in a policy role it gives me the practical knowledge that allows me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and help teachers to make sense of that and what it looks like in their classrooms . <p> STEVE GRIMWADE Given those two pincer movements to effecting great change - one in policy , one in teaching teachers - are you find you 're having more affect in one of those two areas ? <p> SHIRALEE I 'm really lucky here at the University of Melbourne because I have a unique role . I 've been here since 2011 but for the last two years the university allowed me to work directly with the Department of Education and Training . So I was based in the Department of Education and Training and my job was to provide training to schools in a particular framework that we know that helps children with disabilities but actually helps all children in schools and it helps teachers respond to kids in a consistent way . <p> That practical experience over the last two years has really allowed me to understand Victorian schools and their context . So coming back here to the University of Melbourne this year and into a full time lecturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the last two years . <p> STEVE In your research recently or over the period what findings have surprised you ? <p> SHIRALEE From my PhD study I think the thing that surprised me the most - I looked at 92 court cases that involved 54 Australian kids with disabilities and the biggest surprise that I got from that was that only around a third of families who put forward a legal claim of discrimination are successful . <p> If you think about that the other way , two thirds of families who put forward a legal claim of discrimination are unsuccessful which means we have this group of parents who get to the point of such levels of dissatisfaction that they feel like their only option is a legal pathway . I 'm really interested in what we can do that prevents us from having to go down that way in the future . <p> Most of my work now is looking at what can we do to change the behaviour of either children or their families or teachers or principals or even policy writers so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution for people who are dissatisfied . <p> STEVE GRIMWADE To study that area , it 's the pointy end , it 's the hard end of discrimination once it gets to a court case but surely most acts of discrimination are n't going to court at all ? <p> SHIRALEE That 's true . There 's a figure that was produced , and I 'm uncertain how they created that figure , but they suggest that about 93 per cent of cases are mediated before they get to court . So around seven per cent of cases actually make it to court . <p> The difficulty for us as academics is that mediated cases are n't available publicly so it 's very hard to learn about the mediation process and what it was that helped solve those issues . So we can only learn from those cases that make it to court because those decisions are published but you 're right . Only about seven per cent actually get to that case where they go all the way through a legal claim . <p> STEVE I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way . What 's some good advice that you 've been given along the way ? <p> SHIRALEE I 've been really lucky . I have a couple of very good mentors . I find academia sometimes a challenge particularly because I like the more practical side of working in schools and working directly with teachers . <p> A very good mentor of mine is Professor George Sugai from the University of Connecticut . He 's the world leader in this framework that I train schools to use called Positive Behaviours Interventions and Supports . George provided me a piece of advice to help me as an academic which sits on my wall in my office . It has five dot points to it . The first one is that , as an academic , we need to work hard but the second part is we need to play hard . We also need to make sure that we keep time for family and that 's really important in all roles that involve teaching because those roles can become consuming . <p> But the biggest piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my wall is that every decision that I make in terms of where I put my energy and time has children as my first criterion . If it helps improve educational outcomes for kids with disabilities I 'll always say yes to doing that work . It the primary focus is n't about kids with disabilities it 's easy to say no . <p> STEVE GRIMWADE Now we 're talking specifically about kids with disabilities but , again , I 'm not sure what percentage we 're talking about in the school system . <p> SHIRALEE Well that varies depending on the criteria that we use to define a disability but we know that in Australian schools anywhere between three per cent of children with disabilities and around 10 per cent of children with disabilities receive additional resourcing to help teachers accommodate their needs . <p> But if we use a broader definition of disability , and that is children who have some condition that prevents them from learning at the same rate as their peers , it can be as high as 20 to 25 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , who have an ongoing chronic medical condition that means they miss a lot of their schooling . It can be children who learn differently to their peers and therefore because of that learning disability it also affects their learning . So it could be up to a quarter of any teacher 's classroom represented by kids who require additional support to help them with their learning . <p> STEVE That 's an amazingly high figure and one that may not be understood by the other 75 per cent . So I 'm interested , being a parent of a school aged kid , parents talk obsessively about schools and what we want for our kids . What would you like us to talk about next time we 're talking about kids ' education more generally ? <p> SHIRALEE That 's a really good question and parents will often worry about the impact of a child with a disability in their child 's classroom and they 'll worry about the impact that that will have on their kid 's learning . <p> If I give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick and they went to a doctor and the doctor listened to their symptoms and then every child who left that doctor got a Band-Aid on their arm that would n't be a good medical intervention . If a child came in with a cold and they got a Band-Aid and then another child came in with a sore toe and they all got a Band-Aid on their arm that would n't be a good solution . <p> Teachers have to think about interventions in the same way that the medical profession think about it . Every child who comes into that classroom at a different point will have a different need . Children who have disabilities will have ongoing needs but kids who do n't have disabilities will have needs from time to time . It 's the role of the classroom teacher to think about what 's the best intervention to help every kid progress in their learning . <p> John Hattie here in the Melbourne Graduate School of Education always talks about every child deserves to make one year 's learning growth in a year of schooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how they can make that happen . <p> STEVE That seems to gel with the message I 'm hearing from public schools . That 's what they 're trying to teach . They 're not trying to teach one thing to all kids . <p> SHIRALEE I think so . I think teachers have worked really hard since the early to mid-80s looking at how they can differentiate for the diversity of learners that exist in classrooms . <p> STEVE GRIMWADE Australians talk about the My School website which ranks schools and then it uses I think - it measures kids with disabilities or it puts an asterisk beside their names at times . Can you maybe speak to that because I 'm not describing it correctly but I know it 's in the back of my mind ? <p> SHIRALEE I 've been fairly critical of the My Schools ' website for that reason . I think it 's really important that every neighbourhood school accepts the children who live in that neighbourhood . So therefore every neighbourhood school should have a proportion of kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our neighbourhoods that 's not true . So we have still , to this day , some schools who will encourage families who have a child with a disability that there 's another neighbourhood school that would be better for their child . <p> When you have that sort of inequity happening comparing schools in terms of performance is very difficult . We know that there are some schools who attract very large enrolments of kids with disabilities because the teachers there do a great job . So when you have a ranking system like My Schools that 's a risk within that ranking system . <p> Now there 's been some talk in the past about excluding out the data that involves kids with disabilities but I see that that exacerbates the problem . I think what we need to do is address the issue that every child deserves to go to their local neighbourhood school . <p> STEVE I do n't want to embarrass you here but you 've won your fair share of teaching and research awards over the years . What 's helped you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself for students or researchers ? <p> SHIRALEE I 've won a few teaching awards . I 've not won many research but I have won one . In terms of teaching awards I think my experience of being a classroom teacher and having worked in varying roles in education have really helped me . But I 've also had great mentoring and really good people that I 've learnt from along the way . <p> I think if you 're an early career teacher one of the things to ensure that you do is wrap around yourself people who can really support you and help you be a better teacher each day . I think the same is true when people come into academia . It 's finding those people who can support you to improve your teaching . <p> As a researcher I 'm very early career as a researcher and I certainly do n't have a lengthy publication record but my PhD was well supported by my supervisors and I spent a long time doing it because to me it was an important topic and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks to Dr Shiralee from the Melbourne Graduate School of Education .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Thunderstorm asthma : Counting pollen to save lives <p> This year 's dry winter is good news for Melbourne 's hay fever sufferers , but after last year 's thunderstorm asthma event claimed nine lives , there are never any guarantees when it comes to pollen <p> By Dr Daryl Holland , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> As Melbourne slowly moves from winter into spring , most locals look forward to putting away their winter coats and spending more time outdoors , enjoying the longer , warmer days . <p> But for hay fever sufferers , spring means pollen - especially grass pollen . This can trigger serious allergies in many , and in rare cases can be fatal . For hay fever sufferers and asthmatics , the Melbourne Pollen Count is an indispensable resource to help manage their symptoms and protect their health . <p> The University of Melbourne has been collecting grass pollen data for more than 20 years and , from the start of October through to the end of December , provides daily grass pollen forecasts . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forecast so they can take preventative measures , like taking antihistamines , or staying indoors . <h> THIS YEAR 'S OUTLOOK <p> Associate Professor Newbigin , who leads the Melbourne Pollen Count team , says it is hard to estimate the hay fever outlook for the coming pollen season because it is so dependent on local weather conditions , but the weather over winter offers an indication of how much grass there is likely to be . <p> " Winter has been drier and warmer than average , which means it will probably be a pretty poor grass pollen season , " he says . <p> Good news for hay fever sufferers , but it comes with a proviso . <p> " Last year we thought it would be an average grass pollen year , and it was , " says Associate Professor Newbigin . <p> " Except for that one period in late November , with thunderstorm asthma . " <h> WHEN HAY FEVER BECOMES DEADLY <p> Around 5:30 pm on November 21 , 2016 , a line of thunderstorms and showers that moved eastwards across Melbourne brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief . <p> The thunderstorm that hit Melbourne on November 21 2016 triggered a major health crisis , with thousands of people experiencing asthma attacks . Picture : Sean <p> Thunderstorm asthma is thought to be triggered by a unique combination of high grass pollen levels and a certain type of thunderstorm . Grass pollen grains get swept up in the wind and carried for long distances . Pollen can break up and release tiny particles that are concentrated in the wind gusts that come just before a thunderstorm . These particles are small enough to be inhaled deep into the lungs and can trigger asthma symptoms , making it difficult to breathe . <p> Nine deaths have reportedly been associated with last year 's thunderstorm asthma event . At the time , hospitals , ambulance services and the health system generally was overwhelmed by thousands of people suffering severe asthma attacks . <p> Some of these people had never previously suffered an asthma attack , although they typically suffered from hay fever and were allergic to grass pollen . <p> " This was the worst thunderstorm asthma event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know , " says Associate Professor Newbigin . <p> " Every single ambulance in the state was on the road that night . " <h> THUNDERSTORM ASTHMA : A COMPLEX PROBLEM <p> As bad as November 21 was , it was far from Victoria 's first experience of thunderstorm asthma . <p> Dr Jeremy Silver , an atmospheric modeller in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne , has been analysing historical asthma presentation data in Victoria . <p> " In Melbourne , we 've identified at least six thunderstorm asthma events over the last 33 years , " he says . <p> Thunderstorm asthma usually occurs between late October and the end of November and is almost always associated with high grass pollen levels in the air . <p> " During these events we can see that there is a sharp spike in the number of people turning up at hospitals with asthma . This happens in Melbourne and in some of the regional hospitals , and is particularly bad in the north of the state , " he says . <p> " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly a contributing factor , but there are plenty of days with high grass pollen levels without an asthma spike , and some high asthma days with low grass pollen levels , " he says . <p> The Victorian State Government has since committed AUD$15 million to develop a monitoring system to forecast thunderstorm asthma events so that hospitals , emergency services and those at risk of an attack can be informed . <p> But he adds that people should heed any warnings , as ignoring them could be fatal <p> Pollen count stations like this one at the University of Melbourne 's Parkville campus ( pictured ) are being installed in five locations in rural Victoria . Picture : Supplied <p> Importantly , the state government is also funding five new pollen counting stations that will be sited around rural Victoria and add to the existing station at the University of Melbourne , on top of the Earth Sciences building at its Parkville campus . <h> HOW IS YOUR HAY FEVER TODAY ? <p> Every since Dr Edwin Lampugnani joined the School of BioSciences in 2011 and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting , the Melbourne Pollen Count team has provided a daily count and forecast of levels in the air . <p> Not only does the Melbourne Pollen Count provide crucial data to the community , it is also a citizen science project , with users submitting daily information about their symptoms that are then used more clearly understand the relationship between pollen , weather and allergic University 's Privacy Officer at **30;117;TOOLONG 
 <h> Rise of the robots <p> Glyn Davis G'day , I 'm Glyn Davis , and welcome to the Policy Shop , a place where we think about policy choices . <p> Male 1 In the world that we are creating very quickly , we 're going to see more and more things that look like science fiction , and fewer and fewer things that look like jobs . Our cars are very quickly going to start driving themselves , which means we 're going to need fewer truck drivers . We 're going to hook Siri up to Watson and use that to automate a lot of the work that 's currently done by customer service reps and trouble shooters and diagnosers , and we 're already taking R2D2 , painting him orange , and putting him to work carrying shelves around warehouses , which means we need a lot fewer people to be walking up and down those aisles . <p> Male 2 What happens to people who simply ca n't acquire or do n't have the skills that are going to be needed in the new economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them ? <p> Male 2 We 're going to see much worse income inequality and unless we take some humanitarian actions , the truth is they 're going to starve and live in poverty . <p> Male 4 Technology is always creating jobs , it 's always destroying jobs , but right now the pace is accelerating , it 's faster we think than ever before in history , so , as a consequence , we are not creating jobs at the same pace that we need to . <p> Male 2 And we ai n't seen nothing yet . <p> Glyn Davis The world of work is changing fast . Economists predict that in coming years many traditional jobs and trades will be rendered obsolete - the result of automation and robotics . Some estimates suggested 45 per cent of workers currently perform tasks that will be automated in the near future . As this trend gathers pace , more than half existing jobs will disappear , and in Australia , that means up to five million lost jobs . <p> This is no distant prospect - it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across Australia sees traditional factory jobs now well below 10 per cent of the workforce . As the last car factories close , there seems little prospect of a revival in manufacturing employment . Automation is now moving into other areas , changing forever the familiar patterns of employment . <p> So joining us on the line , to discuss what the future of work might look like , is Andrew Charlton . Andrew was a senior economic advisor to the Prime Minister from 2008 ; he received his Doctorate in Economics from Oxford University , where he studied as a Rhodes Scholar . Andrew is now director at AlphaBeta , a strategic advisory business he co-founded . From Sydney , welcome Andrew . <p> Andrew Charlton Good evening Glyn . <p> Glyn Davis Also joining us today on the line is Pippa Malmgren . Pippa served as a financial market advisor to President George W. Bush , and on the National Economic Council from 2001 . She 's a co-founder of H Robotics which manufactures commercial drones , and she runs DRPM Group which provides institutional investors with advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome Pippa . <p> Pippa Malmgren Thank you . Thank you for having me . <p> Glyn Davis Pippa , can you explain a little bit about automation and how it 's affecting different industries around the world ? <p> Pippa Malmgren Well , automation is simply the process of having machines take over physical functions from human beings . Although these days , artificial intelligence means that it 's not just physical functions , it 's also computer based sort of filing functions as well . The bottom line is that actually I 'm not so sure that automation is a brand new thing . I mean we 've been automating when we invented trains , and so that was a more automotive process than going from A to B in a horse and carriage . <p> But the speed at which automation is occurring , and the breadth of things affected by it , is certainly greater today than ever before . <p> Glyn Davis Andrew your consultancy , AlphaBeta , recently published a report on automation ; can you tell us what the report says about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlton Sure . Our report looked at automation from the perspective of every one of the 20 billion hours in Australia 's economy , breaking down those hours not just by what jobs they composed of , but what tasks they composed of , and seeing how those tasks are dropping out of the Australian economy over time . <p> We found a rapid rate of change ; every Australian , on average , is losing about two hours of tasks per week to machines over each 15 year period , which is quite a lot of change when you think about it over the entire economy . <p> The nature of that change is that the most physical routine and manual types of tasks are being replaced by machine and humans are focussing on more interpersonal , creative and cognitive tasks . You see that in banks , with automatic teller machines taking out cash processing , and the workers in retail banking focussing on financial advice and interacting with customers . You see it in supermarkets , with automated check-outs and customers now spending more time helping consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not just some jobs but every job . <p> Glyn Davis Pippa talked about the long history behind automation and indeed the fear that humans will be made redundant has been expressed many times before , during the Industrial Revolution , textile workers , and most famously the Luddites , protested against the introduction of the steam engine for fear that they would take jobs . Yet in the past technology has always ended up creating more jobs than it destroys . Should we be comforted by these past experiences or is this different in kind ? Pippa ? <p> Pippa Malmgren Well I think that actually we should not be that nervous . I mean we have more people on the planet today than ever before , and we have more people in employment , levels of prosperity have been generally rising and longevity has generally been increasing . So clearly , the world economy is accommodating and making place for more people over time . I think the important thing is the economy is a constantly changing fluid thing ; I grew up surfing and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfing . <p> It 's not a fixed thing ; you ca n't choose I 'm going to do this with my career and then that 's it - you work in one place for 35 years and that 's the end of it . That happened in 50s and the 60s maybe , but it 's just no longer the way things are ; you 're going to have to move and change . My personal view is actually this is a gift , it 's a blessing , I mean who wants to work in one place doing one job for 35 years - how boring is that ? <p> What we 're going to have now is a world with much more flexibility , with permanent lifetime learning . It 's a wonderful thing that we 're going to be able to free human beings from having to do the sort of stupid end of manual labour . I mean all the people in the world economy who are lifting boxes , think of the loss of intellectual capital . Now we do n't think of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , but that 's crazy - every human being has immense latent talent and capability . We simply are n't providing enough investment , of whatever kind , to be able to bring out whatever great capabilities those people have . <p> I mean who knows who the next Steve Jobs is ? Everybody forgets his father was a Syrian immigrant who came to the US with nothing and probably was a guy lifting boxes before that . This is really a critical point ; we are about to free an immense amount of human capital because it wo n't have to do the manual labour . <p> Now will we have to work hard to find ways to draw that latent talent out ? Sure , but we 're doing that anyway . So I 'm very optimistic that we 're going to get a much better outcome from a world that has more automation and I would go further and say that the new jobs that are going to be created are going to be much more interesting , they 're going to demand human skills that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative thinking about what our future will hold . <p> Glyn Davis A recent study said that just 0.5 per cent , half of one per cent of American workers are employed in the new industries , the industries that have emerged since 2000 , particularly around IT , so that 's what 's triggering the concern about a jobless future even for people who do expect to have lots of different careers and lots of training . Should we be concerned that we actually have to think about a world without employment , rather than a world in which employment is different ? <p> Pippa Malmgren I totally disagree with that number , and I 'll give you an example as to why it 's wrong . It assumes that a person employed in this new high-tech IT sector is pretty much the kid who went to Stanford or Berkley and has a PhD , but it does n't take account of a woman I wrote about in my book , Signals , called Jenny Doan , who is probably about 60 now and she runs a fantastic business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right - quilts , old-fashioned quilts like you throw over the bed . <p> She is so successful in this , she gets 400 visitors a day to the remote part of Missouri where she lives - she gets more hits on YouTube than most music bands , right - she 's got a massive following . What is she all about ; she 's all about using computer modelling to aid the process of cutting out the shapes , which is the hardest part of quilting , and nobody describes Jenny Doan as running a high-tech robotic automation company , but that is exactly what she 's doing . <p> There are millions of women around the world who are designing clothing patterns online and they 're selling them , you download them for a few dollars here and there , and it 's a small craft business - some of these women are only generating $500 a year , it 's a side business , it generates a little cash on the side . <p> Now nobody describes them as high tech , but that is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the fact is almost everything that we can deliver over the Internet , one way or the other , is connected to this process of using automation and artificial intelligence . So it 's not just Google , it 's not just Facebook , it 's not just Tesla and the things that the press write about - it 's actually pretty everything . <p> Glyn Davis Andrew do you worry about a jobless future ? <p> Andrew Charlton Not unless you have a very static definition of jobs . Now certainly many of the things we do today , we wo n't be doing in the future , but we 'll be doing lots of exciting new things in the future . I share Pippa 's optimism and her view of the long arc of history ; I think we are on the cusp of an enormous opportunity to make work much more rewarding , meaningful and enriching for humans , and we 're letting the type of work that is best done by machine , that dirty , dangerous and dull work , and we 're leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity , not necessarily to destroy work , but to make work more human . <p> Glyn Davis Automation may mean that rich countries do not have to rely on the labour provided by developing nations , the cheap goods made by low-wage workers ; do you think automation might deny poor countries the opportunity for economic development through the industrialisation that 's been the standard pathway today ? <p> Andrew Charlton I think it has two effects . Firstly , there is the possibility that automation , particularly in industries like manufacturing , mean that those industries are less labour-intensive , they require less workers , and as a consequence the motivation to place those factories in countries where labour is cheap declines , and we 're already seeing some of the repatriation of manufacturing from low-wage countries back to higher-wage countries as automation becomes a more important part of the manufacturing process . So that 's certainly true . <p> But the other part , the other channel of causation , is that all of these technologies are enabling information to flow more freely across countries and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffusion of technologies and , in many ways , helping the rate of catch-up in much of the developing world . <p> Glyn Davis So I 'd like to now just pursue the question of automation and the working class , because recently Nobel Laureate , Sir Angus Deaton , on this podcast , spoke to us about his research on the rising death rate of working class middle-aged Americans , and I 'd like to play just a short clip that he gave us on the changing nature of work . <p> Sir Angus Deaton Globalisation and technical change is making life very hard for people , you know you could think somebody with a high school degree , graduated in 1970 , went to work for General Motors or as someone said the other day , went to work for Generous Motors , they got a really pretty good salary , they got an increase every year , and they belonged to the unions . The union may not have been the most pleasant bunch of guys in the world , but they gave some real political power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security , yeah . <p> Angus Deaton And job security - and pay rises year after year . So these people could hope for a real middle-class life , and that has sort of gone . <p> Glyn Davis Pippa , one of President Trump 's central campaign promises was to bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to the US , but that does n't seem likely in the scenarios we 've discussed . <p> Pippa Malmgren Well , I would take issue with that ; what we do see is , as Andrew rightly points out , repatriation of manufacturing to the United States . So , for example , the company that makes all our iPhones , it 's called Foxconn , it 's the second largest employer in China , a Taiwanese company that employs 1.2 million Chinese people , and they 've just announced that they 're building a production facility in Wisconsin . Now when Wisconsin is a more attractive place to make iPhones than Shenzhen , something big is happening in the world economy . It is true that the number of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in Shenzhen . <p> So the question is : what do we do about new jobs , and my answer is we go back to the iPhone , where did it come from ? It came from Steve Jobs , a teenager in his garage - that is where innovation occurs . Everybody thinks you have to have big money and you have to have a big company , but the fact is most innovation is created by firms that employ less than 10 people and some kid in a garage or working off the kitchen table . <p> Now , by proviso to my optimism , is the one thing that we must do in order to ensure that we do n't end up with a completely unemployed working class , as Angus Deaton put it , is we have to equip everybody with the skill to innovate . Now specifically what I think we have to do is put , what an American would call , back in the school system . This is the class where you learn how to build an engine , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it 's broken , how to work with physical things , and this is not a small thing . <p> I mean we assume that people have to go to university and follow a track that takes them to a white-collared job and that that 's the only path to success and it 's the only path to Silicon Valley . That is not true . We can have a world where people are innovators and inventors themselves , but we have to equip them with the tools , and one of the biggest problems today is that the automation process makes it harder to access that . <p> So I think that the key thing is to stop thinking that a university degree is the only avenue to success and the only thing we treat with respect and instead let 's go back and put practical skills in people 's hands , because we 'll get many more Steve Jobs , they will create the next iPhone ... <p> Glyn Davis Andrew , can I seek an Australian perspective on this ; manufacturing in this country has shrunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 per cent , and particularly the car manufacturing industry has been very hard hit . Are we at risk of producing a generation who do n't have the skills or the education for the jobs they aspire to , and have n't had the advantage of what Pippa just called ? <p> Andrew Charlton The Australian labour market has been extremely dynamic over the last 25 years ; we have lost 100,000 machinery operated jobs in that time . We 've lost nearly 400,000 labourers , 250,000 jobs from the technicians and trades . There 's been an enormous loss of that type of blue-collar job , but there 's also been an explosion of other types of jobs ; we 've gained nearly half a million jobs in community and personal services over the same time . <p> So there is a lot of churn but new jobs being created , and the important thing for the education system is to say are we matching the skills that young people are requiring in education with the skills that they 're going to require in the future ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school today , they 're going to spend most of their career in the second half of the 21st Century ; has our system of education sufficiently changed to equip them with the skills they 're going to require ? I think it 's a question that we really have to grapple with . <p> Glyn Davis It 's fascinating , you 're right , to think about whether we could predict the skills required in the second half of the 21st Century ; I think it would be hubris to suggest we 'd know the content to teach , but we probably know something about the core skills required - they 're things like analysis , logic , problem solving , ability to master new fields quickly , and curiously they 're also the traditional attributes of a liberal education . <p> I 'd like to turn briefly to the field of robotics , if we may . Robots and computers of course are becoming increasingly shrewd ; Economists Eric Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have argued that computers are so dextrous now , that predicting their application 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a robotics company , can you tell us how close robots are to being able to replicate human behaviour , and are we all about to be replaced ? <p> Pippa Malmgren Laughs I do n't see them replicating human behaviour or replacing human beings during my lifetime . It 's interesting as a manufacturer of commercial drones - so aerial robots , I find the gap between what people think they can do and what they can actually do is just a mile-wide . <p> They are able to do things that we have n't been able to do before ; they can give us an aerial view that helps , for example , in the mining industry - we solve many , many problems in the mining industry by having an aerial view . How much fluid is in the run-off dam , which is usually toxic and highly controlled by governments - it 's important to know what 's the volume and what 's the shape of the basin underneath . We can do this using an overhead drone . <p> We can tell you what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; literally we look at the pile of dirt you 've pulled out of the mine , and we can you what 's the value of the mine , depending on what you 're mining . Now all that 's great , but what it ca n't do is solve the problem just because it exists . It 's a human that 's using it that is able to take the tool to find a solution . <p> Another thing is people think that drones and aerial robots , that they have independent intelligence and you often will see them flying in swarms when you look at YouTube videos . But what you do n't notice is that it 's inside four walls where you have an incredible amount of computing power - this does n't happen out in the natural environment . So the gap again between what you can do in certain environments and others , is just huge . <p> I just think it 's important to remember that our imagination and what 's actually happening are two very different things , so we may over-estimate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function . Again I 'd come back to the great writers on the subject , who are like yeah , what they ca n't do is invent . They ca n't innovate - they ca n't judge a landscape that is n't linear . It 's a mathematical tool basically . Whatever you program into it , it will just do it , but you change the environment and that thing will literally hit the wall , and then it 's no good to you laughs . <p> Glyn Davis Andrew , robotics in Australia - are these an emerging and important part of our economy ? <p> Andrew Charlton Slower than other countries ; Australian firms are embracing some of these technologies , but certainly at a slower rate . Nine per cent of Australia 's largest companies are engaging in automation and that 's about half the rate of some of the global peers , including the United States . <p> The mining industry in Australia is one of the industries that is at the forefront , but there are certainly many other industries which are lagging behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this is an important question . These technologies are , first and foremost , are positive productivity shock and they will , amongst other things , determine the competitiveness of Australia 's industries into the future . <p> So this is a debate that has been substantially shrouded in a narrative of job loss and fear and concern , but we need to get some balance into that debate to think about the opportunities in these technologies as well as the risks . That is not to minimise the transitional challenge . That is not at all to say that it 's not very difficult for the workers displaced by these technologies . Australia and most other countries do not have a very good record of transitioning workers affected by economic disruption . Over the last quarter Century , I think one in 10 unskilled men who lost their jobs never returned to the labour force , and today nearly one in four unskilled men do n't participate in the labour force . <p> So these big economic shocks are not costless for everyone , and Pippa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that 's right , but we need to remember that for individuals affected , there are significant challenges , and those challenges need to managed and supported . <p> Pippa Malmgren I totally agree with that and I think , so more than anything , it 's not an education change that 's required , as much as an attitude change . This idea that we 're going to have to constantly change our skillset , adopt new technologies and embrace them . <p> One piece of this , I just wanted to emphasise , was we often think in terms of humans versus robots , but it is n't going to be humans versus robots because humans are becoming more robotic every single day . As we age , we 're going to find they replace our hip , or they replace our knee - not just with a spare but with a robotic , automated spare part , one that , by the way , will be identical to your own bone tissue because it will have been 3D printed based on your own bone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking robotics in order to do internal surgeries . There was a fascinating robot developed the other day which you ingest , you swallow it and it can actually conduct surgeries on you from the inside . It can stay in you to monitor if events occur that require an emergency surgery , as you 're walking down the street . I love the saying by Mark Twain that the eyes ca n't see clearly if the imagination is out of focus , and I think that 's exactly what we 're going to have to do . <p> So Elon Musk has got this new company where he will be implanting electrodes directly into human brains , terrifying as that sounds , and what it will do is permit us to be able to interface directly with the Internet without needing a phone or a screen or any kind of physical mechanism . That is an entirely different world than the one we live in today . So I challenge people to draw the line between what is robotic and what is human , as humans become far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and similarly we will be injecting robots with more and more human qualities . <p> Now , I do n't think that they will be qualities that permit them to think differently than humans - they 'll think the way we program them to , but this does raise interesting questions about where is the line ? I mean I hate to go into this space , but they 're developing sex toys that are basically humanoid , and one of the big moral debates that 's broken out is some of the Japanese-made sex toys have a - you know they 're programmed , you can have Program 1 , Program 2 . <p> One of the programs is a rape function that a woman could program a male robot to rape her . Then what happens if you end up in a room with this thing by accident ? We have so many moral issues and so many societal issues that arise from this merging between what is robotic and what is human . <p> Glyn Davis You mentioned Elon Musk and I 'd like to pursue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automation and argued the case for a universal basic income as a necessary response . Pippa , as an economist , what do you think of the universal basic income idea as a policy response to potential wide-spread unemployment ? <p> Pippa Malmgren Well first of all , I do n't think we 're going to have potential widespread unemployment , and brilliant as Elon Musk is , I also think he is not appreciating the new jobs , and new functions , that will come to life as automation advances . <p> But also I think it 's not really a matter of providing a universal basic income , it is how to get government to provide services more efficiently than it does today . I mean we live in a world today where governments are mainly deeply indebted , if not entirely broke , and telling their citizens I 'm really sorry but I know I promised you could retire at 55 or 65 , but now I ca n't afford that anymore , and your pension fund is underfunded , so the new retirement age in practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there 's a problem here . <p> So could automation help governments get their act together so they are in better financial shape , and therefore can deliver more services to their citizens , which would eliminate the need for a universal basic income , that would provide more - and frankly you know that needs to happen with automation or without it , but I think that automation is part of the solution . <p> I mean the way governments operate today , they literally run the business of government using pieces of paper - it 's insane what the cost is to government of administering the tax system of the economy . <p> That could all be automated , but again everything I 'm saying is premised on the idea that a human being has to change ; they 're going to have to be willing to say I used to be an auditor and now I write poetry , which there 's a demand for because I sell it on the Internet and people pay me money for it . You 're going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old one . <p> Glyn Davis So Andrew , your report says that Australia needs a bold and proactive policy approach to automation ; what do you have in mind ? <p> Andrew Charlton Well , two things . First of all , we need to shift mindset away from seeing these technologies as primarily threats to jobs , and seeing them as opportunities - opportunities to improve the type of work that we do , to improve the competitiveness of our industries , to create new jobs that are more meaningful , more valuable , more stimulating than the jobs we have today . <p> Secondly , we need to recognise that there are transitional challenges and we need to prepare the workforce , the current workforce and the future workforce , to adapt and thrive and seize those opportunities . If we do both of those things then automation and artificial intelligence are a huge opportunity for Australia , and one that we really have to seize . <p> Glyn Davis Pippa , if I may ask , you 're a former advisor to the President of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work would you offer the current President ? <p> Pippa Malmgren Well to be honest , I think people put more credit in the Oval Office being able to fix things than it deserves , regardless of who the President is . I would say this , what we 've got to do is number one , get that shop-class back into the schools , back into kids ' hands so that we can get a generation that is comfortable with the idea of innovating . <p> Two , when people ask the question , of any age , what am I going to do when I grow up - which by the way my dad , who is 80 , he asked me this question too right , because actually his opportunities to do new interesting things are so much greater today because of the Internet , because of automation and AI . The answer to the question is many , many things ; no-one should ever say to anyone you have to pick a job or even pick a career . What you have to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life and I think this is an incredible gift , but it 's an attitude change . <p> Third , I think that government can reform the school systems in such a way that we stop focussing on memorisation and passing tests , and instead we focus on how to create , how to adapt , how to become faster at changing ourselves , how to learn new stuff quicker because now we 've got life-time education . Like I said , if you 're a 50 year old today , chances are you 're going to live another 50 years , and the idea that you 're just going to sit there doing the same thing you 're doing today , is just - well frankly it 's going to be very boring for you . <p> I would get with the program , learn about technology and enter this entirely new world , where you can reach out to the entire of humanity and deliver . So I think these are the things that need to change - not all of them are government driven , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change our attitude and we 'll get a better outcome . <p> Estimates show that around 45 per cent of workers currently perform tasks that could be automated in the near future . As the trend gathers pace , more than half of all existing jobs will be automated within 20 years . <p> For Australia , this means up to 5 million jobs lost . <p> To discuss what the future of work might look like , former economic advisor to President Bush and President Obama and co-founder of , Dr Pippa Malmgren , and former advisor to the Prime Minister and director of AlphaBeta consultancy , Dr Andrew Charlton join the host , Professor Glyn Davis , Vice-Chancellor University 's Privacy Officer at **30;804;TOOLONG 
 <h> Coming to grips with a ' silent killer ' <p> This is Up Close , the research talk show from the University of Melbourne Australia . <p> Music <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> I 'm Andi Horvath . Thanks for joining us . <p> Cancer of the liver is becoming the fastest-growing cancer type in many parts of the world , overtaking even lung cancer . Why ? The hepatitis type B and C viruses and their link to liver cancer . To give you a sense of scale , hepatitis , which simply means inflammation of the liver , was responsible for 1.34 million cancer or cirrhosis deaths in 2015 alone . **27;1084;TOOLONG million people live with chronic hep B infection and another 71 million live with hep C. In fact , while the number of people with tuberculosis and HIV are falling , the numbers of those with hepatitis are going up . <p> There has been a growing awareness and a move to concerted action to taken on what has become in some parts of the world an epidemic . The World Health Assembly , which governs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viral hepatitis as a health threat by 2030 . So how is that meant to happen and what are its chances of success ? <p> Our guest on Up Close is physician and epidemiologist Professor Ben Cowie , who has been involved in public health policy around viral hepatitis in Australia and internationally . He works in communicable disease epidemiology and surveillance at the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services in Australia . Since 2015 Ben has been inaugural director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Viral Hepatitis , headquartered at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity . <p> Ben , welcome . <p> BEN COWIE <p> Thank you very much , and well done with that introduction , I must say laughs . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> There are five different strains of hepatitis , the A , B , C , D and E , and as my producer put it , an alphabet soup of virus strains . <p> BEN COWIE <p> Indeed . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Now , how do people with hepatitis typically present at the doctor 's office ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEN COWIE <p> Yeah . That 's part of the trap of hepatitis , that is that there are a particular set of symptoms and signs that might lead someone to present to a doctor , particularly if they 've got acute or newly-acquired hepatitis . It 's very hard to distinguish based on those symptoms and signs which type of hepatitis someone may have . The things we think about are fever , abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting , and particularly jaundice , which is the signs in the skin and in the eyes of an elevated level of a protein that 's produced in the liver called bilirubin . <p> The trap that I referred to however is that the vast majority of people living with chronic or long-term hepatitis B and hepatitis C have no specific symptoms or signs whatsoever . This is why it 's been referred to as a silent disease that can be actually causing substantial illness and damage to the liver with no symptoms or signs to lead someone to present to their doctor . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Right . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it as easy as a blood test ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> It is as easy as a blood test . So for hepatitis B and C , which are the chronic or long-term forms of hepatitis , it is as simple as having a blood test which any GP , general practitioner I mean or a family medicine doctor , can order , and it 's a simple blood test . In fact , overseas outside of Australia there are also rapid diagnostic tests that can be used to detect hepatitis B or hepatitis C. They 're not available here as yet outside research settings . But if someone goes to their doctor and expresses the desire to have a hepatitis test - we can talk about what might lead someone to do that in a moment - it is a simple blood test to tell you whether you 've got the infection or , indeed , for the hepatitis B whether you 're immune . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> So what 's going on in the body 's liver cells with hep B and C ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> BEN COWIE <p> It 's a good analogy in that it 's a chronic infection that has a particular cellular target for that infection where it causes the problems . You 've pointed out HIV ; that infects the lymphocytes particularly , that strain of lymphocytes , the T-helper cells , and therefore causes immune problems by knocking out those cells . Hepatitis is different from HIV in that the primary target of these infections is the liver , which is where we get the term hepatitis from , it 's Latin for inflammation of the liver . <p> In both hepatitis B and hepatitis C it 's the infection of those liver cells that results in the long-term illnesses , cirrhosis which is severe scarring of the liver and can lead to liver failure , and also liver cancer . An important part of how this happens is the immune system 's action against the affected liver cells . So a lot of the damage that 's occurring , a lot of that scarring and inflammation is caused by the immune system seeking to eradicate the virus from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us have heard of hep B and C as the longer-term , even lifetime infections . <p> BEN COWIE <p> Yes . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Now , they 're the most serious ones , are n't they ? So let 's talk about hep B. How many people does it affect and how does it affect them ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> On a global basis it 's estimated that around 250 million human beings are living with chronic hepatitis B , so this is an incredibly prevalent condition . That distribution across the world is quite uneven . Some areas more than 10 percent of the population will be living with chronic hepatitis B whereas in other parts of the world less than one percent of the population have hepatitis B , so it 's quite diverse . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> This is a bloodborne disease , so how is it transmitted ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> Yeah . The majority of people living with chronic or long-term hepatitis B acquired it at birth from transmission from their mother or in early life , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construed or described as a bloodborne virus . Most people will think about unsafe injections , about sexually-transmitted infections . Whilst they 're important sources of transmission , the vast majority of people living with chronic or long-term hep B acquired it very early in life . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Now , hep B has a vaccine and an antiviral treatment , does n't it ? But we 'll come back to that . <p> BEN COWIE <p> Okay . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Now , let 's also talk about hep C , which is the other well-known one . <p> BEN COWIE <p> Hepatitis C , the prevalence on a global basis is around 70 million people living with hepatitis C , so again a very , very common viral infection . Hepatitis C is similar to hep B in that these chronic infections are responsible for the vast majority of the burden of adverse outcomes , including cirrhosis or scarring of the liver and liver cancer . However , unlike hepatitis B it 's uncommonly spread from mother to child at the time of birth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blood . So needles , whether that 's in health care settings or through injecting drug use . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Okay . Now , there 's no vaccine for hep C is there , but there is some ... <p> BEN COWIE <p> No . A lot of work going on in that space but nothing available as yet . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Right . What about antivirals to help treat it , has that been developed ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> They certainly have , and in fact a whole new array of antivirals have become available in recent years which make hepatitis C an eminently curable condition . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> All right . Now let 's talk about the rest of the soup . There 's also hepatitis D ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> Yes . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Where does that happen ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> Hepatitis D , I guess on a biological basis is quite interesting in that it can only infect someone who 's already living with hepatitis B. It ca n't actually establish infection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we term it a satellite virus . In some areas where there 's lots of hep B , there 's also lots of hepatitis D , but in other areas very , very little . It 's quite diverse , even within those populations where hepatitis B is prevalent . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Okay . Now , when I travel I get an injection for hepatitis . Which hepatitis am I getting an injection for ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> Most likely that 's hepatitis A. Now , hepatitis A is spread through contaminated food and water , and that 's the one we commonly associate with a travel-related infection , but on a global basis clearly hepatitis A affects a very significant proportion of the human population . Different from B and C , however , there is no chronic or long-term infection , and once you 've had hepatitis A you 're immune for the rest of your life . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Right . Now , there 's one more left , hep E. What 's that one ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread through contaminated food and water . It tends to be more so an infection of adults rather than for children . In many endemic areas , although this is changing under the influence of increased access to safe water and sanitation , and in some regards , vaccination , hep A was always a condition in endemic areas that mainly infected children , and by the time someone was 10 years old the vast majority of those children had been exposed , often asymptomatically in childhood , and were immune . <p> Hep E , there have been some very notable large outbreaks of hepatitis E in history and they 've often been associated with contamination of water sources on a large scale . One of the other notable things about hep E is that although in most cases it 's a relatively self-limiting infection , it does n't cause any serious illness for the majority of people , if someone is affected during pregnancy , particularly a woman infected during the third trimester of pregnancy , it can be very serious both for the woman and for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health issue with hepatitis E. <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Right . Is there a vaccine for that one ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> A vaccine has been developed but it 's only licensed in China and so it 's only routinely available in China . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> I 'm Andi Horvath . In this episode of Up Close we 're joined by infectious diseases expert Professor Ben Cowie , and we 're talking about the impact of viral hepatitis and plans to eliminate it as a public health risk . <p> Ben , what 's it like to live with chronic or lifetime hepatitis ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> I obviously ca n't speak on behalf of people living with chronic viral hepatitis but there 's obviously the medical and the health side but perhaps even more prominently is the stigma and discrimination that can be associated for living with a chronic viral infection such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C. <p> Some of those stories of stigma also included in health care settings , which is clearly utterly unacceptable but still occurs today in terms of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at medical or dental clinics having a member of staff such as a receptionist calling out to someone across the way saying oh , be careful of this one , they 've got hep C in front of other patients which is clearly not only unethical and immoral but illegal . <p> So from that right through to intrafamilial discrimination . What I mean by that is that someone who 's been given a diagnosis of hepatitis B either of their own accord or by their family members being ostracised from things such as family meals , from even living in the same house . Now , that 's devastating . Hepatitis B in particular has been described as family business because it does tend to pass from mother to child , it tends to be within the family and also causes illness within the family . <p> Often when I talk to patients living with hepatitis B , they 'll talk about parents or aunts , uncles , grandparents who have died of liver cancer , almost certainly from hep B , and the idea that that family unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , women who are diagnosed antenatally , so while they 're pregnant , often have incredible and understandable degree of concern about okay , what does this mean for my baby , what does this mean for my relationship . So it 's quite fraught and I think we are not doing patients or people living with viral hepatitis any favours if we purely view this from a technical or virological perspective ; it 's a whole-person issue . <p> There 's a very wide spectrum in how primary care family medicine doctors approach viral hepatitis . There are some clear champions , to the point where in the state where we 're currently , Victoria in Australia , there are GPs who are setting up standalone hepatitis B or hepatitis C clinics within their practices to try and serve the needs of their patients affected by viral hepatitis . There 's a whole range of general practitioners , family medicine doctors who do a great job in terms of screening their patients at risk and linking them to care . <p> There are unfortunately stories on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left them with no information , no linkage to ongoing care and often a sense of futility about the diagnosis that there 's nothing we can do about it , which for both hep B and hep C is completely inaccurate today . <p> The other concerning issue is when , particularly for something like hepatitis B where someone is likely to have been living with it since the time they were born , if it 's a person from a high prevalence area , say 10 percent chance of having chronic hepatitis B , they 've been seeing the same doctor for 10 , 15 , 20 years and no one 's done the test and then the test is only done when someone presents with liver cancer , that 's a gross failure of the health care system in delivering services to that person . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Let 's turn our attention globally . Are there patterns where there are large clusters of people with hepatitis around the globe ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> There are , and that 's particularly the case for hepatitis b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas where more than 10 percent of the adult population are living with chronic hepatitis B and our own region , the Western Pacific region of the World Health Organisation , has the world 's greatest burden of hepatitis B and in many of those populations , such as in East and Southeast Asia , prior to the vaccination becoming available , roughly 10 percent of the population were living with chronic hepatitis B. It 's also in the Pacific Islands , parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South America . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> So these various hot spots or zones on the planet that have hepatitis , what do these places have in common that make them vulnerable ? Are there patterns that are similar ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> There are , and that 's different for hepatitis B and hepatitis C. The greatest diversity in prevalence occurs for hepatitis B , and some people assume that that 's got to do with access to vaccination , for instance , or to other aspects of the health care system and in fact it 's got nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disparity but the reason why someone born in East Asia prior to vaccination had a 10 percent chance of having hepatitis B and someone born in Northern Europe had a less than one percent chance of having hepatitis B , all comes down to the genotype or strain of hepatitis B that is prevalent in that population . <p> Let me explain . There is a range of different genotypes of hepatitis B which have basically differentiated in the human population as we 've migrated around the world . There 's good evidence to suggest that hepatitis B actually migrated out of Africa with human beings and as we 've differentiated and diversified around the world over those tens of thousands of years , so too has hepatitis B. In the areas where there 's a high prevalence of hepatitis B , of the order of 10 percent of the adult population , the reason for that is that those particular genotypes are associated with there being a high viral load , so a high viral count in the blood of individuals through to their twenties and thirties . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving birth are much more likely to have a lot of hepatitis B virus around when they deliver their baby and therefore for that baby to be infected . This sets up a feedback loop where in a high prevalence setting you 're more likely to be infected at birth , have chronic long-term infection as a consequence , and then for women , you 're then more likely when you 're giving birth to pass on the infection to your children . <p> In contrast , in low prevalence areas where the genotypes do n't have a high viral load during that peak childbearing years , you have no such feedback loop and so therefore the prevalence does n't amplify . This is why in some areas you have 10 percent of the population and in some areas less than one percent . It 's got very , very little to do with things like health system access or relative resources in the community . What vaccination is doing is wiping out that inequity in hepatitis B prevalence on a global basis and why we need to invest more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a global basis . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Now , you and your colleagues have been doing some work on hepatitis in Mongolia . Tell us about the situation there and your activities there . <p> BEN COWIE <p> We were fortunate enough to be invited by the Mongolian government in partnership with the World Health Organisation Western Pacific regional office and colleagues from both the Korean and the United States Centres for Disease control to go to a workshop and to run a workshop in Ulaanbaatar around viral hepatitis , specifically around laboratory capacity , so testing , access to testing and the surveillance systems , so how does the results of those tests get up to the government level to be able to plan around things such as health care access , treatment and cure . <p> Now , those workshops . The reason the first of those was in Mongolia was twofold . Firstly , the burden of viral hepatitis is very significant . Liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Mongolia and the prevalence or the proportion of the adult population living with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a huge health issue for Mongolia . <p> The second reason was that the government is really trying to do something about it , and so the Mongolian Government has been investing their resources in what 's called a healthy liver program where they 're seeking to screen a significant proportion of the population in an attempt to get a handle on the viral hepatitis epidemic . In partnership with very significant uptake of vaccination for infants , the prevalence amongst young children now in Mongolia is less than one percent as a testament to that effort . They 're trying to scale up treatment and care for both hepatitis B and hepatitis C in partnership with clinicians and private foundations in the country . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Can vaccination actually take it down to zero ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> It is doing that . Let me give an example of China . Over the last 20 years or so China has scaled up their domestic vaccination program hugely , and between 1992 and 2006 when there were two large serosurveys or surveys of testing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proportion of those children living with hepatitis B fell from around 10 percent in ' 92 to less than one percent in 2006 . <p> The infant vaccination program in China alone , which incorporates birth dose of vaccination , so within 24 hours of birth getting a dose of hep B vaccine into the baby and then followed up with routine immunisation through the course of infancy , that has prevented in excess of 20 million chronic hep B infections just in the last 15 years and will have saved millions of future lives that would otherwise have been lost to liver cancer or cirrhosis . The scale-up of hepatitis B vaccine in our region , the Western Pacific region , is ahead of all other regions in the world and will rightly be viewed as one of the great public health achievements of the 21st century . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> I want to go to the Australian setting . Tell us about the situation there . <p> BEN COWIE <p> Here in Australia , around two-thirds of people living with hepatitis B were either born overseas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalent , or are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people . Just by asking those two questions , or considering those two factors , you capture about two-thirds of the risk of having hepatitis B. We 've got guidelines in place for many years suggesting that everyone born overseas in those areas and all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be offered testing for hepatitis B along with some other priority populations such as people who inject drugs or who have a history of injecting drugs , men who have sex with men and others . <p> For hepatitis C it 's different and here in Australia the majority of people , around 80 percent or so , acquired it through injecting drug use , unsafe injecting drugs , sharing needles or kit etcetera . From a hep B perspective we estimate that a third of Australians living with chronic hepatitis B still do n't know they 've got it , have n't been diagnosed , and when we look at the hepatitis B cascade of care , which is a way we look at how is the health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chronic viral infection . These are well established for HIV , they 're starting to be used for hep B and hep C as well . But when we look at that for the Australian setting , only 15 percent of the roughly 240,000 Australians living with hep B are actually receiving ongoing monitoring or care . That means 85 percent of Australians living with hep B are not receiving guideline-based care , and in a rich country with a well-functioning universal health care system , that 's an unacceptable finding . <p> When we get to the pointy end , the proportion actually on treatment , we believe that around six-and-a-half percent of Australians living with hep B are currently receiving antiviral treatment , and we estimate that at least 15 percent need to be to prevent progression to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer . The combined impact of undertreatment of hep B and hep C , along with some other conditions , is why liver cancer is the fastest-increasing cause of cancer death in this country and is now number six in terms of causes of cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , similar results are the case when we look at other countries . We certainly know that similar lack of access to diagnosis is occurring in the United States , for instance , and the same cascade of care is a real problem there . There 's been recent evidence coming out that for even people living with severe scarring of the liver who are insured , the proportion who are having surveillance for liver cancer is unacceptably low . So Australia unfortunately is not unique on either a global basis or even amongst high-income countries in terms of the lack of appropriate responses to hepatitis B. <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Okay , lessons from the hep C approaches so far ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> There 's fortunately a much happier story in hepatitis C that we can relate . I think one of the real strengths in Australia is early adoption of a harm reduction approach , trying to ensure access to needle and syringe exchanges etcetera has been one of the reasons why our hepatitis C prevalence is not as great as it is in some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , on 1 March of 2016 the Australian Government funded the inclusion of a range of these new hep C drugs , the direct-acting antivirals , for universal access . Some of the critical points to this were that firstly , there were no restrictions on the basis of how much scarring , so it was n't just for people with cirrhosis . There were minimal restrictions and those have since been further loosened around which types of doctor could prescribe these drugs . In many countries it 's only infectious diseases specialists such as myself , or gastroenterologists , hepatologists who are allowed to prescribe these drugs . <p> In Australia , any medical practitioner is allowed to prescribe these drugs , and with the capacity to call up for some assistance should they need it from a specialist , we have seen the number of prescriptions written by doctors , more than half of those are now written by general practitioners , family medicine doctors in primary care . This is probably the one message that you 've got to make it low cost , or zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make accessible where they live , not just in tertiary centres that have a one-year waiting list . And thirdly , every doctor needs to be able to prescribe these drugs . <p> What we 've seen in Australia as a result is that approximately 15 percent of the people living with hepatitis C as of 1 March of 2016 have been issued these drugs now . It 's a huge upswing ; more people treated than have in the history of hep C treatment prior to that . As a consequence , there are less people living with hepatitis C in this country every day . That 's a fantastic outcome , with clear messages for other countries . You can negotiate to access these drugs much more cheaply than what some countries are paying currently , you need to have it accessible to all people living with hepatitis C and able to be prescribed by any doctor or ideally , any health care worker . That 's the way to get rid of hepatitis C. <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Is public awareness part of that picture ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr G. Yunupingu , and he was only aged 46 , due to kidney failure . Now , hepatitis was implicated in that . Do these sorts of awareness stories help in bringing people to the clinics ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> I think there 's no question about that . <p> One of the concerns about hepatitis , both here in Australia but also on a global basis is that there has not been the same degree of partnership with affected communities as has characterised the HIV response . There has been nowhere near the same sort of investment globally in awareness raising and engagement with populations generally . A lot of people when you talk to them about hepatitis , as you mentioned at the start of this podcast , have no idea what we 're really talking about or the different strains or what 's going on with it . So absolutely yes , that applies not only to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here in Australia , although it 's a big issue , and there is work being done in the Northern Territory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Top End of the Northern Territory . <p> There 's been work done on developing app-based communications in local languages and engaging with local communities , particularly through the use of trained Aboriginal health workers who are extremely qualified in taking health messages to their communities and supporting their communities to access health care , right through to recent Australian government initiatives to fund community organisations to develop messages in a range of community settings with an objective of linking those people into care . <p> Similar stuff is happening overseas , similar programs . I know that in China , as we mentioned previously , there 's been a lot of work done reducing stigma and discrimination around hepatitis B in a condition which has previously seen people lose their jobs and people take their lives because of the stigma and discrimination associated with a diagnosis of hep B. That is just unacceptable in the current day . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> In some ways you 've answered my next question , which was how does that she 'd light on some of the challenges in hepatitis health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> I think one of the really major challenges is that on a global basis , the vast majority of people living with chronic viral hepatitis have not been tested and they 've got no idea . At least 80 percent of people living with hep C and more than 90 percent living with hepatitis B in the world today have never been tested and do n't know they 've got it . Now , that 's a big problem for them in terms of their ability to access health care and to make decisions around their own health , but it also means such things as vaccination of household or sexual partners or household contacts ca n't occur and so it facilitates ongoing transmission . That is clearly something that is in the WHO global health sector strategy for viral hepatitis with elimination objective , as you 've mentioned , by 2030 . People ca n't get access to treatment if they do n't know they 've got the condition in the first place , so a critical point of access is access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can we really eliminate a virus that causes hepatitis ? Wo n't new strains just evolve and emerge like other viruses ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> That 's a really excellent question and that 's enough for a series of podcasts in itself . I think partly it 's important to be clear about the terminology we 're using here . Elimination as a public health concern is distinct from eradication . Eradication is where there are no more cases of a condition . We have so far eradicated two viruses , one was smallpox which has been eradicated from the human population , and the other one is actually an animal virus called Rinderpest which has been eliminated from animal populations . They 're the only two . We 're tantalisingly close to doing it for polio as well , have been for some time . There 's been a huge amount of energy and resources poured into that effort by the World Health Organisation and partner organisations and member states so hopefully we 're able to talk about that in the past tense in coming years as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elimination as a public health concern , is essentially to say that what we want to see is that viral hepatitis is a manageable concern by 2030 and that is something that has had a substantial reduction in I guess the human health impact of those conditions . To get there , the definitions in the Global Health Sector Strategy is a 90 percent reduction from the 2015 baseline in new cases of hepatitis B and hepatitis C and a 65 percent reduction in the number of people dying attributable to those conditions , so that 's clearly a waypoint . What we all want to see is these things gone from the human population , and that is feasible , but in the timeframe of this strategy a very aspirational but achievable waypoint is to eliminate it as an emerging , urgent public health concern , and that 's what the WHO is aiming for . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Now , there are still some scientific challenges though , are n't there ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> That 's for sure . We need a hepatitis B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C vaccine . We need potentially hepatitis B vaccines which do n't require the same number of doses to achieve the same effect or there 's some evidence that some strains of hep B are less well covered by the vaccine . It 's still very effective but it is possible that refinements to the hepatitis B vaccine could improve its control of hepatitis B amongst infants . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> What about coinfections with HIV ? Does this complicate things in the management of hepatitis ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> It does , but less than it used to . For both hepatitis B and hepatitis C there are some complicating factors . I think one of the things that makes it relatively easier in hepatitis B is some of the very drugs we used to treat HIV are very effective against hepatitis B. If someone is put on a regimen for their HIV management that includes a couple of drugs such as tenofovir or emtricitabine , they 're very effective treatments against hepatitis B also . So you can simultaneously treat someone with no additional pill burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until recently by the fact that the predominant treatment we had available for hepatitis C was a drug called interferon . Now , interferon was a drug that stimulated the immune system to eradicate the virus . You can understand that someone living with advanced HIV-AIDS particularly , stimulating the immune system using a drug like interferon is not going to have the same sort of ability to eradicate the virus because the immune system is so impaired to start with . <p> Furthermore , in someone with advanced liver disease , certainly cirrhosis or severe scarring , there was the danger that by stimulating the immune system to eradicate the virus you could actually tip someone 's liver over into liver failure , so it was a real danger . The new drugs we have available , the direct-acting antivirals , or DAAs , for hepatitis C act in a completely different manner by working on a variety of targets within the virus itself , and as a consequence have simplified very substantially our ability to cure hepatitis C in people who are also living with HIV . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimising harm attributed to drug use ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> There is , and there 's very , very good evidence that appropriately funded harm reduction programs , including access to needle and syringe exchanges , to opiate replacement therapy , and importantly , to peer-led models to encourage the safe use of injected drugs and to minimise harm , including bloodborne virus transmission such as hepatitis B and C and HIV , they 're very cost effective ways of protecting the health of people who inject and doing so in a way that respects their human rights . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> So then the bigger social and political challenges in tackling hepatitis , what are they ? <p> BEN COWIE <p> In a way I think viral hepatitis , hepatitis B in particular has been a failure of the fact that we 've had a vaccine for so long and the assumption was the vaccine 's going to take care of it , we do n't have to worry about hepatitis B , it 's something that we 're sorting out with vaccination . While scaling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 250 million people already living with chronic hepatitis B. The same applies to hepatitis C. <p> I think there 's been a real neglect relative to its importance for human health and that 's something that the root causes of which can be tied to the affected communities not having a voice in many countries . So people inject drugs , we 've talked about criminalisation as being a fundamental reason why people who inject drugs do n't have access to political process in the same way that other groups living for instance with HIV , which has also been stigmatised and in many countries such as Australia , being predominantly amongst men who have sex with men , that again in many countries is a very stigmatised situation as well . So I do n't think the battle is by any means over for HIV . I 'm not trying to say that , but we have definitely lagged behind HIV in that building of a consensus between affected communities , public health authorities and clinicians around what needs to happen , and as a consequence there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We have a Global Fund for HIV , TB and malaria . In the Western Pacific region of the World Health Organisation , hepatitis B alone results in more people losing their lives every year than HIV , TB and malaria combined , but we do n't have a Global Fund for hepatitis or even for hepatitis B. Those funding mechanisms , and I should say investment , really , mechanisms , investment in people 's health , have excluded viral hepatitis for too long and that 's something that really needs to change if we 're going to be serious about addressing viral hepatitis as a public health concern . <p> ANDI HORVATH <p> Ben , I look forward to the day of interviewing you about how we overcame and eliminated hepatitis by 2030 .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Life 's a drag , unless you live in a bubble <p> In a breakthrough in our understanding of hydrodynamics , researchers have demonstrated the seemingly impossible : a ball that sinks in water with almost zero drag <p> By Dr Daryl Holland , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Water will easily stop a bullet , but it ca n't stop a ball sinking in a bubble . <p> This is the remarkable result from a series of experiments that have for the first time shown objects sinking in water with close to zero drag , finally proving an 18th century theory in physics . <p> Swimmers experience it , fish have evolved their sleek shapes to minimise it , ships are slowed by it , and submarines use copious amounts of energy to defeat it . Drag slows everything down in water , and removing it is the holy grail of fluid mechanics . <p> Improvements of just 5 or 10 per cent drag reduction can have a major impact on fuel efficiency and speed , but what if you reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers from the University of Melbourne , Kind Abdullah University of Science and Technology Saudi Arabia , and the Institute of High Performance Computing in Singapore have cracked it . Their findings are published in the journal Science Advances . <p> The shape of fish , like sharks , have evolved to minimise the impact of drag as they move through water . Picture : BRJ <p> The experiment looks simple . Drop a metal ball into a deep pool . The ball forms a large gas bubble in the shape of an elongated teardrop around itself and then the sink together . Do the maths and it turns out that this ball experiences ten times less drag than a solid object with the same shape . <p> It looks simple , but it is n't . This experiment requires a very particular set of conditions , and the team has spent years understanding its theoretical basis . <p> It starts with the ball , or to be specific , two balls . <p> " There are two ways we can create these gas layers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Melbourne , and one of the study leaders . <p> " The first is to heat a metal sphere to a very high temperature , and the second is to use a superhydrophobic surface . <p> " For the first , we heat the ball to 400 degrees Celsius , and we heat the water to 95 degrees Celsius -- just below its boiling point . <p> " When the ball hits the water it boils a small amount of water immediately around it , creating a layer of water vapour . At the right combination of ball and water temperatures this layer becomes stable , so the ball is completely encased in the gas . We call this a Leidenfrost state . " <p> This is the ' inside out ' version of the phenomenon most cooks would regularly see when they add small amounts of water to a very hot pan , and the water droplets skitter across the pan , because they are elevated by a vapor film sustained by the hot surface . <p> The second kind of ball works by repelling the water around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think of water beading and running off a Goretex jacket . And when something is superhydrophobic , that hatred runs deep . <p> The ball is coated in a product called Glaco Mirror Coat Zero , it 's actually sold as a spray-on water repellent coating for side mirrors on cars . It is so effective at repelling water that under the right conditions the ball maintains a layer of gas between itself and the water even when completely submerged . <p> " The benefit of the superhydrophobic coating is that it works in water at room temperature , " says Professor Chan . <p> Dr Ivan and Professor Sigurdur Thoroddsen , who lead the King Abdullah University part of the team , say there are a lot of ways to reduce drag . <p> " Dimples on golf balls is one example , as is the pattern on a shark 's skin , " says Dr . <p> " Releasing air bubbles in front of an object moving in water can significantly reduce drag , as can using a hydrophobic surface . " <p> Professor Thoroddsen says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the fluid -- such as water or air -- flows around the object , particularly right next to the object , at what is called the boundary layer . <p> " In our previous experiments , we got stable gas layers around these balls , but they were less than 1 millimetre thick , " he says . <p> " This helped to reduce the drag by 10 or 20 percent , but this was n't enough , so we started to think of ways to create a bigger bubble around these balls . " <p> They started dropping the balls from various heights , and found that at just the right range of heights , a large gas cavity was created around the ball , and this shape was maintained as the ball sank through the water . <p> Dr Evert of the Institute of High Performance Computing and Professor Chan who did the theoretical analysis and modelling are excited by how this discovery has taken a purely theoretical concept and made it real . <p> " There 's a well-known theory in this field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surface , will fall to zero , " says Dr . <p> " This is the well-known d'Alembert 's Paradox and our result is a 21st century realisation of an 18th century theoretical result . <p> " In the study of fluid dynamics , we 've always used a hypothetical sphere because we have n't been able to create an object with a surface -- until now . <p> " The motion of balls , like the aforementioned golf ball , is impossible to predict with a mathematical formula because of the chaotic action of turbulence , but the has no turbulence and can be described by very simple equations . It could become a textbook example of some fundamental hydrodynamic theories . " <p> This research has important implications for the development of energy-efficient marine vehicles . <p> " Current technologies rely on the injection of gas bubbles near the hull , " says Professor Chang . <p> " Also under development are vehicles that have a superhydrophobic surface that can naturally sustain thin air layers . <p> " These technologies can achieve 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment demonstrates that for the best case scenario , an order University 's Privacy Officer at **30;1127;TOOLONG 
 <h> Pursuit home <h> Part human , part robot : The future of medical implantables <p> Pacemakers and Cochlear implants seemed like the stuff of science fiction when they were first introduced , and the newest generation of medical implants are just as mind-boggling <p> By Dr Alan Lai , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> A century ago , placing man-made parts into a human body to replicate lost function or prevent debilitating symptoms would have been viewed as science fiction . <p> Today implantable electronic medical devices ( ) , like pacemakers and cochlear implants , are widely accepted . But the next generation of these devices , powered by artificial intelligence , will once again push the limits of our imagination . <h> The first patient <p> In 1958 , 43-year old Arne Larsson of Sweden became the world 's first implantable pacemaker patient after a viral infection damaged his heart . <p> The first pacemaker was implanted in 1958 . Picture : Wikimedia <p> Dr. ? ke Senning , a heart surgeon and Dr. Rune Elmqvist , an engineer at ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental device that generated electrical pulses to prompt his heart to beat at a normal rate . <p> Arne Larsson 's cardiac implant was the start of a whole new field of medicine . Today millions of procedures are performed around the world each year to place implantable electronic medical devices into patients . Some , such as pacemakers , are life-saving , while others , like the cochlear implant , significantly improve a patient 's quality of life . <p> Nearly 70 years later , most contemporary still feature very similar technology to those early cardiac implants , and are in general hermetically sealed electrical stimulation and/or recording devices that interface with the relevant body tissue via electrodes ( metal alloy contacts ) . <p> As microprocessors become more powerful and energy efficient , implant capabilities have improved . Modern generations of cardiac , for example , act as both a pacemaker and a defibrillator ( monitoring the heart for abnormal electrical patterns and responsively defibrillating to prevent heart attacks ) . <h> The legacy of the cochlear implant <p> In 1978 , Professor Graeme Clark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implant , following more than a decade of research . <p> The cochlear implant was developed by Professor Graeme Clark and his team at the University of Melbourne in the 1970s . Picture : Ryan <p> In retrospect , the cochlear implant was the first generation of ' smart ' used clinically . The researchers developed a way to convert digitally coded sound into electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve , to artificially replicate sound perception . <p> The ' smart ' external unit , fitted to the patient 's outer ear , consists of microphones to capture sounds and a processor to convert the sounds into digital information . The information is transferred through the induction coil to the implant to stimulate the auditory nerve . <p> This triumph in bionics research created a legacy among researchers that is still very much alive today , with the University of Melbourne 's Graeme Clark Institute of Biomedical Engineering leading research on new devices that , just like pacemakers in the 50s , seem like the stuff of science fiction right now . <h> Implantables for the 21st century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , such as phrenic nerve stimulation to restore breathing function in patients with breathing disorders , glucose sensors for diabetics , sacral nerve stimulation for patients with bladder disorders , and implantable drug delivery systems . <p> And researchers are always developing new and improved devices . Professor Mark Cook ( now head of the Graeme Clark Institute ) is leading a team developing an implant to sit under the scalp to better diagnose and optimise treatment for epilepsy , which is even capable of reliably forecasting the likelihood of seizures . He is also conducting a study of an implantable drug pumps for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy at St. Vincent 's Hospital Melbourne . <p> Visual prosthetics , or ' bionic eyes ' are another very active area of research , with several groups around the world producing implantables to restore sight to the blind . There are two such groups in Australia - Bionic Vision Technologies is a spin-out company from research conducted by the University of Melbourne , the Bionics Institute and several other institutions . It is preparing to conduct a second human study and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vision Group , which is developing a system that interfaces directly to the brain , bypassing the retina and optic nerve , so that it is suitable for patients with damage to either or both of those structures . <p> But the ' holy grail ' for is in the area of brain-machine interface ( BMI ) , primarily to return motor function to amputees and people living with paralysis after experiencing a stroke or spinal cord injury . <p> Current technology already allows humans to use investigational implants in their brain to perform tasks by thought - like binary tasks ( answering yes or no ) , providing navigation directions ( using a mouse cursor , or a joystick ) and even controlling a robotic arm in real-time . <p> Exoskeletons may help restore movement to paralysed people in the future , powered by brain implants .

 <h> Pursuit home <h> Exploring the birthplace of monster waves <p> An expedition to the Antarctic explores where rogue waves begin , and what these monsters tell us about the way the ocean behaves and interacts with global climate change <p> By Associate Professor Alessandro Toffoli and Gillian Aeria , University of Melbourne <p> Share selection to : <p> Over the past 20 years , research has confirmed an increase in wind speeds and wave heights in our oceans - and it 's our planet 's most extreme locations that offer more information about how this is affecting the global climate . <p> University of Melbourne ocean engineer , Associate Professor Alessandro Toffoli , recently returned from an expedition to the Antarctic where waves and ocean conditions are the most extreme . Studying waves here provides scientists with the most comprehensive data on earth . <p> The reason for this is that strong winds and waves drive the exchange of heat and gas between the atmosphere and the ocean - contributing to the energy balance of the planet . At very high latitudes , waves interact with sea ice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our climate system . <p> In addition to acting as the planet 's refrigerator , the ice 's bright surface also reflects solar heat , which would otherwise be absorbed by the dark ocean . Additionally , salt left behind in the ocean by the freezing process drives large-scale currents , which transports cold water towards the equator and guides our weather patterns . <p> One of the most visible impacts of climate change is ice shrinking in the Arctic , and scientists are working to understand how this impacts our climate . Key to this is understanding how waves behave , interact with , and erode sea ice , and feeding this data into global climate models . As sea ice melts , there are greater distances of open ocean that increasingly stronger winds blow across , generating waves . As these waves build they accumulate more energy , slamming against the ice and breaking more pieces off . <p> And it becomes a loop of ice erosion - less ice increases the distances over which wind and waves can build , causing further erosion and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's geographically where waves and ocean conditions are most extreme on Earth . A study spanning twenty years has shown that wind speeds there have increased around ten per cent and extreme wave heights around six to seven per cent . The tallest waves carrying the most energy are found off the southern coast of Australia , and now peak between five and six metres . <p> To put this in the context of studying global climate change , Associate Professor Toffoli kept a diary of his time in the Antarctic where wind and waves converge with sea ice . <h> Day ONE <p> We set sail from Cape Town , the South African gateway to the Antarctic , at about 15:00 local time . Just outside the harbour , the sea starts to swell ... it is now dark outside and the sea is worsening a bit . Very few people show up for dinner ... it will be a rough night as we begin to sail the fiercest ocean on the planet . <p> Rogue waves were believed to be a sailor 's myth for centuries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Ocean . But we now have evidence that they are causing an increasing number of marine accidents . So part of our focus is working on the ability to forecast them more accurately . <p> As wind speeds and wave heights in the Southern Ocean are increasing , rogue wave encounters are becoming more frequent . These waves are monstrously steep , usually occur without warning and cause the most damage . Compared to the Arctic , the extraordinary environment of the Southern Ocean provides a nursery for monster waves to grow . <p> But unlike the Arctic Circle which is intersected with land masses , the Southern Ocean is uninterrupted , allowing wind to blow infinitely and creating an unlimited ' fetch ' , which is an area of ocean surface over which the wind blows in an essentially constant direction . Rogue waves can reach record heights of 26 to 30 metres -- that 's around six double decker buses stacked on top one another . <h> Day Two <p> We are rapidly moving towards 40 degrees South , where we expect to face ferocious winds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyage is fine and the ship motion is kept to a minimum . At dusk , winds increase as we approach the 40s . Wind speeds are so strong it 's hard to balance if we do not hold on properly ... the ship is shaking hard . These are perfect conditions to measure extreme waves . <p> The Roaring Forties describes the ' roaring ' wind speeds experienced 40 degrees south of the equator . As a result of the interaction between warm equatorial air rising , and the Earth 's shape and spin , wind speeds get faster the closer you get to the poles . At latitudes of 50 and 60 degrees south , wind speeds blow constantly over 50 kilometres per hour and are referred to as the Furious Fifties and Screaming Sixties . <p> The majority of the existing wave data is collected from buoys peppering the North Sea , Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico as a result of the abundant shipping routes and oil fields that require monitoring . Data from the Southern Ocean is scarce , so part of this expedition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean using stereography . <p> An example of a stereographic image used to construct a 3D version of the ocean surface . Picture : Supplied <p> A stereographic system consists of two , synchronised cameras capturing overlapping fields of view of the ocean . Similar to how our brain marries both images and uses the subtle differences to generate depth perception , computers are able to reconstruct the three dimensionality of the ocean surface using the videos . <h> Day Seven <p> After a long journey , we finally reached the sea ice at 61.5 degrees South . Normally , we would expect to encounter ice much earlier on the journey at the beginning of the winter , but the ice edge for this part of the ocean has retreated . This is the very beginning of sea ice and it forms in the shape of a pancake . Swells are six to eight metres high . It is spectacular . For hours the wind has averaged 72 kilometres per hour and it 's difficult to stay outside . But we manage to deploy a buoy and video waves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor the movement of the pancakes . <p> Pancake ice describes a type of round ice , like floating dinner plates ranging from 30 centimetres to three metres wide . These ice formations mark the marginal ice zone -- a dynamic and transitionary zone separating the open ocean where waves freely propagate , from the flat , white desert of compact ice . The marginal ice zone also shields the compact ice , tempering the waves attempting to penetrate and crash into it . <p> The movement of pancake ice can help researchers gauge the height of waves . Picture : Supplied <p> By monitoring the movement of the pancakes with trackers and videos , we are able to gauge the height of the waves propagating through sea ice and track their movement until the pancakes merge and freeze together forming part of the larger , compact ice . These trackers offer crucial information as to how the marginal ice zone migrates under the effect of wind , waves and current . <h> Day Eight <p> The time spent on the sea ice was short but intense . We conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we deployed buoys and took water samples . We are now outside the sea ice and the storm is still blowing . The waves are enormous . The ship climbs these waves very slowly , but it does n't feel like we 're moving forward . Looking out from ' Monkey Island ' -- the top deck of the ship - I can see a wall of water coming towards us . The ship is about 30 metres tall , but these waves must be at least 20 metres high . <p> As waves generated by the Screaming Sixties encounter the sea ice , some of their energy dissipates and only a fraction of their power penetrates the ice . <p> Although their energy is dampened , those waves that penetrate the ice can still travel for hundreds of kilometres , confirming our observations in the laboratory . <p> Antarctica is geographically where waves and ocean conditions are most extreme on Earth . Picture : Supplied <p> The physics behind wave propagation during storms is still not well understood which is why expeditions to Antarctica are such invaluable opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of global conditions ; and this will help inform models in predicting how the polar ice edges behave , which is fundamental to improving climate models . <p> Understanding environments like the Antarctic helps further our knowledge about the way the ocean behaves and interacts with the global climate , and that is something that will 's Privacy Officer at **30;0;TOOLONG
