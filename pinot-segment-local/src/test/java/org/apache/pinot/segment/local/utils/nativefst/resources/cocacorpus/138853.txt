@@98126890 @2326890/ <h> Frequently Asked Claims Questions <h> Question : <p> Can I obtain my own appraisal of damage for my auto ? <h> Answer : <p> You may obtain your own appraisal of damage . If you decide to obtain your own appraisal of damage , we will be unable to reimburse you if you are charged for that appraisal . In any case , it is necessary for an American Commerce appraiser to provide a written appraisal of damages before any repairs are started . <h> Question : <p> What if the American Commerce appraisal of damage is different from the one written by my chosen auto repair shop ? <h> Answer : <p> If the amount of the auto repair shop 's estimate is different from that written by the American Commerce appraiser , our staff will work directly with your chosen repair shop to attempt to obtain an agreed price for the work to be completed . <h> Question : <p> Can I begin repairs to my automobile when I receive the American Commerce appraisal of damage ? <h> Answer : <p> You may choose to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraisal is not a guarantee of payment . That is because the amount of the appraisal will be reduced by your chosen deductible , and by any damage listed on the appraisal that is not related to the loss . Your Adjuster will verify the coverage available to you . <h> Question : <p> What if I find out my vehicle is not repairable and considered a " total loss ? " <h> Answer : <p> The American Commerce appraiser will make the determination if your vehicle is repairable or if it is a " total loss . " A vehicle is declared a " total loss " when the appraised cost of repairs added to the probable salvage value ( the vehicle in its unrepaired state ) exceeds the pre-accident value of the vehicle . Your settlement will be based on the actual cash value of the vehicle . Your Adjuster will be the individual who contacts you regarding the settlement of your " total loss " claim . <h> Question : <p> What if my vehicle was towed to a storage facility or tow yard ? <h> Answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a storage facility or tow yard . Storage charges may be accruing and we can help you with the determination of whether the car should be moved in order to lessen these charges . <h> Question : <p> What if additional damage not included in the original appraisal is discovered while the vehicle is being repaired ? <h> Answer : <p> Your original appraisal is for " visible damage " seen during the inspection . Although every attempt is made to be as thorough as possible , at times additional " hidden damage " is discovered during the repair process . If this happens , the repair facility should contact the original appraiser who will then come to that facility to write a supplemental appraisal for any loss-related damage . <h> Question : <p> When can I expect payment ? <h> Answer : <p> If your vehicle is repairable , you can normally expect payment within 5 to 7 days after the appraisal is received . The entire process will normally take 7 to 12 business days from the date you reported the accident . <h> Question : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Answer : <p> Your Claim Adjuster will review what coverage is available for your claim . Once coverage is determined and the amount of your loss has been established , payments are made less the amount of your chosen deductible for that particular coverage part . <h> Question : <p> When can I expect to have my deductible returned if I have been found not at fault for an accident ? <h> Answer : <p> If there is another identified individual(s) responsible for the accident , American Commerce Insurance will attempt recovery from their insurance carrier ( if identified ) for any payments we have made . Our recovery attempts will include the amount of the deductible you have paid . However , the actual recovery amount will depend on several factors , including but not limited to degrees of negligence and the amount of coverage available under the responsible individual 's policy . As an insurance carrier we have no legal right to request your deductible from the party with whom you were involved or their insurer .
