Here are some tips to make the process a bit more manageable . <h> Set Expectations <p> In a large group it 's virtually impossible that everyone 's interests and personal travel tastes will be accommodated , therefore it 's important to manage group expectations . Set a clear itinerary before the trip so everyone knows what destinations or sights will or will not be visited . <p> Setting a clear itinerary will allow groups to avoid any potential confusion when sightseeing . <h> Choose Leaders <p> Large groups can split into several smaller groups to make the traveling process more manageable . In this case it 's useful to choose sub-group leaders who can better micromanage the individual needs of the smaller groups . Holidaymakers can then be sorted by their travel interests and assigned to group leaders . Artsy travelers can enjoy endless hours in art museums , while outdoorsy types can instead hit a hiking trail . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in all of the groups activities . <h> Receive Payment <p> Do n't get caught out . Instead aim to receive full payment from each group member well in advance of the trip . Sometimes , a deposit just is n't enough . <h> Reserve Air Travel 6-9 Months Ahead <p> Any group that wants to fly together should contact the airline to reserve their air travel at least 6-9 months in advance . Airlines will be more likely to have large quantities of seats available on popular routes and on off-peak days like Tuesday , Wednesday or Saturday . <h> Try Trip Planning Services <p> Specialty travel agents will be able to provide logistical support with everything from private bus transportation , group dining experiences and accommodation . Contacting the hotels directly is definitely an option , but it can be time consuming .

With over 27 per cent unemployment ( 57 per cent unemployment for individuals under the age of 25 ) , and the national debt standing at G627 trillion , the Spanish government has been forced to implement a raft of austerity measures ; measures which have been met with less a less than delighted reception by the Spanish public . <p> The economic crisis is still going strong in Spain , and although the country 's many tourist hot spots are still going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightlife in Barcelona or watch Real Madrid play in the Bernabeu , it is a simple fact that the once all-encompassing social systems in Spain are not what they used to be . As such , all travelers to the country should be aware of their options in the event of an accident or an emergency " especially in regards to situations where the visitor may require healthcare . <p> Spain may be in the midst of an economic crisis , but it still has a lot to offer visitors . <p> Prior to the economic collapse Spain experienced during 2011 and 2012 the country 's healthcare system was extremely robust and all encompassing ; Spanish hospitals and doctors provided some of the highest quality medical care in Europe . Similar in structure to Britain 's National Health Service ( NHS ) , anyone paying into the Spanish social security system was able to receive medical treatment at a government run hospital free-of-charge . This meant that , for residents , health insurance was not a necessity in the country , although 26% of all healthcare expenditure in 2010 came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and health insurance . <p> Today , the Spanish healthcare system is undergoing extensive reforms in an effort to alleviate the burden that the system placed on the country 's finances . With two new laws introduced during 2012 in the form of Royal Decree-Act 1672012 and Royal Decree 1192/2012 the Spanish government is attempting to implement stronger regulations as to who is able to receive medical treatment from the public system , while also updating the payment and financing system for available healthcare services . <p> Even though these reforms have been introduced against the backdrop of economic uncertainty and a growing need to ensure more accountability within the country 's social service provisions , the overall structure of the Spanish healthcare system remains much the same as it did in 2010 . <p> If you are registered to work in Spain and have been paying into the country 's national insurance fund then you are eligible to receive healthcare and medical treatment at state-run hospitals and facilities on the same basis as a Spanish national . Individuals and families who earn less than G100,000 per year , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who do not hold private health insurance or qualify for healthcare protection through alternative means may be eligible for healthcare on the same basis as Spanish nationals and may be accepted into the national healthcare system on a case-by-case basis . <p> So while tighter controls and restrictions have been implemented on the Spanish healthcare system as a whole , foreign nationals who are resident in the country are still able to receive high quality medical services provided at low-cost , or free-of-charge , through government-run state medical facilities . However , travelers should be aware that , for short term stays in the country , they may not be eligible to receive healthcare ( should it be required ) under the same manner as a Spanish resident . <p> Travelers who are citizens of a European Union member nation , who hold the European Health Insurance Card ( EHIC ) are eligible to receive medically necessary state-provided healthcare services during a temporary visit to Spain . It is important to understand that the EHIC will ensure that you receive healthcare under the same conditions ( and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish national insurance scheme , but it is not a substitute for travel insurance " the EHIC card does not cover private healthcare services or a return flight to your home country in a situation where you require emergency evacuation . <p> Despite austerity measures , Spain has a top-notch healthcare system . <p> Furthermore , travelers from an EU country should note that the EHIC does not provide protection against the costs of pre-planned medical treatment . If you are travelling to Spain for the express purpose of receiving healthcare then you will be unable to receive coverage against the costs of that treatment through the EHIC . However , it is important to note that even if you are receiving emergency medical treatment in Spain through the European Health Insurance card , you will still have to provide payment for services which carry a cost in the country " for example , this includes payment of prescriptions , which would be free of charge for residents of the United Kingdom . <p> Outside of the EU , Spain has a number of bilateral healthcare agreements with countries including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peru . Citizens of these countries requiring medical treatment in Spain are able to receive emergency medical treatment free of charge by providing the relevant healthcare certificate from their home country . In the event that an individual from one of these nations does not have their healthcare certificate on hand , they can receive reimbursement ( in much the same way as a traditional international health insurance policy ) through their country 's national healthcare system on their return home . <p> Travelers in Spain who are not citizens of a European Union nation , and who are not citizens of a country with which Spain has a bilateral healthcare agreement , including the US , are not eligible to receive medical treatment on the same basis as a Spanish resident . Consequently , travelers who fall into this category will need to provide payment for any medical services they receive whilst in the country . As such it is recommended that these individuals purchase a comprehensive travel insurance or global health insurance policy to provide healthcare protection for the duration of their stay in Spain . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same terms as a Spanish resident or if you having to pay for your care as a visitor to the country , you can rest assured that , in the event of an emergency , Spanish hospitals will be able to provide extremely high levels of care .

The country 's healthcare system has been designed to ensure that a medical center is always within 15 minutes ' drive from a person 's place of residence ; meaning that emergency assistance and treatment options are always accessible . <p> The major problem which many visitors will encounter when visiting a Spanish hospital is the lack of spoken English .

However , there are multiple regulatory levels which can apply to a range of different nationalities in different ways ; as such , it is important that you fully understand how these regulations and upcoming reforms will affect your ability to receive healthcare , and the basis under which you are treated .

So the best way to explore the city , especially the centre and Old Town , is probably by foot . But for travel across larger stretches of its urban environment , there are a number of public transport options . Buses , trams , and trolleybuses criss-cross the city and all are cheap and affordable . Night buses arc out from the city centre hourly until 4.30am , after which time you will have to wait a further two hours for the first bus of the next day .

There are also a number of other towns with fascinating stories to tell . These can be easily reached by train and bus .

Though it only stretches for a few blocks , it is densely packed with local and immigrant stores , and is an excellent representation of the city 's strong multicultural heritage . <p> Though most Torontonians are familiar with Kensington Market , the neighborhood still has plenty of new places left to discover , and with the help of Tasty Tours , locals and visitors alike can explore the sweet side of this eclectic neighborhood . <p> Tasty Tours is operated by Audrey Ooi , a 24-year old entrepreneur and food enthusiast who decided to lead food tours in her hometown of Toronto after being inspired by a chocolate tour she took in Philadelphia .

One example she gave was when Nike tried to open a store in the area and neighborhood activists protested by pouring red paint on running shoes and hanging them up in front of the store ! But really , what else would one expect from a place that proudly displays a huge mural of the Mona Lisa holding a banana ? <p> The famous mural of the Mona Lisa with fruit in Kensington Market .

But regardless of where you are going , everyone needs good luggage . Luggage is essentially just the storage space in which you keep a limited portfolio of your possessions , but it is so much more than just a bag for your clothes . Choosing the wrong luggage for your trip can be awkward , bulky or just generally unsuitable . <p> Luggage comes in a variety of different shapes , sizes , styles and weights . That is partly because there are so many different reasons and requirements for those using luggage in the first place . A quick flight across the state will probably require a small bag , for example , whereas a long vacation to Europe probably requires something a bit sturdier .

Many airlines specify the dimensions of the maximum bags allowed to be carried on their flights . You may have the option of paying excess baggage charges but these are frequently very expensive . Try to choose luggage that is of a more portable size , yet still offers a good amount of storage space so you can fit in everything you need . <p> Similarly , your luggage needs to be lightweight .

This makes it all the more important to choose luggage that is solid enough to survive the rigors of international travel . <p> Backpacks are a good choice for those traveling for extended periods of time . <p> You also need to think , from a practical perspective , about how easy it is to move your case around .

It may mean you have to hail a few taxis to find one willing to take you to your destination for the meter fare , but this should n't pose too much of a problem as taxis are plentiful . The one exception to this rule is when travelling from the city to the airport , a flat fee is usually the only way a taxi will take you , but these prices are often in line with the meters . <p> Tuk tuks are mostly for tourists therefore they are often more expensive than taking a taxi .

It 's not you or I because if we privately increased the supply of money to finance profligate spending , we would be charged with counterfeiting and go to prison . The Federal Reserve Bank , our central bank , is the only entity legally permitted to increase the supply of money , to bailout crooked financial institutions and finance Congress ' profligate spending . The Federal Reserve Bank while supposedly independent does not institute sound monetary problems and is in actuality the root of economical problems .

You say , " Williams , that could n't happen here . " Except during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1861 , our inflation has never exceeded 20 percent , but keep in mind that any hyperinflation was once 20 percent . <p> Knowing the dangers posed by central banks , we might ask whether our country needs the Federal Reserve Bank .

In the century before the Federal Reserve Act , wholesale prices fell by 6 percent ; in the century after they rose by 1,300 percent . Maximum bank failures in one year before 1913 were 496 and afterward , 4,400 . During the 1930s , inept money supply management by the Federal Reserve Bank was partially responsible for both the depth and duration of the Great Depression . <p> It is not wise for us to permit a few people on the Federal Reserve Board to have life and death power over our economy . My recommendation for reducing some of that power is to repeal legal tender laws and eliminate all taxes on gold , silver and platinum transactions . That way there would be money substitutes and the government money monopoly would be reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say steal from -- us through inflation . <p> The story begins in 1944 . After World War II , the United States was the only industrial power left standing . Germany , Japan , France , and other European economies were decimated ; their factories destroyed , their people impoverished . Britain , long the worlds dominant economic power and the issuer of the worlds reserve currency , was in similar shape . The pound , backed by the rubble that once comprised the worlds mightiest industrial economy , had been made worthless by the costs of war and could no longer function as currency by which international accounts were settled . The worlds leading economists met at Bretton Woods , NH before the wars end in 1944 to devise a new system of international payments and exchange rates ; what emerged came to be known by the name of the conferences location - the Bretton Woods System . <p> In this system , all countries would peg the value of their currencies to the US Dollar , while the dollar was pegged to gold at $35 per ounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currencies were determined in relation to the dollar , while governments were able to exchange their currencies for gold , effectively making the US Dollar " as good as gold . " If another country got into trouble and saw the value of their currency decline sharply , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , was able to make adjustments to the exchange rate regime and/or issue loans to mitigate short-run balance-of-payment imbalances and stabilize foreign currencies . In this way , member countries would not have to induce a severe recession or depression in order to cut imports and national income to a level that was within their means to fund . The IMF was able to use this leverage to prevent the adoption of policies which would have caused a nation to default on its outstanding debt , and to reduce the temptation of poor countries to embark on policies of economic nationalism - restricting imports and capital outflows - much to the chagrin of populist demagogues in many third-world nations . <p> This system worked exceptionally well for thirty years ; the post-war economic boom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . The United States benefited greatly from its position as the issuer of the worlds reserve currency . Since other governments had to hold dollars to participate in the system , the US was able to run persistent budget deficits and finance ever-increasing consumer spending and private investment without raising interest rates . While other nations had to either raise taxes or cut growth by raising interests rates in order to meet their obligations , the US was able to have it all - low unemployment , high domestic consumption and investment , low interest rates , low taxes , and high government spending . In effect , the rest of the world was doing a lot of the USAs saving , but the US trade deficit encouraged exports from developing countries and spurred economic growth . However , it began to show signs of strain in the late 1950s . The system from whence the USA enjoyed unimaginable benefits was reliant upon very good behavior to maintain the dollars prestigious position . The American public ultimately rejected the hard decisions necessary to do so . <p> Beginning with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US trade deficit began to increase rapidly . The Vietnam War placed an even more enormous strain the federal budget and thus the Bretton Woods system , as the US borrowed heavily from abroad to finance prosperity at home while it was undergoing enormous outflows of human and economic capital in fighting the war . When Nixon assumed office in 1969 , the situation continued to deteriorate . The central banks of France and Germany were piling up huge amounts of US Treasuries , and economists began to question how long they would be willing to pay our bills . The Fed induced a recession in 1969 , but inflation stayed elevated due to pressures on the dollar . 1969 also proved to be the peak of US oil production , and America was soon forced to begin importing oil more and more oil from overseas , greatly excacerbating the balance-of-payments problem . Nixon , always the cynic , was advised that the Bretton Woods was facing collapse , but decided that keeping unemployment low for short-term political gain was more important than the long-run health of the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " but we cant have unemployment . Nobody ever lost an election because of inflation . " <p> And yet , the only trade-off was in the short run . By 1970 , the crisis had become acute . US gold coverage - the amount of gold held in reserve to back the outstanding fiat ( paper ) currency - declined from 55% to 22% as more and more dollars were being printed to finance the fiscal and balance-of-payment deficits . Foreign central banks began losing faith in the ability of the Treasury to redeem dollars for gold , and began demanding their gold at $35 per ounce , a huge discount to the value of gold on open markets . Faced with a run on gold reserves , spiraling inflation , and an impending election , Nixon unilaterally closed the " gold window " - suspended the exchange of dollars for gold - implemented trade protections , wage freezes , and price controls . The Bretton Woods system collapsed . <p> A successive series of attempted devaluations of the dollar were unsuccessful in imposing discipline on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pegs . By early 1973 , the last Bretton Woods exchange markets were closed , and thus began the " Great Inflation " of the 1970s . Without the discipline of the gold-exchange system , other countries began attempting to print their way out of trouble as well , and inflation rates in countries around the world spiked . We in the US could no longer rely on other countries to do our savings for us , and the choice was either to tighten our belts , or find a new source of saving to bankroll our consumption . Enter Nixons visit to China . <p> Bretton Woods II <p> Far from being an altruistic visit to advance world peace , Nixons normalizing of relations with China had a very specific purpose - leverage the Chinese supply of cheap labor to enable the US to continue living beyond its means . However , it was Japan that played the most important role in the creation of Bretton Woods II . While Japan is often thought of as a capitalist society , the reality is much murkier . Socialism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during this time , generally meant government control over and central planning of the " commanding heights " of the economy - utilities and heavy industries - while leaving market forces to determine the production of higher value-added products . The problem with this idea is that the " commanding heights " do n't  actually command anything ; the true commanding heights of a market economy are not the heavy industries , but the financial markets . <p> The Japanese economy , while reliant upon market forces to do the heavy lifting , is controlled by high-level technocrats at the Ministry of Finance . In contrast to the import substitution models popular at the time , the MoF set about developing a policy of strategic development through export-oriented industrialization . They wanted cheap capital for their exporters , which was funded by forced savings through MoF purchases of US public debt . Rather than invest their export earnings to build up domestic industries , the Japanese plowed them back into purchases of Treasuries , thereby keeping the value of their currency suppressed and their exports artificially cheap . <p> Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1980s , the US again slashed taxes and ramped up spending , yet this time they were able to do so without causing inflation or sky-high interest rates because the Japanese MoF bought up our debt at huge discounts . On the back of the US fiscal and balance of payments deficits , the export-oriented Japanese economy boomed . But when the US economy slowed , imports did too . The " Japanese miracle " was revealed to be a massive bubble , and rather than let the export-oriented economy readjust to a more domestically-oriented one , the MoF propped up the existing economic structures . <p> With the election of Bill Clinton and the return of fiscal restraint , the dollar surged , but as the US ran fiscal surpluses , the supply Treasuries available for purchase by the MoF shrank . The MoF could no longer boost exports by financing the non-existent US budget deficit , the Yen appreciated , and rather than allowing domestic demand to increase , Japan entered a decade of stagnation . Yet , even though the US government was now living within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still posted trade deficits year after year , and while Japan still held vast numbers of US assets , China was on the rise . Chinas domestic economy posted solid gains throughout the 1980s and 1990s , yet their currency was still at artificially strong levels , making exports uneconomical . But following the Japanese model , the Chinese government itself began a weak-currency policy . <p> The Collapse of the . com Bubble and the Bush Era <p> The budget surpluses of the 1990s freed up an enormous amount of capital for private investment in the US , much of which went to hyped-up . com firms with no assets , no revenues , no earnings - but extraordinary share prices . Wall Street argued , as in asset bubbles past , that the old rules no longer applied . Consumers took out loans and bought huge amounts of these absurdly-inflated stocks on margin . They increasingly financed current consumption against the value of speculative stock picks . However , reality eventually reasserted itself , and when the bubble burst ( expedited by 9/11 ) , many consumers paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt they had incurred during the boom . <p> But rather than ensure an orderly deflation and market correction , the Fed slashed ( real ) interest rates to negative territory , while Bush and the Republican Congress pushed through massive tax cuts - even with the expected return to deficits during the downturn . While . com stocks plunged , the Fed and the new administration worked to ensure that the consumption-fueled economy that grew up around effortless wealth was maintained . But investors were soured by the collapse of the stock market ; real estate was the new must-own asset . Consumers , encouraged by their elected leaders , once again borrowed heavily to finance speculative asset purchases . Wall Street , now freed from the constraints of much of the regulation put in place during the 1930s , created numerous securities and instruments that enabled banks to expand lending to un-creditworthy buyers . <p> Bush and the neo-cons launched headlong into a war in Iraq and , like LBJ and Nixon , pursued a guns-and-butter policy of further tax cuts , massive defense expenditures , and huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but like Japan , China stepped in to purchase the new debt at huge premiums . Interest rates in the US stayed absurdly low . Despite massive government and consumer spending , and the trade deficits those necessitate , the US was spared inflation , unemployment , and the loss of its reserve currency status . <p> Yet , once again , economic reality reasserted itself . The real estate bubble collapsed , leaving many US households with negative net worth . The falling dollar , demand from developing energy markets , massive domestic consumption , and instability in the Middle East caused energy prices to spike , further squeezing consumers . Unable to pay the bills on their massive debt , American households began defaulting on their mortgages and credit cards . The financial system , an elaborate house of cards dependent upon increasing levels of consumer indebtedness , began imploding . And , like Japan in the 1990s , rather than ensure an orderly transition to more rational economic structures , the US government continues to try to prop up the debt-fueled " consumer economy , " oblivious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruits of the worlds labor is totally unsustainable and unrealistic . <p> And once again , we still we have no policies to move the United States towards a production-oriented economy . Rather than embark on the spending necessary to make this transition , they instead continue to exchange noncollectable consumer debt on the balance sheets of banks for US Treasuries in a futile attempt to bring back the good ole days of unsustainable consumer spending . Just as how they 're unable to grasp that the sky-high gasoline prices were the result of inadequate supply and unabated demand , policymakers seem unable to grasp the reality that this is not some random crisis resulting from illiquidity in the financial markets , but rather the overall collapse of the Bretton Woods II system . Try as they might , they will be unable to put the Humpty-Dumpty bubble economy back together again . <p> The difference this time is that there are no more Chinas and Japans to buy our debt and enable us to live beyond our means .

Consumers are unwilling to take on any more debt , and banks have learned the hard way that they cant extend shady loans to shady borrowers without consequence .

The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - just like the slaughter of World War I , the Vietnam War and countless other conflicts - were sold as battles for freedom , liberty , democracy , good vs. evil and so on . The Bush administration was hardly original in its rhetoric . It was though , successful , as the world is easily misled by it 's controlled media and fear of the unknown . <p> American Imperialists waging war for oil and wealth <p> The war in Afghanistan could not be more disastrous , both for the long-suffering people of that country , but also for the chief aggressor : the United States . And 2007 was the bloodiest year of the war - so far . <p> The professed concern for the lives of the occupied peoples is patently false . It is estimated that these occupations have caused over one million casualties , as well as establishing a permanent legacy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depleted uranium . <p> The American elite care little about human suffering . They are committed to the free market , neo-liberal economy policies that have seen a massive global increase in extreme poverty . They were quick to apply this economic dogma to their newly conquered Middle Eastern possessions . Companies like Halliburton made mega-profits for failing to provide services and infrastructure . <p> Today , the war in Iraq is totally discredited . The US overstretched itself trying to link Saddam and bin Laden , and even more so , in inventing stories about WMDs . The lies were necessary because the genuine reasons for the war were so perverse and cynical . Chiefly , the war was about the US ruling class trying to extend its power in the world . In this case they were seeking to rewrite the geo-political map in the oil-rich , and strategically important , Middle East . <p> Afghanistan and Iraq are essentially different theatres of the same American war . The US occupies both countries for the same reasons . Indeed the entire " war on terror " flows from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inevitable extension of the economic competition upon which capitalism is based . Major companies rely on the states in which they are based to use their muscle to secure access to raw materials like oil , and to arrange favourable terms of trade with other nations . <p> Imperialism is primarily about competition between the most powerful states in the world . And military strength is the ultimate arbiter of power between these states . This becomes clear when one considers how the victors of World War II were able to divide up the globe as they pleased at the conclusion of the war . The US and its ally Britain on the one hand , and the USSR on the other hand , simply carved up key sections of the world into " spheres of influence . " <p> Since the collapse of the USSR , the United States has been the world 's sole superpower . But as its economic position vis-a-vis other major capitalist nations has declined , the US has become increasingly reliant on its unsurpassed military might to shore up its dominance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production in the immediate post-World War II years , its share of global GDP has been trending downward for decades . And the figure has slipped from 30 per cent to 25 per cent in the last five years . <p> The Afghan and Iraq wars were conceived by the US ruling class primarily as a reaction to the prospect of US global hegemony being challenged , either by an integrated Europe , a resurgent Russia , or most pressingly , by ascendant China . When Bush declared after 9/11 that " you are either with us or with the terrorists , " he was effectively telling the rulers of all other nations that they must accept the right of the US to govern the world . Very few of these rulers felt able to challenge this statement at the time . <p> But instead of ushering in a renaissance of US hegemony , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have had actually seen a diminishing of US power . The reason is that the people of these countries have resisted in a most determined fashion . <p> It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last three years that the chance of the US salvaging some sort of lasting victory in Iraq is zero . As for Afghanistan , the occupation is now in its eighth year , with the insurgency continuing to gain strength . The US-puppet government has no legitimacy in the country , and no control over most of it . <p> As the left-wing commentator Tariq Ali put it recently : " To sum up the situation in Afghanistan , it 's a total mess . The US can never win that war , and the main reason they can never win is that Afghans do n't like being occupied . Afghans kicked out the British in the 19th century , the Russians in the 20th century , and now they 're fighting again against the US and its NATO allies . " Indeed , it is the right of the Afghan people , and the people of Iraq , to resist the subjugation of their country . <p> Rather than admit defeat , the Bush administration continued to obliterate thousands of US lives , and hundreds of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Congress , and now the presidency as well with the election of Obama , have done literally nothing to obstruct this process . <p> In fact , many key Democrats like Barack Obama have participated in preparing the ground politically for a possible future attack on Iran . Frighteningly , there are precedents from the last 40 years of the US lashing out when faced with inevitable defeat in a war . Even though the US had clearly lost in Vietnam by 1968 , they not only persisted until 1975 , but actually extended the conflict into Cambodia killing millions of mostly civilians . <p> We can therefore say with complete justification that the US military machine is the greatest threat to the peoples of the Middle East and central Asia . And the words of Martin Luther King during the Vietnam era , that the US government is " the greatest purveyor of violence in the world " , have never been more true than today . <p> For this reason , socialists oppose the entire phony " war on terror .

It marked the beginning of a now infamous convergence of interests , which saw the CIA , the Saudi Arabian regime and the Pakistani Interservices Intelligence Directorate ( ISI ) equip and train the Islamist mujahideen resistance to the Soviet Union . <p> For the US , this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been booted out of both Vietnam and Iran . It had been " the most humiliating half decade in American history " . Now they sought to hand the Soviet Union their own Vietnam by luring them into an intractable guerilla war in Central Asia . <p> Over more than a decade up to 35,000 fighters from the Muslim world were recruited , US$10 billion worth of aid channeled ( including , by 1987 , 65,000 tons of arms ) , and a " ceaseless stream " of CIA and Pentagon officials helped to plan mujahideen operations . According to Stephen Coll , writing in The Washington Post , " at any one time during the Afghan fighting season , as many as 11 ISI teams trained and supplied by the CIA accompanied mujahideen across the border to supervise attacks ... CIA operations officers helped Pakistani trainers establish schools for the mujahideen in secure communications , guerrilla warfare , urban sabotage and heavy weapons . " <p> But not only this . They gave support to the most retrograde elements like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . His followers , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing acid in the faces of women who refused to wear the veil " . The reasoning of the CIA was simple : The more fanatical the fighters were , the more brutal they were , the better they would fight so the more support they should get . Ronald Reagan - the same man who denounced the African National Congress and the Palestine Liberation Organization for not renouncing violence - described the mujahadeen as " freedom fighters . " <p> Reagan , now president , met in Washington with rebel leaders like Abdul Haq , who openly admitted his responsibility for terrorist attacks , such as a 1984 bomb blast at Kabul 's airport that killed at least 28 people . <p> Meanwhile , with CIA assistance , the mujahideen greatly expanded opium production in areas under their control - turning Afghanistan into what one US official later described as the new Colombia of the drug world . <p> One of the first non-Afghan volunteers to join the ranks of the mujahideen was Osama bin Laden , hailing from a wealthy construction family in Saudi Arabia . Bin Laden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with the most radical mujahideen leaders . He also worked closely with the CIA , raising money from private Saudi citizens .

" <p> According to journalist John Cooley , " the CIA gave Osama free rein in Afghanistan , as did Pakistan 's intelligence generals . They looked with a benign eye on the build up of Sunni sectarian power in South Asia to counter the influence of Iranian Shi'ism of the Khomeiny variety " . <p> By 1989 the Russians were exhausted . They indeed got their " Vietnam " . News of the Soviet defeat saw champagne corks popping all over Washington . The cold war was about to become history - the US had triumphed . But when the USSR finally withdrew , the administration of George Bush Sr. turned its back on Afghanistan -leaving it , in the words of The Economist , " awash with weapons , warlords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding from the Saudis and the US dried up , private financiers - like bin Laden himself - further stepped up their contributions to " the cause " .

" <p> In light of the new " war on terror " Brzezinski 's question is tragic . The hypocrisy is there for all to see : the " terrorists " of today were trained , funded and backed by modern imperialism yesterday .

Secondly because US oil companies have invested more than $50 billion in the region since 1995 and US agencies are expecting oil imports from Africa to rise from 15 per cent today to 25 per cent of total imports by 2015 . <p> The Council on Foreign Relations , a right-wing US think tank , depicts China as the leading threat to US interests in Africa : " China has altered the strategic context in Africa . All across Africa today , China is acquiring control of natural resource assets , outbidding Western contractors on major infrastructure projects , and providing soft loans and other incentives to bolster its competitive advantage . " <p> You might think that all of this economic competition must be a godsend to the destitute masses of the African continent . After all , capitalist development is what the continent desperately needs , right ? Unfortunately , the opposite is the case . <p> Nigeria , the continent 's largest producer , struck oil nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120-fold , with government oil-revenues increasing nearly 140-fold in the decade from 1970 . Yet as US academic Michael Watts points out , " Between 1970 and 2000 in Nigeria , the number of people subsisting on less than one dollar a day grew from 36 per cent to more than 70 per cent , from 19 million to a staggering 90 million . " The IMF could curiously write of this that oil " did not seem to add to the standard of living . " Little wonder , when 85 per cent of the revenues accrue to 1 per cent of the population . <p> Added to this is the environmental devastation . Constant leaks and spills in the Niger Delta have seen the beaches run black . The water has a constant oily film over the top , fish stocks are depleted and acid rain diminishes local crop yields . A group of scientific researchers who visited three of the nine Niger Delta States in the late 1990s noted " most places we went , the extent of damage was sincerely beyond human description . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil into the local region . <p> In most villages there are no schools , medical clinics , or social services , no clean drinking water and almost no paying jobs . People struggle to eke out a living , while all around them oil wells owned by foreign companies pump billions of dollars ' worth of oil a year from under their feet and from their own land . <p> A Human Rights Watch report on another major oil producer , Sudan , noted : " Oil development in southern Sudan should have been a cause of rejoicing for Sudan 's people . Instead , it has brought them nothing but woe . " It points out evidence of the complicity of oil companies in human rights abuses : " Oil companies operating in Sudan were aware of ... killing , bombing , and looting ... all in the name of opening up the oilfields . These facts were repeatedly brought to their attention in public and private meetings , but they continued to operate and make profits from devastation . " <p> Economic competition becoming military competition <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US is struggling to compete with China on an economic level in Africa - China just has too much cash to throw around . <p> The US has therefore concerned itself with combating China in a way the world to which has become accustomed - through the expansion of US military operations in the region . Although the US only has one permanent military base on the continent , journalist John Bellamy Foster points out that " a newly established base in Uganda gives the United States the potential of dominating southern Sudan , where most of that country 's oil is to be found . " <p> In West Africa , the US military has now established operations in Senegal , Mali , Ghana , Gabon and Namibia as well as developing a coastal security system in the Gulf of Guinea ( 80 per cent of African oil discoveries are here ) . <p> So Africa has now become a pivotal zone in war to secure a " New American Century " - the war to ensure the US remains top dog for decades to come . <p> Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV , the picture of Africa is almost always the same : A World Vision ad shows a malnourished child and the news shows us refugees and conflict . They do n't tell us why the child has arms like sticks , they do n't tell us why all these people are dying of famine . They do n't tell us the root source of violence in conflict areas . The news just gives us vague and racist commentary about " complex " " tribal " or " ethnic " divisions , without ever exploring how tensions arose or how we could actually make a difference by not stealing their resources . Instead all we hear is there is little chance of any solution . The picture of Africa is that of an eternally backward primitive society that desperately needs charity and aid from the civilized world . <p> Yet the reality of Africa is that the problems are primarily external - imperialism , oil and other multinational corporations - and the real solutions lie within . <p> All across the continent , there are combative workers ' movements - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Zimbabwe . These movements have led the way - fighting for democratic rights , striking over privatization , annulment of elections and for fuel subsidies for the poor , greater concessions from the oil giants , pay increases for state sector workers and so on . <p> This year alone there have been general strikes in both Nigeria and Algeria , two of the biggest oil producers on the continent , as well as South Africa . <p> The working class is the key to social transformation across the continent , firstly because of the enormous power it wields - especially in the oil-producing states , where just thousands or tens of thousands of workers have the ability to completely shut down the economy in an instant . <p> But secondly , because the working class is the only force which has an interest in genuine development . Generally the ruling class in oil states is embedded deeply in the State machine and survives almost exclusively on oil revenues . As far as they 're concerned , there 's no need for a healthy and educated working class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health , let alone sanitation , water and electricity . <p> This is not simply a mistake , or bad policy . For the African ruling classes ( not to mention the oil companies ) there is no economic needfor much civilian infrastructure - all that is required are the huge outlays on pipelines , ports and drilling machinery too keep the profits flowing . <p> Unless the populations themselves put them under pressure , why would they really care about the state of the mass of people ? They do n't . There 's no money in that . <p> So given the ruling class wo n't provide , the workers are forced to fight for their needs . The reality , then , is that there is a real possibility of the working class in these countries pushing forward - for example , to nationalize a country 's resources to ensure that the population , not the oil companies and the ruling elite , are the beneficiaries of the proceeds . We have already seen these sorts of movements in Bolivia and Venezuela in the past five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine development and decent living standards in Africa will not be a lack of compassionate donors from the Western world , but the military operations of the imperial powers , who want to see Africa remain crippled so that its resources can continue to be pillaged . <p> It is precisely because of this that impending military interventions into Africa have to be opposed . We will be sold a script about " humanitarian " concerns , but it is important to recognize that the imperial powers only care about humanitarian concerns to the extent that it enables them to sell another war for oil and empire - just like Iraq . <p> In order to hasten the decline of the continent the US and her allies , working with WHO , World Health Organization , has for the last 30 to 40 years purposefully plagued the land with AIDS and other crippling and deadly viruses . <p> Americans are as deeply in denial to their wrongdoing as Nazis were . They imagine that America spent three trillion dollars ( $120,000.00 per Iraqi man , woman and child ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create grief for Iraqis , all without killing any non-combatants . What nonsense ! Sgt. Frank Wuterich ( accused of murdering 24 civilians ) explained in a 60 Minutes interview that the US Military policy is to kill anyone who shows " hostie intent " That would include a child throwing rocks or old women screaming obscenities . That would include anyone who did not lie on the ground in submission something the non-English speaking Iraqis are supposed to automatically understand . He said that he and his men threw grenades into houses , without doing any checks first to see if there were any combatants . Their belief is the only good Iraqis is a dead Iraqi , that Iraqi civilians are worthless scum , so it is perfectly acceptable to kill children on the off chance they might kill a resistance fighter in the process . The American soldiers have lower morality than the Nazis in this regard . <p> The photos at the top of the page show the tip of the iceberg of the suffering of both Americans and Iraqis in the Iraq war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heist of the #2 oil reserves on the planet , callously masquerading as a compassionate regime change . The occupation and slaughter carries on without an official reason now that Saddam was captured and hung . That the Iraqis resisted occupation was justification enough for Bush . It may sound strange , but to Bush , the following images are erotically stimulating . <p> Most Americans are in deep denial that their country would butcher children and civilians , routinely torture , or bomb homes . Yet nearly every American saw this live on CNN with his own eyes on 2003-03-20 when America did its Shock &amp; Awe bombing of the residential sections of Baghdad on the opening day of the war . Granted , they did not see the blood spurting , but they saw apartments full of families being turned to rubble . Everyone knows perfectly well what happens when a bomb hits an apartment . Americans pretend the $2 trillion they borrowed for the war went for reconstruction . If that were so , every Iraqi would be living in a 450,000 dollar mansion . That money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paid to kill , not build schools or hand out candy . America has behaved worse than Nazi Germany . Americans plug their ears while praying for their soldiers , as if that would erase their responsibility . US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan have posted on the Internet " several hundred photographs of mutilated corpses from " the real war " in exchange for free on-line pornography . <p> American Imperialism <p> Watch this common sense video on how to take back America . <p> America ... Sinking Currency , Sinking Country ! Watch the below video on the causes of debt . <p> The British pound is back up over $2 , the highest level since the Carter era . The Canadian dollar , which used to be worth 65 cents , is worth more than the U.S. dollar for the first time in half a century . <p> Oil recently climbed to over $200 a barrel . Gold , down to $260 an ounce not so long ago . Gold has climbed steadily while oil took a nose dive , but will it last ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound and the Canadian dollar all suddenly soared in value in just a few years , while the US dollar has taken a global beating ! Now as of May 2009 the world is in a major crisis with plunging real estate value , tourism , commercialism and credit . S of Aug.09 the Feds just poured 2 trillion dollars of play money into the corrupt industries and markets . <p> The dollar has plummeted in value , more so in Bush 's term than during any comparable period of U.S. history . Indeed , Bush presided over a worldwide abandonment of the global health and economy . <p> Was it all Bush 's fault ? Alone no one man can destroy America 's economy and global status , but through his ignorance and willingness to let others do as they wish ... he has definitely did his share . <p> The dollar is plunging because America has been living beyond her means , borrowing $2 billion a day from foreign nations to maintain her standard of living and to sustain the American Imperialism . And printing trillions of unsecured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dollar is the massive trade deficits America has run up , some $6 trillion in total since the passage of NAFTA and the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1994 . <p> In 2006 , that U.S. trade deficit hit $764 billion . The current account deficit , which includes the trade deficit , plus the net outflow of interest , dividends , capital gains and foreign aid , hit $857 billion , 6.5 percent of GDP . As some of us have been writing for years , such deficits are unsustainable and must lead to a decline of the dollar . <p> A sinking dollar means a poorer nation , and a sinking currency has historically been the mark of a sinking country . And a superpower with a sinking currency is a contradiction in terms . <p> What does this mean for America and Americans ? <p> As nations realize that the dollars they are being paid for their products can not buy in the world markets what they once did , they will demand more dollars for those goods . This will mean rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent than we have been since before the Civil War . <p> U.S. tourists traveling to the countries whence their ancestors came will find that the money they saved up does not go as far as they thought . <p> U.S. soldiers stationed overseas will find the cost of rent , gasoline , food , clothing and dining out takes larger and larger bites out of their paychecks . The people those U.S. soldiers defend will be demanding more and more of their money . <p> U.S. diplomats stationed overseas , students and businessmen are already facing tougher times . <p> U.S. foreign aid does not go as far as it did . And there is an element of comedy in seeing the United States going to Beijing to borrow dollars , thus putting our children deeper in debt , to send still more foreign aid to African despots who routinely vote the Chinese line at the United Nations . <p> The Chinese , whose currency is tied to the dollar , and Japan will continue , as long as they can , to keep their currencies low against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their goals are strategic . <p> China growing at 10 percent a year for two decades and now growing at close to 12 percent is willing to take losses in the value of the dollars it holds to keep the U.S. technology , factories and jobs pouring in , as their exports capture America 's markets from U.S. producers . <p> The Japanese will take some loss in the value of their dollar hoard to take down Chrysler , Ford and GM , and capture the U.S. auto market as they captured our TV , camera and computer chip markets . <p> Asians understand that what is important is not who consumes the apples , but who owns the orchard . <p> Other nations that have kept cash reserves in U.S. Treasury bonds and T-bills are watching the value of these assets sink . Not fools , they will begin , as many already have , to divest and diversify , taking in fewer dollars and more euros and yen . As more nations abandon the dollar , its decline will continue . <p> The oil-producing and exporting nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the stash of dollars they have and stuff them into sovereign wealth funds , and use these immense and growing funds to buy up real assets in the United States investment banks and American companies . <p> Nor is there any end in sight to the sinking of the dollar . For , as foreigners demand more dollars for the oil and goods they sell us , the trade deficit will not fall . And as the U.S. government prints more and more dollars to cover the budget deficits that stretch out with the coming retirement of the baby boomers all the way to the horizon , the value of the dollar will fall . And as Ben Bernanke at the Fed tries to keep interest rates low , to keep the U.S. economy from sputtering out in the credit crunch , the value of the dollar will fall . <p> The chickens of free trade are coming home to roost . <p> To find out more about Patrick Buchanan , and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists , visit the Creators Syndicate web page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vaccines , Mercury and Fluoride <p> Dumbing of Children in the Education System &amp; Mass Media Programming of America . <p> Killing Themselves with Drugs and Pharmaceuticals <p> America ; The Lost Child ! Editorial submitted by ; Mike Smith Nov. 2007 <p> American wake-up call ! Is it not time for the world and especially Americans to grind their industries of war to a halt and once and for all realize that the billions of hard working citizen 's tax dollars are sucked into the vacuum of profit generated companies selling weapons of war to every corner of the globe , which are the main cause of global conflicts . The resources could definitely be put to better uses . America and most countries producing weapons are definitely not biased or selective in whom they sell their weapons . They sell them pretty much to anyone and everyone , dictators , corrupt regimes , neighboring tribes , etc. and will supply all sides in the conflicts , such as in the Iraq-Iranian war of the late 80 's . As a super power the leading dog in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given free reign to the war dogs and without batting an eye they continue to fund the development of new and even more deadlier weapons in a never ending cycle of insanity . And for what ... so some fat cat good ole boys can smoke Cuban cigars ... buy more beach homes and spend more time leisurely traveling the globe demeaning women in poor countries ? Is n't it time to fund alternate energy , build more and better hospitals , provide affordable health care for your citizens ? The USA , alone could end the world ' hunger , develop safe and clean fuel and other technologies to save our dying planet . They could fund greater scientific space exploration , spend more resources on curing diseases , and even fund free global universities ? If this vast amount of funds were freed up the USA could even spend a few billion on building safe electric rail lines across it 's vast expanse as alternate and less environmentally harmful travel . <p> Fear Mongering ! Now is the time to acknowledge that the cost for fear mongering is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the global peace promised at the end of each war ? The western countries consistently pretend to be under threat in justifying their global wars , but in reality they 're the ones behind the real terror . Seeking and demanding self empowerment they pre-empty vicious attacks on countries with little or no defense capabilities , as they continue to plunder the earth of its resources , and retain their statistical importance . Loudly and fallaciously these power brokering countries cry out in fear for their security , while proceeding to destroy the economy and livelihood of entire regions , mostly vandalizing the poor and hapless victims of third world nations . Blindfolding their own citizens with panic the western governments pursue what they believe to be their right to accumulate excessive wealth in maintaining their leisurely lifestyles . They definitely are masters of deceit in their continuance of strengthening their global bullying . Christians vainly declare their absolute redemption from their own self serving God , thus making it easier to accept their vile deeds of self-gratuity . These rich , obese and lazy citizens of the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs to the cries of millions of people suffering from war , famine , and disease , both natural and man-made calamities . Where is their logic , sanity and compassion , and most definitely ... where is the love for their fellow human beings ? America was once a nation of envy , of respect and gratitude , but now it 's a nation of fearing and loathing . Are Americans proud of their self-serving achievements ? Do they really believe in their ridiculous two party political system , which in its total and quite obvious corruption is ludicrous . The toughest decision these complacent people ponder is which of these malignant good ole boy law school graduates do they vote for ... asshole A or asshole B ? Either and you still end up in the outhouse . And to add insult to injury , perhaps as much as a billion dollars is spent on a single presidential election ... peeking into the realm of sheer insanity to say the least ! <p> With all the fiber of my existence and worldly experience I will never accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most to gain and when I hear the words " Trust Me ... Vote for Me " or my favorite ... " I will keep America Safe " I get chills up and down my spine . And to influx their self gratifying run for power ... they all proclaim to be God fearing people . Which God ... the God of Bullshit ? <p> By birth I am an American , my Mother being mostly a full blooded Piute Indian with my Father being of Scottish and Norwegian decent . I guess you might say that I am quite an odd combination of Viking and native American . My Norwegian blood drives me , while my Indian blood bonds me to the planet . Reading this article you might assume that I am no longer a proud American ? You would be correct in your assumption . As a child in America we were taught to feel pride in our country . We were coached to say our morning pledge of allegiance at school , to salute the flag and to always be thankful of being born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of other Americans believed , wanted to believe , in the fervor of the patriotic hype . They fed us their deceit as if it were chocolate candy . The patriotism , political and religious agendas created by our so called perfect forefathers and forever manipulated by every preceding leader , educator and preacher in continuing to perpetuate the lies . They have conspired in making Americans believe that societies elevated and self proclaimed are the appointed keepers of the moral truths and that they are the only ones wise or worthy enough to lead the common man and in keeping them secure and on the right path ... their path ! This directional conditioning was designed to keep the people under mass control , like mindless children , or as some would say ... slaves . Thousands of freedom diminishing laws and ridiculous regulations and more enticement for the their citizens to work harder , spend more buying fruitless objects of self indulgence , such as a bigger house , more cars , expensive jewelry and so on ... and making people believe that debt is as American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to wave the American flag and support your government even if it means sending your young off to fight and die in yet another war . The Whitehouse and Downing Street criminals are quick to bellow their cries for nationalism by spewing their mind boggling echoes of fear and patriotic rhetoric to energize the people into frenzy masses of hysterical idiots and then bleeding them of their monies . <p> The pulpits of religion and politics continue their mind controlling rituals of preparing the next generation of meek and obedient hard workers , tax payers and little tin soldiers . The psychotic misdeeds of these powerful bloodsucking mongrels cry out to our patriotism with catchy mottos like : " You have but one life to give " and " Its your duty to die with honor for your country " and " Your country needs you " and even more insane , " Onward Christian Soldiers Marching off to War . " Boy that one really perturbs me . Illogical fervor swells rampantly in citizens , making them feel even more obligated to their religions and nationalities . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with huge pay checks , but one thing that never changed is that the military immediately sets out to demean and strip any individuality from them , as they are ... after all , just government property , ' GI , does means , Government Issue . ' <p> Personally I doubt that anyone can substantially clarify the reasons America is a warring and barbaric nation ; a nation of takers , of people convinced that the world belongs to them and no matter what the needs of others they have the right to lay claim to the globe ' resources . No country spends trillions of dollars building offensive weapons they do not plan on using . Westernized nations have and will use their military might to take what they want ... whenever ... where-ever . With their massive armadas they believe that no nation can stop them in which does nothing more than leading to increased weapon proliferation of the rest of the world them taking defensive measures for global bargaining strengths . Western power 's policies of world policing provide endless and golden opportunities to meddle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite successful in their masterfully deceitful manipulation with bribery , threats , monetary devaluation , economical and trade barriers and when required ... naval blockades and even war under threat of total annihilation . Unscrupulous power plays and insatiable quenches of wealth keep the world in utter chaos and millions dying of starvation and conflict . <p> Why does the empowerment of 11th century doctrines of church and state still exist ? Why ? Because we , the people allow it to remain and continue to support the institutions that keep it in power . The USA was founded in war , waging bloody battles with our English brethren and then continuing to wage one-sided campaigns of murder against the rightful owners of our newly claimed land ... the indigenous Indians ... and so began a long history of warring for self proclamation . <h> Moral Values Without Religion <p> Does morality depend upon religion ? Most people believe it does , which is a major reason behind the appeal of the religious right . People believe that without faith in a supernatural authority , we can have no moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demarcation between good and evil--in life or in politics . This is the assumption underlying Justice Antonin Scalia 's assertion that " government derives its authority from God , " since only religious faith can supposedly provide moral constraints on human action . <p> And what draws people to this bizarre premise--the premise that there is no rational basis for refraining from murder , rape or anarchism ? The left 's persistent assault on moral values . <p> That is , liberals characteristically renounce moral absolutes in favor of moral grayness . They insist , for example , that criminals should not be reviled , but should be seen as tragic products of their " social environment " --that teenage mothers are just as entitled to welfare checks as wage-earners are to their paychecks , and that to deny welfare benefits for a child born into a family already receiving welfare is , as the ACLU declares , to " unconstitutionally coerce women 's reproductive decisions " --that America is morally equivalent to its enemies , with our own policies having provoked the Sept. 11 attacks and our " unilateralist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation of one nation by another . <p> Repulsed by such egalitarian , anti- " judgmental " absurdities , many people disavow what they regard as leftism 's essence : secularism , and turn to religion for their values . <p> But this is a false alternative . Secularism is simply a viewpoint that disclaims religion ; what it embraces , though , may be rational or not . And the absurdities of the left stem precisely from its irrationality--its pervasive emotionalism , its insistence on doing whatever " feels right , " its contention that there are no fixed truths , its credo that morality is anything one wishes it to be . The left maintains that no objective principles exist to validate moral judgments . From its multicultural equalization of all societies--savage or civilized--to its belief in an indefinable , " evolving " Constitution , the left rejects the logic of objective standards and enshrines the arbitrariness of subjectivism . Thus , what the left 's opponents should disavow is not secularism per se , but rather the replacement of a religious variant of unreason--blind faith--with a secular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leftist claptrap is a morality of reason . Such a morality begins with the individual 's life as the primary value and identifies the further values that are demonstrably required to sustain that life . It observes that man 's nature demands that we live not by random urges or by animal instincts , but by the faculty that distinguishes us from animals and on which our existence fundamentally depends : rationality . <p> With reason as its cardinal value , this code of individualism espouses fixed principles and categorical moral judgments . It demands , for instance , that the initiation of force--the antithesis of reason--be denounced and that an unbridgeable moral chasm be recognized between the criminal and the non-criminal . <p> Since life requires man to produce what he needs , productiveness is a moral value--thereby making moral opposites out of the industrious worker and the parasitic welfare recipient . Since life requires man to use his own judgment rather than submissively accept the assertions of others , independence is a moral value--making moral opposites out of the person ( or nation ) acting on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his neighbors ( or the U.N. ) . Since life requires the mind , man 's political system must allow him to use it , i.e. , freedom is a moral value--making moral opposites out of America , the defender of liberty , and America 's enemies , who seek liberty 's destruction . <p> A morality of reason counters the relativism and the undiscriminating " tolerance " of the left . <p> It also counters a morality of faith , and establishes a genuine " culture of life . " Individualism upholds your sovereignty over your life--and refuses to subordinate the preservation of that life to , say , the preservation of embryonic stem cells in some Petri dish . Individualism defends your inalienable right to your life , including your right to end it--and evaluates , say , opposition to assisted-suicide as a desecration of human life , since forcing someone to live who wishes to die is no less evil than forcing someone to die who wishes to live . <p> There is indeed morality without religion--a morality , not of dogmatic commands , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual . <p> Might over Right ; Does n't it bother Americans that every inch of their soil was wretched from the dead and dying tribes of free natives ? Is not America built on the graves of hundreds of thousands of these people ? Did not our admired and worshipped leaders of the past murder the native men , women and children in their unrelenting destruction of not only natives culture and right to exist they sought and succeeded in diminishing their future place in society . They were murderously seeking to actually eradicate them ? The few remaining and scattered tribal people were not even allowed to speak their native language or to practice their ceremonial dances ! <p> Today America persists in this practice of genocide around the globe and remain active in setting up their own capitalistic societies . America 's strong self interest beliefs continue to lead the country down the same destructive path , evident even today as they attack and forcibly occupy and wage unrelenting war against Afghanistan and the people of Iraq . Liberation or a thirst for oil and military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of American deaths and the million or so Iraq 's they continue to rattle their war sabers with threats against Iraq 's neighboring countries of Syria and Iran . <p> Are Americans and British citizens naive enough to believe that they can secure their peace by waging war around the globe ? Are their citizens naive enough to allow themselves to be led down the same path again and again ? To go marching blindly off to war every time the rich puppet masters blow their horn of patriotism and don their cloaks of terrorism protectionism ? Are the emotionally frenzied people capable of seeing the true reasons for their governments warring atrocities or are they nothing more than what their leaders believe them to be ... small children afraid of the dark ? Are you , the people , happy living as livestock to be led into constant self-induced chaos ? Take a moment out of your busy , but fruitless lives , and ponder the good we could do with the trillions of dollars and wasted ingenuity , along with the countless livelihoods of so many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is n't it time to stop the madness ! Get involved . Put your own life on hold and do something to better the lives of others , near and far . Do you part to stop the destruction of our living planet ... as it is home to us all . <p> Is America really dependent on War for survival ? At this time in our history I would have to say yes ! It is a matter of record that their government sold out their industries and their people and are now feverishly seeping away the common citizens right to work , to prosper logistically and passing the mass tax burden onto the working middle class . The America , government has allowed and encouraged their companies and industries to move their production facilities to 3rd world nations . Nations that provide no health or safety benefits for their workers and no matter their excuses and reasons ... they do it simply in order to increase the company 's profits . Everyone is searching for the fast and easy dollar and seem processed to earn as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the consequences . Americans sell out their country 's interest without conscience or regret . This mindset stifles the country 's growth potential and is now evident in the collapse of the Dollar , the housing and credit market , as well as the massive debit and trade deficit . America is borrowing approximately 2 billion dollars a day to fund it 's wars and to prop up it 's debtor lifestyle . Commercialism is all about quick profits and living beyond sustainable means . <p> The American government and their corporate partners orchestrate laws and ridiculous restrictions making it nearly impossible for the production of competitively quality cars , steel , glass , textile , including computers , stereos and other electronic products for export . It 's obvious to anyone with a brain that America itself is its greatest enemy . <p> Is America still a rich nation ? Not ' nobut hell no ! They nation is and has been for the last 8 years under the previous disgustingly greedy and corrupt Republican regime a debtor nation with minuses in every aspect of its domestic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and burden on the American people has sky-rocketed . America has billions in trade deficits with Japan , China , Europe , and other countries , America prints billions of worthless dollars and borrows billions from allies and adversaries like China to finance its Iraqi and Afghanistan wars . The debt of the country spirals out of control as the value of it 's dollar sinks to new world lows . Under George Bush the Euro had nearly doubled against the dollar and for the 1st time in nearly 30 years even the Canadian dollar had , for a while , surpassed the dollar . <p> Should America continue polishing it 's pride ? Pride of what ? America is not only the fastest collapsing global power it is the most loathed and feared nation on Earth . It is the brunt of international comedy , especially when our previously twice elected President opened his mouth to further embarrass us with his moronic and ignorant ramblings as he blunders his way through yet another repetitive speech about terrorism . Hell ' the man 's an idiot and a joke ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Is America a secured nation ? Not in the slightest . Why ? Well , when a nation wages wars and police actions on a global scale they create extremely dangerous situations , and even more determined enemies , and do it while depleting their own resources . Even if we changed our policies today it would take 50 years to rebuild Americas global respect and trust . To initiate the rebuilding of America we , as Americans , must retake our country by removing our heads from the sand and standing up to the corporations and our government by refusing to support them and allowing ourselves to be roll-cast . Did you know that the dreaded IRS is not even listed in any US Article as a branch of the government ? And did you know that the Federal Reserve is not even listed in the Governments Blue pages . They are actually listed in the white pages near Fedx . <p> America 's corrupt and unjust self-serving world policies will continue to decline it 's world 's standing as a global power , as they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever increasing scale . As a result America and her allies will continue to be despised and thus have no choice other than to live in constant fear of it 's enemies , real or imagined . The US is its own worst enemy as the nightmarish and fearful scenario scripted by large American companies selling their souls , and yours , for profits ... large profits continue . The major oil companies reap billions in quarterly profits while millions of Americans lose their jobs , their livelihoods and even their homes . Our Gov. bails out the greed and failed financial institutions and as soon as Wall Street markets go up , even a little , they proclaim the recession is over , but make no such claims or admissions of our failed social and economical failures . What are the western governments doing about the greed and market manipulations ? Nothing and why should they when their very livelihoods are supported by the very same industries they are supposedly regulating . Who pays for this ? Is n't it again obvious that you and every citizen on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often wonder why are the world 's most crucial commodities traded on the global stock market ? It 's entirely insane to allow greedy men and corrupt companies to profit by sky-rocketing oil and other prices with induced speculation and hoarding and/or dumping shares ? <p> Inept security policies . In their endless attempts to keep it 's citizens in fear America 's leaders bankrupt the nation with fruitless implementations of so-called security in the airports and placing metal detectors in schools , banks , etc. , but would n't dare go against the gun associations by passing stricter gun laws . Cheap and easily obtainable weapons kill thousands of citizens each year ! If that is n't bad enough the governments go even farther ... they consistently raise the limits of allowable poisons in your water , air and food . They seldom , if ever regulate the constant bombardment by the legal drug pushers , drug companies , ads encouraging it 's citizens to consume a never ending assortment of pharmaceuticals . In the midst of being over worked , over taxed , immensely burdened and pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen , the tax payer , must live in fear state sponsored terrorism . Do n't allow yourselves to be herded like cattle with sound-bites . Logic not hysteria should be applied ! And stop poisoning yourselves with drugs ... legal or not . <p> Ignorance leads to either hysteria or complacency and is n't your life difficult enough in daily turmoil without even more generated stress from political propaganda ? If you persist in living in hyped chaos at least do so with your eyes wide open . Question everything , doubt everything and always stand up for your rights ... not just as an American , but as a human . Ask yourself if security is truly elevated by giving up your water bottle , shampoo and fingernail clippers at the airport ? Is it really making you safer when airport security makes old women and young kids remove their shoes ? Facts are that billions of tons of cargo pour through your open ports in unchecked containers each month . But the Gov. would never impede capitalism ... just it 's people . <p> Are you safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats of so-called global activists the real danger when considering that your streets , cities and towns are some of the most dangerous in the world ? Americans , as well as 99.99% of the world 's populace are much more likely to die from a car wreck , bad food , a drug overdose , medical malpractice , or a common cold or even from drowning in your bathwater than you would ever have from being killed by an extremist . America is one of the world 's leaders in random violence and it 's citizens are more likely to get murdered by a family member or neighbor than a stranger . It leads the globe in murder , rape , car-jacking , robbery , random acts of violence even in spite of your country having more people per capita in jails and prisons than most any country in the world . It 's insane to have more young people behind bars than in Universities . <p> America 's educational system is horrific and problematic kids are simply guided through the system regardless of their grades . A country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where success is judged by the car you drive and/or the number of vain accessories you process and not by social or conservational involvement , such as doing your part in protecting the environment , charitable work or activities in stopping the actions of your out of control politicians . America has , had , one of the world 's highest GNP , but spends a great majority outside of it 's borders on global wars , policing , offensive weaponry , while it 's infra-structure crumples . Would n't the country 's resources be spent wiser by allocating a larger portion of it 's trillions on global peace initiatives , disease and hunger campaigns in impoverished nations , arms control and hundreds of other sane and humane activities at home and abroad . Is war really productive in the long term and is n't it simply a guise in gaining global dominance ? Are not the poisons of greed and self proliferation really the problems ? Americans and western societies are products of commercialism , radicalism , religionist self-righteousness and cultureless lifestyles . Their youth are out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being prone to murdering others for pride , for their cars , money , drugs and in some incidences ... even for their shoes . Americans and many European countries are deeply burdened in stress and a loss of personal freedoms and in that regard have become impatient , judgmental , as well as racists with temperamental tendency of instantaneous violence . The young are alienated , the old abandoned and the rest are simply stressed to death ... what can or could we expect from such societies . If the American dream is nothing more than being in a pit of debt than people really should wake up from their horrific dream ! <p> Watch the below video ; The Dumbing Down of America <p> Homeland Security ... what a play on words ... like so many words paraphrased in Bush 's 3rd grade speeches of sound bites like the constant referral to freedom , terrorist ... and his constant referral to God . I shivered whenever I dared to listen to his mispronounced words of rhetoric repetitively used in his brain-dead out-bursts , which to any coherent person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me , personally , feeling like I was trapped in a living soap opera . If having to know that the world is laughing at your president and your country in general is n't bad enough ... there is the constant news bites instilling a blackening veil of confusion on what 's really going on in the world . Taking in the consideration that most Americans know little about the world and even less about their country 's involvement in global wars , murder , torture of prisoners or the destruction of the environment . It brings to mind the insane proclamations from WW2 's Hitler , " Scream it loud and long enough and the people will believe anything . " <p> Home land security is a staged and well rehearsed play in America 's guise to keep the world divided and on edge . The leaders constant cry of " Wolf " instills blind obedience and fear in their citizens in order to keep their support . The hidden and sinister goals are not to be found in their spoken words and must be viewed at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of their actions and not their words may eventually become evident , but at a high cost . The leaders , rather political , religious or corporate spew their lies with utter disregard of the consequences and use the media to elevate the sheer panic in proclaiming that the very way of our Christian life is in grave danger from Muslims , and pretty much everyone , including immigrants , the Communists , the Chinese , Russians and so on . The repeated rhetoric provides justification for their global insurgency and police actions . The people of the world need to understand that these governments hide the truth that they , themselves , are the real threats . The global disruptions to peace and equality are central banks , climate change , wars , installation of puppet regimes , weapon proliferation , induced poverty , man-made diseases , along with Free Trade , NAFTA and one world policies are the real and eminent threats . The continuous mind boggling bullshit not only makes me angry ... it makes me want to take the first available space ship to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much that the governments are doing it , that 's expected , but its because the people actually believe the bullshit . " Oh , and by the way ... God will save you ... the sky 's falling and your investments are secure . " <p> The truth is that America , as well as their ass kissing allies , England , Australia and especially Israel , are the real terrorist nations . I must also mention China and their demonic involvement with the government and juntas in Sudan 's genocide of the tribal people in Darfur in removing them from their oil rich territory . China also gives their full support to the military dictators in Miramar and are deeply involved in controlling resources throughout Africa . And never mentioned is Israel compilation of over 100 nuclear weapons and that they manufacture nerve , biological and countless other dangerous weapons of war . Israel was one of the first nations to build these weapons and there are beliefs that they began the world 's nuclear proliferation , selling the technology to the USSR and/or China and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish controlled medias ! <p> Think about it ! Are n't the rich civilizations mostly the one 's involved in global wars , support of dictators , arms proliferation , corporate corruption , global scandals , and are they not the leading polluters ? Then there 's the pollution of our seas and waterways , deforestation , use of pesticides , unwarranted slaughter of animals and sea life , and all in their desire for exotic delicacies and unquenchable lust for novelties and artifacts , such as skins of endangered tigers , leopards , etc . It 's the rich countries that endanger the elephants for ivory , the dolphins and giant whales for their meat , the tiger bones for increasing impotent men 's sexuality , etc . How could anyone with a brain believe that eating the bone powder of a beautiful and endangered Tiger would improve their sex life ? The insanity spreads throughout the globe with the deforestation of rain forests , encroachment on animal habitats , the pollution of our rivers , lakes , oceans and even our atmosphere with every possible chemical and toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones invading , occupying , bombing , killing , imprisoning , and torturing , people all over the world , while passing out bibles and tainted vaccinations ? Do they not set the world 's policies , trade agreements , and global prices of all products and services ? Are they not the same countries that steam their warships and fly their bombers to every corner of the world ? I would believe that it would be most difficult to say no to any offered trade concession when you face such intimidation ? ? ? <p> The rich nations , especially the USA , Europe , Russia and China are feverish in their goals of arming , impoverishing and in overthrowing world leaders being of disagreement with their goals and policies . These countries have gained power and wealth by whatever means available , corporate , financial , theft , as well as bribery , support of corrupt leaders , instilment of puppet regimes , and even actual military force when required . Since the first fleet of wooden ships sailed from England , Spain , Portugal and Nederland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and military might to rob , rape and plunder the world 's wealth . They did and are doing so with total disregard to the local populaces and/or consequences . <p> The CIA , Britain 's MI6 , also known as SIS and Israel 's Mossad , as well as the Chinese and Russian state sponsored power brokers , all have their dirty hands in the world 's economies . They are in fact the perpetrators of the global distribution of drugs and armaments , just in exposing the tip of the iceberg . Wealthy nations did not and do not obtain great wealth with tender mercies or fair treatment of others nor by displaying concern for their planet . They are and will always be ruthless in their self empowerments . <p> The real drug cartels ! Have n't you noticed that the poppy fields in Afghanistan were being cultivated with new American supplied tractors ? Do you honestly believe that America invaded Panama to unseat a dictator ? A dictator that they , themselves , placed into power ! George Bush senior was a personal friend of Noriega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noriega , was an asset in the movement of Columbia 's illegal drugs . When Mr. Noriega became a liability Mr. Bush , at great expense to the American tax payer , ordered the military to invade , remove their elected President Noriega and regain total control of Panama and the canal , which had been agreed to be handed over to Panama a few months later than the American invasion . Again , the American people turned a blind eye and never even questioned their country 's actions . The billions made with illegal drugs contribute immensely to America 's budget of covert activities around the globe . <p> The above applies to Saddam Hussein in Iraq . The US put him in power , made billions from arming his regime than misled him in attacking Iran , weakening both countries economies and ability to wage war . Then the USA provoked him into invading Kuwait giving the Western powers the excuse they sought for destroying Iraq 's military even further . Years of bombing and severe sanctions and falsehoods of his capabilities eventually led to a full scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After billions of dollars , years of murdering Iraqis and destroying the entire infrastructure of the country ... America now has what it wanted from the beginning ... secured oil supplies . The war in Afghanistan was never about the Taliban or the so-called non existent Al ' Qaeda it was and is to secure territory for the building of a huge pipe line through Afghanistan 's northern regions and to build large airbases for the future invasion of Iran , which borders Afghanistan . <p> The American CIA and special forces are everywhere undermining the world 's governments and economies in ambushing and removal , or disposal , of anyone in their way . Their massively intimidating war ships cruise around the world , while their policy makers bribes , coerce and/or threaten every nation in the world for the building of their bases under the guise of protection . Then they forcibly demand the host countries to open their markets with bribery or bullying them into privatizing their resources , such as oil , natural gas , electric facilities and even their water . Once accomplished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purchase the resources and companies for a little of nothing . <p> Then the new controllers inflate the value of the commodities whereas the local citizens can no longer afford real estate , access to water , gas , oil , timber , minerals and even their own produced food products , etc . Do you really believe that Britain and America became the richest and most powerful nations on Earth because God willed it ? Even though these people believe that the white Christian race are God 's chosen people ? ? ? Is n't it more rational to accept the facts that it was because these nations developed ships and sent their explores around the globe armed with superior weapons . In the belief that the early Christian crusaders had the blessings of not only their Kings &amp; Queens , but the actual blessing of their God they were encouraged to discovery and commandeer the world 's resources at any cost ... even if it meant obliterating entire races of people . <p> The truths are in history , as waste was laid to the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aboriginals , African tribesmen , South and Central American natives and so on and so on ... Think about it ... has anything changed and are n't we now in the Middle East killing and occupying their land for control of their oil fields ? Are n't we still in Africa stealing their diamonds , timber , oil and the entirety of their resources . As commercialism 's greed for more and more grow and in supplementing their own limited access to land they coerce the Brazilians to burn down the world 's crucial oxidizing rain forests in order to graze cows for the world 's insatiable desire for more beef . The primary blame for this is another American profiteer ... McDonalds INC . Now our demand for more alternate fuel oils is enticing poor countries to cut down their forest and tropical jungles for growing soy beans and palm trees for palm oil . The rich buy the ivory in expediting the demise of the elephant ... the Japanese dine on whale and dolphin meat ... the Chinese consume a few million shark fins a year and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erotic food are pushing the world 's exotic animals and fishery to extinction ... and so it continues with no one ... man or God to stop the destruction of our planet . Prophecy or just man 's immaturity ? <p> America 's Industry . Consider that America can no longer even make a decent car , or pretty much anything else , they have for the past several decades used their industrial might and budget in perpetuating their weapons industry , while the country 's people are literally be led into greater and greater debt ! That alone should tell you something agendas . It appears that Americans choose not be too concerned as after-all they live in the land blessed by the God of Moses and David ... Jewish prophets and deity , nonetheless . America , the land of the free and the brave where living in blind ambience and debt , still manage to validate their existence as a God fearing people . Which God , oh yes ... the God written and detailed by Israel ... whom are , by self degree , God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are blessed by some all powerful Enmity having inherited his blessings and permission to do whatever they damn well please . First it was the crusaders , then the Portugal , Spanish , Dutch and English , and so on , and now America takes it 's turn in spreading their self serving religion and democracy and do it with the force of a so-called avenging Angel ... I believe its called the New World Order ! <p> Do I hate my country ? Absolutely not all the people , just the leaders , the hypocrites , the elite and those too dumb to see ! personally , I am not deaf , dumb or blind and while I do not believe to be better than others , I am fully aware of man 's inability to govern others with fairness and justice , much less with compassion and as we all know ... power corrupts even the most valiant of hearts . The world 's leaders are bestowed with power over their citizens and in such an elevated position it is most difficult when looking down on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aspirations . In general I would say that mankind is a very immature species and suffers from self awareness , self empowerment , self righteousness and an inability to understand the complexities of our planet fruitful , but fragile ecosystem . <p> Am I angry ? You god damn right I 'm angry and you should be too ! Why ? Because it 's all happening again in Iraq and Afghanistan and our leaders , being civilian or political are now beating the war drums against Iran . The seductress of wealth and power envelopes America and has driven her to conduciveness , unproductiveness with a sense of self empowerment . America uses more , wastes more and pollutes more than any other nation and it 's also well known that America spends the world 's highest percentage of their GNP , even going into immense debt , on weaponry in their endless obsession to spread their cultureless and commercialistic lifestyles in every region of the world . Prospering by greed , blindness and violence is a fast track to self destruction and as quoted . " live by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so true ! Who benefits ... the banks , which are the global financers of wars . <p> Wealth by any means has created a most dangerous social and environmental predicament in which I am not positive if mankind has the mordacity , ability and/or the will power to overcome , much less the inclination to give up their self-inductive lifestyles . To paraphrase an old cowboy proverb , " It seems we have a tendency to close the barn door after the cows escape ! " We just ca n't accept or absorb the realities that we are just one of millions of species on this planet and that each is co-dependent on the other for survival . It should be apparent that the American and western civilizations are not living in harmony with the world and are simply existing day to day , behaving like spoilt children ... well armed and extremely dangerous children . <p> Tried and proved for centuries by self serving politicians the art of deception in retaining control is used repeatedly in uniting the people against both real and imaginary foes , viral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creation of pending atrophies , natural or man-made and threats , real and imaginary , from those wishing to destroy , or change , their way of live , such as in wars with Japan , Germany , Vietnam , now Iraq and Afghanistan , and so on . During our 50 year cold war nightmare with our archrivals , the Russians and Chinese the world suffered immensely . Then we include our social and racial enemies , the Blacks , Mexicans , Socialists or Communists and continue our religious differences and once again declare war on Muslims by classifying them as extremists and terrorists . Crying wolf and declaring that our western way of life is threaten has worked in the past and is working now . Just more instilled fears rendering us susceptible to others rhetoric . Personally I ponder our logic in bankrupting our nations by spending our time , energy , talent and resources building trillion dollar arsenals of offensive , not defensive , weaponry . If America and Europe in general , are indeed under attack , as so loudly and repeatedly proclaimed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just do n't accept that we must fight our real and imaginary enemies abroad for safeguarding our security . Does n't global proliferation actually increase the danger by instilling fear and panic thus creating many additional enemies ... turning our neighbors and friends into foes ? Our ships , planes and soldiers wage conflicts around the world in establishing and retaining our global dominance in the guise of keeping the peace . The question is ... peace for whom ? <p> Why am I so harshly critical toward America and her allies ? It should be obvious that I simply want the America I once loved to wake up and get their asses of the couch , to turn off their televisions , stop waving their flags and most definitely to get their heads out of their bibles and stand up to their government and their profit driven corporations . The people are the country and need to reclaim their heritage and their societies back from the despicable policy makers and their corporate supporters . As an American I ask and demand that our citizens reclaim our country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How long do we intend to pray and wait for a mystical God to save and redeem us ? Please ... get involved with the issues destroying our world and realize that our real enemies are our fears and complacencies ! <p> Conducive behavior . Western in general , but all commercialized countries begin conditioning their children to function in very competitive societies that focus mostly on wealth and status-quo . Societies where citizens are evaluated by their university degrees , their jobs , clothes , cars , etc. but nothing is said about the great debt they have incurred . They are consistently led to believe that their way of life must be protected at all costs ... even if it means destroying the rest of the world , which includes animals , forests , oceans , the air and so on . A perfect mind-set for becoming excellent candidates for their military . Their parents buy them what they want ... not what they need . Do the children really need more war toys , violent video games and should they be allowed , even encouraged , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mayhem movies ... and to accept that it 's ok to hunt and murder animals , to be aggressive and to do onto others before they do onto them . They 're allowed to lie and cheat and are defended with sheer mordacity , even if their sons are accused of date-raping a young girl . These anti-social parents turn a blind eye when their kids consume large qualities of alcohol , take designer drugs , shop and spend enormous sums of money on the latest fashions , electronics and non-valued trendy gadgets and reprehensible clothes . After puberty they have usually been totally stripped of common sense and respect for others and continue their downward spiral of self destruction . Some dying of drugs or killed in cars and some imprisoned for being out of control . It is tragic , but predictable when their parents never took the time or had the willingness to get involved in their children 's lives . Then when the child 's live has turned out accordingly the parents actually blame their self created society for their kids failures . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove their machismo by joining the military . Then and if these unbalanced products of a disruptive society get killed in a bullshit war supported by their parents than we as a society whine and blubber like babies , blaming everyone but ourselves . We have been instilled with patriotic fervor to support our governments policies and thus are proud when our young men and women march off to war , but are then so quickly filled with hate and remorse when they are killed or wounded . We just never seem to realize that our children are our own products . These young soldiers have been militarized to kill and even murder proclaimed enemies by our self-serving governments . If these kids should return alive they are elevated and praised as heroes when in reality they are nothing more than institutionalized brain-washed robotic killing machines with no remorse and little consciousness . <p> Out of touch ! The people of our modern , mostly western , world are totally out of touch with themselves , the world around them and everything in between . In solving parenting deficiencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning . They are given credit cards and birth control pills at 13 and a new car at 16 . And the few kids , that do get jobs end up spending every earned dollar trying to be something they 're not . Splurging their money on designer jeans , latest cell phones , consistent boozing to impress other degenerates , they call friends . The rest of their time spent on idle chit chat on their $200 cell phones or messaging each other on computers , browsing porn sites , playing video games and the other endless and readily available assortment of nonsensical items of sheer vanity ? The really sad issue is they are n't responsible ... they 're just products of their society in pursuing the consumerism dream , while their parent were too busy to actually do any parenting . Parents of such socities were never made aware that they 're terrible at being friends , neighbors , parents , teachers , employees and employers and even worst at being human . They live and die in a small cubicle of work , stress , traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually believe they have a life . A fulfilled life is not being caught up in an induced comma of commercialism . Such a life is wasteful and truly shameful ! <p> The world 's governments have sold us out to the banks , the lobbyists and their corporate donors . We seem too busy to notice as we blindly chase the fucking American dream ... leading us further and further into debt and depression . To pacify our suicidal lifestyles we turn to a long line of pharmaceuticals and booze , making it somewhat easier to bear . Why do we strut our accomplishments but never reference our giant debts . Are the people really proud of having a heavily mortgaged house , that will never be paid off ; a new foreign car and other countless playthings like a giant plasma TV , remote controlled lawn mower , golf clubs , boat , a motorcycle and etc. that they seldom ever have the time to enjoy . People just do n't realize that their American dream lifestyle comes at a high price , not only in stress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jammed highways , diets of junk food , unsafe streets and schools , and an out of control government restricting our few remaining liberties and increasing our tax burden in order to bail out the Jewish owned banking system and on top of it all ... news of persistent sound-bites of non important rhetoric spewing from every Jewish owned network . Which all news is strictly regulated in accordance to networks FCC masters . ( FCC , Federally Controlled Communications . ) <p> Then we must discuss a few million lunatics with guns and drug infested slum areas we 're afraid to drive through even in daylight . We live and die up to our eyeballs in debt , but still ca n't afford to take a decent vacation and are consistently too stressed to enjoy a little romance with our spouses . Many live in constant fear that our out of control kids might hate us and in some incidences ... may even murder us for not succumbing to their daily demands for more money and unrestricted freedom . Yes , we should all be proud of our robotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then again , we are taught , conditioned and led to believe that our God will reward our worthless lives with everlasting peace in some spiritual paradisiacal heaven . And while we struggle to retain some sense of reality we are bombarded with fear mongering by our Gov. and police . Scared into submission of ridiculous searches and intrusive policing at the airports , schools and etc . Are we really ignorant enough to live in fear believing that some terrorists jealous of our decrepit lifestyle wish to destroy our screwed up way of live ? Now that 's hysterical ! <p> Commercialized societies . In this so called modern society neighbors and co-workers do n't know , or care to know , each others names , much less desiring to get involved with one another . Living in societies where it 's more unacceptable to incorrectly roll up your water hose than it is to shoot someone for trespassing . Our so-called civilized countries have far less freedoms than most any 3rd world country . In the US it is illegal to walk down the street or sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrarily put in jail for a traffic violation ... for having a miniscule amount of marijuana and so on it goes . Now people can be issued fines for smoking a cigarette in a park or on the beach . I saw a sign in an Orlando , FL. parking lot that read that " Loitering is a Felony " ... not a fine or a misdemeanor , but a felony ! Speak of a screwed up set of values . It appears that it 's perfectly ok to dispose of millions of tons of daily waste in the ocean or bury it in some virgin landfill and continuously spew millions tons of chemicals , carbons and etc. into rivers and atmosphere , etc. but we actually pass laws banning smoking a cigarette ! Talk about screwed up priorities ! Any level of logic would dictate that its insane to legally allow the pollution of the very air we breath with million of vehicles and factories spewing trillions of cubic meters of poison gases , chemicals and etc. that endanger our very existence . What ? ... smoking a fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the USA I have read horror news stories where some degenerate woman wanting a baby decided to invade a pregnant woman 's home , kill her , cut out the fetus and take the infant home with her . A country that bans prostitution , but spends billions in producing violent shows , movies and video games . Where men can be arrested for talking to a female on the street , which at times may even be a cop dressed as a hooker , but its ok to browse the web in search of extremely disgusting and degenerate hardcore porn . To live in a country where you can be arrested for a friendly game of poker with your friends in your own home , but can legally walk into a billion dollar casino and lose everything you own in a matter of minutes . A country where you can go to prison for smoking marijuana , but can legally buy , consume and even overdose on prescription drugs . A land where in every poor neighborhood there 's liquor and gun stores on every other corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for immediate and convenient redemption . <p> A Country where self righteous men dignity their existence by going to church on Sunday and then masturbate to images of young girls on the internet . These same men that group with drinking buddies at local bars getting plastered while screaming like childish morons watching a fucking football game ? Yet they have no time for any involvement with the issues that are destroying their world . They can not or will not devote any time in giving loving support for their families and never seem to take the time to teach their children anything of real value . Just a few more great examples of the American lifestyle ! The same lifestyle , which unfortunately is spreading like a vile spore around the globe ? Is such a cultureless society worth preserving ? ? ? A society of brainless money driven spiritless robots that actually believe that wrapping their house in plastic sheeting and duct tape will actually protect them from Anthrax ? Or that a plane and small fire actually collapsed the two tallest buildings in the world ... and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and further accept the lies that a jumbo-jet flew 10 ft. from the ground without hitting streetlights into the Pentagon , which it 's damaged was not filmed or investigated . The we are supposed to believe afterwards that some terrorist was spreading Anthrax , but oddly enough , only to non Bush supporters ? It eventually leaked that the Anthrax was from a Utah military research facility , but was not even reported by the news media . <p> Personally I was raised and educated in nature , camping , hiking , fishing , exploring , swimming and playing with my friends and my dogs . We swam in the creeks , rivers and lakes and never worried about contaminates or being murdered by some whacko . I loved star gazing , day dreaming , working on our small farm and basically just being a kid . When I did watch TV I had no desire to watch trash TV . I , instead loved shows like Lost in Space , Gilligan 's Island , Bewitched , the Andy Griffin show and so on . Today kids cut their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent shows of cops , forensics , murder and mayhem ... violent shootouts where guns and murder are glorified . Then some Mothers , supposed defenders of their children , become to lazy to cook and thus feed them junk food . The non working women lounge around watching soap operas that go on and on for generations . <p> And let 's not forget our music ; disgusting black rap and hip-hop about whores , guns , murder and easy money and never ending ghetto trash relentlessly blasting from stereos , Ipods , computers , TV 's and countless other gadgets . Think about it for a minute ... being raised and living in the mindless societies of America and western counties " just what the hell do you expect from the people , especially your kids ? Living in a country where honking the horn at someone can get you killed is definitely not where I want to live and especially not where I would want to raise my kids . A land where guns are legal but prostitution is not ? <p> America ... the land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only if and when superiorly &amp; overwhelmingly armed to the teeth with the latest high tech kill toys , so they can fight the wars without seeing the faces of those slaughtered . Why would any sane person want to live in a land that morns the death of one of their soldiers , but feels nothing for the thousands of innocent people killed in the war that we always start ? A country where traffic laws are strictly enforced with a high percentage of the police forces while robbery , murder and mayhem are more common and frequent than an average family going out for dinner . Crime soars while the macho police hide behind every bush , tree and sign waiting to pull you over for going 5 miles over some ridiculously low speed limit . They always have their hands on or near their guns as they walk up to your window . We must never forget the fact that traffic citations generate a hell of a lot of money for our screwed up judicial system . The law states if stopped ... stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paranoid cop can see them or he might just shoot you ... a few dozen times ... as happens daily somewhere in the USA . They are geared and instructed to issue as many tickets as they can , so it 's almost fruitless to try and persuade them otherwise . They make you feel as if it 's a deserved payment for protecting your safety . And heaven forbid if you 're not wearing your seat-beat ! There 's another couple of hundred dollar fine . In all irony a loaded gun on your seat may go totally unmentioned . Its just one of the country 's thousand or so warped concepts of selective freedoms . based on one of our archaic amendments that made a vague reference that we as good ole Americans have the right to bear arms and if we feel threaten ... we have the right to shoot and kill another human being for whatever reason we believe is necessary . We hold greater value on things than human lives . <p> Let 's not forget the patriotic bumper stickers on most cars and trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that the typical American even knows where the fuck Iraq or Afghanistan are located . Should n't we at least be obligated in learning how to spell the name of the country we 're destroying ? Hey people ... we 've fallaciously declared war on those poor people ... please ... give a damn ! <p> And is this , our American lifestyle , what we 're fighting and dying for ? What we 're pushing down the throats of others around the world ? Our fucked up culture of bigotry , racial despise , hated , impatience , intolerable treatment of others , as well as hunting our wild animals , and then there 's our self serving global policies , along with our malcontent , obesity , greed and cruelty , as well as our philosophy of " God loves me because I 'm a white Christian " So much bullshit , it 's frightening ! . The for all you people wearing your self-righteous asshole attitude cops and security guards , wearing your gun and badges around like you have the absolute right to kill someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not obeying your commands quickly enough ? This is the culture and lifestyle you 're protecting ? Your right to carry concealed guns and the absolute right to shoot someone for generally just pissing you off ? That 's not freedom ... its mayhem . Freedom is having the right and obligation to keep your government in check ... having the right to not roll up your fucking water hose , the right to sit on your porch or in the park and drink a beer or smoke a cigarette . Freedom is the right to walk you dog at 3:AM without fear of getting mugged or shot by a paranoid cop . Freedom is having the right to be gay or an Atheist without persecution . If I remember my history correctly ... is n't escaping religious bigotry and micro-control of our everyday lives by self appointed masters just a few of the reasons we left England so long ago ? <p> The British pound is back up over $2 , the highest level since the Carter era . The Canadian dollar , which used to be worth 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in half a century . <p> Oil is back on the rise . Gold fell off its recent mark . Millions have lost their homes and jobs and the world 's just basically falling apart . <p> Have gold , silver , oil , the euro , the pound and the Canadian dollar all suddenly soared in value in just a few years ? <p> Nope . The dollar has plummeted in value , more so in Bush 's term than during any comparable period of U.S. history . Indeed , Bush presided over a worldwide abandonment of the American dollar . <p> Is it all Bush 's fault ? Alone no one man can destroy America 's economy and global status , but he has definitely did his share . <p> The dollar is plunging because America has been living beyond her means , borrowing $2 billion a day from foreign nations to maintain her standard of living and to sustain the American Imperio . <p> The prime suspect in the death of the dollar is the massive trade deficits America has run up , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1994 . <p> In 2006 , that U.S. trade deficit hit $764 billion . The current account deficit , which includes the trade deficit , plus the net outflow of interest , dividends , capital gains and foreign aid , hit $857 billion , 6.5 percent of GDP . As some of us have been writing for years , such deficits are unsustainable and must lead to a decline of the dollar . <p> A sinking dollar means a poorer nation , and a sinking currency has historically been the mark of a sinking country . And a superpower with a sinking currency is a contradiction in terms . <p> What does this mean for America and Americans ? <p> As nations realize that the dollars they are being paid for their products can not buy in the world markets what they once did , they will demand more dollars for those goods . This will mean rising prices for the imports on which America has become more dependent than we have been since before the Civil War . <p> U.S. tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the money they saved up does not go as far as they thought . <p> U.S. soldiers stationed overseas will find the cost of rent , gasoline , food , clothing and dining out takes larger and larger bites out of their paychecks . The people those U.S. soldiers defend will be demanding more and more of their money . <p> U.S. diplomats stationed overseas , students and businessmen are already facing tougher times . <p> U.S. foreign aid does not go as far as it did . And there is an element of comedy in seeing the United States going to Beijing to borrow dollars , thus putting our children deeper in debt , to send still more foreign aid to African despots who routinely vote the Chinese line at the United Nations . <p> The Chinese , whose currency is tied to the dollar , and Japan will continue , as long as they can , to keep their currencies low against the dollar . For the Asians think long term , and their goals are strategic . <p> China growing at 10 percent a year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is willing to take losses in the value of the dollars it holds to keep the U.S. technology , factories and jobs pouring in , as their exports capture America 's markets from U.S. producers . <p> The Japanese will take some loss in the value of their dollar hoard to take down Chrysler , Ford and GM , and capture the U.S. auto market as they captured our TV , camera and computer chip markets . <p> Asians understand that what is important is not who consumes the apples , but who owns the orchard . <p> Other nations that have kept cash reserves in U.S. Treasury bonds and T-bills are watching the value of these assets sink . Not fools , they will begin , as many already have , to divest and diversify , taking in fewer dollars and more euros and yen . As more nations abandon the dollar , its decline will continue . <p> The oil-producing and exporting nations , with trade surpluses , like China , have also begun to take the stash of dollars they have and stuff them into sovereign wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy up real assets in the United States investment banks and American companies . <p> Nor is there any end in sight to the sinking of the dollar . For , as foreigners demand more dollars for the oil and goods they sell us , the trade deficit will not fall . And as the U.S. government prints more and more dollars to cover the budget deficits that stretch out with the coming retirement of the baby boomers all the way to the horizon , the value of the dollar will fall . And as Ben Bernanke at the Fed tries to keep interest rates low , to keep the U.S. economy from sputtering out in the credit crunch , the value of the dollar will fall . <p> America 's God . Consider that America can no longer even make a decent car , or pretty much anything else , as their industrial might and their budget is spent toward perpetuating the weapons industry and doing so at the demise of their own infrastructure ! That alone should tell you something about the insane policies of their leaders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too concerned and leave their lives and the future of the world in the hands of their self appointed God ... the Jewish God of Moses and Abraham . America , the land of the free and the brave and in immense debt still manage to find blind validation as a God fearing people . Which God , oh yes ... the God written in some old notes and scrolls transcript by Israel ... which are , by self degree , God 's chosen people . It is sad that Americans actually believe they are blessed by some all powerful Enmity and have inherited his blessings and permission to do whatever they damn well please . First it was the crusaders , then the Portugal , Spanish , Dutch and English , and so on , and now America takes it 's turn in spreading their self serving religion and democracy with the force of an avenging Angel ... I believe they call it TheNew World Order ! <p> Do I hate my country ? Absolutely not ! But then , I am not deaf , dumb or blind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , fully aware of man 's inability to govern others with fairness and justice , much less with compassion and as we all know ... power corrupts even the best of hearts . The world 's leaders are bestowed with power over their citizens and in such an elevated position it is most difficult , when looking down on your fellow man , to share in their challenges , fears and aspirations . In general I would say that mankind is a very immature species and is suffering from self awareness , self empowerment , religion and an inability to understand the complexities of our planet fruitful , but fragile ecosystem . <p> Self empowerment over others and our planet in general has created a most dangerous social and environmental predicament in which I am just not positive if mankind has the mordacity , ability and/or the will power to correct by changing the way we live . To paraphrase an old cowboy proverb , " It seems we have a tendency to close the barn door after the cows have gotten out ! " We must understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this planet and that each is co-dependent on the other for survival . It is also apparent that this is more true in American and western style of civilization where they live they fruitless lives of spoilt children , but sadly and most precariously , they are very well armed and extremely dangerous children . <p> And it has been tried and proved for centuries by greedy politicians that to keep the people under control they must unite them against both real and imaginary foes , viral or chemical , social and/or human . The most common are and have been potential enemy combatants , such as the Japanese , the Germans , Russians , Chinese , etc . Then there 's always the social and racial enemies , such as Blacks , Mexicans , Socialists or Communists and now if that 's not enough we 've included religious differences and declared war on Muslims by classifying many as extremists and terrorists . Crying wolf and declaring that our western way of life is threaten seems to be working as we sell our very souls to our fears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , as so loudly and repeatedly proclaimed , then why are the majority of our arsenals of weapons offensive instead of defensive ? Why do we proclaim that we must fight our enemies abroad in safeguarding our welfare when all we really succeed in doing is turning our imagined enemies into real ones ! Our ships , planes and soldiers wage conflicts around the world in establishing and retaining our global dominance , while pretending to establish peace ... peace for whom ? <p> Why am I so critical toward America and her allies ? It should be obvious that I simply want the America I once loved to wake up and get their asses of the couch , to turn off their televisions , stop waving their flags and most definitely to get their heads out of their bibles and stand up to their government and their profit driven corporations . In every global locale the people are the country and they need to reclaim their heritage and their societies back from the despicable Jewish bankers , political policy makers and their corporate supporters . As an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Have n't we been pawns and sheep long enough ? How long do we intend to pray and wait for one of our mystical Gods to save and redeem us ? Please ... get involved with the issues destroying our world and realize that our real enemies are our fears and complacencies ! <p> Conducive behavior . Western in general , but all commercialized countries begin conditioning their children to function in very competitive societies that focus mostly on wealth and status-quo . Societies where citizens are evaluated by their university degrees , their jobs , clothes , cars , etc. but nothing is said about their mind-boggling debt they have incurred . They are consistently led to believe that their way of life must be protected at all costs ... even if it means destroying the rest of the world , which includes nations , millions of people , animals , forests , oceans , the air and so on . A perfect mind-set for the young to become excellent candidates for the military . Their parents buy them what they want ... not what they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent video games and should they be allowed , even encouraged , or at least tolerated to watch an endless affray of murder and mayhem movies ... and to accept that it 's ok to hunt and murder animals , to be aggressive and to do onto others before they do onto them . <p> The pampered children of the decadent are allowed and even encouraged to lie and cheat in order to achieve their selfish goals and are then defended with sheer mordacity by their parents when their behavior is reprimanded . How many times have I heard the proclamations of innocence by parents when their children are involved in serious crimes . These social misfits , posing as parents , turn a blind eye when their kids consume large qualities of alcohol or designer drugs , or when they spend enormous sums of money on the latest , and must have , fashion trends , electronics , etc . These children of complacent parents , having never been taught to apply simply logic in their decisions , soon lose respect for themselves and others as they venture further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others killed in cars or shootings and even more imprisoned for their out of control behavior . The parents of these killed or imprisoned children whine and sob , and without hesitation pass all of the blame on the very society they created . Never realizing or admitting that their children 's failures lay in the fact that they , themselves , never had the willingness or time to get personally involved in their children 's lives . <p> Heroes or militarized executioners ? Conducive to the western lifestyles thousands of super competitive testosterone driven young boys are quick to join the military in proving their machismo , and in legally venting their frustrations onto others . The trained and physically , but not mentally , conditioned young warriors are quickly sent off to fight for their country 's agendas in far away land . Then , heaven forbid , that these unbalanced products of a disruptive society should get killed in the publicly supported bullshit war the families and their society in general bestow heroism on their young fallen warriors , but fail to questioned the war or their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hindsight and not foresight are the authors of history . How conveniently the blame falls on others for their loses , while remaining constant in their support of their country 's agendas . It is and has always been deemed patriotic to blindly and obediently bow to their religions and to their leaders . Personally I feel that these hypnotic behaviors are the real fault of our murderous contempt for others . How can we simply ignore that our young are being militarized to kill and even die in combating self proclaimed enemies of our governments . How can we elevate them to martyrdom and heroic figures of reverence , while ignoring the realities they are no more than institutionalized robotic killing machines . How can we not but blame ourselves for our blind obedience to our self appointed masters ... whether they be man or God ? <p> Out of touch ! The people of the world in general , and specifically people of westernized democracies , are totally out of touch with themselves , the world around them and everything in between . In resolving their parenting deficiencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 13 and the more wealthy children get a new car at 16 years of age . Then there 's the few kids that do get jobs that spends their every earned dollar in trying to be something their not . Splurging their money on designer jeans , latest cell phones and designer drugs , as well as constantly booze themselves into a constant state of limbo to impress the degenerates they call friends . If not working or in school most spend their remaining time in idle chit chat on their $200 cell phones or messaging each other on their $2000 computers , while browsing porn sites . With no real family obligations they also find plenty of time for playing video games and shopping in the malls for an endless assortments of readily available and mostly nonsensical items of vanity ? The really sad issue is they are n't responsible ... they 're just products of their society and are simply pursuing the American dream . The same dream their parents blindly labored away their lives ... never having the time or desire to actually do any parenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools and streets , unknown neighbors , timid teachers , and lazy employees and profit driven employers , and under these circumstances how could the people learn to be decent and thoughtful human beings . They live and die in a small cubicle of work , stress , traffic , junk food with rare opportunities of intimacy or leisure , but still believing they actually have a life ... sad to say the least ! Existing in their self made world of commercialism , where nothing else matters ... is not having a life ! <p> America 's governments have sold out their citizens to their corporate brethren , while encouraging the over burdened to blindly persist chasing the fucking American dream ... which is nothing more than a psychotic existence in a self contained maze of work , debt and stress where the only relief is self indulgence , booze and prescribed pharmaceuticals . Clinging to a false and mindless pride of living in a super inflated and heavily mortgaged house and driving a foreign car they ca n't really afford . The women of the West remain depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for items of self reward ... clothes , jewelry and tons of numerous playthings for their kids . The men also are being absorbed into the shopping for pleasure and just have to have a giant screen TV , a boat , new golf clubs and so on . This shadowy lifestyle is nothing more than bragging rights when his buddies are invited over for lots of drinking and yahooing at some ball game . Then to push themselves further into debt they charge even more toys like a remote controlled lawn mower , a new car or putting in a pool , or perhaps a motorcycle they have absolutely no time to ride . <p> To prove my point about citizens be driven into debt by becoming even bigger players in consumerism just count the number of brain dread commercials during one 30 or 60 minute TV show . Then watch the constant commercial bombardments from pharmaceutical companies that have succeeded in getting 80% of Americans hooked on dangerous and expensive chemicals . <p> People must realize that their western commercial lifestyle comes at a high price , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , jammed highways , a hasty meal of junk food from the multitude the joints on every corner , but more serious issues like out of control governments , wasteful spending , increased taxes , 34 million illegal immigrants , as well as daily laws depriving them of what few rights they have remaining . In America alone there are a few million lunatics with guns , deployable slum areas that most people would n't dare drive through even in daylight , and then to add confusion to mayhem there 's the constant bullshit bombardments of news-bites from the puppet casters of CNN , BBC , ABC , NBC and all the rest of the brain dead stations blaring out their governmentally approved rhetoric all in accordance to their FCC masters . ( FCC , Federally Controlled Communications . ) <p> The citizens working their very live away in anticipation of a better live and a secured retirement , but generally end up in debt up to their eyeballs and even after retirement they still ca n't afford to take a decent vacation . Is this the life you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax long enough to play with your kids or steal a few passionate moments with your spouse ? Does living such a live make you proud ? A robotic existence in a glass , plastic and concrete environment . And if such a life is n't bad enough you 're ignorant enough to live in fear of actually believing that some terrorists may be jealous of your lifestyle and wishes to destroy your screwed up way of live ? Sad , but definitely hysterical ! But it will be OK , after all you are a Christian and you do believe without doubt that your God will reward your worthless live with everlasting bliss in some rainbow paradise you call heaven . Sure ' and the tooth fairy lives around the corner and good ole Saint Nick will stop by for some cookies on Xmas Eve . <p> Commercialized societies . In this so called modern society neighbors and co-workers do n't even know each others names , much less get to know one another . Living in societies where it 's more acceptable to carry a fire arm than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized countries that can put you in jail for smoking a a joint and issue fines for smoking a cigarette in public places . A society that can jail an adult for enjoying a beer in a park or on the beach or even for parking in a restricted area . When in Orlando , FL. back in 2004 I saw a sign in front of a convenience store that non customer parking or loitering was a Felony ... not a fine or even a misdemeanor , but a felony ! Hell , I thought felonies were for criminals ? Speak of a screwed up set of values . Why is it perfectly legal to dispose of millions of tons of daily waste in the ocean or buried in some landfill and in the spewing of deadly chemicals and carbons into the world 's waters and air , but it 's illegal to park in front of a store or even enjoy smoking a cigarette in public or in a bar ? Does this seem rational to you ... to anyone ? Where 's the logic that would allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million of vehicles and factories spewing trillions of cubic meters of poison gases that endanger our very existence and " what ? ... smoking a fucking cigarette is so bad ! " <p> I have sat in awe at bizarre news articles on Yahoo and read an incomprehensible story just a few months ago where some degenerate woman wanting a baby decided to invade a pregnant woman 's home , kill her , cut out the fetus and take it home with her . Good ole America , where a grown man has to wear a seat-beat when driving ... a helmet when riding his bike and an endless array of other restrictive rules , but at the same time , as mentioned previously , can legally arm himself with as many guns as he wants or can afford . Mmm , this must come from watching too many western and gangster shows and movies for the last 45 or so years ? That would help explain while every man , woman , child and hooligan is armed to the teeth ! Then there 's the music , hip hop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell ' that 's logical ... , well , at least in America . Simply brain wash the kids with mega-million dollar movies of rape , murder and mayhem and let 's all drop our pants down to expose the crack of our asses while bopping to some ghetto rap , but oh ' sorry ... smoking is n't allowed ? ? ? <p> Condoning the film industry 's spending of billions of dollars in producing violent TV shows , movies and video games each year and in allowing your police forces to waste resources dressing up female cops as prostitutes just so they can arrest men for talking to them ... this is sane ? And is n't it acceptable behavior to browse the web in search of extremely disgusting and degenerate hardcore porn , but at the same time is n't it illegal to park your car in front of your own house ? Is this another example of living the American dream ? Why would any mildly sane person want to live in a country where they can be arrested for a friendly game of poker with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a billion dollar casino and lose everything they own in a matter of minutes . The same country where a person can go to prison for smoking marijuana , but can legally buy , consume and even overdose on prescription drugs . A land where in every poor neighborhood there 's liquor and gun stores on every other corner and , of course , a church at the end of the block for immediate and convenient redemption . <p> Is n't America a country where self righteous men dignity their existence by going to church on Sunday , but then would n't hesitate to have sex with a 16 year old girl or in locking their families out of their bedrooms while masturbating to porn on the web . A nation where so-called macho males group together on the weekends to get plastered and scream like pathetic losers while watching a fucking football game . Are not these the same men that have no time to get involved with their kids or much less actually give a damn about the issues destroying their world . Is n't America also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in plastic sheeting and duct tape will actually protect them from Anthrax ? The same people never believing that the Anthrax used in the 2000 DC and Florida attack was traced back to a US Military Research Facility in Utah .. surprise ... surprise ! ! ! You did n't really believe it was a terrorist attack did you ? Naw ... it was just good ole American politics and the beginning of a 8 year reign of insanity by Mr. George W Bush and his do anything for a paycheck ... cronies . Where the question of the day might be ... you want us to kill Bin Laden , Mr. President , but does n't he work for the CIA ? And then there 's Bush 's " Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction " that was nothing more than weapons of America 's mass hysteria ! <p> Personally I do n't classify rednecks , guns and hunting harmless animals and pickup trucks as part of any culture I would want to be associated . So is this the culture and lifestyle the terrorists are supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the lifestyle that the western countries wage war in spreading around the globe . Seeking to carbon copy themselves they are feverish in commercializing every section of the planet . <p> Personally I was raised and educated in nature , hiking , fishing , exploring , playing with my friends and dogs , swimming in the creeks , star gazing and just being a kid . When we did watch TV we tuned in to bloodless TV shows like Lost in Space , Gilligan 's Island , Bewitched , the Andy Griffin show and so on . Today the kids cut their teeth on computer porn , sexual videos from MTV , violent shows of cops , forensics , murder , and mayhem , violent shootouts where guns and murder are glorified . Mothers feeding them junk food , while watching soaps that go on and on for generations . And let 's not forget their music ; disgusting black rap and hip-hop about whores , guns , murder and easy money and other ghetto crap blasting from stereos , Ipods , TV 's and countless other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised and living in the sick societies of America and western counties " just what the hell do you expect from the people , especially the kids ? Living where honking the horn at someone can get you killed is definitely not where I want to live and especially not where I would want to raise my kids . A land where war is common , porn is accepted and where guns are legal , but prostituted sex between adults and smoking a cigarette are not ? <p> America ... the land of the free and the home of the brave , yeah , but only if their superiorly &amp; overwhelmingly armed to the teeth with the latest high tech kill toys , so they can destroy at a distant . Why would any sane person want to live in a land that morns the death of one of their soldiers , but feels nothing for the thousands of innocent people killed in their wars . A country where so much of their resources are utilized enforcing traffic laws , while robbery , murder and mayhem are as common and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> America 's restrictive traffic laws are enforced with Nazi uniformed macho cops hiding behind every bush , tree and sign to pull drivers over for going 5 miles over the posted speed limit ... even if it 's in the middle of the Nevada desert with no one else in sight . They pretend to be concerned for your safety as they promptly issue you a $200 dollar citation . A good example of " taxation without representation . " Heaven forbid if your not wearing your seat-beat when stopped , as that 's another three hundred dollar fine . Oddly , having a loaded gun on your car seat is not an issue . Its just one of thousands in America 's warped concept of selective freedom . <p> As good ole boys , Americans believe it 's quite normal to feel they have the right to shoot and kill another human being for whatever reason they believe is necessary , but at the same time panic when stopped by a cop for some minor traffic violation . I assume it 's because they know traffic laws are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states . Is n't just a little odd that a murder conviction can be appealed a numerous amount of times , but rarely can a traffic citation be appealed , much less over turned ? <p> So , if and when you 're a visitor to the wild west culture of the USA be extra cautious if pulled over by a cop . Stay in your car , do n't make any sudden movements and definitely keep your hands where the gun happy cop can see them , or he just might shoot you ... a few dozen times . " Hey , it happens daily somewhere in the USA . And be sure to read the various bumper stickers on most Americans . Most are quite funny and some are insanely illogical ... like , " God bless our troops in Iraq . " My question is always , well if God is blessing their troops and Mohammad is blessing the Iraqis ... then it 's going to be a long war . " Sadly , the typical American has no clue where the fuck Iraq is located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country their destroying . Hey people ... you 've fallaciously declared war on those poor people ... please ... give a damn ! <p> Is this American lifestyle worth fighting and dying for ? Are you wars and global policies worth the actual downfall of your country itself ? Commercialism is the contributing factor to the demise of our very world and yet you , Americans , continue allowing your industries to push commercialism down the throats of the world knowing full well it 's malignant effects ? Commercialism breeds nothing but a culture of bigotry , racial despise , self-hatred , impatience , intolerance , and the slaughter of wild animals , legally hunted to extinction ? Cultures of self serving global policies , international malcontent , obesity , greed and just general insurrection , and let 's not forget your all encompassing philosophy of " God loves me because I 'm a white Christian " As they say in America 's South , " Raise your feet ... the bullshit 's getting deep . " <p> Is n't America the home of the armed high school dropouts wearing police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot and kill another human being for shop lifting some over-priced clothes at a boutique or for simply not obeying their commands quickly enough ? This is the culture and lifestyle you 're protecting ? Is your interpretation of freedom mean having the right to carry concealed guns and them anytime you feel the circumstances are justified ... or simply when someone just pisses you off ? That 's not freedom ... its mayhem . The real meaning of freedom is having the right and obligation to keep your government in check ... having the right to not roll up your fucking water hose , the right to sit on your porch or in the park and drink a beer or smoke a cigarette . The right to paint your house any color you desire without asking permission from the local government ! Freedom is the right to walk you dog at 3:AM without fear of getting mugged or shot by a paranoid cop . Freedom is having the right to be gay or an Atheist without persecution . Do you in America have those simple rights ? If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and micro-control of your everyday lives by self appointed masters just a few of the reasons your ancestors left England and other bigoted nations so long ago ? <p> Bigotry is when the nation 's people turn their back on the needy and pray that God will save them . When people whine about pollution while driving a gas guzzling SUV in allowing the giant oil companies to triple gas prices in three years , which tripled their profits . Bigotry is when you you make a big issue of Janet Jackson 's nipple being partially exposed on TV , but do nothing to stop the endless flow of disgustingly demeaning porn sites . The same sites that your citizens masturbate to when alone on their computers ! Is this acceptable behavior and is allowing your kids to watch grotesque movies of violence and then not make the connection when some maniac shoots dozens of kids in a university ! ! ! Please get your heads out of your asses ... you created the nightmare , so do something to end it !

As of Jan 22 2002 Argentina 's collapse was inevitable , as under such threats they had just swore in their fifth president in two weeks . The IMF , International Monetary Finance provides cheap loans , subsidized mostly by the U.S. government ; in return , it dictates economic " advice " to the borrower .

Then the IMF suggests devaluing the nation 's currency , a kind of one-shot hyperinflation that allegedly " stimulates " the economy and encourages exports . yes , cheaper exports , less worker earning and turns the country into a basic sweat shop for Western interests . <p> It was recommended that the first component of the suggested IMF economic program was to devalue the peso by another 40 percent . Bear in mind that 80 percent of Argentina 's private and government debt is denominated in dollars , so borrowers would now have to pay many more pesos for every dollar they owe . Under this scheme , any Argentine business that had not already gone bankrupt surely would . <p> The IMF 's prescriptions are as far from the free market as you can get : unchecked government spending , higher taxes and government-induced inflation . <p> The results in Argentina were predictable . Higher taxes sent the economy deeper into recession . Then , early last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable currency system , made plans to demolish his work , proposing a thinly veiled devaluation that dropped the peso 's value by 7 percent . Last fall , he began hinting that the peso was " overvalued " and needed to be brought down further . <p> Investors got the message : He was planning to make the peso worthless . They bailed out , everyone raised prices , and the economy went into a tailspin . The final result ? The angry mobs of newly impoverished Argentines who rampaged in the streets in December . It 's the same cycle we saw after the IMF gave advice in Russia and Southeast Asia . The final assessment is simple ; , " Wherever the IMF goes , rubber bullets are sure to follow . " <p> Argentina 's refusal to agree to Enron 's criminal proposal and in allowing the IMF to ruin their economy led to the Falklands war , which was a farce from the beginning .

@@48313456 @1813456/ <p> General Information Redwood National Park contains the tallest living things on earth , evergreen trees that grow to 350 feet . The park was established specifically to protect these trees , because it is only here and in Oregon that these stunning giants survive . Descendants of the giant evergreens that grew during the age of the dinosaurs , redwoods thrived in moist temperate regions of the world . They take 400 years to mature and some of the survivors are more than 2,000 years old . Their thick , sapless bark protects them from fire , but landslides and wind can topple old trees . The Indians used fallen redwood trees to build canoes and houses ; commercial logging began during the gold rush era . Logging of redwoods continues and is debated by the timber industry and environmentalists . The trees stand as majestic reminders of the slow evolution of nature . Redwood National and State Parks represent a cooperative management effort of the National Park Service and the California Department of Parks and Recreation . Together these parks are a World Heritage Site and International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Inscribed in 1980 ) <p> FloraIt is estimated that old growth redwood forest once covered 2,000,000 acres ( 810,000 ha ) of coastal northern California . Today , only 4% , or 85,000 acres ( 34,000 ha ) , remain , with 45% of that total being managed by the park . The native range of coast redwood is from the northern California coast north to the southern Oregon Coast . The tree is closely related to the Giant Sequoia of central California , and more distantly to the Dawn Redwood which is indigenous to the Sichuan- Hubei region of China . Coast redwoods are the tallest trees on Earth ; as of September , 2006 , the tallest tree in the park was Hyperion at 379.1 ft ( 115.5 m ) , followed by two more named Helios and Icarus which are 376.3 ft ( 114.7 m ) and 371.2 ft ( 113.1 m ) respectively . Before September 2006 , the tallest living specimen known was the Stratosphere Giant , outside the park in Humboldt Redwoods State Park , which was 370 feet ( 113 m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply named " Tall Tree " in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park and within the RNSP was measured at 367.8 feet ( 112.11 m ) , but the top 10 feet ( 3 m ) of the tree was reported to have died in the 1990s . One tree that fell in 1991 was reported to be 372.04 feet ( 113.4 m ) . Only the Giant Sequoia has more mass . The largest redwood by volume is the 42,500 cubic foot ( 1,205 m ) " Lost Monarch " , located in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park . Mature Coast redwoods live an average of 800-1500 years and a few are documented to be 2,000 years old , making them some of the longest-living organisms on earth . They are highly resistant to disease , due to a thick protective bark and high tannin content . Redwoods prefer sheltered slopes , slightly inland and near water sources such as rivers and streams , and are very fast-growing . <h> Coastline areaBoth coastline and the Coast Mountain Ranges can be found within park boundaries . The majority of the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uplifted from the ocean floor millions of years ago . These sedimentary rocks are primarily sandstones , siltstones , and varieties of shale , with lesser amounts of metamorphic rocks such as chert and greenstone . For the most part , these rocks are easily eroded , and can be viewed along the seacoast and where rivers and streams have cut small gorges . Formed during the Cretaceous age , they are highly deformed from uplift and folding processes . In some areas , river systems have created fluvial deposits of sandstones , mudstones , and conglomerates , which are transported into the park from upstream . Redwood Creek follows the Grogan Fault ; along the west bank of the creek , schist and other metamorphic rocks can be found , while sedimentary rocks of the Franciscan Assemblage are located on the east bank . <p> RecreationOther than the DeMartin Redwood Youth Hostel , a low-amenities shared lodging facility ( near Klamath ) , there are no hotels or motels within the parks boundaries . However , nearby towns provide small hotels and inns , with extensive lodging options available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern end of the park and Arcata and Eureka located to the south . The park is 340 miles ( 550 km ) north of San Francisco , California , and 330 miles ( 530 km ) south of Portland , Oregon , and U.S. Route 101 passes through it from north to south . The Smith River National Recreation Area , part of the Six Rivers National Forest , is adjacent to the north end of RNSP . <p> While the state parks have front country campsites that can be driven to , the federal sections of the park do not , and hiking is the only way of reaching back country campsites . These are at Mill Creek campground in Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park and Jedediah Smith campground in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park , which together have 251 campsites , the Elk Prairie campground in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park which has 75 , and the Gold Bluffs Beach campground which has 25 campsites .

Back country camping is by permit only and is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redwood Creek . <p> Fire hazards limit camping in the back country to five consecutive nights , and 15 nights in any one year . Proper food storage to minimize encounters with bears is strongly enforced , and hikers and backpackers are required to take out any trash they generate . <p> Almost 200 miles ( 320 km ) of hiking trails exist in the parks , but during the rainy season some temporary footbridges are removed , as they would be destroyed by high streams . Throughout the year , trails are often wet and hikers need to be well prepared for rainy weather and consult information centers for updates on trail conditions . <p> Horseback riding and mountain biking are popular but are only allowed on certain trails . Kayaking is popular along the seacoast and in the various rivers and streams . Kayakers and canoeists frequently travel the Smith River , which is the longest un-dammed river remaining in California .

Despite its name , this is not actually a canyon , but rather a giant natural amphitheater created by erosion along the eastern side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau . Bryce is distinctive due to its geological structures , called hoodoos , formed from wind , water , and ice erosion of the river and lakebed sedimentary rocks . The red , orange and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views to visitors . <p> Bryce is at a much higher elevation than nearby Zion National Park and the Grand Canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet ( 2400 to 2700 m ) , whereas the south rim of the Grand Canyon sits at 7,000 feet ( 2100 m ) above sea level . The area therefore has a very different ecology and climate , and thus offers a contrast for visitors to the region ( who often visit all three parks in a single vacation ) . <p> The canyon area was settled by Mormon pioneers in the 1850s and was named after Ebenezer Bryce , who homesteaded in the area in 1875 . The area around Bryce Canyon became a U.S. National Monument in 1924 and was designated as a national park in 1928 . The park covers 56 mi ( 145 km ) . The park receives relatively few visitors compared to Zion Canyon and the Grand Canyon , largely due to its remote location .

The land is semi-arid and consists of raised plateaus and structural basins typical of the southwestern United States . Drainage systems have cut deeply through the rock , forming numerous steep-walled canyons . Forests are found at higher elevations while the lower elevations are comprised of a series of desert basins . <p> Well known for its geologic significance , the Grand Canyon is one of the most studied geologic landscapes in the world . It offers an excellent record of three of the four eras of geological time , a rich and diverse fossil record , a vast array of geologic features and rock types , and numerous caves containing extensive and significant geological , paleontological , archeological and biological resources . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . The Canyon , incised by the Colorado River , is immense , averaging 4,000 feet deep for its entire 277 miles . It is 6,000 feet deep at its deepest point and 15 miles at its widest . However , the significance of Grand Canyon is not limited to its geology . <p> The Park contains several major ecosystems . Its great biological diversity can be attributed to the presence of five of the seven life zones and three of the four desert types in North America . The five life zones represented are the Lower Sonoran , Upper Sonoran , Transition , Canadian , and Hudsonian . This is equivalent to traveling from Mexico to Canada . The Park also serves as an ecological refuge , with relatively undisturbed remnants of dwindling ecosystems ( such as boreal forest and desert riparian communities ) . It is home to numerous rare , endemic ( found only at Grand Canyon ) , and specially protected ( threatened/endangered ) plant and animal species . Over 1,500 plant , 355 bird , 89 mammalian , 47 reptile , 9 amphibian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Grand Canyon is considered one of the natural wonders of the world largely because of its natural features . The exposed geologic strata - layer upon layer from the basement Vishnu schist to the capping Kaibab limestone - rise over a mile above the river , representing one of the most complete records of geological history that can be seen anywhere in the world . Geologic formations such as gneiss and schist found at the bottom of the Canyon date back 1,800 million years . This geologic incline creates a diversity of biotic communities , and five of the seven life zones are present in the park . <p> The entire park area is considered to be semi-arid desert , but distinct habitats are located at different elevations along the 8,000 foot elevation gradient . Near the Colorado River , riparian vegetation and sandy beaches prevail . Just above the river corridor a desert scrub community exists complete with a wide variety of cacti and warm desert scrub species . A pinion pine and juniper forest grows above the desert scrub up to 6,200 feet , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the North Rim at elevations above 8,200 feet , a spruce-fir forest tops out the park . <p> As in all natural habitats , the type and abundance of organisms is directly related to the presence or absence of water . The Colorado River and its tributaries , as well as springs , seeps , stock tanks and ephemeral pools provide oases to flora and fauna in this semi-arid southwest desert area . <p> The arid climate has been a benefit to the Paleontological resources of the park . The dry climate has been instrumental in preserving many prehistoric fossils deep within caves in Grand Canyon 's geologic formations . <p> ClimateSUMMER temperatures on the South Rim are relatively pleasant . North Rim temperatures are a few degrees cooler due to the higher elevation . Inner canyon temperatures are extreme . Daytime highs at the river often exceed 105F . Thunderstorms frequently occur during July , August , and early September . <p> WINTER conditions on the South Rim can be extreme .

@@48313529 @1813529/ <p> Barcelona is one of the world 's great city break destinations . However , perhaps the thought of staying in a city hotel and paying a lot for the holiday puts many travelers off the idea . It certainly is n't the cheapest city in the world to take a holiday with a family , but staying in a campsite like El Delfin Verde in Torroella de Montgri could provide a more affordable way of seeing the delights of Barcelona . Here are five reasons to consider the option : <h> 1 . Get a Good Value Break <p> One of the reasons why camping holidays have traditionally been popular with families is that they offer great value for money . This means that travelers could stay for longer than they might be able to afford in a hotel .

Barcelona has some staggering pieces of architecture such as La Sagrada Familia and a lot of culture and art . However , these are n't exactly attractions which appeal to a lot of youngsters . The good news is that many modern campsites offer the chance to go to the beach , go for a walk in lovely countryside or do any one a number of other things which are n't so easy to do from the base of a city hotel . <p> The Sagrada Familia is famed architect Gaudis Requiem , as its still under construction more than 100 years later . <h> 5 .

No chlorine to burn your eyes , but as clean as water anywhere ! When we arrived in Brisbane around the 8th of July 2002 we knew that we wanted to lodge close to the river , but not right downtown where the city noise would disturb our sleep .

Its not the Ritz or the Hilton , it is just a good hotel for families or anyone that does n't  want to spend their entire vacation money on a room . The baths are large and yes , you do have to walk a few steps down the hall , but that adds mystique to the hotel . <p> The hotel is owned and operated by a very tall and friendly man .

@@48313550 @1813550/ <p> Travelers Digest toured the greater pacific in 2002 and , while in New Zealand , was fortunate to visit the area known as Tongariro . This particular region of New Zealand has been the inspiration of several great books . Your brain does n't  quite know how to absorb this awesome country with so many massive contrasts . There is a giant active volcano known as Mt . Ruapehu fairly in the middle of the region and the landscape around the volcano is lunar and covered with jagged rocks . If I wanted to film a movie about the planet Mars , this is where I would do it . It is absolutely overwhelming . In the middle of this barren , but scenic land , we were scheduled to stay in a mountain lodge .

The lodge sat on top of a hill just below the area leading up to the base of the volcano . parking our rented Toyota , we strolled into the lounge and was greeted by the Manager , Wayne Sheppard . A nice , friendly and open man that anyone would feel at ease with . We checked and stowed our bags in our rooms . Then we were off to explore the lodge . It was built like a hunting lodge , one you might see in the Alaskan wilderness . Large open areas with a great restaurant , bar and game room , which had billiards and table tennis . In the lounge there was a massive fireplace where the guests gathered to chat about their daily hikes up the volcano and to slowly thaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June , which was winter here , and the cold artic wind and desolate appearance only added to the areas mystique . Just another element in creating a good adventure . <p> Our rooms were rustic , well equipped and very comfortable . There was a even a laundry room down the hall . Such a room can be very important to a group of adventurous and soiled travelers . In our behalf , I will say that its hard to be concerned about cleaning your clothes when you 're having this much fun . The lodge was at the end of the only road around for miles and is listed as the highest lodge in New Zealand . The well built lodge stood its ground against the cold , crisp , yet invigorating air that sweep down from the volcano and offered the only sanctuary for miles . <p> While we were there we were informed of a air tour that would fly us over the mountainous area and the volcano itself , giving us a unique filming advantage . The manager , Wayne , called and made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thousands of wild adventures , but like a kid , I always get excited . The rest of the day , we walked and hiked the hills and managed to get to the volcanos summit , but it would not compare with what we were to experience the next day . <p> We were up and ready by early morning for this truly remarkable opportunity and luckily we were fitted with large jackets and gloves , provided by the Skotel Lodge . I thought it was slightly strange to be outfitted in such heavy jackets . Little did we realize just how glad we would be to have these gloves and heavy jackets as we flew over the volcano . And little did we know just beautiful it would be when we captured its vibrant blue and solidly frozen lake resting undisturbed for decades right in the center . <p> We loaded our cameras and headed down the deserted road for about 15 minutes . Following our given directions , we approached the area where the airport was supposed to be , but could n't find it . I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but recognizable , surely .

You receive much better service from people that run their own small businesses . <p> After a moment greetings and some friendly handshakes we were lead out to the field next to the house . The pilot was pushing the small Cessna aircraft out from the shed and onto the runway . Runway ? It was a grass pasture ! But , I loved it ! This was going to be one of those adventures that was n't designed by some profit driven and impersonal corporation that really do n't  show any appreciation to its customers .

The pilot must of read my face and laughing slightly , he stated , " We thought that you might want an unobstructed view , so we took off the door . Are you OK with that ? " No problem , was my macho reply . Hellsbells.He strapped me in and off we went . <p> As we gained altitude the wind became biting and vicious . But no , I would n't of changed places with the President of the USA , not that any sane person would ? .. TO ME , THIS WAS LIVING !

I took more film than I shot while in the Grand Canyon . Now do n't  get me wrongI love the CanyonBut this was so different , so unexpected . After about forty minutes and several passes over the volcano and its mountainous neighbors , we slowly started to drift with the wind back toward the field . But before we did , I spotted , through the sudden cloud break , the most beautiful lake on top of this , ancient volcano . The water was unnaturally blue mixed with turquoise and surrounded with scarlet white snow . Just sitting there in the misty shadows of the clouds , alone , it was mystically inviting and immediately flooded you with unforgettable images .

I had spent a great deal of time as a young man reading about Australia and having lived most of my life in the plains of Texas , felt a connection to the Australian way of life . The outdoors was also a big part of my life and when it came to hunting I was quite comfortable with a rifle.We had been touring all over the Pacific and after spending two months touring from Perth to Sydney , we decided to drive north along the east coast to the city of Brisbane . The mid size city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a few days exploring the area , we took the four and a half hour drive west , anxious to get into the outback . <p> The ever-changing landscape kept me occupied and offered hundreds of photo opportunities .

I had never met him before and thought he was the store clerk when he spoke to me . Only three minutes had passed since I had called him . Very small town ! David was both energetic and calm . Have you ever met a man that you instantly liked ? Luckily , I have met a few , and David was one . I liked him the moment I met him .

Shooting photos in Australia can become quite habit formingbelieve me ! <p> The ranch was owned and operated by Lindsay Noud , a man with calloused hands and a giant heart , who had pretty much built the ranch by himself . There were little unmarked lanes running all through the land , each heading off to a private cabin . I might add that each one was strongly built from native trees found on his own property . The cabin he gave us was huge and surprisingly well furnished . The kitchen had all the fixings for several days of caffeine , coffee and tea .

I am fortunate to have been traveling with my best friend , Dakota , and we would definitely be ready just after dark . Our third comrade , a usually very adventurous young lady , wanted no part in being in the wilderness after dark with three armed men . she was obviously the sane one ! <p> The next day , we had a home-cooked breakfast provided by Lindsay , our host , and then spent the rest of the day hiking along the river .

As we climbed over and around large rocks and in and out of small canyons , we were entertained by enchanting , yet unfamiliar , songs from some Australian birds . Heading back before dark , Lindsay called us to a great supper of steak and vegetables that he prepared himself . Looking at Lindsay with his burly demeanor , one couldnt imagine him with an apron , but there he was what a good fellow ! <p> David arrived right on time to enjoy the meal and after some quiet conversation it was time to pack into his four wheel drive truck and hit the bush . This night we were to hunt kangaroos , which are plentiful and actually so numerous as to become pests at times . The night was filled with anticipation and energy .

Even though I was unfamiliar with most everything in this wild country I felt comfortable in his company .

This night we were to go after wild hogsboars ! Those unpredictable critters with large and dangerous tusksnow.thats hunting ! We drove along some small roads for about an hour and after a few more minutes of plowing through a field of sweet sorghum , we spotted two large hogs . These creatures are extremely intelligent and do n't  just stand around passively while being shot . They scatter , run for miles at a time and at the very least drop to the ground , so as to foil your shot .

From the time we spotted the hogs to the time one lay dead only three minutes had passed . Not a bad start ! With the first hog dead we turned our attentions to the second . David had , by this time , released his two pit bull attack dogs and they were in the hunt . Their deep growling and thrashing could be heard in the near distance . They quickly made the tackle . The dogs were well trained and obedient . It took them less than four minutes to pin down the 240-lb. hog .

A hidden jewel of the sunshine coast , this small town by the shore has a pleasant atmosphere which is enhanced by the friendly and welcoming locals . During our visit to Moffat Beach , we were lucky enough to stay with just such people , Peter and Karen Hebbe . This lovely couple host a beautiful resort called Estoril on Moffat . The Estoril is situated in a quiet cul de sac overlooking the beach and a 10 acre park with native trees and plants . The Estoril houses 18 beautiful self contained apartments , a swimming pool with a spa and waterfall , picnic area , and game room . You may want to spend your entire vacation enjoying this small piece of paradise , but there is a lot more to this small community . <p> Start your day by walking through the 10 acre park , which is directly across the street .

It reminded me of the California coast and of the North beach in Miami Florida . Lots of sunshine , great beaches , palm trees and spectacular scenery . The Gold Coast is on the East coast of Australia and located in New South Wales . Its about five hundred miles north of Sydney . When we drove up the coast from Sydney we were in constant awe of the native wildlife and just the natural beauty of the land . Arriving in the Gold Coast our first agenda was to find a comfortable and affordable hotel . After many hours of searching up and down the coastal area we stopped at the Montego Sands . It was much more than just a hotel , it was an apartment building . Where you can rent a beautiful and well furnished apartment for the same price of a typical hotel room .

While most of the international five-star resorts in Sanya are situated on the picturesque Yalong Bay , the InterContinental is all by itself on the Luhuitou Peninsula , about 15 minutes outside of Sanya City .

It was also the capital city of the Greater Malla Kingdom till the 15th century AD . Many of Bhaktapur 's greatest monuments were built by the then Malla rulers . ( Mike with Holy Men ) <p> ( Below photo ; The Streets of Thamel in central Katmandu ) <p> Below is a list of Temples in and around Bhaktapur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medieval paintings belonging to Hindu and Buddhist schools depicting Tantrism of various periods and descriptions . <p> Nyatapola Temple : This five-storey pagoda was built in 1702 A.D. by King Bhupatindra Malla . It stands on a five-terraced platform . On each of the terraces squat a pair of figures . This is one of the tallest pagodas and is famous for its massive structure and subtle workmanship . ( pic on rt ) <p> Bhairavnath Temple : This temple was first built as a one-storey pagoda but was later changed into a three storey temple in 1718 A.D. by King Bhupatindra Malla . The temple is noted for its artistic grandeur and is dedicated to Lord Bhairav , the god of terror . <p> Dattatraya Temple : Built in 1427 A.D. , this temple is said to have been built from the trunk of a single tree . Nearby is a monastery with exquisitely carved peacock windows . <p> Changu Narayan:The spectacular and ancient temple of Changunarayan sits high on a hill , just 4 kilometers north , and is said to be the oldest existing Pagoda temple in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated at the altitude of about 1700m and is 22 KM east of Katmandu . One of the temples most authentic inscriptions is dated 464 AD . It is accredited to and dedicated to the Lord Vishnu by the Lichhavi King , Mandeva in the Fifth Century . It was listed in the UNESCO World Heritage Monument List in 1979 . <p> More places to visit ; <p> The Bagmati River , near The Teku Temple . While this small temple is somewhat isolated it is still interesting and is nestled on the banks of the country 's most polluted river , the Bagmati . ( Pic . on rt . of river scavengers ) Strolling down the river banks the acidy stench was quite overwhelming , but it was and is not enough to keep the locals from bathing and washing their cloths . While we were there we saw numerous kids and women on the banks and in the water amidst dead animal carcasses and trash thick enough to almost walk on . When will people learn to cherish the waterways and realize that by polluting them they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( below Pic . of kids on the Bagmati River , 04-08-08 ) <p> The Bagmati River was a north-south flowing river , but is now being forced by encroachment to flow east-west . The river , as an object , . is basically a physical feature in the landscape of the Katmandu Valley , and plays a major part in the townscape of Katmandu . In the valley the river is utilized for irrigation and supply of drinking water , but also as a dumping ground for dead animals , as well as a sewer for domestic and industrial waste . In addition Bagmati together with its tributaries is the main source for sand utilized in concrete construction . For the last 40 years the physical condition of the river has gradually changed , becoming more deteriorated in every passing year . The other major dimension is the religious and social importance of the river . The Bagmati River is worshipped by millions of Hindus in Nepal and India . In Hindu cosmos water is a life giving substance , and many devotees conduct daily rituals and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , more precisely , this is what it used to be only 10-15 years ago . ) The contradiction of a holy , ritual pure and a physical dirty river is my thematic starting point . From this basis , how do people still perceive the river holy , as it has become so extremely physically polluted ? What happens to the concept of holiness in a dead river ? And what happens to people 's ritual practices in the river ? <p> Places outside of Kathmandu <h> Royal Chitwan National Park is at the foot of the Himalayas and is one of the few remaining undisturbed vestiges of the Terai region , which formerly extended over the foothills of Nepal . The park is endowed with particularly rich flora and fauna . The local resorts provide guided adventures on the back of elephants and if fortunate one might still view one of the few remaining Bengal Tigers . The park is also home to some of the last populations of single-horned Indian Rhinoceros . ( Rhinoceros unicorn ) Poachers are still a big threat to the few remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reside in the one of Nepal 's easily reachable wild-life reserves . <p> My trip to Katmandu , Nepal was an overwhelming , but disheartening experience and to say the very least , a real disappointment in most categories . Contributing to this was the poor choices of good food and the immense smog causing my energy level to drop rapidly after just a few days in the city . Regardless , there was no way I was going to just hang around the hotel so I pulled myself together and when not touring near and far I wandered aimlessly around the central district of Katmandu , named Thamel . Walking the crowded and narrow nameless streets in a country of gods with thousands of names , while somewhat belittling , added to my exhalations and stimulated my will-power to continue . <p> Along with the inflated prices for tourists , beeping cars and motor bikes , constant power black outs , and the horrific air pollution , the tour was , needless to say , quite challenging . Even under these conditions I proceeded to explore the land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been looking forward to touring Nepal for a long time and though it may not have been exactly what I expected , due mostly to the 24 hour a day smog , I did , however , remain in awe of being in the Himalayan mountain kingdom . Before coming here I had planned on touring Tibet , but due to the riots and Chinese head-cracking , the borders were closed . Another time ... another adventure ! <p> People planning on visiting should be aware of these existing conditions and I highly recommend they have somewhat of an agenda before immersing in the cultural crossroads of a country lost in time . Tours and/or excursions are not easy in Nepal , but can be the experience of a lifetime if mentally and physically prepared . Visiting the world 's mightiest mountain , Mt . Everest , is also quite difficult , as there are no roads or landing zones and requires a 12+ day trek from Katmandu across some of the toughest and roughest terrain on Earth . Come prepared and with the thick smog , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less Mt . Everest . The air does , however , clear the further you get from the cities . <p> General Information <p> Lodging <p> Lodging is plentiful and fairly inexpensive throughout the country , but if you want any comfort , such as a decent room , air-con and an elevator , be prepared to pay a very inflated price . Both Katmandu and Pokhara have numerous shady to basic hostels ranging from just 300 Rupees , $5 US dollars , and up . The decent to good hotels range from 2500 up to 12,000+ Rupees , per night . The April 2008 exchange was about 62 Rupees per US dollar . Sadly , most hotels , etc. are not listed on the web and have to be booked upon arrival , but you can find some listed hostels and a few at a reasonable price on www.hostelworld.com , which is an affiliate of our company , Travelers Digest . When checking into any hostel or hotel be sure to ask for several candles from the desk , as due to the long blackouts ... you will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling a multitude of mostly non edibles , as well as small cafes and larger restaurants in Katmandu , and in most other cities , and in general are quite cheap . Keep in mind that this is not Europe or the USA and there are no health guidelines relating to the slaughter , transportation and care of meat products , so I personally recommend eating fresh vegetables and pastas . We witness the callousness in which the animals were treated and butchered on filthy concrete and even dirt floors , so I suggest being a strict vegetarian while traveling in this part of the world . Fruits , pastas , eggs and toast were my main daily diet . <p> CRIME <p> Previous to April 10th , 2008 , election , when the Maoist were swept into power , there were almost daily incidences of Maoist extortions of money from trekkers and climbers , occurring on all main trekking routes . There were reports that tourists had faced demands for " so called taxes " upwards of thousands of Nepalese rupees . Although there is no evidence that violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ruled out if trekkers declined to pay . <p> There have also been reports of trekkers being robbed where violence or the direct threat of violence had been used . These incidents were not necessarily thought to have been carried out by Maoists , but perhaps by others using the deteriorating security situation to their own ends . Nonetheless , you should be aware of the real risk of robbery . I also recommend not walking the darken streets of Katmandu late at night and to always remain alert . Never carry your passport , only a copy , and definitely never more cash than you immediately require . Dress down , Nepal is not a formal country . <p> If trekking , you are strongly advised to remain on established routes , and to walk in groups with reputable trekking agencies . I also strongly recommend that you do not trek alone and avoid becoming separated from your group . When shopping expect the highest prices , but never pay more than you feel its worth ... <h> LOCAL TRAVEL <p> Countrywide strikes ( bandhs ) had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Maoists , and had resulted in widespread disruption , including transport . Bandhs were major disruptions to all walks of life in Nepal ( including local transport , road travel , shops etc ) and can be violent . Prior to the election tourists had been temporarily stranded , but things will hopefully improve . <p> Traffic in Katmandu normally flows well though there are sometimes major jams during rush-hour in the city . Access to the valley from the Pokhara direction has improved with the widening of the road at the major checkpoint entering Katmandu , but all of the country 's roads are narrow , winding and extremely hazardous . Every car , truck , motor cycle , bike , bus , vendor cart and buffalo are in a constant battle for passage resulting in most awkward conditions , as well as many daily fatalities . It is quite common to learn of a bus going off the highways into the rivers and deep canyons and needless to say ... with no survivors . I witnessed 3 such wrecks on my one day trip to Pokhara . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAFETY <p> Road travel in general carries risk . Traffic in Nepal drives on the left , as in the UK . The general standard of driving throughout the country is poor and badly regulated , if at all . Roads in Katmandu are very congested and most drivers are not properly licensed , trained or insured and vehicles are poorly maintained . There are few pavements outside central Katmandu and motorists do not yield right of way to pedestrians or anything ... except livestock . <p> Nepalese roads are like American Ford cars ... Fix Or Repair Daily ! <p> Bus travel is particularly hazardous and multiple-fatality accidents are common . You should avoid travel on overnight buses . Unless suicidal , I really do n't suggest renting or driving a car , bike or motorbike anywhere in the country . <p> Road conditions are generally poor and difficult even in the best of conditions . During the monsoon season ( June to September ) many roads outside the Katmandu valley are prone to landslides and become impassable . Always expect ... the unexpected . <p> While riding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads on our way to Pokhara we were stranded behind a kilometer long line of vehicles for hours . I grabbed my Nikon camera and proceeded to the front of the line and tried blending in with hundreds of people hanging on the side of the road all starring down at the river . There was a huge crane directly in the middle of the road and some police , as well as soldiers in the midst of trying to hook a truck that had rolled down the steep rocky embankment into the raging river . As that there are many people in Nepal that can speak English I was told that a white open back truck with 2 men were in the river and due to the lengthy period of time ... were most likely , if not certainly ... dead . That , unfortunately ... was the case . <p> Smog , trash and general pollution <p> Nepal in general is highly polluted in most cities and even small valley towns where the air is consistently filled with heavy smoke due to the local burning of farm land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers are filthy with bodies of animals , millions of tons of debris and sewer waste , but still the local adults and children drank , swim and bath in the diseased waters . Personally , I highly suggest not to drink or even brush your teeth in the tap water . During my stay I was constantly congested with a bad cough , stomach problems and a general lack of energy from the food and air pollution . <p> I might add that air and water pollution are nothing uncommon in most of Asia , including the major cities of India , Thailand , Myanmar , Cambodia , Laos , Malaysia , as well as the mega cities of Hong Kong and Singapore . China is definitely not excluded , as it is horrifically polluted . While I adore Asia , I am quite displeased with their government 's lack of control and their peoples lack of concern . Sadly , pollution generated here or there ends up everywhere . <p> Power Black Outs <p> As of the end of April 2008 there were daily power outages lasting several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average of 12 to 16 hours without electricity . After some research I discovered that there was no real issue with production , as they have many river driven power stations ... the real problem is their selling of power to neighboring India , and for much less that the Nepalese pay . Applying even a minimum of logic it seems quite puzzling why they would shut off the power to their own industry , stores , cafes and hotels , as well as to their own people to power to India ? It is much more than just an inconvenience and contributes to lack of growth , to crime and is especially detrimental to their tourism industry . During our extensive Nepal tour we traveled by car , plane and foot , as well as hiked , trekked and even flew over the Himalayans to view Mt . Everest . We were quite dishearten and aggravated when we could n't see the much glorified mountains , or much of anything , due to the thick smoke . I must reiterate that in regard to the power blackouts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very hot by June , continuing to the end of September , and paying more , a lot more , for an air conditioned hotel room , really is n't helpful without electricity . I , personally condemn the country 's politicians and hope that with their newly elected Maoist Party the blackouts , as well as the suffering of the Nepalese with end , but I really doubt it . <p> Looking back , as it is now in late Jan. 2009 , the problems in Nepal have not gotten better , but are getting worst with all the political infighting , riots , police brutality and general chaos . <p> Visas : A passport and visa are required . Tourists may purchase two-month , single-entry visas or two-month , multiple-entry visas upon arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport in Katmandu and at the following certain land border points of entry . Tourists may stay in Nepal no longer than 150 days in any given calendar year . <p> Health &amp; other risks : Travelers should be aware of the immense air and water pollution and the random chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one should not depend on emergency services such as evacuations and rescues by helicopter for illness or injuries . When dining we suggest staying away from most meat products . Nepal just held it 's 1st ever election on April 10th , 2008 , putting the Maoist Party into power . The country is going through many transitions , with daily demonstrations , etc . The Maoist and their YCL ( Young Communist League ) are showing their true nature with nationwide intimidation , beatings , kidnappings , land grabs and even murder . Nepal is not a safe country for locals or visitors .

I was quite tired of traveling alone so I partnered with an intelligent young Filipino lady . Together we obtained our 3 month Visas for China and on the 14th of May 2007 we boarded the China-Air flight to Beijing for what was to be just one more of my many experiences that developed into an adventure of a life-time for us both . <p> During the first week of our arrival , Dakota , my partner , in hearing of our new tour flew in from Hong Kong and the three of us delved deep into this land of mystery and ancient Chinese culture . <p> Beijing , China <p> Arriving mid-day on the 14th we were met by a pre-arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city to a most interesting mountain ranch .

It had been his favorite hunting grounds and was nestled in the rocky hills near a section of the Great Wall . It was the perfect hideaway and was watered by a small stream . The locals had damned a section and raised fish , which I can assure you were delicious . Our private stone cabin was rustic and while authentic was quite comfortable . The dining prepared by the Tibetan staff was superb . We spent 5 glorious days at the ranch and went on several tours and long walks . We also relished it 's tranquility and left with a tidbit of Chinese history . <p> The Red Capital Ranch Information <p> Imagine a small ranch in Manchuria , next to the Great Wall and you 're are the Red Capital Ranch , first and unique ecologist hotel in Beijing . set on a private estate of 50 Chinese acres offering 360 degree vista views of the Great Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury Chinese villas tucked along the foot of a mountain . <p> The Red Capital Ranch is located in a private valley surrounded by mountains , with rivers weaving through the estate .

It would definitely take a lot more than getting the people to stop their continuous spitting on the sidewalks and teaching a few words of English to their taxi drivers .

@@48313581 @1813581/ <p> After our long and totally adventurous journey around most of the planet and after only 6 months back in the States , we were off again . After spending 6 weeks visiting our family in sunny California and a 3-month break in Austin , Texas , we traveled to Florida . Spending some time in numerous Fl. beach cities we eventually made it to Miami , the Latin hub of the Americas . Our first journey from there was the Caribbean Isle of Puerto Rico . The little I knew about the Island was learned from previous friendships , brochures and passed on information from business &amp; personal contacts . Was it to be everything I had anticipated ? With my favorite &amp; crucial , brainy traveling partner and Dakota , we would soon know if it was worth the journey . <p> In the weeks before our short flight in early March 2005 we had contacted several tourism related businesses seeking their participation in our promotional tour . Their response was welcoming .

Unlimited mileage was also important , as we intended to explore every inch of this Caribbean Isle. - <p> Arriving at the international airport in the capital city , San Juan , we met up with our prearranged guide , Mr. Hector Reyes , a 25-year-old native . Catching the airport shuttle bus for the short ride to Charlies to pick up our Van , we quickly became acquainted . After a brief meeting and a quickly signed agreement we were handed the keys to a new Ford mini-vanit was just that easy .

But , as our usual luck , we arrived on the island in the middle of some local festivities and as it was getting late in the day we decided to stay the night just outside the city center . We had initially planned to drive across the island to our booked accommodations . Everyone else on the island must have shared our decision , as there was not a room or even a barn for sleeping available anywhere . Hector , being the true gent he was , invited us to meet his Mom , step dad and his lil brothers . They lived in a quaint , but well kept house on a hill in the outskirts of San Juan . What a greeting !

Great , was my quick reply , but my quick acceptance turned into folly as we soon learned the hotel was a brothelwith a bedazzled glance toward Dakota and a deep sigh , we accepted our fate'oh well , was all I could muster .

It was a very unique experience , but some-what humbling , as I heard the cars coming &amp; going along with the multitude of neighboring grunts and moans into the wee-dawn hours of the morning .

To most it 's a big world ... too me it 's a small world , but always amazing , especially in the SE of Asia . It 's a world in a world and offers the best of mankind and the absolute best of nature . My journey into the communist capital of Vietnam , Hanoi was long in coming as I had occupied three months of 2006 and the first two months of 2007 touring extensively in the stunning and unforgettable country of Thailand ... from the Malaysian border in the south to the tri river delta in the far north , called the Golden Triangle . <p> Before heading into Vietnam , as I was saving it for last , so I could have more time in exploring what was soon to become one of my most favored nations , I toured the ancient and poor , but phenomenal , country of Cambodia and onward to Laos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time ... to when people actually enjoyed each other and worked as a community for the welfare of all .

As my generation had partaken in the madness of the war I was quite familiar with the tales and horror stories , especially of the infamous Hanoi Hilton where American POWS had been supposedly kept and tortured . Was it still there , was the one question that drove me to research the hotel and as if time had stood still ... it was still a hotel . Remodeled , of course , but just the image buried so deep in my mind drove me to seek it out and book my week long stay at this hotel turned prison and then back to hotel .

So , after breezing though immigration and grabbing my numerous bags I headed just outside the main terminal door and squatted for a smoke . The air was heavy and fairly humid and echoed the many sounds of busy travelers humming inaudible sounds in a multitude of languages . My first smoke in a few hours gave me a slight buzz and as usual I drifted ... drifted back in my mind to my life and what had led up to my fabulous career .

Ahhh , life was good and as I eventually found , or more correctly ... stumbled , my way to adulthood I learned that the main purpose of life was life itself ... living every moment as if it was your last and never ... never ... hanging onto anything too long . I still adhere to those simple philosophies and Vietnam would just be another side-trip in my never-ending journeys , but one I would not soon forget ! <p> My Canadian buddies arrived on scheduled and after some howdies and hugs we headed off in a taxi to the Hanoi Hilton , as I had reserved 2 rooms .

Vietnam was and is a country on the move . <p> While walking around the city center in the midst of the local people I could n't help but feel somewhat timid in my awareness that I was an American . How would I be treated ? Were the people still harboring much deserved hatred towards the citizens of the country that bombed , killed and raped their people for so many years ? My fears soon diminished as everyone I made eye contact with smiled and were genuine in their welcoming behavior , as they went on with their daily lives .

With my new buddies we were like a trio of kids and wandered both day and night in and around this action packed city of millions , including a a few million motorbikes zinging and zagging in every free space or road and sidewalk . Walking without getting ran over was a major challenge ... driving would be suicidal .

@@48313583 @1813583/ <p> Prelude and introduction ; My name is Michael Smith , the travel editor of Travelers Digest . My job , as well as goal , is to tour the best and , at times , the worst of the world in letting our readers know before they go . <p> I had pretty much been touring with Dakota , my partner and side-kick , since 1997 , but when beginning my SE . Asian tours I was to be alone . He was assigned to tour The UK , Spain , Portugal , Morocco and Egypt and I was to go into SE Asia . After departing and leaving the amazingly exciting city of Hong Kong in Oct. 2006 I wandered throughout SE Asia for a couple of months . I enjoyed my wild adventures immensely , but having been in and out of Thailand several times , during a 4 year period , I worked my way back into the country , where I lingered for a couple of months in a very nice and affordable 1 bedroom , fully furnished condo in Chiang Mai . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is Thailand 's most westernized . <p> During this stay in Chiang Mai , Thailand , nigh to Christmas 2006 , the lack of non-celebratory awareness in the region somewhat dulled my holiday spirit . In this regard I was quite content just mingling with the gracious and gentle people of this accommodating and charming city . I had grown to adore the laidback lifestyle and the friendliness of the Thai people and soon became thoroughly relaxed and quite honestly ... very lazy . I spent my time at a favored open-street cafe , riding my rental scooter and occasional hours at a small blues bar , but mostly just watching my cabled big screen TV and catching up on my writing . <p> By the time Jan. 2007 came around Dakota was back in Hong Kong and I was anxious to get back with him and do another tour . We decided on touring Cambodia , so I met up with him on the 8th of Feb. 2007 in Bangkok . Hopping on an overnight train from Chiang Mai I covered the barely 700 kilometers in just under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was entertaining . I spent most of my time in the decrepit lounge car chatting , laughing and dancing with a mixed group of Polish people celebrating someone 's wedding . <p> I checked in a small hotel in Bangkok , grabbed a few hours sleep and awoke to a peck on the door around 2 ; AM the next morning . It was Dakota and after some hugs , we both slept for 4 hours and at the morning 's daybreak we grabbed a taxi and headed off for the Cambodian border . The fare ended up reasonable , after some hearty bargaining , as the driver had started at 100 US and we finalized the deal around 60 US . The drive took about 5 hours , where after clearing the border customs , we would grab a local cab for the additional 5 hour drive down the worst road imaginable , to the much written about city of Siem Reap ... home of the remarkable Angkor Wat Temples . <p> Tired , bruised and covered in thick red dirt from the unpaved road we checked into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some luxury , but as that the hotel was an affiliate , the stay was free and that 's always a deal maker . A long shower , some chow at their restaurant and early to bed would hopefully refresh us for a long day of touring this economically poor , but culturally rich region . Cambodia in its entirety was built and forged by the power of its religion and pushed by its cruel and self serving kings . In their Kings defense , if any , they did manage to carve out some amazing architecture in the heart of some of the regions most dense jungles ... a religious history that is still persuasive even today . <p> In conclusion , I must iterate how stunning the region is and especially the many jungle temples still standing against several wars , looters , countless rulers , demonically corrupt dictators and through centuries of disarray ... and through it all ... they still bear the glory that was Cambodia . Like the Persians , the Egyptians , The Greeks and the Central American Mayan &amp; Aztecs , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are obvious today in weather prediction , calendars &amp; time keeping , lunar farming , medicine , science , metallurgy and stone architecture and so much more . They , like all such people , were the foundation layers of our modern world . I salute their fortitude and diligence , as well as their suffering ! ! ! <p> After 6 days of obsessive touring and exploration of everything we could discover , with the help of the locals , we left the city with years of memories and a changed philosophy . Leaving we again hopped a taxi for the long ride south to Phnom Phen , the capital . Even though the road was pretty good and at least paved ... the 8 1/2 hour trip was also very tiring , but this time we did not have an affiliate hotel to stay in ... so after some strolling around the river area we bedded down in a small and quite reasonably priced hotel . We only stayed about 4 days in Phenom Phen and I was , as I am in most large cities , totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's highlights for sure , especially the boat trip down the Mekong River . The poverty , the beggars , the precious dirty faced children , the crippled and the stench of a large city embellished with decay ... left me with a heavy heart . <p> After the Cambodia tour Dakota and I flew into the capital of another country shrouded in myth and mystery ... Laos . Arriving in Vientiane , the capital of Laos , around midday on the 18th of Feb. 2006 , we hopped a cab into the city center . This city , while large , seemed like a ghost town ... streets dirty , mostly unpaved , sewer running down the streets and a feel of hapless desperation . Within 20 minutes I was looking forward to our next flight ... to the northern city of Luang Prabang . After 2 boring as hell days of wandering the old tired city and 2 nights of pitiful smoldering sleep in a dingy , but cheap , hotel we flew off to Luang Prabang for what turned out to be a great adventure in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that ended way too soon , as Dakota had to fly back to Hong Kong near the end of Feb. 2006 . Not wanting to leave so soon I stayed another week after he left and increased my adrenalin pumping experiences to yet a higher level . This region of Laos is a great place of striking heritage , ancient culture , super accommodating people and extensive adventures for everyone ! <p> I left Laos on the 1st of March , 2007 and headed into of one of the world 's most inspirationally stunning countries , Vietnam , for a 2 month tour . Flying into the capital , Hanoi I checked into another of our affiliate hotels ... The Hanoi Hilton , made famous during the Vietnam War , as a POW Prison . It 's , of course , not the same buildings , as its now a mega million dollar luxury hotel . After a somewhat stressful 4 day tour of this mega city of millions I hopped a taxi for the 5 hour ride to Ha Long Bay , with its countless alien limestone islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite an enjoyable and visually stimulating 6 day tour . Bidding the many newly made friends farewell I then boarded a train southward ; stopping a few days in several stunning cities along the coast ; such as ; Hue City , Da Nang , Hoi An and the gorgeous beach city of Nha Trang . I then proceeded to ride the rail south down to the city of Hoi Chi Min , formally Saigon ; the center of the American occupation in the Vietnam war ... which is another story . <p> After touring Cambodia and Laos with Dakota and nearing the end of my lone tour of Vietnam , where I had been staying in a nice centralized Saigon Hotel for $18 US a day , I began planning yet another tour . Frankly , I was tired of traveling alone so I partnered with an intelligent young Filipino woman I had met during her vacation in Saigon . She was anxious to get out and explore the world , so together we obtained our 3 month Visas for China . On the 14th of May 2007 we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be just one of many intriguing experiences that developed into a long adventure for us both . <p> During the first week of our Beijing arrival , Dakota , hearing of our new tour , flew in from Hong Kong and the three of us delved deep into this ancient and awe-inspiring land of ancient mystery ... China . Before arriving we had been invited , and gladly accepted a 5 day stay , with all meals , at a very old mountain ranch , called The Capital Ranch . About a 3 hour drive from Beijing it sits deep in the mountains near a section of the Great Wall . It had been built by one of China 's Kings , as it was his favorite hunting grounds . After this immensely relaxing and historical stay on the Ranch we were driven back to the city , where we checked into a central hotel . As we both love simple food and are vegetarians choice dining was fairly difficult and we eat mostly veggies and biscuits at one of the many Beijing KFC , which is the American chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Wall , Forbidden City and countless ancient sites and temples and quickly realized that we would have needed a lifetime to explore the region just around Beijing . <p> The world 's a large place and being this close to Japan was enticing , so Dakota and I flew to Osaka Japan for a few days and then hopped on the magic Bullet Train and sped to Tokyo at over 340 kilometers an hour , nearly 180 MPH . Everyone coming to Japan absolutely must ride the unforgettable Bullet Train from Osaka to Tokyo ... an amazing ride ! We covered the mega city of Tokyo , mostly by foot , for 10 days and were not impressed , as it is mostly a cultureless city of partying and shopping with exorbitant costs on everything . <p> Leaving we boarded a plane to Taipei , Taiwan for a mad dash 2 week tour . As in Tokyo I was n't impressed in the slightest by Taipei , as it was actually falling apart from neglect , as was the country in it 's entirety . We did manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the east coast to a most entertaining city , Hualien ; where we stayed at another of our affiliates , The Azure Hotel ... for free . <p> Sheila , my female companion , had n't joined us on this tour and had instead went to Macau to visit some friends . Macau is a small gaming island just a couple of hours via a high-speed ferry from Hong Kong and is a favorite of the mainland Chinese ... as they do love their gambling ! ! ! <p> Japan &amp; Taiwan Reviews Coming Soon ! ! ! <p> After our tour of Japan and Taiwan Sheila and I were reunited in Macau , where we stayed a few days before going back into China to Zhuhai . We have since made the circuit ; Shenzhen , China and across the border back to Hong Kong for 6 weeks , then back to Saigon , another tour of Cambodia , another taxi ride to Bangkok on the 3rd of Oct , 2006 , staying at the phenomenal Sky Bioke 80 story Hotel . Three days later we were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my favorite cities ... Chiang Mai , Thailand . We ended up staying for nearly five months . <p> On the of 7th of Jan 2008 Dakota flew over from Hong Kong and stayed at our very nice condo for almost a month . During his stay the three of us rented a small car for the 7 hour drive into the history laden Golden Triangle region where we crossed into Myanmar . A country where the friendly and welcoming people are and have been brutally suppressed for decades by a Military Junta , of the same merit as the murderous *Pol Pot , iron ruler of the *Khmer Rouge . Another region where the world has turned a blind eye . We did n't stay over the one day in the border town of Mae-Sai and left before dark . In that short time I was appalled and sicken at what I saw and felt when mingling with the long faced and heart-broken people . The streets , while busy , seemed empty of spirit and laughter . There were no children playing , no greetings and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 devastating cyclone the country is now pretty much thrown back into the stone-age . And again their corrupt and power greedy Military Junta have shown total lack of concern for their own people , as they hijack foreign shipments of food , water and supplies and then , in total mockery , paste their own faces on the boxes before handing out the few they do manage to distribute . This may fool the locals , but has angered the world in general and the USA is now harboring a plan of intervention ... military style . Perhaps they should , I mean after all if the USA can pretty much wipe out Iraq and Afghanistan on a whim ... why not do something right ? ? ? <p> We then flew over and spent 2 weeks in Singapore and then back to Chiang Mai to pack up to leave the area for good . We flew to Hong Kong and spent a week to get Visas for our continued tours of China and Nepal . Along with Dakota and his new partner the 4 of us left Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China ... the industrial might of China ... which was obvious as it was bathed in choking smog .

Its the home of the worlds mightiest mountains , including Mount Everest . After 15 days of amazing tours , flights over Mt . Everest , animal sacrificial rituals , human cremations on the Pashupati River and so much more we left to explore more of this stunning mystery country . Leaving Kathmandu on the 12th of April in a taxi we rode 7 hours through the mountains to a lot less traumatic and charming lake side city of ... Pokhara . We loved it so much we stayed 5 weeks in a most darling lakeside hotel named Hotel Crown . Believe me for 10 US dollars a day ... it is an excellent choice . With its great food , superb hosts , large modern rooms , cable TV , ceiling fans and large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for sure . <p> In late May , 2008 we would cross the border for a long and extensive tour of India ... and did n't want to miss a thing .

@@48313585 @1813585/ <p> After over two weeks of treks , tours and mind boggling experiences , while trying my best to absorb the diverse and intense culture changes of Katmandu , it was time to continue my travel across the country and eventually into Northern India . In preparation for my trip to India I had to first get my Visa . As I soon learned ... this was not to be an easy task even though it should have been routine , as in most countries . Here , it seemed that easy was a word seldom heard or used ! After five days and countless hours of waiting in lines of nearly a hundred people I eventually got my Visa . My next stop would be the city of Pokhara , Nepal . <p> When leaving the intriguing city of Katmandu on the 12th of April I knew I would n't ride a bus across the mountains , especially after hearing of so many crashes . With that in mind I hired a taxi and headed across the mountains to a most written about city in a stunning valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or about $65 US . The drive should have taken about 5 hours , but like most experiences in this region of the world ... it took a lot longer . After about 3 hours of driving through the windy and poorly maintained roads we were stranded behind a kilometer long line of vehicles , which lasted for hours . Wanting to discover why ; I grabbed my Nikon camera and proceeded to the front of the line trying to get through the hundreds of people hanging on the side of the road starring down at the river . At the front of the stopped traffic there was a huge crane directly in the middle of the road along with some police , as well as soldiers in the midst of trying to hook a truck that had rolled down the steep rocky embankment into the torrent river . Many people in Nepal can speak English and upon asking I was told that a white midsized truck with 2 men were in the river and due to the lengthy period of time ... were most likely , if not certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While in Katmandu in April 2008 there were daily power outages lasting several hours at a time and on most days there were 8 to 12 hours without electricity . After some research I discovered that there was no real issue with production , as they have many river driven power stations ... actually their real problem was the selling of power to neighboring India , and for much less than to their own people . I soon learned after reaching Pokhara that the blackouts were not limited to just Katmandu ... they were nationwide . I will never understand why nations sell their resources while creating shortages , as well as hardships , for their own people ! <p> We had made arrangements to stay in the Crown Hotel and was pleasantly surprised when eventually pulling up in the front of the hotel . It was a 3 story quaint stone building , with lots of large open windows , and set back from the end of the main lakeside road running along the stunning Phewa Lake . In front was a grass , shrub and flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a small garden planted with corn , all combining to create a most serene atmosphere . Looking around at the non-hurried road lined with small shops and cafes , while breathing the cool clean air , and knowing I would be staying in this family ran hotel for under $10 US , ( 600 Rupees ) my spirits was definitely elevating . Even though the city of Pokhara , itself , had over 200,000 people , the area known as lakeside seemed totally separate and somewhat isolated , adding to its appeal . <p> ( Above pic . of Pokhara , Nepal ) <p> I ended up staying in this hotel for over 4 weeks and , while bonding with the owners family , enjoyed tranquility , adventure , excellent dining , warm days , cool nights and all in a natures paradise . I went on treks , rowed boats on the stunning Phewa Lake and even rode a rental motor scooter on an 8 hour trail busting adventure along the river .

These mountain people have no real conveniences , but seemed at peace with themselves in finding solace in their centuries old ways of life and in their Hindu faith . The rewarding mountain scooter trek , while exhilarating was exhausting and after about 3 hours into the ride I parked for an hour and fell asleep on a grassy hill over-looking the river . I awoke to a small boy staring down at me from the top of an old stone wall . <p> ( Above pic . of Lake Phewa ) <p> I spent a lot of time hanging around the strip of Pokhara 's rightfully named Lakeside area and seldom ventured into the main city area away from the lake .

Most of my time was enjoying late afternoon walks along the lakeshore , rowing a canoe in the calm , clean waters of the lake and quiet candlelit dinners at one of the open air cafes on it 's shore . The dining in Pokhara is far better than in Kathmandu and the lake fish , as well as the water buffalo cheese pizza and enchiladas are excellent choices . The best place for dining was at the Be Happy Restaurant , down just a few meters , on the left , from the Hotel Crown . <p> Being totally submersed in the solitude I did , however , manage to occasionally pull myself away from the lakeside tranquility and after about a week of being just totally lazy I trekked to the top of a small mountain just outside of town , called , Sarangkot . On the top there is a small temple where the exposed snow capped peaks of The Annapurna come into clear view . It was then that I realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the cities with there bustle and pollution , it was the people and even more ... it was the majestic mountains of the Himalayas . The below picture was taken from another mountain top temple , Peace Stupa . <p> ( Below Pic ; The Annapurna 's &amp; Lake Phewa ) <p> A trip to Nepal , both Katmandu and Pokhara , as well as journeys into the Himalayans , is a mind opening and heartfelt experience that is definitely a must-do before you die . But please leave your preconceptions and attitude at home , especially you westerners ... Nepal is not one of your colonies so show respect and gratitude for their graciousness , accommodation and servitude . <p> Even with the high poverty , polluted air and water , lack of consistent electric power , along with no real medical care I do hope that with their newly elected Maoist 's officials in power that the Himalayan people of Nepal will be able to achieve must deserved economical growth and lasting stability . I also hope the Chinese will find a peaceful solution to the Tibet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Summary ; We eventually pried ourselves away from the beauty and tranquility of this time forgotten city and on the morning of July 11th , 2008 we took a taxi to the Indian border . Little did we know that it would be quite an adventure just reaching the border . <p> A wild ride to the Indian border ; The taxi driver we had hired , while quite reasonably priced at 6000 Nepalese Rupees , $100 USD , he was a very reckless driver and to put it mildly , scared the hell out us every few minutes of sliding around countless curves on steep mountain passes ; easily 3000 feet high . It had started raining by the time we had left the Pokhara valley and entered the stunning , but nearly impassable roads winding through the western Himalayas . Sheila , my partner , usually a very tough woman became sick and the driver had to stop a few times so she could vomit . After an hour of this maniacal race I grabbed the driver and told him ever so firmly to slow down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it myself . He finally got the message and the rest of our 6 hour drive was fairly decent and I even managed to snap a few photos . <p> We were to be driven to a small town just a few kilometers from the Indian border and wanted to definitely get settled into a hotel there before dark , but we were to be delayed . About two hours before reaching our destined town of Sunauli we were forced to stop . A group of the YCL , ( youth communist league ) had piled up rubbish and lit it a blaze , as well as having thrown up a road block of rocks . The group of men and boys ages from 12 to 30 stood right in the middle of the road , leaving no way around . <p> The Communist Party had won the main elections on the 10th of April and with their new empowerment were taking control of pretty much everything in Nepal ... the transportation , the markets , farmland and especially the roads . It seemed that to exercise their new power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare a strike ... which was more of a strike against others , such as bus and taxis drivers . This completely stopped all movement of people and goods , thus paralyzing the entire country . <p> After telling the reluctant driver to pull up to the road block and argue us through , we proceeded , but was stopped and our car was immediately surrounded by these loud and obnoxious men all screaming at the shy and scared driver . At first most of their attention was directed at him in questioning why he would even consider on driving through their road block . After a couple of minutes , more and more of these scantily clad youths started gathering around the rear of the cab where we were sitting . I told Sheila to roll up her window , as all of our doors were already locked . Before she could get the window all the way up 3 youths reached in her window and their protruding weight kept her from manually rolling it up . This , while not surprising , was just enough to set me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f##king hands away from her . They were all carrying long bamboo poles and had been whacking the hood and top of the cab and when I yelled they all packed around our two rear windows , in which mine was completely down as a demonstration that I was not going to be intimidated . <p> After several tense moments the driver succumbed to their demands to turn the cab around and as he was relieved after this brutal display we sped back the way we came . As that we had paid him to take us to the border town ... this was not acceptable , so I told him to find another way . He was afraid , but also knew I would not relent , so we wandered around for an hour going down old dirt cow trails until we found our way back to the main highway beyond where the roadblock had been . Two hours later we rolled into Sunauli ; a small one main road town of hustlers . The towns people knew anyone coming there were heading across the border and thus each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the last dollar from travelers before they ventured into India . ( Below ; Sunauli , border town ) <p> Chatting with the first dozen or so men that gathered around the taxi , even before we could get our bags ... we were , thankfully , directed to a decent hotel , the Mansamrover , for 1000 India Rupees , about 24 USD a night . The small , but overly crowded town was the main stopover before the border and mostly any local money to be made was from foreigners and like mosquitoes they were watchful when we stepped out to find a bite to eat . As usual in this part of the world ... the only safe and editable food was eggs and toast , so with that said ... we ate and wandered slowly back to the hotel and crawled into the rock hard beds to slumber our way to morning . For all you travelers disliking eggs and toast ... bring your own food or suffer the consequences , as there are no regulations on food hygiene . There are also no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafes , etc. from selling rotten , spoilt or even road-kill , and we 're not talking about deer . <p> Hopping a Rickshaw , an open bike taxi , early the next morning , we mingled with the thousands of trucks , honking buses , countless street urchins , hustlers and peddlers and wiggled our way the 4 kilometers to the massively congested and totally chaotic border crossing . In the back of my mind I had been hoping that the border town with its immense Indian populace was not the norm for India , but as we reached the border I realized that the town we left was probably tame compared to the cities we were to tour in India ... a billion and 147 million people ... my God , what a scary thought ! ! ! Riding a train in India is even a more scary thought ! ! ! <p> Visas : A passport and visa are required . Tourists may purchase two-month , single-entry visas or two-month , multiple-entry visas upon arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu and at the following certain land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer than 150 days in any given calendar year . <p> Health &amp; other risks : Travelers should be aware of the immense air and water pollution and the random chance of robbery . Trekking in remote areas can be very hazardous and one should not depend on emergency services such as evacuations and rescues by helicopter for illness or injuries . When dining we suggest staying away from most meat products . Nepal just held it 's 1st ever election on April 10th , 2008 , putting the Maoist Party into power . The country is going through many transitions , with daily demonstrations , etc . The Maoist and their YCL ( Young Communist League ) are showing their true nature with nationwide intimidation , beatings , kidnappings , land grabs and even murder . Nepal is not a safe country for locals or visitors .

@@48313587 @1813587/ <p> Before arriving in Rio , we spent ten days in the mega city of Sao Paulo , the second largest city in the world and while it may have the reputation of being the business capital of Latin America ... it was not a city for the beach and party crowd . The nearest beach was a four hour bus ride ... which is exactly where we headed as soon as we finished our five tour of the city and our sponsoring company ... The Hilton Hotel . Boarding the bus for the coast we left the sprawling city of a thousand skyscrapers and large derelict slums , they slowly , but eventually disappeared behind us in the drizzling rain . An hour outside the city the sorrowful poverty and degenerate landscapes gave way to serene valleys , over-lapping mountains , flowing rivers and dense rain forests ... The real beauty of Brazil was before us at last . The rain was steady as the bus made its twisting turns through the hills and staggering mountains . The fairly new bus gave a good and comfortable ride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature . The land stretched on and on and in its pure raw form it was obvious that nature bestowed her adoration in the flowing steep mountains that ever so gingerly gave birth to the turquoise waters of the south Atlantic . <p> The four hour ride left us at the dock just outside the quaint town of Sao Sebastiao where we were to board a ferry for the twenty minute journey through the unsettled waves between the coast and the Isle of Ilhabela . The flat ferry also acted as a car carrier and as it sat ever so low in the water , with the extra weight , the mild storm lifted the waves to cover the deck with ankle deep water . The water was warm and welcoming as I slipped off my Russian sandals . My camera was fluent in its goal as we worked jointly to capture the idyllic blending of white capped water , ghostly mountains cast in twilight 's shadows and the faint lights glistening from the coastal beaches on the not so distant island of our destination . Peace settled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocking of the ferry and the scant chatter of the locals harmonized in my mind . <p> As the boat docked and the people came back to life , we grabbed our bags and fell into line . As we departed the boat we walked up the dock and the few meters to a waiting taxi . The driver was laying across the front seat with his feet protruding from the window . It was the perfect setting for a tropical paradise and a good example of how life should be lived ... in harmony . Awakening from his deep slumber it was apparent that most locals could n't afford a taxi and his entire existence was dependent on the few tourists that managed to discover this out of the way little piece of paradise . As he looked up I spoke the only words needed ... Por Favor villa ! We were loaded in a minute and we raced off along the cobblestone lanes that ran parallel to the sand and tree covered coast . Fifteen minutes and ten Brazilian Reals , about three US dollars , later we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverse definitely had a re-pore with the villa as this was his one and only choice of Villas . The older gentleman at the desk spoke some English , and as that he was the owner , he gave us a good price on a large room . The surf and sand lay only twenty meters away across the narrow road and the next morning , we discovered within a few blocks some good cafes , grocery stores and in the village , by bus , we even found an internet cafe . But these discoveries were to come later ... after unpacking , it was time for some food . Just across the street we located a small bar and was prepared to forget about food and just drown down a few drinks before turning in , but as we discovered , the bar did offer food and it was quite good . They had sat up the kitchen on the other side of the road as the beach area was small and the locals mostly came to drink and socialize . We ordered and settled down with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surf . With our cold drink in hand we waited for what was to be some delicious dining . <p> After what we had hoped to be a good night sleep in the comfortable villa with no screens or air conditioning , we soon discovered after waging constant war will millions of starving mosquitoes set on feasting on our bodies ... that the morning was to be a distant realization . By 6:AM the ungodly traffic began roaring louder than the swarming hordes of blood sucking mosquitoes . I was also evident that mufflers were a scarce commodity on the island . To revitalize by greatly damaged blood drained skin I took an ice cold shower . It was a good decision as i soon learned from my son that there was no hot water , another little luxury not available on the island . As a true adventurer I was still clinging to the expectation of discovering the hidden treasures of the very mountainous island . Truly it had some ? <p> Our first day was mostly spent unwinding and in the early mid afternoon we hopped on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous small shops and boutiques and had a light lunch at a cute cafe on the beach . As that we were in constant need of the internet , we finally settled in for a two hour typing spree to jog down our thoughts and weekly memories of our adventures and experiences thus far . Eventually we pried ourselves from the computers and went back into the sun and commenced a three mile stroll along the beach back toward the villa . With the surf on our right and the tree lined mountains on our left we allowed ourselves to relax and blend into the scenery . Kids and dogs abound in all directions as we stopped to film and photograph the picturesque Latin paradise . <p> On our second day , we got up fairly early and with the aid of the hotels owner , hired a guide and his very old and hopefully reliable , jeep . Only half of the island was explorable by road , even ... even for a world war two jeep . The day adventure began ambient as we bounced along in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we bounced down old weathered roads and goat trails we had no clue what the next curve would bring . The weather had been unrelenting for the first two days with wind and heavy rain and after about two hours into our trip we turned a sharp curve and the driver slammed to a sudden halt . The entire road was blocked by a major landslide ... the entire side of a hill had came crashing down . Trees , tons of mud and giant boulders were sprawled across the road ... totally and definitely ... impassable . I grabbed my cameras and climbing to the top of the displaced rain forest I shot some film and photos , it was not a sight you see everyday . I snapped even more as I walked back to the jeep . Making a u-turn we headed to the northern side of the island . Going back pass our villa we shot , slowly , pass small villages , farm houses and totally bare forests and then headed straight up into the jagged mountain passes . As we climbed higher through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour or so we descended onto a gorgeous beach and like excited school children on a field trip piled from the jeep as we grabbed our bags containing our swimming suites and towels . We sank into the warm water and after becoming water logged took a break to walk the beach and coves in exploration of this section of heaven . If we wanted to see the other side of the island we would have to rent a boat , so renting a boat and guide on our third day was a necessity . <p> On our third and final day we were met by our prearranged guide at a small harbor . He was standing next to a small fishing boat ... eying the size of the boat I hoped for calm sea 's . It was a much better day than we had experienced so far on the island and our filming opportunities in the boat were endless . As much as we had enjoyed our villa , the beach and even the jeep trip on the populated side of the island ... here the hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , small winding trails along the waters edge leading into the heavily treed forests were adventurous , spiritually uplifting and a photographers dream . We even managed to see some cockatoos , toucans and other multi-colored parrots roosting high in the trees along the cliffs . The day came to an end , as all days do , and arriving back in this miniature civilization , we spent the last hours of the evening sipping drinks at a little beach side bar listening to the tropical beat of some local music escaping from a small radio in the distance . Just another rewarding day doing what I love most ... living ! ! ! <p> The fourth morning found us waiting along the road for a taxi to the ferry . A new journey was beginning . The ferry over to the mainland was uneventful , but the trip to Sao Sebastiao was not so uneventful . We had no clue to the bus schedules or where each bus was going . Our small dilemma was becoming slightly painful as we sat on the hard concrete bench for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bench . After an hour and when my backside fell numb , I finally made a decision . As that we had no clue to the buses destinations and that there were no taxis ... and as I have and will always be a true die-hard , and so it was on this day , We starting walking toward where we thought and hoped the town would be . The 120 kilos of luggage made sure we got more than enough exercise along the way . Life on the road , especially with us ... is always an adventure ... and I loved every moment . <p> The hour long walk was , to say the least , tedious and quickly became a body wrenching struggle as we fought to drag and carry our over stuffed bags . The three mile walk was finally rewarded when we entered the sleepy beach side section of Sao Sebastiao . The city itself was sprawled across a much larger area , but we were just where we wanted to be ... in the older section as it had retained its original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and checked into The Roma Hotel . It was quaint , secluded and comfortable . Built more like a motel with individual rooms stretching on two sides of the large treed court yard . After about fifteen minutes of haggling over his ridiculous price ... we went to our separate rooms . Its the same all over the world ... proprietors can smell a tourist before even seeing them ... thus the old . but well rehearsed task bargaining began . I never pay their asking price as I am an old veteran of this silly game and managed to get the room thirty five percent lower than his asking price , which was still probably more than he would of charged a local . Dropping the bags in the room , I spent the quiet evening hours sitting in a small family park across the street while my staff hopped from bar to bar along the beach ... only occasional alcoholics , but that 's our goal ... travel , promote tourism and have a lot of fun along the way . The only reason I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos on the screen of my digital camera and thus ... the dark bench in the park . I would have my fun later . We only spent two nights in the area , but were destined to return many months later . <p> During the first afternoon in Sao Sebastio we met a local taxi driver and with some aid from the English speaking desk clerk managed to make a deal for him to drive us all the way up the coast to the grand city of Rio ... The driver was more than happy to drive us as he was obviously bored of his local tariff and with just a little haggling gave us a really good price . Five hundred Brazilian Real or about $150 US dollars . Driving would give us the opportunities to stop , shoot film and take countless photos without being rushed or restricted by a bus or splurging on expensive airfare . The journey managed to take over ten hours as there were just too many stunning and desolate beaches , cliffs , mountain passes and adorable little villages along the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a tiny fraction of this huge country , as big as the continental USA. and we were slowly , but surely , being mesmerized by its overwhelming beauty . <p> Every town , city and village we drove through was built directly on the coast and each was blessed with gorgeous sandy beaches . It was quite evident of the adoration the Brazilian people felt for the cool waters of its oceans and spent every possible free moment basking in the sun and surf . As the sun was starting its long and laborious decent we neared the city of our destination ... Rio . I must say that the outer edges of the city were at first disparaging as mile after mile of haphazard structures built on top of each other to form huge slums of derelict structures , barely held together with every possible piece of scrap obtainable . As we drove I continued to film and after a while begin to view the area differently . It is not by choice that these poverty subdued people lived in such a manner and in their own unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the visitor . The people , after all , rich or poor , are what a country is all about . The problem is surely not just existence in Brazil , but is one of all third world countries . One thing I will say after a few weeks in Rio .. if the saying " It takes money to make money " has any true merit the obvious gap between the haves and the have-nots here in the large cities of Brazil give it distinct validation . But I was as yet to view the real and overwhelming poverty that at times lay hidden from visitors as it sprawled across the vast rural areas of most Latin countries south of the USA border . Was there a connection ? These lands were rich in minerals and nature assets and the USA was definitely brutal in their dealing with these unacknowledged and at times naive countries . <p> We checked in with an affiliate company in down town Copacabana and after some introductions and hardly hugs we were driven to our prearranged condo one block from the famous beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags in the hallway and started exploring the streets along the beach . The noise of the city was n't loud and obtrusive like other large cities , especially Athens . It was more a combination of light chatter , progressive , but subdued vehicle traffic and the ever present hum of the moving of hundreds of people along the semi-crowded walkways . Business men and women lingered in doorways of bars , shops and eateries ready to greet any prospective customers . Old men sat on anything available , from benches to buckets , and idled away their day with conversation and at times ... long brooding . Countless Women of all ages and attire mingled and strolled through the shops and along the lanes and avenues , some shopping , but mostly window gazing . All were dressed to the limit of their economical status . We made our way to the famous Copacabana Beach , found a side-walk cafe and sat for awhile sipping some cola 's . There was a small crowd gathered around a three membered street band and as they played some soothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made it to Rio de Janeiro . <p> People watching is the fastest way to learn a culture and as a world traveler ... I love watching people ... anywhere and anytime . The poor of the outer regions of the city were abundant along the beach as darkness once again subdued the day . Mingling with the tourists and locals , they begged a little , entertained a little , shined shoes , sold small items of little value and mostly did what they could to survive in the concrete jungle . Throughout the world poverty is the main cause of criminal behavior and trying to exist in these dire hardships the most desperate people betray aggressive behavior ... committing robbery and at times even worst crimes . Poverty and hopelessness are and have always been the root cause of actions and the only way to curb criminal behavior is by providing education and opportunities . It is definitely not solved , but only further agitated , by creating more restrictive laws and an increased police presence only breeds more oppression and thus increase the criminal environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of even more brazen and at times , violent activities . The struggle for survival breeds more degenerate people and after a short learning curve , these hopeless people betray an even more complex criminal element . Doing what ever they feel is justified to obtain the means to not only survive , but to elevate their social status . Then the entire poverty situation becomes even more diversely complex and overwhelms the system . My personal belief is that its cheaper and wiser to feed the poor than it is to convert them to killers . The world is as safe as we make it ... we must all contribute to bettering its degenerating condition , whether its conservation , preservation or helping the poor . The earth is home to each and every one of us and we are , like it or not ... all connected . <p> To all you work-alcoholics and couch potatoes ... turn off your television , set down your beer , park you gas guzzling SUV and get away from your life of repetition ... enjoy your life while you have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fun and glorious beauty to experience in this world and its in need of your awareness and is also just waiting for for you to add your involvement , laughter and amazement to the millions of voices around the globe ... they are after all ... just friends you have n't met yet !

@@48313589 @1813589/ <p> After a great and rewarding tour of Puerto Rico , we flew back to Miami to plan our next tour . Having been throughout Europethere was one place we had n't  managed to tourthe UK , so it was quickly decidedthe UK would be our next destination . Boarding an 8 hour flt to Manchester England , Dakota and I , along with the young man , Hector that joined our crew in Puerto Rico , we were again on the trail of another adventure . Due to the difficulty of flying into London and the immense cost of a taxi ride from Heathrow to the city center , Manchester was the right choice . <p> Landing early on the morning of the 6th of April we rented a midsize car , loaded up and hit the road . I was again driving on the opposite of the road and had to rely on my experience from my months in Australia , New Zealand and other parts of the world once colonized by this very countryEngland . It also was apparent that Germany with its Autobahn was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 160 kilometers an hour , we were often pasted by Jags , Mercedes and even other much smaller cars going 180 KPH or faster . For all you Westerners , KPH means kilometers per hour . Being a speed freak myself , it was n't long before I was pretty much passing everyone on the roadway , but a 100 British Pound ticket from a very friendly policeman soon quenched my thirst for speed . <p> Our first destination was the small and somewhat isolated country of Wales , which normally would only be a few hours drive , but not for usas there was just too much to see and explore . After spending an hour or so driving around the charming city of Manchester we were back on the roadway , but driving somewhat slower . The weather was great with a clear blue sky and a cool 20c temperature , around 68 degrees Fahrenheit which highlighted the English countryside laden with green fields , flowers , and trees , and adorned with well kept houses and cottages . The overall instilled vision was of serenity and balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chester where we would stop for some good ole English Tea and a chance to stretch our legs . The hours spent walking in the old town city center was most definitely a photographic opportunity , as there were incredible old buildings , meandering footpaths of well dressed locals &amp; tourists and shops galore . One attraction was an overhanging stone trestle in the center of the town with a beautifully decorated handcrafted clocka mini Big Ben , as in London . Enjoying our tea and relaxing conversation we people watched for a while longer before proceeding on our trip to Wales . <p> Leaving the countryside the scenery changed quickly and as if in an instant we were driving along a weathered coast of large cliffs and mountainsexposing the ruggedness of the sea-shore and its inherited people . The dark and foreboding ocean was wind-swept and not welcoming to say the least . Continuing for another hour or so we arrived in the small country of Wales and after following small country lanes up into the hills where some lingering snow held firmly to the ground we arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that our choice to stay here would not be a pleasant one . It soon became apparent that the isolated and fearful people of these small communities were anything but welcoming . I do understand that the woman running the guest house was alone , as her husband was at work several kilometers away , and we were 3 men , but as we had exchanged several emails and even a phone call regarding our reservation , she surly was expecting us and that left me in total bewilderment as to why she greeted us , gave us the key to a large apartment like unit and then telephone the police acting hysterical and in fear of her very life . We had no clue and after making some coffee in the units small kitchen , we wandered off to our separate beds for a refreshing nap <p> We were all really tired and quickly fell into a much needed deep sleepit was not to last long , as some pecking and loud banging on the units door and windows abruptly ended our nap and serenity . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to respond . Fighting off the sleep I sat up and tried focusing my eyes in determining what the heck was going on and what or whom was creating all this noise . Looking through the uncovered windows from the bunk I saw several moving figures with bright yellow rain jackets and odd round helmets . Having never really seen the garb of the local police I was , but for a moment , confused . Their belligerent tone and bellowing voices soon identified them , as it seems that police are universal in their mannerismor lack thereof . <p> I quickly pulled on my pants and a tee shirt and unlocked the doorstepping back quickly as a flood of oddly clothed bodies came through the door barking orders . After a few seconds Hector and Dakota walked down the stairs to join this non festive party . The male police were much more restrained in the rudeness and were trying to be firm , but somewhat cordial . In the midst of 10 or more police there was but one female and she was definitely not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large mouth and confronted , not me or Hector , the men in this group , Dakota .

I had been carrying all our passports and had already given them to the male sergeant when asked . The 52 130 pound squat female cop with the big mouth again barked like a Chihuahua at still sleepy Dakota demanding his passport and asked if he did indeed even have a passport . He snapped back with his quick , but at times untamed , wit and in a deep , but firm voice said to her " Actually I swam here to come to your ugly forsaken country .

A time frozen in memory , art , sculpture , legend and in fairy tales . When men were men and ladies in splendid attire floated effortlessly across marble ballrooms . This golden age can still be found in the land of the green rolling hills . Where beaches and bays disappear into the forests of misty mornings and glorious sunsets . A land of endless tales of Kings and Viking long ships , a land of historical culture and master artists ... it all exists in the magical land of Denmark . <p> In this busy world we often forget the deeper meaning of life and are held captive by the turmoil of misbegotten dreams .

@@48313593 @1813593/ <p> Dakota and I , along with our Turkish friend , Yetkin , left the city of Patong , in southern Thailand known as the party , lay on the beach and stay drunk while enjoying long encounters of sexual molestation region and flew to the mega city of Bangkok . What a difference a few hundred miles can make in such a small country . Bangkok can definitely brag of being home to millions of peculiar people and even more peculiar tourists . Stepping from the plane there was something exciting in the air and even at the airport our anticipation grew , as the slight breeze carried the sweet perfumed scent of wild nights and gratifying sexual encounters . My mind was ready and I only hoped my body could keep up ! After all we did spent 3 months in Patong , Phukett and partying on the awesomely gorgeous islands of Phi Phi Dom , Monkey , James Bond and many others . <p> Grabbing a taxi we headed into the very jaws of the city center and was amuck of a few million people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Thai taxis ) and a street scene unlike any I have witnessed ... at least while awake and sober . One large building stood out from the rest and as the taxi pulled up to the corner we could see it was a hotel ... an 88 story hotel . Now that was impressive . Its befitting name , The Sky Hotel , was a magnetic and drew us into its lobby . After some negotiating we scored a penthouse suite for about $40 US . That 's another reason I love this part of the world ... do n't like the price ... whine a little ! <p> We did n't stay in the suite long , as the city was like a beckon light to a moth and so as moths we strolled throughout the city , along the Chao Phraya River in &amp; out of the bars ... countless ... and in meeting numerously impressive people , or should I say girls , women , chicks , party hounds ... we were in love ... again . This was Singapore , Patong and Phuket combined on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just across town we hopped in an open sided tuk-tuk and headed off on a wild ride along with an endless stream of drivers in every type of vehicle imaginable . Loud western music blared from every inch of the street , from the passing cars , bars and hundreds of sidewalk cafes ... it was party time ... again . As for the Sex Palace ... well now that 's another story in itself and is not suitable for posting here ... ahem ! Sorry children , religious freaks and odd perverts ... <p> We managed to stay in this lust devouring city for 7 days and sleepless nights , before finally coming to a surreal and vague form of twisted realization that we were being transformed into vampires of endless self pleasures . If we were to survive we must pry ourselves away and continue to our next destination ... Istanbul . As we boarded the Gulf Air flight we turned and shouted out our solemn promise to return ... soon ! Soon , meaning when we recovered . <p> Our first stop was an overnight layover in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oil baron ... the hotel bar charged my Turkish friend $35 US for one beer ... the sad thing was it was my money ... the bum ! We did n't  know that alcohol was a forbidden pleasure and was served only to foreigners and may I say , at a very hefty price . A long drunk spell here could bankrupt Bill Gates . In my hazy memory I recall that the country consisted of endless heat , blurring visions of sand , lots of bare desert , but to its credit ... unsoiled beaches and a color of the brightest aqua blue water Ive even seen . If Beer was a example of the wealth it took to live here it was no wonder that everyone from 8 to 80 drove a Mercedes and needless to say I was too poor to spend much time here ... no oil in this cowboys back yard and our government spends all our money invading other countries for their oil . Would n't it just be cheaper to buy it ? <p> In a few hours of departing Bahrain we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city is the home of 10+ million souls , mostly Muslims , some Christians and with a hundred other ethnicities thrown in it is quite an unorthodox blending of personalities . Turkey in it 's last count holds over 74 million people and possibly more if you count the hordes of Kurdish and other wanderers courting the tourist trades with their small businesses . They tend to adhere to the coastal cities , such as Marmaris , Kusadasi , Bodrum , Fethiye and Patara , as well as countless other beach towns along the phenomenally beautiful western coast . With their wit , dance and eerie music they do add considerably to the distinguished diversity of the country 's ancient heritage . <p> Again , as custom , we hailed a cab and with our buddy Yetkin doing the talking it was only a few minutes before we pulled in front of a small , but as we soon learned , cheap hotel . As we hauled the massive bags up to the 3rd floor ... I wondered what it was about elevators in most regions of the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get a kick watching their guests needlessly exert themselves and listening to their moans as they sweat feverously in their pitiful attempts at sleep ... but , personally , I hate sweating and especially when it costs me good money . Yetkin had lived here for several years , before moving south to Fethiye to run his brothers bar , and still had a girlfriend in the city and made good time in picking up the phone and making plans with her for dinner ... so much for a friendly invite ... Well , Dakota , looks like we dine alone and not speaking a word of Turkish ... it looked like we would definitely develop a taste for Kebabs ... meat and veggies in a wrap ... its one of those times when you simply point to a picture on a small menu . <p> In an hour or so Yetkin took off and we hopped a taxi without a clue as to even a basic sign language to point him in the general direction of the city center ... I smartly pointed to my blue shirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind we were off . 15 minutes and about 6 bucks later we stood in front of the massive Blue Mosque . An overwhelming structure built during the epitome of the Ottoman Empire a few hundred years prior . It was and remains the center of attention for millions of Muslims and for gawking tourists the world over . Many of Turkeys beautiful Mosques were once grand Churchesquite some fascinating makeovers , to say the least . As we watched thousands of pilgrims disappear into the bowels of the mosque we decided that mingling with them while they chant and sway on their knees would have to come laterright now we needed food . I will pre-warn all yea that stroll through this amazing city ... food and drink always seem to take a back-seat to snapping photos of the never ending array of structures , that and watching the masses of people in hurried pace every couple of hours ... was it prayer time again ? I did hear they head to the mosques 6 or more times a day . I could n't help wonder when they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a mosque every 100 meters , but where 's a cafe when you 're starving ? Religious obsession is great , but there are times when you just have to feed the body . <p> After a couple of hours of endless straying we located a sidewalk cafe and with some help from the waiter and his barest of English dialect , we gobbled down some bizarre , but tasty concoction of local food and a couple bottles of peach juice , Dakota 's favorite , and headed off to explore further . I was like a kid in Disney world ... stopping constantly to shoot a photo , wandering in and out of every street and alley with no clue as to where we were going and really not caring . Everything was an amazement ... it was and is a remarkable city ! Especially the giant indoor maze of yelling salesmen in what they called the market or Bazaar . Everyone kept trying to get us to sit down and have some tea amidst pots of copper , layers of gold jewelry and endless rolls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that 's where the word bizarre comes from ? I can see that ! We eventually made it down to the very heart of the city where the streets turned into walking lanes , housing an endless string of bars and cafes ... so here 's where everyone comes after long days of prayer rituals ? Lots of beer , cheap beer , lined the tables and after a day of swaying on your knees in a mosque ... I can see why ! At about 11 : PM we ran into our good friend , yeah the one that deserted us in this Mecca of millions , Yetkin ... but after one look at his most gorgeous girlfriend I could no longer blame him for abandoning us ... hell ' I would of abandoned my water jug in a precarious trip across the Sahara just to spend an hour with this girl ... wow ! Well , at least , after spotting us he did introduce us , though briefly , and pulled out a couple of chairs for us to jam in at or near the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Damn , I got the chair on the other side of the table ... the one with no view of his delectable girl friend ... meow ! I had no idea that there were women this delicious in Turkey .... who needs food ? Finding a girl like her was worth spending several hours a day on your knees praying ! <p> A few more days of lingering around the city , a city I will never forget , and it was time for Yetkin to get back to work in his brothers bar down south , so , tagging along , we all piled into a bus for a dreadful 17 hour bumpy trip down the length of Turkey . Of all the signs hanging in the bus there was only one I could read ... what ' no smoking ! That 's just cruel and unusual punishment , that along with the worst roads outside of 1996 Beirut , and to mention no air conditioning ... I had only one reactionI went into a no smoking coma . It was short lived when after a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother piled off the bus for a smoke break . Why ban smoking in a country where everyone and their Grand Parents smokes ? Go figure ? I guess it goes along with the fact that they have 100,000 mosques and only 3 hospitals in Istanbul ... hell , everyone dies , so give me another cigarette and we 'll pray over it later . <p> After 10 or more smoke &amp; coke breaks we arrived in the small and quite unimpressive coastal town of Fethiye . What ? I rode a bus for 17 hours to visit a town ' time and everyone else abandoned centuries ago ... but first impressions do n't always last and after a few strong drinks , two hours on a water pipe ... hell ' I fell in love with the place . I ca n't say much about the local women though ... nice tits , but trying to get one to look at you is like sailing a kite to the moon ... impossible . Damn ' there goes my Romeo reputation ! <p> Yetkin saw my disappointment in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look better after some rest . He was proud of this , his home land and with his encouragement we loaded into his friends car and drove to a small hotel where he had made arrangements for us to stay . Fethiye is on the Mediterranean Sea on the southern coast of Turkey and is well known by English and German tourists , but not by many Americans , true of most of the world . When we arrived at the hotel , which was across from the harbor it was n't much to look at , but would suffice until we could find a better one . Our friend and his brother owned and operated two small disco 's , club Bananas and club Mangos and hence we were invited on our first night in town to meet his brother , his tight lipped water pipe smoking Father and other members of his bar staff . I soon learned that drinking small but potent cups of tea and coffee while smoking on a water pipe during the day was more than just customary before a long night of drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wired ! The size and simplicity of the disco 's were not all that impressive , but for this small town they were an accommodating choice for the young disco enthusiasts with little else to do , and were packed each night . I hope the local guys had better luck with the women . After watching for a while it became obvious that it was n't the women with the problem , it was the men . They were way too aggressive . I was getting a little concerned personally when the guys kept hugging and kissing me on the cheek ... It would n't have been so bad if they 'd at least shave . <p> We stayed in Fethiye for a week and grew to like the people and especially the gorgeous harbour lined with tour boats . We took advantage of some free offers to boat around the area if we would share any good pictures with the owners . That was a deal we could n't pass . Spending the days and some early evenings exploring the absolutely stunning harbor and the 12 local islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent there . The boat tours took us to many Greek and Roman ruins scattered amongst the islands . My favorite was Cleopatra 's bath , an ancient ruin of her personal bath houses on a small hidden island . I would have loved being her bath boy ... well ; on second thoughtshe did poison her brother . <p> By the end of our week and as we prepared to leave we explained to our new friends that we wanted to explore other areas . In all honesty , it was just one of the many reasons we had to leaveI was getting strung out on the water pipes , explosive coffee and dancing all night with a bunch of drunk Turks swinging their arms in all directions . It was all becoming quite nerve wrecking to say the least . In lieu of our quick demise and decaying health we rented a small car , a Fiat , a gutless little thing with the power of a lawn-power , and ventured over the mountains for about 24 kilometers to a small beach village Yetkin had recommended . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Thailand that had originally asked us to help free Yetkin from jail ... That story may or may not ever be posted ! The brothers had made it quite clear that we were very welcome and would n't need to spend a dime ... that and $5 bucks will get you a cup of Star Bucks coffee , but we 'd soon find out if their promise had any real value . <p> The small tourist village of Oludeniz lay along the narrow coast on one of the area 's best beaches . The brothers , Ahmet and Krudet owned a tour and excursion business named Focus Tours . They provided all sorts of adventures , such as paragliding off a 2000 meter mountain ... I would definitely need a bottle of whiskey ... Yeah , the feet in the pic . hanging 6000 feet over the ocean are mine and with a cigarette in my mouth and 3 shots of whiskey in my gutit was great ! <p> They also rented mopeds , had a large boat with a water slide that shot you out into the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They also had some wild jeep tours in the mountains and for you animal lovers ... they even had some horses for an ass swelling journey through an awesome mountainous forest to the ancient ghost town of Kaya Koyu . <p> The tourist village of Oludeniz consisted of many small buildings strung along the beach . The shops , bars and cafes were mostly constructed of wood , stone and bamboo . There were enough bars to keep even the most intense alcoholic happy and numerous Shish Kebab joints for those meat &amp; veggies on a stick lovers ... hey ' I actually became quite fond of them after my 5oth or so . While there were many restaurants , I found there were definitely few bargains . In fact I found that just eating anything in Turkey , other than a kebab , was somewhat expensive . As for lodging , the small , local hotels were very reasonable , but prices of the larger tourist traps were astronomical , mostly due to the fact they were directly on the beach and had pools . They also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pools ... what ' who me ? I also discovered that Turkish businesses had two prices , a very modest one for the locals and a much higher one for the tourists . I do n't approve of this practice , but it is quite common in most third world countries . The trick for getting better prices is to take along a local and have them order or make purchases for you . As in most of Turkey , the tourist consisted mainly of Germans and English and due to the exorbitant prices of everything in Europe they consider everything here a real bargain and are always making stupid exclamations as to how cheap everything is ... which encourages the locals to jack up their prices even higher ... sheesh ! <p> The shops , cafes , hotels and bar owners were a frightful mix of Turkish and their dreadfully despised cousins ... the Kurds . Oh , if I could of only understood the heated words being flung back and forth when these two groups got too close to each other ... yow ! One thing I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they liked you they were quick to bond , but watch out for their body squeezes and cheek kisses ... their whiskers are like barb wired . Dakota and I adored these friendly teddy bear people and made many friends . I miss them all , but for the local women ... forget it ... They are quite shy towards all men , Turkish or otherwise . Grab a German women , they come to have fun , ( not my first choice of words , but this is a family journal ) and it really does n't matter if you 're Turkish or not ... I will also inform you that if you expect to develop any type of physical relationship with the local women , unless you are a recognized superstar or very rich and famous , or both ... do n't  waste your time ! Their culture combined with the over-bearing male machismo they live with daily has pretty much hardened them to any attempt at a quick romance . They consider any approach as one of two things ... you are either a male whore-dog or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing . However , if they believe your intentions are honorable you must be ready to spend several months or longer courting them , meeting their very jealous and extremely protective families and then it 's off to the Mosque for a Muslim wedding . Since they remain very close to their Mothers and the rest of their time is spent praying ... you just might never get laid ... <p> As for any negative treatment , even as an American , we did n't experience any during our 3 months spent touring Turkey . Yes , Turkey is a Muslim country , but for most part is an ally of America and even more ... they are a fun loving people and enjoy their hard gained freedoms .... just beware of the treacherous water pipes , their potent tea &amp; coffee , wild dancing moves and be prepared for lots of hugs and cheek abrasions from the mens unshaved beards . I do however ; suggest not refusing their hospitality , as they are a sensitive lot . <p> Our next journeys would take us on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 3 days , then further up the coast for a couple of days in Bodrum and a few days later onto Kusadasi and a day trip to the ancient Roman ruins of Ephesus . <p> During one of our many escapades we enjoyed a taxi ride on some camels to the amazing , Cappa Dwellings . The ride was somewhat uncomfortable , but with their slow and steady pace through the hot desert we safely arrived in this very ancient village where people thousands of years previous had built their homes by carving and hollowing out bizarre mounds of rock . It reminded me of the giant mounds of termites in Australia . Any amount of discomfort would have been gladly endured to witness this phenomenal vision of human engineering . Our long day spent there added even more unforgettable memories to our adventures in this wonderland of perplexities ! <p> We totally recommend touring the beautiful , multi cultured country of Turkey and it is one of our top 10 countries we suggest visiting during your life . <p> After leaving Turkey we would island hop for 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of living a dream ! <p> Review written by the touring editor ; Mike Smith in June 2003 ; Revised August 18th 2006 <p> This editorial in its entirety is the sole property of Travelers Digest and may not be distributed , sold or copied without prior written permission of Travelers Digest and/or its licensed representatives . <p> Visas : A passport and visa are required for Americans , however they can currently purchase a 90-day sticker visa at the port of entry for $20 cash if they are traveling as tourists .

Founded In the 13th century by the Teutonic Order it rapidly became the biggest town in the state . It developed into a resilient trade centre of Hanseatic League within a short period of time . Torun played an important economic and political role in the entire Teutonic State . Nevertheless the majority of its German origin citizenry in 1454 started the Polish-Teutonic Thirteen Year War and eventually chose the rule of the Polish kings .

Then Torun was the center of important international events of religious and political matters . In the 17th and 18th centuries the German Protestant population lived here side by side with the mainly Polish Catholic inhabitants . The contacts resulted in many conflicts . In 1724 a row between the Protestant population and Catholic student of Jesuit college occurred . The outcome of the " Torun Tumult " captivated the public and politicians ' opinion from Prussia to England . <p> Architecture of Torun " Torun is an immensely beautiful town of magnificent buildings and their gleaming red slate roofs . There not many places in the entire world that compare with its beauty , situation and splendour " - this is how the Polish medieval historiographer Jan Dlugosz described Torun in his chronicles . These words are not without foundation . The colour of brick predominant in the town was so striking as to prompt the simile ' red like Torun ' . The monumental buildings , which have earned Torun its established place in the inventory of European art , are of special value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with three great churches are to this day the living museum replete with ingenious works of art produced in the workshops of medieval , Renaissance and Baroque Torun .

Even so , the art of Torun has its own individual expression . <p> Gothic architecture constitutes Torun 's richest complex of medieval burgher buildings in all of Poland . Beginning with the 16th century Torun found itself in the centre of the new Netherlands-type Renaissance whose form became universal in northern Europe .

The delegates handed over a symbolic miniature of the " Bell of Freedom " to the authorities of Torun and expressed hope that the closer contacts between the to cities would be established . During the celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the United States city of Philadelphia , where the monument of Copernicus stands was called the Torun Triangle , whereas in March 1976 a street by the Vistula River in Torun was named Philadelphia Boulevard ( Bulwar Filadelfijski ) .

We do , however recommend placing the Polish cities of Torun , Warsaw , Krakow and especially the enchanting city of Gdansk on the Baltic Sea .

@@48313598 @1813598/ <p> On the 20th of Oct 2004 Travelers Digest sent me and my son to Austin Texas to establish a new office . Our main objective was to create a new in-depth directory for the city 's best businesses . While being fortunate in locating many excellent businesses , we also discovered many poorly run businesses and one was the Billiard and Pool Bar known as Slick Willies . This particular location is at 1509 S. Lamar Suite 600 . <p> My son , Dakota , and I were looking for a good place to enjoy our love for the game of pool and wandered in to the business . After a few visits we were greeted by one of their several managers , Chris Peterson . He was charming and pleasant and after a few moments of chatting and learning what we did for a living he offered to exchange free , unlimited pool for some advertising in our new Austin Directory . We were pleased to accept and that same night added a direct link to their website along with a personal short , but favorable commentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website requires membership and annual dues , a minimum of $250.00 a month . The ad posted for Slick Willies would of normally been charged a fee of $600.00 a month , but were satisfied in doing the exchange and like anyone , expected our agreement to be honored . The manager making the agreement was always pleasant when we came in to play pool and honored his agreement , but when we came in during other manager 's shifts , we we not treated with courtesy and were made to feel unwelcome . Most of the female waitresses , while being cordial were slow to wait on us and would convert to rudeness when we presented one or more of the signed free pool cards given by Chris . The situation worsen and on our Dec. 24th visit we were confronted by one of the assistant managers , Don Spencer , and were told quite rudely that he could not and would not honor any free pool over one hour as they were very busy and could make $12.00 an hour from paying customers . <p> The way we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demeanor was loud and confrontational . His precise words were that we were not welcome when they were busy and that we should be grateful for the time that we had been given . He went on telling us that he did n't value our company or our ads and went on to say that he had visited our site and saw no marketing value . As he spoke I was made to feel like we were charity cases . He showed total disrespect and when I challenged his words he immediately informed me that he was repeating what his district manager , Justin Soechting , had relayed . Asking if this manager was present , he walked me over to where he was standing . I stuck out my hand and tried to introduce myself , but my handshake was refused . With a contemptuous voice he stated that he knew who I was . In the following few minutes he was more than rude he was contemptible and clearly stated the the agreement previously made between us and his manager , Chris Peterson would not be honored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , be obligated to honor such agreements as made by their management staff . His grunt reply was they did n't have to honor anything and that he was not going to discuss it further . I immediately saw where this was going and in bewilderment , we left the premises . It is sad that Slick Willies believes it is exempt from professional protocol or even showing respect . <p> Slick Willies was apparently a very poorly run business and after researching other pool halls and bars offering comparably services , we soon discovered that not only was Slick Willies not a reputable business ... its prices were greatly inflated and its services were poor in comparison with other visited businesses .

Knowing that each and every number represented a human being was staggering and quite sickening . The war museum 's large , multi-floored interior was overwhelmingly decreed and illustrated . The exterior of the building was just as grand with it 's impressive flower garden and towering memorial statue , giving the entire scene a surreal appearance . <p> We enjoyed our daily walks , even though the weather was often cold , wet and windy , but even under those conditions I was amazed with each new discovery .

Masterfully acoustical , it was favored and frequented by local and traveling musicians . Solo guitarists to entire bands played everything from jazz to Mozart .

Most Dasha 's are in the not so distant country side , offering the families some warranted peace from their jobs in the city . This quiet time is spent harvesting their gardens , hiking in the forested hills and just spending quality time together .

Another option is the Armani Hotel , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tallest building " and is the only Armani Hotel in the world . <p> As one might expect , a visit to Dubai is not cheap , nor is it modest . High-profile conventions and events take place throughout the year , and jet-setters come in and out of Dubai 's stunning international airport at a breakneck pace . <p> The stunning architecture of the Burj Al Arab is only a tease of the wonders awaiting inside . <h> Abu Dhabi <p> For most of recent history Abu Dhabi has been in the shadow of its more glamorous cousin , as Dubai has attracted the vast majority of attention from international travelers . This , however , is beginning to change as Abu Dhabi is making a serious push for consideration as one of the world 's greatest cities . <p> Though inherently more modest than Dubai , Abu Dhabi has still managed to attract top-tier events like the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix " an annual Formula One race . Some more incredibly impressive attractions are planned for the city , and construction is currently underway on the Louvre Abu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two museums will turn Abu Dhabi into one of the world 's principal cities of the arts , and make it difficult to imagine a trip to the UAE that does n't include at least a stop in Abu Dhabi . <p> The Grand Mosque is a reminder of Abu Dhabis conservative and cultural past .

Nevada with 2,915,000 visitors <p> Virtually every visitor to Nevada in 2013 also visited Las Vegas , which is such a huge tourist destination that 2.9 million international visitors is just a drop in the bucket . Once international visitors arrive to Las Vegas they can expect to share the Strip with tons of American tourists , as Las Vegas is the most popular domestic travel destination by a mile . <p> Though Las Vegas has a lot more than just gambling to offer , its gambling is pretty good too . <h> 4 . Hawaii with 3,172,000 visitors <p> Though Hawaii gets a huge amount of domestic visitors , its international visitors pale in comparison to states like California and Florida . Which is not to say that Hawaiis beaches are lacking in appeal . But the state does n't  have the urban appeal of Florida or California and its isolated position in the Pacific limits its visitors to mostly Asian travelers . <p> The view of Honolulu from the peak of Diamond Head . <h> 3 . California with 6,472,000 visitors <p> California is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million overseas visitors . Combined , the three most visited states in America account for an astonishing 73% of all overseas visitors to the United States . So why do visitors come in such huge numbers to California ? Well , its the state with the best air connections to Asia , it has a host of amazing national parks and its two chief cities , San Francisco and Los Angeles , have great international reputations . <p> The skyline of San Francisco and the Painted Ladies of Alamo Square Park . <h> 2 . Florida with 7,209,000 visitors <p> Florida is also holding its position as the second most visited state in America , with 7.2 million visitors in 2013 . The numbers make perfect sense when one considers the sheer amount of tourist attractions that can be found in Florida : the beaches and nightclubs of Miami , the amusement parks of Orlando , Disney World and the natural beauty of Key West . <p> Even Miley Cyrus loves a visit to Orlandos Disney World ! <h> 1 . New York with 9,804,000 visitors <p> Like the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other state in 2013 with almost 10 million visitors or 30% of all foreign visitors to the United States . As the numbers exclude any Canadians who might pop down to Buffalo for shopping or to use the airport , New Yorks incredible numbers speaks volumes about the ability of New York City to captivate foreign visitors . <p> View of New Yorks Central Park in the fall along with the Hudson River and the Upper West Side
