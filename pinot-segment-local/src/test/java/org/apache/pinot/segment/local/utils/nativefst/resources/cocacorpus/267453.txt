Transfusions are often given unnecessarily . Blood conservation represents the use of alternatives to transfusion . <p> Blood conservation measures used at Trillium and common to most ONTraC ( The Ontario Transfusion Coordinators ) participants is the self donation/autologous blood transfusion program and the use of medication therapies to treat anaemia . Patients are screened preoperatively ( complete blood count ) and offered the most appropriate blood conservation measure . This initiative allows us to maximize blood counts and therefore reduce/eliminate the need for blood transfusions postoperatively . <h> Blood Conservation Clinic at Credit Valley Hospital <p> The Blood Conservation Coordinator is located on the 3rd Floor in the Ambulatory Care area of the Carlo Fidani Building . Adults requiring surgery who are interested in avoiding blood transfusion may make an appointment directly by calling ( 905 ) 813-1100 ext. 5540 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a family doctor affiliated with Credit Valley Hospital . Alternatively , your doctor can also make the referral for you . <p> Many blood transfusions associated with elective surgery can be avoided through advanced planning and preparation , if there is sufficient time before surgery . Once you know that you are having surgery in the future , it may be important to ask your doctor for a blood test to determine your hemoglobin level . Generally , the higher your iron or hemoglobin level the less chance of requiring a blood transfusion during your surgical hospital stay . Not all surgeries result in a transfusion risk , so check with your doctor or the blood conservation coordinator first to determine if your surgery might require a Blood Conservation Clinic visit . <p> Blood Conservation strategies may include : <p> Diet <p> Oral Iron <p> Intravenous Iron <p> Pre-donation of your own blood ( autologous donation ) <p> Eprex- injections <p> A plan can be developed according to individual needs . It is important to remember that the more time before surgery the more beneficial when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blood Transfusion <p> Why might a transfusion be needed ? Blood is needed for the human body to work properly . The need for transfusion depends on the kind of condition a patient has . Most transfusions are given to treat anemia ( a low blood count ) or severe bleeding . The benefit of a transfusion is to improve the patient 's condition . When anemia or bleeding is extremely severe , a patient may die if a transfusion is not given . <p> How is blood transfused ? Blood is given into a vein ( usually an arm vein ) using a new sterile disposable needle . The transfusion may be of red blood cells , plasma , platelets or other specialized products made from blood . A doctor will decide on the right amount and type of blood product required for treatment . <p> Is it safe ? Blood transfusion is a common procedure with low risk . Blood is safer than it has ever been , but is not risk-free . Some problems that may occur with transfusion are listed below : <p> Bruising or swelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Minor and temporary reactions occur in about 1 in 100 people . These reactions include fever , chills or rash during or shortly after transfusion . <p> All blood is tested for infectious diseases , but there is still a very small risk of disease transmission . The risk of getting HIV is 1 in 7.8 million , Hepatitis B is 1 in 153,000 and Hepatitis C is 1 in 2.3 million . The risk of getting other viruses ( known or unknown ) is very small . <p> Other rare but serious risks include acute lung injury at 1 in 5,000 , anaphylaxis is 1 in 40,000 and errors resulting in the wrong blood being transfused is 1 in 40,000 . <p> These risks are small compared to the potential benefits of transfusion . For comparison the chance of dying in a motor vehicle accident is 1 in 10,000 and the chance of death by drowning is 1 in 100,000 . <p> What are the alternatives to transfusion ? Alternatives include patients storing their own blood before surgery , drugs to increase the red blood cells count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . Not all patients can use these alternatives and when bleeding or severe anemia is life-threatening , there is no effective substitute for blood transfusion.If you are interested in alternatives to transfusion of adults please refer to the information available on the Blood Conservation Clinic at Credit Valley Hospital.If you have questions or concerns regarding potential transfusion of blood , please contact your doctor .

An artery or vein from another part of the body is grafted to the heart to bypass the narrowed area . To accomplish this the heart must be stopped . A heart-lung machine diverts the blood during the operation and subsequently re-pumps the blood back into the body . Coronary bypass surgery is often used when the patient has several blockages and is not considered a candidate for angioplasty .

Patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery no longer face long and painful recoveries at Mississauga Hospital due to the introduction of minimally invasive heart surgery . Coronary artery bypass operations involve the surgeon making a cut into the chest and sawing open the breastbone to gain access to the heart . Now , due to innovative technology introduced by Medtronic of Canada Limited and special expertise by Mississauga Hospital 's cardiac surgeons , access to the heart is gained through a small cut ( 6 cm ) between the ribs , eliminating the need to split the breastbone . The patient benefits of this new procedure include : much less pain during recovery , less complications from wound healing , less chance of infection , less blood loss due to the breaking of the breastbone , a much faster recovery and no unsightly scars .

Typically one must practice twice a day for one to two weeks to begin to feel the full benefits of relaxation training . Some people notice a difference right away , and others may need to practice for several weeks before they begin to notice a change in how they feel in their bodies .

Find a place that is quiet and free from distractions . It will also work best for you to be in a comfortable position , such as sitting in a reclining chair or lying on your bed . Loosen any tight clothing , remove your shoes , and remove any devices that may cause discomfort , such as your eyeglasses .

It will take less and less time to achieve a state of deep relaxation . As you become more skilled at relaxing , try to use it in less comfortable and quiet places , such as a waiting room or at times when you feel tense or upset . <p> Following an audio version of these general instructions , there are three different relaxation techniques presented in these audio files .

@@24341337 @4341337/ <p> What is Gastroscopy ? Gastroscopy let 's your doctor examine the lining of the upper part of your gastrointestinal tract , which includes the esophagus , stomach and duodenum ( first portion of the small intestine ) . Your doctor will use a thin , flexible tube called an endoscope , which has its own lens and light source , and will view the images on a video monitor . You might hear your doctor or other medical staff refer to Gastroscopy as upper GI endoscopy , **26;229;TOOLONG ( EGD ) or panendoscopy . <p> Why is Gastroscopy done ? Gastroscopy helps your doctor evaluate symptoms of persistent upper abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting or difficulty swallowing . It 's the best test for finding the cause of bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract . It 's also more accurate than X-ray films for detecting inflammation , ulcers and tumors of the esophagus , stomach and duodenum . Your doctor might use Gastroscopy to obtain a biopsy ( small tissue samples ) . A biopsy helps your doctor distinguish between benign and malignant ( cancerous ) tissues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your doctor might order one even if he or she does not suspect cancer . For example , your doctor might use a biopsy to test for Helicobacter pylori , the bacterium that causes ulcers . Your doctor might also use Gastroscopy to perform a cytology test , where he or she will introduce a small brush to collect cells for analysis . Gastroscopy is also used to treat conditions of the upper gastrointestinal tract . Your doctor can pass instruments through the endoscope to directly treat many abnormalities - this will cause you little or no discomfort . For example , your doctor might stretch ( dilate ) a narrowed area , remove polyps ( usually benign growths ) or treat bleeding . <p> What preparations are required ? An empty stomach allows for the best and safest examination , so you should have nothing to eat or drink , including water , after Midnight the night before your examination . Your doctor will tell you when to start fasting as the timing can vary . Tell your doctor in advance about any medications you take ; you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Discuss any allergies to medications as well as medical conditions , such as heart or lung disease . <p> Can I take my current medications ? Most medications can be continued as usual , but some medications can interfere with the preparation or the examination . Inform your doctor about medications you 're taking , particularly aspirin products or antiplatelet agents , arthritis medications , anticoagulants ( blood thinners such as warfarin or heparin ) , clopidogrel , insulin or iron products . Also , be sure to mention any allergies you have to medications . <p> What happens during Gastroscopy ? Your doctor might start by spraying your throat with a local anesthetic or by giving you a sedative to help you relax . You 'll then lie on your side , and your doctor will pass the endoscope through your mouth and into the esophagus , stomach and duodenum . The endoscope does n't interfere with your breathing , Most patients consider the test only slightly uncomfortable , and many patients fall asleep during the procedure . <p> What happens after Gastroscopy ? You will be monitored until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your throat might be a little sore , and you might feel bloated because of the air introduced into your stomach during the test . You will be able to eat one hour after you leave unless your doctor instructs you otherwise . Your physician will explain the results of the examination to you , although you 'll probably have to wait for the results of any biopsies performed . If you have been given sedatives during the procedure , someone must drive you home and stay with you . Even if you feel alert after the procedure , your judgment and reflexes could be impaired for the rest of the day . <p> What are the possible complications of Gastroscopy ? Although complications can occur , they are rare when doctors who are specially trained and experienced in this procedure perform the test . Bleeding can occur at a biopsy site or where a polyp was removed , but it 's usually minimal and rarely requires follow-up . Perforation ( a hole or tear in the gastrointestinal tract lining ) may require surgery but this is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sedatives or complications from heart or lung disease . Although complications after Gastroscopy are very uncommon , it 's important to recognize early signs of possible complications . Contact your doctor immediately if you have a fever after the test or if you notice trouble swallowing or increasing throat , chest or abdominal pain , or bleeding , including black stools . Note that bleeding can occur several days after the procedure . If you have any concerns about a possible complication , it is always best to contact your doctor right away .

@@24341445 @4341445/ <p> What is a PEG ? PEG stands for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy , a procedure in which a flexible feeding tube is placed through the abdominal wall and into the stomach . PEG allows nutrition , fluids and/or medications to be put directly into the stomach , bypassing the mouth and esophagus . This brochure will give you a basic understanding of the procedure - how it 's performed , how it can help , and what side effects you might experience . <p> How is the PEG performed ? Your doctor will use a lighted flexible tube called an endoscope to guide the creation of a small opening through the skin of the upper abdomen and directly into the stomach . This procedure allows the doctor to place and secure a feeding tube into the stomach . Patients generally receive an intravenous sedative and local anesthesia , and an antibiotic is given by vein prior to the procedure . Patients can usually go home the day of the procedure or the next day . <p> Who can benefit from a PEG ? Patients who have difficulty swallowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrition through the mouth can benefit from this procedure . <p> How should I care for the PEG tube ? A dressing will be placed on the PEG site following the procedure . This dressing is usually removed after one or two days . After that you should clean the site once a day with diluted soap and water and keep the site dry between cleansings . No special dressing or covering is needed . <p> How are feedings given ? Can I still eat and drink ? Specialized liquid nutrition , as well as fluids , are given through the PEG tube . If the PEG tube is placed because of swallowing difficulty ( e.g. , after a stroke ) , there will still be restrictions on oral intake . Although a few PEG patients may continue to eat or drink after the procedure , this is a very important issue to discuss with your physician . <p> Are there complications from PEG placement ? Complications can occur with the PEG placement . Possible complications include pain at the PEG site , leakage of stomach contents around the tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Possible complications include infection of the PEG site , aspiration ( inhalation of gastric contents into the lungs ) , bleeding and perforation ( an unwanted hole in the bowel wall ) . Your doctor can describe for you symptoms that could indicate a possible complication . <p> How long do these tubes last ? How are they removed ? PEG tubes can last for months or years . However , because they can break down or become clogged over extended periods of time , they might need to be replaced . Your doctor can easily remove or replace a tube without sedatives or anesthesia , although your doctor might opt to use sedation and endoscopy in some cases . Your doctor will remove the tube using firm traction and will either insert a new tube or let the opening close if no replacement is needed . PEG sites close quickly once the tube is removed , so accidental dislodgment requires immediate attention . <p> What Preparation is required for a PEG ?

Scan . Physician 's offices can fax requisition to Imaging booking desk to facilitate an appointment <p> What is a C.T. ? A computed tomography ( C.T. ) scan is a relatively simple study that produces a series of images that can detect many conditions that are not detectable with conventional x-rays.During the study a thin beam of radiation is focused on the specific body part to be studied . The x-ray tube moves completely around this body part as the table moves the patient through the scanner . This creates multiple cross sectional images which are sometimes compiled into 3D images when necessary . Due to the precision of these studies the patients must lie completely still . Some C.T . scans require the use of a contrast media in the form of a drink or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels and organs so they can be easily seen . <p> Who performs a C.T . scan ? The scans are performed by Medical Radiation Technologists who have specialized training in C.T . scanning . <p> C.T . Paediatric Prep:Please allow a minimum of 6 hours for your appointment if your child is being sedated.Check with your Paediatrician/Family Doctor for specific instructions . <p> DefinitionComputerized Tomography scanning " sometimes called CT scanning " is a noninvasive medical test that helps physicians diagnose and treat medical conditions.CT scanning combines special x-ray equipment with sophisticated computers to produce multiple images or pictures of the inside of the body . These cross-sectional images of the area being studied can then be examined on a computer monitor or printed.CT scans of internal organs , bone , soft tissue and blood vessels provide greater clarity and reveal more details than regular x-ray exams.CT scanning provides more detailed information on : <p> head injuries , stroke , brain tumors and other brain diseases <p> internal organs , bone , soft tissue and blood vessels <p> Using specialized equipment and expertise to create and interpret CT scans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as cancers , cardiovascular disease , infectious disease , trauma and musculoskeletal disorders . <p> How to Prepare for the ExamYou should wear comfortable , loose-fitting clothing to your exam . You may be given a gown to wear during the procedure.Metal objects including jewelry , may also be asked to remove hearing aids and removable dental work.You may be asked not to eat or drink anything for several hours beforehand , especially if a contrast material will be used in your exam . You should inform your physician of any medications you are taking and if you have any allergies . If you have a known allergy to contrast material , or " dye , " your doctor may prescribe medications to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction . Also inform your doctor of any recent illnesses or other medical conditions , and if you have a history of heart disease , asthma , diabetes , kidney disease or thyroid problems . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse effect . Women should always inform their physician and the CT technologist if there is any possibility that they are pregnant . <p> How is the CT Scan Performed ? The technologist begins by positioning you on the CT examination table , usually lying flat on your back or possibly on your side or on your stomach . Straps and pillows may be used to help you maintain the correct position and to hold still during the exam . If contrast material is used , it will be swallowed , injected through an intravenous line ( IV ) or administered by enema , depending on the type of examination.Next , the table will move quickly through the scanner to determine the correct starting position for the scans . Then , the table will move slowly through the machine as the actual CT scanning is performed.You may be asked to hold your breath during the scanning . Any motion , whether breathing or body movements , can lead to artifacts on the images . This is similar to the blurring seen on a photograph taken of a moving object.When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the technologist verifies that the images are of high enough quality for accurate interpretation.CT scanning of the body is usually completed within 30 minutes . <p> What will I experience during and after the procedure ? CT exams are generally painless , fast and easy . With modern CT , the amount of time that the patient needs to lie still is reduced.Though the scanning itself causes no pain , there may be some discomfort from having to remain still for several minutes . If you have a hard time staying still , are claustrophobic or have chronic pain , you may find a CT exam to be stressful.If an intravenous contrast material is used , you will feel a slight pin prick when the needle is inserted into your vein . You may have a warm , flushed sensation during the injection of the contrast materials and a metallic taste in your mouth that lasts for a few minutes . Some patients may experience a sensation like they have to urinate but this subsides quickly.Occasionally , a patient will develop itching and hives , which can be relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing , you should notify the technologist , as it may indicate a more severe allergic reaction . A radiologist or other physician will be available for immediate assistance.If the contrast material is swallowed , you may find the taste mildly unpleasant ; however , most patients can easily tolerate it . You can expect to experience a sense of abdominal fullness and an increasing need to expel the liquid if your contrast material is given by enema . In this case , be patient , as the mild discomfort will not last long.When you enter the CT scanner , special lights may be used to ensure that you are properly positioned . With modern CT scanners , you will hear only slight buzzing , clicking and whirring sounds as the CT scanner revolves around you during the imaging process.You will be alone in the exam room during the CT scan . However , the technologist will be able to see , hear and speak with you at all times . After a CT exam , you can return to your normal activities . <h> Mammography <p> A referral is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a mammogram . <p> An appointment can be made by calling the Imaging booking desk . Please bring your requisition with you the day of your appointment . If you have had a previous mammogram at another facility , please bring the films with you to your appointment .

Most commonly done on females ages 40 and up , it is also occasionally necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are most commonly used as a screening device for early detection of breast disease . Patients who feel a lump in their breast or have an unusual discharge from their nipple should also be evaluated.Many women have their first screening mammogram in their 40 's . Mammograms are recommended once every two years over the age of 50 . Some women may be asked to come back in one year instead of two.A screening mammogram usually requires 4 pictures ( 2 pictures of each breast ) taken in different directions . Because patients come in their own shape and size , extra pictures may be required.The breast is pulled forward and compressed between the image receptor and a clear plastic compression paddle . When the breast is well compressed , the breast structures can be optimally visualized on the x-ray.The goal of mammography is to visualize all the breast tissue to ensure the patient receives a thorough examination . <p> Mammogram PreparationPlease allow a minimum of 30 minutes for your appointment.DO NOT use deodorant or talcum powder . Wear a 2 piece outfit.Note : Our hours have now been extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific type of imaging that uses a low-dose x-ray system to examine breasts . A mammography exam , called a mammogram , is used to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of breast diseases in women , and occasionally men.An x-ray ( radiograph ) is a noninvasive medical test that helps physicians diagnose and treat medical conditions . Imaging with x-rays involves exposing a part of the body to a small dose of ionizing radiation to produce pictures of the inside of the body . X-rays are the oldest and most frequently used form of medical imaging . <p> Common UsesMammograms are used as a screening tool to detect early breast cancer in women experiencing no symptoms and to detect and diagnose breast disease in women experiencing symptoms such as a lump , pain or nipple discharge . <p> How is the procedure performed ? Mammography is performed on an outpatient basis . <p> Before the Procedure <p> The best time for a mammogram is one week following your period . <p> Do not schedule your mammogram for the week before your period if your breasts are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or x-ray technologist if there is any possibility that you are pregnant . <p> Do not wear deodorant , talcum powder or lotion under your arms or on your breasts on the day of the exam . These can appear on the mammogram as calcium spots . <p> Describe any breast symptoms or problems to the technologist performing the exam . <p> If possible , obtain prior mammograms and make them available to the radiologist at the time of the current exam . <p> During the Exam <p> A specially qualified radiology technologist will position your breast in the mammography unit . <p> Your breast will be placed on a special platform and compressed with a paddle ( often made of clear Plexiglas or other plastic ) . The technologist will gradually compress your breast . <p> You will be asked to change positions between images . The routine views are a top-to-bottom view and an oblique side view . The process will be repeated for the other breast . <p> You must hold very still and may be asked to keep from breathing for a few seconds while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurred image . <p> The technologist will walk behind a wall or into the next room to activate the x-ray machine <p> Why Compress the Breast ? <p> Even out the breast thickness so that all of the tissue can be visualized . <p> Spread out the tissue so that small abnormalities are less likely to be obscured by overlying breast tissue <p> Allow the use of a lower x-ray dose since a thinner amount of breast tissue is being imaged . <p> Hold the breast still in order to minimize blurring of the image caused by motion . <p> Reduce x-ray scatter to increase sharpness of picture . <p> After the ExamWhen the examination is complete , you will be asked to wait until the radiologist determines that all the necessary images have been obtained . The examination process should take about 30 minutes . <h> Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) <p> Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) is a painless , non-invasive diagnostic imaging technology that uses a strong magnetic field and radio frequency ( RF ) waves to produce images . The scanner creates a magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tissue response is then measured and an image is created from this information . During the scan loud noises up to 93 dB can be produced , therefore patients must wear ear plugs or a head set to protect their hearing.MRI scans can provide information about the brain , spine , joints , organs and vessels . MRI can also illustrate differences in tissues that may not be visible with other imaging modalities . Some MR examinations require an injection of Gadolinium to visualize structures more clearly . Gadolinium has a paramagnetic property that makes it appear bright within a magnetic field . It can be helpful in demonstrating vascular structures within tissues . <p> Booking MRI Appointments:In order to help us provide efficient MRI services please follow the following guidelines . <p> All MRI requisitions must be fully completed with the following : <p> patient 's full name and date of birth , <p> area of interest to be scanned <p> appropriate clinical information <p> All MRI requests must include a completed MRI Information &amp; Screening Form . It is important that the patient both completes and signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the form . Operative reports may be requested to ensure patient safety prior to the booking of an appointment . An MRI may be contraindicated if the patient has surgically implanted devices . <p> Any patients with a history of exposure to metal fragments in or around the eyes , or exposure to metal dust in the workplace ( i.e. welders , metal workers ) , will require a pre MRI orbital x-ray to ensure there are no metallic foreign objects within the orbit . <p> If a patient suffers from claustrophobia and requires sedation prior to the MRI , the ordering physician must arrange a prescription for the patient prior to their MRI exam . The MRI department does not provide sedation . If a patient is prescribed sedation they must be accompanied home by another adult . The patient may not drive home after the sedation . <p> MRI Policies : <p> Post-op PolicyAll MRI requests that are within 6-8 weeks of surgery must be approved by the radiologist .

To ensure patient safety all implanted devices should be listed on the screening form including the type and model of implant . <p> Breast Feeding PolicyPatient who require an injection of gadolinium are advised to express and discard breast milk for 24 hours after the examination . <p> Pregnancy PolicyThere have been no reported adverse effects demonstrated in pregnant women or the fetus ; however the FDA guidelines suggest that MRI be used during pregnancy only when there are clear medical indications . Our policy is to avoid an MRI unless requested by a Neurosurgeon or Neurologist and a consent form must be signed with a Radiologist . <p> Trans-Dermal Medication PatchesAll trans-dermal medication patches should be removed prior to the MRI exam . It is important that the ordering physician is aware that the medication patch is being removed so they can instruct their patient when to reapply it . <p> MRI Safety <p> Contraindicated Objects &amp; Implanted Devices : <p> cardiac pacemaker <p> cardiac defibrillator <p> neurostimulator <p> pacing wires <p> implanted insulin pump <p> Swan-Ganz catheters <p> implanted infusion pumps <p> shrapnel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> eye implants ( require operative report ) <p> intravascular stents , coils , valves ( require type and model ) <p> ear implants ( require operative report ) <p> some intracranial aneurysm clips <p> CAD pumps <p> Relative Contraindications : <p> arterial lines ( -the transducer must be removed ) <p> surgical staples , ( -ideal to remove ) <p> previous surgery , ( -must be 6-8wks post-op ) <p> tattoos , ( -may experience a heating effect on the skin due to iron oxide ) <p> penile prosthesis , ( -most compatible , indicate type and model ) <p> Items That Would Need to Be Removed : <p> hearing aids <p> purses/wallets <p> eye prosthesis <p> coins <p> any implant held in by a magnet <p> trans-dermal medication patches <p> prosthetic limb <p> metal zippers <p> hair pins/clips <p> jewelry <p> wigs <p> dentures <p> eye glasses <p> CAD pumps <p> Any metallic object can become a projectile within a magnetic field , posing a serious risk of injury to the patient and the technologists . To prevent any possible injuries we ask that all patients change into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a locker . The key can accompany the patient into the room . <p> Information for MRI Patients <p> Registration:On the day of your exam , please arrive at the Diagnostic Imaging Registration desk on time Please be sure to provide a valid Ontario Health Card . <p> Preparation:After the registration in Diagnostic Imaging you will be asked to sit in the MRI waiting room.An MRI technologist will explain the procedure to you and confirm the information provided on the screening form . It is advised that if you plan on taking sedation , that it is taken after you have registered in Diagnostic Imaging . If you are taking sedation , please be sure to have an adult accompany you home.Once the procedure has been explained you will be instructed to change into a hospital gown . Lockers are available to lock up your belongings and valuables . When it is time for your exam a technologist will escort you into the room . <p> Preparation for Specific Exams <p> Type of Exam <p> Preparation <p> Abdominal and Pelvic Exams <p> NPO 4 hrs prior ( nothing to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of water <p> During the Exam:After the exam has been explained to you the technologist will provide you with hearing protection . This protection will help reduce the loud thumping sounds which are produced during the scan.The MR scanner is a large tube shaped magnet with a padded table that moves into the centre of the magnet . The body part being examined will determine if you go into the scanner head or feet first , as well as how far you go in . In most cases equipment called surface coils will be placed on the area we are scanning . The technologist will give you an Emergency call bell to squeeze if you need to get their attention.It is very important that you remain relaxed and very still during the exam . Movement can cause non-diagnostic images and they will need to be repeated . In some abdominal exams we may ask you to hold your breath for up to 20secs while the pictures are acquired.Most exams will take between 30-45 minutes , however there are some that can take up to an hour . Please allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exam.Some exams require an injection of contrast media called gadolinium . It is a colorless fluid that is injected into a vein in your arm . Gadolinium is very safe and the risks will be discussed with you by the technologist . If contrast is required it is important that you remain very still as the images before the injection must match the images obtained after the injection . Once your MRI is completed it will be reviewed by a radiologist and the report will be available to your ordering physician within about 2 weeks . <p> Frequently Asked Questions <p> Q : How does the MRI scanner work ? Your body is composed of small particles called atoms . Most of the body is composed of Hydrogen atoms that under normal circumstances spin around at random . However , when you are placed within a strong magnetic field , the hydrogen atoms line up and spin in the same direction as the magnetic field . When a radio frequency wave is transmitted through the tissues in the body the Hydrogen atoms produce a signal . These signals are measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise in the scanner ? The noise that the scanner creates is the electrical current rising within the wires of the gradient magnet . The current in the wires are opposing the main magnet field ; the stronger the field the louder the gradient noise . <p> Q : Will it hurt ? No . You will not be able to feel the magnetic field . <p> Q : What is the difference between MRI and CT ? Both MRI and CT create cross-sectional images of the body . The main difference is that MRI uses a large magnet and radio waves to produce images where as a CT scanner uses ionizing radiation . <p> Q:Can you scan my entire body while I am in there ? No . The MR scanner can scan almost any part of the body but each scan is limited to a specific area . It can take from 30-60 minutes to scan each area . <p> Q:Why is my whole body in the scanner if you are only scanning my head ? The area of the scanner that creates the images is located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isocentre . Therefore , in order to scan your head most of your upper body will be in the scanner . The same is true when imaging the spine and upper extremities . <p> Q : Does the MRI table have a weight and size limit ? Yes , the table weight limit is 300 lbs.with a maximum width of 60cm . For optimal images it is necessary for the area being examined to be within the magnets isocentre which is located directly in the centre of the scanner .

The patient returns 3 " 4 hours later for the injection of labeled white blood cells . Images may be taken 1 hr. , 3-4 hours , and 24 hours later.The timing of images will vary depending on the patient history.No preparation is necessary . <p> DefinitionNuclear medicine ( also called radionuclide imaging ) uses small amounts of radioactive material to diagnose or treat a variety of diseases , including many types of cancers , heart disease and certain other abnormalities within the body.Nuclear medicine procedures are noninvasive and usually painless medical tests that help physicians diagnose medical conditions . These imaging scans use radioactive materials called radiopharmaceuticals or radiotracers . <p> ProcedureDepending on the type of nuclear medicine exam you are undergoing , the radiotracer is either injected into a vein , swallowed or inhaled as a gas and eventually accumulates in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gives off energy in the form of gamma rays . This energy is detected by a device called a gamma camera or probe . These devices work together with a computer to measure the amount of radiotracer absorbed by your body and to produce special pictures offering details on both the structure and function of organs and tissues . <p> Common UsesPhysicians use these procedures to visualize the structure and function of an organ , tissue , bone or system of the body . <p> How It WorksWith ordinary x-ray examinations , an image is made by passing x-rays through your body from an outside source . In contrast , nuclear medicine procedures use a radioactive material called a radiopharmaceutical , which is injected into your bloodstream , swallowed or inhaled . This radioactive material accumulates in the organ or area of your body being examined , where it gives off a small amount of energy in the form of gamma rays . A gamma camera or probe detects this energy and with the help of a computer creates pictures offering details on both the structure and function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear medicine imaging studies are less directed toward picturing anatomy and structure , and more concerned with depicting physiologic processes within the body , such as rates of metabolism or levels of various other chemical activity . Areas of greater intensity , called " hot spots " , indicate where large amounts of the radiotracer have accumulated and where there is a high level of chemical activity . Less intense areas , or " cold spots " , indicate a smaller concentration of radiotracer and less chemical activity.In radioactive iodine ( I-131 ) therapy , radioactive iodine ( I-131 ) is swallowed , absorbed into the bloodstream in the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract and concentrated from the blood by the thyroid gland where it destroys cells within that organ . <p> How the procedure is performedNuclear medicine imaging is usually performed on an outpatient basis , but is often performed on hospitalized patients as well.You will be positioned on an examination table . If necessary , a technologist will insert an intravenous ( IV ) line into a vein in your hand or arm.Depending on the type of nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then injected intravenously , swallowed or inhaled.It can take anywhere from several seconds to several days for the radiopharmaceutical to travel through your body and accumulate in the organ or area being studied . As a result , imaging may be done immediately , a few hours later , or even several days after you have received the radioactive material . <p> How prepare for the test <p> You may be asked to wear a gown during the exam or you may be allowed to wear your own clothing . <p> Women should always inform their physician or technologist if there is any possibility that they are pregnant or if they are breastfeeding their baby . <p> You should inform your physician and the technologist performing your exam of any medications you are taking , including vitamins and herbal supplements . <p> You should also inform them if you have any allergies and about recent illnesses or other medical conditions . <p> Jewelry and other metallic accessories should be left at home if possible or removed prior to the exam because they may interfere with the procedure . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scan you are undergoing . <p> During the Procedure <p> When it is time for the imaging to begin , the gamma camera will take a series of images . <p> The camera may rotate around you or it may stay in one position and you will be asked to change positions in between images . <p> While the camera is taking pictures , you will need to remain still for brief periods of time . It is important that you remain still while the images are being recorded . <p> In some cases , the camera may move very close to your body . This is necessary to obtain the best quality images . <p> If you are claustrophobic , you should inform the technologist before your exam begins . <p> The length of time for nuclear medicine procedures varies greatly , depending on the type of exam . Actual scanning time for nuclear imaging exams can take from 20 minutes to several hours and may be conducted over several days . <p> After the ProcedureWhen the examination is completed , you may be asked to wait until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Occasionally , more images are obtained for clarification or better visualization of certain areas or structures . The need for additional images does not necessarily mean there was a problem with the exam or that something abnormal was found , and should not be a cause of concern for you . You will not be exposed to more radiation during this process.If you had an intravenous line inserted for the procedure , it will be removed.During radioactive iodine ( I-131 ) therapy , which is most often an inpatient procedure , the radioactive iodine is swallowed in capsule form . <p> What will I experience during and after the procedureMost nuclear medicine procedures are painless and are rarely associated with significant discomfort or side effects.If the radiotracer is given intravenously , you will feel a slight pin prick when the needle is inserted into your vein for the intravenous line . When the radioactive material is injected into your arm , you may feel a cold sensation moving up your arm , but there are generally no other side effects.When swallowed , the radiotracer has little or no taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when breathing room air or holding your breath.With some procedures , a catheter may be placed into your bladder , which may cause temporary discomfort . Though nuclear imaging itself causes no pain , there may be some discomfort from having to remain still or to stay in one particular position during imaging.Unless your physician tells you otherwise , you may resume your normal activities after your nuclear medicine scan . If any special instructions are necessary , you will be informed by a technologist before you leave the nuclear medicine department . <p> Radioactive MaterialThrough the natural process of radioactive decay , the small amount of radiopharmaceutical in your body will lose its radioactivity over time . It may also pass out of your body through your urine or stool during the first few hours or days following the test . You may be instructed to take special precautions after urinating , to flush the toilet twice and to wash your hands thoroughly . You should also drink plenty of water to help flush the radioactive material out of your body as instructed by the nuclear medicine personnel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test that helps physicians diagnose and treat medical conditions .. Imaging with x-rays involves exposing a part of the body to a small dose of ionizing radiation to produce pictures of the inside of the body . X-rays are the oldest and most frequently used form of medical imaging . <p> How does the procedure work ? X-rays are a form of radiation like light or radio waves . X-rays pass through most objects , including the body . Once it is carefully aimed at the part of the body being examined , an x-ray machine produces a small burst of radiation that passes through the body , recording an image on photographic film or a special digital image recording plate.Different parts of the body absorb the x-rays in varying degrees . Dense bone absorbs much of the radiation while soft tissue , such as muscle , fat and organs , allow more of the x-rays to pass through them . As a result , bones appear white on the x-ray , soft tissue shows up in shades of gray and air appears black.For example , on a chest x-ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation and appear white or light gray on the image . Lung tissue absorbs little radiation and will appear dark on the image . Until recently , x-ray images were maintained as hard film copy ( much like a photographic negative ) . Today , most images are digital files that are stored electronically . These stored images are easily accessible and are sometimes compared to current x-ray images for diagnosis and disease management . <p> Before the Exam <p> You may be asked to remove some or all of your clothes and to wear a gown during the exam . <p> You may also be asked to remove jewelry , eye glasses and any metal objects or clothing that might interfere with the x-ray images . <p> Women should always inform their physician or x-ray technologist if there is any possibility that they are pregnant . Many imaging tests are not performed during pregnancy so as not to expose the fetus to radiation . If an x-ray is necessary , precautions will be taken to minimize radiation exposure to the baby . <p> During the Exam <p> Depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie on an examination table , sit on a stool or stand . <p> The technologist , an individual specially trained to perform radiology examinations , will position the patient to best demonstrate the area to be examined . <p> You must hold very still and may be asked to keep from breathing for a few seconds while the x-ray picture is taken to reduce the possibility of a blurred image . <p> The technologist will walk behind a wall or into the next room to activate the x-ray machine . <p> After the ExamWhen the examination is complete , you will be asked to wait until the radiologist determines that all the necessary images have been obtained.The examination is usually completed within 15 - 30 minutes . <p> What will I experience during and after the procedure ?

This includes the right or ascending colon , the transverse colon , the left or descending colon , sigmoid colon and the rectum . The appendix and a portion of the distal small intestine may also be included.An x-ray ( radiograph ) is a noninvasive medical test that helps physicians diagnose and treat medical conditions . Imaging with x-rays involves exposing a part of the body to a small dose of ionizing radiation to produce pictures of the inside of the body . X-rays are the oldest and most frequently used form of medical imaging.The lower GI uses a special form of x-ray called fluoroscopy and a contrast material called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see internal organs in motion . When the lower gastrointestinal tract is filled with barium , the radiologist is able to view and assess the anatomy and function of the rectum , colon and sometimes part of the lower small intestine . <p> Common UsesA physician may order a lower GI examination to detect : <p> benign tumors ( such as polyps ) . <p> cancer . <p> causes of other intestinal illnesses . <p> The procedure is frequently performed to help diagnose symptoms such as : <p> chronic diarrhea . <p> blood in stools . <p> constipation . <p> irritable bowel syndrome . <p> unexplained weight loss . <p> a change in bowel habits . <p> suspected blood loss . <p> abdominal pain . <p> Images of the small bowel and colon are also used to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease , a group of disorders that includes Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis . <p> Before the Procedure <p> Inform your physician of any medications you are taking and if you have any allergies , especially to barium or iodinated contrast materials . <p> On the day before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink only clear liquids like juice , tea , black coffee , cola or broth , and to avoid dairy products . <p> After midnight , you should not eat or drink anything . <p> You must take a laxative ( in either pill or liquid form ) and use an over-the-counter enema preparation the night before the exam and possibly a few hours before the procedure . Just follow your doctor 's instructions . <p> You can take your usual prescribed oral medications with limited amounts of water . <p> During the Procedure <p> You will be asked to remove some or all of your clothes and to wear a gown . <p> You will also be asked to remove jewelry , eye glasses and any metal objects or clothing that might interfere with the x-ray images . <p> Women should always inform their physician or x-ray technologist if there is any possibility that they are pregnant .

Air may also be injected through the tube to help the barium thoroughly coat the lining of the colon . In some circumstances , the radiologist or referring physician may prefer a water and iodine solution rather than barium . Next , a series of x-ray images is taken.You must hold very still and may be asked to keep from breathing for a few seconds while the x-ray picture is taken to reduce the possibility of a blurred image . The technologist will walk behind a wall or into the next room to activate the x-ray machineThe patient may be repositioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the examination is complete , you will be asked to wait until the radiologist determines that all the necessary images have been obtained.Once the x-ray images are completed , most of the barium will be emptied through the tube . The patient will then expel the remaining barium and air in the restroom . In some cases , the additional x-ray images will be taken.A barium enema is usually completed within 30 to 60 minutes . <p> What will I experience during and after the procedure ? As the barium fills your colon , you will feel the need to move your bowel . You may feel abdominal pressure or even minor cramping . Most people tolerate the mild discomfort easily . The tip of the enema tube is specially designed to help you hold in the barium . If you are having trouble , let the technologist know.During the imaging process , you will be asked to turn from side to side and to hold several different positions . At times , pressure may be applied to your abdomen . With air contrast studies of the bowel ( air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an upright position.After the examination you can resume a regular diet and take orally administered medications unless told otherwise by your doctor . You will be encouraged to drink additional water for 24 hours after the examination.Your stools may appear white for a day or so as your body clears the barium liquid from your system . Some people experience constipation after a barium enema . If you do not have a bowel movement for more than two days after your exam or are unable to pass gas rectally , call your physician promptly . You may need an enema or laxative to assist in eliminating the barium . <h> Upper GI Exam <p> Definition <p> An upper gastrointestinal tract radiography , also called an upper GI exam , is an x-ray examination of the pharynx , esophagus , stomach and first part of the small intestine ( also known as the duodenum ) that uses a special form of x-ray called fluoroscopy and an orally ingested contrast material called barium.An x-ray ( radiograph ) is a noninvasive medical test that helps physicians diagnose and treat medical conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a small dose of ionizing radiation to produce pictures of the inside of the body . X-rays are the oldest and most frequently used form of medical imaging.Fluoroscopy makes it possible to see internal organs in motion . When the upper GI tract is coated with barium , the radiologist is able to view and assess the anatomy and function of the esophagus , stomach and duodenum.An x-ray examination that evaluates only the pharynx and esophagus is called a barium swallow.In addition to drinking barium , some patients are also given baking-soda crystals ( similar to Alka-Seltzer ) to further improve the images . This procedure is called an air-contrast or double-contrast upper GI . <p> Inform your physician of any medications you are taking and if you have any allergies , especially to barium or iodinated contrast materials . Also inform your doctor about recent illnesses or other medical conditions . <p> Women should always inform their physician or x-ray technologist if there is any possibility that they are pregnant . Many imaging tests are not performed during pregnancy so as not to expose the fetus to radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to minimize radiation exposure to the baby . To ensure the best possible image quality , your stomach must be empty of food . Therefore , you must not to eat or drink anything ( including any medications taken by mouth , especially antacids ) and to refrain from chewing gum and smoking after midnight on the day of the examination . <p> You may be asked to remove some or all of your clothes and to wear a gown during the exam . You may also be asked to remove jewelry , eye glasses and any metal objects or clothing that might interfere with the x-ray images . <p> How is the procedure performed ? This examination is usually performed on an outpatient basis and is often scheduled in the morning to reduce the patient 's fasting time.A radiological technologist and a radiologist , a physician specifically trained to supervise and interpret radiology examinations , guide the patient through the upper GI series.As the patient drinks the liquid barium , which resembles a light-colored milkshake , the radiologist will watch the barium pass through the patient 's digestive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images in a movie-like sequence onto a monitor . The exam table will be positioned at different angles and the patient 's abdomen may be compressed to help spread the barium . Once the upper GI tract is adequately coated with the barium , still x-ray images will be taken and stored for further review.The patient will be asked to hold very still and may be asked to keep from breathing for a few seconds while the x-ray picture is taken to reduce the possibility of a blurred image.For a double-contrast upper GI series , the patient will swallow baking-soda crystals that create gas in the stomach while additional x-rays are takenWhen the examination is complete , you will be asked to wait until the radiologist determines that all the necessary images have been obtained.This exam is usually completed within 20 minutes . <p> A referral is required from your physician in order to book an appointment for an Ultrasound . <p> An appointment can be made by calling the Imaging booking desk .

The machine sends out high-frequency sound waves , which reflect off body structures . A computer receives these reflected waves and uses them to create a picture . Unlike with an x-ray , there is no ionizing radiation exposure with this test.The test is done in the ultrasound department . You will be lying down for the procedure . A clear , water-based conducting gel is applied to the skin over the area being examined to help with the transmission of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then moved over the area being examined . You may be asked to change position so that other areas can be examined . <p> Before Your TestPreparation for the procedure will depend on the body region being examined . You will be given instructions prior to your test . <p> During the TestThere is generally little discomfort with ultrasound procedures . The conducting gel may feel slightly cold and wet . <p> Why the test is performedThe reason for the examination will depend on your condition or symptoms .

Doppler ultrasound records sound waves reflecting off moving objects , such as blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they flow . <p> There are different types of duplex ultrasound exams . Some include : <p> Arterial and venous duplex ultrasound of the abdomen : examines blood vessels and blood flow in the abdominal area . <p> Carotid duplex ultrasound : looks at the carotid artery in the neck . <p> Duplex ultrasound of the extremities : looks at the arms or legs . <p> Renal duplex ultrasound : examines the kidneys and their blood vessels . <p> A computer measures how the sound waves reflect back , and changes the sound waves into pictures . The Doppler creates a " swishing " sound , which is the sound of your blood moving through the arteries and veins . <p> Ankle Brachial IndexSometimes during a duplex ultrasound , the health care provider may calculate an ankle-brachial ( ABI ) index . You will need to wear blood pressure cuffs on your arms and legs for this test.The ABI number is obtained by dividing the blood pressure in the ankle by the blood pressure in the arm . A value of 0.9 or greater is normal .
