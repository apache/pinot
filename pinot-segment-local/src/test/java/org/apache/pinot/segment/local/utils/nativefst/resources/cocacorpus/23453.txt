Monumental in scale , the sculptural portraits capture the distinct likenesses of these extraordinary heroines of both past and present whose equally monumental contributions , resolve and courageous spirit continue to play an integral role in shaping the lives of Savannahians . <p> Although the portraits are executed in classic bas-relief a style of portraiture perfected by the ancient Greeks Porten used advanced and highly specialized tools and software to sculpturally render each womans visage , infusing a classic medium with modern technology . Using a 3-D modeling program and a computer-controlled lathe , each likeness was hewn into poplar , then carved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraits were then coated in an antiqued , gilded finish , forever preserving each womans image in a larger-than-life golden cameo . <p> The color of the works is most appropriate , as gold traditionally represents generosity and compassion , and it is the mark of benevolent patrons and those who share wisdom , knowledge and wealth with others . <p> Porten was born in Indianapolis , Indiana , in 1982 . Through sculptural works and paintings , he has carved an aesthetic niche of his own , with inspiration often pulled from contemporary pop culture and iconography . He currently lives and works in Savannah .

Laric is known for diffusing the boundaries between technological , legal , archaeological and artistic fields through different media like sculpture and video . In his research-oriented practice , Laric evinces the layers of mediation between a sculpture , a story or an image , and the subsequent versions it generates as it is digested in time , perception and economy . <p> Since anyone with a smartphone has become an accelerated source of image production , distribution and alteration , the questions posed by the artist about the futility of authorship are increasingly urgent . Laric 's claim that we understand visual culture as something unstable , continuously under construction and ever negotiating between the human and the non-human , challenges most fields in contemporary life . <p> The exhibition is a specific reading of Laric 's recent video work . In the first part of the Experimental Gallery , there are two synchronized videos , projecting updated cuts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Versions " is an ongoing essayistic project that juxtaposes recurrent and recirculated image sequences working as vignettes in combination with the voice-over of an actress emulating the robotic sound of text-to-speech software . In her narration , the voice uses extracts from texts by Henry James , Gertrude Stein , Jorge Luis Borges , Bruce Lee and James Brown , by way of Lyn Collins , Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock . The second part of the gallery features an updated cut of " Untitled , " perhaps Laric 's most iconic work to date . In this video , Laric draws on animation from different times to create a concatenation of morphing characters , body parts , furniture , monsters and so on . The animation sequence is interrupted by 3-D modeled anthropomorphic machines and tools , and occasionally images that are being digitally constructed . The soundtrack , specifically designed for the piece , oscillates from melancholic piano compositions to low frequency buzzing notes to complete each vignette . <p> For Laric , there is no definitive means of categorization or purity in the realm of images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precursor before we experience the source .

The unlikely artifact speaks to the rich and complex connections between trade and the built environment . While its journey from being a tombstone in 18th-century China to a lowly piece of pavement in mid-19th-century Savannah , ultimately becoming an object of reverence under glass in the 21st century may be unique , it aptly stands for the kind of global trade that has directly shaped cities throughout history and around the world . <p> Carved into the stone are two sets of Chinese characters . The smaller characters to the right tell us that it was carved in the third year of the reign of Emperor Jiaqing of the Qing dynasty ( 1796-1820 ) hence 1798 . The three larger characters to the left identify a name : Zhang Linan . The combination of a name and a date indicates that this stone was used as a tombstone . <p> At some point during the first half of the 19th century , the tombstone lost its value and became a piece of rubble placed in a ships hold as ballast , weight in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock for ships ballast had been a common practice for centuries . At the time , ships arrived in Savannah comparatively empty prior to being loaded with heavy bales of cotton for export . To make more room for outgoing cargo , the ballast stones would be deposited on the waterfront , a practice common in American port cities . <p> Used in older American cities by the time of the American Revolution , these naturally rounded and irregular cobblestones proved to be the first successful permanent pavement widely utilized in Savannah . Beginning by 1843 , the city enthusiastically embraced the material , even though it was viewed poorly by at least one mid-19th-century pavement expert . <p> William Gillespie , a professor of civil engineering at Union College in Schenectady , New York , criticized this type of pavement in his 1847 manual as a " common but very inferior pavement , which disgraces the streets of nearly all our cities . " The city of Savannah enjoyed a steady supply of the stones from discarded ballast emptied onto the citys wharfs by incoming ships . Until 1880 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this material each year , which cost only a " wharfage " fee since the wharfs were privately owned . <p> Between 1855 and 1858 , the ramps leading down the bluff from Bay Street to River Street were paved with cobblestones , while the adjacent retaining walls were exquisitely constructed by Irish stone mason Michael Cash with recycled pieces of masonry , documented by small relief plaques . <p> During the Civil War , according to the 1866 Municipal Report issued by the mayors office , the ramps " were entirely destroyed and the material carried away and sunk in the obstructions " in the river . Rebuilding with new cobblestones and masonry , also by Cash , concluded a year later . All or parts of 13 streets in Savannah were paved with cobblestones before the ready supply diminished in the early 1880s following a new requirement for ballast to be unloaded outside the city . <p> The Chinese cobblestone may have been used as pavement in Savannah as early as 1843 or as late as 1880 , gracing the bottom of Whitaker Street ramp , immediately east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 , a public works crew repaired the ramp , which entailed removing the historic cobblestones and patching the roadway with concrete stamped with a cobblestone pattern . The Chinese cobblestone went missing , to the consternation of area historians , but was ultimately tracked down by City of Savannah archivist Luciana Spracher . She had the stone cleaned , documented and translated prior to placing it on display in a glass showcase in the City Hall council chamber . For the benefit of symposium attendees , the stone is on display in the City Hall first floor rotunda Feb. 4-6 . <h> The Savannah Symposium : A look back <p> In February 1999 , SCADs architectural history department sponsored the Savannah Symposium on the City Square , a three-day forum for scholarship and discussion about an important theme in architectural and urban history with direct relevance to the city of Savannah and contemporary practice in the building arts . <p> That symposium earned SCAD its first-ever outside humanities grant from the Georgia Humanities Council and the Samuel Kress Foundation and paved the way for many more grants and outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year of success led to development of the symposium as a biennial event intended to stimulate interdisciplinary dialogue among scholars , urban designers , regional and local community leaders , faculty and students on a topic that has relevance to both historical and current affairs . <h> The Savannah Symposium on the City Square <p> Feb. 25-27 , 1999 <p> Directed by David Gobel , Ph.D. , and Robin Williams , Ph.D . <p> Keynote speakers : <p> Marvin Trachtenberg , professor of architecture , Institute of Fine Arts , New York University <p> Carroll William Westfall , professor of architecture , University of Notre Dame <p> Robert Glover , director of urban design , City of Toronto <p> Stefanos Polyzoides , partner , Moule &amp; Polyzoides Architects <p> Public life in America at the end of the second millennium seems to be characterized increasingly by its placelessness .

Ours is a " culture of authenticity , " according to Charles Taylor . " To thine own self be true " has become the motto of a society in search of the authentic self . It is not surprising , therefore , to hear authenticity as an incessant refrain applied to contemporary architectural criticism . In the architecture columns of The New York Times , The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times , authenticity has replaced the Vitruvian triad of firmness , commodity and delight as the primary standard of judgment . Likewise , when debates arise regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a community , the question often becomes , " Which is more authentic ? " <p> Dell Upton , professor of architectural history , University of Virginia <p> Acts of commemoration are fundamental to human experience and fundamental to the act of building . In fact , it can be argued that the building of cities itself is a radically commemorative activity . " Come let us make a name for ourselves , " said the builders of Babel . Commemoration lies at the poetic , historiographic and social heart of human community . It is how societies define themselves . Individuals memorize , remember or ponder the past ; communities commemorate . Collective memory is , however , an invitation to controversy and contention . <p> We begin with the simple proposition that architecture is inevitably regional . While globalizing trends alter or create entirely new regions , regional identities remain . The symposium explored the ways in which regionalism has been and continues to be defined and redefined .

The calculation uses the number of calendar days in the quarter between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attendance divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter minus any breaks of 5 days or more ( calendar days completed/total calendar days in the term = percent earned ) to determine how much financial aid the student has earned for the quarter . After the calculation is completed , the unearned portion must be returned to the appropriate financial aid program(s) according to federal and state regulations . This process takes place as soon as possible and unearned funds are returned no later than 45 days after the date of determination of withdrawal . Students who withdraw ( officially or unofficially ) after completing 60 percent of the quarter earn 100 percent of their financial aid for the quarter and no Title IV funds are returned . <p> After the calculation is completed , the appropriate adjustments ( if any ) are made to the student 's financial aid awards and student account .

Any loan funds that must be returned are returned in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Master Promissory Note . Any amount of unearned grant funds that must be returned is called an overpayment . The maximum amount of a grant overpayment due to be repaid by the student is any amount of the grant overpayment that is in excess of 50 percent of the amount of grant(s) received .
