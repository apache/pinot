@@96829372 @1029372/ <p> Earlier this year we also said that we want a million new members in 2017 and with that in mind , it 's really important that first-time users can register as easily as possible . That 's why , in our last sprint , the Membership website team focused on improving the user journey and reducing drop-outs . <h> Completing the online registration <p> To get an online member account you have to register on the Membership site . If you 're already a member then it 's a case of registering your card ( or temporary card ) you bought in store . <p> When we looked at data , only 34% of people who started to sign up as new members , ie those who had n't got any kind of membership card from coop.co.uk/membership were completing the journey . Improving things for this user group is key to achieving our target of a million new members this year . Someone signing up here is potentially a new member that we might never see again if they leave the site at this point . <h> Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we were losing a significant number of people at the point where we asked new members to pay -1 . At first we assumed that paying -1 was too much for some customers . But the 34% successful sign up rate did n't match well with what we were hearing from users we 'd talked to . We found that although some people questioned why we charge -1 , their reactions did n't indicate that a massive 2 out of every 3 of them would be put off by it . <p> From this , we hypothesised that the poor conversion rate might be down to people who were already members arriving at the -1 payment page . They would have already paid to join , so they could be the ones leaving at this point . <p> There are over a quarter of a million members with temporary cards who have n't registered them yet . We know that after 28 days the chances of a card being registered falls dramatically so designing a user journey that helps temporary card holders succeed first time and become active ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To solve this we added in another step into the process for anyone wanting to join as a new member . The important interaction change we made was to ask the customer if they had a Co-op card , rather than asking them to remember if they were already members.We included images of the old honeycomb ' card , the new blue card as well as an image of a temporary card as visual prompts . From there , if they have a card we take their membership number and direct them to sign in or register . Now , they do n't see a screen asking them for another -1 . We only let people who say they do n't have a card progress further . <h> It 's working <p> Our latest data shows that 58% people who are routed to join follow this journey successfully : they pay -1 and become members .

What is the successful conversion rate now , when someone goes online to register a temporary card , and how does that compare to what has it been in the last 6 months ? It is important not to call people with temporary cards members , because they have no membership rights eg voting until they have signed up as a member . We do n't  even know their name if they only have a temporary card . <p> Hi Mike very interested in this piece of work and I will email you , perhaps you could keep me and Frank updated together to save yourself time .

And the CTM who sold it her spent a lot of time explaining etc and we offered to phone for her in store once she had bought it but she was by now anxious and refused . My point is that a ) the concept of selling a temporary card and expecting conversions has serious flaws and 2 ) that there are huge training and time management issues around selling them at POS . But I am glad to see you tidying up the digital journey for those prepared to take it . <p> Barbara Recognising the low tech profile of some temporary cardholders and holding one myself , perhaps the appropriate vehicle for getting what 's needed for a temporary cardholder to progress through to membership when using their temporary card for a second or third time would be to ask them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues in store or funeral home can then forward to the centre for processing ?

Look forward to hearing from you . Have a nice weekend . Frank <p> June I can see the sense in what you are suggesting here in that we would remove the barrier to joining of not having to pay up front but , personally , I am very supportive of asking shoppers to pay -1 to start the " journey/pilgrimage " to becoming a fully participative member-owner . Firstly , having to pay -1 up front differentiates our membership proposition from those run by other retailers ( Nectar , Tesco , M&amp;S etc . ) Secondly and very importantly ( for me anyway ) it also provides an opportunity upfront at the very start of the Member " journey/pilgrimage " experience to give solid expression to the concept of owner-membership i.e. the -1 buys you a share in our Co-op* . Having struggled for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member owner proposition particularly since CWS closed down the Member Shares &amp; Loans function under pressure from the regulator concerned at the prospects for money laundering through those accounts I was pleased to see the member share feature in the new recruitment/enrolment material . Perhaps the choice of words used in the recruitment material might be improved as referring to the -1 being used to buy " a share " gives the impression one can " buy more than one share " ? Perhaps , in that context and for the avoidance of doubt , the text string " a share " should be replaced with " your share " to align to the second co-op principle and the " equal voice " theme expressed therein . Does any of this persuade you into a different view on the -1 ? Regards Frank <p> I understand and sympathise with what you are saying but how many of our members view their membership as a pilgrimage ? It is my belief that members join for economic reasons . The poor voting figures at the AGM supports this view . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never be achieved . However your answer does make me want an answer to the question Why are we having a membership drive ? the cynic in me thinks it is to raise -1 million <p> June Apologies for the use of the word " pilgrimage " . it was ( what I thought obviously wrongly ) a clever aside to that word being suggested at the Council Renewal session last Saturday where " pilgrimage " was offered as a replacement for " journey " in the context of the " shopper to engaged member journey " . Regarding your second point . while I agree that the major motivation for a shopper to become a member is economic ( i.e. to get through to the 5%:1% they are , initially , willing to pay -1 and later register their personal details ) there are many subsequent steps that members can take to progress along the engaged membership journey/spectrum short of voting at an AGM . For example ; a minority of members will opt in to receiving marketing/community messages ( my preference would be they opt out not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their membership card for swiping ( important that temporary card use is used at Point of Payment as a trigger for a conversation ) and a smaller but still significant number of members will want to choose which local cause they want to receive their 1% ( to accommodate the very many members without a PC , iPad or smartphone I can not understand why choosing can not be done by phone ) Regarding your final point : based on all I 've heard an seen at Council , Co-op Blogs etc. , I 'm very confident personally that recruiting 1m members in 2017 is motivated for commercial reasons ( consumers who trade and then become members are more likely to trade with us more ) , co-operative reasons ( the more members we have the stronger our co-op ) and community reasons ( the more members we have the deeper our relationship with the communities in which we trade ) all of which make us a more successful and sustainable co-op . As for the -1 million proceeds raised it is not being done to raise either revenue or capital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then go on either not to register or register and do no further trade over a period of 3 years will , as signalled in the membership enrolment material , have their -1s shared with charitable causes . Hope this helps ? Frank <p> June I assume that decision will be made cSeptember 2020 in the run up to the Third Anniversary of the launch of the new membership scheme when the first unregistered and never active membership records will be deleted from the membership database/member register and their associated -1s distributed to good charitable causes . I expect the -1s held in respect of members on the register who are active will be treated in the same way as the -1s retained under the previous scheme and held alongside legacy loan and share capital* Regards Frank *Of which I think there is still c-25 held in my name since 1974 from my time as a member of Liverpool Co-op which merged with CRS in the early 80s which itself merged with CWS in 2000 to form tCG . <p> Frank , I think I may have misunderstood your reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money which will go to charity . Therefore if there are a million new members this becomes a -1 million of capital . My understanding is that this money can be used commercially and will be accounted as share capital . June <p> June Yes my understanding is " One pounds " collected from members who fail to register gets distributed to charity after 3 years . " One pounds " collected from members who register will be treated as capital . As my understanding is based on past practice.if you want certainty send a question to the Council Secretary or ask Mike when we teleconference . Cheers Frank

@@96829383 @1029383/ <p> Opening up some of our data will help us meet our customers ' and members needs better and help us play a bigger part in their lives and their communities . <p> By opening up ' , we do n't mean we 're about to start selling our customer or member data , we mean we 're starting to build a platform that makes our data more accurate and makes some of it ( not confidential stuff , of course ) easier to access . This is really important because teams will be able to build useful things more easily . <p> We started building our platform by looking at our location data for our food stores and funeral homes . This is the addresses , the coordinates and associated information which includes things like opening hours , facilities and directions . <p> It 's important that the data for each store or funeral home is both accurate- and easy to access . Here 's what we 've been doing to make sure it is . <h> Making sure its accurate <p> We put a feedback form on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accurate or not . <p> We learnt- that our latitude and longitude co-ordinates were showing many stores in the wrong place on the map . We also found out- through user feedback that many stores had the wrong opening hours and some of the facilities needed updating too . Each one of these things needed to be accurate to meet the main user needs of a store finder . <p> To make things better , we put some tactical fixes in place to make the data more reliable . It 's actually just a temporary measure while the Food team undertakes the huge challenge of rebuilding how it manages , stores and maintains its data . So , right now the accuracy is better but there is still much more to do . <p> Earlier this month we released a new version of the funeral home finder . We 're hoping that the feedback form on there will help us quickly uncover any inaccuracies with our data like- it did with the store finder . Of course , - we might find that users are less compelled to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait and see and make changes if we need to . <h> Making data easier to access with APIs <p> We built the store finder in such a way that it uses an Application Programme Interface ( API ) . APIs turn webpages from static words and pictures to dynamic , contextual information sources by connecting them with databases . Mulesoft explains APIs well in an- online video . <p> For us , creating APIs is the first step in making our data easy to access and open because it provides a widely understood way for developers to quickly start building things that use our data . We chose to build a . JSON API as it 's a machine readable format that is also quite readable for us humans too . <p> Now , both internal and external developers can build their own services and interfaces featuring Co-op location data . Co-op Digital teams have used the Location Services ' API to build a product finder , the Membership team have used it to create prototypes to test and of course , we have re-used it for the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with our internal teams to learn the best ways to build and support APIs . <h> Not just for Co-op teams <p> Fair Tax Mark is our first external user who has used the API for its Fair Tax Map . From this , we 're learning how to support and improve the API for third parties . <h> We 've got plans <p> Well continue to collect , prioritise and build requests for new features , as well as helping wherever we can to improve how the data is kept up to date within the business . We 're also working with a cross-team bunch of engineers and developers to agree a common set of principles and standards , so that our APIs are consistently easy to access . Were experimenting with how we can make them easy to find in one place , where non-developers can see what 's available and developers can get quickly get their hands on our data . <p> We 've had a play with Swagger , a popular open source framework for presenting APIs . <p> Its basic but the intention is that well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content . So it might look a bit like this . <p> Its also likely that well introduce access keys to help us support users better and ensure that we can manage demand . <p> These- are all good first steps for the Location Services team. - If you have thoughts on this stuff , leave a comment below . We 're particularly interested to hear ideas on how you could use Co-op Data . <p> Have you given any thought as to which open licence you 'll be using to make the data open ? Its often a stumbling block for many organisations , so useful to address early alongside exploring how to improve access .

@@96829422 @1029422/ <p> Since April 2016 , the Funeralcare team at Co-op Digital has been working to make life easier for our colleagues at our funeral homes across the UK . Our aim has always been to reduce the time our colleagues spend juggling and filling in paper forms so that they can spend more time with their clients people who are grieving for their loved ones . <p> a first call ' service that logs details of a death and automatically alerts an ambulance team by SMS to take the deceased into our care <p> a funeral arrangement service which captures the client 's decisions , the costs , and keeps colleagues in various locations from funeral homes and the central care centre updated <p> a hearse booking system , staff diary and staff assignment service <p> a coffin stock control system , and a way for clients to browse the existing coffin range <p> an audit system that captures certain steps in the service <p> Since then we 've been busy testing with colleagues and iterating . <h> We 've added new features <p> As we 've learnt where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new features . They include a digital mortuary register and a digital belongings log to record possessions . <p> Deceased can come into our colleagues ' care at any time of the day or night and it 's vital the funeral director knows where that person has been taken . To help , we 've developed a digital mortuary register so that ambulance staff can book the deceased in and the funeral director can see where the person has been taken . <p> Another new feature is a digital belongings log . Often , when someone is brought into our care they 'll have jewellery on them or other personal belongings with them . This means that when a funeral director at a funeral home gets a call from the grieving family to check up on jewellery , they do n't immediately know what the deceased came in with because the paper record is with the deceased at the mortuary . To make this easier and more efficient , we introduced a digital log instead of needing multiple phone calls between different locations . - <h> Live trial and user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to November we continued to visit funeral homes all over the country to observe how colleagues work but we were also doing usability testing on each of the individual features in the bulleted list above with colleagues in mock labs . We tested and improved each feature separately until we thought we 'd built enough of a service to be valuable to colleagues . At that point , in December , we rolled out a beta trial in Bolton . <p> We asked colleagues in Bolton to use the service in parallel with their current process which involves whiteboards , post-its , paper diaries , fax machines and the old , often painful-to-use software . Letting them use it for real is the best way to learn what 's working and what 's not . It drew our attention to 3 major things we 'd overlooked during usability testing . <p> We thought we were being helpful by preloading the local churches and crematoriums but we had n't given colleagues the option to create new ones . <p> We found that the calendar could n't cope with all day events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so having restricted access for specific roles creates a problem if someone is off i 'll and cover is needed . <p> Testing the beta with a small number of colleagues helped us catch problems like these before we rolled the service out to more people . <h> Trialling the service in Edinburgh <p> We want our service to be useful everywhere but we 've been told many times by colleagues that there 's no such thing as a typical ' funeral . They vary from region to region for reasons including local traditions , operational set up , affluence , traffic as well as legislation . Because our aim is to give time back to colleagues so they can spend it with their customers , we need to create something that works for all users not just our colleagues in Bolton . That 's why we are launching our at-need funeral service trial in Edinburgh in March . <h> We 're still learning <p> The beta has shown us that funeral arrangements are made up of multiple interactions like choosing flowers , booking venues and signing off obituary notices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , so iterating the design is the only way we can cope with all the new things we keep learning . <p> We know that standard software packages do n't solve every problem . By involving colleagues throughout we 're building something that meets their needs and will improve things for both colleagues and their customers . <p> We 're transforming the Co-op Funeralcare business but we believe that what we 're doing here will actually help transform the entire industry . To help us do this , Co-op Digital is working towards having a dedicated digital product teams within the Co-op Funeralcare business . <p> If that sounds like something you 'd like to help with we 're looking for an agile delivery manager and a product manager . <p> Come to a talk about the digital transformation of our Funeralcare business on 28 March .

In particular , if you have a concern about bullying or harassment at work and are unable to discuss this with your line manager , you should raise this immediately with a more senior manager . <p> If you have any questions about the application of this procedure , you should speak to your manager . <h> The Procedure <h> Discuss the issue with your manager <p> If you have a complaint about something relating to your work or working environment , you should raise this informally with your line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in confidence , where necessary will discretely investigate your complaint , and will attempt to resolve the issue as speedily as possible . If it is inappropriate to raise this particular complaint with your manager , you may instead progress to the next level of grievance as set out below . <p> Although there is no specific right to be accompanied to an informal grievance meeting , this will always be allowed if you request it and your chosen representative ( either a work colleague or a trade union representative ) is readily available . <h> Make a complaint in writing <p> If you are not satisfied with the outcome presented to you by your manager , or if you do not feel that it is appropriate to raise the complaint informally , you should make a formal complaint in writing to the next level of management . You should set out in your letter the nature of the complaint , including as much detail as possible , for example , dates and names of people involved . <h> Attend a meeting <p> You will be invited to a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of the receipt of your letter , apart from in exceptional circumstances . You should come to this meeting prepared to discuss your concerns as fully as possible to allow for a thorough investigation to be conducted . <p> You will have the right to be accompanied to this meeting by a trade union representative or a work colleague ; if you are under 18 , you may choose to be accompanied by a parent or guardian . If you are a member of a trade union , you may wish to discuss your grievance with them , even if you do not wish to be accompanied to the meeting . <p> If you are a trade union representative you may choose to be accompanied to the meeting by an Area Organiser or full-time trade union official . Unless you tell the manager otherwise , he or she will contact a full-time official of your trade union to explain the nature of your grievance . <p> During the meeting the manager will discuss your complaint with you and ask questions to ensure that they have as full an understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your complaint , which may include interviewing work colleagues , but will ensure that your grievance remains confidential as far as is possible . <h> The response <p> Following a thorough investigation the manager will write to you to confirm the outcome of your grievance and explain any changes that he or she has put in place to resolve the issue . This will normally be within 10 days of the grievance meeting but if it is likely to take longer the manager will contact you to explain . <h> The appeal <p> If you are unhappy with the outcome of your grievance , you may appeal to the next level of management , within five working days of receiving the outcome letter . You should set out in writing your reasons for appealing and why you are not satisfied with the proposed resolution . <p> You will be invited to a meeting to discuss your appeal , with an independent manager who has not previously been involved in your complaint . You have the right to be accompanied to this meeting by a trade union representative or a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate your concerns and will write to you as soon as is reasonably practical , to confirm his or her decision and any measures that he or she has put in place to resolve the issue . This will exhaust the appeals process . <h> Trade Union Disputes Procedure <p> Where a group of employees , who are members of a recognised trade union , have a complaint that can not be resolved through the individual grievance procedure , the trade union may , on their behalf , submit a collective grievance . Any such grievance must be supported by the National Official of either USDAW or NACO and will follow the procedure as set out in the agreements between those trade unions and The Co-operative Group .

We 're building a new way for people to tell us what they want in their will . <p> Content design is finding out why people come to a web page what they came to find out , order , apply for - - and giving them this information : <p> in a way they understand <p> through the most appropriate channel <p> at the time they need it <p> How and when we give users information is critical for our service . <h> Why we need to make wills easy to understand <p> A lot of people find wills intimidating because of the complex terminology used . When you make a will you 're asked to make decisions about your : <p> estate ' ( the things you own when you die ) <p> executors ' ( the people who manage your will when you 've died ) <p> beneficiaries ' ( the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're asking people to learn new concepts and unfamiliar terminology. - We then ask them to make important decisions based on what they understand of these concepts. - We need to make this easy , so people can be certain they 're making the right decision . <h> How we started trying to make it easy <p> We started by breaking up definitions of complex concepts using short , simple sentences and paragraphs written in a clear way . We presented this content over a few web pages before showing a screen asking the user to fill in the related question . <p> We know users tend to read very little on the web studies show only 16% of people read web pages word-for-word . We thought that by forcing users through these pages of information , it 's more likely that they 'd take the time to read them , and therefore more likely that they 'd be able to make an informed decision . <p> Initially it seemed to work . People commented on how straight-forward it seemed it felt easy , not complex . <h> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form , the less they were reading . They were scanning the pages , clicking through them quickly , and missing a lot of the information . <p> When they were asked a question , they skipped back and forth between screens to remind themselves of the concepts they needed to understand to answer . One person took pictures of the pages before moving on . <p> People were finding it time-consuming and frustrating . <p> And , we knew it was likely that this frustration would increase if users : <p> were in a busy environment <p> had short-term memory problems <p> had English as a second language <p> We realised we could n't truly rely on users reading , understanding and remembering the earlier information , even if we knew they would have passed through it . <p> We needed to rethink where and when we gave users information . <h> Make it easier , make it successful <p> By asking users to read information on one page and remember it later , we were increasing the mental and physical effort we were asking them to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having to go back to be reminded of information finding the back button , clicking it , waiting for pages to load also increases the interaction cost . <p> Research shows that usage goes down as the interaction cost goes up .

The team has a range of experience and skills from user research to interaction design . We 've been recruited from both within and outside Co-op to build transformational , user-focused digital services . <p> Content design might be new to you . So , here 's what it is , how it 'll change what we put on Co-ops website and why it 's essential for the future of the business . <h> What is content design ? <p> Content design is discovering why someone has come to our website or web page what they came to do , find out , order then exploring the quickest , easiest , simplest way to allow them to do that . <p> Content design gives essential content only at the point that it 's relevant and through the most effective channel . That means we must understand the whole service all the steps the user goes through to get their task done to determine the most effective place to give the user information . <p> So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Why we need to design content <p> The internet has given customers power . Expectations are raised . People expect online services to be easy and straight-forward . If we do n't serve customers well , we 'll disappoint them , frustrate them , lose their trust , and consequently their business.The future of Co-op relies on knowing our users and making services that will make their lives simpler . <p> It 's impossible to have good services without good content design . Getting information to people when they need it , how they need it and in a way that they understand , is critical . Content is the service . <p> So , we research our services with real users . We 're building services that we 're proud of , that are revolutionary , but more importantly , are built with the user at the centre . <h> Words get in the way <p> Users interact with web content in a different way to print . They 're impatient . They 're usually on a mobile device and time-poor . So they skim-read , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they need to be . 75% of each web page is n't read . We need to edit content to a bare minimum and get out of the way , so the user can get where they need , fast . <p> Web content should only exist if we know that there 's a need for it to be there . People generally do n't want to spend much time on a company 's website . They usually know why they 're there and what they want to do . We need to make this easy . If we ca n't explain what content is helping our users do , it should n't be on our site . <p> And all content should be meaningful , written using words we know our users use and understand . This might not be what we call things internally . Each word is competing for our users attention we need to make each one count . <h> Designing for all <p> We ca n't control who views our website . We ca n't assume any prior knowledge of the subject we write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance . <p> By writing in a consistently clear , simple , honest way we open up our services to all . The average reading age in the UK is 9 years old , and many users have English as a second language . We should write in a clear way , get rid of jargon and service-specific terminology , be friendly but to the point . We should n't be afraid to be obvious . If were not we 'll create a barrier between us and our users . And they 'll go elsewhere . <h> Designing with empathy <p> Each user comes to our site with their own story , situation , insecurities and struggles . What we think may be a simple field in a form could have emotional triggers for our users . What if someone is asked to enter their home address ' and they 're homeless or in a safe house ? Insensitivity can not just lose customers , but can upset and offend . <p> Regular user research with a diverse range of users will help us design empathetic services for everyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honest , transparent design that puts users at the heart of the business and in control of Co-op services and products .

Provenance is a start-up that uses blockchain technology to make supply chains more transparent . A blockchain is a public , tamper-proof record of transactions which is maintained and verified by a network of co-operating computers ( rather than by a central authority like a bank ) . <p> The Provenance alpha was a joint effort between Co-op Digital and Provenance to see if we could use their technology without having to add extra steps to our supply chain . <h> Starting with gladioli <p> Our small team ( myself , interaction designer Jack , and the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from source to shelf .

Gladioli are farmed locally in the UK and move from source to shelf in 2 to 5 days . Their supply chain has enough steps to be interesting , but is small enough for a proof of concept . <h> Working with what 's already there <p> We wanted to move quickly , which meant steering clear of changing- existing processes in the supply chain . Adding any new technology for tracking and verification purposes would be expensive to scale , so we avoided doing that . To keep us on track , we decided on some principles for our work. - <p> Tracking should be as close to real time as possible . <p> No manipulation of existing supply chain processes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to existing systems such as our suppliers ' sales and invoice software and our warehouse management system at our depot .

This data included evidence of environmental and welfare standards . We then linked these together using Provenance 's software to verify the batch of gladioli at each step in the chain . <p> We started off by meeting with the gladioli farmer , Matthew Naylor to find the number of flowers cropped in the field each day . This information is usually recorded on paper , however Matthew used his smartphone to log the daily cropping figures with the Provenance system . <p> Next , we met with our flower supplier , JZ Flowers .

It may be possible to come to an informal arrangement , especially for small or short-term changes to working patterns . <p> If the reason the colleague is wanting to work flexibly is to help them with a disability or a health condition , then this may be able to be done as a reasonable adjustment , rather than through the flexible working process .

Your manager will confirm if this policy applies in your situation . <h> Crucial bits <p> The amount of travel allowance you 'll get is the difference between what it currently costs you to travel to work and how much it will cost you to travel to your new location " although this will be subject to the green cap ' ( see below ) . <p> You 'll get the allowance based on the actual number of days you 'll be working at your new location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working pattern , your holiday entitlement , bank holidays ( if these are n't included in your holiday entitlement ) and the number of days you 'll be working at the new location . <p> You 'll receive the allowance each period for three years following the change in location .

So we want our colleagues to use public transport to travel to work wherever they can . <p> If using public transport is an option for you , the amount of the travel allowance you 'll get will be capped at the cost of using public transport minus what it currently costs you get to work . You can still choose to drive to work - but if this cost is higher , you 'll get the travel allowance up to the cost of using public transport . If it 's not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport , then we wo n't apply the cap . <p> Remember we provide interest-free season ticket loans to help with the cost of using public transport .

The amount you get will be grossed up to make sure that you get the actual sum your manager has agreed with you . <h> How to calculate the allowance <p> Current cost <p> First , you need to work out what it currently costs you to travel to work .

You then need to apply the green cap - so if the cost of using public transport to your new place of work is less than the cost of driving , you should use this figure in the calculation . <p> At Co-op we take the safety of colleagues very seriously and do n't encourage long car journeys every day . So we 'll usually only reimburse journeys of up to 100 miles per day round trip . <h> Change in circumstances <p> The amount of the allowance is based on your current circumstances and we may review it if you : <p> move home <p> move workplace <p> change roles <p> change your working pattern <p> If you move home nearer to your new work location , then you should let your manager know . <p> If you 're off work sick during the period you 're getting the travel allowance , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your absence .

The approach our business takes to sickness absence is designed to achieve this . We expect our colleagues to aim for full attendance at work . Absence is costly and affects our ability to provide excellent customer service . This policy details the approaches to reduce absence levels and to support colleagues who return to work following absence . <p> We are committed to helping colleagues manage their health , fitness and well-being , which in turn will help them to perform to the best of their ability .

To help us reach that point , we 've done some work to define what it means to us and we 've just begun to look at how we 're going to develop our ideas in 3 areas . <p> We spoke to lots of groups within the Co-op including our Digital Advisory Board before deciding that we believe being trusted with data is made up of 3 things . These are : <p> Integrity . <p> Transparency . <p> Meaningful consent . <p> here 's how were developing these 3 areas . <h> Being transparent with how we 're using data <p> We want to build the right set of tools and technology to manage and link our data across the Co-op .

We believe that by co-operating with our colleagues we can share good practice and improve our governance . <h> Consent to use and share data <p> The third area we 're looking at is consent for us to use and share data . This is a topic that organisations do n't like talking about if they do n't have a position of transparency . We 're going to start the conversation with our members about data consent because we think that speaking to them will help us do the right things with data and will help us gain their trust . <p> Initially we 'll use our Member Voice surveys to start asking questions about data consent , and well- be speaking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called- Shaping our Co-op : Data Trust and Transparency Event- to get feedback from our members on trust and consent .

@@96829492 @1029492/ <h> Maternity - a colleague 's guide <p> We know that having a baby is an important and exciting time and we want to support you if you 're pregnant or a new mother . There are some important things that you need to know and do to help us make all the arrangements for your maternity leave and pay . <h> 1 ) Notification of pregnancy <p> As soon as possible , you should advise your manager that you are pregnant . You will also need to notify HR Services . This can be done by either you or your manager , and ideally should be done before the 15th week of pregnancy . <p> To ensure you receive any payment to which you may be entitled during your maternity leave , you need to download and complete the Application for Maternity Leave ( ML1 ) form ( PDF , 1 page 100KB ) with your Manager . It will ask you to indicate the date on which you wish to begin your maternity leave . <p> Please note that you can not commence your maternity leave before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due . <p> Your GP or midwife will provide a MATB1 form ( Maternity Certificate ) , which will confirm the date of the expected week of childbirth ( EWC ) . You will normally receive your MATB1 around the 21st week of your pregnancy . <p> This form should be attached to the Application for Maternity Leave ( ML1 ) form and be returned to HR Services , before the beginning of the 14th week prior to your due date . <h> Risk assessment <p> It is in your best interests and those of your baby , tell your manager as soon as possible that you are pregnant . Once you have told your manager they will carry out a risk assessment of your job to make sure it is still safe for you to continue . If necessary possible changes will be discussed with you . Once your manager has completed a risk assessment they will forward this to HR Services . If the circumstances regarding your health change following your risk assessment you must tell your manager at once so that the risk assessment can be reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby , irrespective of length of service or number of hours worked , are entitled to time off with pay for antenatal appointments . If you can , you should try to arrange your appointments to minimise disruption to your workplace , such as at the beginning or end of a day , or on days you do not work . However , if you tell your manager in advance that you have an antenatal appointment they will make all the necessary arrangements to ensure that you do not lose pay . <p> An antenatal appointment includes any appointment with your GP , midwife , hospital or health clinic , relating to your pregnancy . It may also include parentcraft and relaxation classes , but only where these appointments are made on the advice of your doctor , consultant , midwife or registered health visitor . <p> You should show your manager an appointment card or letter in advance of any appointment . <h> 2 ) MATB1 and ML1 forms <p> When you get your MATB1 form from your doctor or midwife , sometime after the 21st week of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can . <p> You then need to agree with your manager when the maternity leave is going to start . See the Maternity Policy for more details . <p> Complete the Application for Maternity Leave ( ML1 ) form ( PDF , 1 page 100KB ) and ask your manager to sign it . The manager then sends both the colleague 's MATB1 form and the completed ML1 form to HR Services . <p> We recognise that in certain circumstances it might not be possible to provide this information before the 14th week prior to your due date . <p> Without your MATB1 , we can not pay you maternity pay . If you are having difficulties in obtaining the certificate , raise this with HR Services as soon as possible . <p> If you change your mind about the date you wish to start your maternity leave , after you have completed your Application for Maternity Leave ( ML1 ) form , you must inform your manager as soon as possible and at least 28 days before you intend to begin your leave , unless this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HR Services in writing . <h> 3 ) Confirmation of Maternity Leave ( ML3 form ) <p> Once the Signed MatB1 and ML1 forms are received , HR Services will send confirmation of the return date and any maternity pay entitlements , and also a form for any colleague who wants to repay their pension contributions . <p> If you want to return to work earlier than the agreed return date set out in the ML3 confirmation , you need to tell your manager in writing at least eight weeks before the date they 're due to return . <h> 4 ) Taking leave <p> Before going on maternity leave , the colleague should discuss and agree with their manager the best time for them to take the holidays which they 'll accrue while on maternity leave . <h> 5 ) Keeping in touch days <p> Make sure you agree with your manager how you would like to keep in touch while on leave . <p> Colleagues can take up to 10 paid keeping in touch days during their Maternity Leave , but these need to be agreed in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Maternity Policy . <h> Unexpected events <p> If something unexpected happens during pregnancy and things have n't gone to plan , you or your manager is able to contact HR Services for advice on what support can be given . <h> 6 ) Returning to work <p> HR Services will make the assumption that you will be taking the maximum 52 weeks of ordinary and additional maternity leave , unless you inform us otherwise . If you wish to change your end of maternity date you must write to your manager giving at least 8 weeks notice of your intended date of return . <p> If you return to work after ordinary maternity leave , you are entitled to return to the same job in which you were employed prior to the beginning of your maternity leave . If you take additional maternity leave , in normal circumstances , you will return to your previous job or to a post with the same or similar duties to those you were carrying out before your maternity leave , unless this is not reasonably practicable . <p> In any case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks after the birth of your child . <p> Your manager may call or write to you a couple of weeks before you are due to return , to explain to you what time you should report for work on your return date . You may , if you wish , agree with your manager to use one of the keeping In touch days to attend work and discuss these return arrangements . <p> If you are sick on the day when you are due to return to work you should advise your manager accordingly and the usual sickness absence rules will apply . <p> If you decide that you do not want to return to work , you must write to your manager advising them accordingly , with the appropriate notice . You may be invited to an exit interview to discuss the reasons surrounding your resignation , which will then be processed in the usual way . <p> If you have any concerns about your pay on returning to work from maternity leave please contact HR Services and we will talk you through the process .

@@96829507 @1029507/ <p> At Co-op Digital we 're building products and services that 'll improve efficiency in the wider Co-op Group . Part of this is figuring out how we can give more time back to our Food colleagues in stores so they can spend time helping customers instead of shuffling handfuls of paperwork in their office . Basically , we want to make things things more predictable ie , knowing when a delivery will arrive so that colleagues can plan and use their time better . <h> Teaming up with ustwo <p> We brought in ustwo , a digital product studio , to help . At that point we needed more people power and ustwo have excellent experience in putting user needs at the forefront of everything they do . Their ethical values also made them a brilliant match for us . <h> Researching and learning during discovery <p> Our goal for discovery was to produce a set of alphas that would potentially benefit the food business . We spent time with and interviewed customers as well as our Food colleagues including store managers , colleague team members and depot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible speed through qualitative and quantitative research and design techniques such as sketching . Our interviews were sometimes focused and at other times wide ranging ; sometimes they were in depth and at others they were vox pops . Spending time listening to colleagues on the phones in our call centres and seeing what happens on our internal help desk helped us learn a lot too . <p> We took what wed learnt from our research and proposed alphas that might help with common problems we 'd encountered throughout the discovery . In the end we worked on 3 alphas with ustwo . Last year , we blogged about the product range finder which was one of them . <p> Now we 're talking about another one : the delivery alerts alpha . <h> Initial scope of delivery alerts <p> We posed these questions : <p> Can we speed up delivery turnaround times ? Can we reduce queuing during busy times ? <h> Starting simply and cheaply <p> We wondered if notifying a store of the arrival time of a truck would help make stores more efficient . So we set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of our cheap mobile phones to send a text message when he was approaching . Straight away we found that this was useful to stores so we felt confident that if we pursued this idea to the next stage , it 'd be useful . So we built a more robust prototype that would test our theory further . <p> At this point we realised we were crossing paths with another team in Co-op working on putting black boxes into our delivery trucks that could provide us with the data we needed . - So whilst that work was coming together with the third party supplying the black box , we pivoted slightly to focus more on this question : <p> Can we make important shop bulletins available to everyone , quickly ? <h> Building a digital dashboard <p> With the ease of a good agile team , the delivery alerts alpha became the store dashboard alpha because delivery alerts could be a part of something bigger . We built and trialled a store dashboard , a website running on an iPad . <p> It shows our Food colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news or information from the Support Centre that colleagues should read <p> By now , we had around 15 stores in Manchester and London to use the digital dashboard as an information source . We chose a mixture of big and small , city and rural . <h> Helping colleagues plan better <p> Once we had access to the data from the black boxes in the trucks , we built our delivery alerts module that sat in the bigger , more comprehensive dashboard . Then we broadened our trial to show colleagues when deliveries were going to arrive . With the dashboard they can see if their delivery truck was stuck in traffic . This meant they could plan ahead and use their time efficiently . <p> We got enough insight from the delivery alerts module and our tasks and news modules to calculate that it could give store managers up to 10% more time to spend on the shop floor . <h> Big thumbs up from colleagues <p> Naz at Faircross Parade Co-op said that knowing when deliveries will arrive is the main thing that would make the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the floor schedule . Co-ordinating better means that Naz can free up colleague time for other activity , like reducing queues at the tills . <p> Gemma from Taylor Road Co-op said that she could turn her deliveries around 10 minutes quicker using our dashboard .

To achieve this we need to create a business that continuously improves performance and productivity , and in which our people are inspired and motivated to be their best , making The Co-operative Group a great place to work , grow and develop . <p> The grievance approach is designed to help achieve this . Grievances are concerns , problems or complaints that colleagues raise that affect them at work . Resolving a grievance can provide an opportunity to resolve a workplace problem and improve working conditions . High performance and productivity depends on effective working relationships . The fair and reasonable handling of grievances is an important element in creating and maintaining those relationships . <h> What is this policy for ? <p> The policy will enable : <p> Grievances to be viewed constructively as an opportunity to resolve problems or workplace conditions <p> Informal resolution wherever possible <p> A consistent and transparent approach to be taken to handling issues across the organisation <p> Colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible A process that is simple , easy to use and understand , and reduces bureaucracy <h> Who is the policy for ? <p> All employees of The Co-operative Banking Group and its subsidiary companies , in the contribution levels of manage and enable delivery ( E ) , lead team or advise ( F ) and customer delivery ( G ) , excluding agency workers and contractors . <p> Colleagues in Level D and above have a separate grievance policy set out in their contract of employment . <h> Related policies <p> Some issues of a special nature may additionally require reference to different policies . Examples are cases of harassment and bullying , or whistleblowing , where colleagues should also consult the relevant policy statement too : <p> Bullying and harassment ( mutual respect ) <p> Whistleblowing ( concern at work ) <h> What is this policy not for ? <p> Appeals against certain decisions - e.g. Performance Ratings , Comparable Role and Role Level appeals should not be made using the grievance policy , the panel appeals policy should be used instead . <p> Formal meetings will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in writing . <p> The colleague should take all reasonable steps to attend any meetings or investigation meetings . <p> Colleagues will be given the opportunity to be accompanied by a trade union representative , an official employed by a trade union or a colleague employed by The Co-operative Banking Group . <p> Where the colleague does not attend the meeting for an unforeseeable reason then the meeting will be rearranged . Any further non-attendance may result in a decision being taken in their absence . <p> Should a colleague have difficulty at any stage of the grievance policy they should ask their manager or HR Representative for assistance ( e.g. to arrange for reasonable adjustments etc . ) . <p> In the event that after investigation the raising of the grievance is deemed to be malicious or with the intent to avoid or delay another process or procedure , the colleague may be managed in line with the misconduct policy . <p> Where a colleague or manager has an issue raised against them , support can be provided to them , e.g. from HRPS , or a trade union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Informal resolution <p> All colleagues are encouraged to discuss issues with their managers . Where a colleague wishes to raise an issue relating to their work , working conditions , pay and benefits , working hours , treatment from colleagues or any other issue affecting them at work , colleagues should talk to their manager informally in the first instance . The manager will look into the concern , and seek to resolve the matter quickly and fairly . In most cases this should resolve the issue effectively . <p> Where the issue can not be resolved informally , colleagues who want to enter a more formal process to seek resolution should enter the formal process set out below : <h> Formal process <p> Colleagues should : <p> raise the issue in a timely fashion , and wherever possible , within 28 calendar days of the issue arising <p> set out the issue in writing and send it to their manager <p> provide full details , and <p> state the outcome they would like to see to resolve their grievance <p> If a colleague feels unable to write to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue , the letter can be written to your HR Representative or to a different manager in the department/function <p> Written grievances will be acknowledged in writing and we will aim to contact the colleague within 7 calendar days following receipt of the written grievance to arrange a meeting <p> The meeting will be attended by the chairing manager and the individual raising the issue . Colleagues may have a trade union representative , an official employed by a trade union or a companion ( a colleague employed by The Co-operative Banking Group ) present at the formal meeting <p> The purpose of the meeting is to give colleagues the opportunity to explain their grievance and allow the person conducting the meeting to understand it and , if necessary , further investigate the issue .

This may include providing the names of any witnesses , disclosing relevant documents and attending interviews <p> We will aim to reach a decision within 14 calendar days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a decision will be provided as quickly as possible , whilst allowing for a full and thorough investigation of the issue . The decision will be provided to the colleague in writing . <p> Where the issue is about the immediate manager , an independent manager ( or HR ) will be asked to chair the meeting . <h> Appeal <p> Colleagues may appeal in writing within 7 calendar days of receiving the outcome letter . The reasons for appeal will usually fall within one of the following areas : <p> the process was not followed correctly <p> important information was not taken into consideration <p> the information provided did not support the conclusion reached <p> Colleagues should give adequate details of the reasons for appeal , as these will form the basis of the appeal meeting <p> An appeal meeting will be chaired by an independent manager , who will have had no prior involvement in the process <p> The appeal chair should be the manager 's manager or equivalent ( as long as they have had no prior involvement ) .

The outcome is final and there is no further right of appeal . <h> Collective concerns <p> Where a number of colleagues have the same or connected issue , the business may choose , with the agreement of those involved , to hold the meeting collectively . Where it is reasonable to do so , all complainants can attend the meeting electing one spokesperson . <p> Where colleagues are union members , if instructed , the relevant trade union may approach the employee relations team to raise the grievance collectively on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought from your HR Representative when handling collective issues , to ensure the appropriate action is taken.Process when employment has ended <p> Where the issue was raised prior to employment ending , the above process will apply . <p> Where employment has ended prior to an issue being formally raised , the ex-colleague should detail the grievance in writing . <p> The business may either respond to this in writing or if it believes it is appropriate to do , we may invite the ex-colleague to attend a meeting to discuss the matter . The decision will be final and there will be no right of appeal . <p> If it is no longer practicable to deal with the grievance the ex-colleague will be advised in writing.Process when linked to formal performance improvement or misconduct policies <p> Where a colleague raises an issue during another formal process , that process may be temporarily suspended at the discretion of The Co-operative Banking Group in order to deal with the grievance . <p> Where the grievance and formal cases are related it may be appropriate for the same manager to address both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecutive meetings . Should this be the case , both policies should be followed consecutively ( grievance first ) and an outcome for each provided separately <p> Where the grievance and the other formal issue are unrelated , they will be dealt with separately <p> Where the grievance is lodged after the other formal process has concluded , the grievance will be addressed separately ; however , if the grievance is really an appeal against a decision made in another formal process , it will be dealt with as an appeal under the relevant process , assuming that process has not been exhausted .

We thought about what we 'd like to be able to tell people about being an agile delivery manager at Co-op Digital , and how we could influence groups in the wider Co-op by sharing our better practices . <h> Just for starters <p> Since then , we 've tackled a lot of stuff on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new colleagues at Co-op Digital .

This will help us see where we need more training and what to focus on when we recruit <p> Our community 's work is starting to become recognised around the wider business . That 's important because it means more people will have an understanding of what delivery managers do and how we can help teams work more efficiently .

Then we each approached the timeline from a personal perspective and added pink post-its to mark our positives and blue post-its for personal negatives . Then we worked together to come up with actions to try and make sure the bad bits do n't happen again . After that , we each used marker pens to draw our highs and our lows . Here 's Steve in action ! <h> Making time for meetups <p> Interestingly , the timeline showed that each community member felt more positive when we 'd had regular meetings .

We presented this content over a few web pages before showing a screen asking the user to fill in the related question . <p> We know users tend to read very little on the web studies show only 16% of people read web pages word-for-word . We thought that by forcing users through these pages of information , it 's more likely that they 'd take the time to read them , and therefore more likely that they 'd be able to make an informed decision . <p> Initially it seemed to work . People commented on how straight-forward it seemed it felt easy , not complex . <h> But , people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less they were reading . They were scanning the pages , clicking through them quickly , and missing a lot of the information . <p> When they were asked a question , they skipped back and forth between screens to remind themselves of the concepts they needed to understand to answer . One person took pictures of the pages before moving on . <p> People were finding it time-consuming and frustrating . <p> And , we knew it was likely that this frustration would increase if users : <p> were in a busy environment <p> had short-term memory problems <p> had English as a second language <p> We realised we could n't truly rely on users reading , understanding and remembering the earlier information , even if we knew they would have passed through it . <p> We needed to rethink where and when we gave users information . <h> Make it easier , make it successful <p> By asking users to read information on one page and remember it later , we were increasing the mental and physical effort we were asking them to go through ( called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to be reminded of information finding the back button , clicking it , waiting for pages to load also increases the interaction cost . <p> Research shows that usage goes down as the interaction cost goes up . So , to give our service a better chance of success , we needed to lower the effort involved to use it . <h> Give information at the point it 's needed <p> So we moved the information to the same page as the question to the point the user needs to refer to it to make a decision . <p> In places , this made the pages long . <p> So , we : <p> kept the sentence and paragraphs clear and succinct <p> broke up lists into bullet points <p> interspersed the content with logical subheadings <p> This makes the text easier to scan users can jump to the section they need without having to travel to a separate section or memorise information . <p> We 've reduced the effort required to use our service and reduced frustration .

We 've asked them to join in ' and talk to us about their favourite pizza toppings , we 've arranged community dog walks and we 've done an awful lot of baby talk ! <p> By speaking and listening to our customers and members , we 've got a better chance of both meeting their needs and giving them what they 'd like . <p> One of our first Member Voice engagements was when we gave 100 active members in Holmfirth 6 bottles of wine so they could host their own wine tasting event . We asked for their thoughts and used their recommendations and tasting notes in point of sale material in- the Holmfirth store .

@@96829566 @1029566/ <p> This month , it 's 3 months since we set up our engineering community for software engineers , platform engineers , service managers and quality analysts at the Co-op . It 's early days but it 's already helping move Co-op engineering in the right direction . <p> Getting together with people who do similar jobs helps us all be more joined up which is really important , especially in a place as big as the Co-op . Without a community , we 'd be working in isolation because our day jobs are within Co-op Digital , Co-op Legal Services or Funeralcare . <p> When we began meeting regularly , we identified the areas we need to work together to develop , including how we support training and development and coming up with development standards . <h> We 've created infrastructure standards <p> I was really pleased to see that practices such as Continuous Delivery and Infrastructure as Code were already well established when I joined Co-op Digital 6 months ago . However teams were working in isolation at that point . Lots of them had similar problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that getting some of the services we were launching to a point where they were secure , reliable and supported was trickier than it needed to be because there was quite a bit of rework involved . <p> To make things simpler , we spent time during our community of practice meet-ups to create shared standards for our platform infrastructure . There 's still plenty to do and these things are never really finished of course , but we 're now in a much better shape and future projects will follow a much easier path . Most importantly , teams are more empowered to get on with stuff and do their job . <p> We 're also working on standards for how we 'll support cloud infrastructure across several teams . This work will sit with our Digital Operations team which is forming steadily . <h> Making better technology decisions <p> Out of that also came a clear need to provide better support around making technology decisions . We want teams to be empowered , but at the same time there 's always going to be a limit on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach has been to try and provide really great guidance so teams can make decisions in context rather than needing meetings to make decisions . It 's all still quite early days so again we 'll hopefully come back again soon and update on how it 's getting on . <h> We 've been hiring <p> We 've worked with some great external companies while we 've been adding gradually to our in-house expertise but we 're at a stage now where we 're looking to bring in a significant number of software and platform engineers . The Co-op Digital team and the wider engineering community of practice is looking forward to new talent joining us . From there , the culture of the team will grow and strengthen . <p> If you 're interested , take a look at our Work with us page for the roles we currently have open . We 'll be recruiting for engineers for the Funeralcare team shortly . 
@@96829568 @1029568/ <h> co-op electrical <p> User research helps make products and services that work for the people who use them . It takes loads of different forms including lab sessions and interviews , onsite visits and analysing data but , regardless of its form , it must be present throughout the design process . And even after the thing is live . - <h> Moving into a user research role <p> I 've worked at the Co-op for just under 2 years . I originally joined the Analytics and Optimisation team , but for the last 10 months I 've been a user researcher at Co-op Digital . <p> User research really appealed to me because it 's about listening to users as well as looking at data . My old role was heavy on the quantitative side of things : I evaluated data collected from user journeys and improved the experience for users . Good user researchers consider both quantitative and qualitative research so I 've been working on my qualitative research skills . Now I feel even better equipped to help teams design the right thing . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user research role after seeing the work that our now Head of User Research James Boardwell and the team were doing with wills . The multidisciplinary team was working in an agile way to build a digital service to make it simpler and quicker for Co-op customers to get a will . <p> I saw how both data and qualitative research fed into the design process . User research formed the basis for discussions and the team could test ideas , put them in front of people and iterate them quickly . The whole team came to user research sessions so that everyone saw first-hand how users behaved when we put prototypes in front of them and asked questions . The team analysed the themes that came out of the sessions together which meant that everyone had a similar idea about where the design was heading . <p> Everything moved so quickly and decisions were based on things that the team had seen or heard . At each show and tell the team knew so much more than the week before they 'd added another piece to the jigsaw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . I loved watching their progress . <h> My first taste of user research <p> Supporting James was my first experience as a user researcher . I joined the Wills team during a sprint focused on increasing the number of people making it to the confirmation page . I already had good experience in this from my previous role but here I also got to see James talking to people , showing them the prototype and doing qualitative research in lab sessions . <p> The data I 'd collected told us what was happening with real people using the website , and James ' conversations with people told us whyit was happening . The data showed that the exit rate from the Your details ' page was disproportionately high . Qualitative research told us that people felt uncomfortable giving their personal details before knowing exactly what the service offered . Changing the order of the pages , so , giving the user more upfront information , resulted in more people completing the form . <h> Learning how user research works in a product team <p> I spent 6 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the chance to test things to make sure we 're doing the right thing for users . This way , any decisions we make are better informed . <p> Working on Membership opened my eyes to other ways of doing research too . It 's not just about interviews . We : <p> used qualitative website feedback and quantitative analytics to compare what users told us with what they actually do <p> visited stores to find out what our members and customers talk to colleagues about <p> spoke directly to members <p> It 's about analysing all available resources . <h> Leading my first project <p> For the last 2 months I 've been leading the user research on a discovery in our Electrical business . This project has helped me learn a lot about how user research informs service design through techniques like customer journey mapping and service blueprints . Service design is a fairly new way of thinking at Co-op Digital so leading this project was sometimes challenging , but we 've got a strong user research community at Co-op Digital and support and advice was always available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth it <p> I think the biggest challenge for a user researcher is using all of their observations and data to find the need , and working with the team to translate these into things we can work on . <p> User research encourages teams to take a more balanced approach to design . It changes the way teams work and brings the business and digital sides of things together . It 's a way to stop people jumping to conclusions about what 's right ' because we 're using evidence to make decisions . And ultimately , that 's going to work better . <p> If learning about how people behave and why sounds interesting and you want to help teams build the right thing , quickly and cost-effectively , get in touch with James Boardwell or leave a comment on the blog . <h> Hello I 'm Joel Godfrey <p> I 've just joined the digital team at the Co-op as an Agile Business Analyst . <p> Joel Godfrey <p> I used to work in our Food business in IT as a Business Analyst , working recently on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week shadowing Liam- Cross who 's working on the Local Causes- service which is part of our new Membership .

If things are resolved , then managers should n't keep these notes any longer . <h> First performance improvement meeting <p> Managers should send the colleague a letter to invite them to a first Performance Improvement Meeting , giving them at least 48 hours ' notice ( template letter PIP1 ) . <p> If the colleague wants to be accompanied to the meeting by a trade union rep or another colleague , they should arrange this and let the manager know before the meeting .

This will depend on the type of role and the length of time the manager expects it will take to see an improvement in their performance . It 'll usually be a minimum of four weeks , although may be less than this if we believe we should be able to see an improvement sooner . <p> After the meeting , the colleague will be sent a Performance Improvement letter ( template letter PIP3 ) , including a copy of the agreed Performance Improvement Plan . <h> Rearranging performance improvement meetings <p> Colleagues should do their best to attend , but if they or their chosen representative ca n't make it , they should tell the manager holding the meeting as soon as possible letting them know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to rearrange it for a time that works for everyone . <p> If the colleague does n't turn up for the meeting , without telling us in advance , we 'll rearrange it and write to confirm the new details using template letter PIP2 . <p> If they do n't turn up for the rearranged meeting , we 'll deal with the matter under the Disciplinary Process " unless there are exceptional circumstances , in which case we 'll rearrange it once more . <p> Any rescheduled meetings will usually be within a week of the original meeting time . <h> Performance improvement review meetings <p> Colleagues will be invited to a Performance Improvement Review Meeting ( template letter PIP4 , template letter PIP5 to reschedule the meeting ) to review their performance against their Performance Improvement Plan , giving them at least 48 hours ' notice .

We launched on Friday , a big campaign so that we 've got 50 pioneers at the Co-op in time for the AGM , and we 're building to 1,500 pioneers . <p> That is a huge moment for us as we reinvent our concept of pioneers from what they were in 1844 to a 21st century version , where we have someone connecting people in every community in the UK , and improving people 's lives . <p> So , we got off to a great start and we 've already had , on the first day , 40 applications or expressions of interest in the role .

We can use these numbers to find out how much stronger and how much more vibrant the new Co-op membership is , and how engaged people are with it . <p> The data we collect belongs to all of us that 's the nature of a co-operative .

@@96829597 @1029597/ <h> New Starters <p> I 'm Mark and I recently joined Co-op Digital as a user researcher on Co-op Funeralcare . I 'm part of a multi-disciplinary team which means I work alongside developers , designers and product managers as well as internal and external subject matter experts from the funeralcare industry . <p> At Co-op Digital we 're building a service so that our Co-op Funeralcare colleagues can meet the needs of their customers more efficiently . The less time spent doing paperwork , the more time they have for- their customers . Their role includes welcoming friends and family who are visiting their loved one , arranging personalised keepsakes , and of course organising the funeral including the cremation or burial . <p> As a user researcher , I help my team learn about our Funeralcare colleague 's roles ; which systems are already in place and where digital can make things better . The best way for me to do this is by visiting funeral homes , listening to my colleagues who work there , and watching them at work . <p> When I 'm back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rest of my team . That said , I believe that user research is a team sport ' so I always encourage my colleagues to come and see for themselves too . <p> Contextual research ( actually going to the place to see how things work ) makes sure we build a service based on needs rather than on our assumptions of what our colleagues- need . So in this sense , my role is to make sure that when my team starts iterating on the service or building a new feature , we know it 's going to be useful as well as useable . Contextual research means that both time and money are spent wisely . We 'll iterate what we build along the way , of course . <p> I feel privileged to be on this team . Our Funeralcare colleagues only have one chance to arrange a loved one 's funeral . Building something that helps them do that smoothly and sensitively feels like a really important thing to work on and get right . <p> I 'm so pleased to welcomeIan to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for helping our Co-op better understand online social communities , having spent the best part of his early career helping others do the same . <p> Ian Ferguson <p> Communities are important to Co-op , because we 're co-owned by over 5 million members , who each live in local communities where we operate Food stores and Funeral homes . But , increasingly we 're all forming communities online too , ones that transcend geographical boundaries and instead form around common interests and ideas . <p> It 's Ian 's job ( andScott 's , Sophie 's andCatherine 's ) is to to find relevant online communities , understand them and introduce them to our Co-op , as well as to keep talking and listening to our existing members . The two-way dialogue we can have on social media means we can welcome more and more people , their thoughts and ideas into our Co-op . <h> Hello I 'm Joel Godfrey <p> I 've just joined the digital team at the Co-op as an Agile Business Analyst . <p> Joel Godfrey <p> I used to work in our Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our Membership and Transformation programmes .

This means providing you with support in the early weeks , so you know how you 're doing and any questions or concerns can be sorted out quickly . So everyone who joins the Co-op will have a probationary period . This includes colleagues on fixed-term and temporary contracts . <h> Crucial bits <h> Purpose of probationary period <p> We know it can be a little daunting starting in a new role with a new organisation . So at the Co-op , probationary periods are all about helping you to settle in and find your feet . <p> As a new colleague , a probationary period gives you the chance to get a good understanding of your role and what 's expected of you - and also to make sure you get the training and support you need to do your job well . <p> It also gives your manager a way to assess how you 're doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role . <h> Length of probationary period <p> The length of a probationary period varies between business areas , but is usually either 13 weeks or six months . For colleagues in Insurance the provisions of this policy will apply during the first 9 months of your employment . Your manager will confirm the length of your probationary period when you start or you can look at your Principle Statement of Terms and Conditions . If you need a copy of this , contact HR Services . <h> Feedback and support <p> Your manager will give you feedback regularly throughout your probationary period , so you know what 's going well and if there are any areas where you might need some more training and support . Talk to your manager about how things are going for you and tell them if there 's anything you 're not clear about or you need more support with . <h> Formal reviews <p> As well as getting ongoing feedback , you 'll have some formal review meetings with your manager during your probationary period . These are an opportunity for you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to make sure you 're both happy with the way things are going . There 's more information about reviews in the Probationary Period Review Process . If you 're not sure when your reviews will be taking place , ask your manager . <h> Absence <p> As it says in the Absence Policy , we operate a system of absence triggers . For colleagues within their probationary period , the trigger is two absences within this period . This means that if you have two periods of absence while in your probationary period , we 'll arrange a meeting with you to discuss your absence . <h> Conduct <p> If we have any concerns about your conduct during your probationary period we 'll address these within the Co-op Probationary Period Review Process .

You 'll start working towards these goals within your probationary period . But if a yearly or half-yearly review falls within your first three months , it may be too early for them to make a fair assessment of your performance so you might not get a performance rating . <p> You can find our Colleague Guide to Performance Management on the Intranet . <h> If you need further support <p> If you have any questions about probationary periods , please speak to your manager .

@@96829615 @1029615/ <p> Before Christmas we started working on our architecture principles ; a set of principles to empower and guide all colleagues who design , build or buy technology for the Co-op . We put together a team from across the Co-op Group to create the principles in line with Co-op values . <p> Since then , our architects who put them together have improved them , shortened them and have tested them with some of the people who 'll be using them . <h> It 's important to show and to share <p> We knew that the best way to get meaningful feedback would be to test the principles with real users . We asked our colleagues across different projects and business units to test them so we could get a better idea of how well they might work in the wider Co-op . Colleagues told us they wanted the principles to have more clarity , direction and include pointers on how to use them . So we 've made changes based on their feedback . <p> Here 's a shorter version of the latest version of our 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a latest version , and we anticipate this will change ( probably shorten ) in the future . <h> Understand what people need <p> We find out who all the real users are and how to meet their needs in order to define what a service should do and who else is it impacts . Technical and design decisions should come from what people need and not from organisational structures or silos . <h> Act based on context <p> Context includes our environment , the wider Co-op , the value chain , the changing market , and the problem were trying to solve . Technology quickly becomes uncompetitive as the industry moves on . We need to look beyond the industries we know well for examples of ways we could do things better . <h> It 's not just about the technology <p> Coming up with a technology solution ' before we 've understood the problem could- mean we- waste significant time and money on a project that goes wrong . We understand problems well when we test how a technology fits with users needs , processes , people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we work in silos we usually only see things from one perspective . That means we 're less likely to spot problems that will come up later on in a project so having conversations early on will lead to a better outcome . <h> Trusted , reliable and secure <p> We need to consider how well a technology needs to work ( as opposed to what it does ) so that it 's trusted , reliable , easy to support and secure . If we do n't do this , the technology wo n't meet user needs and will cost a lot of time and money to fix . We need to take time to ensure the technology is secure , reliable , supportable and that it handles data responsibly . <h> Prove it works <p> Just because something worked for someone else , does n't mean it will work here . If we have n't proven that something actually meets real user needs before committing , we might find ourselves making compromises later on . <h> Balance cost , value and risk <p> We should make decisions based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they impact each other . For example , choosing a solution because it 's the cheapest to deliver does n't mean it 's going to be the cheapest to run , manage or provide the same amount of value . <h> Scope and ownership will change <p> We ca n't assume everything will stay the same . Things will change but we do n't always know what when we 're designing something . Smaller things are easier to change so we need to look for opportunities to break down problems and choose the right technology for each component . - <h> Make things so that they work with other things <p> If our technology limits our access to data , is difficult to use with other things , or does n't work with other technologies , we 're going to have very little flexibility in the future . We can create value we did n't expect through appropriate sharing and reusing of services and information while respecting data protection , privacy and security requirements . <h> Do the hard work to keep it simple <p> Thinking ahead is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure we completely remove the old thing first . We need to leave things in a better condition than how we found them . <h> Next up : governance <p> We 're going to start work on a new governance model that will sit alongside and complement the principles . We 'll talk about our progress on that soon . <p> The Co-op architecture community <p> Were always looking for- talented people to come and work with us . At the moment were recruiting platform and software engineers to join our growing engineering community . You can find out more about working for Co-op Digital . <h> One thought on " Our Co-op Architecture Principles " <p> You make a brilliant point about remembering that ownership will change keeping options open even after a project is completed is an incredibly important principle . Sustainable materials ensure that your changes and additions will remain in perfect ( or better ) condition for future owners while making sure that your project is enhancing the state of the property .

@@96829652 @1029652/ <h> user researcher <p> Last weekLaura Hiard an interaction designer and user researcher Tom Walker visited Edge Hill University . Tom graduated from Edge Hill 2 years ago and was invited back to talk to some third year students who are currently studying web design and development . <p> Laura Hiard &amp; Tom Walker <p> Why did you do it ? <p> Laura : I graduated - 3 years ago and remember what it was like to be in my final year and how unprepared I was for the real world . Since then I 've worked for a number of companies in varying roles and I 've learned a lot . I felt like I 'd be able to connect and hopefully offer something of use to them . I also saw it as a good opportunity to practice my public speaking skills with a slightly more forgiving audience . <p> Tom : For me it was a similar thing . I was on the same course as these students just a few years ago and it felt good to have an opportunity to try and curb some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> Edge Hill University <p> What did you speak about ? <p> Laura : Our brief was to speak to the students about anything we felt would be useful , but to discuss how we incorporate the user into our processes and decisions . With that in mind , once we spoke about doing the talk together , it became clear that it would be good to highlight within a specific example how user research and design work together . <p> We began by showing the difference between user experience design and service design , and the importance of starting with user needs to make something that 's not just usable , but useful too . Then , we discussed how to use these , along with hypotheses , to make design decisions . <p> Tom : We also took the opportunity to give the students some advice for their working lives , based on our own experiences . I think that part went down particularly well . We spoke about how to make the best of a bad working situation and how to keep learning and striving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive feedback about that part . <p> What was the response like from the students ? <p> Tom : The response was great . We got some really astute questions about our work process while we were there and a few students even reached out to us on Twitter afterwards to ask advice . <p> Laura : A few of them even set up Twitter accounts after we said how useful it can be for networking . <p> What did you learn ? <p> Laura : I learned that there definitely seems to be value in going out and speaking to students . Talking about what a real working day is like in the careers that they 're striving for , and introducing them to new practices that they might not yet be familiar with . After some feedback about them wanting a little more detail about some of the topics we covered , we know what we 'd change for next time . We heard that some of the students were later looking at the Co-op jobs site , so we must have made a fairly good impression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have for them ? <p> Tom : A couple of things . These are the points we touched on during the talk. - <p> Immerse yourself and continue learning outside the classroom . Which is a lot easier than you might think . You can read and reading does n't have to be boring . You can do that on Twitter or read some Medium blogs or a few articles . Try to attend meet ups and get to know the community . And talk to each other . If you have read something , tell someone about it . Ask them about the things they have read or the meet ups they 've attended . Then continue into your career . <p> Identify your own personal weaknesses . Studying for a degree is difficult and does take time but do n't give up . If you 're not good at something , try to understand why you might not be good at it and fix it . I struggled with code when I was a student . So I filmed myself talking through my code and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understand that it was some basics stuff that I did n't quite get . Once I knew that , I knew what I needed to do to change it . <p> I 've now been at the Co-op for a couple of months . In that time I 've met lots of people , seen lots of work going on and talked about what I do with many , many people . I 've even written my first CoopDigital blog post- about user research at the Co-op . <p> One thing that I know we still need to work on is sharing wider what user research really is and how it should be used to influence what we do and how we do it . This is fine , it 's part of our jobs as experienced agile people and experienced researchers . It 's one of the reasons we 're hiring so many good people . <p> In my previous place of work , if someone called what we do user testing ' there would almost always be someone who 'd jump up and say User Research NOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , I knew what they meant , the person uttering it knew what they meant and it always felt like a bit of an over-reaction to me , personally , I 'd just smile and let it go . <p> Moving to somewhere where it is a less familiar concept I 'm beginning to realise why people did it . <p> I 'm finding that , for some people , user testing ' is something you do near the end , you 're fairly convinced you 've got it right , you 're fairly convinced it 's going to work and it 's going to go down well . What you might get is some feedback or minor tweaks to make it even better . I think the issue is the word testing ' , where testing is generally done just before you go live to spot bugs and defects . <p> That 's not what user research and agile development is , what its for and what it 's brilliant at . <p> User research is invaluable to us to help decide if we should build/release something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should work . It shows us how the thing we make will fit into users lives . It gives us insight into the language people use and how they view the world . It also helps us understand the problems in their lives they 're trying to solve , the tasks they 're trying to achieve and how what we build can help solve that problem or complete that task . <p> There is also the issue of what were testing when we do research : we 're testing our designs , we are n't testing our users . The user does n't pass or fail , the design does . <p> Hello , my name 's Simon and I 've just joined the team at CoopDigital as a user researcher. - I 'm really excited to be here and help the team build some world class digital services . <p> Simon Hurst user researcher <h> What does a user researcher do ? <p> User researchers fulfil several roles for a team , we 're there to help them understand : <p> 1 ) Who the users of our services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To build great services you need to truly empathise with your users . <p> 2 ) What 's the problem the user is trying to solve , what goal are they trying to achieve ? How can we support them to achieve their goal ? <p> 3 ) Whether the solution we 're looking to provide works well and how can it be better ? <h> Meeting real people <p> We do this by getting out of the building and meeting real people , talking to them and trying to understand their lives , watching them trying to complete their goals or use things we 're building . <p> We work with a huge variety of people , this includes those who are just learning the ropes , people who have maybe been bought a tablet by their children , or people who use a screenreader to interact with their device because of a visual impairment . <h> Bringing the team along <p> It 's even better when you bring members of the team with you , getting people who are building the service and writing the code to see users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them struggling can have a tremendous impact on how they tackle problems . The result is a team who care about what they 're building and are absolutely committed to making it the best it can be . <p> User researchers are interested in if people can use things to complete a task , user research is n't about asking people if they like ' what we 've built , or what they think of the colours . <p> It can be frustrating for people to see something they 've designed and built not working , to see people struggling to understand the words they 've used , or to interact with the clever little interface they 've made . However , the sooner we can recognise the issues , the sooner we can fix them , it 's better to find this out before you release the thing . <p> It 's even more important to understand why we are building something in the first place , is it needed by people ? Is it helping them to achieve a goal or to solve a problem ? If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most beautiful designed and usable product or service , but if it 's not needed then no one will ever use it . <p> We 'll be looking at- how we get involved with users more and more in the near future and we 'll be sure to blog about how we 're doing it and what we 're learning along the way . We 'll also be- working hard to try and understand how user research applies in an organisation as diverse and varied as Co-op . There 'll be- plenty more blogs to come from us on that . <p> We 're recruiting user researchers to join our growing CoopDigital team in Manchester . These new , permanent roles are critical to our ability to deliver brand new digital services for The Co-op , its customers and members . <p> Our user researchers play a pivotal role in our multidisciplinary agile teams , working with product managers , designers , developers and more to develop and share our understanding of user needs ; managing , facilitating and analysing continuous research throughout the phases of service delivery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . <p> It 's a chance to join a team at the beginning of its journey , helping to shape CoopDigital as a team and research as a community of practice just as much as the services you 'll lead our research work on .

@@96829686 @1029686/ <p> We 'll be talking a lot about Co-op Membership , in the company of many of our members , at our Annual General Meeting tomorrow . We 've also just had a retrospective where leaders from across our business got together to look at Membership . We reminded ourselves of what we originally set out to achieve , evaluated our progress and discussed what 's gone well and areas we feel we can improve on . <p> Members have earned over -45 million from the 5% they get back by buying our own-brand products and services . They also earn 1% for local causes and since September they 've accumulated -9 million . Last month we gave that -9 million to over 4,000 local causes across the UK . <p> And it 's not just about new Membership . We 've also reconnected with our loyal existing members . Since September , almost 1 million of our existing members have started to use their cards again . This means we now have 4.5 million active members trading across all our businesses . <h> But there 's still room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the past 8 months but there 's still much more to do . We 've been listening to feedback from colleagues , members and customers along the way so we can continue to improve things . We do regular user research and retrospective reviews to make sure were continually building a membership scheme that works for our members . This is reflected in our service map that Jack blogged about recently . <h> Just 7% of members chose a local cause during the first 6-month cycle <p> Members love the idea of choosing a local cause to support with the 1% they earn on own-brand purchases , but they 've also told us that choosing a cause needs to be easier . <p> The team has been working hard to make it simpler on the website . We 've iterated our design in line with learnings from research and the rate of members choosing a cause has increased by over 10% . We 're now looking to make choosing a cause simpler and more accessible in store . <h> There 's some confusion around reward structure <p> We found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with points ' . They ask : but what are they worth ? ' To make things simpler , Co-op rewards are shown in pounds and pence . But , because Co-op members are rewarded in 3 ways ( dividend points , the 1% community reward and the 5% member reward ) there 's still some confusion with members around how much they 've actually earned and how to spend it . <p> We 've been doing trials in store to make it easier to understand what the 5% means in terms of value by highlighting receipts , printing coupons with value and changing labeling on the shelves . We 'll be looking at making our communications simpler through things like member pricing and member baskets . <h> Not enough temporary member cards are fully registered <p> At the moment , customers can pick up a temporary card in store and start collecting rewards immediately . Then they need to register their temporary card online to become members and to be able to use their rewards . Not as many people are doing that as we 'd like so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the whole thing in store . <p> We 've been testing different options and will be running more pilots in June including use of in-store tablets and SMS messaging . We have also been considering how we take the -1 share payment . This is a really important step to be recognised as a member and we need to make it easier . <h> Helping more members have their say <p> When you 're a member you have the chance to influence what we do and how we do it by joining in . The membership website offers opportunities to Get involved ' . Recently , members sampled our new beers and wrote the tasting notes a great example of the Co-op difference ! Although we 've seen some fantastic involvement from members , we think we can do more to help them find out about the opportunity in the first place . <p> We know that most involvement has been from new members , aged under 30 , who have seen the Get involved ' section of the site when they 've completed registration . We 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places to make them much more easy to find for all members . <h> Where we 're going from here <p> We 've been listening to colleague , member and customer feedback as we 've been going along so we can make improvements .

@@96829736 @1029736/ <h> Ben Terrett <p> Im Gail . I 've been a graphic designer for over 20 years and up to now I 've worked- predominantly in pedestrian signage systems , exhibition and information design- projects . <p> These projects have mostly involved the ordering and arrangement- of words ( typography ) and mapping systems on physical products to help- orientate and direct people around cities and spaces . <p> Gail Mellows <p> But at the Co-op in the digital team I 'm developing- typographic guidance for designers and helping them create clear typographic- hierarchies without using lots of different sizes and weights ( which creates visual- noise and makes things harder to read and understand ) . <p> In past projects this is what I 've done in the context of displaying- information on physical products in physical environments . Now I 'm applying it to- information on-screen . <h> Why am I now working in digital ? <p> Just over 2 years ago I moved from London to Manchester with my partner and- daughter . After looking at the design industry in Manchester , I wondered where I- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising-led industry in- which I had few established professional relationships . <h> I decided to explore other- ways of applying what I 'd spent years doing <p> I came across the Ladies that- UX group . The first meet-up I went to happened to be at the Co-op in Angel Square . A number of women from the digital team at the Co-op were- speaking about their roles and how they had come to be there . <p> The panel were really encouraging about trying new things career-wise and taking a chance . Ben- Terrett was also there and described the principles behind the development of- Co-op digital products and services . <p> There were lots of parallels with my- approach and ethos . At the end of the event , feeling pretty nervous , I approached- Andrew Travers- to talk to him about what I'd- been doing . <h> I 've now been at Co-op Digital for 2 months <p> I started by- looking at how typography is being used across various products and services- and using this information to develop specific typographic guidance for the use of- Co-op @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , colour , juxtaposition , - vertical and horizontal spacing of type has a very practical job to do as well as- fundamentally conveying the character of Co-op . <p> For the team that work on our brand Ive been developing- ways of sharing information and best practice for using type , imagery and colour- across digital and non-digital applications . <h> It 's a steep learning curve for me <p> I spend a lot of my time moving bits of type up- and down so that they look good as well as make sense as content ( familiar- ground ) and wrestling with things like the fold ' , screen real estate ' and CSS- modules ( unfamiliar ground ) . <p> I like the fact that the Digital team at the Co-op is actively encouraging women to work with them- and offers flexibility around work and family commitments . <p> There 's been an open- and positive reaction to me bringing my non-digital experience into the digital- team . It 's seen as being an advantage . <p> Last week we began a series of Service Design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two week discovery phase by the end of which we 'll pick three projects to take in Alpha . <p> The project is being led by myself and Jo Whitfield the Finance Director in Food . We 're working with UsTwo as our service design partner . Importantly , as the unit of delivery is the team , our team is made up of CoopDigital , Food and UsTwo . <p> The team have visited stores , spoken to our colleagues , spent some time in a depot and with our call centre . We 've been out talking to customers and members . <p> Food Service Design discovery <p> There 's lots to cover so we 've been sketching user journeys with colleagues from every part of the business . We 're looking for clear user needs that will make things easier for members , customers or colleagues . <p> Outputs from a sketching workshop <p> As we believe in working in the open , we 'll blog about our progress on this blog . <p> At our AGM on Saturday , Richard shared with members the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As a member , everytime you buy Co-op branded products and services and use your card , you 'll get 5% back on what you 've spent from a loaf of bread to a funeral plan . You can then use that 5% anytime that you want to against your next purchase or save it up for as long as you like . <p> As well as the 5% for you , 1% of the value of the Co-op branded products will also go to local causes that you help to choose . <p> As Ben said yesterday- the simplicity of our new logo design is really going to make Co-op products and services stand out , so as a member you can see the items where you 'll get something for you and something for your community . <p> It 's important that our colleagues and Members ' Council can easily explain membership ( we know we 've made it hard for them in the past ) and we also want them to be able to feedback on the experience . This is why over the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Autumn by the rest of our members . <p> But we are n't going to stop there . We 'll keep looking at ways to make being a Co-op member even better . And , like Mike said on Saturday we 're committed to radical transparency so we 'll be sharing our progress here on the blog . As a start , in the next few weeks we 'll share the work we 've done so far looking at how we can create new ways to give members a voice in their Co-op.

We 've spoken less about the Digital Operations team and the work it does before those products and services can be made available to the world . <p> Time for an intro ? <p> We recently did a show and tell over in Federation but for those who could n't make it , here 's what we spoke about . <h> The Digital Operations team 's responsibilities <p> The Digital Operations team looks after 3 things : <p> Service management . <p> Platform infrastructure . <p> IT security . <p> The role we play differs for each area of work . For example , for Membership our role is to run the live service and its infrastructure , whereas for location finder we 're supporting the team while they run things themselves . Sometimes , our role is more about helping teams who are designing new services to think about how they 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the early idea through to being live . <h> How we support teams <p> The Digital Operations team does n't take on development , support or responsibility for running new services . These things fall under a product or service team 's remit and we advise them . When teams need platform or operations engineers to build and run something , we help them find the people and resources they need . <h> We help Digital and Group work together <p> Co-op Digital is only one part of the Co-op , so it 's important that the work we do is in line with the wider policies . We help digital and non-digital people work together by translating Group policies into something accessible for digital teams to work from , and by helping Group colleagues understand how agile ways of working can support the policies . <h> Saving teams times by creating patterns <p> A really important part of our role is to build a set of patterns and ways of working that will help teams build things that are secure , reliable and scalable and perform well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that using the patterns will help teams make sure their product or service has security controls , disaster recovery , monitoring , alerting , a way for users to tell us about issues , and a support route to get those bugs to the developers . <p> The patterns are being built around Co-op policies such as our security and data protection policy , which means that if a team uses one to build they will have ticked most of the security policy checkboxes . <h> Ready for public consumption ? <p> We 're also the keepers of the readiness checklists ' a list of things that need to be in place before teams make something new publicly available . Points on the checklist includes whether an alpha is publicly accessible ; whether it captures colleague , member or customer data and if it integrates with any internal Co-op systems . The checklists are n't a hoop to jump through just before a service goes live teams need to start thinking about being production-ready right from alpha phase . <h> Working on something new ? Tell us all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show and tell was : if you 're working on something new , involve us as early as possible . This way we can share any patterns and technology that might help you work more efficiently . There 's no reason to reinvent the wheel each time we build something new .

I want to talk to you a bit about Membership and community , because this is a landmark week for us . There are 2- big things that are happening that I 'm going to tell you about . <p> The first is we 've started recruiting for Member Pioneers . We launched on Friday , a big campaign so that we 've got 50 pioneers at the Co-op in time for the AGM , and we 're building to 1,500 pioneers . <p> That is a huge moment for us as we reinvent our concept of pioneers from what they were in 1844 to a 21st century version , where we have someone connecting people in every community in the UK , and improving people 's lives . <p> So , we got off to a great start and we 've already had , on the first day , 40 applications or expressions of interest in the role . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 10th and we want a really high calibre of committed people that have got an appetite to make their communities better . So if you know anybody , or would like to do it yourself , please do n't hesitate to go online and fill out the form . It 's a really easy process . <p> The second initiative I want to talk to you about is the pay out that we 're giving to local causes . On April 19th we 're going to be paying out -9 million to 4,000 local causes . It 's a huge milestone event for the Co-op and signifies a moment where the world can see that we 're moving from being about financial transactions , which are important , to really participating and supporting those causes in our local communities . <p> We 're doing a social media campaign , there 's going to be celebrations in every store throughout the UK , and we 've highlighted 46 beacon stores which are really special and will be great examples of what the best really looks like . If you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what 's going on and develop a relationship with the local cause , that 's what we 'd like to see so please look out for it on April 19th and do what you can to take part . <p> This Saturday , 8 April , is the deadline for Co-op members to choose which local cause their 1% will go to . If you have n't chosen already , sign in online and you 'll be prompted to choose one . You 'll see this : - <p> From this date- we 'll have a new set of projects in your community for you to choose from . <h> How it all works <p> Each time members buy a Co-op branded product and swipe their membership card , they earn 5% for themselves to spend at the Co-op and 1% for their community . They can choose which local cause their 1% goes towards . <p> And things are going well . At the time of posting , Co-op members have raised over -4 million for local causes . Co-op supports up to 3 local causes in over 1,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we 're getting on on our local community fund page . <p> We talk about the 5% and 1% stuff regularly on the blog but we have n't spoken in much detail about how everything works behind the scenes . So here 's what happens next . <h> Paying out after 6 months <p> At the end of each day a member 's 1% balance is checked and one of 2 things happen . If a member has selected a cause , the 1% earned goes into that pot . If they have n't , the funds stay put in an unallocated pot . <p> At the end of the 6-month cycle we 'll do the number crunching . Then we 'll split the 1% balances for anyone- who did n't choose a cause equally between the causes in their community . We 'll then send the sums over to the Charities Aid Foundation ( CAF ) and they 'll process the payment so each local cause gets what they 're due . <h> See where your money 's going <p> Very soon we 'll have a new page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . The page will show a list of the causes that you 've supported . From here you 'll be able to see how much you 've contributed as well as- revisit the profile pages of the local causes to see how much they raised . <h> A new set of projects from local causes <p> If you 're a member you 'll carry on supporting the cause you chose until 8 April or until you choose a different one . On 9 April however , we 'll have a new set of projects from local causes for you to choose to give your 1% to . Between November and January , local causes applied to be part of the new round of funding . Since then we 've checked the applications are eligible and have given our colleagues a say in which local causes they want to be part of the Local Community Fund . <p> Board meeting for the whole group , they 've seen our preparation , our presentation for the year , very happy with that , lots of good challenge . <p> For us as a team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advisory Board met this Wednesday , we have 4 advisers , Jonathan Luff , who is helping us with our horizon scanning and vendor market place review ; Jeni Tennison from the Open Data Institute and Andrew Eland from Google Deep Mind , those 2 are really helping us with our data services and our open data principles and standards work . And Sophie Fenwick-Paul who 's helping us with our communities and our futures work , particularly helping Rufus around membership and community . <p> Those 4 constitute our Advisory Board and I 'm delighted they are helping us . We are also looking for at least one other person to help us with our e-commerce development around our electrical business , so if you know anybody please let us know . <p> And just a couple of stats this week to wrap up . I 'm delighted that at the end of the period of our community cause programme , we 've had over 6000 applications from causes , charities , social programmes all over the country who want to participate in the 1% programme . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years . <p> We 've now got some sifting work to do because we were very , very much oversubscribed , but we should have causes in every part of our country and in every one of our 1500 communities , so that 's a great achievement . <p> And finally membership continues to grow . The Join Us campaign is starting to make an impact and last week we had over 30,000 new members join the Co-op . So that 's some great stats , I hope to give you some more next week , but until then , join us . <p> ThoughtWorks have been leading our product delivery teams .

And that 's really important in a cooperative . <h> Talking policy <p> The Social Media team has begun working with our Food Policy team to group online mentions into related topics . The idea behind the collaboration is that we 'll make more informed policy decisions the more we listen . <p> We 've started splitting mentions into the different areas of policy . They are : <p> Agriculture anything to do with farming and how crops and animals are raised and looked after <h> Listening in <p> Using a social media listening tool called Brandwatch , we 're picking up instances when people are talking about Co-op and our grocery competitors .

That figure includes things about our competitors as well as things about our own grocery business . <h> We 're listening . Now we can start learning <p> We 've begun to analyse the data . During #FairtradeFortnight in March , Co-op announced our commitment to 100% Fairtrade cocoa in all own brand products from May 2017 . The announcement was a big deal and we saw it dominate online conversation related to ethical trade during those weeks . In fact , Co-op represented 50% of the conversation while our grocery competitors combined made up the other 50% . <p> The orange line represents daily conversation about Co-op and ethical trade so far in 2017 .

The more we learn , the better the decisions we 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Welcome to week 11 update from Co-op Digital . Start off with a big number . Six months ago we launched the new membership scheme for the Co-op . This week we passed 700,000 new members . Great effort from the Membership team and everyone across the Co-op Group to roll out the service . Its great seeing members come back to the Co-op . <p> I want to talk about 4- things we 've done this week . <p> First is in Funeralcare where in our Edinburgh hub we 've rolled out the new digital service that 's transforming that business following on from our Bolton work . There 's an event here in Manchester next week , you 're more than welcome to come to that to talk about how were digitising the Funeralcare business . more information below <p> Our wills service has been handed back right into that wills business which is now taking more and more of our transactions digitally . <p> And our coop.co.uk site and our corporate sites have had a refresh from Peter Brumby and the team . They look great . <p> Final thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our Food business and you 'll see on our blog the reception that our store managers give when we give them these great digital tools and services . You 're going to see more of that . <p> A couple of quick shout outs this week . Rebekah Cooper who 's joined our team is now reverse mentoring Steve Murrells , our CEO . Its great to see our leadership team welcome digital in and taking the advice from a younger generation . <p> And also were helping Liverpool Geek Girls and sponsoring them as they come through and take part in this community here in Manchester . <p> And it would be remiss of me not to finish with the usual " were hiring . " Weve got some great opportunities so do check out our blog and see if you can come and join the team . <p> We set up the Co-op Member Voice team to , well , give Co-op members a voice . We 've been engaging with members both online and in their communities in many ways . We 've asked them to join in ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've arranged community dog walks and we 've done an awful lot of baby talk ! <p> By speaking and listening to our customers and members , we 've got a better chance of both meeting their needs and giving them what they 'd like . <p> One of our first Member Voice engagements was when we gave 100 active members in Holmfirth 6 bottles of wine so they could host their own wine tasting event . We asked for their thoughts and used their recommendations and tasting notes in point of sale material in- the Holmfirth store . All 6 types of wine saw an increase in sales when the member testimonies were seen by customers . <p> One of our most popular opportunities was when we asked members about their favourite local real ales . Over 900 members waxed lyrical about their favourite local tipples and you can see what we learnt on the main Co-op blog . <h> Try the beer , write the tasting notes <p> We had a big response to these opportunities so in January we invited 100 members- to taste 3 brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triple Hop and Golden Ale . We asked members to taste them and tell us what they thought for the chance to see- their tasting notes on the labels . <p> Itll be interesting to see if members and customers react to the- member comments on the packaging- keeping in mind- the successes of the Holmfirth wine trial on local wine sales . <h> Beer sampling on social <p> As you can imagine it did n't take long for the 100 cases to get snapped up . Members were thrilled to be asked to taste and give their thoughts on our new beers and ales and took to Twitter to share what they were doing . You can see some of their tweets by searching #coopjoinin . <p> The 100 tasters then filled in a survey about the beers and the Beers , Wines and Spirits team chose a comment about each beer that would be printed on the corresponding bottle . <p> The Golden Ale tasting notes were from Michael Gibbons , a Co-op member from Luton. - <p> Sam Dineley , a Co-op member from Bristol wrote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from Tom Packman , a Co-op member from Essex . <h> A meet-up in a brewery <p> We invited the 3 members whose notes were chosen to Frederick Robinson 's Brewery where we make and bottle the ales . After a full brewery tour , we were taken to the bottling plant to see the Triple Hop bottles coming down the line and being filled and packaged ready to head to our Co-op Food stores . Then we tasted some of Robinson 's customer favourites , along with the fresh off the line Triple Hop . <p> The Co-op ales go on sale in our Co-op Food stores on 13 March and our members voices are shouting loud and proud from the label ! <p> You can- join in with a Member Voice opportunity by logging into your Co-op Membership account . <p> The Co-op is committed to being radically transparent . A decade ahead of the government 's traffic light system , we campaigned for food and nutrition labelling that 's clear and easy to understand . <p> Being transparent still matters . But how do we make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to building trust from transparency in the digital age ? <p> For the past 12 weeks , my team has been working on a proof of concept we called the Provenance alpha . Provenance is a start-up that uses blockchain technology to make supply chains more transparent . A blockchain is a public , tamper-proof record of transactions which is maintained and verified by a network of co-operating computers ( rather than by a central authority like a bank ) . <p> The Provenance alpha was a joint effort between Co-op Digital and Provenance to see if we could use their technology without having to add extra steps to our supply chain . <h> Starting with gladioli <p> Our small team ( myself , interaction designer Jack , and the team from Provenance ) tracked gladioli through our supply chain , from source to shelf . We learnt a lot in the process . We worked on this project in the same way that we develop software by building something doable as a basis for scaling up . <p> We looked at the supply chains of 4 different products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relatively neutral product but still perishable . Gladioli are farmed locally in the UK and move from source to shelf in 2 to 5 days . Their supply chain has enough steps to be interesting , but is small enough for a proof of concept . <h> Working with what 's already there <p> We wanted to move quickly , which meant steering clear of changing- existing processes in the supply chain . Adding any new technology for tracking and verification purposes would be expensive to scale , so we avoided doing that . To keep us on track , we decided on some principles for our work. - <p> Tracking should be as close to real time as possible . <p> No manipulation of existing supply chain processes . <p> Use existing systems and verifiable data . <p> We connected to existing systems such as our suppliers ' sales and invoice software and our warehouse management system at our depot . This let us collect data about where the flowers had come from and where they 'd go next . It also let us track unique batches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suppliers in the supply chain gave us access to systems that we could extract data from . This data included evidence of environmental and welfare standards . We then linked these together using Provenance 's software to verify the batch of gladioli at each step in the chain . <p> We started off by meeting with the gladioli farmer , Matthew Naylor to find the number of flowers cropped in the field each day . This information is usually recorded on paper , however Matthew used his smartphone to log the daily cropping figures with the Provenance system . <p> Next , we met with our flower supplier , JZ Flowers . They supply the Co-op with British gladioli and work with Matthew and the Co-op 's flowers product manager , Kathryn Camps , to develop our flower range . The information we collected about the production process is in the Provenance app . At this point we used order , sales and invoicing data to verify the batches that were sent to our depot . Then , at the depot we used our warehouse management systems to track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archway Co-op . <h> Thinking about data <p> Our progress has given us the confidence that , despite the many challenges of scaling , this idea is something that 's worth looking into further . It 's also made us think about the wealth of data we could collect . It could be possible to collect information on : <p> nutrition <p> allergens <p> ingredients <p> origin and food miles <p> sustainability information , for example CO2 emissions <p> welfare <p> price per unit <p> All of this data already exists but within data silos ' across different systems , organisations and processes . We 're thinking about how we could collect it , standardise it and make it open and accessible to teams . If we could , it 'd be possible for teams to build products and services that help our members and customers understand their food better . It would also help colleagues be more informed . Of course , this would be a huge project because the Co-op sells so many products and often introduces new ones . <p> Our small team completed the Provenance alpha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems . For a proof of concept , that was very important . <p> Our next step will be to find out if there 's a user need for a digital right to know ' for our products. - We 'd be interested to hear if it 's something you 'd care about , and to what extent .

My teams speak to thousands of our members and customers every day in our member and customer contact centre . <p> Claire Carroll <p> One of the most common calls to our stores and our customer care team is whether or not a particular product is stocked in a store . Our stores stock slightly different products because : <p> they are different sizes <p> customers in different locations have different needs <p> When we get calls about what products are in a particular store , it takes the team a little time to find the answer . Advisers needed to look in a few different places for the information . The system we used was clunky , taking around 10 minutes to locate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would often tell customers that they would need to call customers back . This was a poor experience for our members , customers and colleagues . <p> One of the chosen alphas was Product Range Finder . The alpha project was to build a simple prototype , allowing my team to have a single tool to use when answering queries on product range , and to see if this tool improved our efficiency and experience . <p> The new prototype is much easier to use than the old system and provides more information . For example , it tells customers how many stores stock a particular product , and how many of those stores are in a 15 mile radius from them . <p> Product Range Finder showing list view of the products , and how many stores stock the listed productProduct Range Finder map view of stores that stock the product selected <p> We receive 200 queries a month about finding product ranges . The prototype saves us approximately 10 minutes on each one . This equates to an extra 7 hours a week . <p> We 've found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of hours . We did n't want any down time during the day . <p> My team 's enjoyed working as part of the product team to test the prototype and suggest improvements . The advisors have loved being the experts and have been amazed how quickly their feedback has led to improvements to the system . <p> Next for the product team is the beta phase . They 'll make a technically sound , scalable version of the prototype . They 'll make sure the the data feeds are right , look at adding availability information , and take some steps towards making the tool customer facing . <p> Hello , I 'm Cathryn Higgs .

We 'll continue to blog about how we 're working differently , but we also want to find other ways to share what we 're doing with all our colleagues . <p> Why would we want to share our ways of working ? We 've found that generally speaking , teams and organisations that adopt agile ways of working have a better chance of delivering the right thing , are happier and more collaborative . It 's perfectly suited to an organisation built on co-operation and doing the right thing for its people . <p> The first session was a pilot with the objective to provide an overview of digital and agile ways of working whilst gathering lots of feedback from attendees . <p> What is digital ? The habits of behaviours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager in CoopDigital . <p> We 're initially providing these sessions for colleagues in CoopDigital and will consider opening these up to other areas of Co-op in the future .

We 're trialling , learning and improving as we go . <p> We 're now reviewing the feedback to help us develop and improve the content and format for more sessions .

@@96829767 @1029767/ <p> I 'm James Antoniou , I head up the wills team at Co-op Legal Services . Over the last 10 months or so , me and my team of will writers have been working closely with James Boardwell 's team of digital specialists at Co-op Digital . Both teams wanted to make it simpler and faster to create a legally robust will for Co-op customers and by combining legal expertise and digital skills we 've done just that . <p> This is the first time I 've worked alongside a digital team but I do n't think it 'll be the last . Here are my thoughts on it . <p> James : We looked at doing a fully online , end-to-end , digital service . I had a lot of reservations in that , and I think probably most lawyers would do , because they could n't see how a computer could be a substitute for 15 years ' worth of experience . So the way we built the service was as a hybrid between being able to take the benefits of the accessibility of starting online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service took advice to make sure that what they were looking to do was , in fact , having the right legal impact of what they were actually looking to achieve . <p> So the digital way of working is something that was very new to me . I think as as a solicitor you are you 're working in an environment where you 're expected to know the answers , all the time . And coming into the digital environment , it was more about learning , and putting things to users and understanding what they 're telling us , rather than us telling them what they should know . <p> So , I think legal services and digital ; I think it 's it 's the future . I think it 's the way that legal services are going to be delivered mainstream , over the next sort of probably 5 to 10 years . I think at the moment there is limited routes to that online market . I think that plenty have tried and failed perhaps cos they 've been offered a wholly digital service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the digital channel but it 's also backed up by some robust legal guidance and advice . And I think it 's that hybrid which is where the the future of legal services lie ; because it 's not just about accessibility , it 's about making sure that that the right advice is being given . And secondly , and probably more importantly , that the customer feels that they are getting the service that 's of value to them and that they 're prepared to pay for it , and they feel that they 're protected , and that it 's something that is going to meet their needs .

If you 're watching this , go to our blog , have a look at them , comment on them and help us improve them . Those principles are about how we deal with member data and how we deal with data in the wider digital economy will be the thing that sets us apart as a co-op in the future . <p> Some numbers . Our Membership numbers keep growing . The campaign to get new members is only just starting so hopefully we 're well on track for a million new members this year . That 's brilliant . <p> And closer to home this week we had the Manchester Digital Skills Festival . It was great to see the entire team present and loads of people coming from the region who want to work with and for the Co-op and help us on our digital journey . So a brilliant week , quite a big one but we passed some big milestones . <p> But I should finish by saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warburton to come in and help us on our Membership and we 've got 2 new outstanding product managers in Anna Goss and Faith Mowbray so well keep announcing new people and we 'll keep bringing great talent to the organisation . Until next week , see you then . <p> We want to bring the Co-op difference to data . That means going beyond what is simply required by law , and instead infusing the way we collect and handle data with the Co-op 's values . <p> Practically , we want the Co-op 's data to be : correct and up to date ; secure ; available to those who need it within the Group and easy to find , understand , connect and augment . That will help us make decisions based on data . We 'll arrive at better decisions more quickly because the information we need will be easy to find and use . It will also help us spot new opportunities across the business , quickly , creating new opportunities because we are joining the dots . We 'll also be able to build better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with consistent standards can act as common language between us and them . <p> So , how do we get there ? Well , we all have a role . We 'll need to set common standards and provide tools and ways of working needed : data principles . <p> As importantly , we need to create a culture at the Co-op that is n't complacent about data and problems with data , but instead fixes those issues at source . We should think and care about how data is used once it is created . Everybody has a role to play in data . Thinking about data and asking how to use it and why will become a habit . <p> Some of this is n't new and many people at the Co-op have been doing good work for a long time . Helping and supporting those people to continue to do their jobs is important . That 's why we 've been convening and meeting with Data Leaders , and why we 're including colleagues from data teams across the business to work out what values we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data and the Co-op values <p> To help us think about this , we 've started to look at how Co-operative values like self-help , self-responsibility , solidarity and equity might manifest in data . <p> We 've come up with a Data Principles alpha to help colleagues working with data at the Co-op . The principles are based on workshops we 've had with colleagues , and we 're going to be running more user research sessions to make sure that they are relevant and helpful for colleagues at every level . We 've done a few versions of data principles , and based on colleague feedback on previous iterations we 're sharing what weve learnt- publicly . <h> Important themes <h> 1 . Data is part of everything <p> The data function does not work in isolation . Everyone does their bit to collect and create - good data , which can be used as the basis for making decisions . We are focused on what Co-op members and customers want and need , and respond to that quickly . Colleagues have the necessary tools to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spot opportunities . <h> 2 . Clarity is for everyone <p> We will communicate how we use and collect data in a way that both specialists and non-specialists can understand . We 'll use consistent terms and standards that are externally recognisable , as well as use plain English to help members meaningfully consent to how the Co-op uses their data . <h> 3 . One version of the truth <p> Major data sets will have a designated owner and steward , who is in charge of keeping them updated , accurate and complete according to defined goals . All significant data sets will be listed and visible to all staff in a Central Data Catalogue , rather than relying on local duplicate , or inconsistent versions . <h> 4 . Co-operating safely <p> We will use data across the business where appropriate and ethical . We encourage co-operating about data , safely and securely , working together for mutual benefit . <p> We 're still testing these and we 're keen to hear colleague , customer and member thoughts on them . If you have feedback on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@96829793 @1029793/ <p> Co-op Digital is helping the wider Co-op transform its business by building digital products and services . We know some of our readers have an interest in how technology and digital skills can help businesses but if they 're not part of that digital and design community they 're unlikely to be familiar with some of the terms we use in our blog posts . Soon , we 'll be publishing a post from the wills team on their minimum viable product ' so it 's worth explaining this particular term now . <p> Minimum viable product ' or MVP ' means slightly different things to different people and organisations but here 's what we mean when we talk about MVPs . <h> Defining MVP ' <p> At Co-op Digital we work in an agile ' way to deliver software because we believe it 's important to give the user value , quickly . Part of working in an agile way is releasing an MVP to help us learn what 's working and what is n't so that we can improve products quickly , cost-effectively and without needless risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release of a big concept made up of smaller features . It does n't come with a plan to add more features in the next iteration whilst also trying to fix features that do n't work . It 's not the final product either . <p> To us at Co-op Digital , an MVP is the first attempt to solve our users ' problems . It 's an experiment . It 's the smallest thing ' we think could be valuable to our members , our customers or other users . We then grow that thing based on the feedback we get from real use , by real people . <h> What 's the minimum ' bit ? <p> We want the most meaningful feedback and to do that , the product that users see must be real . But if we release loads of features at the same time it becomes difficult to work out which part of what we built was useful and which bits were n't . <p> If our end goal was making a new kind of wedding cake , we might first test with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximise our learning . We could get it into peoples hands so they could taste it and we could check the flavours and uncover any problems in our factory . With the feedback we 'd get , we could then iterate quickly , safe in the knowledge we have the right ingredients and that our oven works , and so on . At each iteration we are providing value to the customer ( cake to eat ) and value to the business ( cake to sell ) . We 'd do that rather than try to build the wedding cake straight away . <p> In other words , building an MVP is about doing the least- to learn the most . <h> Quick feedback , efficient improvement <p> Starting small means we can get a tangible product in front of users quickly , and start to observe , analyse and measure quantitatively and qualitatively . Getting started as soon as possible helps us quickly- create a feedback loop that can prove or disprove our ideas for how to improve the product . <p> Starting with an MVP is a proven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort and maximises the value for members , customers and other users . Best of all we 'll know the thing we 've done works , before we invest in building it . <h> Like this : <h> 2 thoughts on " What we mean when we talk about a minimum viable product ' " <p> Sharon KempFebruary 2 , 2017 / 6:02 pm <p> Interesting I can also see how this approach aligns to our Ways of Being in terms of Doing what matters most and being agile and minimum . Succeeding together in terms of using real people for real feedback . The experimental nature of this approach feels like were being ourselves and in terms of maximising our efforts that 's surely a good example of showing we care about member resources by investing wisely . 
@@96829799 @1029799/ <p> In November last year I moved across from Co-op Group Finance to Co-op Digital to set up a finance function . I 'm now looking for a digital finance manager to support me . I 've written this post to talk about how we work in finance at Co-op Digital and to show the difference between accountancy in a traditional environment and in a digital one . For anyone who has accountancy skills but has n't worked with digital teams before , I 'd like to give you an idea of the challenge we face when we 're juggling ( limited ) pots of cash in an agile ' environment . <h> Long term versus short term planning <p> When I moved over to Co-op Digital I knew I 'd have to adapt the way I worked because digital teams work in a different way to other areas I 'd looked after before . During the budget process , I was used to understanding everything an area of the business wanted to do that year , discussing all the costs and working up a detailed , line by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget . <p> But instead of having a detailed plan for the next year , digital teams work to much shorter timescales . They prioritise what they 'll be working on based on user needs and they reassess their priorities every 2 weeks . It 's all part of working in an agile way . A team 's budget needs to be flexible because the digital service or product changes direction as the team learns more about what the user needs . <h> Juggling pots <p> We have around 8 digital product or service teams as well as all the Data , Membership , Brand and Social Media teams . Obviously , whenever we give one team an extra slice of the budget , it has an effect on what 's left for the other teams . This means you 've got to be super proactive . You need to be really plugged in to the teams so you can find out how their plans are changing and what 's coming next so we can account for , report on and forecast costs as we go . <p> The good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with . Everyone understands the challenges we face in the finance team and we work together to overcome them . <h> Adapting to agile <p> One of the interesting areas I 've been involved in is making sure we 've got the right financial controls in place . This means giving teams the freedom they need to deliver while making sure they stay within the allocated budget . Because the Co-op has traditionally used a longer term planning approach , a lot of the controls are n't suited to an agile way of working . Obviously we need to maintain the same level of control , so we 've been working with other support and governance functions within the Co-op to come up with something that works . <p> I 've been working this way with Co-op Digital for pretty much a year now , and so far things are going well . At the beginning of 2016 we committed to meeting the existing budget , and by the end of the year , that 's what we 've done . In fact , we 've also delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do which is pretty satisfying . <h> What the job ad does n't tell you <p> Being able to balance the books for a group of teams who work in this way is really rewarding . It 's also a skill that 's likely to become more sought after as more traditional organisations start looking to digital to see how it can help make their businesses more efficient . 
@@96829800 @1029800/ <p> This is my first blog post , so a quick introduction ; I 'm Ian , and I look after the digital team 's corporate relations and partnerships , ensuring we have the right skills , resources and people to deliver our plans . <p> It 's no secret that finding and securing the best digital talent is important for many organisations , including the Co-op . <p> Simply put , there is n't enough to go around . Addressing this is the domain of people like Makers ' Academy , who think the solution is to find a way for more developers to enter the market . They offer a 12-week intensive course , taking people through a curriculum which they believe results in job-ready junior developers . More than 600 people have completed the course so far . That number is growing . They 've now introduced remote learning too . <p> I 'm delighted that the 170 year-old Co-op was so well received by this group of Shoreditch based digital natives . They were interested not only in our digital plans and our ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values and the advantages of membership . We talked to them about some of the incredibly interesting problems we have to solve , bringing benefits to our colleagues , members and communities . <p> One of the founding principles of the Co-op is helping our members to help themselves , so we also need to determine what this means for us in a digital age . We hope the chance to help Co-op solve those problems attracts some great people . It certainly seems to be working so far . <p> It seems it 's not just us who are excited by these prospects , also new digital professionals looking for a challenge can see the potential in the Co-op .

As long as membership comms is seen as another avenue for PR the uptake will be limited . Good luck . <p> I just hope you can pursuade the Group to move from asking how can we get our pre-planned messages to people ? to what are people looking for that we can provide ? . If you separate the Membership engagement from the PR communication channel and hand more control to members , then this could be very exciting indeed .
