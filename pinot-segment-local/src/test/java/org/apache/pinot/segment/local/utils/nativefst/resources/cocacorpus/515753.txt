On the surface , Oyster and Contactless cards both seem to fulfil the same purpose : quick , convenient and cheap travel around London , any time you like . While Oyster cards do need to be topped up with tickets or cash , both can be swiped at the station and send you on your way- and with caps on each , it seems like there should n't be too much competition between the two . <p> However , with the recent- announcement by the London Assembly Labour group that Oyster card users could pay over -100 more than contactless card users in regular journeys across the capital , the issue has been raised as to which is the better method of payment : Oyster Pay as You Go , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standard.co.uk <h> The Announcement <p> The announcement came out recently that Oyster Cards , due to their daily cap rather than a weekly one , could easily pay over -100 more than contactless card users travelling the same journey .

If you were travelling several times across zones 1-3 from Monday to Thursday , Oyster PAYG and Contactless would cost the same , around -40 . That being the case , just travelling to and from work with a Contactless card wo n't save you any money at all- itll be the same whichever you use . <p> It should be noted that part-timers will be receiving a big benefit in the coming year- London Mayor Boris Johnson has announced plans to lower daily caps for PAYG customers , meaning that those who travel around London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits that weekly Travelcard holders receive , saving -2 a day over the current fees . <p> However , Transport for London DOES recommend using a contactless card as opposed to Oyster PAYG in certain cases .

But if you do n't often see your team play live or you 're heading to an away ground , how do you know which pubs will be friendly and which will be full of opposition fans ? <p> Here is a guide to the best pubs you can enjoy a pre-match ale at , whether you 're a home or away fan visiting the Premier League 's top London clubs . <h> Arsenal <p> For Arsenal fans : <p> If you 're an Arsenal fan and you 're looking for somewhere to drink before ( or after ) the match , there are a number of popular options to choose from . The Twelve Pins- is a large pub that is used to large crowds and has a great atmosphere on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch , the pub has two big screens raised high , so you can watch even when it 's busy . It 's about 15 minutes from the ground and right next to the Finsbury Park station . <p> Away supporters tend to head to the Drayton Park pub which is based close to the Drayton Park railway station . It 's very busy on match days due to its proximity to the stadium . The aforementioned Twelve Pins and nearby Blackstock are both away-fan friendly , although you might expect a little banter . <h> Chelsea <p> For Chelsea fans : <p> Chelsea 's fans have had to battle the gentrification of their home turf as many of the traditional home fans ' pubs " the Rising Sun , the So Bar , the Wheatsheaf " turned into supermarkets or cocktail bars . Instead you 'll have to choose from options such as The Finborough Arms , The Chelsea Pensioner or The Butcher 's Hook . <p> The Chelsea Pensioner <p> For away fans : <p> Due to the fact that Chelsea fans do n't have a go-to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Stamford Bridge will be crammed with Chelsea fans on match days . Unless you 're planning on visiting incognito it 's probably worth hopping off a couple of tube stops early , for example , at the Earl 's Court station , where you can find some good options such as the Courtfield or the Blackbird . <h> Crystal Palace <p> For Crystal Palace fans : <p> There are a number of different pubs close to Selhurst Park . If you want to drink close to the stadium then The Clifton Arms is a popular choice . You could also opt for The Cherry Trees which both cater to home fans . If you 'd prefer somewhere a little less packed , try heading up to the centre of Crystal Palace where you 'll find The White Hart and the Westow House " both of which are nice pubs . <p> The Clifton Arms <p> For away fans : <p> Away supporters should probably avoid the pubs that are very close to the stadium unless they are happy to stifle their conversations about their team . A Wetherspoon pub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandes welcomes both home and away supporters and generally getting further away from the stadium makes you more likely to find a good option that is n't filled with Palace fans . <h> Tottenham <p> For Spurs fans : <p> The Bricklayers is the classic option for Spurs fans on match days and the only choice if you 're going for the real White Hart Lane experience . Of course it 's worth noting that the pub is excruciatingly busy leading up to the game and ca n't be recommended if you 're not willing to wrestle your way to the bar for a beer . Much larger is the No.8 Tottenham ( previously known as the Bell &amp; Hare ) which is equally close to the ground but can be relied upon for easier access to the pints . <p> The Bricklayers <p> For away fans : <p> The Elmhurst is a pub that 's fairly close to the ground and is away-fan friendly . But the area also suffers from the problem of traditional football pubs turning into swanky boutiques and upmarket restaurants . It 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a drink where you 'll find more pubs catering to you . <h> West Ham <p> For West Ham fans : <p> Since moving to their new stadium , West Ham fans are still finding their feet in terms of pubs . When the club was based at Upton Park , the Boleyn Tavern was the obvious choice for Hammers fans . With " supposedly " the largest horseshoe bar in London , this was the traditional meeting place for supporters before the match . While this is still a great choice for your pre-match drinks , it 's not exactly next door anymore since West Ham 's move to the former Olympic Stadium . <p> The Cow <p> For away fans : <p> The Stratford Westfield is a shopping centre close to the Olympic Park which has a large pub called The Cow which could be worth visiting for away fans . <p> A bit about Mike : <p> The above guide is provided by Mike James , a die-hard Hammer working with Soccer Box a jersey , replica-kit and football clothing specialist .

@@80309091 @1809091/ <h> 5 CV Mistakes You Should Avoid <h> Bag that job interview ! <p> CV writing can be tough . Not only do you have to demonstrate your key skills and expertise , but you have to do it against some stiff competition ! Most employers receive hundreds , sometimes thousands , of applications for every job role they advertise . Last year supermarket giant Tesco received 4,300 applications for 150 job openings they were advertising " that 's around 30 applications for every vacancy ! <p> With so much competition on the job market , it 's now more important than ever to get the initial CV writing process perfect . So with this in mind , we wanted to look at 5- common CV mistakes and offer some tips on how you can avoid them and hopefully improve your chances of securing a job interview . <h> #1 Too Long <p> There 's no doubt about it " no matter how interesting your vast work experience may be , a CV can be too long . Employers allocate a short amount of time to look through CVs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if they are faced with a CV that is pages and pages long , then it 's unlikely they 'll want to read it . Employers need to get to the key information on a CV as quickly as possible . Find out ways to- shorten your lengthy CV . <p> Tip:Remember " a CV is designed to entice an employer and to prompt them to want to find out more about your expertise . It 's not designed to tell them your entire career story , so keep it short and sweet " two pages or less if you can . <h> #2 Too Short <p> Although a CV can be too long , a CV that is too short can be equally damaging to your job interview prospects . If your CV does n't have much information or experience on it then how can an employer assess whether you have the credentials to succeed in the role ? <p> Tip : When you are writing your CV ensure you include all of the key information and if you are struggling to fill out the work experience section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to boost your CV content , gain experience and you can also meet valuable industry contacts . <p> 1 page CV <h> #3 Spelling Mistakes <p> If there 's one CV mistake that irritates employers the most it 's this . Sending a CV out with spelling or grammatical errors indicates that you have n't put much time and effort into your CV writing and you are not that interested in the job role . <p> Tip : Before you send your CV to an employer , print it out and proof read it several times to spot any mistakes and correct them before you send it off . <h> #4 Writing a Generic CV <p> As employers receive multiple applications for every job role they advertise , it 's crucial that you make yours stand out from the competition . If you write a generic CV that does n't relate to the employer and send it out to a handful of vacancies , then every recruiter that reads your CV will find it hard to visualise the impact you could have on their company . <p> Tip : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities in mind and relate these to your previous positions to demonstrate why you are the right person for the job . <h> #5 Poor Design <p> You might think that concentrating on the content of your CV is the only task when writing one , and although it 's certainly essential , you also need to consider the design . A scruffy or disorganised CV will send a recruiter running for the hills so ensure yours is laid out well and that it 's all in order . <p> Tip:Organise your CV . Include your most recent job role at the top of the work experience section , use sub-headings to organise each section and consider using a professional CV design to add extra visual-impact.

This year , instead of panicking , I recommend taking in the atmosphere of London 's many Christmas Markets . With so many to choose from , you will find a gift for everybody as you soak up the magical atmosphere and are dazzled by the amazing light creations . Here are my picks for the festive season : <h> #1 Hyde Park Winter Wonderland 21st of November 4th of January <p> Every year I count down to Winter Wonderland . It is one of my favourite London events each year . From the 21st of November until the 4th of January one corner of Hyde Park is transformed into a magical wonderland complete with ice-skating , a giant observation wheel , Zippos Circus and magical ice kingdom . There are two traditional Christmas markets at Winter Wonderland " the Angels and Yuletide Markets so there is plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance into the park is free it will take someone with a lot more willpower than me to resist the temptation of the traditional Bavarian food and drink , mulled wine , funfair and novelty gifts . Maybe this year someone will get me a gingerbread heart ? <h> #2 Covent Garden at Christmas 6th November 2nd January <p> If Winter Wonderland is my favourite Christmas market then my favourite area at this time is Covent Garden . There is always something quite magical about the way it is decorated . The decorations this year include Londons biggest and brightest hand-picked Christmas tree , a giant 22-feet tall silver reindeer and 150,000 sparkling pea lights " a Santa made from 700,000 LEGO bricks . Every Saturday there are live reindeer for the young ( and young at heart ) to meet and pet as well as a wide range of other activities . As far as markets go , the Real Food Market gets a Christmas makeover and the Apple Market will be selling unique Christmas gifts . <h> #3 Southbank Centre Christmas Market 11th of November 4th of January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling over the festive season then look no further than the Queen 's Walk on the Southbank . From the 11th of November until the 4th of January the walkway will be lined with 80 wooden chalets selling all sorts of Christmas goodies . There will be handmade items such as wooden ties and fake snow for you to fill the stockings with , mulled wine and traditional German snacks . The market is all part of the Southbank Centre 's Winter Festival which also includes a Chocolate Festival , Real Food Christmas Market and a Designers/Makers Christmas Market . And , if that 's not enough , there will be two choir performances each day . Finally I would suggest you keep walking along the river to the Christmas Market outside the Tate Modern , its marvelous. <h> #4 Christmas at Kew Gardens 26th November 3th January <p> If you want to escape the madness of the busier Christmas markets then head to the Illuminated Trail at Kew Gardens . Take a walk through the illuminated trail as it makes its way through the world-famous botanic gardens .

@@80309109 @1809109/ <h> Get Paid When Your Flight Is Delayed <h> How to Claim Compensation when your Flight is Delayed <p> If your flight has been delayed then you could be entitled to cash compensation . The law can be a bit complicated and not very well publicised which has resulted in only about 1-2% of people getting the compensation they are entitled to . Hopefully this handy guide will make it easier to get the compensation you are due . <h> #1 What are my rights if my flight is delayed ? <p> EC261 is a law that all EU members must abide by . It states that air passengers must be financially compensated if their flight is cancelled or overbooked . Additionally , since 2012 , this law has been extended to include passengers whose flight has been delayed by three hours or more . <h> #2 When may I not be entitled to claim compensation ? <p> Pic : dailymail.co.uk <p> An airline does not have to pay you compensation if the delay is due to extraordinary circumstances . These circumstances can include : <p> weather conditions <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> airport staff going on strike <p> a medical emergency or some crew issues <p> Also , if your delayed flight happened more than six years ago you will not be entitled for compensation . <p> EC261 is a European law so it only applies if you are travelling from an EU airport or with an EU airline ( including Iceland , Norway or Switzerland ) . This chart ( source : airhelp.com ) should help with any confusion : <p> Airline and Origin <p> EU Airline <p> Non-EU Airline <p> From outside EU to outside EU <p> No <p> No <p> From outside EU to inside EU <p> Yes <p> No <p> From inside EU to outside EU <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> From inside EU to inside EU <p> Yes <p> Yes <h> #3 How much compensation can I claim ? <p> Pic : www.telegraph.co.uk <p> The compensation that you are entitled to depends on the length of the flight and the amount of time that you are delayed for . The amount can vary from G250-G600 per person . The table below ( source : travelsupermarket.com ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to : <p> Length of flight <p> Delay to destination* <p> Compensation due <p> Up to 1500km <p> More than 3 hours <p> G250 <p> 1500 to 3500km <p> More than 3 hours <p> G400 <p> More than 3500km <p> More than 3 hours but less than 4 hours <p> G300 <p> More than 3500km <p> More than 4 hours <p> G600 <p> *The delay to destination is counted from the time that you arrive at your destination , not your departure time . <p> Remember that this compensation is in addition to customer care that should be provided by the airline while you wait . This is sometimes referred to as a welfare package ' and includes : <p> Refreshments <p> Food <p> Accommodation ( if the flight is delayed overnight ) <p> Transport ( to accommodation ) <p> Phone call <h> #4 How can I claim compensation ? <p> The best way to claim compensation is by contacting the airline directly . You can ask them the reasons for the delay and how to make a claim . If the airline does not have a required contact method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending a letter ( take a copy ) or email " it is always best to put it in writing so you have a record of any communication between you and the airline . You will need to put as much information as possible into the letter/email so using a template from the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) would be a good idea . You may also be asked to provide other evidence like bank/credit card statements , luggage tags , receipts from the airport and passport stamps . <p> The Money Saving Expert website also has some really useful tools to use if your flight is delayed . Firstly , you can use their template letter if you are going to email/write to the airline . Alternatively , MSE work with Resolver ( a complaints firm ) to help you get the compensation you are due . This free online tool drafts the complaint letter for you , keeps track of the complaint and let 's you know if you have a response , and helps you if you need to escalate the claim ( for example , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response ) . <p> There are also a number of companies online who can help you make your claim for compensation . Two of the most well-known are AirHelp and refund.me . <h> AirHelp Let them do the work for you <p> Pic : airhelp.com <p> AirHelp can help you in 2 ways " you can enter your flight information ( flight number , departure , arrival , etc. ) and they will then check whether you are eligible for compensation and process the claim for you . Alternatively , if you enter your email details into their website , they can scan your inbox and see if there are any eligible flights . You can use AirHelp even if you have had already had a claim denied by the airline . Unfortunately , the service offered by AirHelp does n't come for free " they will take 25% off anything you win . <h> Refund They- fight for your rights <p> Pic : www.refund.me <p> refund.me works in a similar way " you just provide them with all of the relevant information and they will write up a claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your compensation as quickly as possible .

Simply visit their website to make a flight delay compensation claim and they will handle all aspects of your case from start to finish . And same as the above they will only charge a 25% fee if you win . <h> #5 Is there anything else I need to know before I claim compensation ? <p> Remember that the compensation needs to come from a European airline operator . So if you booked a flight to the USA through British Airways but the flight was operated by American Airlines then you will not be entitled to compensation under the law EC261 . <p> There might be some cases where the airline offers you compensation in the form of vouchers . You do not have to accept these ! The law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using a claims company to claim compensation may seem a lot easier but I would personally try and do it yourself first . The process seems pretty uncomplicated so why pay out some of the money that you 're entitled to ? <p> If your flight has been delayed by 3 hours or more then you should claim compensation just imagine how many more flights you could book with G600 !

Take some time to practice on quieter roads before you launch yourself into the throng of central London traffic , although sometimes quieter roads ( where there are no other vehicles to follow ) can be even more confusing .

However , it may as well be renamed the year of TFL if things carry on the way they are at the moment . First the Night Tube , then extra Night Buses and now this : a reduced , bus hopping fare . The bus hopper fare will allow thrifty travelers to catch two buses within a one hour period and only pay for one . Not only does this include buses , however , but it also includes trams , so travel away to your hearts content ! <p> The fare is due to come into practice on the 12th September and will work on both Oyster and contactless cards . Unfortunately , at the moment , you can not combine this fare with other TFL journeys , e.g. you cant take a bus , a tube and then another bus as the technology is not quite in place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 2018 . Until then , you 'll just have to bear with the bus ! <p> London Red Bus Pixbay <p> So , what are the implications of this fare ? Well , between October and December 2015 last year , 600 million bus journeys were taken around the capital , travelling more than 100 million miles . When this fare comes into place , the mayors office estimates that 30 million journeys will be made using the fare . This plan , which has been in the works since 2009 , is already incredibly successful in several other European countries , such as Paris , Rome and Brussels so we have high hopes for it here ! Of course , people have- got to- work , trying to realise the longest route its possible to get away with . So far , the record is almost 35 miles and from the 12th September , you 'll be able to give it a go for yourself ! <p> What ? : - A new , bus hopping fare.When ? : - The fare comes into practice on the 12th September.Where ? : - Across the bus and tram network .

We do get it- you feel like you 're at home , cause you are at home ! So whenever you get hungry you will pop up to the kitchen and eat whatever you find in front of you , you will spend half a day on Facebook- chatting like you have no work to do and after eating you may take a short nap to recharge your batteries ( which by the way are probably charged ) . Why is that ? Cause you do n't  have someone always on your back checking what you are doing . So if you have agreed with your boss to work some days per month from home , or you are self employed/freelancer earning money online or as an entrepreneur , follow these 5+5 tips from personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when working from home . <h> #1 Wake up early <p> Pretend that you have to go to the office . Wake up the same time as usual and not a minute later . I know that you will not need to commute so why not spending a bit more time at your comfy bed right ? Its better to wake up the same time as always when you go to the office and have some time for yourself before starting working . You can check out what 's happening at your favourite blogs and websites , cook a nice breakfast and eat like a king , do some morning exercise that will bring energy and freshness to your body and soul . The idea is to do something and not spend more time in bed ! Studies have shown that one simple snooze can seriously mess up your day and energy . So always keep in mind this : You snooze you lose ! <p> you snooze you lose <h> #2 Have a schedule and stick to it <p> So you do n't  like planning ? Then you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a schedule . It can be good to spend some time in the morning while you drink your cup of coffee/tea drawing up your schedule for the day . Think about how can you be productive during the day and visualize the perfect day . That way , when you would fall into bed at the end of the day , you 'll feel completely fulfilled ! Set tasks and deadlines that will help you keep track of what you are doing and at the end of the day feel good with yourself and with what you have achieved ( and enjoy a pint to celebrate the fact that you conquered your lazier side ) . Finally follow the same behavioral patterns that you have when at the office . If you drink 2 coffees in 8 hours of work then you should do the same if you work from home . If you eat once during lunch time then you should do the same at home , and so on and so on . <p> Making coffee in the morning <h> - #3- Think that your boss is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this may sound a bit weird and spooky and you might feel a bit uncomfortable with the whole idea . However , if you have a good imagination this can totally work . By thinking that you are being watched you are more focused and you do n't  check on FB and Twitter every single second for updates , cause guess what ? Your boss is over your shoulder checking up on you ! For those who do n't  have a boss just imagine a demanding and a bit of a prick boss that will want you to finish tasks on time . <h> #4 Clear this to-do list <p> This is a motivation boost technique . So let 's assume that you have some tasks that you postpone every single day or week . It could be because you lack time , or cause you 're afraid of the results . You should keep in mind that if these tasks are important you should take them out of your to-do list asap ! This way you will be less stressed , as you will have fewer tasks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time you will also get free up some time for new tasks that you can take over . So , if you have a bunch of things that you SHOULD do or SHOULD have done ages ago , pick 2 from that list and add them in your daily schedule . Believe me , by doing so at the end of the day you will feel like you have done more than usual and therefore you will feel like a BOSS who would love to hire or even promote yourself ! <p> To Do List <h> #5 Have a timetable including a lunch break , and smaller 5-10 minute breaks <p> If you have a flexible schedule and you do n't need to work strictly from 9am to 5pm then you can set your own timeframe . For example , if you know that after having lunch you need at least 2 hours to get back on track and be productive then you might want to chill out for 2 hours instead of the classic 1 hour lunch break and work and finish work 1 later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you 're the master of the house , so most of the times you set the rules . However , commit yourself to specific hours the same as you do when you work at the office . So , if you normally work 8-9 hours then fix your schedule in that way that you will work the same amount of hours . <p> To-do list <h> 5 Extra Tips for Extra Effectiveness <p> Here are some more tips that will help you change your mindset and be more productive . <h> #1 Dress to impress ( yourself ) <p> Dress the same as you do when going to the office and do n't stay with your pajamas ( if you normally wear a suit then you actually do n't  need to wear the whole thing ) . The above mentioned tips are about changing your mindset to feel like you are at the office and be more productive . Do you often go to work with your pajamas ? I do n't think so ! <h> #2 Go get some fresh air <p> After having lunch get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your local park , take some fresh air and chill a bit on a bench while watching people passing by . This will calm you down , you will feel closer to nature and you will also not feel like some cave-dwelling hermit far away from the human race . <h> #3- Have a chat <p> Working from home can make you feel lonely . Stay in touch with your colleagues through Skype or through Google chat and if you live close to the office you can also pop in during lunch time to eat together with them and have a chat . <h> #4 Do it as always <p> If you tend to bring home-made sandwiches to the office to eat in-between lunch breaks then you should do the same when working from home . Prepare the sandwich as usual , the previous night or early at the morning before starting to work . <h> #5 Go grab a drink to- congratulate yourself <p> If you manage to stick to the above tips then after finishing work you need to celebrate about doing something particular and exciting ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust me , most people ca n't ! So go and enjoy a cold pint of beer .

You have probably noticed that London job hunting has become increasingly more challenging in recent years . Gone are the days of going in for one interview , acing it , and then getting the job . Many companies are now using psychometric testing as part of the recruitment process . Do n't worry if you are a little bit confused about what a psychometric test ' is ; so is everyone else . Each company uses the term psychometric test ' to refer to a different form of assessment . This is primarily because psychometric testing is an umbrella term that labels all tests used by employers to assess a candidate 's potential job performance . Psychometric testing encompasses three main areas : aptitude tests , behavioural tests , and assessment centre exercises . Let 's take a deeper look into each of these sub-categories . <h> Aptitude Tests <p> Aptitude tests measure a candidate 's overall knowledge , reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most aptitude tests are given online under time constraints . Depending on the company and the position you are applying for , you may face a different battery of tests . There are hundreds of different assessments , so just because you took an assessment for one company does not mean you should expect to see the same test at a different company . Most employers use different assessment companies , and each assessment providers exams feature different content , styles , and formats . Here are some examples of common aptitude tests : <p> Error Checking Test : - This is a technical aptitude test which requires you to review information and find mistakes . <p> Get the job you want <h> Behavioural Tests <p> Behavioural tests are used to gain insight into a candidate 's personality and how it fits a potential position . Behavioural tests , unlike aptitude tests , are usually untimed and lengthy . There are two different kinds of behavioural tests : personality tests- and situational judgement tests . <h> Personality Tests <p> Personality tests are an extremely common tool used by employers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by companies to help sift out candidates and to find those applicants who would be a right match for the company . Personality tests give an employer a feel of what the candidate 's personality profile is . <h> Situational Judgement Tests <p> A situational judgement test measures your ability to make thoughtful decisions . During this assessment , you are provided with hypothetical work-related scenarios for which you must provide solutions . You will be presented with options for potential resolutions , and required to choose the best course of action . <h> Assessment Centre <p> The assessment centre is usually the final step in the hiring process . An- assessment centre- is often a full-day activity that is made up of a combination of interviews , individual tasks , and group exercises . Depending on the employer , the assessment centre can take place at the company 's offices or at a private testing centre . The purpose of these exercises is to provide your future employer with an overview of your interpersonal skills . Most assessment centre days consist of any or all of the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or In-Tray Exercise <p> Group Exercise <p> Interviews <h> Psychometric Tests <p> Before attending the assessment centre day , you will most likely be asked to take a combination of psychometric tests . Even though you previously completed these exams , most employers require you to retake them for verification purposes . These verify tests are usually shorter than the original exam . That being said , you should still make sure you review for this shorter version of the exam . <h> Case Study <p> The case study portion of the assessment centre presents you with a brief , ranging from about 5 " 15 pages , to review . The information on the brief varies based on the position you are applying for , but it will always relate to the job . You are required to analyse the case and make professional decisions based on the information . <h> E-tray and In-Tray Exercises <p> Depending on the company , you may either be presented with a paper-based in-tray exercise or a computer-based e-tray exercise . In this type of exercise , you are provided with a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the company and your role . The focus of this task is not necessarily how you answer a message but rather how you manage your time and prioritise tasks . Part of the challenge is that you are given too many emails to answer in the given time . Therefore , do n't try to finish everything . At the end of the exercise , you should be able to defend why you made each of your decisions . <h> Group Exercises <p> During the group exercise , you are expected to either create a project or reach a conclusion based on information . Everyone in the group is provided with a personal role and information that only they are given , in addition to the information provided to the group as a whole . The point of this activity is to see how you perform in a group . The outcome of the exercise is less important . Rather , the assessors are looking to see which role you take in the group . <h> Interviews <p> Interviews are a great way for you to let your personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interview process works on assessment day . Therefore , you should be prepared to face any/all of the following types of interviews : competency interview , panel interview , partner interview , and/or technical interview . Make sure to do your research in advance . You do n't want to make it all the way through to the final round and feel unprepared . <p> From the moment you try to find a job in London , you should make sure you are ready for the interview . You never know when you could get called in .

The scammers will normally try to get you to hand over a large amount of money ( normally the deposit and first month 's rent ) before disappearing and leaving you with a property that may not even exist . <p> If you are feeling nervous or worried that you might fall victim to a scam " fear not ! There is some excellent advice online and I have chosen my top 5 tips to help you avoid rental scams. <h> #1 Never pay in cash <p> www.thisismoney.co.uk <p> Scammers will want to be paid in a way that can not be traced " cash . Be very careful if a landlord insists that is how he/she wants to be paid . Also , be wary of those who ask for the money to be transferred via Western Union or another money transfer service. - Sometimes a scammer will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit and first month 's rent ) to be transferred to your friend/relative 's bank account so they can see that you can afford the property . They will then ask for proof of receipt and use this information to withdraw the money themselves . <p> Make sure you get a receipt every time you pay out money . In the unfortunate event that you become the victim of a rental scam , the evidence you have will help you win the case . <h> #2 Always view the property <p> **29;478;TOOLONG <p> One of the biggest rental scams is landlords taking money from prospective tenants without them even seeing the property . This is especially one to watch out for if you are looking for a place to rent before you have moved to London . There are a load of excuses as to why you might not be able to see the property including : <p> The landlord lives overseas and does n't have anyone available to show you the property . They will often suggest that you pay the deposit and then the landlord will send you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance work . They may even go to the trouble of giving you the address of a property that really is being refurbished . This will make their lies seem genuine . <p> The current tenants wo n't allow viewings as they work from home , work shifts ( so sleep during the day ) , or have people staying . <p> If you are looking from outside of London then one way to avoid this rental scam is to get your new employer/university or a friend to check the property out first and make sure that it actually exists ! <h> #3 Be realistic " is the price too good to be true ? <p> If the price seems too good to be true then it probably is . Scammers will offer a really cheap price in order to get as many people interested as possible . Have a look at similar properties in the same area and see how much they are currently being rented out for " if the price is more than 10-15% cheaper then there is a chance that the property does n't exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you can pay more extra rent per month instead of paying a deposit . At the end of the tenancy , they will give you this money back if there is no damage or breakages . This is a very tempting offer as the amount needed for a deposit can be huge ! Unfortunately , this is a rental scam and it is unlikely that you will receive this money back . The only way to keep your deposit safe is if your landlord places it into a Tenancy Deposit Protection Scheme ( TDP ) . <p> If you would like some more advice about deposits and dealing with landlords then take a look at our post here . <h> #4 Take photos of everything when you move in <p> Pic via Gumtree <p> Some landlords will try everything they can to keep your deposit and make a bit of extra cash at the end of your tenancy . Make sure to do your own inventory check and document/take photos of any damage to things like appliances , carpets , and furniture . <p> Keeping evidence is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is things like sewage leaking , the boiler breaking or if the walls start crumbling . Take photos or videos of everything , write detailed notes and keep a copy of all of the communication between you and the landlord . If the problem does not get solved and you need to go to court , you will win if you have evidence you did nothing wrong . <h> #5 Do your research and choose a trustworthy landlord <p> Pic from pixabay.com <p> A quick Google search will provide you with a lot of information and reviews ; you could also try and speak to previous or current tenants . Make sure you meet the landlord in person and that you have plenty of contact details for him/her . Scammers will often only have a mobile number and use a free email account like Gmail , Yahoo or Hotmail . <p> Letting agencies offer much more protection than private landlords as they are aware of scams and would have already checked the property is real and who the actual owner is . Make sure that the letting agency has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Residential Letting Agents ( ARLA ) . You can check that they are genuine by searching on the ARLA website . <p> Some scammers will break into empty properties and try and rent them out as their own . When the real owners turn up , the tenants are evicted as they have no rights to the property . If you are worried that this might be the case you can have a look on the Land Registry website ( this does cost a small fee ) . <p> I hope I have n't put you off renting a property in London . Remember , not all landlords are scammers and you may find a really cool place to live . Have a read of our post for some great tips for renting a room in London .

There are certain parts of London I would fear to walk through , in my high street shop type get up , but with an antique button ring or a natty scarf I can pass through the streets with a knowing nod to my fellow savvy shoppers because we know we are wearing something unique . <p> Vintage clothing is not just purchased ; it is experienced !

With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the musty , second hand shops I used to frequent . So I stumbled on something different " the pop up vintage fair . Here are my top tips for pop up vintage clothing shopping : <h> #1 Vintage clothing shopping " then TAKE CASH <p> Make sure you carry cash on you or at least know where the nearest cash point is . These are independent sellers who for the most part , will not be able to afford a card machine . <h> #2 Vintage dresses in volumes costs " so HAVE A BUDGET <p> Having physical cash in your pocket rather than your credit card can really help you stick to your budget as well . If you do n't have the money , you ca n't spend it . <h> #3 DO N'T BE AFRAID TO HAGGLE even for your vintage wedding dress <p> Haggling is not part of our culture but it is great fun and there is no harm in asking " the worst case scenario the seller says no but best case , you get an even better bargain ! Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash and remember , if it 's pre-owned it 's pre-loved so expect a little wear and tear . <p> Vintage armchair <h> #4 HAVE A SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE <p> Finding the best places to shop is heavily focused online . Facebook , Twitter and Instagram are great ways to join groups , follow people and look uphashtags like #vintage #vintagefairs #london etc . Word does spread and the best part is that it is live " I have updated my Facebook page with photos and comments while at an event which has brought other people along on the day so get involved ! <h> #5 TAKE YOUR TIMEIT 'S NOT JUST CLOTHES ! <p> I have bought original art work , organic oils , vinyl AND vintage furniture at vintage fairs . These events will usually have everything : from crafts to cupcakes . A retro home-phone could be next to a Georgian tea set , so make time to really explore and enjoy the whole place . Soak up the atmosphere , chat with the sellers and treat yourself to a slice of cake !

In the winter , attractions are cheap or even free and everything is generally less busy , however you must be prepared for EXTREMELY cold temperatures . When we visited in January , the daily temperatures dropped as low as -9-C and in the night , as cold as -15-Cbrrr ! <p> Memorial in Budapests old town . <h> Flights to Budapest <p> Travelling to Budapest is incredibly easy with flights from most London airports on a daily basis .

When we traveled to Budapest , we booked onto easyJet via Skyscanner , travelling out of Gatwick on a Tuesday and back on a Friday .

Although it 's not an absolutely crucial element of your CV , it 's one where you can highlight your advantages and gain an edge over your fellow job applicants . Even if you 're a highly qualified individual it can be difficult to think about and list one 's own skills . Many people simply use their skills day-to-day and think nothing of them , they may come naturally to the individual or they may believe that many people could carry out the same task in the same way . However , this is not the case , and if you are one of these people you need to take a deep look within and realise that you may have more skills to offer an employer than you realise . It 's with this in mind that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any employer would want to see on the CV of a job applicant . The skills we feature here are purposefully generic and can be applied to many different job roles . If you 're stuck on what to include in the Skills part of your CV , then you really need to take a look at these : <h> #1 Ability to Learn New Skills <p> Ability to learn new skills <p> Seems an obvious one does n't it ? But many people are averse to change and find taking on new tasks and new ways of working difficult . It 's a big advantage to an employer to know that an applicant is keen to learn new processes and can do so quickly and capably . In the employer 's mind seeing this written on a CV illustrates that you could fit within their organisation seamlessly . It also shows that you can adapt to new tasks which could be extremely useful to your employers . You could back up this skill by mentioning something in your job history that proves you have learnt a new process or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service Skills <p> No matter what industry you work within there is normally some form of customer service required- whether it 's dealing with a trade company , a colleague in a production line or an end consumer in a retail shop . Due to its widespread need Customer Service Skills are a great addition to any skills list . They show that you have the ability to deal with people in a courteous and professional manner whilst representing your company . If you can deal with work-place issues and keep your customer happy at the same time it 's a very valuable skill to have in your arsenal . <h> #3 Computer Skills <p> Computer Skills <p> Now depending on your chosen field of work this entry could detail the inner workings of Javascript or it could simply mean being proficient in the Microsoft Office Suite . Many jobs within the UK require some knowledge of computer programmes or operations , so if you are particularly well versed in software your employer uses , you should certainly include it within your CV . An employer will see this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on the software in question . <h> #4 Ability to Use Your Initiative <p> Ability to Use Your Initiative <p> This is an important skill especially if you plan to work in a dynamic environment , where the work day could cover several different sectors and you may not have a manager or supervisor around ( or perhaps you are the manager ! ) when a decision needs to be made . Taking your own initiative proves you have the confidence in your own ability and decision making to act without instruction , this ability may be very important in certain job roles . If the job you 're applying for requires a certain level of independent thought and decisions made quickly based on the information you have , then this skill could be a great one to feature on your CV . <h> #5 Ability to Work Under Pressure <p> Ability to Work Under Pressure <p> The ability to work under pressure is certainly a skill in the truest form . Not everyone can perform tasks under scrutiny or to a very tight deadline- it requires a cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do , and working in a pressurised environment is actually where you thrive , then you should certainly consider listing this quality on your CV . Finding out that an employee struggles with the demands of a pressurised job after hiring them is a major problem for many employers . If you demonstrate on your CV that you can work well in this type of environment it will certainly make your application stand out . <p> Tip : When including a skill on your CV try to think about areas of your career or life experience where you 've demonstrated that skill . Try to integrate these examples into your CV , where relevant , as this gives a prospective employer a real life idea of how you put your skills to use .

Festivals are so engrained in the UK 's summer ethos , an entire industry dedicated to them has developed with full teams slaving away from October of yesteryear booking acts , renting stages and setting exorbitant ticket prices . <p> Not to take anything away from London 's current paid festival calendar . There are many world-class events with epic names on the bill , spanning numerous music genres that feature . But , when a good two-thirds of your salary is dedicated to maintaining residence in the city that hosts these events , its good to know that London 's broke masses still have options when it comes to getting your festival on .

The festivals are open to everyone , placing an emphasis on families and community and celebrating many aspects of South Asian culture . <p> One of London 's largest events takes place in the borough of Ealing in the small community of Southall . The festival started last year and is slightly smaller than its counterpart the ZEE London Mela , but is completely ingrained in the community from which it originated .

@@80309312 @1809312/ <h> 5 Tips for Finding the Perfect Flatmate <h> Find the right- flatmate and avoid conflicts <p> Costly rentals , hefty mortgage payments and the rising expenses on monthly bills are convincing more and more people to let their rooms in flatshares and find flatmates to foot the bill . Searching for a compatible roommate or flatmate can be tiring and conflict-prone at times- but having said that , a little bit of pondering and careful planning in advance could go a long way towards avoiding potentially unpleasant situations with your future roommates . The best way to avoid disputes arising out of sharing a room or flat is to carefully screen and pick the right flatmate at the very beginning . Here are some simple golden rules which you should follow while searching for new roommates : <h> #1 Jot down a list of qualities you are looking for in your future flatmate <p> Prepare a detailed list of qualities you are looking for in your potential flatmate . The list should include lifestyle habits , profession , hygiene standards , shared hobbies and fields of interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #2 Meet and discuss <p> To protect your privacy , after screening a few flatmates and selecting the ones best matching to your requirements , meet them at a coffee shop or some avenue outside of the flat where you can have a detailed discussion . Cross-verify the quality list you have prepared , and assess your compatibilities as matching roommates . An open discussion will make things clear and help you in making the correct decision , so while being polite , still be open and not shy about your questions . <h> #3 Be clear about the costs you are going to share <p> Money is often the main source of discord between flatmates . Communicate clearly what costs you are going to share for the upkeep of the flat and ascertain your prospective flat-sharing candidate has the financial resources to fulfil all commitments . Mutual agreement regarding rental and other costs is a must before taking the final decision . It pays to have a written document so you 're both clear on your responsibilities and can reference it in the future just in case a dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background check <p> Ask for references from the one you think might suit your requirement , and then try to do a thorough background check to ascertain what they have communicated to you is correct . These days , a quick search on their social networks has a high probability of giving you much of the info you need . <h> #5 Stay together for a few days before taking the final decision <p> If possible , hang out together for a few days before finally moving in . This is perhaps the most important part of the whole selection process , as by spending a few days together , you can see for yourself whether your first impression about the person was right or wrong and both parties will also benefit from a better position to identify if your lifestyle traits are matching or not before you move in together .

Here is my top 50 tips for travelling on a budget : <h> #1 Research your trip before you go <h> #2- Avoid travelling in peak season <p> If you can help it , it is better to travel outside of peak season ( normally the summer months ) . Not only are the prices cheaper but the tourist attractions are less crowded and the accommodation will not be booked up . <h> #3- Do n't take too much luggage with you <p> More and more airlines ( especially low cost ones like Ryanair and easyJet ) charge you for checking in luggage . If it is possible , try to fly with hand luggage only . <p> Pic by sulondon-blog.syr.edu <h> #4- Do n't buy your currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a really bad idea " you will definitely get a bad rate . It always plays to plan ahead and take some with you and then exchange more when you arrive . <h> #5- Avoid withdrawing cash from an ATM <p> You are likely to receive a poor exchange rate from your bank and then have to pay a fee for withdrawing the cash on top of this . If you do have to use an ATM then make sure to withdraw large amounts at a time rather than lots of small withdrawals . <h> #6- Hunt out long lost friends and family <p> Travelling is a great excuse to hunt out friends and family that live in other countries . Whether they can offer free accommodation , a home cooked meal or just some insider knowledge ; this is a great way to save some money . <h> #7- Save money by staying in a hostel <p> Most hostels are not the horror stories that they used to be all over Europe ( and the world ) there are nice and clean , family friendly hostels . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out this list from The Budget Traveller . <p> Stay at a hostel <h> #8- Buddy up if you 're travelling alone <p> Not only will you enjoy the company but you will save money . A double/twin room is generally not much more expensive than a single , you will save money if you decide to take a taxi , cook for yourself or have a picnic and you share the cost of things like guidebooks , toiletries and travel adaptors . <h> #9- If you think you 're entitled to a discount " ask for it <p> Students , seniors , families and groups can all get discounts in most countries for most attractions . Whether it is a percentage off or a fixed rate ; it always pays to check . <h> #10- Use a guidebook <p> In the days of free Wi-Fi , mobile internet and travel blogs many think guide books are a thing of the past . I tend to disagree though " sometimes the internet is a bit overwhelming ! I was given Lonely Planet 's Europe on a Shoestring guidebook before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it every time I travel . <h> #11- Use your feet " walk as much as you can <p> Most of the big cities are not as spread out as you think they are . Before spending money on public transport , work out the actual distances between where you are staying and the things that you want to see . With a good pair of walking shoes , you might cut down your transport costs . <h> #12- Use a travelcard if you are taking public transport <p> Instead of spending lots of money on single journeys , see what other options there are . Cities like Berlin have day tickets for individuals and groups of 5 . In Paris it is cheaper to buy a book of 10 tickets at once than 10 single tickets and in London you should always get an Oyster Card . <h> #13- Explore the sights by going on a free walking tour <p> Every time I go to a new city I find out if there is a free walking tour that I can go on . So far I have walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other cities too . Sandemans New Europe offers free walking tours in 18 cities across Europe , the Middle East and the United States . <p> Pic by neweuropetours.eu <h> #14- When in Rome . <p> No matter which city you are in , the locals are the best people to follow . If you want to see a football match , see one of the local games for a fraction of the price . Talk to the locals ( or the staff where you are staying ) about the places where they go " they 'll let you know where the best happy hours are and what local events are worth going to . <h> #15- Get a museum pass <p> If you are planning on spending a lot of your trip visiting museums then have a look what offers are available . In Paris you can buy the Paris Pass- that allows you entrance in to all of the museums ( including the Louvre , Musee d'Orsay and the Arc de Triomphe ) without queueing. <h> #16- Bring a packed lunch or make a picnic stop <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit and a treat from the supermarket cost a lot less than eating out every lunch time . A packed lunch can also help you pass the time when you are on a train or lining up for tourist attractions . Whenever I go on holiday , I aim to take a packed lunch each day so I can enjoy a restaurant dinner . <p> Pic by realfood.tesco.com <h> #17- Take advantage of fixed price ( or set ) menu offers <p> Lots of restaurants around the world offer set menus where you pay a certain amount for either 2 or 3 courses . You normally only have a couple of menu choices and you will need to eat between certain hours but sticking to these can be a great way of eating at some of the best restaurants . In London , look out for pre-theatre menus , whilst in Paris you will see them list as prix fixe ' menus . <h> #18- Eat where the locals eat <p> Avoid going to the places with bright , colourful English menus , or ones with pictures of the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the best food I have eaten on holiday comes from tiny little places resembling somebody 's dining room rather than a restaurant . <h> #19- Eat at a local 's house with EatWith <p> If you want real quality food at a set price in a genuine environment then sign up with EatWith . The whole concept started as a way for tourists to avoid the usual tourist trap restaurants and dine in people 's houses . Simply look at the experiences available , book it online and then enjoy your night ! <h> #20- Drink at the bar <p> It may sound like a strange concept but in some cities a drink is cheaper depending on where you are when you drink it . In Rome , it is cheaper to have your espresso standing at the counter . Whilst in Paris , it is cheaper to drink at the bar rather than sitting at a table and more expensive again if you 're going to sit outside on the patio . <p> Pic by nineteenthirtyfour.org <h> #21- Do n't tip too much and look out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all countries will expect to tip and the amount will differ depending on whether you are in a hotel , restaurant or taking a taxi . Some countries ( like the United Kingdom ) will automatically add an optional service charge to the bottom of your bill .

If you need the internet , take advantage of free Wi-Fi in restaurants , cafes and other public spaces . <h> #23- Keep in touch by using an international phone card <p> These are sold at newsstands and off-licenses all over the world and off a much cheaper calling rate than what your phone provider or a payphone would .

Whilst this can be the long way round , you can save a lot of money " you may even get to leave the airport and experience another city on your way . <h> #31 Sign up for a Frequent Flyer program <p> Even if you only make a few journeys the points add up quickly .

However , - some time ago- I found out that I could buy a pretty decent brand new projector for less than -400 ! - My girlfriend and I tend to watch- a movie , TV series or documentary almost every night , a routine that both of us thoroughly enjoy . However , we normally watch these through our tiny 15 ' laptops making the whole affair very unexciting . Then we thought instead of buying gifts for one another , we could buy something together that we would both- benefit from ! - So , we agreed it would make sense to buy a home projector . <p> I admit that when it comes to home projectors I am a total newbie , and this post is not from an expert at all . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies on and its super . However , when I asked him about the price I found out that he spent around -600 ( almost double my budget ) . So , I had to do my own research to find one that would be suitable for our budget , and so decided to write about my experience as a first time buyer . So , think about this post as an introductory guide to buying a budget projector rather than a professional guide . Below I have mentioned some important steps you may need to consider before clicking that buy now button . <h> Set your budget <p> Ok , so your budget is the most important factor . On the one hand , if you have -600--700 to spend on a projector then this post is not for you , as were focusing on almost half this budget . On the other hand , if you type cheap projectors into Google or Amazon , you will find several options for less than -200 . As you can see through projectorcentrals article on cheap projectors , you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BenQ , Epson , Optoma , and others , than you can from these products. That 's why we decided to set the budget around -250--400 and go for a good quality , inexpensive projector from an established brand . <p> BENQ MX505 Projector available on Amazon <h> 5 Things you should consider before buying <p> 1 . The Native Resolution ( the higher the better ) 2 . The Brightness ( ANSI Lumens ) ( the brighter the projector , the higher the ANSI lumen rating ) 3 . The Contrast Ratio ( the higher the contrast ratio the more vibrant and eye-catching the colors. ) 4 . The possible connections Most of the projectors will have a basic VGA connector . However if your laptop offers a digital HDMI output then it would be wiser to get a projector with an HDMI connection as this will help you have the best image possible . 5 . Your actual Space If you have a small room/space you should try to buy a short throw projector which allows you to create big pictures in tight spaces . <p> **Moreover be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the projectors will have an approximately 5000 hours lifetime . <h> The top 5 budget projectors <p> Amazon has a page with the most Top Rated Projectors which you may find useful . And remember .. the more the number of the reviews and the higher the rating equal the best the model . Through several websites and reviews I ended up narrowing down my research to 5 budget projectors under -400 . I ended up buying the ViewSonic PJD5555W Projector which had 4.6/5 stars out of 792- reviews in total on Amazon.com . Not bad , right ? I have to admit that we both feel like we took the best choice ever . We are super excited with our Viewsonic and we have n't regretted buying it since. - The quality of the picture suburb , 2 times better than my friends BenQ that costs double my budget . <p> Anyway , below I have mentioned all of my different options from 5 different manufacturers . <h> #5 INFOCUS IN114x DLP Projektor -348 &amp; FREE Delivery in the UK <p> So , these are the best 5 budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find a comparison of these 5 models ( I could n't find the Optoma DX325 so I used instead the DX326 which has similar specs ) through Projectorcentral . Obviously , there will be other- good models out there at that price range . However , as I said this is my personal top 5 list and I am not an expert on projectors . In any case , all of the above-mentioned models seem to be really good for their price , so its your call ! Have a look through Amazon- or- eBay- ( both links will direct you to budget projectors under -400 ) . If you have other suggestions please mention them in the comment section below and if you buy one of the top 5 , do n't  forget to let us know how it is ! <h> Where to look for a budget projector <p> You can- have a look on basic websites like Amazon- and- eBay . That 's how we started our buying journey . Every time I found an interesting model I would search through shopbot ( I personally use idealo.co.uk ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market would be to buy the exact model . Most of the time , Amazon and eBay were top of the list . <h> Websites to compare projectors <p> After spending a bit of time trying to find affordable projectors I realised that the 2 best websites for comparing projectors and their specifications- were projectorcentral and pcmag . Try to check out reviews for the model that you like and be sure to read the negative ones in order to know the potential downfalls of your preferred model . <p> Budget Projectors compared at Projectorcentral <p> There is a really nice article-guide for buying a projector from pcmag which explains the things you should know before buying a projector as well as the parts that you should pay attention to . After reading this guide and spending some hours looking for blog posts and reviews on budget projectors , I concluded that I would rather go for a BenQ , an Optoma or an Infocus . However , I soon realised that most of the projectors in that price range are data or business projectors , which means that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their resolutions tended to be around- 800 x 600 pixels , which is good for images but not that good for video . For video , a good option would be to go for a 1080p , which is the current high end for high definition for projectors . So , I thought again about it and I tried to find a projector that was good for projecting movies instead of just slides and static images .

With families or jobs to work around , and without the money to spend thousands of pounds on a course , it can seem like an unobtainable dream for those who just do n't have the money to afford it . <p> But where ten years ago those without the cash to afford a degree-level education simply could n't have it , now , with the rise of the internet and the ever-increasing numbers of MOOC's- Massive Open Online Courses there are possibilities and ways for those without the money or the time to get the education they deserve . These MOOCs aim to give free education to anyone who wants it , helping those in need to get the skills and knowledge to help them get ahead in life . Here are five of the best ways to get cheap or free university education , even if you are broke in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Programs <p> For those looking for the full university experience- with a real degree at the end of it- the bad news is that even online , it 's still going to cost you . The good news is that these courses , set up by real universities or volunteer-funded not-for-profit organisations , give full access to the sort of courses that students in traditional universities would have : years of lectures taught by leading professors , which result in a degree accepted by almost all employers in the world- all a lot cheaper online . <h> The Open University <p> For those who simply do n't have the time to go to a traditional university , The Open University is the first name they 'll find- while it can be expensive at -2632 a year over 6 years , this is a much reduced cost over most unis , without the need for a student room , textbooks or travel expenses .

The University of the People is one of the largest of these- a volunteer-funded online university without any tuition fees , this does require students to be qualified at least to high-school level : beyond that , all that 's needed is $4000 for a bachelor degree ( roughly -2,400 ) . <p> While this can be a lot of money for those hard-up , this is a tiny fraction of the normal university cost- believe me- and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fit your study around a regular job to make ends meet . Right now the university only has two full subjects , Business Administration or Computer Sciences , but these are set to expand in the coming months- and being accredited , a degree from the University of the People can count for a lot in the hunt for employment . <p> University of the People- a place where anyone can learn- pic source : the positiveapproach.info <h> #2 Free University Courses <p> MOOCs- they mean much more than just the acronym- pic source : postgraduate.my <h> Coursera <p> For those not willing to spend any cash , there are a lot of other courses out there which can give you free university courses , whenever you want to learn . One of the biggest sites out there for free content is Coursera : with over 400 courses , it has partnered with the top universities in the world to give free education to anyone , anywhere . From education to computer sciences , there 's something just right for you . While unverified certificates are available to everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fee . While these courses can be taken whenever you have the time , it is recommended that you put in the hours with the site- with under 10% of students finishing courses , it can be hard to commit fully to getting that certificate . <h> edX <p> Another free online course site is edX founded by Harvard and MIT , it offers professional science and technology courses for free . With some courses taking dozens of hours to complete , it has the same problems as Coursera- and verified certificates once again come at a price . Nevertheless , for those looking for free education online , they do n't come with better credentials than edX . <p> edX.org- endless courses for those looking to learn . <h> Udemy <p> Finally , for a wider range of quick , easy-to-learn courses , Udemy.com has over 18,000 courses on everything from the works of T.S . Eliot to how to build a flappy birds ' clone . While most of these courses are free , the more professional/useful courses can cost up to -300 , which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Registration is free , and there are enough courses that almost any topic can be found and learned about- so the education you want is never far away .

The most useful source for these is the British Council their Work , Study , Create scheme gathers up all their scholarships and opportunities into one place , so there 's something for almost anyone ! <h> IAESTE Schemes <p> The IAESTE scheme allows second or third year science , applied arts and engineering students to travel abroad for 6-52 weeks , in any one of 80+ countries . The scheme allows you to travel to a different country to live , work and gain experience : while students must pay for their flight , visa , and vaccinations , they will earn a salary once there which can cover accommodation and living costs- all while working in a new environment and gaining great skills to help later in life . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there , there 's a chance for you too- if you have received recognition for your work and have interest from an overseas partner or host , there is the opportunity to enrol on the Artists International Development Program and get help networking with other artists and organisations overseas .

But what many do n't think about is the fact that in most London housing , pets are forbidden and even if they were n't , the amount of traffic and confusion can often be dangerous for any pets you keep . While many animals can be found in London zoos , these can be hugely expensive , and a bit of a let-down .

Completely free , though there is a suggested -3 donation , the Surrey Docks farm is a great place to get the farm experience , without even leaving the city . <p> A location for the families on a budget , Battersea Park Children 's Zoo is one of the more expensive places on this list , but nowhere near the prices of most of London zoos , where tickets can average about -20 per person .

Open all year round , tickets are -8.75 for an adult , and only -6.50 for children under 15- over a third of the price for any of the other big London zoos. <h> #3 Kensington Roof Gardens Free Entry Kensington <p> This is a little-known one- up on the roof of an old department store in Kensington are three sprawling gardens , each beautifully designed to represent a different look from history , and all free to the public !

But for those just looking to see rare London zoo animals , there are few places better than here . <h> Take a Look ! <p> While it 's that simple to find places to see London zoo animals cheaply and conveniently , these are nowhere near the only spots to go to .

As second hand shopping becomes more digital , it is especially important to ensure that there is an element of quality . You must ensure that the item you are buying is still in good shape . One of the best ways to do this is to buy from a shop that guarantees a thorough inspection of the clothes . For example , you can find guaranteed designer second hand at rebelle , who also ensure that the brand you are purchasing is authentic and not a knockoff. <h> #2 Is it better to meet with the seller in person ? <p> If you are purchasing from an actual person through a platform such as Ebay , for example , it is a good idea to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can ensure you get exactly what was described to you .

You can look through reviews of websites or the specific seller to see if there are complaints , such as the seller does not send the item quickly , or the products do not appear in person as in the photos or description . These are red flags . Instead , look for sellers that customers have given mostly positive reviews . If you do have a positive experience with the seller , write a review yourself , as the second hand selling business relies a great deal on trust . <h> #4 Is there a return policy ? <p> Some second hand clothing websites will offer a return policy , some will not .

Limit the risk through utilizing a safe payment system such as PayPal and learn how to shop second hand safely . If you do meet in person to exchange the item , make sure you do n't bring large amounts of cash .

When moving to a city the size of London to study it is difficult to know where to start when considering where you will live . With all kinds of student accommodation available you need to know what to look for when considering your options . There 's a choice of university or private halls , shared facilities or en suite and whether you want to be cater or cook for yourself . Here are some things to think about when making the important decision of choosing your London student accommodation . <h> #1 Location <p> An obvious one but there is perhaps more to think about than you may first imagine . Not only do you want to be near to where your lectures will take place but other amenities may also be important to you . If you are self-catered you will want a handy supermarket ; if you are thinking of going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national railway station ; and if you drive you may want to look to the outskirts where there is more on street parking or a car park facility . <h> #2 Private or University <p> Many students when first going to university only consider the halls provided by their school . This is understandable as they are often cheaper and have academic facilities provided by the university . However , there are many plus points to private halls . With private halls there is a large range of prices , they can have more facilities and companies provide most of the facilities like security , support team and communal spaces . When considering London student accommodation it is helpful to remember you have plenty of options . <p> Student accommodation <h> #3 Security <p> Feeling secure in your new home will be very important to you . It is worth looking into the security systems of the halls you are considering moving into . Some will have 24-hour guards and others will have fob access systems . <h> #4 Kitchen <p> When going to university you may be cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this off for a year by going for catered halls . If you are planning on fending for yourself make sure the kitchen has all the facilities you need and ensure the cleaning provisions suit you . <h> #5 Common Rooms <p> The social aspect of university is more important to some than others . A lot of halls of residence do not have communal spaces for you to socialise with your new housemates . If this is important to you check how big the kitchen area is or whether there are common rooms in the building . It is much cheaper than going to the pub every time you want to spend some quality time with your new friends . <h> #6 Previous Residents <p> You can never be 100% certain that the halls you choose will be right for you .

@@80309489 @1809489/ <h> What Makes a Good CV ? <h> Tips on- writing a good CV <p> It 's a good question and one which we are going to set about answering as best we can in this article. - When thinking about creating your CV think of the oft used phrase Beauty is in the eye of the beholder ' " although it may sound like an odd thing to bear in mind , this phrase holds the key to writing a good CV . Unfortunately there is no Swiss-army knife CV formula that makes a CV irresistible to all employers , you have to take a more specific approach and constantly think about what the employer you are writing to ( the beholder ' in this case ) is looking for . To make a good CV , you are looking to create a document that emphasizes all the relevant points about your experience and credentials in relation to the job description . Achieve this and you give yourself the best possible chance of getting invited to an interview . So , practically , how do you create beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire you ? <p> Beauty is in the eye of the beholder <h> #1 Experience and Qualifications <p> As one of their first priorities , any prospective employer will be very keen to find out if you have any experience or qualifications relevant to the role you 're applying for . This is kind of one of the first tick boxes in an employer 's head " you need to think about how you can ensure your CV ticks this box comprehensively . You may be able to achieve this by listing a school , college or university qualification that they 've stated they 're looking for on the advert . Or you may have worked in a similar position in the past and you therefore have some great work experience that will hold you in good stead to meet the challenges of this new role . Think about the wording you use when listing your experience ; are there any words the employer uses in their job advert that match your experience ? Do they give a name to a specific qualification or procedure they 're looking for experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocabulary for this specific term . This will instantly mean you get a tick ' for this specific check box in the employer 's mind . If you have n't got any previous experience or qualifications that exactly match the job placement then why not look at what you have got and think about how any of that experience over-laps with the role for which you are applying . In the majority of cases you will have some previous experience or a qualification that can be useful and relevant to a role " be sure you bring the employer 's attention to this in your CV . <h> #2 Skills <p> When writing the skills section of your CV you once more need to be mindful of the job description you 're responding to . Many employers list specific skills or traits in their adverts as they know the type of person they need for the vacancy .

A genuine passion for the job role is a major plus point in the eyes of the employer as it shows to them that this position may be more than a pay-check for you . So if you have a genuine interest in the position you 're applying for , or an aspect of it , you should definitely be looking to demonstrate this . Use any sections of text , such as your Personal Statement and Career Objective , to talk about why you have taken a particular interest in this role and how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound keen , the employer will welcome someone who really wants to work in their organisation . <h> #4 Personality <p> Quite often we choose jobs that fit our personalities . It makes sense as we have to work for a large portion of the day " you do n't want to be doing that in a job where you ca n't be yourself now do you ? So , if elements of your personality match the job vacancy then be sure to detail this in your CV content . For example ; if you have great people skills and enjoy dealing with people and are applying for a customer care job then this is a massive plus for your job chances . <p> Over at Jobulo we have a simple to use step-by-step CV writing application that makes it easy to create a CV that 's relevant to the job position you 're applying for .

These do n't even have to cost anything- WordPress.com is one of the most widely recommended blog building and hosting sites , and it 's very easy and free .

However , before you apply for these great new job opportunities you 'll need a CV that really shows off your qualifications . Writing a CV as a graduate can be tough as many CV templates are heavily biased towards work or career experience . As a graduate it 's likely you wo n't have much experience in the world of work but that wo n't hold you back , as long as you bear in mind our key tips for writing a graduate CV . <h> #1 Including Your Grades <p> As a graduate your main selling point to a prospective new employer is your wonderful education ! Your CV should reflect this and you should certainly be listing your grades , qualifications and the institutions where you studied prominently within the Education Section of your CV . We normally advise that you list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case it might be your University degree . This way your latest ( and probably best ) qualification takes pride of place and catches the employer 's eye . There are many jobs that require you to have a degree in a certain field , by positioning your qualification at the top of your Education Section , you quickly demonstrate to the employer that you meet their criteria . You should also remember to include the qualifications you achieved at college or 6th form and at school . These all form a picture of you to the employer which helps them to match you to the job role . They are also a list of qualifications that you should be proud of and demonstrate what you have achieved so far . <p> Graduate CV Example <h> # 2 Mention Some Work Experience <p> Although you wo n't have much experience in the work-place , you 'll probably have some and it 's important that you include it on your CV . Did you take part in any work experience placements during the studying for your degree ? If they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for then it 's imperative you include that experience on your CV . Even if the placement was for a short period of time , it shows the employer that you have real world experience in this field . Do you have any examples of work , perhaps some course-work , completed via your studies , that would be relevant to the job you 're applying for ? Including a portfolio of work examples can be very beneficial in some industry sectors and is a great way to show an employer some samples of the work you can do . Additionally you should n't overlook any part time jobs you have had while you were studying . Part time entries are worth including , even if your- work has been in fields completely unrelated to the industry you 'd like to work in , as it 's useful for an employer to see that you are capable of meeting the demands of a paid work position . <h> #3 Make Use of References <p> References are important on any CV but can be pivotal to a graduate CV where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base their opinions on . The right reference can support your qualifications and give the employer that little nudge in the back towards hiring you . If you 've worked in an internship , or had a work experience placement within an industry relevant to the role you want to work in- you should consider contacting the previous company to request their permission to include them as a reference on your CV . A good reference from someone in the industry can really increase the strength of your graduate CV . If you have n't had a suitable work experience placement why not consider asking your college or university lecturer to serve as a reference on your CV ? Listing your lecturer as a CV reference illustrates great confidence in your own ability and gives the employer the opportunity to find out a little more about you , if they decide to call upon your reference . You can read further on picking the right references for your CV over at Jobulo . <p> - Tip : When choosing your CV design and layout be sure to select something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're applying to work in . Your CV design can have a big influence over what parts of your CV stand out " use this to your advantage !

Whether it 's selling unwanted clutter to clear some space , or trying to work from home and start your very own trading business , sites like eBay.co.uk and Amazon UK and learn selling skills too . While creating a multi-million pound business from online selling might be out of the reach of some , there are still a lot of fantastic tips that can help out anybody that wants to make a profit online , and get ahead of their competitors . <h> #1 Starting to Sell <p> Starting out selling online can be a scary prospect , with a lot to take into account- products , prices , competition , marketing , and much more . The absolute first thing to do is properly learn the rules these can be vitally important when selling anything , and prevent you from putting something up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can complain , and most importantly helping you never to do something that might get that successful account banned . <h> what to sell <p> The first thing for sellers to decide is what to sell : for those who just want a hobby which will give them some extra pocket money , anything lying about the house is a great start , as long as you do n't use it any more . If it 's gone unused for 6-12 months , however much you like it , it might be a good idea to put it on eBay , and convert those unused shoes into some extra cash . It should be noted on Amazon that only Pro Sellers can list certain items including popular ones , like clothes and shoes- so if you 're planning on selling 40 items a month or more or even if you 're currently only thinking about your first couple of listings- it might be good to register as pro , as you 'll save money as well as have a lot more freedom . <h> everything can be bought and sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sell you might be surprised . Broken phones and electronics will sell to people who can repair them , and things like bits of string , spare tyres or even a Dorito in the shape of the Pope 's hat have all been sold for a few pennies at some point . eBay allows 20 free listings a month , so it never hurts to start off with a few random items just to see what sells and what does n't . If you 've already used up your 20 , keep an eye out for eBay 's free listing weekends free listings on as much as you want ! <h> Way to start <p> One more for new sellers out there : almost everyone recommends selling books on Amazon to start with ; it 's how the site got started , after all , and it 's what many go there to buy- plus , second-hand books can be cheap to buy , and sell for a much higher price . <p> Everybody has to start somewhere- Amazon.co.uk <h> #2 Think Like a Buyer- Amazon and eBay Selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting out is to think like a buyer that means looking at what you 're selling and asking yourself : would I buy this ? I have never bought anything from a seller without a profile , with no good ratings or with items uploaded that had no photos or description , and I would n't expect anyone else to either . It does n't take a lot to upload a clear , useful image of the product , along with a description of what it is , and this will really help you shift what you 're trying to sell . Another great tip is to buy some things before you sell not only so that you get vital ideas about what sells well and what listings you 're most attracted to , but also so that you can start gaining some good feedback most people wo n't buy at all from a seller with zero feedback , even if the item is amazing , so this is a must . <h> Find your niche market- <p> Specialising can also help rack up sales- rather than having a clutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one niche that you can be known for is a great way to get return customers if people see you as one of the best places to go for an item , they 'll come back to you time and time again , and it also helps you look credible and professional to anybody browsing your profile . <h> Cut costs <p> Another good tip is to get to know where to cut costs when selling- margins are everything when looking to make a profit . Do n't just think of the obvious things either- for example , PayPal costs sellers 3.4% of the amount paid , as well as a flat 20p per transaction selling larger items , this can be costly . While all sellers have to include this option , it might be a good idea to politely suggest cheque or direct debit or , for those items that need to be collected , asking for cash up front . <h> Think like a scammer <p> Thinking like a buyer can also stop you from losing money- like it or not , scammers are a reality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your products without paying a penny . But a good way to prevent this is to think like they do if you were a scammer , what would you try ? Working out ways of conning sellers can be a great way to prepare for being conned yourself , and preventing it . Always use a trackable postage service , so you 'll know for sure if your item arrived or not ( eBay and Amazon wo n't side with you in a dispute unless you 've paid for tracking ) , and with eBay make sure that your buyer has a good track record , and not a terrible feedback score . Try and ensure that you track every step of the process- eBay 's Selling Manager Pro is fantastic for this , since it automates emails to the customer , letting them know when you 've received their payment , when the item is on its way , and more . This not only means scammers ca n't claim you 're scamming them , but also that you 're not as responsible if anything goes wrong- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> #3 Marketing Plans for eBay and Amazon <p> If you 're wanting more than to just sell a few odds and ends occasionally , and actually begin to grow your site and make a tidy sum , marketing- as in anything- is key to getting ahead . If you 've ever worked in marketing , used SEO or tried to get your portfolio outto the world , you 'll already have a lot of the skills you 'll need to make your items stand out from the crowd . Keywords are key finding out what people search for most can really help you pull in searches , so play around with Google Adwords to find out what the most popular searches are for your kind of items . Do n't label your item magenta dress by Vivenne Westwood ' when Vivienne Westwood red dress ' pulls in ten times the searches . In the same way , if you 're looking for things to sell , try to look for things that are currently high on the best-selling list or in deals , or product ranges that have good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mean you sell a lot more than your competitors . <p> Google Adwords- Give your items an edge with keywords <h> Learn how to sell yourself <p> Marketing is also about selling yourself , and this can be hugely important too- as stated before , it 's vital that you garner some positive feedback before you start selling , so people know that you 're trustworthy , and always take pride in your online business make sure that the things you send out wo n't be easily broken en route , and that they 're going to the right destination . A tip many recommend is to personalise each delivery include a little note , or a small free gift based on the price of the item that 's being shipped . This can make people remember you , and come back to shop again . Remember to reply to all customer communications within 24 hours if you do n't , it 'll count as a demerit against your account . <h> #4 Selling Professionally <p> If you 're looking to expand your business still further , and want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are some fantastic tips and tricks which can make you seem like a professional , and really give you an edge over others who do n't employ them . The free eBay Turbo Lister allows you to list dozens of items offline , then upload them in bulk to the site- meaning you save a huge amount of time and effort in managing your items , and can make your business look more professional and well-organised . <h> Learn when to end a bid <p> Another tip to get ahead of the competition in eBay is to learn when to end a bid sure , you can set a general time limit , but if this ends on a weekday morning or halfway through the night , not that many people will be fighting over it in those last few seconds . The very best time to end it is Sunday afternoon when eBay has the most customers online- but it might help to learn your target audience , figure when they 're online , and try to end it then for maximum impact . <h> Price competitively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an item and go for that- if your item sells well , sell it at the best price that qualifies for free shipping . If the item does n't seem to be selling that well , it 's good to undercut the best price out there by a tiny amount , so people will always go towards yours- as long as you 're not making a big loss doing it ! <h> Fulfillment by Amazon <p> FBA- these are vital letters if you 're wanting to sell professionally on Amazon . They stand for Fulfillment by Amazon ' , a service which allows you to send your items in bulk to Amazon , who will package , post and control all aspects of your business , as soon as products are sold . They even handle customer complaints and refunds for you . While this costs more than just a pro account , it 's definitely worth it if you 're starting out in business- there are n't many out there who do n't recommend it . <p> Every business needs help sometimes- Picture source : Wired.com <h> #5 Final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when someone has bought or placed a final on a product : there 's still lots left to do which can build up your profile and get you some repeat customers . Always dispatch an item within two days of the purchase , and remember to package well , leaving something for the customer to remember you by ; always use a tracking service , and make sure that payment is in before you send ( a final tip for PayPal : if eBay is still showing not paid ' , it 's best to check your PayPal account sometimes the money is just sitting there ) . On Amazon , remember to update your inventory daily after you 've sold- you do n't want people trying to buy items that have already gone ! <p> Selling on eBay and Amazon can be one of the most rewarding experiences ever- watching as your money piles up , you gain repeat customers and grow your profile can be fantastic . One of the best things about it , however , is that there are few risks in starting out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right tips and decisions , edge ahead of your competitors and do very well indeed .

But what about co-living ? With affordable inner-city space a little hard to come by these days , these cooperative set-ups are on the rise . <h> What is co-living ? <p> While there 's nothing new about shared housing ( many twenty-somethings live with housemates ) , co-living is a new approach to the idea . These communal spaces are usually made up of small bedroom units , with lots of shared areas inside the building .

Rent can eat up about two thirds of the pay packet of a Londoner " and accommodation is a big headache , even for those on relatively large salaries . <p> These cities also happen to have booming job markets that are drawing in more and more young professionals .

About 60% of 18-24 year olds admit to feeling lonely , despite living in house shares or lively central locations . In co-living spaces , wallet-friendly rental prices combine with plenty of community spirit to kill two birds with one stone .

@@80309566 @1809566/ <h> London Flat Hacks " How to Make the Most of Your Space <h> Tips and tricks to make your space feel a little bigger <p> Living in a tiny flat or just a room in London can bring a series of challenges . Where " for example " are people going to sit when they come over ? Two 's a crowd , so that third person better sit on the coffee table when tea is served . <p> Flats are notorious for their space issues . Though economical , it may seem that choosing for price means sacrificing some comforts and compromising on the few left to be had . <p> This article serves to tell you that there is hope out there for those of you who can walk from one end of your flat to the other in just a few seconds . By utilizing these five flat hacks and space-saving techniques , you can make the most of your space and turn your flat into a practical " yet comfortable " living area . <h> #1 Use Optical Illusions <p> You can trick your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look and feel of your flat , consider the optical illusions that are created when reflecting lights off a large mirror . The mirror makes the room look bigger , and the lights lend the space a bright and airy feel . Focus on getting as much natural light into the room as possible by pulling back curtains or ditching them altogether . <p> Besides , this way you wo n't even have to turn on the the tele to check out the news , you 'll just be able to look outside for your London forecast . And do n't fret about higher utility bills when you do this , if your walls have the proper insulation you 'll barely notice the difference . Hanging curtains at the top of the wall can also trick the eye and give the illusion of height . Use the same idea when putting together storage : Go vertical . <p> Open Window <h> #2 Bring in Bigger Furniture <p> Though this may seem the opposite of what you should do , bringing in larger furniture can actually give the room the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so carefully . Use large furniture for items such as a couch or your bed , which will give you plenty of space for relaxing and rejuvenating . <p> When you choose your accent furniture , make sure they 're not cramping the remaining area . It 's always a good idea to know your total area before shopping and to have moving help ready to go if you make a purchase . That couch is n't going to get itself up to your flat walking on its own two legs ( though that would be nice ) ! <h> #3 Divide the Space <p> Flats and studio apartments often have open floor plans . This can create an issue as you try to separate your living and sleeping quarters . To do this , divide the space into sections . Whether you do so with actual room dividers , area rugs or through the use of color , creating zones can be helpful in giving the perks of separate spaces . <p> If you choose to use a rug or table , the main benefit is that it keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealing . And let 's face it , room dividers do n't do much , and you 'd rather spend the money at the local pub with your mates . Or stop at the McD 's if you 're feeling peckish. <h> #4 Choose Multifunctional Pieces <p> Maximize space by choosing furniture pieces that have multiple functions . Drop-leaf tables can act as a side table , as well as a dining space . Open shelving can establish zones while holding your book collection . Stackable seats may be great for more seating , but they are also functional as coffee or end tables . <h> #5 Make Do With Less <p> This may be hard to hear , but doing with less means there 's less to do with . In other words , spend some time purging items in your flat that are n't functional and have no sentimental value to you . Do you really need that Doctor Who tea kettle ? Probably not . <p> Marie Kondo made a big wave in Western thinking by proposing that the stuff surrounding us should either bring joy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate the value of decluttering . It may help you out , too . <p> You may have a space that seems a bit small , maybe even humorously cramped . And unfortunately , unlike Mary Poppins bag , our room does n't magically grow to accommodate what we toss in there . Make the most of your flat by using these hacks to maximize your small space .

We have come up with a number of job hunting tips to help you get through this difficult task and come out the other side smiling . So sit back , relax and take in all these great tips . <h> #1 Taking care can make everything better <p> When completing an application form it is very important to take care with the process . This is because it could potentially be the difference between getting an interview and going on to the next stage , or an instant rejection . Completing applications online can make it even more risky , as you need to take care with your spelling and typing errors " an employer may pick up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you are consistent with your use of grammar as the person reading it may assume your writing skills are not as a good as you say they are . If the application is in written form , then we would recommend to plan what you want to include first . <p> When completing the form make sure you are consistent with your font and handwriting style as this may tell an employer you are inconsistent and possibly show you are unreliable as you 're quick to change . Important point , if your pen runs out , make sure you replace it with one of the same colour ! <p> Top Tip Alert : Check your application thoroughly before pressing that submit button " a second look may make all the difference . <h> #2 Honesty is the best policy <p> Now I know you may think it 's easy to lie on your application form but honesty really is the best policy .

Therefore , giving them as much detail as possible is important and can really help you when competing with others . So if the form leaves a space for you to write a personal statement or a section for you to tell them why you would like the job , then fill it up . Make sure the text is carefully written as you want to give a good impression . Do n't leave any gaps behind as you may give the employer the impression that you have something to hide ! <p> Top Tip Alert : Blank spaces may also suggest to the employer you are not as interested as you should be , therefore giving a black mark against you . So show them how much you want it ! <h> #4 Be prepared and have a copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a number of candidates applying for the same job and they will want to see who the best ones are . This means that they may quiz you on a specific point in your CV or application . Make sure you know what you have written and what is on there so you can be ready for any type of question . This will show them a variety of different skills like thinking on the spot , organisation and many more , without you have to write it down for them to see . So if it 's an online form , before submitting , copy and paste it into a word document so you can always reference back to it . <p> Top Tip Alert : On the day have a quick read over your copy before the interview , refreshing your memory and getting you ready for any questions they have for you . <h> #5 Extra spice makes all things nice <p> When applying for a job , sending your CV and an application form may be what they ask you to do , but why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd . Add a covering letter ! Take this opportunity to personalise your application and add any details that may not be mentioned in the form .

Single unit Landlords <p> The landlord could be anyone , from corporate landlords to single unit landlords and everything inbetween . But what 's most important is that you do the necessary research before you decide on your next room or flat . Corporate landlords tend to own very nice properties that are well-kept .

Document the state of appliances , carpets and surfaces throughout the flat in order to have evidence at the end of the lease to present to the landlord . This is essential , especially if you 've taken it in your own hands to clean and maintain the flat in its best condition before you move out . <h> Tenancy Deposit Protection Scheme ( TDP ) <p> It is also important to note that according to the Tenancy Deposit Protection Scheme ( TDP ) which was introduced by the government in 2007 , your landlord ( or agency ) is obliged to place your deposit for the flat with a government-backed scheme within 30 days of receiving it in order to protect your deposit during your rental period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days once a mutual agreement between you and the landlord is reached ( minus any amounts due to be deducted from the deposit ) .
