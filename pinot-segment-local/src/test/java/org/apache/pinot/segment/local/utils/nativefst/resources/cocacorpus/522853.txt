Basic sword swings and thrusts . <p> One of the shadows uses a homing fireball projectile that will curve around obstructions to hit you . Its best to dodge through these rather than to either side or backwards . <p> The second uses melee attacks along with a flamethrower style attack that has considerable range . Dodge to either side to avoid this . <p> The third uses basic melee attacks , but they come pretty quickly . As the fight progresses , these melee attack from both shadows gain the ability to stretch out like a snake and it gives them considerable extra range , so be wary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward fight . None of the shadows are particularly difficult , and the main obstacle will be just from the fact that there is 3 of them . Which one you tackle first is really up to you , but taking down the one launching the fireballs at you first will help you clear that problem early on , which may help to leave you more able to focus damage on the other 2 since you have less to worry about dodging . This also has implications during the final stage of the fight , as well , though . <p> Whenever you reduce one of the shadows to less than 33% health , they will sprout snakes coming out of their head/torso . These snakes themselves do n't do anything , but when this happens both of the melee shadows will gain the ability to have their melee attacks gain a whip-like effect , where certain slashes and thrusts will have significantly increased range . The only particularly new thing to be aware of here is that they gain an upward slash that will launch you into the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very quick and can catch you unaware easily . <p> If the 3 shadows have their health reduced to low enough ( if you are not trying to individually eliminate them ) , or if you kill 2 of the 3 shadows , the stage enters is final stage , where the remaining shadow(s) gain the ability to summon large snakes from the ground that will attempt to do lunging bite attack at you . They sprout at random locations in the arena , and they attack extremely fast . The more you keep distance between yourself and the remaining shadow(s) , the more frequently this attack is used , so it is best to keep the pressure on them and fight aggressively at this point . If you killed the fireball shadow first , this part is slightly more difficult because the melee shadows put up much more of a fight , obviously , but the fireball shadow tends to use the snake attack more frequently .

It primarily uses frontal attacks . Its attacks can poison , and cause buildup for poison . It has a grab animation that it will insta-kill lower level players who try to close in but do not react fast enough to the grab . <p> During the first " stage " , the BSB will mostly perform a charging attack which is dodged easily and has a long telegraphing animation . It is easy to avoid . Moving in close and provoking an attack is a good idea , as it is possible to parry this attack with your gun . Whenever it raises it 's right arm to attack , parry it . This allow you to perform a visceral , which usually takes about a sixth to an eighth of its health . <p> After the BSB has about 2/3 of it 's health remaining , it will release a shrill scream and begin using longer attack cycles with several more animations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing . If the BSB begins closing in and you are forced to face it directly forward , back step repeatedly to avoid getting hit . It 's front attack animation during this stage is a multitude of hits and it can easily kill you . Its poison buildup is much higher here as well . The BSB will still charge you , and can even perform a grabbing attack . However , it can still be parried and visceral attacked , and mastering this will make the fight significantly easier . <p> After the BSB has 1/3 of it 's health remaining , it will enter it 's final " stage " , with another shrill scream , and from this point on simply being within close proximity can poison you . The poison is relatively fast acting and can easily drain your health quickly enough to kill you , especially if you are n't paying attention to your health bar while dodging its attacks . One or two more parries and visceral attacks will win the fight . <p> Pillars <p> Another , longer tactic is to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Beast so that it can more easily dodged and managed before counterattacking . If you have n't yet mastered parries , this strategy may be easier for you , but be aware that it is much more likely that you will get hit trying to lure it around , especially considering that it can often attack through the pillars . If you want to win easily , and you want the rest of the game to be much less difficult , practicing parries on the regular enemies in the area and getting used to using them will open up much more possibilities for you . This fight is meant for mastering the use of your gun , so using this strategy will put you at a disadvantage for later areas . <p> Low Level Strategy <p> Before taking on the Blood-Starved Beast I recommend that you explore Hemwick Charnel Lane first ! <p> Recommended Weapon Level : +4 to +6 <p> Recommended Armor : Black Church Set <p> Recommended Runes : Lake ( +3% ) <p> Recommended Items : Antidote / Fire Paper <p> This can be a tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets even more so as he loses health .

Just keep your eye on his right arm and keep dodging under it before he attacks to survive this round . However , stay away from his blood-starved maw .

Throwing Knives are last resort for when you 're out of your other consumables , or to poison enemies/players at low levels . Lead Elixir essentially grant you poise at the cost of your movement speed . Although prefered on slow Strength weapons , very few builds and weapons can trade with Chikage 's attacks , but you as a phantom have lower hp than your opponent as well as a hp drain debuff , this allow you to not get staggered and deal damage with R1 's , R2 's and L2 's uninterrupted .

The game can be played and completed offline , although these unique online features can be used to help or create more challenge for a player . While maintaining the overall format of a single-player game , multiplayer activity is seamlessly integrated into the world . Players can choose to help others by assisting them through an area to defeat a boss , or they can choose to invade and attempt to kill other players in their world . Interactive tombstones will reveal the last moments of another player before they died , and players can also leave notes on the ground for others to see . <h> Tombstones <p> When a player interacts with tombstones , they may see the death of the player who left it .

To rate notes , the player can press the either the left side of the touch pad , fine rating , or the right side of the touch pad , bad rating , while reading the note . Notes can also be rated by viewing read messages within your Notebook .

Once players successfully defeat the boss enemy in the area they are joined to , the guests receive a bonus reward and are returned to their own game . If the guest(s) die , or leave using the Silencing Blank , the guest(s) are returned to their world and no reward is received .

To perform this mechanic , press R1 while an enemy is staggered . Must be done while facing the enemies front or back . To stagger an enemy , press L2 while an enemy is attacking , or perform a charge attack while facing an enemies ' back . Once staggered , an enemy will fall to one knee and be open to a Visceral Attack , which causes high damage and throws the enemy backwards .

However , his largest weakness is that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to push him or manipulate him into falling off the tower . <p> When approaching his rooftop perch in Old Yharnam , Djura will attack you with a constant volley from his mounted Gatling Gun , which while easy to dodge , can lead to an untimely death if you allow yourself to be distracted by the enemies in the area . <p> Once confronted Djura will switch to a Stake Driver and Hunter Blunderbuss while tossing the occasional Firebomb at you . Djura is an incredibly aggressive and quick opponent opponent giving players very little time to heal or counter his attacks and will do a quick dash attack , which has a very brief charge time , an explosion attack from his Stake Drive or repeatedly fire his Blunderbuss at players who attempt to gain distance or heal . Healing will often lead to Djura using his dash attack . <p> Simply mashing R1 or a poorly timed Gun shot will cause Djura to respond with a Gunshot of his own stunning the player and giving Djura a riposte opportunity which will very likely lead to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may also be parried , though difficult , and while untested the very brief charge window before his dash attack may be the best opportunity for a successful Gun shot parry . <p> Do not underestimate this fight , Djura is comparable to a skilled human invader in terms of difficulty and the small combat area does little to help the situation . <p> SL4 strategy ; probably works above that level too . Do n't pause on the ladder and he should still be at the edge of his platform ; as soon as you can , shoot him twice with the pistol . Gravity will do the rest . <h> Notes <p> If Djura falls off the edge and dies his loot may become stuck in mid-air unable to obtain . Quitting out of the game and reloading will spawn it at his starting location on top of the roof .

This terrible attack is easy to avoid and leaves her weakpoint vulnerable for a moment , if you advance quickly . <p> If she rears up before the headbutt , it means she 's going to launch forward a bit .

As long as you do n't stay right under her head , you 'll get a few free hits on her weak point ; her head . After her head has been attacked enough , easiest during her headbutts or with any overhead chop attacks , such as the Saw Cleaver 's long R1 , she 'll become stunned for a Visceral Attack . If she floats to either side , just watch out for her next attack , but if she flies back , dodge wildly to one side , to avoid her highly damaging charge . Her blood spray can cause major problems , as it takes massive health with no chance for Rally , and her lasers , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Try to stay close to her so that she does n't perform any ranged attacks , and try to dodge through her arm swipes , as she will combo one swipe from either side , and then a headbutt , which is her best attack for the player . <h> Strategy 2 ( Endurance Battle ) <p> Apart from all the above , I found my own way to kill her . It probably takes the longest , but it 's the most safe of tactics . Step oneDo n't lock on to her . What you wan na do is stay a medium range away from her ( just out of reach of her tentacles ) and circle her . At this range , you 'll be at a range where a charged R2 from , let 's say , Ludwig 's Holy Blade in its transformed form ( the great-sword ) , will always hit her when she head-slams .. unless you ran a bit too far from her . <p> Soft-mention : it 's not worth attacking her when she head-slams with her tentacles cause it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tentacles , or even head , without possibly retaining damage with getting in , then getting out . It 's because she recharges herself fast when she does her head+tentacle slam . I often can only get a single R1 in cause I stay relatively far in order not to die ( if you get hit with the tentacle+head-slam , it will either damage you for all your hp if all hits connect or outright kill you ) . For this phase of the fight , up until likethe 40-50% hp mark , I did n't use any vials . Besides maybe 1-3 . <p> You basically wan na circle around her constantly ( not locked on , as I said ) , and when she charges , that 's when you have to dodge/roll in the direction you 're running . I ran left , so I 'd often dodge left or else fear getting half my hp rammed . When she head-slams ( she has good differentiated indicators for when she charges or head-slams ) , that 's when you start to walk forwardbut not too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your weapon 's range , especially for something like the transformed Ludwig 's , which is pretty long on its own . If your weapon is atLet 's say+6 , like mine was .. And if you have a decent 30 strength ( to also use the cannon ) , this fight should be breezy with this strategy . A charged R2 will often do 900-1k damage at 30 str and whatever dex . <p> Careful though . At under 50% hp , she gets more aggressive and gains some arcane moves after she ' buffs ' up ( this is a time to R2 him as well , by the way ) .. A meteor which she never used on me , and some mini-soul spears that you can dodge by literally just constantly running ( you do n't need to sprint ) . This part of the fight was when I used the most blood vials because I got a bit aggressive ( you get kind of bloodthirsty once she gets to 30% hp ) . Also , wear the Yharnam Hunter 's gear . It has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea rune for +200 Frenzy resistanceOr both . ) I believe the aura around him causes frenzy if you 're in it for too long . In any case , the aura also causes damage . So you do n't wan na be in it for too long nevertheless . I used about 12 blood vials total cause I knew I 'd kill her with this strategy . Just had to be patient , keep my hp high , and not over-commit stupidly . <p> You can also employ use of the cannon at 30 Str and 13 Skill . ( keep your bullets at max+5 via the Up-arrow on the DPAD ) . You do need to time it well as to not get hit by her as well as shooting her head . I only used the regular 2 cannon shots , but if you keep your bullets at +5 , you 'll be able to use more ( Cannon takes 10 shotsyou have 25 if you +5 yourself ( 20 normally ) , use cannon , then +5 yourself again .. rinse and repeatAlthough , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual bullet count . In any case , you 'll get at least 3 cannon shots to work witheach doing like 600 damage to its head ) . <h> Environment <h> Notes <p> Lift may stuck at bottom level and can not be call back , so it 's impossible to access boss anymore . Send lift back every time ( step on platform button and run away ) before enter boss area . ( Fixed with 1.03 patch ) <p> She 's not initially hostile . <p> Every time you come through the fog door , you can sneak up behind her a do a full charged attack and a follow-up . <p> The Clawmark Rune can be used after you stun Ebrietas however you may only get one or two visceral attacks in throughout the fight so a different Caryll Rune might be preferable .

While walking along this higher ledge , a Hunter Mob will attempt to ambush you to your right , so kill him and move forward . Approach the stairs on the left side of this ledge but do not head down them . You will hear a bell ring as you get close and some of the Hunter Mobs will dissipate and patrolling .

However you choose to approach this situation , be careful as these two can aggro quite easily together , making it a much tougher fight . <p> Keep going down the bridge and kill the Hunter Mob with a sickle tries to ambush you on your left . Head into the building he was in front of and kill the two Hunter Mobs who are waiting in the darkness . This is the same building as earlier , but the top floor , so you can reach this spot again by simply going up the stairs from the shortcut here .

His moveset is nearly to what you would have using those weapons , usually swings of his axe with a few rolling attacks . He can be easily parried as a human . If the Hunter moves to medium range , Gascoigne will use his pistol , often spamming it . This is mostly just annoying , as its damage is fairly low . It 's not until he transforms into a werewolf that he gets extremely dangerous , as his attacks become relentless , extremely fast , and highly damaging . <h> Drop <h> Notes <p> After you defeat the boss , a Lamp will appear which will allow you to warp to the Hunter 's Dream . 129103 @qwx989103 <p> Human form : <p> Pistol Shot <p> Non-transformed blade attacks <p> Transformed blade attack <p> Beast form : <p> Overhead Smash <p> 4-5 quick hit combo <p> Charge <p> 2-3 slower swipes 129105 @qwx989105 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will feel like fighting a copy of yourself . Just make sure you have a tombstone between you and him , and this should be a piece of cake . If you have bullets , he can also be parried an riposted fairly easily , which should take care of almost a quarter of his health per riposte . After taking some damage ( about a third of his health ) , he will transform the Hunter Axe , giving him reach . Worry not though , as the tombstone still blocks him and ripostes still work . Then comes the beast phase , in which he will become significantly faster and more vicious . Watch out for his insane combos and keep dodging until you have a moment to breathe . To facilitate all this process , the Tiny Music Box will allow you to stun him for some good R2 bashing . Additionally , having a few oil urns and molotovs can make quick work of this phase , as he already takes increased damage from fire due to his fur . Two or three cocktails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy kill . <p> Notes : <p> He is fast . Be on your heels . <p> Do not use the Music Box when you are either too far away from him or behind a grave . <p> Note that he is easy to parry in the first 1/2 of the fight . <p> The cheese-strategy only applies to the first 2/3rd of the fight . <p> Alternative Strategy : <p> Enter the boss room . Immediately use the ' Music Box ' after counting to 2 . If you do n't he will shoot you and you will lose precious opportunity . If you do n't have the Music Box you got ta time it right . Enter . Lock-on . Shoot him . Run . <p> Run to the right of the arena and run up the stairs . Up above , there are a many coffins and turn angles for you to hide behind and avoid his bullet fire ( lesser blood vial usage compared to grave-level ) . Also an escape route that gives you a solid 10 seconds to heal and run back up around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have been dodging all this while on flat empty plane , the graves here are there to throw off your dodges . Step 2 ensures you are where you can use what you have learnt so far . <p> Now while he is becoming Beast Gascoigne , there is enough time to lob 2 Molotov 's ( same as an oil urn+Molotov ) . If you are on the top floor , you will always be in-range for it to hit . This will hurt him bad . All beasts are weak to Fire . <p> In ' Beast ' mode he is faster . He will either go crazy and start hitting ( frenzy ) or jump high-up and do a plunging attack . Former ( crazy mode ) , just stay away and try and hit him with the gun for a easy parry ( dodge back ) . Latter ( jump mode ) , just dodge towards him , he will miss and you will get 3 exact R1 hits . <p> Cheese-strategy to kill Beast Gascoigne : make him to follow you upstairs , dodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He will try to attack you through the fence , you can use some molotov or use a long range weapon/jump attacks safely . <h> Videos <h> Environment <p> Gascoigne 's arena is a circular graveyard with gravestones everywhere and a few trees placed on the edges of the arena . A raised platform with stairs on either side hugs the back of the arena . This platform is accessible during the fight , but the doorway at the top can not be accessed until the Hunter kills Father Gascoigne and gains the Oedon Tomb Key <h> Notes <p> Summon locations : 1 ) Down the stairs left of the Central Yarnham lantern . 2 ) In the middle of the courtyard with the troll banging on the gate ( past the lamp area ) . <p> He is using the Hunter Pistol for his firearm , but strangely it fires shots similar to the Hunter Blunderbuss . <h> Lore <p> Gascoigne most likely came to Yharnam from a foreign place where he earned the Father title . According to Gascoigne 's Cap , " Father " is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no such rank in the Healing Church . <p> The reason for Gascoigne moving to Yharnam is unknown but it 's likely that he moved there in search of Yharnam 's healing blood . <p> Father Gascoigne became a hunter after receiving a blood transfusion , like many others and partnered himself with another hunter named Henryk . <p> After taking so much blood , it took it 's toll on Gascoigne and he started to forget himself , getting closer to turning into a beast . <p> On the night of the hunt , Viola goes looking for Gascoigne but forgets to bring the Tiny Music Box . Without it , she has nothing to help Gascoigne remember who he is and to halt his progression of turning into a beast . Therefore , Viola is unfortunately killed by her husband . <p> Alternatively , it 's possible Viola was simply killed by the other Yharnamites on the hunt , the last straw for Gascoigne being discovering Viola 's corpse . <h> Dialogue <p> When first encountered Beasts all over the shop You 'll be one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health What 's that smell ?

@@107103199 @2503199/ <h> Strategy <p> This build has higher HP , and a chunk of stamina to work with . Yet , the damage output is not as significant as possible . Typically , builds like so will make PVP fights last longer and be more interesting . A skilled interrupter will make this build most effective . Spamming bullets will result in maybe some visceral attacks , but it is most useful to interrupt when you know you can . Speaking of which , the Wooden shield is only to be equipped if someone is bullet spamming . It eats them up like that overweight guy in Burger King .
