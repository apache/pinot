These regulations repeal the current Article 6 addressing clear and reasonable warnings and replace them with an aim to provide clarity in terms of responsibilities while offering framework guidance for what constitutes a clear and reasonable ' warning . <p> The new language required for the warning labels is effective August 30 , 2018 . In the interim period , both the current and new versions of the labels may be used . <p> Summary of key provisions of the new Subarticle 1 for clear and reasonable warnings include : <p> This is the mandatory portion of the regulations . <p> The Subarticle provides definitions , elaborates on the roles and responsibilities of a retailer vs. a manufacturer and the chain of responsibility to provide consumer product exposure warnings placing responsibility primarily on the manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product or fulfill their obligations by providing a written notice to the authorized agent for the retail seller . <p> If providing a written notice , the manufacturer is required to collect a confirmation of receipt of warning initially within the first six months of the product 's placement on the market and annually thereafter for each renewed notice . <p> The retailer is required to properly place and maintain the warnings received on products and further convey them for internet sales . <p> Retailers responsibility for providing the warnings themselves have been clarified to be only for the following circumstances : <p> Retailer-owned or licensed brands trademarks <p> Instances where the retailer knowingly introduces a chemical listed by Prop 65 into the product <p> When the retailer has covered , obscured or otherwise altered the warning on the product <p> When the retail seller received a notice and warning materials from the manufacturer <p> And when the retailer has no knowledge of the potential consumer exposure <p> Subarticle 2 that provides revised Prop 65 warnings are meant as guidelines . Manufacturers/retailers may choose to offer warnings that differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content and format requirements . Key changes to the warning formats for consumer product exposure include : <p> Warnings shall consistent of a symbol of a black exclamation point within a yellow equilateral triangle . Where the sign , label or shelf tag for the pro duct is not printed using the color yellow , the symbol may be printed in black and white . The symbol is to be placed to the left of the word WARNING ' and in a font size no smaller than the signal word . <p> The word WARNING ' needs to be in bold and capital letters . <p> Warnings shall list the name of one or more chemicals on the Prop 65 list contained in the product for which the warning is being provided as well as the harm from exposure , i.e. , cancer or reproductive harm . <p> On product abbreviated warnings are sufficient as long as the harmful exposure is listed .

The amendments adopted by the AG address : <p> Transparency : <p> Where settlements require reformulation , plaintiffs are expected to provide proof that at least some of the products contained higher than agreed-upon levels of a chemical . <p> Where the plaintiff seeks investigation costs , good record-keeping of all costs to be documented . <p> Settlements and Additional Settlement Payments ( ASP ) : <p> Private enforcer reaching a settlement for noticed violation without complaint shall notify the AG office within five days of settlement . <p> The AG provides a list of criteria for determining whether or not they will object to ASPs included in a settlement including but not limited to activity funded by the ASPs , ASPs to not exceed the OEHHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Amendments provide for the waiver of civil penalties for the defendant in favor of positive conduct by the defendant by requiring settlements to have verification mechanisms .

@@96412739 @612739/ 67316 @qwx927316 <p> The shrinkage factor of crude oil from separator conditions- varies , - dependant upon the pressure and temperature of the separator and the individual fluid properties . The more volatile the separator liquid phase , the more impact separator conditions and shrinkage will be . Shrinkage value will be very dependant upon the separator pressure and temperature and will change as these values vary . <p> Measuring the crude oil shrinkage factor : <p> Good oil shrinkage measurement is best approached by collecting- the primary separator liquid and performing a separator test on it . This- involves simulating shrinkage in the laboratory at each stage of separation ( pressure and temperature ) from primary separator to stock tank conditions . Different liquid streams ( with different compositions ) require laboratory analysis for each stream . The only problem with this approach is if separator conditions change so will the shrinkage . There are a couple of ways to take this into account . <p> Intertek recommends collecting a separator liquid sample at the maximum pressure a- separator will be operated ( preferably at a lowest temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sample is compositionally analyzed and subjected to a separator test , duplicating standard separator conditions from primary separator through stock tank conditions . Examples are of the- primary separator at 1100 psia and 100-F , second stage separator at 750 psia and 85-F , third stage separator at 340 psia and 75-F , fourth stage separator at 120 psia and 105-F , and stock tank at 15 psia and 85-F . Utilizing the composition and the results from the separator test , an equation-of-state ( EOS ) computer model is " tuned " to the measured shrinkage data . This tuned model can then be used to predict shrinkage values at different separator pressure or temperature conditions with the resulting data well within a 5% error band . <p> Alternatively , a series or matrix of separator tests at separator conditions covering the anticipated spread of pressures and temperatures can be performed in the laboratory . These tests generate a matrix of shrinkage values covering the anticipated range . The data can establish a table or equation to yield shrinkage value as a function of separator conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach can be used with the equation-of-state computer model instead of physically performing the matrix of separator tests " it is important to perform one experimentally to tune the EOS , however . <p> Measuring shrinkage factor at the wellsite : <p> The " shrinkage tester " suggested for wellsite installation provides a rough shrinkage value , one that probably is n't is sufficient if your system is a 30-API oil and your separator conditions are not subject to significant change . Typically such equipment employ a vessel filled with separator liquid at pressure ( although not necessarily at temperature ) . The volume of this vessel is known and calibrated . The vessel is then drained into a non-pressurized graduated container while the entrained gas is allowed to escape . The shrinkage value is simply the non-pressurized volume divided by the volume of the pressurized vessel ( dead oil divided by live oil volumes ) . Petroleum table values can correct the non-pressurized volume to standard conditions ( 15-C or 60-F ) although this is often not done , adding yet another error . <p> This method does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure/temperature changes of the liquid as produced by secondary and tertiary separators . On an offshore platform and all the way to the shore base , typically there will be several downstream separators in line from the primary separator . Each one of these separators will have an impact on the shrinkage value and this is part of the reason they are in place . Not taking temperature into account , there will be less shrinkage with more stages of separation as the oil pressure is reduced to atmospheric pressure .

Dielectric strength is defined as the maximum voltage required to produce a dielectric breakdown through the material and is expressed as Volts per unit thickness . A higher dielectric strength represents a better quality of insulator . <p> Test Procedure:There are three basic procedures that can be used to determine the dielectric strength of an insulator . These procedures are the short-time method , the slow rate-of-rise method and the step-by-step method . Each of these three methods has the same basic set-up , which consists of the test specimen placed between two electrodes in air or oil . <p> For the most common test , the short-time method , voltage is applied across the two electrodes and raised from zero to dielectric breakdown at a uniform rate . Breakdown is when an electrical burn-through punctures the sample , or decomposition occurs in the specimen . The rate of voltage rise is determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The slow-rate-of rise method starts at 50% of the breakdown voltage as determined by the short-time-method and is increased at a uniform rate . <p> The step-by-step method starts at 50% of the short-time-test then voltage is increased at equal increments for a specified time period until breakdown . The test is sometimes performed in oil to prevent arcing from the electrode to the ground . <p> Specimen size:The recommended specimen type for this test is a 4 inch plaque or larger . Any specimen thickness can be used ; however the most common thickness is between 0.8 to 3.2 mm ( 0.032 to 0.125 inch ) . Specimens over 2 mm thick are typically tested in oil to decrease the chance of flashover before breakdown . <p> Data:Dielectric strength is calculated by dividing the breakdown voltage by the thickness of the sample . The data is expressed in Volts/mil . The location of the failure is also recorded . A higher dielectric strength represents a better quality of insulator. - 67315 @qwx927315

Izod impact is defined as the kinetic energy needed to initiate fracture and continue the fracture until the specimen is broken . Izod specimens are notched to prevent deformation of the specimen upon impact . This test can be used as a quick and easy quality control check to determine if a material meets specific impact properties or to compare materials for general toughness . <p> Test Procedure:The specimen is clamped into the pendulum impact test fixture with the notched side facing the striking edge of the pendulum . The pendulum is released and allowed to strike through the specimen . If breakage does not occur , a heavier hammer is used until failure occurs . Since many materials ( especially thermoplastics ) exhibit lower impact strength at reduced temperatures , it is sometimes appropriate to test materials at temperatures that simulate the intended end use environment . <p> Reduced Temperature Test procedure:The specimens are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach equilibrium . The specimens are quickly removed , one at a time , from the freezer and impacted . Neither ASTM n or ISO specify a conditioning time or elapsed time from freezer to impact - typical values from other specifications are 6 hours of conditioning and 5 seconds from freezer to impact . <p> Specimen size:The standard specimen for ASTM is 64 x 12.7 x 3.2 mm ( 2-+ x -+ x 1/8 inch ) . The most common specimen thickness is 3.2 mm ( 0.125 inch ) , but the preferred thickness is 6.4 mm ( 0.25 inch ) because it is not as likely to bend or crush .

@@96412770 @612770/ 67316 @qwx927316 <h> Frequently Asked Questions About the CB Scheme <p> Through the CB Scheme , we can help you gain access to the global markets you desire . Below are some frequently asked questions about the CB Scheme . <p> Q : What is the CB Scheme ? <p> A : The CB Scheme is an international program for exchange and acceptance of product safety test results among participating laboratories and certification organizations around the world . The CB Scheme offers manufacturers a simplified way of obtaining multiple national safety certifications for their products . <p> Q : What does " CB Scheme " stand for ? <p> A : The " CB " in CB Scheme stands for Certification Body . The official name of the CB Scheme is actually the " Scheme of the IECEE for Mutual Recognition of Test Certificates for Electrical Equipment . " <p> Q : How does the CB Scheme work ? <p> A : A manufacturer applies to any of the participating National Certification Bodies ( NCBs ) for a CB Test Certificate ( Intertek has three NCBs : Toronto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sweden ) . The NCB will will work with one of their accredited CBTLs ( Intertek has thirty-eight CBTLs around the world ) to conduct complete testing and evaluation of the manufacturer 's product to determine conformity with the appropriate IECEE standard . If the product is found to be in compliance with the standard , the CBTL will issue a CB Test Report , based on which the NCB will issue a CB Test Certificate . In many cases , per a manufacturer 's request , the NCB will also issue its own national approval or certification for the product . ( Intertek can issue our own Marks : ETL Listed Mark for USA and Canada , S Mark for Europe , GS Mark for Germany . ) The manufacturer can then present the CB Test Report and CB Test Certificate to other participating NCBs in order to obtain additional certifications for its product through simplified procedures . <p> Q : How can the CB Scheme benefit me ? <p> A : The CB Scheme can help you save money , save time , obtain certifications more quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a manufacturer applies to NCB for national certification based on its previously obtained CB Test Certificate , the NCB will normally grant its certification with minimal , if any , re-testing provided that the results of the NCB 's examination of the product , the CB Test Certificate , and the CB Test Report are favorable . In addition , NCBs are encouraged to handle applications for certification based on CB Test Certificates on a priority basis . As a result , costs for testing and evaluation are normally reduced , certifications are granted in less time than in normal cases , additional test samples are not damaged or destroyed , and the time and effort needed by the manufacturer 's personnel to support the project are minimized . Intertek can assist with the application to many NCBs around the world to further simplify this process for the manufacturer . <p> Q : Does the system really work ? <p> A : Absolutely . The increasing amount of manufacturers seeking certification through the CB Scheme will find that the participating NCBs truly honor their commitments to the rules of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a refreshing simplification and acceleration of the certification process and market entry . <p> Q : How can I apply for CB Scheme certification ? <p> A : A manufacturer can apply to any NCB for either a CB Test Certificate or for certification based on an existing CB Test Certificate . The NCB will provide details on fees , samples , documents , and certification procedures applicable in the country of the NCB . <p> Q : What standards and product categories are covered by the CB Scheme ? <p> A : The scope of products covered by the CB Scheme is quite broad . It includes categories such as IT and Office Equipment , Household Electronics and Appliances , Lighting Equipment , Testing and Measuring Equipment , Electrical Medical Equipment and Portable Tools , as well as many others . The standards used are the various IEC standards corresponding to these product categories , although it is important to note that national differences to these IEC standards exist for many of the participating countries . It is advised to notify the NCB which countries this product shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into consideration . <p> A : Compliance with national differences may be evaluated either by the NCB issuing the CB Test Certificate and CB Test Report , or by the NCB to whom the CB Test Certificate and CB Test Report are presented for recognition and acceptance . However , it may further reduce costs , completion time , sample requirements , and project complexity by having all appropriate national differences evaluated by the NCB who issues the CB Test Certificate and CB Test Report . <p> Q : How can I learn more about the CB Scheme ? <p> A : You can learn more about the CB Scheme by contacting any of our Intertek offices or visiting IECEE 's web site .

@@96412873 @612873/ 67316 @qwx927316 <h> Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry ASTM E168 , ASTM E1252 <p> FTIR can generate an infrared spectral scan of samples that absorb infrared light . <p> Scope : <p> Standards include : ASTM E168 , E1252 <p> If the material does not absorb infrared light a spectral scan can not be obtained . Example : metals do not absorb infrared light . <p> FTIR is the first logical step in identifying a polymer . FTIR is also used for quality control of materials and for contamination analysis ( surface or internal ) . <p> Test Procedure:A material 's absorbance of infrared light at different frequencies produces a unique " spectral fingerprint " based upon the frequencies at which the material absorbs infrared light and the intensity of those absorptions . The resulting spectral scan ( absorbance or transmittance ) is usually specific to a general class of material . Example : the spectral scan of Polycarbonate does not look like the scan of Nylon but all Nylon scans have unique similarities . <p> Unknown spectral scans can be analyzed to determine the base material of the unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are stored in a computer-based library . <p> A typical infrared scan is generated in the mid-infrared region of the light spectrum . The mid-infrared region is from 400 to 4000 wavenumbers , which equals wavelengths of 2.5 to 25 microns ( 10-3mm ) . <p> Matching the unknown infrared spectrum to known spectra can be done manually or with the help of a computerized program . Computerized spectral searches can quickly compare an unknown spectrum to a very large number of spectra located in multiple databases in a very short period of time . <p> Computerized spectral matches to the unknown spectral scan are presented from best to worst with assigned certainty ratings . Computer programs are very helpful for comparing unknown spectral scans to those of known materials , but computer selected matches can be misleading . A skilled FTIR analyst is needed to examine the computer selected spectral matches to ensure that sample identifications are both accurate and complete . Computer matching programs have difficulties with subtle differences that can be critically important . <p> Sample size required:Samples the size of a single resin pellet can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easily tested by reflective FTIR , include polymer pellets , parts , opaque samples , fibers , powders , wire coatings , and liquids . <p> Materials with large quantities of carbon ( carbon black or carbon fiber ) are difficult to obtain a usable spectral scan from because carbon strongly absorbs infrared light in a broad range of frequencies . This results in an FTIR spectrum without the minute details necessary to identify the unknown material . <p> Basic Identification:As previously noted , FTIR polymer identification of an unknown is done by matching the material 's infrared peaks , either transmittance or absorbance , to the peaks of similar infrared scans of known materials . The better the match , the higher the certainty for a correct identification of the unknown polymer . <p> An FTIR spectral analysis can easily identify classes of polymers such as Nylons , Polyesters , Polypropylenes , Polycarbonates , Acetals , or Polyethylenes . However , an FTIR spectral scan alone should not be expected to identify the type of Nylon or Polyester , identify a Polypropylene or Acetal as a homopolymer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ density or low density material . <p> Further identification may be aided by DSC.Further identification may be aided by an Ash Test . <p> Quality Control:A spectral scan of a reference material can be generated and stored in a spectral library database . A stored reference scan will allow all future material scans to be compared back to the same earlier scan . The objective is to look for material differences . Differences noted in a newly generated spectral scan could indicate a change in processing or a possible contamination problem . <p> Internal Polymer Contamination:FTIR spectral subtractions are used to look for internal contamination in polymers . A computer program is used to subtract the peaks associated with the base polymer from the spectral scan and then an analysis of the remaining spectral scan is performed . <p> The amount of contamination that can be detected depends on the spectral scans of the base polymer and the contaminant . Contamination involving materials with very different infrared spectra can usually be detected at a level of about 1-2% . Contamination involving materials with similar infrared spectra may not show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contamination of polymers can be analyzed by normal reflective FTIR because the infrared beam only enters a few microns into the sample surface . Another method to look for a possible surface contamination involves a solvent wash of the sample 's surface . <p> A solvent wash involves using a solvent that is nondestructive to the sample . A solvent wash of the sample 's surface is collected and evaporated to dryness on the FTIR reflective sample area . Once the solvent is evaporated off an FTIR analysis is performed on the solvent wash residue . 67315 @qwx927315

Since the physical properties of many materials ( especially thermoplastics ) can vary depending on ambient temperature , it is sometimes appropriate to test materials at temperatures that simulate the intended end use environment . <p> Flexural Test Procedure- <p> Most commonly the specimen lies on a support span and the load is applied to the center by the loading nose producing three point bending at a specified rate . The parameters for this test are the support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum deflection for the test . These parameters are based on the test specimen thickness and are defined differently by ASTM and ISO . For ASTM D790 , the test is stopped when the specimen reaches 5% deflection or the specimen breaks before 5% . For ISO 178 , the test is stopped when the specimen breaks . If the specimen does not break , the test is continued as far a possible and the stress at 3.5% ( conventional deflection ) is reported . <p> Elevated or Reduced Temperature Test Procedure- <p> A thermal chamber is installed on the universal test machine . The chamber is designed to allow the test mounts from the base and crosshead of the universal tester to pass through the top and bottom of the chamber . Standard test fixtures are installed inside the chamber , and testing is conducted inside the controlled thermal environment , the same as it would be at ambient temperature . The chamber has internal electric heaters for elevated temperatures , - using external carbon dioxide gas as a coolant for reduced temperatures . <p> Specimen size <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the most commonly used specimen size for ASTM is 3.2mm x 12.7mm x 125mm ( 0.125 " x 0.5 " x 5.0 " ) and for ISO is 10mm x 4mm x 80mm. 67315 @qwx927315

@@96413055 @613055/ 67316 @qwx927316 <p> There are several testing techniques to choose from when measuring glass transition temperature . But how do you know which one is best for you ? <h> 15 April 2013 <p> The thermal properties of polymeric materials are important to the function of components and assemblies that will operate in warm environments . Glass Transition Temperature ( referred herein as Tg ) is the point at which a material goes from a hard brittle state to a soft rubbery state . Amorphous polymers only have a Tg . Crystalline polymers exhibit a Tm ( melt temperature ) and typically a Tg since there is usually an amorphous portion as well ( " semi " -crystalline ) . Identifying the Tg of polymers is of interest for various reasons , but is most often used for quality control and research and development . <p> There are three general techniques for measuring Tg : <p> Differential Scanning Calorimetry ( DSC ) " This is probably the most traditional and common technique for most polymeric materials . Simply stated , DSC utilizes a heat flow technique and compares the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly heated " reference " to determine transition points . Tg is typically calculated by using a half-height technique in the transition region . The heating rate and sample heat history are a couple of factors that may affect the test result . Depending on the equipment capability , DSC can be used for a wide range of thermoplastic and thermoset polymers . For materials that have broad Tg 's , DSC may not be sensitive enough to show a large enough transition for calculation purposes . <p> Thermal Mechanical Analysis ( TMA ) " TMA is used to measure Coefficient of Thermal Expansion ( CTE ) of polymers . TMA uses a mechanical approach for measuring Tg . A sensitive probe measures the expansion of the test specimen when heated . Polymers typically expand as temperature is increased . From the expansion curve , a CTE can be calculated over a temperature range . If a material goes through a Tg during a TMA test , the curve shape changes significantly and Tg can be calculated by using an onset technique . Amorphous polymers would typically not utilize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the probe penetrates into the sample . Samples that remain somewhat rigid through Tg would be good candidates for Tg by TMA . The heating rate chosen can affect the Tg . <p> Dynamic Mechanical Analysis ( DMA ) " DMA is probably the most sensitive technique ( of the discussed methods ) for Tg analysis . DMA measures the response of a material to an applied oscillatory strain ( or stress ) , and how that response varies with temperature , frequency , or both . DMA is able to separate and measure the elastic and viscous components of polymers . How the material responds to the temperature increase can be illustrated by various means on the DMA graph . There are three typical approaches for reporting Tg by DMA . All techniques are viable but may yield different results . Several results may include : 1 ) Onset of the storage modulus curve ; 2 ) Peak of the loss modulus curve ; and/or 3 ) Peak of the Tan Delta curve . <p> There also are different modes of oscillation used for DMA such as torsional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-point bend and compression . Various heating rates , frequencies and strains can be utilized as well . All of these variables can affect the Tg . Compared to DSC , DMA can be 10 to 100 times more sensitive to the changes occurring at the Tg . DMA is useful for polymers with difficult to find Tg 's such as epoxies , polymers with Tg 's well below ambient temperature and highly crosslinked polymers . It is important to note Tg by DMA can vary significantly from one reporting technique to the next . <p> As you can see there are various approaches to obtain Tg of polymeric materials . Sometimes trial and error has to be used to see what technique is best . It is extremely important to know which technique and test parameters were used to determine Tg if comparing back to historical data . Similarly , if testing to a specification or industry standard , the technique and test parameters must be well defined . Even within a test technique , the means of obtaining the Tg can be performed various ways and the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or DMA rarely will be the same and can vary by as much as 20-C or more . <p> Have you had experiences where one technique worked much better than another ?

Gelbo flex testing can upgrade an annual characterization , evaluate the competition or benchmark claims in the industry . <p> During the Gelbo test , thin flexible materials are repeatedly twisted and crushed at 45 cycles per minute . Flex failure is determined typically by evaluating pinholes or other diminished properties . The test is demonstrated in this short video . <p> The standards used for Gelbo Flex Testing can vary , but one commonly used is ASTM F392 . Following are three parameters to consider when conducting Gelbo flex testing under this standard . <p> 1 . Number of Cycles <p> There are five common conditions for the Gelbo testing , ranging from Condition A ( 2700 cycles ) to Condition D ( 20 cycles ) for full flex cycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flex cycle . The test for each is application- and film-dependent . To determine how many cycles will be needed , consider the following : <p> A common metalized snack bag will most likely not see failures even at Condition A ( 2700 full cycles ) <p> A clear snack bag may see failures at the seal at Condition A ( 2700 full cycles ) <p> Flexible composite webbing may start to show failures in the form of delamination at Condition D ( 20 full cycles ) <p> 2 . Samples and Controls <p> Sample management is the key to acquiring accurate data . The ASTM standard requires controls ; film may be tested in both directions . A control may identify quality issues at the processing level . Directionality ( machine and transverse ) of film can also exhibit deviances in durability . Keep in mind , seams may be considered for evaluation as well . In the end , be prepared to provide control specimens , identified seams for evaluation ( if required ) and clearly identify direction of film/packaging . <p> 3 . Evaluations <p> Evaluations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A dye wash to determine pinholes is typical for this test . During this procedure , a red dye is brushed over the flexed specimen and a blank sheet of paper is placed under the specimen to be evaluated for ink bleed . A finding of more than 50 pinholes per 300cm2 is considered significant . The pinhole method may just be enough to discover if durability has been compromised . A barrier test such as water vapor transmission rate may also be used to determine breakdown . After evaluations are complete , it may be helpful to request the samples back from the lab to review the types of failures such as rips , tears and general damage . <p> With the addition of dynamic tests such as Gelbo flex testing to material evaluation programs , substantial discoveries may come to light about the durability of film . The test demonstrates how properties diminish upon repeated flexure -information that is useful when evaluating the competitive landscape or benchmarking claims in the industry .

EFSA is now reviewing public comments on these guidance documents . <p> Regarding novel food applications , the guidance provides a clear outline regarding the data requirements , including a description of the novel food , the production process , compositional data , history of use , proposed uses and anticipated intakes ( see here for our webinar on EFSA 's guidance on intake estimates for food enzymes ) , safety data and information on allergenicity . EFSA highlighted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food needs to be critically appraised and provided , as well as a discussion and justification for any uncertainties within the dataset . <p> Similar quality requirements are required for traditional foods ; however , safety is supported by a comprehensive discussion as to the history of use of the food in other countries , including , extent of use , cultivation/harvesting , consumption levels , role in the diet , specific population characteristics , and preparation precautions . This is not always a simple task ! <p> Having participated in recent government stakeholder meetings in Brussels this spring and reviewing the available documentation , Intertek 's EU food regulatory expert , Nigel Baldwin , provides the following insights for novel food applicants : <p> The allowance for the use of scientific arguments to justify deviations from guidance data requirements , could create delays during the non-scientific screening ( i.e. , checklist ) phase of application submissions as screeners may not be equipped to evaluate the strength of these arguments . <p> As well the variable quality of these scientific arguments may bog down the process through on-going back-and-forth between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new regulations was to streamline the process and make it transparent . <p> Flexibility of using scientific arguments will be helpful for those that have the expertise to use it effectively ! <p> The new draft guidance is much better than the old Scientific Committee on Foods Guidance , which was set up mainly with genetically modified foods in mind . It reflects EFSA 's current thinking . Applicants must follow the old guidance , until inception of the new regulation on January 1 , 2018 . Any applications that are pending during that cross-over date will be automatically switched over to the new system . This could create problems for applicants with applications pending as they could be considered incomplete under the new system . <p> Careful planning of novel food application submission timings now will be important in order to avoid unnecessary delays in the future . <p> There are various proposed methods for estimating dietary intakes and comments from the workgroup meetings suggested using portion size as as an intakes measure . EFSA responded that on a case-by-case basis this may be appropriate . <p> Understanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate method will be very important in accurately estimating the potential exposure to the ingredient , while still supporting safety . If in doubt get help ! <p> Changes in Substantial Equivalence dossiers ? <p> Companies will no longer be able to use the simplified ( substantially equivalent ) notification procedure but will be able to use the same type of reasoned approach within the full application procedure based on a Union list of authorized novel foods . In other words , once a novel food is approved and added to the Union list , any company can market an identical novel food that meets the requirements ( unless the scientific data is held as confidential for the 5 year exclusive use period ) . <p> This certainly simplifies the process but companies will want to ensure data is held confidentially to give them the 5 years before competitors can " piggy-back " off their approval . <p> The European Commission reported that there have been approximately 180 novel food applications submitted since 1997 and that approximately 80 have been authorised for use in the EU .

In order for your product to be successful , it needs to satisfy what people want and need . While there are many ways to capture insights from the consumer , including one-on-one interviews , focus groups and surveys , there is one key area many brands overlook : consumer reviews . <p> When a consumer is interested in purchasing a product online or in a brick-and-mortar store , what is the first thing that they typically do ? Usually , they visit websites to research the product and to read reviews from others who have already purchased the product . Online reviews are extremely important because they have the power to influence a potential customer to buy or not buy . - In addition to a star rating system , these reviews often contain very useful information such as likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - The online reviews also provide manufacturers with valuable insight into the consumers ' preferences . This information can then be applied to the development of future products . <p> If insights from online reviews are not currently incorporated into your product development process , you should definitely start . Online review content is available for free at several online retailers and there is no need to limit reviews to your particular product . Capturing information from competitive products and similar products in your target market are equally as valuable . <p> How do you use online reviews to your benefit ? The first step is to look for specific terms related to the reviewer 's perception of the product , while keeping track of the number of times that these specific terms are mentioned across reviewers .

@@96413133 @613133/ 67316 @qwx927316 <h> Verifying the Effectiveness of Corrective Action <p> When I first got into quality , I really hated verifying the effectiveness of actions taken to correct a problem . After all , I was young and inexperienced . All of the people whose actions I was verifying were older , wiser , and more experienced than I was . Who was I to say that their actions were effective or ineffective ? My assumptions were as follows : <p> If they said they did something , then they certainly did it . <p> Whatever they did was directly related to the problem causes , or they would n't have done it . <p> The action must have been effective ; they would have told me otherwise . <p> All of these assumptions had to be correct , because I was working with seasoned professionals , right ? Ha ! Boy , did I learn a lesson . <p> People just want to get paperwork off their desks or out of their in-boxes as quickly as possible . Taking actions on problems is one of many responsibilities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top priority . That 's why it 's crucial that action be carefully verified . Verification is not an act of suspicion or disrespect ; it 's simply a necessary part of problem solving . <p> What exactly is being verified ? You are seeking evidence that the causes of the problem have been removed or reduced . In a perfect world , each problem cause would be removed . Poof , it 's gone . This is not always possible , though . Sometimes the best you can hope for is a reduction of the causes . The cause is still there , but it manifests itself less frequently or less severely . So the best option is to remove the cause , but the next best option is to at least reduce the cause . <h> Evidence <p> The key to verification is evidence . You are seeking objective , factual evidence that your problem causes have been reduced or removed . This evidence usually takes the form of data or records . Another powerful form of evidence is your own first-hand observations . That 's not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , data , and first-hand observations are certainly better . <p> The exact amount of evidence depends on the magnitude of the problem . Broader and more severe problems lead to more profound solutions , which in turn require more evidence to verify effectiveness . It is a simple matter of scale . The scale of verification must match the scale of the actions taken . <p> It 's important to note that you 're sampling evidence . You 're taking a representative subgroup of all the available evidence . A 100-percent investigation of evidence is not necessary or particularly effective . Take what you believe to be a balanced and representative sample of the evidence . Shown in figure 1 are some examples of evidence to sample , all related to a problem with orders being late . <h> Problem : Late Orders <p> Evidence <p> Type of Sample <p> Service records <p> Review 10 service records from last week to see if work was performed on time <p> Customers <p> Contact three of the customers who reported late orders and see if they have noticed an improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've been revised to include recently implemented improvements <p> Employees <p> Interview three employees at random .

If we positively verify this evidence , then we can logically conclude that the actions were effective . Of course , the specific type of evidence and sample sizes will vary , depending on the nature of the problem and the magnitude of actions . <h> Verification Method <p> You do n't just show up in a department and start asking for evidence .

Surprise verifications are not needed , as a broad-based examination of evidence will always reveal the true state of corrective action effectiveness . <p> Communication about the verification process will remove roadblocks and smooth your path . The following telephone conversation illustrates the type of communication to engage in prior to verification of effectiveness of corrective actions . <p> You : " Hello , Jill . Do you mind if I drop by your department today and verify the effectiveness of actions you 've taken on the late order problem ? " <p> Jill : " Uh , I guess not . How long will it take ? " <p> You : " It should n't take long at all . I just need to sample some evidence related to our actions . " <p> Jill : " Do you suspect that we did n't take action ?

" <p> You : " Thanks for all your cooperation . I 'll see you about 10 . " <p> As this discussion indicates , people do n't always understand the intent of verifying effectiveness . They may think it 's vindictive or personal , and you want to remove this misconception as quickly as possible . Your verification of effectiveness will be objective , factual , and impersonal . Make sure everybody understands that prior to your arrival . Your verification will go much smoother . <p> Once you 're in the department , what exactly are you going to verify ? Obviously , the evidence will differ on a case by case basis , but here are some of the most common verification points : <p> Did the actions address problem causes , instead of just symptoms ? - Taking action on symptoms is akin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does nothing to treat the underlying causes . The actions taken must get beyond the superficial symptoms and address the underlying causes of the problem , removing or significantly reducing them . The single biggest reason for problem-solving failure is action on symptoms instead of true causes . <p> Are the actions fully implemented ? - Speak to the people responsible for planning and taking action . Have their plans been fully implemented ? Are there steps that are pending ? What obstacles exist ? You ca n't verify effectiveness until actions have been fully carried out . <p> Have procedures been revised or developed ? - Improvements do n't stick unless they are made the new norm . Make sure that all relevant documentation reflects the new methods put in place by the corrective action . <p> Are employees aware of and knowledgeable about the changes ? - If a process has been improved , employees will typically know about it , especially if they are responsible for implementing the change . Speak to employees in the work area and see if they 're familiar with the changes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may come from formal training processes or through informal communications . If formal training is used , then records of training would be another type of evidence that could be verified . <p> Are products or outcomes improved ? - This is the bottom line : Have the products been improved ? An improved process should ultimately lead to improved products . Is there evidence that this has happened ? What do records and data indicate ? Hearsay and verbal affirmations ca n't be used to prove that products have been improved . <p> Has measurement or monitoring been established ? - The effectiveness of some corrective action ca n't be known without ongoing measurement or monitoring of the process . In these cases , have the controls been set and put in place ? What do the measurements indicate ? Does the data indicate the process has improved and stabilized to the new level ? <p> What is the customer 's perception of an improvement ? - Perceptions are everything . Have customers noticed a change in the quality of goods or services ? Keep in mind that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers and get their opinions . If customers have not noticed an improvement , it can be logically argued that the actions have not been effective . <p> Has the problem reoccurred ? - If the problem continues to occur at the same level as before , then the corrective action is not effective . Only data and records can be used to prove a lack of recurrence . <p> Is top management aware of the corrective action ? - Top management is n't expected to be aware of every corrective action in the organization , but they should be aware of the large ones and overall trends . Top management awareness would certainly help support a determination of full implementation and communication . <h> Ineffective Actions <p> It 's unfortunate that in reality not everything you verify will be effective for improvement . The most common reasons for this are because solutions did n't work , or the problem-solving actions were never fully implemented , or the corrective actions were aimed at the problem 's symptoms instead of its causes . When you determine that actions are ineffective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe the actions are ineffective and describe the evidence that led you to that conclusion . Get the process owner 's perspective on the situation . Through an interactive discussion , you usually arrive at an agreement about effectiveness or , in this case , the lack thereof . <p> Once an agreement has been reached and the facts are clear , determine the next steps to take . Usually the next steps involve revisiting the identification of the causes , and planning and implementing a new plan of action . It 's possible that you may need to facilitate the new corrective action . A little bit of coaching can go a long way , especially when the person taking action has hit a roadblock and is n't clear how to proceed . <p> If called upon to facilitate a corrective action that was initially ineffective , here are some principles to reinforce : <p> Planning ensures success . - The better the plan for implementation , the more likely the action is to be successful . Many people will define their plans in broad , sweeping terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to say , " Install a new blower above the No. 3 oven , " sounds clear , but there is a world of complexity within that single statement . It 's often easier to break large actions into bite-sized tasks delegated to employees who can be assigned responsibilities , resources , due dates , and reviews . <p> Communicate early and often. - When planning action , build frequent communication into the plan . This communication can be in many different forms ( i.e. , meetings , formal reviews , teleconferences , e-mail updates , written reports , etc . ) . Frequent communication makes it harder for commitments to fall through the cracks . Visibility and transparency are the allies of effective action . <p> Stay focused on the causes . - When entering the later phases of problem solving , actions take center stage and the causes tend to fade in significance . Fight this tendency . It 's critically important that everyone remember exactly what causes are being removed or reduced . Examine and re-examine the actions to make sure they 're affecting the underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Get creative . - When actions are ineffective , it 's often because what we 've chosen to do is tired and stale . They 're the same old actions people tried years ago that did n't work then and do n't work now . What is needed is a big dose of creativity . One of the easiest ways to trigger creativity is to bring new and more diverse people onto the problem-solving team . An injection of new blood will often make the difference . Another effective creativity technique is doing a second brainstorming session on the causes . Sometimes ineffective actions produce a deeper understanding of what is causing the problem . <p> Make change happen . - Effective solutions will regularly change the way work is done . Ineffective solutions are often the result from re-training on old methods , re-enforcing flawed procedures , and asking people to try harder . None of these actually change anything . Is it any wonder that the problem persists ? If we fail to change the work , we usually fail to reduce or remove the problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Help the team look at the problem and its causes from a new perspective . Injecting a little fun and humor into the process also helps at this point . After all , team members do become frustrated . Humor and fun are brain lubricants , and brains need all the lubrication they can get during problem solving .
