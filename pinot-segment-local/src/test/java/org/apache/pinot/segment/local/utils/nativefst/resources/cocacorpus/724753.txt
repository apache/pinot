The US Department of Labor defines a sweatshop as a factory that violates two or more labor laws , such as those pertaining to wages and benefits , child labor or working hours . In general , a sweatshop can be described as a workplace where workers are subject to extreme exploitation , including the absence of a living wage or benefits , poor working conditions , and arbitrary discipline , such as verbal and physical abuse . Since sweatshop workers are paid less than their daily expenses , they are never able to save any money to improve their lives . They are trapped in an awful cycle of exploitation . <p> Defenders of sweatshops often bring up the fact that even though sweatshops are bad , they at least give people jobs they would n't have had otherwise .

They are native to all continents except for Australia and Antarctica . There are about 100 types of deer , including the whitetail deer , reindeer , elk , moose , mule deer , blacktail deer and caribou . <p> Male deer are called bucks , bulls , stags or harts . Female deer are called does , cows or hinds . Young deer are called fawns or calfs . <p> Deer can adapt well to just about any habitat . They prefer to live in " edge " habitats .

Deer lick their nose to keep it moist , which helps odor particles stick to it , improving their sense of smell . The nose also plays a role in communication . Deer produce scents with glands located on their head , legs and hooves . These scents provide information to other deer about their gender , social status , physical condition and whether an area is safe . <p> Deer usually stay in the same area called a home range . These areas are shared by related females who form matriarchies and that exclude adult males . <p> The breeding season for deer occurs between October and January . This period is called the " rut " . During the " rut " the necks of the male deer will swell to more than double their normal diameter and their antlers will have lost their velvet . This will prepare them for fights with other buck to determine dominance and breeding rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt .

Fawns are able to stand and walk shortly after birth . The mother keeps them hidden in bushes and checks up on them about 6 times a day to feed them . Young deer stay with their mothers for 1-2 years . <p> When deer feel threatened , they will raise their tail to warn other deer . <p> Bucks mark their territory by making scrapes on the land with their hooves and by removing bark from trees with their antlers , called a " buck rub " . <p> Deer are ruminants ( cud chewers ) and have a four-chambered stomach .

By slowing down , they can get by eating only about one third of the food they normally eat . They will also hang out in the woods more to escape the cold winds . <p> Deer are born with four baby teeth and develop baby incisors and premolars in their first months . Their adult teeth come in and replace the baby teeth when they are about 18 months old . You can guess the age of deer by looking at the type of teeth they have and by how worn these teeth are .

@@83894114 @5394114/ <h> Lobsters <p> Lobsters are invertebrates , members of the Class Crustacea of the Phylum Arthropoda . This class includes animals without backbones and with hard shells like crab , shrimp , crayfish , water fleas and wood lice . <p> A male lobster is called a cock and a female a hen or chicken ( when she weighs about 1 pound ) . <p> There are two kinds of lobsters , the " true " lobster ( also called American lobster ) and the spiny lobster . The true lobster has claws on the first four legs , lacking in the spiny lobster . The spiny lobster has a pair of horns above the eyes , lacking in the true lobster . Spiny lobsters also have two large cream-colored spots on the top of the second segment of the tail . <p> Small lobsters , less than 1.5 inches carapace ( carapace length is measured from the rear of the eye socket to the rear of the main body shell ) , hide in and about sea weeds and rocky habitat that provide enough food and shelter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are found in coastal habitats and offshore areas . Adult lobsters inhabit deeper waters , but return seasonally to shallow warmer waters . Spiny lobsters inhabit tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean , Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico . <p> Lobster can have many different colors , including blue-green , blue , red , yellow , red-orange and white . Some lobsters come in two colors , having half of their shell one color and the other half another . <p> Lobsters grow by molting , or shedding their shells . Before they shed the old shell , they will form a thin one underneath . When molting , they secrete enzymes that soften the shell and connective joints . Lobsters will then struggle out of their old shell while simultaneously absorbing water which expands their body size . This process takes about 15 minutes . Each time they molt , they will increase their size about 20% . <p> After molting , lobsters will eat voraciously . They often eat their old shell which will replenish the lost calcium and speed up the hardening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks before their new shell is hard enough for lobsters to be able to protect themselves against their natural enemies . While they are soft and fragile , lobsters will bury themselves in the mud or hide under rocks . <p> A young , immature lobster ( first 5-7 years ) will molt about 25 times a year . An adult male lobster molts twice a year and an adult female lobster once a year , usually in the summer . When lobsters get older , they will molt only once every 3-4 years . <p> The only way to gauge the exact age of a lobster would be by their shell . However , since lobsters shed their shells so often , it is impossible to determine their age . Knowledge of body size at age makes scientists believe that lobsters can attain a maximum age of 100 years . The normal life span is about 15 years . Lobsters can grow to be 3 feet long in overall body length . <p> To determine the gender of a lobster , you have to look at the swimmerets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first pair of swimmerets closest to the body are hard and bony on a male and soft and feathery on a female . Only the female has a small shield between the second pair of walking legs , which is the sperm receptacle where she stores the sperm after mating until she lays her eggs . The female also has a wider tail , needed to be able to carry all her eggs . <p> Female lobsters mate primarily when they are in the soft-shell state , right after molting . They can carry live sperm for up to two years until they decide to fertilize their eggs . A 1 pound female will carry about 8,000 eggs . A 9 pound female may carry more than 100,000 eggs . Freshly laid eggs are the size of the head of a pin and are attached to the swimmerets under their mothers tail for almost a year with a glue-like substance . During that year the larvae will molt about six times while still in the egg . <p> When the eggs are ready to hatch , the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as larvae . The larvae will float to the surface for 4 to 6 weeks . At the surface , they are easy prey for sea birds , fish and other enemies . Less than 0.1% of the larvae will survive , settle to the bottom and develop as baby lobsters . <p> Like dolphins , lobsters use complicated signals to establish social relationships . They sometimes walk hand-in-hand , the old leading the young . <p> Lobsters usually hunt for food at night . They eat fish , crabs , clams , snails , sea stars , mussels and sea urchins . By nature , lobsters are not cannibalistic , except when held in crowded conditions . <p> Lobsters chew their food in their stomach , which is very close to their mouth , between three grinding surfaces that look like molar teeth called the " gastric mill " . <p> To escape from enemies , lobsters swim backwards by flipping their tail . <p> The lobster 's body has 19 parts , each covered by a section of the shell .

The four small antennae on the front of their heads are used to " smell " their food or chemicals in the water . The tiny sensory hairs along their legs are used to " taste " their food . Lobsters keep their antennae and eye stalks moving constantly to search for food and to watch for enemies . <p> True lobsters have two very powerful claws . One claw is sharp and used for cutting , the other is bony and used for crushing . Lobsters that have their heavy ( " crusher " ) claw on the right are considered " right-handed " and the others are " left-handed " . Some lobsters are ambidextrous , they usually favor the claw that is the largest . <p> Lobsters can lose claws , legs , eyes and antennae through accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lobsters often fight with other lobsters for territory . If another lobster seizes their claw , they may drop their claw to escape . Sometimes , the more aggressive lobster will tear the claw of the opponent off . A lobster with a claw missing is called a cull . It takes about 3 to 4 molt cycles for the claw to grow back to full size . <p> Lobsters have a sophisticated nervous system that allow them to sense actions that will cause them harm and feel pain . Lobsters do n't have an autonomic nervous system that puts them into a state of shock when they are harmed . For this reason , they will feel pain until their nervous system is completely destroyed .

@@83894148 @5394148/ <h> Minerals <h> Minerals <p> Minerals are inorganic micronutrients . We need them in small amounts to help our body function properly . There are 16 minerals which are essential nutrients and must by supplied by the diet . These minerals are divided into two groups : major and trace minerals . Major minerals , like calcium , chloride , magnesium , phosphorus , potassium , sodium and sulfur , are found in our body in amounts larger than 5 grams . Trace minerals , like chromium , copper , fluoride , iodine , iron , manganese , selenium and zinc , are found in our body in amounts less than 5 grams . <h> Calcium <p> Calcium is important to bone growth and formation , blood clotting and nerve and muscle functioning . It also helps regulate the passage of nutrients in and out of the cell walls , lowers blood pressure , is important to normal kidney function and reduces blood cholesterol levels . It is the most abundant mineral in the body .

Its major function is to combine with protein and copper in making hemoglobin , the component of the blood that carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues throughout the body . People with iron-poor blood tire easily because their bodies are starved for oxygen . Iron builds up the quality of blood and increases resistance to stress and disease . Iron is also part of myoglobin , which is found only in muscle tissue and helps muscles store oxygen . <p> A deficiency may result in weakness , fatigue , paleness of the skin , constipation and anemia . <h> Magnesium <p> Magnesium is an essential mineral . It helps in making new cells , activating B vitamins , blood clotting and the proper functioning of the muscles and nerves . It is also used to convert blood sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A deficiency may result in calcium depletion , heart spasms , nervousness , confusion , kidney stones and muscle twitches . An excess of magnesium may result in mental depression and cardiac arrest . <h> Phosphorus <p> Phosphorus is after calcium the second most abundant mineral in the body . It is a principal mineral of bones and teeth . The main inorganic component of bone is calcium phosphate salts . Phosphorus is involved in most metabolic actions in the body , including kidney functioning , cell growth and the contraction of the heart muscle . It is also involved in converting food to energy . <p> A deficiency is unusual , but may have symptoms varying from painful bones , irregular breathing , fatigue , anxiety , numbness , skin sensitivity and changes in body weight . It is important that the calcium and phosphorus levels of the body are in balance . Higher levels of phosphorus relative to calcium can cause low blood calcium levels , which may result in increased risks of high blood pressure and bowel cancer . <h> Potassium <p> Potassium is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acidity and blood pressure . It is important in controlling the activity of the heart , muscles and the nervous system . Potassium works together with sodium for the nervous system to transmit messages as well as regulating the contraction of muscles .

The body contains more than twice as much potassium as sodium and about 98 percent of the potassium in our body can be found in our cells . <p> A deficiency may result in muscle weakness and heart problems . Healthy kidneys are able to get rid of any extra potassium the body does n't need . Damaged kidneys however , may not be able to get rid of enough potassium resulting in an excess , which can cause an irregular heart beat . <h> Sodium <p> Sodium helps to control the amount of fluid around the body 's cells and helps regulate blood pressure and the volume of blood .

An excess is more common and can lead to increased blood volume and elevated blood pressure , especially when the kidneys do not clear the excess efficiently . Hypertension is more frequent in people who have a high salt intake , especially in people with low levels of potassium in their diets .

Among the social bees are the honeybee ( or hive bee ) and the bumblebee . <p> The bumblebee is round and furry and moves around slowly . The honeybee has a more streamlined body and moves around much faster ( about 15 miles/hour ) . <p> Bees have been producing honey for at least 150 million years . Bees create honey by repeatedly regurgitating and dehydrating nectar . They use this honey as food stores for the hive during the winter when little or no nectar is available to them . <p> Most bees are pacific unless you disturb them , but there are also some aggressive species . The weather often affects the temper of bees . On windy and cloudy days , when they are unable to search for nectar and pollen , bees will be more aggressive . Bee stings can be fatal to someone that is allergic to them . <p> Bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple eyes . Bees can perceive movements that are separated by 1/300th of a second . Humans can only sense movements separated by 1/50th of a second . Bees ca n't recognize the color red , but they can see ultraviolet colors . <p> While foraging for nectar and pollen , bees inadvertently transfer pollen from the male to the female components of flowers . This way they help the fertilization of many of our crop-bearing plants . <p> Honeybees live in colonies of 20,000 to 80,000 bees . A colony includes the queen , workers and drones . <p> Most of the bees in the colony are worker bees . Workers are the smallest bees in the colony . They are sexually undeveloped females produced from fertilized eggs . They build and repair the hive , search for nectar and pollen , produce wax and honey , feed the queen and larvae and protect the hive against enemies . The life span of worker bees depend on the time of year . Most worker bees live about 28 to 35 days . However , workers that are reared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Honeybee colony <p> Carpenter bee <p> Drones are male bees without stingers . They are developed from unfertilized eggs , produced by the queen by withholding sperm . Their sole purpose is to mate with the queen . They do n't collect food or pollen from flowers . If the colony is short on food , drones are often kicked out of the hive . They usually live about 6 months . <p> The workers select the larvae to be raised as queens . These larvae are larger then the worker larvae , because they are fed food bearing a higher sugar content . The first queen to emerge disposes of the other queens by stinging them . Within days she will fly to where the drones assemble and mate in flight for 1-2 days with up to 17 of them . During the mating she will receive about 90 million sperm cells , which are stored in a special pouch ( the spermatheca ) and will last her entire life span of about 2-5 years . <p> About 10 days after mating the queen will start laying eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and night for a total of 1,500 eggs per day . Should she stop her egg-laying pace , her workers will move recently laid eggs into queen cells to produce her replacement . <p> Honeybees fly 55,000 miles and visit 2 million flowers to produce one pound of honey . In one trip , a worker will visit between 50 and 100 flowers . She will return to the hive carrying over half her weight in pollen and nectar . One worker bee will produce about 1/12th of a teaspoon of honey in the course of her lifetime . <p> A productive hive can make and store up to 2 pounds of honey each day . I takes about 35 pounds of honey to provide enough energy for a small colony to survive the winter . Being able to feed on stored supplies makes it possible for honeybees not to hibernate during the winter , like other bees do . They share their body heat by clustering together in dense packs . <p> Social bees like honeybees or bumblebees practice mouth-to-mouth transfers , also known as trophallaxis . Adult bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They also transfer chemical substances and hormones , which helps the communication in the colony . <p> Honeybees feeding mouth-to-mouth <p> Honeybee <p> The stingers of a honeybee are barbed . When the stinger pierces the soft skin of a mammal , the attached venom pouch pumps a mixture containing melittin , histamine and other enzymes into the target . After the bee pulls away , the barb anchors the stinger in the victim 's body . The stinger and venom pouch are left behind and the bee soon dies due to abdominal rupture . The stinger is not left behind when a honeybee stings another insect . <p> Honeybees communicate with each other through a dance " language " . Karl von Frisch received the Nobel Prize in 1973 for deciphering the language , which consists of two basic dances . A dance in a circle for indicating a source of nectar , without giving information about distance or direction . A tail-wagging dance to indicate the exact distance to the nectar source . <p> Bumblebees live in small nests and therefore never swarm . They are larger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the pollen and nectar lie deep , as in red clover . They are also able to work in colder weather than the honeybee . <p> In the spring the bumble queen will begin a new nest with a ball of pollen and wax into which she lays about 6 eggs at a time from which the worker bees will emerge . They will immediately start collecting nectar and the queen will stay in the nest laying more eggs . When the nest has reached the right size ( late summer ) , the queen will lay eggs destined to become drones and next years queen bees . Once hatched the drones will leave the nest and live independent lives . Their only purpose is to mate with the young queens . <p> Unlike honeybees , the young bumble queens live and work in the colony for the rest of the summer and autumn . As the first frosts begins , the old queen , her workers and the independent drones will die . The newly mated queens will survive in hibernation to begin the cycle again next spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just enough to feed their young . <p> Bumblebees are much less aggressive than honeybees .
