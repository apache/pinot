Divide it by 5 : level 48 . Subtract about 5 levels and head to a zone of that level ( Tanaris/Feralas is good for levels 40-45 ) and you should have decent luck leveling your Herbalism there , or just use this guides maps . <p> Find Herbs Use your Find Herbs tool while leveling , do this by left clicking on the icon connected to your minimap and going down to Find Herbs : <p> Click to Move Use Click to Move in your Interface-&gt;Mouse options . It will let you click an herb off in the distance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on arrival . This is very convenient to use for looting . You can even click to loot an herb while mounted , and you will be auto unmounted on arrival . Finally , make sure you have the Gatherer Addon installed and setup properly before using this guide . <h> Leveling from 1-70 <p> From levels 1 to 70 , you 'll gather Silverleaf , Peacebloom , Earthroot and Mageroyal . The best place to start is in Durotar , but if you do n't  want to travel there you can use any of the beginning zones . For Horde I also recommend Mulgore and Tirisfall Glades . If you are Alliance , head to Elwynn Forest or Teldrassil . Most herbs are found near mountains , rivers or trees . Most of the time you are safe traveling the edges of zones , along tree lines or up and down the edges of rivers to find herbs . Do n't  forget , if you want to learn to make gold with Herbalism , read this gold guide first . <p> Horde Durotar , Mulgore , and Tirisfal Glades <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once your herbalism reaches level 70 , you need to head back to a trainer to learn Journeyman Herbalism . Without question , the best place to level beyond 70 is Hillsbrad Foothills . There is a ton of Mageroyal and Briarthorn surrounding the Ruins of Alterac , which will get you all the way to 150 . Once you get to 125 , you can go into the Ruins of Alterac and collect Bruiseweed , this will make 150 come a little faster . <p> Hillsbrad Foothills 70-150 <p> As an alternative , you can go to the Northern Barrens and collect Mageroyal and Briathorn . At level 125 you should head into Stonetalon Mountains and collect Wild Steelbloom and more Briarthorn to get to 150 faster . <p> Alternative : Northern Barrens 70-125 <p> Alternative : Stonetalon Mountains 125-150 <h> Leveling from 150-225 <p> You will need to go to an Herbalism trainer to level past 150 . To get to 225 you can go to either the Western Plaguelands or to Southern Barrens and then Feralas . <p> If you choose Western Plaguelands , start by riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting Liferoot . There is a ton of it here and it should get you to at least level 160 so that you can collect Fadeleaf inland . While going from 160-185 stick near the farms and once you hit 185 you can gather everything in this zone . You 'll reach 225 very quickly being able to gather all the Khadgars Whisker . <p> Western Plaguelands 150-225 <p> Southern Barrens and Feralas is the less ideal route . I would n't recommend doing this route unless you have a flying mount . Start by collecting Kingsblood and Liferoot in the northern part of Southern Barrens . You only need to be level 160 before going to Feralas . <p> Alternative : Southern Barrens 150-160 <p> After Southern Barrens , head south and west to Feralas to collect Khadgars Whiskers and Fadeleaf until level 225 . <p> Alternative : Feralas 185-225 <h> Leveling from 225-300 <p> Once youve trained Herbalism past 225 , you can head to Eastern Plaguelands to level to 275 . Around level 260 Khadgars Whiskers will stop giving you a lot of levels but the Sungrass will suffice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once you 're 275 , head back to town and train Master Herbalism and then fly to the Blasted Lands to reach level 300 . In The Blasted Lands you 'll find plenty of Gromsblood , Dreamfoil and Mountain Silversage . I actually recommend you go to level 315-330 before leaving since herbs are more difficult to find in the Outland . When you 're ready to leave , head into the Dark Portal . <p> The Blasted Lands 275-300 <h> Leveling from 300-360 <p> If you want to make gold with your Herbalism , you should read this guide- to ensure you sell your herbs on the Auction House at the right prices . For this section , collect Felweed , Dreamfoil , and Dreaming Glory in Hellfire Peninsula until you 're level 360 . If you get bored in Hellfire Peninsula you can head into Zangarmarsh as early as level 325 . <h> Leveling from 360-380 <p> To continue leveling Herbalism you 'll need to train Grand Master Herbalism and then head to either the Holwing Fjord or Borean Tundra and start collecting Goldclover and Tiger Lily . Both of these herbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of gold while leveling Herbalism , for more secrets read these tips to making gold . <p> If you head to Borean Tundra , you should collect Goldclover until level 375 , gather any of the Tiger Lily ( requires 375 ) around the lake in the middle of the zone and then head to Sholazar at level 380 . <p> Borean Tundra 360-380 <p> If you decide to go to Howling Fjord , collect Goldclover and Tiger Lily until about level 380 and then head to Sholazar Basin . <p> Howling Fjord 360-380 <h> Leveling from 380-450 <p> At 380 you can head to Sholazar Basin where you can continue picking Tiger Lily and Goldclover until level 400 and then begin picking Adders Tongue . You wo n't find a zone full of this many herbs again , so I recommend you stay here until level 450 but you could technically leave at 425 . <p> Sholazar- Basin 380-450 <h> Leveling from 450-475 <p> The next step is to learn Illustrious Herbalism from your local Herbalism trainer . Then , head to Mount Hjyal and gather Cinderbloom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mount Hyjal 450-475 <h> Leveling from 475-525 <p> Finally , head to Deepholm and collect Cinderbloom and Heartblossom . There are plenty of herbs in Deepholm , but it might be competitive since its one of the most popular places to collect these herbs . You need to be level 82 to go to Deepholm . If you 're not level 82 , you can continue collecting Cinderbloom in Hyjal or Vashjir until you are level 500 . At level 500 , you can go to Uldum and collect Whiptail along the rivers until you 're 525 . <p> Deepholm 475-525 <h> Leveling from 525-600 <p> With the new Mists of Pandaria expansion not much has changed for how you get your skill level up for Herbalism . However , like before you will need to level up your character while collecting herbs . Enjoy the fun filled times of running around MOP collecting herbs ! <p> Jade Forest 525-545 <p> Valley of Four Winds 545-575 <p> Kun-Lai Summit 575-600 <h> Leveling from- 600-700 Warlords of Draenor <p> Warlords of Draenor took all the fun out of leveling Herbalism and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Frostfire Ridge or Shadowmoon Valley . <p> Just wondering when this was last updated because I was farming the Valley of the Four Winds today and noticed that the respawn rate in the Pools of Purity was n't real great . However , I was able to make a nice loop through the Pools , down the river , west to the Brewery , then straight north between the high cliffs and the Headland and then follow the southern edge of that long lake back to the Pools .

This guide covers where to AoE Farm for leather . Keep in mind that this is for Area of Effect farming , that means you will will be killing at least 3 or more things simultaneously . Solo leather farming guides are also available on this site . <h> Where to Farm Light Leather <p> Light Leather is the first leather you will be skinning for and will mostly come from beasts between level 1-25 .

@@30018922 @3718922/ <h> AFK/Mercenary Leveling Guide for Everquest Levels 1-85 <p> This is a guide dedicated to leveling your character automatically while either fully AFK or partially AFK. - Fully AFK means you can walk away and not worry about your characters , partially means that you may have to be present in case something bad happens or to provide buffs but the mercs will do fine leveling on their own . <p> Qualifying areas will have fast respawn times or be an area where you are always fighting at least one enemy with minimal downtime but not so many that you have a high chance of dying . <p> To follow this guide you 'll want to have a max mercenary setup of 3 mercenaries in your group which requires 3 accounts . - You need a tank , healer , and a melee dps. - Do not take caster dps because they will run out of mana easily . - I used Journeyman Rank 1 Mercenaries which require a gold subscription . <p> If you do not have a gold subscription you may or may not be able to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ max how many spawns I aggro I use a triangular formation with each character at the edge of casting range apart in a triangle . - When I do n't  want to max spawns I position my characters differently sometimes right on top of each other . - Pay attention to how far spread out your characters are . - At some times you 'll be able to expand your aggro radius and other times you 'll want to contract it , especially if you 're too low for an area . <h> Breaking In The Camp <p> As you get higher level the camps and enemies will get harder to kill and have an easier time killing you . - Breaking in the camp means slowly killing the enemies as if the Mercenaries were the only ones killing . - The idea is to make sure that you live on the next respawns when you walk away . - If you go into some of these camps , blast down all the mobs , and go afk they will all respawn at the same time leaving your mercs to fight all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - You will wipe in most of the camps later on if you do n't  break them in . <h> Mercenaries <p> At level 65 you will want to consider getting your Journeyman 2 upgrade for your mercenary and J5 at level 75. - You most likely will have a hard time at level 65 doing this but getting your higher tier mercenaries helps a lot . - Pay someone or find a friend to help you that 's higher level if you have to . <p> At these levels if your Mercenary loses confidence on either the tank or healer side , the mobs hit hard enough where they will wipe you almost every time . <h> Levels 1-15 <p> There 's no point in even looking for an afk mercenary camp and its hard to find one because most enemies at this level do n't  auto aggro you which is a requirement for this to work . <h> Levels 15-25 Crescent Reach <p> If you 're going to be assisting your Mercenaries it might be possible to do this camp as early as level 12. - Youll eventually want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you start at 15 that can be rough so do n't  quite get up on top of the hill yet . <p> Things will start turning light blue and blue in your 20s but since you 're afk you might as well just sit here till 25 . <p> This step goes a lot faster if you pull to the hill for your Mercs or roam and kill everything in the area . <h> Levels 25-32 <p> I had a really hard time finding a good camp for these levels but I did find some that will work . - I 'll give you 3 options . - Unrest , Blightfire Moors , and Lake of I 'll Omen and you can choose which youd like . <p> The Estate of Unrest <p> There 's no use in providing a map because I cant get a good enough one for the life of me anyways. - The Unrest Estate is located by going through Butcherblock Mountains to Dagnors Cauldron to Unrest . <p> The camp that you want is in the Basement referred to as the Torture Room . - To get into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor that you can click . - When you click it , it opens up and leads you into the basement . - There is another secret passage down here but the room I want to focus on has 8 mobs that you can afk exp on . <p> To hit all of the respawns park one character in the middle , one up top where the left mob spawns and the other on the far right up top where the other mob spawns in the cubby. - Put your healer merc in the middle . <p> Lake of I 'll Omen <p> The next spot is to the Lake of I 'll Omen . - You want to setup at max Triangular distance in the court yard and you 'll catch quite a few spawns. - If the courtyard is too easy then you want to go up the stairs and inside the castle , find a spot to position all three of your characters so they are in range of each other but you hit the most spawns . <p> Blightfire Moors <p> This is probably going to be the fastest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many spawns you can catch even at max distance . - The Shrooms seem to have a fast respawn time and they also release mini pores that die fast and you get a bit of experience for . <p> Just passed the cave are a bunch of sporali in the field , you can probably see at least 5 out there . - Find a good spot to space out your characters in that field so you hit all of them . - The respawns are pretty quick and some of them spawn bonus sporelings for extra exp . <h> Levels 28-37(40) <p> Blightfire Moors <p> This is a camp near the Stone Hive . - Its near the road that leads to the hive , there will be some trees and several obvious " camps " or spawn points where about 3 eggtenders spawn . - When you arrive here at level 28 you want to stay near the path and only try to afk on one camp , but as you grow stronger you can place each one of your characters in a camp for some decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the wanderers and quick respawns you can get smoked pretty quickly early on . <p> Theoretically you can take this camp to 40 if you leave it afk too long you probably will but some things might turn green . <h> Levels 32-42(45) <p> Blightfire Moors <p> By far one of the best power leveling/afk spots Ive found in the game is at the Undead Tower in the Northwest corner of Blightfire Moors . - There is an area off northeast part of the tower where you can position your characters in a triangle and get 10+ mobs no problem . <p> At level 32 you may want to not spread out as far but you can carry this spot all the way to level 45 if you want , and you should , unless you 're in a hurry . - Otherwise everything is almost always light blue at level 42 . <p> The skeletons here are on about a 2-3 minute respawn timer , making them one of the fastest respawns in the game . <h> Levels 42-52(55) <p> Maidens Eye <p> The idea behind this camp is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hill immediately to your left when you zone in from Dawnshroud peaks . - At the beginning levels you do n't  want to try to man the top of it find an area nearer to the wall that works for you . <p> The ideal goal is to be able to stand in a triangle ontop of this hill where you will get random spawns of 8+. - Its a pretty good afk merc leveling spot but every now and then a super red spawn mob will spawn like a shaman and it can get tough if you have other mobs on you but you can kill him pretty easily if you 're not fighting a bunch at a time . - Its all about timing . <p> Once you control the hill set one of your characters ( tankiest ) into the 5 man spawn marked on the map and you 'll be able to farm mobs nonstop while you level . <p> Theoretically you could take this spot to 55 but at level 52 you probably want to get moving to another spot . <h> Levels 50-60 <p> Crypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone to level in from 50-60. - There are plenty of mobs but somewhat far spaced out so the max we can get with 3 characters on AFK is maybe 7-9. - Exp slows down at these levels as it becomes harder to find close camps but if you 're AFK who cares . <p> You can expect 1-2 levels every 8 hours , the time to go from 50-60 is between 3-5 days . - At this point if you 're around your computer there will be tons and tons of mobs to pull just nearby , you can actually look at all of them from where you setup . - I recommend grabbing a few and pulling them to your merc tank to speed this up . <p> The solid red circles are my preferences , the non solid areas work but you have to be careful in that area so you do n't  accidentally spawn Innoruk , a level 70 raid encounter . <h> Levels 52-60 <p> Akheva Ruins <p> There are probably several camps in here where you can get 7 or more mobs , I like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to get 7+ if you setup properly . <p> Feel free to roam around and find your own camp though this is a good zone to experience in for AFK Merc . <h> Levels 55-60(62) <p> The Bloodfields <p> This is a very very good spot but can also be kind of tough . - Theres a hill in the circle you can sit on that you will get a lot of static / roaming spawns , as many as 15 it seems at some times . - It is very easy to wipe so do n't  just run in here , clear everything , and go afk . <p> Pretend that you are already afk when you come into this camp and let your mercs do most of the work so that after you walk away everything does n't  spawn all at once and wipe your mercs down . <p> You can start out further away from the hill toward the path if you cant handle this hill yet . <h> Levels 57-60(62) <p> The Umbral Plains <p> Be careful in Area 1 for Gantru Dralkenr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not able to take him . - Both these areas pick up wanderers , in one instance I had about 13 on me and nearly died so be careful when breaking in and maintaining these camps . <h> Levels 60-65 <p> Undershore <p> The werewolves are a pretty good camp to afk level but you 'll only get maybe 5-7 if you 're setup and if they all come at once you are going to be hurting so make sure you take the time to break this camp in. - The only thing that makes this a good spot is because of the Hot zone experience bonus , if this was n't the hot zone I 'd probably find another place . <h> Levels 60-67 <p> Torden , Bastion of Thunder <p> At level 60 this camp might be too hard to break in for some people but there 's a pretty good spot in the south where you 'll pick up a few mobs . <p> The trick is to put your guys near the red dots . - Once you clear inside the room leave a character that can take a few hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next room and leave one in the corner to draw those spawns you should be able to get 5-7 with the roamer that walks into the room . <h> Levels 63-68(70) <p> Wall of Slaughter <p> The first spot is sitting in the middle of the field and catching all the mobs as they walk by , this can be a very good spot but you will also pick up named mobs which can cause problems . - This zone is good because its a hot spot . <p> The 2nd spot is more static . - Theres a building full of Dragorn mobs that you can get probably up to 8 if you position your characters correctly . - There is a mob in that that can hit pretty hard and ruin your fun so make sure you take the time to break the camp in . <h> Levels 64-70(72) <p> Plane of Fire <p> I made the mistake of doing this zone during the anniversary so fabled mobs would randomly spawn and beat the crap out of my entire team . <p> How far off the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put yourself out in the center without breaking in the spawns you 're going to be in trouble because you can get up to 15 at a time . <p> Very good spot that you can take higher than 70 if you want and if you got serious balls you can try the 2nd field passed the wall . <h> Levels 70-75(77) <p> Oceangreen Hills <p> There is a zombie camp here with 6 static spawns. - Youll get those and wanderers . - They hit really hard so make sure you use your tank merc to buffer the pull when you break them in and try to kill as slowly as possible during the break in . <p> You 'll sometimes get a named or two to roam across this path as well so if you are around your computer you can get some loot if you check every so often . <h> Levels 75-85 <p> Hills of Shade <p> This might be the final frontier in AFK leveling as the Mercs are getting weaker and the mobs are getting stronger . - It might be possible to level slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be awful since the camps wont allow for more than 15 at a time with maximum spacing . <p> The run to Hills of Shade is long , even with a port , so make sure you bind yourself at the zone in when you come into the tunnel . <p> This camp is mean and you will die , even with a level 100 mercenary on your team , you will die . - I have broken this camp in so many times , watched it for an hour , only to come back in 30 minutes and see everyone dead . <p> Every now and then one runs away and pulls a bunch of random mobs at the right time and the little wisps have an aoe blind/stun which gets kind of annoying , but this is hands down the best camp to go from 75-85. - I 'd try to stay at the previous camp until 77 if you can though . <p> There is an NPC at this camped named " Paul " that almost instantly respawns so you will always be fighting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will want to break in. - When you are in the 70s these are the only 5 mobs you will want to be fighting so stand everyone right on Pauls spawn point . <p> As you go up in levels there are a couple of set of these gnarlers nearby that you can space out and pull 2 and 2 for a total of 9 spawns. - Spacing out even further after this point is dangers no matter what level you are but you can pull wisps and even trees at max distance , the problem is that your champions at the corners of a maximum spread triangle will have to be capable of taking a ton of damage .

Consider your Herbalism level , pretend its 240/300 . Divide it by 5 : level 48 . Subtract about 5 levels and head to a zone of that level ( Tanaris/Feralas is good for levels 40-45 ) and you should have decent luck leveling your Herbalism there , or just use this guides maps . <p> Use your Find Herbs tool while leveling , do this by left clicking on the icon connected to your minimap and going down to Find Herbs : <p> Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you click an herb off in the distance and it will send your character there and have him/her loot on arrival . Very convenient for looting . You can even click to loot an herb while mounted , and you will be auto unmounted on arrival . Finally , make sure you have the Gatherer Addon installed and setup properly before using this guide . <h> Leveling from 1-75 <p> In this guide , I 'll recommend you head to Durotar and then head to North Barrens , South Barrens , Wetlands and then Arathi Highlands till 225 . That path for leveling herbalism is pretty efficient . However , you can head to any of the starting zones like Durotar picking up Silverleaf , Peacebloom , Earthroot and Mageroyal until your herbalism skill is 75 . When writing and testing this guide , it took me less than an hour in Durotar to get to 75 . Do n't  collect more Silverleaf etc while leveling herbalism , if you need extra for leveling Inscription or Alchemy just buy it off the Auction House . If you need more gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once you reach 75 , you need to head back to a trainer to learn Journeyman Herbalism . Then head to northern Barrens ( I kept Westfall routes in this guide as an option ) and run the following route until you 're level 100 , then head to the southern Barrens . Southern Barrens is a great place to level to 150 . Levels 135-150 will be a bit slow , feel free to run around Stonetalon Mountain or eastern Hillsbrad Foothills if you want new scenery . <h> Leveling from 150-170 <p> Head to the Wetlands or Hillsbrad Foothills ( although this guide will have you head to Arathi Highlands next ) and level to 170 by collecting Briarthorn , Kingsblood and Liferoot .

You 'll spend a lot of time there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liferoot and Khadgars Whiskers .

@@30018926 @3718926/ <h> WoW Fishing &amp; Cooking Leveling Guide 1-525 <p> Fishing and Cooking are made for one another , if you do one without the other you 'll be wishing you had n't  later on . As with any profession , Cooking and Fishing can sometimes dig a hole in your pocket . Take a look at this Gold Guide to learn how to sell what you make for the most profit . <p> This Fishing and Cooking Leveling Guide is updated for patch 4.3 and Cataclysm . <p> Fishing and cooking go hand in handcatch fish and cook them , they are perfect for leveling together . Higher level cooking skills require many components derived from fishing . Leveling fishing and cooking it does n't  take a great deal of talent , instead it takes an intense grind consisting of thousands of casts , fish , and flames to cook them over . I 'll send you around to various lakes , trainers , and NPCs who sell recipes for this leveling guide . Basically you 're going to stand around casting thousands of times catching thousands of fish and then frying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 525 with this guide . <h> Why Fish ? <p> Fishing &amp; cooking is one of the more effective ways to make money and lucky for you leveling them is easy with this guide . You can fish while surfing the web , reading a book , or chatting with friends . You can cook those fish into popular raid foods and sell them for quite a bit on your realms Auction House . But this is not the best way to make gold , the best methods are discussed here . You should only try leveling fishing if you really enjoy it , otherwise do n't  waste your time . You can make a ton using these methods . <p> It is important to note these instructions in this guide are just one method of leveling fishing . Fishing can be leveled in all sorts of ways , if you want you can catch fish entirely from the noobie ponds in Ironforge or Orgrimmar . It does not matter where you fish , the chance you level per catch is based on your fishing skill level , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to following the following instructions and leveling where this guide directs you to is to have the necessary fish to level cooking in parallel or to sell valuable fish on the Auction House . <p> You may also find it useful to work towards Achievements while you are leveling your fishing . For example , you might want to try leveling your low level fishing in Ironforge until you catch Old Ironjaw . Although this is the least profitable way to level fishing since you 'll vendor everything you catch . And it might take until level 525 to actually catch Old Ironjaw ( I caught him around level 280 ) . <h> Lures <p> In order to catch the best fish you should always use a lure to maximize the number of fish you can reel in . If you cant afford them you can go without or find nightcrawlers to use instead . These will effectively decrease the amount of casts you 'll make to catch each fish and will make leveling your fishing a lot easier . <p> Fishing and Cooking Guide ( Levels 1-225 ) <p> Fishing ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fishing ( Levels 325-450 ) and Cooking Guide ( Levels 300-450 ) <p> Fishing ( Levels 450-525 ) and Cooking Guide ( Levels 450-525 ) <h> Fishing and Cooking Leveling Guide 1-525 <h> Stuff Youll Need for Leveling with this Guide <p> Recipes Youll Need to Buy for 1-450 <p> Recipe <p> Vendor for Horde <p> Vendor for Alliance <p> Recipe : Brilliant Smallfish <p> Harn Longcast in Bloodhoof Village , Mulgore <p> Tharynn Bouden in Goldshire , Elwynn Forest <p> Recipe : Longjaw Mud Snapper <p> Harn Longcast in Bloodhoof Village , Mulgore <p> Tharynn Bouden in Goldshire , Elwynn Forest <p> Recipe : Bristle Whisker Catfish <p> Naal Mistrunner in Thunderbluff <p> Catherine Leland in Canals , Stormwind <p> Recipe : Mithril Head Trout <p> Kelsey Yance in Booty Bay , The Cape of Stranglethorn <p> Kelsey Yance in Booty Bay , The Cape of Stranglethorn <p> Recipe : Filet of Redgill <p> Kelsey Yance in Booty Bay , The Cape of Stranglethorn <p> Kelsey Yance in Booty Bay , The Cape of Stranglethorn <p> Recipe : Baked Salmon <p> Sheendra Tallgrass in Camp Mojache , Feralas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feltail Delight <p> Zurai in Swamprat Post , Zangarmarsh <p> Doba in Orebor Harborage , Zangarmarsh ( neutral faction required ) <p> Recipe : Blackened Trout <p> Gambarinka in Zabrajin , Zangarmarsh <p> Doba in Orebor Harborage , Zangarmarsh ( neutral faction required ) <p> Recipe : Blackened Sporefish <p> Juno Dufrain in Cenarion Refuge , Zangarmarsh <p> Juno Dufrain in Cenarion Refuge , Zangarmarsh <p> Recipe : Imperial Manta Steak <p> Misensi in Dalaran <p> Derek Odds in Dalaran <p> Recipe : Lightly Fried Lurker or Lurker Lunch <p> Shazdar-Orgrimmar <p> Bario Matalli-Stormwind <p> Recipe : Pickled Guppy <p> Shazdar-Orgrimmar <p> Bario Matalli-Stormwind <p> Recipe : Delicious Sagefish Tail or Severed Sagefish Head <p> Shazdar-Orgrimmar <p> Bario Matalli-Stormwind <h> Fishing and Cooking ( Levels 1-225 ) <p> For this section be sure to have the recipes for Brilliant Smallfish , Longjaw Mud Snapper , Bristle Whisker Catfish , and Mithril Head Trout .

whatever gear I had at the moment . - I picked up a nice 2hander so I switched to that and moved my mouse skills to sweep attack and slash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time because there was n't really any scenarios I ran into that required Iron Skin . <p> However , I ended up going with Slash and Shield Bash , the charge from Shield Bash is very mobile and you do plenty enough damage . - When I got level 10 I put rune of electrify on Slash and it was way too easy to beat the Skeleton King . - Also at level 10 you can use a passive skill to equip a 2handed in your main hand so there 's no reason to go without a shield again . <h> Skeleton King Fight on Normal <h> Levels 10-16 <p> Lots of new abilities and skills through this phase . - There is n't much of a problem no matter what you choose , not even the butcher fight is that hard in Act 1 . <p> I used Heavenly Strength for a bit because I found a 2hander that was good but then I ended up finding a 1 hander even better so my passive skill became Righteousness . <p> Smite with Shatter Rune became my primary attack . - I swapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Paladins in Diablo 2 , very good for ranged and fights that require fighting . - When I needed mobility I used Shield Bash with Shattered Shield for The Butcher Fight . <p> Shield Glare is still useful , I switched to Consecration but rarely used it . - I used Iron Skin with Reflective Skin rune for the Butcher fight but it was way over kill . <p> Steed Charge I kept up when I got it just to get into the center of fights and AoE but I used Provoke with cleanse for the Butcher . - And of course Laws of Valor which is just an aura/buff . <h> Queen Araneae on Normal <h> The Warden on Normal <h> The Butcher on Normal <h> Act 2 Normal <h> Levels 16-21 <p> My skills were pretty much the same till about level 20 , Smite , Blessed Hammer , and at level 18 I put Shield Glare on with Uncertainty . - At level 20 things get really insane . <p> You will have something called Falling Sword which let 's you drop from the sky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things caused a ton of damage that it seemed over powered . <p> So at level 21 my current setup is Smite with Shatter , Blessed Shield , Shield Glare with Uncertainty , Condemn , Laws of Valor with Invincible , and Falling Sword . - My passive abilities are Righteousness and Vigilant . - I 've only fought Maghda which was a joke . <p> You get another passive skill and some other conviction spells but I really enjoy the mobility of Steed and Falling Sword , I use them to just get around the map quicker when not fighting . <p> Even on the final fight I did n't  have to change any skills out and it was easy . - Blessing Shield from a distance while dodging Belials attacks and just smack him otherwise . - The steed and the jump actually help if you need to get out of an area quick . <h> Zulton Kulle on Normal <h> Belial on Normal <h> Act 3 Normal <h> Levels 25-30 <p> At level 26 I switched to Fist of Heavens from Blessing Shield . <p> At level 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level 30 I added Wraithful to third passive skill . <p> Everything else remains the same and no issues so far , fought Ghom and Siegebreaker Assault Beast . <h> Grom Fight on Normal <h> Siegebreaker Assault Beast <h> Cydaea Fight on Normal <h> Azmodan Fight on Normal <h> Act 4 Normal <h> - Levels 30-32 <p> Level 31 changed to Justice with Crack Rune and at level 32 I added divine well rune to Fist of Heavens . - Had no issues with any of the bosses with these skills , not even Diablo . <h> Iskatu Fight <h> Rakanoth Fight <h> Izual Fight <h> Diablo Fight <h> Act 5 Normal <h> Levels 32-35 <p> Exact same skills work fine , swapped Blessed Hammer with Rune of Limitless in at level 35 . <h> Urzael Fight on Normal <h> Levels 35-38 <p> At level 36 I put Rune of Rejuvenation on Steed Charge , this comes in handy when you 're about to die you can run around and regen health , especially during boss fights . At 37 I moved back to Smite with Rune of Surge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Everything stayed the same and there were no issues <h> Adria Fight on Normal <h> Malthael Fight on Normal <h> Adventure Mode Levels 38-70 <p> Its time for adventure mode . - You can start adventure mode at anytime on any character as long as one of your characters has completed all 5 acts . - But this guide assumes you are a new player making a crusader , otherwise , you can follow the guide below from level 1 to 70 . <p> The idea behind adventure mode is to increase the difficulty to the maximum you can handle because it gives you bonus experience , gold , and on the hardest levels you can get items and other things . <p> If you 've been following my guide then you want to start out on at least Expert , Master preferred , if you can do higher , then do higher . - The way to tell which difficulty is best for you is to first see if you 're dying too quickly and secondly how fast you are killing . - Some of you may survive in Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you fight the Butcher and the fight takes 30 minutes , its time to tone it down a level until you get better gear / skills . <h> Selecting Adventure Mode <h> Changing Difficulty <h> Bounties on Map <p> The bounties are somewhat random and will change everytime you leave / create a new game . - You do not have to complete all 5 , you can complete 1 and log off . - You just want the shard from completing the bounty so you can open a rift . <h> Travelling Between Acts <p> You can go anywhere at anytime with just the click of a button , to swap acts make sure your map level is zoomed out to the furthest setting then click on the act you wish to go to . <h> Act 1 <h> Levels 38-45 <p> To make the leveling process easy and to switch things up as we level I like to start in Act 1 . - Well do all 5 bounties and then open a rift . - I usually play on Master difficulty to level but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - My Butcher fight was over 7 minutes . <p> If you play on a lesser difficulty just repeat act 1 a couple times or farm a bit more . <p> I swapped to rune of Critical for Laws of Valor to get a crit boost on some fights . - Everything else worked out alright . <p> I recommend switching to single target skills and runes on your left click and a better right click then Blessed Hammer . - Perhaps Punish with Celerity on your left click and Blessed Shield with Divine Aegis Rune for boss fights . <h> Act 2 <h> - Levels 45-48 <p> A couple changes here with skills , level 47 I changed to Condemn with Shattering Explosion . - The steed was awesome but I needed more AoE damage to deal with the bounty hunting . - I also switched my rune on Blessed Hammer to Icebound Hammer at level 48 which gave me more crowd control . <h> Act 3 <h> Levels 48-51 <p> No changes , just do bounties and open rifts in Act 3 . <h> Act 4 <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will start to pick up and youll start to do a lot more damage which should help you gain experience faster . - You can sit in Act 4 do 5 bounties and run the Rift , you should be pretty close 55 but you can re run a few for fun if you 're not . <h> Act 5 <h> Levels 55-60 <p> You may have to run it all twice but definitely worth it . - At this point its a good idea to look at spending your bloodshards from your rift runs on a weapon to increase your damage . - Then take a look at all your other gear , if all of your gear is n't 55+ you may want to buy some random items with bloodshards and see if you can get an upgrade . <p> At level 60 your 1h weapon should be about 750 base damage or if you 're using a 2h with the passive to hold it in one hand , you should want something about 1000 base damage at the least . <h> Levels 60-70 Torment Mode <p> For this part if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode , some of you wont be able to do it on torment mode yet so I recommend that you move to at least Master if you are n't  until it gets too easy . <p> The strategy for these levels is to complete all 5 bounties in one sitting so you get the bonus exp and then clear the rifts with your fragments . <p> I like to start in Act 1 and work my way to Act 5 again doing 5 bounties and a rift in each one but you can pretty much pick and choose what you want . <h> Skill Changes : <h> Level 62 <p> I changed out Falling Sword with Heavens Fury with Rune of Fires of Heaven . - The reason I did this was because when I activate Laws of Valor Critical I can literally shoot a beem that crits for over a million at level 60 with my current setup and it gets higher . - I felt the need for more single target damage for the long boss fights . <p> Even though I made this change Falling Sword saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight one too many times . - You have to really find something you 're comfortable with as you progress further into Torment you 'll need more survivability and escape abilities . <h> Level 65 <p> At level 65 its almost an absolute must to get a good 1h weapon . - I had the convienience somehow of getting 2 1h legendaries around 1750dps each . - The reason you need a 1h weapon is so you can free up a passive skill because at level 65 we get the passive skill of Blunt which increases both Blessed Hammer and Justice damage by 20% , giving us a huge boost that we are going to need . <p> With that passive change I also swapped my rune to Limitless for Blessed hammer and I moved to Justice with Rune of Burst on my left click . - This is a major damage enhancer . <h> Level 65+ Gearing Recommendations <p> At level 65 its time to get absolutely serious and pay more attention to what you 're equipping. - Blizzard has installed easy to read stat comparisons for us : Damage , Toughness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take any upgrade that gave you a damage boost , however , damage is n't going to keep us alive so we need healing and toughness. - I put together this general formula for deciding what gear to get rid of and keep . <p> 1% Damage = 3% Toughness = 6% Healing <p> So what does that formula mean ? <p> If you 're looking at equipping a new piece of armor and it gives you a 3% damage increase at the cost of 15% toughness , then by my formula its not an upgrade because 3% damage is equivalent to only 9% toughness. - If you are losing more than 9% toughness its simply not an upgrade in this scenario . <p> Other things to consider are the active skills you are using and ehancements to those skills . - Lots of items will increase the damage of your skills . - So equipping an item that has 12% Blessed Hammer damage is better than an item that grants 12% Fist of Heavens damage because we do n't  use Fists of Heavens . <p> At 70 and heading into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enchanting . 
@@30018928 @3718928/ <h> Everquest Beginners Guide Returning Players <p> This guide is written for players returning to game after a long absence or new players to the game that have some MMO experience . MMO experience might be necessary because I tell you to skip the tutorial . I wrote this after returning back to Everquest after 10 years of break . The game was so unfamiliar and somewhat changed that I had no idea what was going on and got mad a few times . <p> The Tutorial <p> First up is this god awful tutorial . Sure it can help you learn things about the game but by the time you make it through this you wo n't even want to play the game anymore . Make sure that when you make a new character that the Tutorial Button is n't pressed . It was on by default for me and I thought it was mandatory so I actually quit the game for a few months before I came back again because the tutorial was so much crap . <p> Getting Platinum <p> If you 're serious about getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of platinum pretty quickly ( as much as 400k ) by spending $18 on a Krono . A Krono is a 30 day in-game gold subscription item that you can trade and sell . Lots of players buy these to keep their monthly subscription going . I sold 4 to start and bought myself a Blade of Carnage for fun , still have n't found a use for it however . <p> Using the Bazaar <p> Make sure your account has at least Rain of Fear enabled , which is the 19th of 20th expansion at the time of writing . Having Rain of Fear let 's you sit by a Parcel Merchant , scan the bazaar by typing /bazaar , and instantly buying/shipping the gear to that Parcel Merchant . <p> It may seem small but with all the gear you 're going to need leveling a new character , it saves a ton of time rather than running around in the Bazaar to each trader . You can search , buy all your items , and get them from the Parcel Merchant , similar to WoW Mailbox feature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small bank that I sit at and buy all my gear . - His name is Caden Zharik and he s outside the building just up the steps . <p> Getting Gear <p> Back in the day it was hard to level because we had no gear . - So what I would do is kill stuff in Umbral Plains and run my level 1 out to loot it . - I would also put " twink " items on my characters which I already made a list of . - I still put some twink items on my characters like a Fungi Tunic etc , but its all for show now . <p> In Secrets of Faydwer they introduced Defiant gear . - Defiant gear is gear for every class/race combo that drops around the world and sells cheaply in the auction house . - You can get this gear at level 10 and the stats are so good that you 'll have an easy time leveling . <p> Here are all the tiers of Defiant Gear . - What I recommend is only coming back to the Bazaar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear . - Defiant gear will last you until level 80 and then you 'll be able to figure it out after . <p> They added Mercenaries to the game to help you level up early on because you cant find groups anywhere in early levels . - I started off 2 boxing but now I 'm 3 boxing , I play a **26;335;TOOLONG . <p> The best recommended setup for my mercs that I read is to have a Caster DPS/Tank/Healer . <p> Well here 's the problem with my setup and that setup . - Early on its just horrible . - For the rate that I like to level at both my caster dps , and my wizard are constantly out of mana. - My SK is my main . - Not only does he not do any damage , but he ca n't tank as good as the Mercenary , but the Mercenary does n't  do damage either . <p> What Ive been running then is a Healer/2 Melee DPS. - The Melee DPS are necessary because my casters are always out of Mana. - My SK tanks , healer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wizard / Shaman . - I thought about adding in an enchanter or bard so I 'd have mana , maybe that setup works best . <p> So when you pick your Merc , if you do n't  do any damage , do n't  get a tank or healer merc for yourself , especially if you 're solo . - Do n't  get a caster either . - Get yourself a Melee DPS and keep him healed or assist him . - The melee DPS at early levels is tanking as good as my SK is and I fully twinked my SK out with a Reaver , Fungy Tunic , and a ton of old world items , probably put 500k into him . <p> There 's no one size fit all merc combination . - I 've changed my mercs out several times now and I will probably end up with a Merc Tank/Healer/Caster DPS , but I do n't  need that setup yet . <p> And yes , there is a huge difference between a J1 and A5 Mercenary . - My J1 Tank was out damaging my A5 Melee Merc. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leveling <p> Do n't  bother going back to Old World Zones , the experience is n't worth it . - And do n't  bother going to Hot Zones just because they are Hot , a lot of them are terrible for experience . - I 've been using Almars Leveling Guide- and it works fine . - He has a lot of paths and alternate paths , even platinum farming / leveling guides . <p> here 's his recommendation for leveling quickly . - It was designed for Free to Play so if you 're a gold member with a better Merc this should be way easy for you . <p> If you want to use your old character , go ahead . - But if you want to start over , you 're not really that far behind your old character unless you have an 85+ character . <p> You can now opt in to receive " Free AAs " as you level up to 85. - At level 85 you 'll have about 4000 AA. - Do n't  think that your gear is good either . - I had full raid gear on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I logged in , I was able to upgrade a lot of my items cheaply in the Bazaar . <p> So unless you have some unique rare drop , a cool item , or a cool name . - Do n't  be afraid to start over , you can catch up to any level 85 within a month both gear and AA wise .

You can take this Timber and start a work order at your Lumber Mill , when finished you 'll get Garrison Resources . - You need to make sure that you always have an active work order going at your lumber mill , take time to cut down trees that you can , it does n't  take very long at all . <p> At level 98 or when you have a Spires of Arak Outpost you 'll be able to upgrade your Lumber Mill to level 2 , this will allow you to harvest Medium Trees , upgrade this as soon as possible . <p> Also make sure to complete any lumber mill related quests you get along the way , there will be a few you encounter as you 're cutting down trees . <p> You could also go with a Trading Post . - A Trading Post will take random resources ( changes daily ) in exchange for Garrison Resources . - It works in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a random resource . - I did n't  like this option because on some days I did n't  have that specific resource so I 'd have to go buy it from the auction house or farm it stick with the Lumber Mill its easy . <p> You gain 20 resources per work order which results in about 120 per day if you keep your work orders active . <h> Questing <p> There are a lot of quests that provide Garrison Resources as a reward . - Click Here for a complete list of Garrison Resources Quests. - There are 3 really notable quests that happen in the Spires of Arak that are optional to the story lines but you need to do them anyway because they offer 100 Garrison Resources for each one . - All you have to do is go kill an enemy , loot it , and turn it in for a reward . <p> It says group required but honestly I soloed them all with my hunter at level 98ish but you can get help if you need it normally there 's a lot of people walking around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other quests with lesser Garrison Rewards . - Anytime you 're told to kill something that 's elite or might take a group , that 's a sign that there could be some serious Garrison Resources involved . <h> Garrison Missions / Followers <p> The biggest mistake people make is not realizing that each follower mission you do consumes Garrison Resources . - So if you 're the type of person to just run to your Command Table and send everyone out on a mission you 're going to be depleting resources fast . - For example , at level 100 I have 22 missions available to me. - If I just did all of them that would cost me at least 220 Garrison Resources which is a lot . <p> So what were looking for here is doing mostly Garrison Missions that reward Garrison Resources . - In the mean time you should focus on doing Bonus Experience or Experience missions in order to PREPARE your followers to do missions that give you Garrison Resources . <p> Do n't  do any Gold Reward missions , the gold is n't nearly enough to make it worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what to do with it . - If you really want to focus on leveling followers and generating Garrison Resources through followers then you 'll want to put a Barracks in. - A Barracks let 's you have more followers , gives you special patrol missions , and let 's you level them faster . <p> However , if you are n't  going to be focusing on your followers then you 'll want to have a War Mill in place for upgrades so you can start running heroics sooner or right at level 100 . <h> Rare Spawns / Treasures <p> For those of you that really want to get out and get some Garrison Resources there are many many treasures and rare spawns across the world of Draenor that give you Garrison Resources . - Anytime you 're travelling and see a Skull on your map you definitely want to check it out and kill it if you can . <p> You can find an addon to find the rare treasures or a map at a place like Wowhead , here is an example map at Wowhead for Rares/ Treasures in Nagrand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could follow this type of map for each zone . <p> After you 've completed all of the quest story lines in the zone you can fly to Warspear or Stormshield and purchase a Treasure map for that zone from the Archaeology Fragments vendor . <p> It will take some time to kill all the rares and farm all the treasures but you can earn a massive amount of Garrison Resources . - I recommend doing as many as you can as you are leveling in that zone . <p> Use the links to the maps below for the zone you 're working in. - You can also see in the complete lists which ones give Garrison Resources . <h> Random Heroic of the Day <p> If for some reason you do n't  want to do some of the stuff above you can get 50 Garrison Resources a day for completing the daily heroic . - You can also get Garrison Resources for participating in PvP and earning some of the achievements , but with a Lumber Mill and farming rares / treasures you should be able to upgrade to Garrison Level 3 right at level 100.

I would spend the extra time to get as much ancient mana as possible to start because this world quest only comes every few days . <p> As you progress through the scenario you 'll start to get chests and other things that make your withered army more powerful . <p> When I first started doing this I freaked out trying to open every door and get every chest I could . - Every time you get a chest or fight a hard boss behind a locked door you run the risk of depleting your army , and as you deplete your army your progression slows down and you 'll eventually fail . <p> I want to point out that all of the big chests you see in the scenario that require 5-10 withered are permanent one time loot chests ( so it seems ) as I started bringing them back as fast as I could I began to notice that they no longer appeared anymore . <p> Do not be dumb and rush into getting all of these chests , what I would do is make sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoid as many bosses and locked doors as possible . <p> Set a target to get one 5 or 10 withered chest per run until you get them all do n't  go all out like I did and waste your entire army on chests . <p> Make sure you knock out every cacooned object because although most of the time these will be enemies in them , sometimes you ll find a withered exile you can recruit into your army . These possible recruits are also found in most of the boss rooms and behind other concealed doors , but be warned , at the start even though you can beat a boss and gained 3-4 withered from these rooms , the chances are the boss will weaken or kill more than that until your withered get upgrades from chests . <p> Eventually you 'll be able to clear this level with 30-40 withered at the end and it wont be any challenge at all .

@@30018955 @3718955/ <h> Blizzard Confirms New Anti-Botting Software Set to Run in Future <p> Blizzard announced a smart software that could render World of Warcraft bots useless . Instead of investigating player reports or monitoring logs to catch botters ; Blizzard has decided to take a new approach to botting in World of Warcraft . <p> Over the years botting has become a serious problem for Blizzard resulting in massive support tickets and lots of subscriber cancellations . As of today the majority of their employees are now GMs or work in the support department . <p> The culprit ? <p> Botters of course . Blizzard receives millions of tickets each month reporting botters in battlegrounds , raids , groups , and just randomly running around in the world farming . <p> Botters ruin raids and groups by causing unnecessary wipes or just plain standing there doing nothing . At least 1 in every 4 players to enter a battleground is played by a bot . The auction house and market are flooded with items from botters . It does n't end there . <p> Blizzard is n't exactly innocent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World of Warcraft was released was to create more time sinks . Blizzard noticed that once characters reached a max level in the original release there was nothing left for them to do so they would stop playing and eventually cancel their account after making several alts . <p> To keep more people paying for a subscription , Blizzard introduced the Isle of Quel'danas in their first expansion , The Burning Crusade . The isle was a daily quest hub where players would have to login and spend 1-2 hours each day for nearly a month to max out reputation in order to receive epic items . <p> It did n't stop there , the theme of the game is now rooted in daily quests , reputation farms , honor farming , and valor points farming . Everything you want to do in World of Warcraft , especially at max level , is a time sink now . A time sink that requires you to do the same unchallenging thing over and over again until your eyes bleed . <p> It 's their fault really for making people farm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No new content to explore , no dynamic game play just the same old boring crap . The same boring crap that makes you want to re-examine your life and ask yourself why upi even play at all . <p> Even though Blizzard is the one responsible for the boom in botting software , they have started losing customers because of botting . <p> The details of Blizzards new bot detection and prevention software are not solid yet but here is a brief idea of what to expect . <h> Maximum items/gold farmed based on level per character <p> That 's right , just like you can only carry so much gold with you when you transfer servers , you will only be able to farm so many of the same item/gold per character . <p> Blizzard will calculate approximately double the ingredients/materials required for quests/professions and set that as your character cap by level . If a profession or recipe requires a certain level , you wo n't be able to obtain it . <p> Let 's say that you 're a 600 miner but you have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at farming something like 100 of every ore each week or day . Once you have mined to that cap , you will no longer be able to mine anymore that day or week until reset ( similar to raid and instance resets ) <p> Let 's say that you are a 600 miner and you 're leveling Blacksmithing from 500-600 and you need about 3,000 Ghost Iron Ore to get there . Blizzard has a cap on your account for Blacksmithing and will only allow you to farm a total of 6000 Ghost Iron Ore for the lifetime of your account with higher daily caps so it ca n't all be farmed at once . When you read that limit you will be placed back into the regular daily ore limit cap again . <p> The theme here is that if you have no need for the item you are farming because you have no profession or quest , then you will be restricted in farming those items each week . If you have a need you will be restricted by a lifetime balance factor . <p> Level comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain quests and/or recipes , meaning no matter how high your mining is , unless you are eligible for a recipe you can not farm the item to make that recipe . <p> This allows regular players to complete their professions and farm a bit extra for gold . It does not allow any player , legitimate or bot , to farm any excess of minerals or items . Farmers that are n't bots are just as bad as bots , most are paid 4 cents an hour and work out of China . <p> Blizzard will also be doing away with auction house mules by restricting the maximum quantity any one character can have on them at one time and the lower level that character is , the lower that cap will be . This goes for gold too which will have a new cap of around 100k per character depending on level . <p> Veteran accounts , those accounts that have a long payment history , creation date , and are in good standing will receive bonuses to these limits allowing them to go above and beyond some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own to prevent farming . This will be a reward to players that have stuck around for awhile and shown they are not bots . <h> Automatic player suspensions to players that repeat actions <p> This part of the software addresses bots that farm dungeons , raids , and battlegrounds . Blizzard went down the right path by making weekly caps , now they will go one step further . <p> Daily caps with a maximum repeat action of 3 . <p> With this no player would be able to run the same raid , dungeon , or battleground more than 3 times a day . There would also be a cap each day for maximum dungeons , battlegrounds , and raids which could be something like 7 dungeons/battlegrounds , and 2 raids . <p> This prevents people from putting on a bot and farming to their maximum pvp and pve points in a single sitting to reach their weekly cap . <p> out of 10 horde players , 5 are afk <p> It prevents players and bots from farming many old world raids and dungeons and selling those items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these daily caps then what it plans to implement is making every item beyond these caps no-trade or making players ineligible for rewards . <p> Let 's say that you are farming a low level dungeon like Scarlet Monastery for cloth and gear to sell . After 7 dungeon runs , everything you loot after would be labeled no-sell/no-drop so that you ca n't sell it to a vendor or trade it to another player . This would allow players farming materials for themselves to still use the items they loot , however , it prevents them from selling these items for money . <p> Blizzard frowns upon both legitimate farmers and bots . Spending all day in game farming items to sell to everyone else is not what they had envisioned . <p> No one knows when this will be implemented because it wo n't be announced in any patch notes , it will just be something that is live one day without anyone knowing . <p> But it is coming , and there 's nothing bots or even the team over at Stealth Botters can do about it . 
@@30018956 @3718956/ <h> LoL Gold Farming Guide How To Farm The Most Gold <h> Gold Values <p> Gold or gp ( gamer points ) is the main currency in the League of Legends . It is what you use to buy all of your items to help you excel in game . If you want to become really good at the game , you need to learn the value of gold in game and get as much of it as possible . <h> Last Hitting <p> It is crucial that you as a player learn to last hit against minions , this is the main source of income in the game . If you hit a minion with a shot that kills it , it is a last hit . Acquiring this last hit will reward your champion with gold . The more gold your champion can obtain , the more items your champion will be able to purchase , the more gold your champion gets , the more " fed " you will be . <h> Laning <p> In every wave of minions that arrive in your lane there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be an extra siege minion in every 3rd wave that is worth extra gold . Each wave spawns at the nexus tower every 30 seconds , so a new wave will hit your lane in that time . The gold ratios will vary throughout the game , here is a chart to help sort out just how much minions are worth . <p> Caster Minions- 16 gold to start , going up by 1 after the 2nd wave , worth +1 gold every 10 waves <p> Siege Minions- 27 gold to start , going up by 1 after the 2nd wave , worth +1 gold every 10 waves <p> 10 waves = 5 minutes . ( every 5 minutes they are worth 1 more gold ) <p> If you worked on last hitting and last hit every minion , you could potentially earn 227 gold per minute or 255 gold per minute if a siege minion was in one of the waves . Last hitting every minion in every wave is very difficult , so it will take a lot of work and practice . <p> Last hitting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players because they are all about getting the kills . What they do n't  understand is that you can get even more fed just by farming and avoiding the thrill of the chase that we all fall prey to eventually . <h> Zoning <p> Zoning out an enemy champion means that you are denying them farm because they are too scared to farm in range of you , or they are really low health and are afraid to get engaged on . If you get someone really low , instead of turret diving at level 2 for a kill , work on zoning them out and getting last hits and keeping them from getting last hits . Essentially , all the farm that you are denying them is an advantage for you . If they get sick of being zoned out and want to go back to base to heal , you need to punish that decision . The instant they " b " back to base , you need to push the lane as hard as you can and drive all of your waves straight into their tower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to capitalize on it . <p> People mistake the term getting " fed " for only getting a lot of kills . Kills are worth it if they do n't  take you away from farm that you could be missing . You need to be able to contain that killer instinct and get every last hit , so you can buy all the amazing items under the damage category at the store , and go Rambo on the whole team in the late game . <h> Getting Fed <p> Understanding the term " getting fed " will help you out immensely in game , and it will help you contain yourself so you do n't  end up giving the enemy that early first blood . You need to understand this game is meant to take a while , you wo n't get all the gold you need within the first 20 minutes . You need to work at it . Every single creep kill you get adds to your total gold . If you are only hunting champs to try and get gold and get rich quick , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is worth 400 gp ) getting a kill is n't anything to go crazy about unless the kill is laid out right in front of you . getting a kill will give you 150 gold , more if they were on a kill streak , and less if they have been constantly feeding . If you put all of your effort into farming the current lane instead of getting the kill , you could make all that gold up in farm . What 's even better , if you got the enemy extremely low and they are just too stubborn to leave their lane , you can effectively zone them out . <p> If you watch pro games , most of the time ( apart from a successful early gank ) First Blood does n't  come out until 10-15 minutes in the game . The pros understand how important farming is to help them build into the late game beasts they are getting paid to be . If you want to play like a pro , play for the farm . <h> Support and Jungler <p> The support and Jungler do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see a steady flow of coin going into their pocket , they rely heavily on global objectives . To help get your support and Jungler fed , your team needs to communicate and create strategies around securing objectives such as Dragon , Baron , and Turret/Inhibitor kills . Its also the Jungler and Supports job to keep track of when the global objectives come back up . They need to alert the team that its almost time for dragon so everyone can group up to secure the global gold for everyone . <p> Here are some comparisons on how much global objectives can help your team <p> Turret/Inhibitor = 150 gp for everyone on the team . That 's equal to a champion kill for each person on your team . <p> Dragon = 190 gp for everyone on the team . That 's equal to a champion kill for each person on your team plus some change . <p> Never let kill/death ratio ruin the spirits of your team . If you fall behind early , you need to be aware . Instead of seeking revenge on the lucky noob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get dragon for everyone . Not only are you canceling out the kill that noob had , but you are giving your team the upper hand in gold . <h> Fighting Minions Under Your Tower <p> If you are caught in a situation where your lane opponent has pushed you all the way up to your tower and your jungler is n't around to help get him away , here are some tips to help you farm under the tower . <p> Melee Minions : - Take 2 tower hits at full health and are left with enough health to kill with 1 Auto Attack . <p> Caster Minions : - To kill caster minions under tower , you need to hit it at full health with one Auto Attack , let the tower hit it , and it will leave it with enough health that you can finish it with one more Auto Attack . <p> Siege Minions : - I do n't  know the exact amount of turret hits it takes , but as it starts to get low , get an ability ready to finish it off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minion . <p> It takes time and lots of practice to get this mechanic down , but its better to practice it knowing what is actually going on instead of raging at your tower for trying to steal all your CS . With hard work and mild frustration , last hitting under a tower will become second nature . <h> Tips and tricks for getting gold : <p> Avoid using abilities for farming , if you spam your abilities to get farm , you will go OOM ( Out of Mana ) quickly and need to return to base , which will ultimately lead to you missing out on good farm. - <p> It is worth it to secure a Siege Minion kill with an ability because these minions are worth the most gold . <p> Whatever lane you are in , when your jungler tells you to meet at dragon or baron in a minute , push your lane up to the enemy tower before you go to dragon , this will secure safety for your tower as well as denying your lane opponent farm . <p> If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a team fight and you are pushing out a lane , spam all of your abilities to kill all the minions before your minions have a chance to hit the enemy minions <p> If you exchanged for a 3 for 0 fight , and you have all your allies , check to see if dragon is up and take it quickly while the enemy team is on their death timers , if dragon is down , group up to take down a tower or push out lanes .

@@30018957 @3718957/ <h> Summoners Rift Jungle Guide and Routes <p> Welcome to the Summoners Rift Jungle Guide . <p> For those of you who are new to Jungling I want to tell you that not every champion has the ability to jungle and if you take them to the jungle you may die or find it extremely challenging . - I also have to warn you that the lower level your summoner profile the less access to runes and masteries you will have . - This will make it impossible for you to jungle with some champions and harder with others . - The higher level you are on your summoner profile the easier time you 'll have at the start of jungling because of these runes and masteries . <p> Not being able to cruise through the jungle at start will get you behind in levels which is not good and could cause your team to get pissed off or blame you for a loss which does n't  put you in a position to make any friends . <p> It is absolutely vital that as a jungler you use the summoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but smite is essentially a requirement . - You may also want to start off in the Jungle with a Hunters Machete to increase damage to minions . <p> If you want to jungle at low level and find that the champion you 're taking through the Jungle dies or cant do it at level 1 without a lot of help or a lot of wasted health potions I recommend you go to the top lane to about level 3 or 4 and go back into the Jungle after that point . <p> The point of jungling is to provide your team with ganks and allow your top lane champion to get solo experience and farm in the top lane which helps later in game . <p> Below is a list of the most common champions that are considered Junglers , any other champions take through the Jungle at your own risk . - Keep in mind these are champions whose primary role is considered jungler. - Champions like Master Yi are excellent at jungling but are not in this list because he s considered better in the Middle Lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at jungling but is n't in the list then ignore the list . - This list is for beginner junglers . <h> Jungling Route if You Have Mana <p> If you have any mana and your abilities use mana then you always want to start at the Blue Buff from the Ancient Golem. - The Blue Buff provides cooldown reduction and mana regeneration . <p> Below you 'll find the sequence for both top and bottom starts . - If you start at bottom stay in the bottom jungle and if you start at top follow the top route . <p> After you get to the 5th spot then you will go back to the wolves ( 2 ) and then to the Wraiths ( 3 ) and from there you can go wherever you want . - Keep in mind the Ancient Golem and Lizards are on a longer spawn timer than the rest . <h> Jungling Route if You Do n't  Have Mana <p> If you have no mana or do n't  rely on mana to clear the jungle through abilities then you want to start at the Red Buff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over time . <p> Below is the map for both top and bottom starts . <p> After you clear the Ancient Golem you 'll go to the Wraiths ( 3 ) and to the Big Golem ( 2 ) . - The rest is at your discretion . <h> Jungling Route if There Is No Other Jungler <p> If the enemy team has no other jungler than you want to run this route . - Start at the buff of your choice on your side depending on whether or not you have mana and run a route that clears all 4 of the buffs on both sides . - This prevents the enemies from getting the buff and makes sure you always have both buffs on you . <p> When you go to the opposing jungle you have to be careful running between turrets when you go across the middle lane . <p> Also at the start you may want to clear a set of wolves or wraiths until your smite is off cooldown. - Once you can clear <h> Jungling Route to Piss Off The Other Jungler <p> The primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other jungle only at the start just to slow the other jungler down . - To do this you need to determine where you think the other jungler will start . <p> The other jungler will most likely have Smite . - Once you find the champion who has smite on the loading screen you need to know whether or not this champion uses mana or not . - Most of the time the jungler will start at the blue buff because they need mana . <p> If you determine this is the case for the enemy jungler then go right to his red buff at start and clear that camp then continue back to clear your jungle out . - If they are going to go for red then go start at their blue . <p> Keep in mind that you need to know that your jungler can kill the big camps with no help otherwise this wo n't work . <p> Also be warned that some enemy teams will ward and prepare for this invasion and be waiting for you . - This risk is on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambush.

Most people sit in their lanes once they run out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to base to get more which takes them out of fights . - My approach is to keep Caitlyn ability spamming and aggressive for as long as possible . - To do this I built regeneration both mana and health at start with 3 mana potions . <p> This will get you to at least 520 gold while keeping your enemies at their turrets. - After that point I go back to get a Spirit Stone which has even more mana and health regeneration plus extra damage to monsters . - I use teleport for the first time to make this a trip quick and I 'm back in battle in no time . - When I come back now I have even more mana regeneration to spam my abilities and my abilities do even more damage . - This allows me to farm faster and clear the lane quicker which keeps the enemies pushed even further back on the turret . <p> The next item I buy is Spirit of the Elder Lizard , the cooldown reduction , mana regeneration , and on hit effect are lethal . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the burn effect the hit applies . - But now when you shoot Q through a lane of minions you can burn all 6 of them which helps with last hits . - The cooldown reduction allows you to hit all of them with Q a lot more times . <p> Next I go for attack speed with Hurricane but more importantly the Hurricane allows you to hit 2 extra enemies that are nearby . - Not only does this own in team fights but now you 're just demolishing minions you have an on hit effect and you 're firing 3 shots at a time with 70% attack speed . - Its demonic . - Berserkers Greaves adds more attack speed even . <p> The next stuff for Core is what youd see in a standard build , BOTRK first for even more attack speed and life steal . <p> So what I 've done is allowed you to deprive your enemies of gold and turned Caitlyn into an ultimate farmer . - Most games I clear more than 350 farm and have the highest gold . - This makes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the start and you can sell it at end for your 6th item . - Some people get rid of Hurricane but I 've found it to be very useful in team fights . <p> I 've also included Armor reduction items and Health Items for situational end game if your opponents start building armor on you . <h> Best Caitlyn Abilities <p> Always max Q first . - Most people max E next but I find it completely useless so I only get 1 point . - I max my traps next because I stand slightly behind them while laning so that any enemy champion that comes at me has no choice but to run into them , this roots them in place and then allows me to bounce away with E and fire at them . - Placing powerful traps in bushes will make the team think twice about going into the bushes to try and gank you . <h> Best Caitlyn Masteries <p> This is a pretty standard ADC build with Utility . - You can put into defensive if you like to stay alive longer . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conclusion <p> This build makes Caitlyn godly for sure , the worst thing that can happen to Caitlyn is to be stuck on her turret early game and not be able to farm the gold she needs to excel . - If the enemy has you back on your turret in the early game most of the time you can never recover .

@@30019028 @3719028/ <h> Best guide for the new Master Yi <p> Since Master Yi was reworked , it has been pretty confusing trying to figure out how to use him or where he belongs . From my experience , the new Master Yi is great out of the jungle . The jungle allows him to farm without the threat of a lane opponent denying him farm . While in the jungle he can farm all his camps and get himself built up to a DPS monster . In this guide , I will show you the correct way to build this monster . <h> No More AP <p> The first thing I should mention is that AP yi is no longer viable . Unless you want to run around and heal for ridiculous amounts of health and you can create a way for your team to win by doing that . It is best to just stick with AD Master Yi and Auto Attack enemies to certain death . <h> Summoner Spells <p> - Smite is required for every jungler , if you truly want to secure a buff or objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't  be the person that thinks they have a jungler that does n't  need smite . <p> Flash is a useful spell for Master Yi . It can help you easily disengage from a turret dive or engage on a fleeing enemy . Its a good go to summoner spell to have ready . <h> Abilities <h> - Passive : <h> - Q Ability <p> Overview : This is the same Alpha Strike that the old Master Yi used to do . It has a new animation and new scaling . Instead of ridiculous AP scaling it scales off of AD which will add to everything else Yi does . <h> W Ability <p> Overview : This is the only remaining spell that scales off of AP . It is n't worth it to sacrifice your build by building AP , with the healing being increased for every 1% missing health , you will still be healing for a lot . Since damage reduction is halved for turrets , it does n't  make Yi as viable as he was for tanking turrets for your team . <h> E Ability <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 5 seconds . It is basically a more powerful version of Irelias true damage ability . Scaling with AD , this makes Yi hit hard in the late game . <h> R Ability <p> Overview : This is basically like the old Master Yis highlander move , Instead of the instant reduction of cool down , this provides a reduced timer for cool downs . This ends the days of 5 straight Alpha Strikes with AP yi for a penta kill . <h> Ability Progression <p> This is the best ability progression for Master Yi in the jungle , if you start out with maxing Alpha Strike it will help clear all your camps quicker , it is tempting to max out Wuju Style for the True Damage it gives , but that that will sacrifice the early game strength of Alpha Strike . By maxing Wuju Style Mid/Late game you will be dealing crazy amounts of damage . <h> Item Build <p> For Master Yi , the best way to start is the usual Wriggles Lantern start . Youmuus Ghostblade is an amazing item on Master Yi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make this item more viable to buy in game . The infinity Edge adds an insane amount of Critical Strike Chance and Damage that scales with Master Yis Alpha Strike and Wuju Style . Statikk Shiv is a great pick up for the splash damage it provides that also applies critical strike damage . Being Master Yi , you will be focused hard in team fights so grabbing a Guardian Angel is a good item for more survivability and the revive is always useful . <h> Masteries <p> These masteries are the best for Master Yi . The damage that he gets from going into the offense tree helps him become the crazy jungling assassin he was reworked to be . The nine points that we put in the Defense Tree helps give him a little more survivability in game . <h> Runes <p> These are the best Runes for Master Yi . Playing against Master Yi , enemies will naturally be building Armor . With Armor Pen coupled with your masteries and Quints , you will be dealing a good amount of damage in the early phases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to play Master Yi , but I have found this to be the best way to build him and be a hard carry in game . His rework has made him insanely strong and he should be used the best way his kit offers . He is a great jungler and has ridiculous great game potential .

@@30019034 @3719034/ <h> How to carry yourself out of ELO Hell <p> You are here and reading this because you are in Elo Hell . Some people claim there is no Elo hell and that saying you are in Elo hell means you are at the level you should be at . I disagree with that statement . There are some people who do belong in the depths of Elo hell based on their skill , but even they can start slowly climbing the ranks to gold and platinum . <h> Understand the META <p> This might sound like a simple concept , ADC and Supp go bot , APC goes mid , tanky bruiser go top and someone occupies the jungle . While this is the META played by pros and most people , its not the case for Elo hell . When you are in low ranks such as Bronze and low silver , there is a whole new META that needs to be understood . You are put with 3 or 4 people you have never played before who all assume you are an idiot and do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove they know how to play by following exactly what the pros do . There will be all the main roles , but the way the game is played itself will change drastically . In higher Elo play , you always see Dragon and Baron being huge priorities to teams with players having counters on all the spawn times . These buffs are n't  as crucial in low Elo play . A big thing that consistently happens in Elo hell is once one lane gets one tower down , the whole team meets mid and tries to push . It sounds dumb , and people often make fun of it , but it works . If the team can coordinate enough to get to mid and get ready for team fights , you will be in good shape . Just be aware that Elo hell is different than everywhere else . I believe everyone is stuck because they keep playing the same way as higher ranks and it does n't  work there . <h> Play the Unplayed <p> Another thing players do in lower ranks is play all the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known champ , there is a good chance that the person you are laning against is going to know how to play against you . To get around this , simply try playing a champion that does n't  see much playing time . Or take a champion out of their usual role to a different lane . This works well for mid and top lanes . It wont always work for a bot lane ADC because they have their standard pool of champions to choose from for that role . If you can pick up a champion that you have never seen in a game or rarely see and learn them well enough , you can take them to the top or mid lane and completely dominate it . Your opponent will have a hard time figuring out how to beat you . It also helps with counter picking . In champion select , if you choose a champ that usually resides in a certain lane and take them elsewhere , the enemy team will have no idea how to counter pick . Some examples of champions that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attack Damage/ Attack Speed- <p> Sion Mid lane-Top lane/ Ability Power/ Movement Speed <p> Trundle- Top lane/ Attack Damage/ Attack Speed <p> Fizz- Top lane/ Attack Damage/ Attack Speed <p> These are a few examples of champions that do well in different lanes . If you can learn to play them really well , you will be able to win your lane 9 times out of 10 , giving your team that extra boost for winning the game . <h> Be flexible <p> Champion select can often set the tone of how the game is going to go . You get a lot of people saying what they want and chances are two or three of them are going to want the same role . When someone does n't  get the role they wanted they pout like a baby and threaten to feed . Try to at least have two champions you can play in every role and even more in the role you are really comfortable with . If someone is crying about wanting a role that you already have , it is better to just let them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone happy in champion select it will transition well into game . <p> Another thing in champion select is to pick the champion you are good with . So many times members of your team will encourage you to pick a champion because it " counter picks " an enemy champion . Do n't  listen to what they have to say . In Elo hell , there is no counters . The better player will always win the lane . Even if picking the champion you are really good with means getting hard countered by the enemy , go with it . It is always best to be comfortable with the champion you are playing . <h> Independence <p> If you are in a solo lane , do your best to hold your own without needing assistance from your jungler . If you can dominate your lane early , your jungler will be free to babysit the other lanes . Often in low elo games , there will always be that top laner that types " why no gank top ? " That drives me crazy when I see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own without much assistance from the jungler . If you can be independent during the laning phase , it will help your teammates win their lanes . <h> Communication <p> The sort of communication I am talking about is using the ping system . By the time you get into ranked games , every player should understand the ping system and how it works . Make it a priority to get all the needed pings in without spamming them . One missed MIA ping can be the start of a big downward fall from a teammate who got ganked from your lane opponent . The longer a team can hold of raging , the better they will play together . <h> Stay Calm <p> In Elo Hell , it is very hard not to rage at certain teammates for playing poorly . Almost always , you will get one person that does n't  really fit in and slowly drags the team down by feeding or just not playing well . If this happens , DO NOT RAGE ! The best thing to do would be to not say anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly advice or even switch lanes if you are doing well to try and give them an easier time . If you start raging at that player chances are they will play even worse . They get discouraged from all the hate and some might even AFK because it is n't worth it to play a game where your team just yells at you . <h> Have Fun <p> People tend to take ranked games way too seriously . Everyone wants to get out of Elo Hell so they go into a ranked game like they are headed to war . League of Legends is a game and it is meant to be played for fun . If you go into a game thinking you have to win at all costs , you end up playing worse because you 're too tense and worried about winning . If you relax and have fun and just play the way you play , you will have a much easier time climbing ranks <h> Walk Away <p> Every once and a while you will go on a losing streak . It could be 3 games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a losing streak and you just are n't  feeling it , it is better to step away from the game for a while rather than forcing more games because you do n't  want to end on a bad note . Losing streaks are n't  fun for anybody and being on one will probably make you moody or angry . This will only cause you to play worse in game and get mad at teammates and bring them down . Do everyone a favor and take a break and do something else for a while . Play a couple of normals and try to get a winning streak going that you can ride into ranked games . <h> Conclusion <p> These are some tips that you can use when you are stuck in the dreaded Elo hell . It is n't a sure thing you will gain rank . Obviously , there will be times where you get someone who disconnects or a teammate feeds way too much and you cant stop the enemy who is fed . However , these tips will be useful to remember when getting into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your game play you will be sure to see some Elo improvement .

Your enemies will stand around and wait for you to get out of Zhonyas leaving your teammates free reign to massacre them . Spirit Visage is an item that is made for Vladimir . You get insane health regeneration and 20% increased Spell Vamp and Lifesteal , that means that all of your abilities heal you for even more than they did before . Your enemies will continue to try and take you out , but you will always be healing during the whole battle . Rabadons is perfect for any mage along with Void Staff .

Since the top lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melee auto attacks , Vlad can easily counter with his long range auto attack and infinite sustain .

See the patch notes to see your classes changes . For example , Hunters will be able to auto-shot while moving . <p> Several pages of PvP and Battleground Changes . For example , Bloodlust , Heroism , Time Warp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arena . <p> Most Alliance racial traits and some Horde racial traits have been modified . <p> Commodity vendors will now sell- trade goods , these will accept Honor Points and Justice Points as payment .

These cost 8 Dreamcloth to craft . <p> Small changes to level 80-85 dungeons which will make the encounters slightly easier . <p> The following changes are potential gold making opportunities . They are excluded from the list above and given their own section below : <p> Gem- Requirement- Changes <p> All- Chaotic and- Relentless meta gems are having their activation requirement changed to 3 red gems . This is going to cause a lot of people who are currently using these gems to need or want to regem the rest of their gear in order to activate their meta .

If you 're tracking prices already for this gem , buy as many as you can below price and start selling them when the patch goes live . This wont change the price of these gems in the long run , but for several days we should see increased prices . <p> Volatile Life and Flasks <p> The number of herbs used make flasks are being reduced slightly and the amount of Volatile Life required is being increased slightly . Considering the wide range of uses for Volatile Life , this will only have a minor impact on the price of Volatile Life . Never the less , it will be beneficial to hold onto your Volatile Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Maelstrom Crystals <p> There are several new enchanting recipes being added to the game , including three new Bracer Enchants : Agility , Major Strength and Mighty Intellect .

If you can get your hands on some cheap Maelstrom Crystals , wait to sell them in the week following Patch 4.0.6s release date ( hopefully Tuesday ) . All three of these recipes are- available- only as a world drop so it might be awhile before people start- buying- Maelstrom Crystals for this purpose . <p> Jewelcrafters <p> Along with the addition of 3 new meta gems ( which are world drops ) , Blizzard is also adding a new design : - Vivid Dream Emerald .

@@30019050 @3719050/ <h> Guide on How to Harass and Trade in Your Lane <h> Trading in lane <p> To trade in lane means to exchange shots with the person you are in lane with . This concept gets really tricky because exchanging in lane can mean missing a lot of CS , taking aggro from minions/turrets , and getting baited right into a junglers gank . This article will explain how to effectively trade in lane and ultimately winning your lane . <h> Watching the minions <p> The very best way to harass your enemy is to watch your minions health bars . If you see a health bar going down and see the enemy going in for the last hit , use an auto-attack to hit them . They either get punished for taking the CS or they avoid getting poked but miss the CS . Doing this will slowly chip away at the enemys health until you can go all in to get the kill . The enemy will also miss out on a lot of farm and then you will get ahead in your lane . <h> Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to harass and trade in lane effectively is to watch your lane opponent very closely . Do n't  just watch where they are on the map but also watch their stats and what they are building . If you see your lane opponent did n't  buy a ward let your team know that . If your opponent does n't  have any sustain , poke him down until he has to go back to base to heal up . If your opponent went full offense , just play safely until he makes a mistake or your jungler comes in to help gank for you . A lot of the time people die and do n't  know how they did n't  kill their enemy , if you watch what items , stats , and summoner spells your enemy has you can quickly work it out to know if you could win an exchange or not . <h> Widdle down your enemy <p> A big mistake a lot of people make in lane is thinking that if your enemy attacks you he is going to go for an all in fight . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the fight and win it in a matter of seconds . Early game all ins are tough due to low damage output and low sustainability . In the early game the best way to approach an all in is to widdle down your enemy to a point where you know you can all in and burst them down before they have a chance to react . Poking and harassing your enemy laner will bring them down - to that point . So make sure you are only going all in if you are 100% sure you will win the exchange . <h> Be aware of the Mini-Map <p> It is very easy to get caught up in farming and trying trade with your lane opponent and forget about your mini map . Watching your mini-map will help give you vision of other important things going on in the game . You need to be watching for your jungler , and the enemy jungler . If you see the enemy jungler heading toward your lane , it would be a good time to disengage from any fight you were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is headed to your lane . If your jungler pings that he is coming to your lane , prepare for it . Let your enemy push the lane and get ready to go all in when your jungler is ready . <h> Own your lane <p> If you can follow the tips from this guide you will be well on your way to owning your lane and feeling confident in your match-up from the start .

However most of the old talents have been made into specialized abilities and players will no longer have to go through the annoying process of clicking the screen 50+ times and setting thier charcters up which is good and bad . New Spells are now learned automatically and we will only use class trainers for changing talents , glyphs , class specialization , or to utilize the dual specialization feature . <p> This also means that most classes and specs are now cookie cutter with jsut a few twists that are selectable on the in game menu at specific levels .

@@30019072 @3719072/ <h> Best AD/AS lulu solo-top build Season 3 <p> Taking lulu to the top lane with Attack Damage and Attack Speed is a very viable way to play lulu . <p> I almost think she is better there than at support . <p> In this guide ill tell you the best way to utilize attack damage on lulu . <h> RUNES <p> I like to use these runes for Lulu because her early game harass is really good . Once you get one point in your Q , W , E you can land a good combo for first blood . The AD you get from these runes will also help in farming <h> Masteries <p> These are masteries I prefer to use with AD lulu . You get good health by going into the defense tree and you start off with some Attack Speed and cooldown in the offensive tree . It all adds to help the early game harass that makes Lulu so annoying to enemy champions . <h> Item Build <p> I prefer to start with the rejuvenation bead over fairy charm because you wont have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bead will help you stay in lane longer to farm . I go 5 reds and 1 blue but it is up to you if you on how much you want to take . It all depends on if you plan on spamming a lot of abilities or if you think you might get harassed back quite a bit . I rush the Blade of the Ruined King on lulu . It provides Attack Speed , Life Steal , Attack Damage , and an active that can be useful in tight situations . Its a good item to start rushing because it has a lot in its recipe . It allows you to upgrade and buy more everytime you return to base , so you do n't  ever leave empty handed . Late game AD lulu crushes with the late game build . You will have a lot of Attack Speed and Attack Damage along with Armor Pen . Guardian Angel is good to have in team fights if you are getting focused . It will allow you to get back up and with Lulus abilities you might be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely in your teams favor . Ending items can vary , but I have found this to be the most useful build for her . <h> Ability Sequence <p> This is the way I level up Lulus abilities . I like to max Glitterlance first because of the damage it provides along with a very helpful slow that can allow to you escape a bad situation or catch up to someone who is almost dead . I max her " Help ! Pix " next because it provides damage if you use it on an enemy or a shield for you that will end up saving your life . I max Polymorph last because it does n't  do too much other than the speed buff and morphing the enemy . I put an early point into it to help in lane . <h> Tips <p> AD lulu is very good in the early game . She has a very safe and effective poke with glitterlance and the ability to Polymorph if an enemy champion decides to fight back . If you land a Polymorph in an exchange , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> A lot of people underestimate how hard Lulu is to actually kill . With all your abilities used correctly you should be able to escape ganks with ease . Do your best not to spam all of her abilities because she unfortunately has long cooldowns on her Polymorph and " Help ! Pix " to start the game . <p> Her passive is what makes her so awesome . Her passive allows pix to fire an auto attack right after yours . You are essentially getting two auto-attacks in one . You are basically firing twice as much as your enemy is in the early game . <p> Be careful about picking her in any kind of solo que . People usually question someone who wants to take Lulu top . The best thing to do is to tell your team what you are planning on doing . When they tell you it is a bad idea , assure them you have done it before and you will do well for them . Sometimes , they are interested and even encourage you to do it because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fun way to play Lulu . It is an easy way to counter a lot of top laners . Most often ( especially in low elo ) they will have no idea how to handle you . They come into lane thinking it will be an easy win so they become aggressive and end up giving you first blood . She does n't  tank very well , so you might not want to take her if no one else on your team is willing to play a tanky champion . She takes time to learn and understand her cooldowns and mechanics . If you take the time to play her and get really good , you will be having a lot of fun owning top lane .
