For example : <p> Spanish : <p> Yocomopizza . <p> English : <p> Ieatpizza . <p> Here both sentences start with a subject , move on to a verb , and finish off with an object . But this is n't always the case . Certain Spanish verbs are " backwards " verbs which force us to change the order of the sentence . Gustar is the most common of these verbs . <h> How to Use Gustar <p> How would you translate this sentence : <p> Ilikepizza . <p> If you look up " to like " in the dictionary , you 'll probably be told to use gustar . This might prompt you to translate the sentence : <p> Yogustopizza . <p> But that 's not the correct translation even though gustar is the appropriate verb to use in this situation . While it 's not wrong to say that gustar means " to like , " it 's not exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gustar means " to be pleasing . " Knowing that , you can see that you ca n't really translate " I like pizza " word for word . Instead you 'll need to first change the sentence to something like : <p> Pizzais pleasingto me . <p> The meaning has n't changed , but you 're expressing it a different way . Notice that what used to be the object ( pizza ) is now the subject of the sentence , and what used to be the subject ( I ) is now an object ( me ) . <h> Backwards Verbs <p> So how do we translate " Pizza is pleasing to me " ? Well , we still need to make another change before we can translate . Gustar is a member of a class of verbs sometimes called " backwards verbs . " Sentences that use backwards verbs have an abnormal sentence structure . Rather than appearing at the beginning of the sentence , the subject comes after the verb . Therefore the subject ( the thing that is pleasing ) comes at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that that , and the sentence starts with an object pronoun ( which refers to the person being pleased ) . So instead of " Pizza is pleasing to me " we should translate : <p> Keep in mind that we 're conjugating gustar to agree with the plural subjects at the end of the sentence ( tacos , galletas , huevos , and papas fritas ) . The objects ( me , te , nos , and les ) do n't affect our verb conjugation even though they 're at the beginning of the sentence . <p> The vast majority of the time , you 'll use either gusta ( if one thing is liked ) or gustan ( for more than one thing ) . It 's rare that you would need gustas or gustamos and there are other , better ways of conveying that meaning . See Liking People below . <p> Note : Because they are not " countable " you should always use gusta with infinitives : Me gusta leer y escribir . <h> Using Gustar with More Than One Subject <p> Once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may encounter sentences that look like they contain a grammatical error , such as : <p> Me gusta el arte y la msica.I like art and music . <p> Art and music are two things , right ? Should n't gusta ( singular ) really be gustan ( plural ) ? <p> Not always . Things get a little messy when y is used in the subject . The official rule comes down to " countability . " If your subjects are " countable " ( tangible , concrete , specific ) you should treat them as plural and use gustan : <p> Me gustan el vestido y la cartera.I like the dress and the purse . <p> If your subjects are non-countable ( abstract , indefinite ) you should treat them as singular and use gusta : <p> Me gusta la tecnologfa y la moda.I like technology and fashion . <p> Regardless of grammar , you 're more like to see and hear the singular gusta when the subject has an y in it , even if the subject is countable . <h> Ambiguity with Le and Les <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ os as your indirect object pronoun , the meaning of the sentence should be quite clear . However , if you use le or les , it 's not readily apparent who you 're talking about . For instance , how would you translate these sentences ? <p> Le gustan libros . Le gustan pelfculas. +Les gustan las canciones ? <p> A Cookie Monster le gustan mucho las galletas . <p> The first sentence could be translated " He likes books , " " She likes books , " or even " You ( Ud. ) like books . " To clear up any confusion , Spanish speakers will often add some context to the sentence by adding a and a pronoun : <p> +A Uds. les gustan las canciones ? Do you like the songs ? ( Are the songs pleasing to you ? ) <p> A Indiana Jones no le gustan los serpientes . <p> It may seem redundant to include both a Tl and le in the same sentence since they mean the same thing , but it happens regularly in Spanish . Even if we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronoun with gustar . <p> In a similar way , if you need to include someone 's name in the sentence , you 'll start with a followed by their name , and you 'll still use the indirect object pronoun : <p> A Rodrigo y Felipe les gusta su escuela.Rodrigo and Felipe like their school . ( Their school is pleasing to Rodrigo and Felipe . ) <p> Remember that the a is necessary because even though Elena , Marco , Rodrigo and Felipe are at the beginning of the sentence , they 're the objects of the sentence , not the subjects . We need to say " To Elena , " " To Marco , " and " To Rodrigo and Felipe . " <h> Added Emphasis <p> We can also use a and a prepositional pronoun where it would otherwise be unnecessary in order to emphasize whose opinion you 're discussing : <p> +A ti te gusta Coca Cola ? You like Cocal Cola ? <p> A mf me gusta Pepsi.Me , I like Pepsi . <p> Even though they are redundant , a ti is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me to put a stronger emphasis on the " you " and the " me . " <h> Notes on Gustar <h> Gustar Questions <p> " +Te gustan manzanas ? +C=mo te gustan esas manzanas ? " <p> Normally to turn a sentence into a question we move the subject from the beginning of the sentence to the end . With gustar the subject is already at the end of the sentence so all we need to do is add the question marks : <h> Liking People <p> Gustar is typically used to state that you like things , not people . While it 's not out of the question to say something like Me gustas t ( " You are pleasing to me " ) or Les gustamos ( " We are pleasing to them " ) , those expressions can indicate physical attraction and should be used carefully . You 're better off re-wording things or using the phrase caer bien : <p> Eres mi amigo.You 're my friend . <p> Me cae bien Ronaldo.I like Ronaldo . <p> Les caemos bien.They like us . <p> Caer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this context would be more like " to leave a good impression . " You can use caer mal to indicate dislike : Me cae mal Ronaldo. 
@@100547634 @4747634/ <p> ( Notice that no distinction is made between the singular and plural forms of the possessive adjective corresponding to " you " although in some parts of the United States " you all 's " or " y'all 's " would not look out of place in the plural column . ) <p> In Spanish , as in English , there are two types of possessive adjectives : short form and long form . We 'll look at the short form first : <h> Short Form Possessive Adjectives in Spanish <p> The basic short form possessive adjectives look like this : <p> mi <p> nuestro <p> tu <p> vuestro <p> su <p> su <p> You may be wondering why tu does n't have the accent you 're accustomed to seeing . Remember the word t is a subject pronoun and means " you . " The word tu ( without the accent ) is an adjective and means " yours . " Understanding this distinction is very important . <p> We use short form possessive adjectives in Spanish the same way we do in English . We place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like this : <p> ( short form ) possessive adjective + noun <p> Some examples : <p> English : <p> mycar <p> yourcar <p> ourcar <p> Spanish : <p> micoche <p> tucoche <p> nuestrocoche <p> If the examples above look pretty easy , they 're only the basic forms . Like any good Spanish adjective , possessive adjectives need to agree in number so we have some variations for plural forms : <p> mi , mis <p> nuestro , nuestros <p> tu , tus <p> vuestro , vuestros <p> su , sus <p> su , sus <p> Now would be a good time to talk about what we mean by " plural " in this situation . The plural form is used when we have more than one thing being possessed , not when we have more than one possessor : <p> English : <p> mycars <p> yourcars <p> ourcar <p> Spanish : <p> miscoches <p> tuscoches <p> nuestrocoche <p> Good hospitality begins with good possessive adjectives . <p> In the first example , since there is more than one car , " my " is translated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarly in the second example , " your " is translated in the plural tus even though there is only one of you . In the last example there is more than one of us , but we use the singular nuestro because this time there is only one car . If you can remember that adjectives ( even possessive adjectives ) only agree with the nouns they modify , this concept should n't be too difficult . <p> But now it 's going to start to get complicated , because Spanish adjectives also need to agree in gender . Look at our ( simplified ) chart again : <p> mi(s) <p> nuestro(s) <p> tu(s) <p> vuestro(s) <p> su(s) <p> su(s) <p> We ca n't really change the " i " in mi from one gender to another since " i " is gender-neutral . The same thing can be said for the " u " in both tu and su . We can , however , change nuestro and vuestro from their current masculine states to feminine ones which means we have even more variations : <p> mi(s) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> su(s) <p> su(s) <p> Just like how we decide whether to use a singular or a plural adjective , we pick a masculine or a feminine adjective based on the gender of the thing(s) being possessed , not the gender of the possessor : <p> ( a group of girls ) <p> ( a group of boys ) <p> ( a group of girls ) <p> English : <p> ourbicycle <p> ourbicycle <p> ourbooks <p> Spanish : <p> nuestrabicicleta <p> nuestrabicicleta <p> nuestroslibros <p> In the first example nuestra agrees ( in gender and in number ) with the noun it modifies , bicicleta , and has nothing to do with the fact that it belongs to a group of girls . You 'll notice that changing the ownership to a group of boys does nothing to the phrase because the noun being modified is still bicicleta ( singular and feminine ) . Likewise in the last example nuestros agrees in gender and in number with libros and has nothing to do with the girls ( gender or number ) who own the books . <h> Ambiguity With Su @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> sucamisasucochesusllaves <p> Looking at our charts we see that su and sus could mean " his , " " her , " " its , " " your " ( in the Ud. or Uds. form ) , or even " their . " While there would n't be much confusion with any of the other possessive adjectives , su and sus cause some trouble since they can mean so many different things . What do Spanish-speaking people do in order to be understood ? <p> First of all , context will take care of most of these kinds of problems . If these phrases popped-up in a conversation about Gloria , for example , it would be fairly clear that they mean " her shirt , " " her car , " and " her keys . " But if you heard them it in a conversation about different things belonging to different people , it would n't be so clear . If context does n't help , we can use a more accurate construction including the preposition de . <p> article + noun + de + pronoun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiscar <p> yourkeys <p> Spanish : <p> sucamisa <p> or <p> la camisade ella <p> sucoche <p> or <p> el cochede Tl <p> susllaves <p> or <p> las llavesde Ud . <p> ( You may be wondering why " de Tl " does n't get shortened to " del . " It 's important that we do n't shorten it in this situation because " de Tl " does n't mean " of the " but rather " of he " meaning " his . " ) <p> It looks strange to English speakers but possessive adjectives are frequently omitted when talking about body parts and clothing ( and other items closely associated with a person ) . This is especially true of sentences including an object pronoun : <p> English : <p> My back hurts . <p> She broke her glasses . <p> Spanish : <p> Me duele mi espalda . Me duele la espalda . <p> Ella rompi= sus anteojos . Ella rompi= los anteojos . <h> Long Form Possessive Adjectives in Spanish <p> " Sweet child of mine . " Great use of a long form possessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " possessive adjective , Spanish also has a " long form . " Before you start to complain about the complexity of Spanish , remember that English also has several ways to show possession . Consider : <p> my sweet child <p> or <p> sweet child of mine <p> this , my little light <p> or <p> this little light of mine <p> We can see how these two options relate to each other by comparing them side to side : <p> short form : <p> long form : <p> my <p> our <p> your <p> your <p> his , her , its <p> their <p> of mine <p> of ours <p> of yours <p> of yours <p> of his/hers <p> of theirs <p> Here are the corresponding short form and long form possessive adjectives in Spanish : <p> short form : <p> long form : <p> mi(s) <p> nuestro(s) , nuestra(s) <p> tu(s) <p> vuestro(s) , vuestra(s) <p> su(s) <p> su(s) <p> mfo(s) , mfa(s) <p> nuestro(s) , nuestra(s) <p> tuyo(s) , tuya(s) <p> vuestro(s) , vuestra(s) <p> suyo(s) , suya(s) <p> suyo(s) , suya(s) <p> The long form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has a complete set of singular/plural , masculine/feminine options . One thing worth noting is that the nosostros and vosotros possessive adjectives are exactly the same in the short form and long form . <p> Now that we know what long form possessive adjectives are , it would be a good idea to know how to use them . Long form possessive adjectives follow this pattern : <p> article + noun + ( long form ) possessive adjective <p> Some examples : <p> short form : <p> misllaves <p> sucoche <p> nuestracasa <p> long form : <p> las llavesmfas <p> el cochesuyo <p> la casanuestra <p> So the short form comes before a noun and the long form comes after , but looking closer you can see another important difference . A short form possessive adjective replaces the article in front of the noun ( e.g. " las llaves " becomes " mis llaves " ) , but that article needs to remain in front of the noun using a long form possessive adjective ( e.g. " Las llaves mfas " ) . <p> As usual our adjective needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it modifies . And remember that we 're talking about the gender and number of the item possessed , not the possessor of the item . <p> ( a man ) <p> ( a woman ) <p> ( a group of women ) <p> English : <p> mybicycle <p> mymap <p> ourbooks <p> Spanish : <p> la bicicletamfa <p> el mapa mfo <p> los librosnuestros <p> In the first example the man is ( obviously ) masculine , the bicycle is feminine , and the adjective , mfa , is also feminine to agree with the noun it modifies , bicicleta . The same scenario is true of the other two examples ( and yes , mapa is masculine ) ; the genders and number of the women have no impact whatsoever on the gender and number of the adjectives used . <p> Now it 's time to answer the most important question regarding short form and long form possessive adjectives . Why use one form instead of the other ? Let 's take a look at some translations : <p> long form : <p> la bicicletamfa <p> El mapa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or <p> the bicycleof mine <p> mymap <p> or <p> the mapof mine <p> ourbooks <p> or <p> the booksof ours <p> As you can see the long form can be translated two different ways . One translation uses the word " of " and puts the possessive adjective after the noun . The other way is exactly the same as how we would translate the short form . Which begs the question , " If they 're translated the same way , how do I know which to use ? " <p> Well , if you needed to translate something like " the dog of yours " you would have to utilize the long form ( " el perro tuyo " ) . If on the other hand , you needed to translate " your dog , " you could use either form ( " tu perro " or " el perro tuyo " ) . <p> The short form is more common in everyday situations and the long form tends to sound a bit more cultured or refined but they are mostly interchangeable . <h> Possessive Pronouns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronouns . Whereas an adjective is a word that modifies a noun , a pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun . Some examples : <p> noun : <p> the car <p> John Elway <p> Paco and I <p> pronoun : <p> it <p> he <p> we <p> Similarly a possessive pronoun is a word that replaces a possessive adjective/noun combination : <p> adjective/noun : <p> mycar <p> yourdog <p> ourbooks <p> pronoun : <p> mine <p> yours <p> ours <p> It may make more sense to you in the context of a sentence : <p> adjectives : <p> Mybike is red , yourbike is green , and herbike is blue . <p> pronouns : <p> Mine is red , yours is green , and hers is blue . <p> In the first sentence " my , " " your , " and " her " are possessive adjectives that modify " bike . " In the second sentence " mine , " " yours , " and " hers " are possessive pronouns because they have replaced " my bike , " " your bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentence more compact . We have n't explicitly stated what " mine " or " yours " is , but the context makes it clear that we 're talking about " my bike " and " your bike . " <p> The possessive pronouns in English ( with the possessive adjectives for comparison ) : <p> adjectives : <p> pronouns : <p> my <p> our <p> your <p> your <p> his , her , its <p> their <p> mine <p> ours <p> yours <p> yours <p> his , hers , its <p> theirs <p> And now the Spanish : <p> adjectives ( long form ) : <p> pronouns : <p> mfo(s) , mfa(s) <p> nuestro(s) , nuestra(s) <p> tuyo(s) , tuya(s) <p> vuestro(s) , vuestra(s) <p> suyo(s) , suya(s) <p> suyo(s) , suya(s) <p> mfo(s) , mfa(s) <p> nuestro(s) , nuestra(s) <p> tuyo(s) , tuya(s) <p> vuestro(s) , vuestra(s) <p> suyo(s) , suya(s) <p> suyo(s) , suya(s) <p> If the long form adjectives look exactly the same as the pronouns , it 's because they are . The only difference between the two is what comes before them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article and a noun . A possessive pronoun is preceded by an article only . <p> The formula for using a long form possessive adjective is : <p> article + noun + ( long form ) possessive adjective <p> And the formula for a possessive pronoun is : <p> article + possessive pronoun <p> Here are some examples : <p> short form : <p> micoche <p> tuperro <p> nuestroslibros <p> long form : <p> el cochemfo <p> el perrotuyo <p> los librosnuestros <p> pronoun : <p> el mfo <p> el tuyo <p> los nuestros <p> If you can handle the long form possessive adjective , all you need to do to change it into a pronoun is get rid of the noun . In the samples above we simply remove " coche , " " perro , " and " libros " from the long form to get our pronouns . 
@@100547635 @4747635/ <p> Notice the differences in the third-person row .

However , much of the time when we use a number we follow it up with a noun , e.g. " six cars , " " 24 tables , " " 38 houses , " etc . When we do this we 're actually using the number as an adjective and some interesting things need to happen . <p> First of all uno gets shortened to un when it comes before a masculine noun , and likewise numbers ending in " -uno " are shortened to " -n " ( note the accent mark ) . Ciento is also shortened to cien when ( and only when ) we 're dealing with exactly 100 of something . For example : <p> un coche <p> veintin coches <p> cien coches <p> ciento tres coches <p> Secondly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers agree in gender with the nouns that they modify . However , this only happens with numbers ending in " -uno " and words ending in " -ientos " ( all of the " hundreds " words from 200 to 900 ) . For example : <p> masculine : <p> un coche <p> veintin coches <p> cien coches <p> quinientos coches <p> feminine : <p> una pluma <p> veintiuna casas <p> cien casas <p> quinientas casas <p> Every part of a number that can agree with the gender of the noun should agree . For example 654,321 tables would be written out as " seiscientas cincuenta y cuatro mil trescientasveintiuna mesas . " <h> Decimal Points and Commas <p> You may have noticed the strange looking decimal points in the right hand column above . This is not a typo . The majority of Spanish-speaking countries do the opposite of English-speaking countries when it comes to decimal points and grouping thousands : commas are used for decimal points and periods are used to separate the groups of zeros . The number " 21.7 " would be written " 21,7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siete . " <h> Ordinal Numbers <p> While we use cardinal numbers to count things , we use " ordinal numbers " to put things in order ( such as the order in which runners finish a race ) . Here are the Spanish ordinal numbers : <p> primero <p> segundo <p> tercero <p> cuarto <p> quinto <p> sexto <p> sTptimo <p> octavo <p> noveno <p> dTcimo <p> onceavo / undTcimo / decimoprimero <p> doceavo / duodTcimo / decimosegundo <p> dTcimo tercero <p> dTcimo cuarto <p> etc . <p> --- <p> vigTsimo <p> vigTsimo primero <p> vigTsimo segundo <p> etc . <p> --- <p> trigTsimo <p> cuadragTsimo <p> quincuagTsimo <p> sexagTsimo <p> septuagTsimo <p> octogTsimo <p> nonagTsimo <p> centTsimo <p> milTsimo <p> ltimo <p> first <p> second <p> third <p> fourth <p> fifth <p> sixth <p> seventh <p> eighth <p> ninth <p> tenth <p> eleventh <p> twelfth <p> thirteenth <p> fourteenth <p> etc . <p> --- <p> twentieth <p> twenty-first <p> twenty-second <p> etc . <p> --- <p> thirtieth <p> fortieth <p> fiftieth <p> sixtieth <p> seventieth <p> eightieth <p> ninetieth <p> hundredth <p> thousandth <p> last <p> When used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the noun they modify , therefore " -o " endings change to " -a " with feminine nouns . For example : la segunda casa , su tercera novia , mi ltima tarea . <p> The ordinals primero and tercero are shortened to primer and tercer when used with masculine nouns . For example ; en primer lugar , en tercer grado . This is only true of primero and tercero . <p> When an ordinal prefix ending in " -imo " is combined with " octavo " one of the o 's is dropped to avoid repeating the same sound , e.g. " decimoctavo . " <p> Ordinals are not typically used with dates ; use cardinal numbers instead : " Hoy es el quince de enero . " <p> We often use a sort of shorthand abbreviation for ordinals in English ? 1st , 2nd , 3rd , etc . We can do something similar in Spanish ? 1 , 2 , 3 , etc. ( or 1 , 2 , 3 , etc. if feminine ) <h> Fractions <p> We express Spanish fractions the following way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> tres cuartos <p> cuatro quintos <p> cinco sextos <p> seis sTptimos <p> siete octavos <p> ocho novenos <p> nueve dTcimos <p> nueve centTsimos <p> nueve milTsimos <p> etc . <p> a whole ( 1/1 ) <p> one half ( 1/2 ) <p> two thirds ( 2/3 ) <p> three quarters ( 3/4 ) <p> four fifths ( 4/5 ) <p> five sixths ( 5/6 ) <p> six sevenths ( 6/7 ) <p> seven eighths ( 7/8 ) <p> eight ninths ( 8/9 ) <p> nine tenths ( 9/10 ) <p> nine hundredths ( 9/100 ) <p> nine thousandths ( 9/1000 ) <p> etc . <p> From " un cuarto " on we 're using the same words as we did for the ordinals . <h> Multiples <p> Note : Multiples can also have masculine and feminine forms : cudruplo , cudrupla . <p> We use " multiplicatives " to make multiples out of a number . Spanish multiples are similar to the English : <p> doble <p> triple <p> cudruple <p> qufntuple <p> sTxtuple <p> sTptuple <p> =ctuple <p> n=nuplo <p> dTcuplo <p> etc . <p> double <p> triple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> nonuple <p> decuple <p> etc . <h> Percentages <p> " El 60 por ciento de las veces funciona siempre . " <p> Precentages are written the same way in Spanish as they are in English . When spoken , " percent " is por ciento . <p> 6 por ciento <p> 6 percent ( 6% ) <p> 75 por ciento <p> 75 percent ( 75% ) <p> 99 por ciento <p> 99 percent ( 99% ) <h> Fun Numbers Facts <p> When writing checks in Spanish it is acceptable ( and a good idea ) to write " un mil " rather than the grammatically correct " mil " to ensure that no one alters the check amount . <p> Writing " two or three " in Spanish looks like this , " 2 o 3 , " and could possibly be confused with " 203 . " Because of this the " or " is somtimes accented to avoid confusion : " 2 = 3 . " ( As handwriting is being replaced by technology , the need to do this is diminishing. )

@@100547639 @4747639/ <h> Demonstrative Adjectives and Pronouns in Spanish <p> As the name would indicate , " demonstratives " are words that help us " demonstrate " where something is . They are quite often accompanied by pointing and gestures . Demonstratives fall into two categories : demonstrative adjectives and demonstrative pronouns . <h> Demonstrative Adjectives <p> Imagine that you 're in a store browsing through merchandise and talking to a salesperson behind the counter . As you discuss the various products , you will likely use words like , " this , " " that , " " these , " and " those . " <p> I 'd like to try on this ring . How much does that book cost ? What are these toys made out of ? I want to buy three of those light bulbs . <p> The underlined words above are known as demonstrative adjectives . Which adjective you use depends on two things : 1 ) how many objects there are , and 2 ) how close they are to you . Using this information we can build a grid : <p> singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these <p> far : <p> that <p> those <h> Este , Estos , Ese , Esos <p> Spanish is similar , albeit with one major difference that we 'll get to later . <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> near : <p> este <p> estos <p> far : <p> ese <p> esos <p> Some examples : <p> Quisiera probarme este anillo . I 'd like to try on this ring . <p> +Cunto cuesta ese libro ? How much does that book cost ? <p> +De quT son estos juguetes ? What are these toys made out of ? <p> Quiero comprar tres de esos bombillos . I want to buy three of those light bulbs . <p> Please note that even though they are adjectives , we place este , ese , estos , and esos in front of the nouns they modify instead behind them like we normally do . <p> Also note that the demonstrative adjectives for nearby items are este and ese , not esto and eso . It may seem inconsistent with what you already know about adjectives , but that 's just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can help you keep your demonstrative adjectives straight : " This " and " these " have t 's , " that " and " those " do n't . <h> Esta , Estas , Esa , Esas <p> If that seemed too easy , it 's because it is . Since adjectives ( even the demonstrative kind ) always agree in gender and in number with the nouns they modify , our Spanish chart needs to be a little more complex : <p> masculine : <p> feminine : <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> near : <p> este <p> estos <p> esta <p> estas <p> far : <p> ese <p> esos <p> esa <p> esas <p> Note : Accent marks and pronunciation are important . Do n't confuse esta , the adjective , with est , the form of estar . <p> Now we can talk about feminine objects as well : <p> Quisiera probarme esta pulsera . I 'd like to try on this bracelet . <p> +Cunto cuesta esa revista ? How much does that magazine cost ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of ? <p> Quiero comprar tres de esas bufandas . I 'd like to buy three of those scarves . <p> The demonstrative adjectives changed to agree with the nouns they modify . <p> But we 're still not done , because in addition to the " near " and " far " demonstrative adjectives , Spanish throws in a third category that does n't exist in English : <h> Aquel , Aquellos , Aquella , Aquellas <p> masculine : <p> feminine : <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> near : <p> este <p> estos <p> esta <p> estas <p> far : <p> ese <p> esos <p> esa <p> esas <p> really far : <p> aquel <p> aquellos <p> aquella <p> aquellas <p> So what 's going on here ? If an object is close enough to touch or right in front of you , use the first line from the chart above : este , or esta ( for more than one object , estos or estas ) . If the object is a little farther away from you , use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esos or esas ) . And if the object is not in your general vicinity , use the last line : aquel or aquella ( plural : aquellos or aquellas ) . <p> Please note that once again the masculine singular demonstrative adjective does n't follow the normal pattern . It 's aquel , not aquello . <p> Imagine that you 're in the store again . You want to know the prices of a series of watches . The first watch is lying on the counter in front of you . The second is in the display case a few feet to one side . And the third watch is hanging on the wall behind the salesperson . Your questions might sound something like this : <p> Notice that both ese and aquel ( or esa and aqella ) translate to " that " in English . And both esos and aquellos ( or esas and aquellas ) translate to " those . " It can be helpful to add the words " over there " when dealing with forms of aquel . <p> Determining when you should use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of aquel is not an exact science . One way that might make it clearer is to think of it this way : If the object you 're discussing is closer to you than it is to the person you 're talking to , use a form of este . If the object is closer to the person you 're talking to , use a form of ese . And if the object is n't near either of you , use a form of aquel . <h> Demonstrative Pronouns <p> Cultural Note : While you can use your finger to point at any object , in some areas it is considered rude to point at people that way . You may want to nod your head or use a different gesture instead . Speaking of which , some Latinos will point at things with their lips by pursing them together like blowing a kiss . <p> Now let 's talk demonstrative pronouns . Remember that an adjective is a word that modifies a noun , but a pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping for a pen . Rather than say the word " pen " over and over again , you will probably use pronouns : " How much is this pen ? " " How much is that one ? " " What color are these ? " <p> Here are some more examples . The first sentence includes an adjective . The second one uses a pronoun : <p> I like this car . She prefers that one . I like these videos . She prefers those ones . I like these trees . She prefers those . <p> Notice how we sometimes include the word " one " or " ones " with our pronouns . <p> In Spanish , the pronouns that we use look very similar to the adjectives : <p> Note : Recently , the rule requiring demonstrative prounouns to have accents has been relaxed . The Real Academia Espaola now recommends that accents only be used to prevent ambiguity . Not everyone agrees with the REA , however ; best to check with your teacher , professor , boss , etc . <p> The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pronouns . The accent does n't change the pronunciation at all ; it falls on the syllable that would normally be stressed anyway . It 's only used to distinguish pronouns from adjectives in writing . Coincidentally , the accent mark falls on the first " e " in every pronoun . <p> Note how we still have the third " really far " category with our pronouns just as we did with the adjectives . It works exactly the same way . <h> Neuter Pronouns <p> Now we can translate " this " and " these " and " that " and " those " without any problems , right ? What about in these situations ? <p> We 're lost and we have no gas . This is not good . <p> I like reading a good book . I like that too ! <p> The underlined words are pronouns , but the problem is that they are n't replacing a specific noun , but rather a concept ( " being lost " or " reading " ) . That 's not a big deal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to use the correct pronoun . What is the gender of " being lost " or of " reading a good book " ? We really ca n't say . So what do we do ? We use a neuter pronoun that 's neither masculine nor feminine : <p> Estamos perdidos y no tenemos gasolina . Esto no es bueno . <p> Me gusta leer un libro bueno . Me gusta eso tambiTn ! <p> There are three neuter demonstrative pronouns : esto , eso , and aquello . We are n't worried about gender with neuter pronouns . We also are n't worried about number since we 're replacing a ( singular ) concept not ( plural ) objects . 
@@100547640 @4747640/ <h> What 's a Direct Object ? <p> There are different kinds of objects . Objects which answer the questions " what ? " or " whom ?

Buy it ! <p> Notice that when we add pronouns to the end of infinitives , present participles , and commands , we may need to add an accent mark to the verb to preserve the original stress ( because we 're adding extra syllables to the verb ) . Also notice that when we have a compound verb like " estoy comprando " or " quiero comprar " we may either attach our pronoun to the second verb or put it in front of the first , but we never put it in between the two verbs . <p> And remember , if we do n't have an affirmative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must come in front of the verb : <p> No locompres !

" Consider this sentence : <p> Nos entiendes . <p> While it looks like it could mean , " We understand , " it actually means , " You understand us . " The subject is omitted in this sentence , but we can see from the way the verb is conjugated that the subject is t .

The conjugation rule is consistently applied to every verb . The bad news : as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the preterite conjugations are the basis of the imperfect subjunctive there are a few issues worth reviewing : spelling changes , " -ir " stem changing verbs , and irregulars in the preterite . <p> Note : For a complete listing of preterite irregulars , be sure to review The Preterite Tense and pay special attention to the ellos/ellas/Uds. forms . <h> Imperfect Subjunctive " -se " Endings <p> They are n't as widely used but there is another possible set of imperfect subjunctive endings that you may see or hear in Spanish . The verbs are conjugated in exactly the same way ; only the endings are different . These conjugations mean the same thing ; it 's completely up to you which form to use but you 're more likely to be understood with the " -ra " forms . <p> Here are the " -se " endings , and the verb hablar conjugated with both the " -ra " endings and the " -se " endings for the sake of comparison . 
@@100547642 @4747642/ <h> What is Conjugating ? <p> Conjugating is the act of taking a verb and changing it so that it ? agrees ? with its subject . For example let 's change the subject of this sentence , " We have a ladder , " from " we " to " Manuel " : <p> We have a ladder . ? Manuel has a ladder . <p> In order for the subject and verb to agree , we needed to change the verb " have " into " has . " This is conjugation . <p> Poor verb conjugation was just one of the XFL 's many problems . <p> It sounds funny when a verb is conjugated incorrectly : <p> I has a ladder . <p> If you 've grown up speaking English you can conjugate verbs without even thinking about it ; it just comes naturally . Conjugating verbs in Spanish , however , will not come easily . You ? ll need to stop and think every time , and practice , practice , practice until it becomes second nature . <h> Infinitives <p> A non-conjugated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no subject specified , an infinitive has ? infinite ? conjugation possibilities . English infinitives include the word ? to. ? Check out the chart below and compare the infinitives to some conjugated counterparts . Notice how there is no indication as to what the subject of an infinitive is : <p> infinitive : <p> conjugated : <p> to play <p> to sing <p> to have <p> to be <p> ? <p> ? <p> ? <p> ? <p> he plays <p> she sings <p> we have <p> they are <p> Unlike English infinitives , Spanish infinitives are only one word , but they ? re still pretty easy to spot . <h> Three Types of Spanish Infinitives <p> Note : Not all words ending in ? -ar , ? ? -er , ? or ? -ir ? are verbs . E.g. lugar is a noun which means ? place. ? <p> Note : " -ar " verbs are the most common , followed by " -er " and " -ir " verbs . <p> All Spanish infinitives have one of three endings : ? -ar , ? ? -er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conjugating Spanish Verbs <h> Verb Tenses <p> Before we get into conjugating verbs , we need to briefly talk about ? tenses. ? A tense is a form of a verb that indicates what timeframe you ? re referring to . There are three basic tenses : past , present , and future : <p> I ran . I run . I will run . <p> But there also are more tenses ( in both English and Spanish ) . For example : <p> I had run . I have run . I will have run . <p> There are specific lessons for each and every tense on this website , but for the time being we ? ll work with the present tense . <p> The next step is finding the infinitive we need and breaking it into two parts : the stem and the ending . A good dictionary will tell us that " to speak " is hablar in Spanish . The stem of hablar is " habl " and the ending is " -ar " : <p> infinitive : <p> stem : <p> ending : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now we need to look up ( or better yet , memorize ) the appropriate chart of verb endings . The present tense " -ar " verb endings are listed in a chart below , to the right . ( Remember we 're using " -ar " verb charts because hablar is an " -ar " verb . ) To the left are subject pronouns once again . Notice how each box on the subject pronouns chart corresponds to a box on the verb endings chart . This is not a coincidence : <p> subject pronouns : <p> yo <p> nosotros , -as <p> t <p> vosotros , -as <p> usted <p> ustedes <p> Tl , ella <p> ellos , ellas <p> ? <p> " -ar " endings : <p> -o <p> -amos <p> -as <p> -is <p> -a <p> -an <p> -a <p> -an <p> We need to find the ending that corresponds with our subject . Since our subject is yo , we 'll add the verb ending " -o " to our stem ( " habl " ) : <p> subject pronouns : <p> yo <p> nosotros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ustedes <p> Tl , ella <p> ellos , ellas <p> ? <p> " -ar " endings : <p> -o <p> -amos <p> -as <p> -is <p> -a <p> -an <p> -a <p> -an <p> Put it all together and we get : <p> Yo hablo.I speak . <p> Let ? s try another . The infinitive dibujar means ? to draw. ? How do we conjugate it to mean ? we draw ? ? Strip off the ending , identify the subject pronoun ( nosostros ) , and add the appropriate ending ( " -amos " ) to the stem ( " dibuj " ) : <p> subject pronouns : <p> yo <p> nosotros , -as <p> t <p> vosotros , -as <p> usted <p> ustedes <p> Tl , ella <p> ellos , ellas <p> ? <p> " -ar " endings : <p> -o <p> -amos <p> -as <p> -is <p> -a <p> -an <p> -a <p> -an <p> Add the subject pronoun and we get : <p> Nosotros dibujamos.We draw . <p> OK , so what about ? -er ? and ? -ir ? verbs ? We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts . Here all all three ( present tense ) charts together . Notice the similarities and differences : <p> " -ar " endings : <p> " -er " endings : <p> " -ir " endings : <p> -o <p> -amos <p> -as <p> -is <p> -a <p> -an <p> -a <p> -an <p> -o <p> -emos <p> -es <p> -Tis <p> -e <p> -en <p> -e <p> -en <p> -o <p> -imos <p> -es <p> -fs <p> -e <p> -en <p> -e <p> -en <p> The infinitive correr means ? to run. ? Let ? s use it to say ? You run. ? ( In this case the ? you ? will be a singular , informal ? you. ? ) <p> The stem is ? corr. ? The ending ( from the ? -er ? chart ) is ? -es. ? Add a subject pronoun and we get : <p> T corres.You run . <p> ( Remember we 're pulling the ending from the ? -er ? chart because correr is an ? -er ? verb . ) <p> How about an ? -ir ? verb ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to say ? We live. ? The stem is ? viv , ? the ending is ? -imos , ? and the subject is ? nosotros ? : <p> Nosotros vivimos.We live . <p> Failing to conjugate verbs correctly sounds just as bad in Spanish as it does in English . If you say " I has a ladder " in English , people will look at your funny . Same thing if you say " Nosotros viven " in Spanish . <h> Simplified Verb Ending Charts <p> You won ? t often see verb charts like the ones shown above . Why ? Because they ? re slightly more complicated than they need to be . Notice how the usted endings are all the same as the Tl / ella endings ? And how the ustedes endings are all the same as the ellos / ellas endings ? That ? s not only true of present tense verb endings ; it ? s true of all the other tenses as well . Therefore it ? s much easier to compact the endings into six box grids , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the Ud. in the Tl / ella box just to simplify things , not because it means ? he ? or ? she. ? Likewise , remember that Uds. does n't mean ? they. ? It ? s just in the ellos / ellas box because the verb endings are the same . <p> Make sure you understand this grid . It 's very important ; you 'll be seeing a lot of it as you study Spanish . <h> Subjects Not on the Chart ? <p> What if you want to use a subject that 's not on the subject chart ? Remember that those are pronouns , or words that take the place of other nouns . You don ? t have to use a pronoun , but you still need to pull the ending from the corresponding place on the chart : <p> Barack Obama Tl Ram=n and I nosotros Susana and Ram=n ellos <p> ? <p> Barack Obama habla . Ram=n y yo corremos . Susana y Ram=n viven . <h> Irregular Verbs <p> All this conjugation stuff may already seem overwhelming , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain verbs that do not follow the normal rules for conjugations . Those verbs are know as ? irregular ? verbs . You ? ll have to specifically memorize their conjugations because the normal procedures don ? t work . Here ? s an example of an infamous irregular verb in the present tense , ser ( to be ) : <p> soy <p> somos <p> eres <p> sois <p> es <p> son <p> None of the conjugations follow any of the rules . Lovely , is n't it ? <p> But before you start complaining about irregular Spanish verbs , consider how irregular English can be . Imagine if you were a Spanish speaker having to learn this : <p> to play ( regular ) : <p> to be ( irregular ) : <p> I play <p> You play <p> He plays <p> We play <p> They play <p> I am <p> You are <p> She is <p> We are <p> They are <h> Omitting Subject Pronouns <p> Due to the fact that many English verb conjugations are the same , subject pronouns are very important . Look what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What is the subject ? He , she , it ? We ca n't tell . The opposite is true in Spanish . Because there are many different conjugations , the verb often makes it obvious what the subject is , and a pronoun is n't necessary . For example : <p> Hablamos espaol.We speak Spanish . <p> Corres muy rpidamente.You run very quickly . <p> Vivo en Tijuana.I live in Tijuana . <h> Conjugating Verbs in Other Tenses <p> Different tenses have different rules for conjugating . Some tenses only have one or two sets of verb endings . Other tenses require you to add endings to the infinitive , not the stem . Still others require you to create an entirely different stem , but the same basic principal of subject verb agreement holds true . You will always find the subject you need from the subject pronouns chart , then find the ending you need in the corresponding box on the verb endings chart . 
@@100547643 @4747643/ <h> How to Use Infinitives <p> By now you know that the basic , non-conjugated form of a Spanish verb is called an " infinitive . " You 've probably already spent a good deal of time learning how to conjugate infinitives or change them so that they agree with their subjects . But we do n't always conjugate our infinitives . There is a wide variety of non-verb situations in which we leave the infinitive unchanged . <p> But first of all , a quick reminder . Any verb that has a subject must be conjugated : <p> Yo leo el peri=dico.Not:Yo leer el peri=dico.I read the newspaper . <p> That 's enough on conjugating . When can we leave our infinitives unconjugated ? <h> Using Infinitives as Subjects <p> Note : Sometimes the article el is used with an infinitive to emphasize the fact that it is a subject . <p> When we want to use a verb as a noun in English , we use gerund ( " -ing " ) form of the verb . We do not do this in Spanish . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urge to use the present participle ( " -ando " or " -iendo " ) form of the verb : <h> Using Infinitives as Objects of a Verb <p> What 's an " object of a verb " ? It 's a fancy way of describing an infinitive that comes immediately after a conjugated verb . Deber ( to should ) , poder ( to be able to ) , querer ( to want to ) , and soler ( to usually ) are verbs which are commonly followed by an infinitive . They are sometimes referred to as " modal verbs . " Modal verbs need to be followed by another verb because they do n't make much sense on their own . Some examples : <p> Debes pagar la multa.You should pay the fine . <p> +Puedo ir al bao ? Can I go to the bathroom ? <p> +Quieres bailar conmigo ? Do you want to dance with me ? <p> Suele mirar televisi=n despuTs de las clases.He usually watches television after school . <p> Other verbs that are often followed by infinitives are decidir ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , intentar ( to try to ) , preferir ( to prefer to ) , and saber ( to know how to ) . Some examples : <p> Decidf regresar inmediatamente.I decided to return immediately . <p> Ella espera viajar a Londres.She hopes to travel to London . <p> Preferimos no tener tarea.We prefer not to have homework . <p> Intentamos mover la piedra . We tried to move the stone . <p> Yo sT nadar muy bien.I know how to swim very well . <h> Using Infinitives with Sensory Verbs <p> Note : The infinitive must immediately follow the sensory verb . <p> Infinitives can also be used directly after sensory verbs : <p> Escucho hablar el poeta.I listen to the poet speak . <p> La vf bailar.I saw her dancing . <p> Siento calentar el sartTn.I feel the frying pan heating up . <p> Huelo cocinar la sopa.I smell the soup cooking . <h> Using Infinitives as Objects of a Preposition <p> Note : When used with an infinitive , al means " upon . " <p> When following a preposition , verbs should be left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present participle like we do in English : <p> The rules for using por and para are long and complex . Read more about them at Using Por and Para . <h> Using Infinitives in Special Expressions <p> There are many special infinitive constructions in Spanish that use a bewildering variety of prepositions ( like a , de , en , and con ) . Some of them are somewhat logical . Others make no sense whatsoever . You 'll be much better off just memorizing which verbs go in which category than trying to figure out why . <p> The first category : <h> Verb + a + Infinitive <p> Note : When used with an infinitive , volver a means " to do something again . " <p> Why do we need to put an a before the infinitive ? We just do . Verbs commonly appearing in this category are aprender , ayudar , comenzar , empezar , ensear , ir , and volver . Some examples : <p> You may occasionally hear expressions like " a ver " or " a leer " meaning " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All that 's happening here is that " ir + a + infinitive " expression has been shortened by removing the vamos . <p> The next category on the list : <h> Verb + de + Infinitive <p> Note : When used with an infinitive , acabar de means " to just have done something . " <p> Why do we need to put a de before the infinitive ? We just do . Some verbs that fall into this category are acabar , dejar , tratar , tratarse . Some examples : <h> Using Infinitives as Impersonal Commands <p> You should conjugate your commands according to the subject ( the person you 're commanding ) . But that 's not always possible . For example , if you hang a sign in a store with a command on it , you have no idea who is going to be reading it . Because of this , non-conjugated infinitives are often published as impersonal commands : <p> A good idea in any language . <p> No fumarNo smoking <p> EmpujarPush <p> No echar basuraNo littering <p> No tocarDo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be tempted to overuse it . Remember , if the subject does n't change from one clause to the next , use an infinitive , not a subjunctive verb : 
@@100547644 @4747644/ <h> The Preterite Tense <p> The Preterite Tense ( also spelled " preterit " ) is one of two ways to talk about events that happened in the past in Spanish . The preterite tense is used to indicate a single , completed action that took place at a specific point in time . For example : <p> Armando me llam= a las nueve.Armando called me at nine o'clock . <p> Regresaron de Espaa ayer . They returned from Spain yesterday . <p> Olivia se fue esta tarde . Olivia left this afternoon . <p> Preterite conjugations can be pretty tricky due to the large amount of irregular verbs and some other complicated situations .

It 's absolutely critical that the " o " in the Tl/ella/usted form conjugation get an accent mark so it is n't confused with the present tense yo form conjugation . <p> To conjugate regular " -er " and " -ir " verbs in the preterite , take off the endings and add the following : <h> Preterite Spelling Change Verbs <p> The yo form endings for " -ar " verbs occasionally cause pronunciation problems because some letters are pronounced differently depending on the vowels that follow them . The letters " c " and " g , " for example , sound different when they 're followed by an " a " or an " o " than when they 're followed by an " e " or " i . " Since the preterite yo form ending is an " e " , we need to change the spellings of the stems of " -car " verbs , " -gar " verbs , and " -zar " verbs in order to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? qu ) : <p> jugar ( g ? gu ) : <p> lanzar ( z ? c ) : <p> toquT <p> tocamos <p> tocaste <p> tocasteis <p> toc= <p> tocaron <p> juguT <p> jugamos <p> jugaste <p> jugasteis <p> jug= <p> jugaron <p> lancT <p> lanzamos <p> lanzaste <p> lanzasteis <p> lanz= <p> lanzaron <p> Tocar has a " -que " ending in the yo form to keep the original " c " sound being pronounced like a " k " rather than like an " s . " Jugar now has a " -gue " ending to keep the original " g " sound pronounced like a " g " rather than like an " h . " And lanzar now has a " -ce " because , well anytime we can use a " c , " we should . The " e " ending gives us an opportunity to do so . <p> It does n't happen often , but " -guar " verbs will also require a spelling change . Take a verb like averiguar which means " to verify . " When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to add a " dieresis , " which means the " u " becomes a " n " : <p> Yo averignT los datos ayer.I verified the facts yesterday . <p> The " n " tells us to pronounce the " gu " like a " gw " so that our pronunciation will be consistent with the infinitive , averiguar . <p> These spelling changes only happen for " -ar " preterite verbs and only in the yo form because the " -e " is the only ending that creates problems for the " c , " " g , " " z " and the " gu . " <h> More Spelling Changes <p> Certain " -er " and " -ir " verbs are also going to need spelling changes to keep pronunciation consistent . This time around it 's the Tl/ella/Ud. and ellos/ellas/Uds. forms that cause problems . The endings for those conjugations are " -i= " and " -ieron . " Notice how they both start with two vowels ? If we have a verb whose stem ends in a vowel , and then we add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with three vowels in a row . It 's difficult to pronounce a word with a three vowel combination . To solve that problem , we change the " i " to a " y . " <p> Some common trouble making verbs conjugated in the ellos/ellas/Uds. form : <p> infinitive : <p> stem : <p> three vowels : <p> i ? y spelling change : <p> caer <p> ca- <p> caieron <p> cayeron <p> contribuir <p> contribu- <p> contribuieron <p> contribuyeron <p> creer <p> cre- <p> creieron <p> creyeron <p> leer <p> le- <p> leieron <p> leyeron <p> incluir <p> inclu- <p> incluieron <p> incluyeron <p> ofr <p> o- <p> oieron <p> oyeron <p> The Tl/ella/Ud. form conjugations will use the same spelling change . Here is a complete set of conjugations for some common verbs : <p> Note : In addition to the " i " ? " y " spelling change , it is necessary to add an accent mark to the t , nosotros , and vosotros form endings . ( The yo form already has an accent . ) <p> caer : <p> leer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> cafsteis <p> cay= <p> cayeron <p> lef <p> lefmos <p> lefste <p> lefsteis <p> ley= <p> leyeron <p> of <p> ofmos <p> ofste <p> ofsteis <p> oy= <p> oyeron <p> As you can see , this " i " ? " y " spelling change only occurs in the bottom row of conjugations . <p> Note : Verbs ending in " -ir " or " -llir " use " -= " and " -eron " endings instead of " -i= " and " -ieron " because they already have a " y " sound in their stems : gru= , zambulleron . <p> An exception to the " i " ? " y " spelling change rule are " -guir " verbs and " -quir " verbs . While the stems do end in a vowel , the " u " is not actually being pronounced . Because of that , we can pronounce the three vowels in a row and a " y " is not necessary . <h> Preterite Stem Changing Verbs <h> Stem Changing " -ar " and " -er " Verbs <p> All " -ar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the present tense are completely regular in the preterite , which is to say that they do n't have stem changes in the preterite .

It can be helpful to put them into groups to help you memorize them . <p> That 's not a typo ? the conjugations of ir and ser are identical ? context makes the meaning clear . <p> If you look carefully , you 'll notice that hacer is n't completely irregular ( it could fit quite nicely the " i " group ) but the need for consistent pronunciation forces us to use a " z " in the Tl/ella/usted form .

@@100547646 @4747646/ <h> How to Use Ser and Estar <p> " To be , or not to be ? " was Hamlet 's perplexing question . The Spanish student must grapple with a similar one : " Which ' to be ' to use ? " <p> There are several instances in Spanish where one English word ( or tense ) can be translated two different ways in Spanish ( Por and Para , The Imperfect Tense and the Preterite Tense , Ser and Estar ) and the decision you make can have an impact on the meaning of the sentence . Translating from Spanish to English is not a problem because both ser and estar become a form of " to be . " Translating from English to Spanish on the other hand is much more difficult because a decision needs to be made on which of the two words to use . <p> Before we get too much further , let 's take a quick look at the ( present tense ) conjugations of both verbs : <p> ser : <p> estar : <p> soy <p> somos <p> eres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ests <p> estis <p> est <p> estn <p> Ser is completely irregular , and estar has an irregular yo form along with accented endings in all but the nosotros and vosotros forms . <h> Ser and Estar : The Basics <p> So how do we decide which verb to use ? Here 's when we use estar : <h> When to Use Estar <p> Helpful Rhyme : " To say how you feel and where you are , you should use the verb estar . " <p> An easy way to think about the verb estar is that it is used to describe temporary conditions and locations . Conditions can be mental , emotional , or physical states of people , animals , and objects . Locations are quite simply where something or someone is . <p> Pepe y Pablo estn en mi dormitorio . Emilia est enferma . <p> Note : Because estar is associated with location , words like " here " or " there " are optional : Jaime no est . ( Jaime is n't here . ) <p> " Pepe and Pablo are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so estn ( not son ) is used . " Emilia is sick . " This sentence is talking about Emilia 's physical condition so est ( not es ) is used . <p> In both of these situations the condition mentioned is temporary . Presumably Pepe and Pablo wo n't always be in my room ; hopefully Emilia wo n't always be sick . <p> On the other hand ... <h> When to Use Ser <p> " Yo soy Groot . " <p> Since estar deals with temporary conditions , that leaves ser as the verb to use for more permanent situations . Generally speaking , ser is used when dealing with " inherent characteristics . " That 's a fancy way of saying things which are not likely to change . <p> Mi coche es amarillo . Sus hermanos son muy delgados . <p> " My car is yellow . " This is not likely to change . The car probably has been yellow for some time and will continue to be yellow into the future . We would n't expect it to suddenly be another color tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is a state that we would n't expect to change quickly . When we think of these brothers , we think of them as being thin and do n't expect them to rapidly put on weight . <p> Notice that in these examples it 's not impossible that the characteristics would change ( cars are repainted all the time , and thin people sometimes get bigger ) . It 's just unlikely to expect that they would soon . <h> The Exception : Events <p> It would n't be a rule if it did n't have an exception , right ? In spite of the fact that it deals with a location , we use ser rather than estar to talk about where and when events will take place . <p> " The party is at Alejandro 's house . " " The soccer games are at the stadium . " Both of these situations might feel like we should be using a form of estar since we 're dealing with where these things are happening , but we use ser with events . Think of ser as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estar : Differences in Meaning <p> Your choice of using either estar or ser can also have an impact on the rest of the sentence . Certain adjectives will convey different meanings based on which verb they 're paired with : <p> La manzana es verde . La manzana est verde . <p> The first sentence uses ser so we 're talking about an inherent characteristic of the apple . It should be translated , " The apple is green , " meaning simply that the color of the apple is green . The second sentence uses estar so we 're dealing with its current condition . This sentence should be translated something along the lines of , " The apple is not ripe , " meaning that it still needs to ripen up and turn red . Another example : <p> +C=mo eres t ? +C=mo ests t ? <p> Both of these sentences could be translated exactly the same way in English , " How are you ? " However , since the first sentence uses a form or ser , the implied question is not " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you usually ? " or better yet , " What are you like ? " The second question is the more familiar " How are you ? " or " How are you doing ? "

Some examples : <p> The works painted by Picasso were very popular . The buildings were destroyed by the tornado.We have played basketball since we were little . <p> In English past participles often end in " -ed " but there are many irregulars : <p> drawn , divided , eaten , insisted , spent , understood <h> Regular Past Participles <p> To form a past participle in Spanish , we add " -ado " to the stem of " -ar " verbs and " -ido " to the stems of " -er " and " -ir " verbs .

However , as with all adjectives , we need to make sure it agrees in gender and in number with the noun it modifies . Therefore the full set of adjective endings will look like this : <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> masculine : <p> -ado / -ido <p> -ados / -idos <p> feminine : <p> -ada / -ida <p> -adas / -idas <p> Some examples : <p> Note : Past participles adjectives are frequently used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of something . <p> El aire de la ciudad est contaminado.The air of the city is polluted . <p> Los almuerzoscomidos por los chicos son saludables.The lunches eaten by the children are healthy . <h> Using Past Participles in Perfect Tenses <p> Past participles are also a necessary ingredient ( together with the verb haber ) in forming perfect tenses such as , " I have seen the movie , " " She had fallen asleep , " and " They would have left .

@@100547650 @4747650/ <h> Common Mistakes to Avoid <p> Learning any foreign language is not easy . Being able to communicate well is more than just being able to translate word by word . There are many different grammatical structures , syntaxes , idiomatic expressions , etc. that learners need to know and understand . Following is a list of the more common errors committed by Spanish students . ( Do n't feel bad if you make a mistake . Even with the notable advantage of being a cyborg from the future , The Terminator says " no problemo " when he ought to say " no problema . " ) <h> Noun-Adjective Agreement <p> In English one adjective ( e.g. " quick " ) works with any noun . In Spanish our adjectives need agree in gender and in number with the nouns they modify ( e.g. rpido , rpida , rpidos , rpidas ) . <p> Do n't : <p> las montaasbonito <p> Do : <p> las montaasbonitas <h> Adjective Placement <p> It 's the exact opposite of the way we normally do things in English but the vast majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noun . <h> Overusing Articles <p> When to use ( and not to use ) articles in Spanish can be bewildering . But one thing is certain : you will never have more than one article ( definite or indefinite ) . And possessive adjectives replace articles . <p> Do n't : <p> un el cuarto <p> su la bicicleta <p> Do : <p> un cuarto <p> subicicleta <h> Using Nouns with Nouns <p> We frequently use nouns as adjectives in English which is something we can not do in Spanish . If you need to use a noun to function as an adjective in Spanish make sure you separate the two nouns with a de . <p> Do n't : <p> inglTsclase <p> ftbolpartido <p> Do : <p> clase de inglTs <p> partido de ftbol <h> Possession <p> There is no " apostrophe s " in Spanish . We can not add " ' s " to the end of a name to make it into a possessive adjective . We must use this formula instead : noun + de + name . ( More on Possessive Adjectives ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do : <p> el librode Marta <p> el cochede mi padre <h> Gustar <p> Gustar is not a normal verb . It works the opposite of how we use its translation " to like . " We use indirect object pronouns where we 'd normally have our subject , and our direct object becomes the subject . ( More on How to Use Gustar ) <p> Do n't : <p> Yogustolas pelfculas . <p> Nosotrosgustamosel espaol . <p> Do : <p> Megustanlas pelfculas . <p> Nosgustael espaol . <h> When Fun Is n't Fun <p> In English , the word " fun " can function as a noun or as an adjective , but in Spanish we have different words for " fun " depending on how it 's used . Divertido ( or divertida ) is the adjective form . Diversi=n is the noun form . And do n't forget it 's best to just to use the verb , divertirse , which means " to have fun . " <p> Do n't : <p> El viajefuediversi=n . <p> Tuvediversi=n . <p> Do : <p> El viajefuedivertido . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word muy means " very . " It is an adverb and it comes in front of an adjective . Mucho means " a lot " or " much . " It is an adjective and modifies a noun . They are not interchangeable . <p> Do n't : <p> muchofeo <p> muytarea <p> Do : <p> muyfeo <p> muchatarea <p> The word bien means " well . " It is an adverb and it modifies a verb . Bueno ( or buen or buena ) means " good . " It is an adjective and it modifies a noun . Bien and bueno are also not interchangeable . <p> Do n't : <p> +l correbueno . <p> Tengo un amigobien . <p> Do : <p> +l correbien . <p> Tengo un amigobueno . <h> Objects and Subjects <p> A subject is a noun in a sentence that does the action of the verb . An object is a noun that receives the action of the verb ( or a noun to whom or for whom the action is done ) . Subject pronouns ( yo , t , Tl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ellas , ustedes ) and object pronouns ( me , te , le , lo , la , nos , os , les , los , las ) are not interchangeable . Neither can possessive adjectives be used as subjects . ( More on Direct &amp; Indirect Object Pronouns ) <p> Do n't : <p> Nospintamos la pared . <p> Sues inteligente . <p> Do : <p> Nosotrospintamos la pared . <p> Ellaes inteligente . <h> Using " It " <p> In English " it " can function as a subject pronoun ( " It was expensive " ) or an object pronoun ( " He stole it " ) . The same is not true of Spanish . In Spanish if " it " is an object pronoun , we use lo or la , but if " it " is the subject of the sentence , we omit the pronoun altogether . As an object lo or la ( usually ) precedes the verb in the sentence . 
@@100547651 @4747651/ <h> Spanish Parts of Speech ( Part 1 ) <p> Remember when you were learning grammar in middle school and you would ask yourself , " When are we ever going to need to know this ? " Well , the answer is " now . " When you speak in your native language you can use words quickly and easily without having to stop and think about how they function . But when you begin to learn a foreign language it 's necessary to know what kind of word you 're using in order to use it correctly . <p> Any language has thousands and thousands of words . But not all words are the same ; they have different jobs to do . Words are put into different categories or " parts of speech " based on how they function . We use these various parts together to build a sentence . For example , " dog " is a noun , " playful " is an adjective , " barked " is a verb , and " loudly " is an adverb . Put them together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barked loudly . " <p> Likewise , when using a dictionary it 's important to pay attention to what part of speech it is you 're looking for . A Spanish/English dictionary entry for the word " school " might look something like this : <p> school 1 n. escuela , 2 v. amaestrar , 3 adj. escolar . <p> All three entries mean " school , " but one is a noun , one is a verb , and one is an adjective . So which word do you use ? It depends on how you want it to function . How do you know ? Continue reading ... <h> Spanish Nouns <p> A noun you may remember is basically any person , place , thing , or idea . Quite often a noun is the subject of the sentence : <p> The small monkey jumped quickly . <p> Here " monkey " is a noun because it is the " thing " in this sentence . ( It also happens to be the subject . ) Some other examples of nouns : child , Argentina , house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this website will be highlighted like this : noun <h> Using Nouns <p> Congratulations ! It 's a boy ! <p> In Spanish a noun is called a " sustantivo " and it works the same way as it does in English except for one major difference : gender . That 's right , in Spanish nouns are actually classified as either " masculine " or " feminine . " Try not to get too wrapped up in figuring out what would make one word male and another word female . It 's got nothing to do with X and Y chromosomes . It 's a mostly arbitrary system of putting words into one of two categories . So how do you know which is which ? It 's based on spelling . <p> Most nouns end either in an " -o " or an " -a . " The vast majority of the time words with an " -o " at the end are considered masculine and words ending in " -a " are feminine : <p> masculine : <p> burro <p> libro <p> ocTano <p> zapato <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are some nouns which do n't follow this rule ( of course ) and other nouns which end with a different letter entirely . For those words you 'll just have to memorize the gender along with the word . <p> It 's easy to make nouns plural in Spanish . Add " -s " to words ending in vowels , and add " -es " to words ending in consonants : <h> Spanish Articles <p> When dealing with nouns you ca n't get far without talking about articles ( " artfculos " in Spanish ) . In English the words " a , " " an , " and " the " are all articles . We 'll start with the " the . " <h> Definite Articles <p> " The " is what 's known as a definite article , because if you use it , you probably have something specific in mind . There 's only one way to say " the " in English regardless of the noun ( or nouns ) involved : e.g. " the book , " " the magazine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But " the " is translated one of four ways in Spanish depending on the gender ( masculine or feminine ) and the number ( singular or plural ) of the noun it precedes . Nouns which are masculine and singular are preceded by el , feminine and singular by la , masculine and plural by los , and feminine and plural by las . <p> masculine : <p> feminine : <p> singular : <p> el libro <p> la revista <p> plural : <p> los libros <p> las revistas <p> Notice that to make a noun plural you need to change its ending as well as its article . And by the way , definite articles are used much more frequently in Spanish than they are in English . <h> Indefinite Articles <p> What about " a " and " an " ? These are known as indefinite articles because they are less specific than definite articles . Just like definite articles , there are four possibilities which need to agree in gender and in number with the nouns they refer to : un , una , unos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most any word that further describes ( or modifies , clarifies , qualifies , etc. ) a noun . In English adjectives usually come before the noun they modify : <p> The smallmonkey jumped quickly . <p> Here " small " is the adjective in the sentence because it modifies or describes the noun , " monkey . " Some other examples of adjectives : good , sixteen , blue , and Chinese . <p> Note : Adjectives used in examples on this website will be highlighted like this : adjective <h> Using Adjectives <p> In Spanish an adjective is called an " adjetivo " and there are several major differences between Spanish and English adjectives . First and foremost adjectives usually come after nouns in Spanish which looks very odd to English speakers . <p> English : <p> the redball <p> Spanish : <p> el bal=nrojo <p> And secondly , there are ( usually ) four forms of each adjective whereas in English there is only one . Like articles , adjectives need to agree in number ( singular or plural ) and in gender ( masculine or feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> feminine : <p> singular : <p> el libropequeo <p> la revistapequea <p> plural : <p> los librospequeos <p> las revistaspequeas <p> It is important to realize that in order to save space , most dictionaries will only list the masculine , singular adjective . When you look up an adjective in a dictionary , you may need to change the ending to agree with the noun your using . Want to see more adjectives ? Check out the List of Adjectives . <h> Spanish Verbs <p> The easy way to think of a verb is that it is the action word of the sentence . For example : <p> The smallmonkey <p> jumped quickly . <p> Here " jumped " is a verb because it is the action that the subject ( " monkey " ) is doing . However , verbs do n't have to be actions , they can also be " states . " For example : <p> The smallmonkey The smallmonkey The smallmonkey <p> is tired.belongs to the zoo.seems happy . <p> Unlike other parts of speech , verbs appear in many different forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : speak , spoke , have spoken , will speak , would speak , will have spoken , would have spoken . <p> Note : Verbs used in examples on this website will be highlighted like this : verb <h> Using Verbs <p> In Spanish a verb is called a " verbo . " Using a verb is no simple task because in Spanish each verb can take six different forms depending on it 's subject , and upwards of 17 forms depending on its " tense " and " mood . " That means that most verbs have over 100 different forms depending on how they 're being used . The process of changing your verb depending on its subject and tense is known as " conjugating " and there 's a whole separate article explaining how it 's done : Conjugating Verbs in Spanish . <h> Spanish Adverbs <p> An adverb is a little difficult to define , but one of its main functions is to modify or describe a verb : <p> The smallmonkey <p> jumpedquickly . <p> " Quickly " is the adverb in this example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also modify adjectives and even other adverbs : <p> The verysmallmonkey The smallmonkey <p> **37;71;TOOLONG . <p> In the first sentence " very " is an adverb because it describes the adjective " small . " In the second sentence " incredibly " is an adverb that modifies another adverb , " quickly . " <p> Some other examples of adverbs : honestly , carefully , always , and slowly . <p> Note : Adverbs used in examples on this website will be highlighted like this : adverb <h> Using Adverbs <p> In Spanish an adverb is called an " adverbio . " Adverbs in Spanish are similar to adverbs in English in that they are often derived from adjectives . In English we can usually recognize these adverbs by their " -ly " endings . But there are a substantial number of adverbs which do n't follow this rule : e.g. " well , " " never , " " very , " and " tomorrow . " <p> In Spanish we can create many adverbs by adding " -mente " to the feminine singular form of an adjective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick ) <p> lenta ( slow ) <p> completa ( complete ) <p> fcil ( easy ) <p> rpidamente ( quickly ) <p> lentamente ( slowly ) <p> completamente ( completely ) <p> fcilmente ( easily ) <p> However , there are many adverbs which do not follow this pattern : e.g. " bien , " " nunca , " " muy , " and " maana . " Want to see more adverbs ? Check out the List of Adverbs . <h> Spanish Pronouns <p> " Was president Lincoln okay ? " <p> Simply put , pronouns are words that replace nouns . Why replace a noun ? Well , consider this quote from the lovable Ralph Wiggum : " Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and the baby looked at me . " <p> Like most things Ralph says , this sentence is awkward . In this case it 's because he keeps saying " babies " over and over again when he ought to be substituting pronouns instead : " Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the them and it looked at me . " <p> Pronouns are useful for replacing larger words or concepts once they 've been introduced so they do n't have to be repeated . Pronouns can be subject pronouns , object pronouns ( both direct and indirect ) , and reflexive pronouns . ( There is also a class of pronoun called " possessive pronouns " which we wo n't get into here . ) <h> Subject Pronouns <p> In the second line " it " is a subject pronoun which has replaced the subject , " the small monkey . " <p> Some other examples of subject pronouns : I , you , he , she , we , and they . <h> Object Pronouns <p> Consider these sentences : <p> The smallmonkey The smallmonkey <p> The smallmonkey The smallmonkey <p> bitthe other monkey.bithim . <p> jumpedquickly for the trainer.jumpedquickly for her . <p> In the first example " him " is a direct object pronoun which replaces the direct object " the other monkey . " In the second example " her " is an indirect object pronoun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some other examples of ( direct and indirect ) object pronouns : me , you , her , it , us , and them . <h> Reflexive Pronouns <p> Consider : <p> The smallmonkey <p> sawhimself in the mirror . <p> In this sentence " himself " is a reflexive pronoun which replaces the concept of " the small monkey . " <p> Some other examples of reflexive pronouns : myself , yourself , herself , and themselves . <h> Spanish Prepositions <p> A preposition is a word which shows some relationship between two parts of a sentence . A preposition together with an " object of the preposition " creates a " prepositional phrase . " Some examples : <p> She slept in the bed . He traveled by train . They left at four o'clock . The watch is under the chair . <p> Fun Fact : The preposition de is the most common word in Spanish . <p> The underlined part of each sentence is a prepositional phrase which starts with a preposition ( " in , " " by , " " at , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the preposition ( " the bed , " " train , " " four o'clock , " and " the chair " ) . <p> Some other examples of prepositions : on , near , across , with , of , and toward . <h> Using Prepositions <p> Using prepositions in Spanish is easy because they work the same way as they do in English : <p> However , it can also be very difficult to translate prepositions . Many Spanish prepositions can be translated various ways into English and vice versa . En can be translated " in " or " on . " A can mean " to " or " by . " And both of them can be translated " at . " The most famous ( or infamous ) example of this problem is por and para . You need to know from the context of the sentence which preposition to use . There are also idiomatic expressions that need to be learned : Tl soaba con tener una vida mejor means " he dreamed about having a better life . " <p> Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Spanish/English dictionary with you as you learn the language .

@@100547653 @4747653/ <h> What 's an Indirect Object ? <p> Whereas direct objects answer the questions " what ? " or " who ? " receives the action of the verb , indirect objects ( IOs ) answer " to whom ? " or " for whom ? " the action is done . To identify IOs , read the sentence , stop at the direct object , then ask yourself " to whom or for whom ? " The answer to that question is an indirect object : <p> Note : A sentence with an indirect object usually also has a direct object . <p> They returned the book to whom ? They returned the book " to the teacher " ; " the teacher " is the indirect object . We gave the photos to whom ? We gave the photos " to our parents " ; " our parents " is the IO . She sent the letter to whom ? She sent the letter " to her son " ; " her son " is the IO . <h> What 's an Indirect Object Pronoun ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace indirect objects . In the following examples indirect objects have been replaced with indirect object pronouns : <h> Indirect Object Pronouns in Spanish <p> If we want to replace an indirect object with a pronoun , we need to use an indirect object pronoun ( IOP ) from the Spanish chart below : <p> English IOPs : <p> Spanish IOPs : <p> me <p> us <p> you <p> you <p> him , her , it <p> them <p> me <p> nos <p> te <p> os <p> le <p> les <p> IOPs also agree in person and number ( but not gender ) with the nouns they replace : <p> you ? te us ? nos her ? le them ? les <p> In English there is no difference between direct and indirect object pronouns . In Spanish , however , DOPs and IOPs have differences in the third-person row . This makes using object pronouns in Spanish very difficult as you need to know what kind of object you 're dealing with before you can translate . <p> Note that there are no gender distinctions with indirect object pronouns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " to her . " <h> How To Use Indirect Object Pronouns ( IOPs ) in Spanish <p> Note : IOPs can be used in impersonal expressions : Le es necesario salir . ( It is necessary for him to leave . ) <p> Note : This only occurs with IOPs . We do n't use direct objects and DOPs together in the same sentence . <p> It may seem redundant to use both an indirect object and an indirect object pronoun in the same sentence . We 'd never do it in English , but it happens quite often in Spanish , even when it 's not strictly necessary . In addition to using indirect objects together with IOPs for clarity , we can also use them together for emphasis : <p> Nosparece increfble a nosotros ! A mf no me gustar leer . <h> Pronoun Placement Alternatives <p> Just like with DOPs , we have some options for where to place IOPs depending on the sentence . <p> When using affirmative commands , we must attach our pronouns to the end : <p> C=mprameun regalo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronouns to the end of verbs , we may need to add an accent mark to the verb to preserve the original stress . And remember , if we do n't have an affirmative command , infinitive , or present participle , the object must come in front of the verb : <p> No mehables ! Do n't speak to me ! <p> Ya tehablT.I already spoke to you . <p> No tehe hablado.I have not spoken to you . <h> Common Mistakes with Indirect Object Pronouns <h> Taking Shortcuts <p> Since direct objects tend to refer to things and indirect objects are usually people , you may be tempted to simplify the rules a bit and use lo and la whenever you 're referring to a thing and le whenever you 're referring to a person . You ca n't do this . It may happen less frequently but DOs can be people and IOs can be things : <h> Bad English <p> Another way to get off track is to confuse DOPs and IOPs because of the bad habits in English . How would you write this sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> *Note : technically speaking in this case we should ask " Grandma sent whom ? " Here 's a free bonus English lesson : who/whom <p> Well , " Grandma " is the subject and " sent " is the verb . To figure out the direct object we ask " who ? " or " what ? " Grandma sent who* ? Grandma sent " her , " so we look at the DOP chart , la , and we end up with : <p> Nuestra abuela la envi= flores . <p> Right ? Wrong . The problem in this sentence is that " her " is not a DOP . It 's an IOP . While it looks like " her " answers the question " who ? " it 's really answering the question , " to whom ? " After all , grandma did n't really put " her " in a box and send her somewhere . The thing being sent was " flowers . " If we 're a little more careful with the English , it 's easier to translate : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing to , " the need for an IOP should make sense . There are a number of other verbs that also take indirect object pronouns exclusively . When you look at the translations it is obvious why some need IOPs , but others may not make sense . You 'll just have to get used to using IOPs with them . <p> aburrir ( to be boring ) <p> agradar ( to be pleasing to ) <p> bastar ( to be sufficient ) <p> disgustar ( to be disgusting ) <p> doler ( to be painful ) <p> encantar ( to be enchanting ) <p> faltar ( to be lacking ) <p> fascinar ( to be fascinating ) <p> hacer falta ( to be lacking ) <p> importar ( to be important ) <p> interesar ( to be interesting ) <p> molestar ( to bother ) <p> parecer ( to appear to be ) <p> picar ( to itch ) <p> placer ( to be pleasing to ) <p> quedar ( to be left over ) <p> If you ever see a sentence with an IOP where you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the verb requires one . <h> Indirect Object Pronouns in Spanish <p> Answer the question ? to whom ? ? or ? for whom ? ? is the action being performed . <p> English IOPs : <p> Spanish IOPs : <p> me <p> us <p> you <p> you <p> him , her , it <p> them <p> me <p> nos <p> te <p> os <p> le <p> les <h> How to Use Indirect Opject Pronouns in Spanish <p> Indirect object pronouns agree in person and number ( but not gender ) with the nouns they replace . <p> Object pronouns usually come in front of verbs . <p> Ellosledevolvieronel libro . <p> Object pronouns must be attached to the end of affirmative commands . <p> Object pronouns may be attached to present participles . <p> Object pronouns may be attached to infinitives . <p> Indirect objects are often used with indirect object pronouns for clarity or emphasis . 
@@100547654 @4747654/ <h> The Passive Voice in Spanish <h> Active Voice and Passive Voice <p> You may not realize it but most of the sentences you use are in what 's called the " active voice . " What this means is that the subject of the sentence did the action of the verb . For example : <p> Mateowrotethe poem . <p> Here " Mateo " is the subject and he is the one who did the writing ? this is active voice . <p> There is also another style known as the " passive voice . " In the passive voice the subject no longer does the action of the verb , but rather has the action done to it . To achieve this , we 're going to turn the direct object from the first sentence into the subject : <p> The poemwas written by Mateo . <p> In this case the subject , " the poem , " did not actually do the verb ; the verb was done to it ? this is passive voice . Notice that the former subject , " Mateo , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sentence . <p> Note : Most English teachers prefer that you use the active voice as much as possible when writing . <p> The meaning of the two sentences is essentially the same , so why would you choose one voice over the other ? Passive voice allows you to vary your sentences making your writing a little more interesting , and it allows you to shift the focus of the sentence from the agent ( Mateo ) to the object ( the poem ) . The passive voice also gives you the option of downplaying or ignoring the agent of the action altogether . Like this : <p> The poemwas written.The housewas robbed.Many mistakeswere made . <h> The Passive Voice in Spanish <h> Ser , Past Participles , and Por <p> In the English examples above the passive voice was constructed by using a form of " to be " with a past participle . We 'll do the same thing in Spanish using ser . For example : <p> active voice : <p> passive voice : <p> Mateoescribi=el poema . <p> Los ladronesrobaronla casa . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> La casafue robada por los ladrones . <p> Muchos erroresfueron cometidos . <p> All of the passive voice sentences employ a form of ser . Notice that it is conjugated to agree with the number of the subject ( fue or fueron ) . The examples also use past participles . Notice that because they are functioning as adjectives in the passive voice they need to agree in gender and in number with their subjects ( poema / escrito , casa / robada , and errores / cometidos ) . <p> Also notice that we use the word por to identify the agent of action . In the last example the agent ( yo ) was omitted , probably to avoid taking the blame . <p> Although it occurs less frequently , it is possible to use the passive voice in other tenses as well : <p> El poemaser escrito por Mateo.The poem will be written by Mateo . <p> La casahabfa sido robada por los ladrones.The house had been robbed by the thieves . <p> Muchos erroresson cometidos.Many mistakes are made . <h> The Passive Voice with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ser and a past participle for the passive voice , there is a much more common construction that involves the word se . It does n't have an English equivalent . <p> As you may recall we use the " impersonal se " when we 're referring in general terms to a person or people . For example : <p> +C=mo se escribe esa palabra ? How does one write ( spell ) that word ? <p> +Se puede salir aquf ? Can you exit here ? <p> Se dice que ella es muy bonita.They say that she is very beautiful . <p> Chicken for sale . <p> House for sale . <p> Dog for sale . <p> While all of these translations are active voice ( because the subjects are doing the actions ) , the impersonal se can be and often is translated in the passive voice : <p> Se vende gasolina.Gasoline is sold . <p> Se alquila apartamento.Apartment for rent . <p> Se hablan espaol y ruso.Spanish and Russian are spoken . <p> To use the impersonal se in the passive voice , simply start with se @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular or plural , depending on the number of things on which the verb is acting . For example , in the first two sentences , we only have one thing ( gasolina , apartamento ) so we conjugate in the singular ( vende , alquila ) . In the last sentence , we have two languages ( espaol y ruso ) so we conjugate in the plural ( hablan ) . <p> These impersonal se expressions are preferred to the ser form of the passive voice , especially in the present tense . It is possible to use the impersonal se in other tenses as well :

@@100547658 @4747658/ <h> The Present and Imperfect Progressive <p> Although it 's not really a " tense " in its own right , we occasionally use a verb form known as the " progressive . " Progressive verb forms indicate that an action is ongoing or currently taking place . Progressives require a form of the verb " to be " and what 's known as a " present participle . " In English , a present participle is a verb form ending in " -ing . " <p> I am studying . <p> In this example we see the two components we need : " am " is a form of " to be " and " studying " is the present participle . What about Spanish ? Read on : <h> Present Participles <p> Note : Do not confuse present participles we use in progressive forms ( like hablando and corriendo ) with the past participles we use in perfect tenses ( like hablado and corrido ) . <p> Let 's looks at present participles first . Whereas in English we form present participles by using " -ing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stem of " -ar " verbs and " -iendo " to the stem of both " -er " and " -ir " verbs . <p> infinitive : <p> ending : <p> present participle : <p> hablar <p> -ando <p> hablando <p> comer <p> -iendo <p> comiendo <p> vivir <p> -iendo <p> viviendo <p> There are ( always ) some exceptions , however <h> Spelling Changes <p> Note : By the way , the present participle of ir is " yendo . " <p> If we follow the normal present participle procedure , certain verbs are going to be difficult to pronounce . Take " leer " for example . When we add " -iendo " to the stem , " le- , " we end up with " leiendo . " It 's hard to know how to say this word because there are three vowels in the middle of it . To fix the three vowel problem , we take the " i " and replace it with a " y " : " leyendo . " This makes the word easier to pronounce . Most " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a vowel will require an " i ? y " spelling change . Some common examples : <p> infinitive : <p> stem : <p> three vowels : <p> i ? y spelling change : <p> caer <p> ca- <p> caiendo <p> cayendo <p> contribuir <p> contribu- <p> contribuiendo <p> contribuyendo <p> creer <p> cre- <p> creiendo <p> creyendo <p> leer <p> le- <p> leiendo <p> leyendo <p> incluir <p> inclu- <p> incluiendo <p> incluyendo <p> ofr <p> o- <p> oiendo <p> oyendo <p> Note : The same is true of " -quir " verbs : relinquir ? relinquiendo . <p> An exception to the spelling change rule are " -guir " verbs . Take " distinguir . " While the stem does end in a vowel ( " distingu- " ) , here the " u " is not actually being pronounced . Its sole purpose is to keep the " g " from being pronounced like an " h " due to the vowel following it . Because of that , even though <p> infinitive : <p> stem : <p> present participle : <p> distinguir <p> distingu- <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem of an " -er " or " -ir " verb ends in " - . " The " " already has a " y " sound built-in so to speak , so adding " -iendo " is n't really necessary . You can get away with just " -endo " : <p> infinitive : <p> stem : <p> present participle : <p> gruir <p> gru- <p> gruendo <h> Stem Changing " -ir " Verbs <p> Note : This only applies to verbs that are both stem changing and " -ir " verbs . Non-stem changing verbs are not affected , and neither are any " -ar " or " -er " verbs . <p> There is one other issue with present participles and that occurs with stem changing " -ir " verbs . In addition to the " o ? ue , " " e ? ie , " and " e ? i " stem changes in their present tense conjugations , these verbs have stem changes in their present participle forms . They will either have an " o ? u " stem change , or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> infinitive : <p> present tense : <p> present participle : <p> pedir <p> pido ( e ? i ) <p> pidiendo ( e ? i ) <p> servir <p> sirvo ( e ? i ) <p> sirviendo ( e ? i ) <p> sentir <p> siento ( e ? ie ) <p> sintiendo ( e ? i ) <p> mentir <p> miento ( e ? ie ) <p> mintiendo ( e ? i ) <p> dormir <p> duermo ( o ? ue ) <p> durmiendo ( o ? u ) <p> morir <p> muero ( o ? ue ) <p> muriendo ( o ? u ) <p> We 've only talked about half of the equation so far , we still need to discuss the " to be . " In Spanish , in all of our progressive forms , we 'll be using the verb estar . Which tense should we use ? That depends on what type of progressive <h> The Present Progressive <p> If the action we 're referring to is happening now ( in the present ) , we use the present progressive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense conjugation of estar with a present participle : <p> estoy <p> estamos <p> ests <p> estis <p> est <p> estn <p> + present participle <p> Note : To form a negative negative , place the no in front of the form of estar : No estoy comiendo . <p> For example : <p> Estoy comiendo.I am eating . <p> Ests leyendo.You are reading . <p> Ellos estn mirando la televisi=n.They are watching television . <p> It 's worth noting at this point that if you have an object pronoun of any sort ( reflexive , direct , or indirect ) , you have two options as to where to put it . You may either put it in front of your conjugation of estar , or you may attach it to the end of your present participle . ( Attaching an object pronoun will require adding an accent mark to preserve the original stress . ) Either way is perfectly acceptable and your sentence will mean exactly the same thing . <p> Note : You can not place the object pronoun in between estar and the present participle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the present progressive to refer to future events , we can not do the same in Spanish . In Spanish , the present progressive is strictly used to talk about actions that are occurring at a particular point in time . To refer to actions about to occur , we can either use the present tense , the future tense , or the future progressive . <h> The Imperfect Progressive <p> If we want to refer to an action that was happening ( at some point in the past ) , we use the imperfect progressive . As the name would imply , this time we 'll use an imperfect tense conjugation of estar with a present participle : <h> Other Verbs Used with Present Participles <p> Most of the time estar is used in progressive situations , but not always . There are some other verbs you can combine with a present participle too . Your choice of verb will subtly change the meaning of the sentence . <h> Seguir + Present Participle <p> Switch estar with seguir ( or continuar ) if you want to stress the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . A good way to translate this is to include the word " still " : <p> Sus sobrinas siguen jugando baloncesto.Her nieces are still playing basketball . <h> Other Progressive Tenses <p> While the present and imperfect progressive forms are the most common , we 're not limited to the present and the past . We can form progressives with any tense , such as the future , the conditional , or even the subjunctive . <p> Estaremos conduciendo.We will be driving . <p> Yo estarfa durmiendo.I would be sleeping . <p> Espero que t estTs divirtiTndote.I hope that you are having fun . <h> The Preterite Progressive <p> It may sound like an oxymoron , but there is also a " Preterite Progressive . " The difference between the imperfect progressive and the preterite progressive is much the same as the difference between the imperfect and the preterite ? a definitive time frame . Using the preterite progressive also emphasizes that the action was ongoing , but then stopped abruptly when interrupted . The preterite progressive is not very common .

This kind of pronoun functions as the object of a preposition and is known as a prepositional pronoun : <p> Note that except for the yo and t forms , prepositional pronouns are identical to subject pronouns . The pronoun mf carries an accent which is n't necessary for pronunciation , but helps to distinguish it from the possessive adjective , mi . <p> Whenever we have a preposition followed by a pronoun , that pronoun needs to be a prepositional pronoun ( not a subject pronoun ) .

@@100547660 @4747660/ <h> The Conditional in Spanish <p> Note : Some consider the conditional to be a " mood . " Others consider it to be an indicative tense . <p> As the name implies , the conditional is a verb conjugation used when some action is based upon some condition or somehow contingent on something else . This corresponds to the English use of the word " would . " For example , " What would you do ? " " I would leave immediately . " The conditional conjugations closely parallel those of the future tense . <h> Regular Conditional Verbs <p> As with the future tense , we do n't need to bother removing the " -ar , " " -er , " or " -ir " endings when conjugating in the conditional . We use the entire infinitive as our stem . And again , it does n't matter what kind of verb it is . Every verb uses these endings : <p> Note : Because the yo and Tl/ella/Ud. forms are identical , it 's a good idea to include a subject pronoun if the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -er " / " -ir " endings : <p> -fa <p> -famos <p> -fas <p> -fais <p> -fa <p> -fan <p> If those endings look familiar , they should . They 're exactly the same as the imperfect " -ir " verb endings . How can different tenses have the same endings ? Remember that here we 're adding them to the whole infinitive , not just the stem . <p> Some examples : <p> hablar : <p> comer : <p> vivir : <p> hablarfa <p> hablarfamos <p> hablarfas <p> hablarfais <p> hablarfa <p> hablarfan <p> comerfa <p> comerfamos <p> comerfas <p> comerfais <p> comerfa <p> comerfan <p> vivirfa <p> vivirfamos <p> vivirfas <p> vivirfais <p> vivirfa <p> vivirfan <p> Some more examples : <p> Nosotros trabajarfamos por tanto dinero.We would work for that much money . <p> T entenderfas ms que yo.You would understand more than I ( would ) . <p> Yo conducirfa el cami=n.I 'd drive the truck . <p> Notice that the English translations include the word " would " or a contraction of it . <p> The bad news : there are irregular conditional verbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as the irregular future verbs you already know . We just add the conditional ending to the same irregular stems : <p> Pay special attention to querer . The imperfect form of querer is " querfa . " The conditional form is " querrfa . " Notice the difference ? The only difference between saying " I wanted " and " I would want " is a rolled " r . " <p> " +Que harfa Reagan ? " <p> Some other examples : <p> +l tendrfa que estudiar mucho.He would have to study a lot . <p> Yo vendrfa ms temprano.I would come earlier . <p> No podrfan correr tan rapidamente.They would n't be able to run that quickly . <p> Note : The verb bendecir ( to bless ) does not follow the pattern of decir : bendecirfa , bendecirfas , etc . <p> Most verbs based on one of these irregular verbs will have a similar irregular conjugation . Take oponer and prevenir for example : <h> Other Uses of the Conditional <p> Ella estudiari ayer.She was probably studying yesterday . / She would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millas.They must have walked more than five miles . <p> Use the conditional to refer to the future from the point of view of the past . Consider these two sentences : <p> Pienso que regresarn en una hora.I think that they will return in one hour . <p> Pensaba que regresarfan en una hora.I thought that they would return in one hour . <p> Both sentences speculate about the future . The first sentence is set in the present and includes a future tense verb . The second sentence is set in the past and includes a conditional verb . This concept also comes in handy when reporting what someone said : <p> Ella dijo que traerfa las bebidas.She said that she would bring the drinks . <p> And lastly , the conditional is used to " soften " requests or desires in order to sound more polite : <p> +Podrfas traerme un vaso de agua ? Could you bring me a glass of water ? <p> Me gustarfa ir al cine contigo.I would like to go to the movies with you . <p> Podrfas and gustarfa are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit less demanding . <h> Things to Look Out For <p> Consider this sentence : <p> I would watch TV on Saturday mornings . <p> This looks like a textbook example of a conditional conjugation since you see the word " would . " But " would " does n't always mean that we use the conditional . The problem here is that the " would " is n't referring to any future hypothetical situation , but rather is indicating a habitual or repeated action in the past .

As you would expect , we use the present tense to describe a present action or how things currently are . In Spanish we can even use it to express actions in progress : <p> They live in Guatemala . I speak Spanish . We are eating dinner . <p> Here 's what you need to know about conjugating and using the present tense : <h> Stem Changing Present Tense Verbs <p> It would be nice if that were all there was to it , but the Spanish present tense is actually fairly complicated compared to other tenses . One of the first issues to discuss is a class of verbs known as " stem changing " verbs which do not follow the normal conjugation rules . As the name implies , the stems of these verbs change when they are conjugated . <p> One common stem changer is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would expect the stem to be " dorm " after removing the " -ir " ending . However , dormir is what 's known as an " o to ue " stem changer . That means we change the " o " to a " ue " whenever we conjugate in the present tense , and the stem becomes " duerm " . Check out the present tense conjugations of dormir : <p> dormir ( o ? ue ) : <p> duermo <p> dormimos <p> duermes <p> dormfs <p> duerme <p> duermen <p> Wait a minute , what 's going on with the nosotros and vosotros conjugations ? The stems of stem changing verbs do n't change for every subject ? nosotros ( we ) and vosotros ( you all ) conjugations remain the same . If you look at the pattern made by the stems in a typical conjugation grid , you can see the changed stems form the shape of a shoe or boot . Because of this , stem changing verbs are often called " boot verbs . " See ? <p> Note : When the stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stem change . When the stress falls on the ending , there is no change . <p> dormir ( o ? ue ) : <p> duermo <p> dormimos <p> duermes <p> dormfs <p> duerme <p> duermen <p> There are three kinds of stem changing verbs : o ? ue verbs , e ? ie verbs , and e ? i verbs . All of them are conjugated following the same boot verb pattern . <p> You can not just figure out whether a verb is a stem changer by looking at it . There are no hard and fast rules as to why certain verbs are stem changers . Your best bet is simply to memorize which verbs fall into which category . And remember , just because a stem has an " e " or an " o " in it does n't necessarily mean that it 's a stem changer . <h> Stem Changers : e ? ie <p> The following verbs are the most common e ? ie stem changers : <p> Note : Verbs based on these verbs will have the same stem changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Form Verbs <p> The list above is n't exhaustive ; it 's not even close . There are many other verbs with irregular yo form conjugations . In fact , there are so many that we put them into categories and do n't really treat them as being irregular . <h> Other Irregular Yo Form Verbs : " -go " Verbs <p> Several verbs have irregular yo form conjugations that end in " -go . " Hacer ( to make , to do ) is a good example : <p> hacer : <p> hago <p> hacemos <p> haces <p> hacTis <p> hace <p> hacen <p> Note : Verbs based on these irregular verbs will have the same irregularities , e.g. : detener ? detengo . <h> Twice Exceptional Verbs <p> Some verbs can actually be irregular in more than one way . Decir ( to say , to tell ) is just such a verb . It is both an e ? i stem changer and a " -go " verb .

However , you should be familiar with the following present tense conjugations before you get too much further . They are useful verbs and occur frequently : <p> Note : We typically would n't use the present tense in this way in English ; we 'd use the present progressive instead . It would be perfectly acceptable to write these sentences in Spanish using the present progressive , but we do n't have to . <p> Additionally , as in English , we can use the present to discuss things that will happen soon . <p> Voy al mTdico maana.I go to the doctor tomorrow . <p> Dewey derrota a Truman <p> And we can even talk about past events using the present tense to make a story seem more immediate and interesting . <p> Finalmente el general mueve sus tropas y ataca la ciudad del sur.Finally the general moves his troops and attacks the city from the south .

The first one is easy , " He visited the mountain . " The second one is a bit more difficult . It looks like , " He visited Isabel , " but what is the " a " there for ? The reason is a small but important rule in Spanish known as the personal a rule . <p> While it may not appear to be necessary , the second sentence needs to have an a before Isabel . Why ? Because two conditions are true : <p> One , Isabel is a person . OK , that 's easy enough . <p> Two , Isabel is a direct object . OK , what 's a direct object ? <p> *Note : technically speaking we should ask " whom ? " <p> You 'll learn more about objects later , but what you need to know now is that a direct object answers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of the verb in the sentence . To figure that out , simply read the sentence , stop after the verb , and ask yourself " who ? " or " what ? " He visited who* ? He visited Isabel . " Isabel " answers the question , " who ? " <p> Note : Do not confuse the personal a with the preposition a : Ella grit= a Pablo . ( She screamed at Pablo . ) <p> So we need to include a personal a in front of a direct object if that direct object is a person . We do not at an a in of a direct object that is not a person . ( The a does not get translated into English . ) <p> The formula looks something like this : <p> subject + verb + a + direct object ( person ) <p> Compare these examples : <p> AndrTsconoce bien ami prima.AndrTs knows my cousin well . <p> **28;110;TOOLONG saw Ronaldo . <p> Yoamoami novia.I love my girlfriend . <p> AndrTsconoce bien la ciudad.AndrTs knows the city well . <p> Hernandoviola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Let 's practice a little , shall we ? If we translated these sentences , which ones would need a personal a and where would it go ? <p> She drives a car . They know my brothers . We practice with the twins . I love my mother <p> Note : A personal a followed by an el will combine to form al:Yo conozco al maestro . <p> In the first sentence , " car " is a direct object , but it is not a person , therefore no personal a is necessary . In the second sentence , " brothers " is the direct object and they are people so we should use a personal a . In the third sentence , " twins " are people , but they are not a direct object because they do n't answer " who ? " or " what ? " ( " Twins " is actually part of a prepositional phrase that starts with the preposition " with . " ) In the last sentence , " mother " is a direct object and a person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note : If the answer to a question would require a personal a , the question should have one too . <p> When pronouns like alguno and ninguno refer to people , the personal a is used .

I do n't see any . <h> Exceptions to the Personal a Rule <h> Tener , Ser , and Haber <p> Even in sentences with a direct object who is a person , we typically do not use a personal a after the verbs tener , ser , or haber : <p> Yotengodos hermanos.I have two brothers . <p> Mi mejor amigoesmi primo.My best friend is my cousin . <p> Haymuchas personas allf.There are many people there . <p> However , at times , when we use tener in a sense of " to hold " or " to have in a specific place " we will use the personal a : <p> Por fin , ellatenfaasu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms . <p> +ltieneasu hijo en la cama.He has his son in bed . <h> Personified Objects <p> Sometimes things ( especially countries ) are treated as if they were people to show an emotional connection and therefore a personal a would be used : <p> Susanaextraa mucho aNicaragua.Susana misses Nicaragua a lot . <p> And even though they are not people , a personal a can be used with pets , especially if that pet is a beloved member of the family : <p> Nosotrosamamosanuestro perro.We love our dog . <h> Depersonified People <p> When the direct object refers to indefinite , non-specific , or anonymous people ( people with whom we do n't have an emotional connection ) , we do not need to use a personal a . In this situation the direct object has become depersonified ; it 's being treated more like an object than a person .

But as you 've doubtless seen already there are many instances where it 's much more complicated than that . Often one word in English could be translated two different ways in Spanish ( ser and estar for example ) and vice versa . Spanish prepositions are a trouble spot as many of them have two or more meanings in English . Perhaps the most notorious Spanish prepositions are por and para . They can both mean " for " and it 's not easy to know which one to use . Additionally , as you will see , they can both have other translations . Por and para can be difficult , but it 's also important to learn the proper usage of each word . <p> Para is used less often and has fewer rules to learn , so we 'll start there . <h> When to Use Para <p> Generally speaking para is the more specific of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opinions . <h> Specific Destination <p> Para is used to identify a specific destination : <p> Salgo para escuela ahora.I 'm leaving for school now . <p> Se van para Madrid.They 're leaving for Madrid . <h> Gift / Benefit <p> Para is used to identify the recipient of a gift or express that something is for someone else 's benefit : <p> El coche es para Ral.The car is for Ral .

While that information was accurate , we made it look easier than it actually was by glossing over a number of more complicated situations . Now that you 're a little older and wiser , it 's time to take a closer look at at some of these issues . <h> Spanish Nouns <h> Gender of Nouns <p> In Part 1 , we determined that nouns ending in " -o " were masculine and nouns ending in " -a " were feminine . There 's a couple of problems with this simple rule : it 's not always true , and there are numerous nouns which do n't end with " -o " or " -a . " <h> Imposters <p> First of all , some words are imposters . For instance , moto and foto ( " motorcycle " and " photograph " ) both end in " -o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foto . There 's a good reason for it . Moto and foto are actually abbreviations of motocicleta and fotograffa . Another example is la disco , short for la discoteca . <h> Rule Breakers <p> There are also numberous words which break the " -o " and " -a " rules . The following is a list of common trouble makers : <p> Note : Most of the rule breakers are masculine words ending in " -a " . <p> el cometa ( comet ) el dfa ( day ) <p> la mano ( hand ) el mapa ( map ) <p> el planeta ( planet ) el sof ( sofa , couch ) <p> A substantial number of the words that break the gender rules end in " -ma .

This is true of both definite and indefinite articles . <p> Note : Since the letter " h " is n't pronounced in Spanish , ha = a . <p> el agua el guila el hada <p> not:la aguanot:la guilanot:la hada <p> un agua un guila un hada <p> not:una aguanot:una guilanot:una hada <p> Note : This is the equivalent of using " an " instead of " a " in English : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> However , when these nouns are plural , the double a situation does n't exist so we revert back to the feminine article . <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> el agua el guila el hada <p> las aguas las guilas las hadas <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> un agua un guila un hada <p> unas aguas unas guilas unas hadas <p> Remember that regardless of the article used , these are still feminine nouns which require feminine adjectives . <p> This rule does not apply to nouns that begin with an unstressed a because they 're easier to pronounce . <p> la artillerfa , la agricultura , una avenida <h> When to Use Definite and Indefinite Articles <p> Figuring out when to use articles in Spanish can be a bewildering task for an English speaker .

There 's also a neuter ( non-gender ) article , lo . How is it used ? Lo can be combined with a masculine singular adjective to create an abstract noun . English translations usually involve the words , " thing " or " part " : <p> Lo mejor fue el final.The best part was the ending . <p> Lo bueno es que no hay tarea.What 's good is that there 's no homework . <p> Lo ms importante es ser sincero.The most important thing is to be sincere . <h> Spanish Adjectives <h> Adjectives Forms <p> In part 1 we learned that adjectives have four forms based on the gender ( masculine or feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nouns they modify .

Not every adjective has four forms . Some only have only two forms , singular and plural . These adjectives are known as " invariable " adjectives because they do n't change with gender . Many of these adjectives end in " -a " ( like azteca , indfgena , marina , maya , and violeta ) . And " -ista " adjectives ( like comunista , deportista , optimista , pesimista , realista , etc. ) are invariable too . For example :

They are pronouns because they simplify the sentence by taking the place of a noun and eliminating repetition . For example : <p> Bumblebee is a robot . The robot becomes a car .

" <p> While que can refer to just about anything , quien may only refer to people and is translated " who " or " whom .

For example : <p> La primera secci=n del examen , que es muy diffcil , se trata de gramtica.The first section of the test , which is very difficult , is grammar . <p> In this sentence it 's not apparent whether the entire test is difficult or just the first section . While we ca n't do anything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Notice how each relative pronoun indicates a different antecedent . <p> El que a hierro mata , a hierro muereThe one who kills by iron , dies by iron . ( He who lives by the sword , dies by the sword . ) <p> Quien vacila est perdido.He who hesitates is lost . <h> Lo Que / Lo Cual <p> In order to use a form of el que or el cual we need to know the gender and number of the antecedent . Sometimes this is impossible , however , because the antecedent is unknown or it is an abstract concept which does n't have gender or number . In these cases we would use the neuter forms lo que and lo cual . <p> In this sentence the antecedent is n't the price or the oil , but rather the idea that oil prices rose quickly . The fact that oil prices rose rapidly does not have a number or a gender so we use the neuter lo cual for our relative pronoun . <h> Cuyo <p> One situation in which we can not use que @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the relative pronoun " whose . " For that we use cuyo . There are four forms of cuyo , so we need to make sure the pronoun agrees in gender and in number with its antecedent . <p> Please note in the examples above , the form of cuyo does not agree with the subject of the sentence , but rather with its antecedent . In the first sentence the student is feminine , but it 's her ( masculine ) arm that is being referred to , so we use cuyo . In the second sentence the student is masculine , but cuya agrees with his ( feminine ) backpack . In the third sentence the singer is a man , but his ( feminine ) songs are the antecedent , therefore we use cuyas . <h> De QuiTn / De QuiTnes <p> If you 're asking a " whose " question , use de quiTn . Use de quiTnes if you expect the answer to be plural : <p> +De quiTn es este libro ? Whose book is this ? <p> +De quiTnes son estos coches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cuando ( when ) and donde ( where ) can also function as relative pronouns . In this case we 're stating " when " and " where , " rather than asking . For example : <p> El verano , cuando no tengo clases , trabajarT.In the summer , when I do n't have classes , I will work .

@@100547680 @4747680/ <h> The Present Subjunctive : When ? ( Part 1 ) <p> If you 've made it this far , you 're probably feeling pretty good about Spanish . You 've learned a lot of vocabulary and know how to conjugate in the past , present , and future . You can understand and speak enough Spanish to get by . But all along a grammatical nightmare has been lurking in the shadows just waiting to jump out and make your life miserable : the subjunctive . <p> The subjunctive can be a difficult , complicated , and non-intuitive concept for an English speaker . It 's at this point that many Spanish students decide it 's just not worth it and bail out . But stick with it . It 's an important aspect of the language . ( Also , the people who make entrance exams and advanced placement exams love to test the subjunctive . ) <p> The first thing you need to know about the subjunctive is that it is a " mood . " <p> Note : There are three moods ( modos ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjunctive ( subjuntivo ) , and the imperative ( imperativo ) . <h> What is a Mood ? <p> Your teacher never bothered to tell you this , but all those verb conjugations you 've been learning they 've just been one of two ways of conjugating . Everything you 've learned about verbs to this point has been in something called the " indicative mood . " What 's a mood ? A mood is a special way of conjugating a verb in order to expresses your attitude toward the situation . <p> As its name implies , the indicative mood indicates reality or concrete facts . You have n't had to worry about the moods before because up until now , you 've primarily been using simple sentences about factual situations : Me llamo Pepe . T cocinas bien . Tengo un coche peligroso . <p> But as you progress , you 'll begin using more complex sentence structures and the more likely it is you 'll need to use another mood , the subjunctive . The subjunctive mood is used to convey desire , express doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dudo que t cocines bien . Necesito un coche que sea ms seguro . <p> While a mood may look a lot like a tense , they 're not the same thing . A tense has to do with the timeframe of the verb . A mood has to do with the speaker 's attitude toward the verb . Most verb conjugations are actually a combination of tense ( time ) and mood ( attitude ) . <p> Before you start complaining again about how needlessly complicated Spanish is , be aware that we use the subjunctive in English too . It 's not done well , or consistently , but there are situations in English in which we should use a different verb conjugations than we otherwise would . Consider the differences in the following sentence pairs : She arrives on time . ? It 's necessary that she arrive on time . I am handsome . ? I wish I were handsome . He cooks dinner . ? I demand that he cook dinner . <p> There are many situations in which the subjunctive is required but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That will be a good start for intermediate Spanish students . Advanced Spanish students should continue on to The Present Subjunctive : When ? ( Part 2 ) . <h> The Present Subjunctive in Dependent Clauses <p> Most of the time , the subjunctive appears in dependent clauses ( sometimes called subordinate clauses ) . What 's a clause ? Generally speaking a clause includes a subject and a predicate ( verb ) . A clause can be a complete sentence all by itself : <p> He plays soccer . <p> Or clauses can be combined to form larger sentences : <p> I know that he plays soccer . <p> Rene Descartes , author of the most famous independent / dependent clause combination . <p> Independent clauses ( also known as main clauses ) are clauses which can stand on their own when removed from the larger sentence : <p> I think therefore I am . <p> Dependent clauses usually begin with conjunctions like " therefore , " " that , " " so that , " " before , " etc . Dependent clauses depend on or expand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> I think therefore I am . <p> Got it so far ? Good . Now we 're going to look at our first type of dependent clause , the noun clause , to see when we should use the subjunctive . <h> The Present Subjunctive in Noun Clauses <p> Consider this sentence : <p> I demand a car ! <p> Here , " a car " is a noun ( which happens to be functioning as a direct object ) . Now consider this sentence : <p> I demand that you respect me ! <p> This time around the clause " that you respect me " is also functioning like a noun just as " a car " did in the previous sentence . Therefore it 's known as a noun clause . <h> The Present Subjunctive in Noun Clauses : Volition <p> Volition is a fancy word for " willing . " It carries the idea that someone is asking , hoping , insisting , demanding , suggesting , recommending , telling , requiring , etc. someone else to do something . Any time we see an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the subjunctive in the dependent clause . The reason for this is that sentence is not simply stating a fact , but trying to influence an outcome ( which may or may not happen ) . The general formula we 're looking for is : <p> And do n't get carried away and start conjugating every second verb in the subjunctive . If there is no volition , use the indicative : <p> Yo sT que t haces tu tarea.I know that you do your homework . <h> Issues with Decir <p> Decir is a tricky verb in that it can signal both the indicative and the subjunctive . Which mood to use depends on the context . If decir is used to state a fact , the dependent clause should be in the indicative : <p> Me dice que toco bien.He tells me that I play well . <p> If decir is used more like a command , the dependent clause should be in the subjunctive : <p> Me dice que toque bien.He tells me to play well . <h> The Present Subjunctive in Noun Clauses : Doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ( or negates ) the dependent clause , we must use the subjunctive . We do this because the sentence is n't stating facts , but rather suggesting that something is not true . The general formula we 're looking for is : <p> subject + doubt verb + " que " + different subject + subjunctive verb <p> For example : <p> Note : It is n't necessary for the subject to be a person . Impersonal expressions such as es improbable , es imposible , es dudable , etc. require the subjunctive too . <p> Est segura que conduce un coche verde . She is sure that he drives a green car . <p> The verbs pensar and creer indicate certainty : <p> +l cree que ella canta en el coro . He believes that she sings in the choir . <p> Whether or not the dependent clause is actually true is irrelevant . The independent clause tells us which mood to use : <p> +l piensa que el sol es un planeta . He thinks that the sun is a planet . <h> The Present Subjunctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes any emotion , use the subjunctive in the dependent clause . The reason for this is that even though the sentence may be stating a fact , it is also expressing a judgment or personal reaction to the situation . The formula is : <p> subject + emotion verb + " que " + different subject + subjunctive verb <p> For example : <p> Note : It is n't necessary for the subject to be a person . Impersonal expressions such as es triste and es una lstima require the subjunctive too . <p> Me molesta que t no escuches.It bothers me that you are not listening . <p> Est enojada que yo estT aquf . She is angry that I am here . <p> Es triste que haya tantos robos.It 's sad that there are so many thefts . <h> Things to Watch Out For <p> Any verb that expresses a feeling , judgment , or opinion , even if it do n't necessarily sound " emotional , " requires the subjunctive . This includes gustar , sentir , sorprender , etc. : 
@@100547683 @4747683/ <h> The Imperfect ( Past ) Subjunctive : When ? <p> Remember that the subjunctive is n't a tense ; it 's a mood . That means that when to use it is determined by the situation , not by the timeframe . So for the most part , all the reasons we learned to use the subjunctive in the present tense apply to the past as well . <p> Now before you have flashbacks to the nightmare of learning the difference between the imperfect and the preterite , a bit of good news ; there is no " preterite subjunctive . " Any time you need to use the subjunctive mood in the past tense , you will use the imperfect subjunctive ( sometimes called the " past subjunctive " ) . <p> Yo dudaba que ella supiera tocar el saxof=n.I doubted that she knew how to play the saxophone . <p> Ella estuvo feliz que Tl fuera al baile.She was happy that he went to the dance . <h> The Imperfect Subjunctive in Adjective Clauses <p> In determining whether to use the subjunctive or the indicative in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is the antecedent definite or indefinite ? " We 'll ask the same question when dealing with the past tense . If the antecedent was concrete , we use the indicative ( either preterite or imperfect ) . If it was non-specific , we use the imperfect subjunctive . <p> The following sentences in the present tense <p> Tengo un libro que se trata de negocios.I have a book that is about business . <p> Necesito un libro que me interese.I need a book that interests me . <p> Become these in the past : <p> Tenfa un libro que se trataba de negocios.I had a book that was about business . <p> Iba a pagarte tan pronto comorecibiera el dinero.I was going to pay you as soon as I recieved the money . <h> So Which Tense Do I Use ? <p> So , are you thoroughly confused yet ? The following chart may help . Generally speaking the tense in the main clause determines the tense of the dependent clause : <p> Tense : <p> Independent Clause : <p> Dependent Clause : <p> present future present perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exigido que Exige que <p> hagan su tarea . <p> imperfect preterite pluperfect <p> +l exigfa que +l exigi= que +l habfa exigido que <p> hicieran su tarea . <p> However , in some situations it is also possible to match the present tense with the past : <p> Dudo que llegaran a tiempo.I doubt that they arrived on time . <p> Espero que ganaran el partido.I hope that they won the game . <h> The Imperfect Subjunctive in Hypothetical Situations <p> Note : Sf ( with the accent ) means " yes . " <p> If all of the information above has n't convinced you of the need to learn the imperfect subjunctive , this might . We use the imperfect subjunctive when we talk about things that are hypothetical or contrary to fact . The imperfect subjunctive commonly appears in si clauses ( si means " if " ) combined with an independent clause that contains a conditional verb . <p> " If I were a boy . " BeyoncT gets high marks for grammar . <p> " If I was a rich girl . " Gwen Stefani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good example of one of the rare instances we use ( or more accuarately , should use ) the subjunctive in English . We often say things like , " If I was older , " " If I was president , " " If I was a millionaire , " etc . But we should actually be saying , " If I were older , " " If I were president , " etc . The subjunctive here indicates that we 're using our imaginations and not talking about reality . <p> Some Spanish examples : <p> Si yo fuera maestro , nunca darfa exmenes.If I were a teacher , I would never give tests . <p> As you can see , it does n't matter whether the si clause starts the sentence or appears later . It is important , however , that the imperfect subjunctive verb appears together with the si . That 's the hypothetical part . The conditional ( " would " ) part of the sentence needs a conditional verb ( obviously ) . <h> Other Uses of the Imperfect Subjunctive <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences with como si : <p> Habla como si fuera rey del mundo ! He talks as if he were king of the world ! <p> We can use the imperfect subjunctive in sentences with ojal or ojal que : <p> Ojal que entendiera matemticas ! Oh , I wish I understood math ! <p> And we can use the imperfect subjunctive as a substitute for the present tense or the conditional with verbs like poder , querer , and deber in order to soften the request or express courtesy : 
@@100547687 @4747687/ <h> Spanish Commands ( the Imperative Mood ) <p> As you get better and better at Spanish ( and the more contact you have with Spanish speakers ) it becomes more and more likely that you 'll need to tell someone to do something . This is a command and it requires it 's own special conjugation . ( Command conjugations are also known as the " imperative " mood . ) <p> When this guy gives commands , people follow them ( or people die ) . <p> Thinking of a command as being a conjugation is a hard concept to grasp for the average English speaker . We do n't need to conjugate a verb . We just change the inflection in our voices in order to tell someone to do something . For example : <p> subject : <p> command : <p> You ( singular ) <p> Leave ! <p> You ( plural ) <p> Leave ! <p> We <p> Let 's leave ! <p> Here subject refers to the person being commanded . In English we only have three options ; the singular " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we . " We do n't differentiate between a formal and an informal " you " like we do in Spanish . ( The exclamation point is n't really necessary for a command to be a command but it does help for demonstration purposes . ) <p> Spanish commands on the other hand are very complex because we have a separate verb conjugation for each subject and we have more subjects due to our distinction between formal and informal . Here are all the subject possibilities for Spanish commands in our familiar chart : <p> -- <p> nosotros <p> t <p> vosotros <p> usted <p> ustedes <p> You 'll notice that there is no command corresponding to yo . This is because you simply ca n't command " I " to do something . Likewise there is no Tl , ella , ellos , or ellas because we ca n't command " he , " " she , " or " they " to do something . All the commands are either first person plural , or second person . <h> Usted and Ustedes Commands <p> Usted and ustedes commands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of people with whom you have a formal or respectful relationship to do something . These commands are a good place to start because they 're the easiest and also because it 's better to treat someone as usted when you 're supposed to use t than the other way around . Also , outside of Spain ( where vosotros is used ) , the only way to command a group of people is to use an ustedes command . <h> Affirmative Usted and Ustedes Commands <p> To change a verb into an affirmative usted or ustedes command simply use the appropriate subjunctive conjugation : <p> hablar : <p> correr : <p> repetir : <p> usted : <p> hable <p> corra <p> repita <p> ustedes : <p> hablen <p> corran <p> repitan <p> There are no irregular usted or ustedes commands . However , there are many irregular subjunctive conjugations that would be useful to remember . A few or them : <p> dar : <p> ser : <p> ir : <p> usted : <p> dT <p> sea <p> vaya <p> ustedes : <p> den <p> sean <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ustedes commands are easy to change into negative commands ( where you tell someone not to do something ) . Simply add no : <h> T Form Commands <p> T form commands are commands which you would use when telling a friend or equal to do something . They are considerably more difficult than usted and ustedes commands for three reasons : first , they use a form that seems unnatural for a t conjugation ; second , they have a number of irregular conjugations ; and third , the negative form is completely different from the regular ( affirmative ) form . <h> Affirmative T Form Commands <p> It seems very strange , but to conjugate an affirmative t command , we 're actually going to use the indicative Tl/ella/usted form ( not the t form ) of the verb : <p> hablar : <p> correr : <p> repetir : <p> hablo <p> hablamos <p> hablas <p> hablis <p> habla <p> hablan <p> corro <p> corremos <p> corres <p> corrTis <p> corre <p> corren <p> repito <p> repetimos <p> repites <p> repetfs <p> repite <p> repiten <p> So how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usted command uses the subjunctive form , the t form command uses the indicative . Here 's a chart of both for comparison purposes : <p> hablar : <p> correr : <p> repetir : <p> t : <p> habla <p> corre <p> repite <p> usted : <p> hable <p> corra <p> repita <p> As you can see , there is usually only a difference of one letter between an usted command and a t command . ( The difference between a polite apology and an insult is the difference between perd=neme and perd=name . ) <p> There are eight irregular affirmative t commands . And as you might expect with irregulars , they are fairly common verbs : <p> decir : <p> hacer : <p> ir : <p> poner : <p> salir : <p> ser : <p> tener : <p> venir : <p> di <p> haz <p> ve <p> pon <p> sal <p> sT <p> ten <p> ven <p> After you learn these , do n't get fooled into thinking that the rule for conjugating is to shorten the verb to one syllable . These are only the irregular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( affirmative ) t commands into negative ones is more difficult than changing usted and ustedes commands . In addition to adding a no , we 're going to conjugate the verb in the subjunctive t form . <p> hablar : <p> correr : <p> repetir : <p> hable <p> hablemos <p> hables <p> hablTis <p> hable <p> hablen <p> corra <p> corramos <p> corras <p> corris <p> corra <p> corran <p> repita <p> repitamos <p> repitas <p> repitis <p> repita <p> repitan <p> So how do affirmative and negative t form commands compare ? Here are some examples : <p> hablar : <p> correr : <p> repetir : <p> affirmative : <p> habla <p> corre <p> repite <p> negative : <p> no hables <p> no corras <p> no repitas <p> There are no irregular negative t form commands , however there are many irregular subjunctive conjugations such as : <h> Vosotros Commands <p> Vosotros commands are commands given to a group of friends or equals . They are primarily used in Spain . In other parts of the Spanish-speaking world , ustedes commands are used instead ( regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vosotros commands are a bit complicated . To form an affirmative vosotros command , we 're going to do something simple but unusual : replace the " -r " at the end of the infinitive with a " -d . " To form a negative vosotros command , simply use the subjunctive and a no : <p> hablar : <p> correr : <p> repetir : <p> affirmative : <p> hablad <p> corred <p> repetid <p> negative : <p> no hablTis <p> no corris <p> no repitis <p> Since the affirmative commands all end in " d , " now would be a good time to refresh your memory on correctly pronouncing a " d " in Spanish . Remember that it is pronounced much softer in Spanish than it is in English , almost like a " th . " When pronouncing the " d " place your tongue on your upper teeth rather than the roof of your mouth . <h> Using Object Pronouns with Commands <p> Pronouns have some special rules when being used along with commands . The basic rule is that any pronoun needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in front of a negative command . Consider the command , " Tell me ! " The verb we will use is decir and me is our indirect object pronoun : <p> If you look closely , you may have noticed that some accent marks suddenly appeared in the affirmative usted and ustedes commands . These are not typos . We do n't want to change the natural pronunciation of our command ( diga and digan ) even though we 're adding a syllable to it . To preserve the original stress , we write an accent mark on the vowel that would be stressed if there were n't an object attached . The " i " in dime does not need an accent mark because even with the object attached , the stress still falls in the proper place ( See more on Accent Marks &amp; Special Characters ) . <p> The same rules apply for commands with both indirect and direct object pronouns . Consider the command , " Tell it to me ! " In addition to our IOP , " me , " we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Since we 're not sure what " it " refers to , we 'll use lo . ) : <p> t form : <p> usted form : <p> ustedes form : <p> affirmative : <p> dfmelo <p> dfgamelo <p> dfganmelo <p> negative : <p> nomelodigas <p> nomelodiga <p> nomelodigan <p> This time we ca n't avoid using an accent mark on the t form command , because now we 're adding two syllables to the di . <p> The same rules apply to nosotros and vosotros commands . Consider the commands , " Let 's do it ! " and " Do it ! " ( as well as their negative counterparts ) : <p> nosotros form : <p> vosotros form : <p> affirmative : <p> hagmoslo <p> hcedlo <p> negative : <p> nolohagamos <p> nolohagis <h> Using Reflexive Pronouns with Commands <p> Occasionally we 'll want to use a reflexive verb as a command . The reflexive pronouns follow the same pattern as object pronouns . Let 's look at alegrarse ( to be happy ) in command form ( we 'll look at the negatives as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The nosotros and vosotros commands are slightly different when using a reflexive pronoun . To make pronunciation a bit easier , we 're going to drop the " -s " from the affirmative nosotros command and the " -d " from the affirmative vosotros command before adding the reflexive pronoun . The negative commands are unaffected : <p> nosotros form : <p> vosotros form : <p> affirmative : <p> alegrTmonos <p> alegraos <p> negative : <p> nonosalegremos <p> noosalegrTis <p> Nosotros command form of the verb Obamar . <p> One exception to the last rule is the verb irse . The vosotros command form retains the " d " : idos . Also , reflexive " -ir " verbs require you to add an accent mark in the vosotros form :

You killed my father " <p> Spanish speakers also tend to have more " first names " than English speakers . This can be for a variety of reasons . Traditionally , many Hispanic children were named after saints , especially the patron saint of their birthday . More names were then added in honor of other saints ( thereby increasing divine protection ) or to honor other relatives . Many traditional names ( like " Ana " ) are so popular that a second ( or third ) name is included to avoid any confusion ( e.g. " Ana Marfa " vs . " Ana Lucfa " ) . <p> There is a huge variety of Spanish first names just as there is in English . Many names ( especially Biblical ones ) have English equivalents ( JosT = Joseph , Marfa = Mary , Juan = John , Miguel = Michael , Mateo = Matthew , etc . ) . Many names ( especially indigenous ones ) can not be translated ( e.g. Xochil , Ximena ) . Names that would be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all in another . And sometimes Hispanic people have names that just seem out of place , like " Jessica , " " Giovanni , " " Vladimir " or even " Lenin . " <p> Now would be a good time to note that even if a Spanish name has an English equivalent , you should n't translate it : " JosT Reyes " does not become " Joseph Kings . " <p> Note : Due to their religious significance , it 's not unusual for a girl to have " JosT " as a second name or for a boy 's name to include " Marfa , " e.g. JosT Marfa Aznar . <h> More on Hispanic Names <h> Spanish Middle Names <p> Spanish does not use a " middle name " per se , but rather the second first name ( " segundo nombre " ) is considered the middle name when filling out paperwork . <h> Spanish Titles <p> Note : In the past the term Seorito ( Srto. ) was used for a young , unmarried man . Now it 's a pejorative term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles are very similar to English with one exception . Don is used as sign of respect for an important or wealthy man . This loosely translates to " Sir " in English . The female equivalent is doa . <p> English : <p> Spanish : <p> abbrev. : <p> Mr. Mrs. Ms. Sir Lady Dr. <p> seor seora seorita don doa doctor(-a) <p> Sr. Sra . Srta . D. Da . Dr. / Dra . <p> Notice that Spanish titles are not capitalized but their abbreviations are . <p> Leo " La Pulga At=mica ' " Messi <h> Spanish Nicknames <p> Just as in English , many Spanish speakers receive nicknames ( whether they want them or not ) . Some people are given nicknames ( or " apodos " ) based on ancestry ( e.g. Chino = " Chinese guy , " Ruso = " the Russian " ) , or personal characteristics ( e.g. Gusano = " the worm , " Maquina = " the machine , " Clavo = " nail " ) . In Sandra Cisneros ' book , Caramelo , a character is nicknamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . <h> Spanish Name Suffixes <p> If English speaking parents want to name their son after his father it 's necessary to include a suffix ( like " junior , " " the second , " or " II " ) . This is n't actually necessary for Spanish speaking parents . Since the mother 's maiden name becomes part of the child 's last name , it 's not possible for a father and son to share the exact same full name . <p> However , to avoid confusion Hispanics may use the diminutive to refer to the child ( e.g. " Juancito Garcfa " ) or they may even borrow from English and call the child " junior " ( pronounced " yunior " ) . Hispanics may also add " segundo " to the name ( e.g. " Juan Garcfa , segundo " ) or refer to father and son as " padre " and " hijo " ( e.g. " Juan Garcfa , padre " and " Juan Garcfa , hijo " ) .

It is the second-most spoken language in the United States ( spoken by over 30 million people ) and it is a very popular language to study in U.S. schools . <p> Spanish is one of the easier languages for native English speakers to learn thanks to regular grammar , consistent pronunciation , and a large number of similar words sharing Latin origins . <p> Speaking of Latin , learning Spanish can help improve your vocabulary because many terms relating to math , science , law , medicine , and theology originated in Latin , and Spanish is one of Latin 's closest living relatives . <p> World travellers find Spanish a very useful language as it gives them access to a large number of countries and an enormous geographic area , most of the Western Hemisphere , in fact . <p> Spanish also is a great starting point for learning other romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations . <h> Espaol or Castellano ? <p> It is n't entirely accurate to use the term " Spanish " to refer to the language of Spain . Spaniards speak many distinct languages and dialects including Aranese , Basque , Catalan , and Galician . The official language of Spain ( spoken by 99% of the population as a first or second language ) is actually known as castellano ( Castilian ) because it originated in the Castilla ( Castile ) region of Spain . <p> You can use the term espaol to refer to a person from Spain , but you 're better off using castellano to refer to the language he speaks . Even some countries in Latin America will refer to their language as castellano rather than espaol . <h> What is the Best Way to Learn Spanish ? <p> Two words : Total . Immersion .

You 'll also have the benefit of experiencing the culture first-hand . Many colleges and universities offer semester abroad programs aimed at a teaching foreign languages . There are also many language schools in Latin America for those who can afford to spend a few weeks or months living outside the United States . <p> Traveling not going to work out ? The advantage of total immersion is that English is n't an option , but you do n't necessarily have to move to get good practice . Find a local language program with native speakers who will push you to hear and speak Spanish . Find a conversation partner or group where English is n't allowed .

Yes , grammar is important , but correctly conjugating verbs wo n't get you very far if you do n't know any other words to add to the sentence . <h> Is Spanish the Same the World Over ? <p> No . Not even close . While it would be very nice to learn a language that was totally consistent from one country to the next , the truth is that you will experience some major differences traveling from one Spanish-speaking country to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One prime example is the vosotros conjugation which is used almost exclusively in Spain while the rest of the Spanish-speaking world uses ustedes . There are also some key differences in pronunciation and vocabulary . For example , several regions in Spain pronounce " c " and " z " with a slight lisp ( e.g. " Valencia " sounds more like " Valenthia " ) . A computer might be referred to as an ordenador in Spain whereas elsewhere it would be called a computadora . But even Latin American countries can vary greatly from each other . <p> " Coche " or " Carro " ? <p> Central Americans have a tendency to drop the " -s " at the end ( and sometimes even in the middle ! ) of words when speaking , and they also use a ( rarely taught ) vos conjugation when talking with close friends . Vocabulary is also an issue between Latin American countries . A car can be a coche on one side of the border and a carro on the other . And there is a seemingly endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chancho , cochino , marrano , etc . Much of this variety can be attributed to the history of each country . Some regions have close ties with Spain and Europe and are therefore influenced by languages like French and Portuguese . Countries with closer ties to the United States ( like Mexico ) have been influenced greatly by ( American ) English . Many countries in Latin America use words adopted from indigenous cultures . And every country has their own set of slang words and idiomatic expressions that wo n't make much sense elsewhere . <p> Most Spanish curriculums ( as well as this website ) try to present a " generic " or international version of Spanish which will be useful in a majority of places and situations . By the way , the country of Spain considers itself to be the official keeper of the Spanish language which is known as Castellano ( " Castillian " in English ) . <p> If you find it upsetting that Spanish is so different from one place to the next , English is really no different . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flashlight is a " torch , " an elevator is a " lift , " and french fries are " chips . " In fact , George Bernard Shaw once wrote that " England and America are two countries divided by a common language . " <p> While we 're on the subject <h> What 's the Deal with Vos ( Voseo ) ? <p> Note : Due to the fact that " v " and " b " are pronounced nearly identically in Spanish , vos can sound more like " bos " in conversation . <p> In some Spanish speaking countries ( especially in Central America and the southern cone of South America ) there is another second-person , singular pronoun in addition to t and usted . It 's vos . And this phenomenon is known as voseo . <p> Vos is not just a shortening of vosotros or an object pronoun ( like nos ) ; it functions as a subject pronoun . Vos is used for very informal situations such as between close friends . In some places vos is used together with t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or t becomes more formal and usted is n't used . The vos has its own set of rules for conjugations . <p> Argentina beats to your rhythm . <p> Vos conjugations sound like t conjugations with the accent shifted to the last syllable . The rule you should follow is to remove the " -r " from the infinitive , replace it with an " -s " and add an accent to the preceeding vowel . Compare tform and vos conjugations : <p> verb : <p> t form : <p> vos form : <p> comer dar decir estar hablar poder ser venir vivir <p> comes das dices ests hablas puedes eres vienes vives <p> comTs ds decfs ests habls podTs sos venfs vivfs <p> As you can see from this small sample , stem changing verbs do not change in the vos form , some verbs are exactly the same in the vos , and some verbs are completely irregular ( of course ) . <p> To form a vos command , you will usually remove the final " -s " from the conjugation : comer ? comT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> What Does Se Mean ? <h> What 's the Deal with Haber ? <p> Actually the word haber does n't appear in Spanish all that often but its conjugations do , and they can cause some confusion . Haber is a strange verb that , when used by itself , does n't really have an English translation ; the closest we can get is " to be " in the sense of " to exist . " It 's easier to see what it means after we conjugate it . In the present tense , haber is conjugated hay , " there is " or " there are . " <p> Haber has a limited set of conjugations . There is only one conjugation in each tense : the third person singular form . You ca n't conjugate haber in the yo form or the t form , for example , because you ca n't say things like " I there is , " or " You there are . " But haber can be conjugated in other tenses ( and moods ) . Some examples : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aruba got its name from the Spanish oro hubo , meaning " there was gold . " <p> Haber can also be used as an auxiliary verb together with a past participle to form perfect tenses ( present perfect , pluperfect , future perfect , etc . ) When used this way , it means " to have " ( as in , " to have seen , " " to have done , " " to have written , " etc. ) and it has a complete set of conjugations . ( See Perfect Tenses for a complete breakdown of haber conjugations . ) <p> There are also some of common idiomatic expressions that involve " haber " : <p> Habfa una vez <p> No hay de quT . <p> +QuT hay ? / +QuT hay de nuevo ? <p> QuT hubo ! or Quihbole ! <p> Once upon a time <p> Do n't mention it . Think nothing of it . <p> What 's happening ? / What 's new ? <p> Hi ! What 's happening ? <p> Using a form of haber together with que @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important : <p> Hay que comer mucha fruta . It is necessary to eat a lot of fruit . / You got ta eat a lot of fruit . <p> Habr que salir muy temprano . It will be necessary to leave very eary. / You 'll have to leave very early . <h> What 's The Deal With Puerto Rico <p> Puerto Rico 's Flag <p> Puerto Rico , an island in the Caribbean , has a unique , complicated , and often misunderstood relationship with the United States . When Columbus set foot on Puerto Rico in 1493 the island became part of the Spanish empire . The Spanish conquistadores quickly enslaved the indigenous population who were nearly decimated by disease and brutal working conditions . There were various attempts to gain independence from Spain over the next 400 years , but in 1898 , as an outcome of the Spanish American war , Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States ( along with Cuba , Guam , and the Philippines ) . It became a U.S. territory . Since that time the U.S. has granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of laws and acts ( most notable the Jones-Shafroth Act in 1917 ) . And as it stands now , Puerto Rico is " commonwealth " of the United States . The Spanish term is for this is " Estado Libre Asociado " which translates , " Free Associated State . " <p> or Puerto Rico 's Flag ? <p> Here 's where it gets complicated . Puerto Rico is not a U.S. territory or U.S. state , but Puerto Ricans are all U.S. citizens . ( They do n't need passports to travel to and from the U.S. ) Puerto Ricans do not have to pay Federal taxes , but they can be drafted into in the U.S. military and they can not vote in Federal elections . <p> So how do Puerto Ricans feel about all of this ? There is a group in favor of becoming completely independent from the U.S. ; a group in favor of status quo ; and there is a group in favor of becoming the 51st state of the Union . In 2012 , 54% of Puerto Ricans voted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term " Puerto Rican " can also be a confusing one . " Puerto Rican " can refer to a permanent resident of the island of Puerto Rico as well as to someone who has emigrated from the island to the U.S. It can also be used to refer to anyone living anywhere who simply has Puerto Rican ancestry . <h> How Do You Say " I Have Been Studying for Hours " ? <p> A present perfect continuous conjugation like , " I have been studying for hours , " or , " We have been driving for days , " is a good example of why you should n't try to translate certain Spanish expressions one word at a time . If you did , you 'd end up with something like " Yo he estado estudiando por horas . " While you would probably be understood , there is a better way to say it in Spanish . You 're going to say something a lot more like " It makes hours that I study . " The formula is this : <p> We can also write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " have " becomes a " had . " In Spanish we simply change both of our verbs from the present tense to the imperfect tense . Now you 're saying something more like " It made hours that I studied , " and the formula is this : <h> How Do You Say " That " in Spanish ? <p> Finding the right word for " that " can be challenging because " that " can function in five different ways : as a conjunction or relative pronoun , as a demonstrative adjective , as a demonstrative pronoun , or as an adverb . Which Spanish word you chose depends on its function . <p> +se , Tsa , aquTl and aquTlla can also be used as demonstrative pronouns , meaning " that " or " that one " : <p> +sa es mi naranja.That is my orange . <p> AquTlla es de Juan.That one ( over there ) belongs to Juan . <p> There are also gender neutral or " neuter " pronouns for referring to concepts without gender , eso and aquello : <p> Eso me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that " can be an adverb modifying an adjective . In Spanish we use the word tan : <p> Toms no es tan inteligente.Toms is not that smart . <h> How Do You Say " Um " in Spanish ? <p> Spanish speakers do n't say " um " but they do use filler words when they have to pause to think about what to say next . Every region has its own unique manner of speaking but there are a few common common Spanish words that work the same way that " um " does in English . <p> Hispanics will often start a response with pues , entonces , or bueno to buy themselves some time to think . All of them translate to " well " : 
@@100547692 @4747692/ <h> Conjugating Verbs <p> A large amount of learning Spanish deals with " conjugations . " Conjugating is taking a verb and making it agree with the subject . In English we do it all the time without even thinking about it . Take a sentence with " John " as a subject and " to have " as a verb : <p> Johnhas a ladder . <p> In order for the subject and verb to agree , we need to change our verb , " to have , " into " has . " It sounds funny when a verb is conjugated incorrectly : <p> Ihas a ladder . <p> Poor verb conjugation was just one of the XFL 's many problems . <p> In order to agree with the subject , " to have " obviously should have been conjugated as " have . " <p> Before we get into verb conjugations , let 's look at our six possible subjects : I , you , he , she , it , we , you all , and they . <p> ( For simplicity 's sake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen , " " the toaster , " " Charles and I , " and " the cars , " etc. function the same way as " he , " " she , " " it , " " we , " and " they . " ) <p> To help better understand , we take these subjects and arrange them into a grid based on person ( first , second , and third ) and number ( singular or plural ) : <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> first person : <p> I <p> we <p> second person : <p> you <p> you all <p> third person : <p> he , she , it <p> they <p> First person singular refers to the fact that the speaker or writer is referring to himself or herself ( " I " ) . Second person singular involves speaking or writing directly to someone else ( " you " ) , and third person-singular is writing or speaking about another person or thing ( " he , " " she , " or " it " ) . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up with a plural subject : " I " becomes " we " ; " you " becomes " you all " ( or " y'all " or " you guys " ) ; and " he , " " she , " or " it " becomes " they . " <p> Make sure you understand this grid . It 's very important ; you 'll be seeing a lot of it as you study Spanish . <p> Now let 's examine some conjugations . Look at the grid for the English ( present tense ) conjugations of " to have " : <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> 1st person : <p> have <p> have <p> 2nd person : <p> have <p> have <p> 3rd person : <p> has <p> have <p> Notice that there 's really only one difference in all the conjugations and that it occurs in the third person singular . <p> Ihave a ladder . <p> Johnhas a ladder . <p> Spanish on the other hand is more complicated . Let 's look at the present tense Spanish conjugations of " hablar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plural : <p> 1st person : <p> hablo <p> hablamos <p> 2nd person : <p> hablas <p> hablis <p> 3rd person : <p> habla <p> hablan <p> You should notice that , unlike English , there is a different conjugation for each subject . <p> Spanish : <p> Yohablo Espaol . <p> Thablas Espaol . <p> English : <p> Ispeak Spanish . <p> Youspeak Spanish . <p> As a consequence we may omit the subject since it can not be confused with anything else : <p> Spanish : <p> Hablamos Espaol . <p> English : <p> ( We ) speak Spanish . <p> The same can not be said of English where we need to explicitly identify the subject : <p> Speak Spanish . ? ( ? ) speak Spanish . <p> At this point we should take a closer look at the possible subjects in Spanish . The English subjects look like this : <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> 1st person : <p> I <p> we <p> 2nd person : <p> you <p> you all <p> 3rd person : <p> he , she , it <p> they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular : <p> plural : <p> 1st person : <p> yo <p> nosotros <p> 2nd person : <p> t <p> vosotros <p> 3rd person : <p> Tl , ella <p> ellos , ellas <p> Note : We do not explicitly use " it " as a subject in Spanish : " Es bonito . " ? " It is beautiful . " <p> However , you may already know that when using Spanish we actually have two different possibilities for the 2nd person . One is formal ( Usted/ustedes ) and the other informal ( t , vosotros ) . Therefore our Spanish subject chart should more accurately look like this : <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> 1st person : <p> yo <p> nosotros <p> 2nd person ( informal ) : <p> t <p> vosotros <p> 2nd person ( formal ) : <p> Usted <p> Ustedes <p> 3rd person : <p> Tl , ella <p> ellos , ellas <p> When filling in the same chart with verb conjugations ( once again for " hablar " ) you should notice something : <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( informal ) : <p> hablas <p> hablis <p> 2nd person ( formal ) : <p> habla <p> hablan <p> 3rd person : <p> habla <p> hablan <p> The conjugations for the second person plural formal , are exactly the same as the conjugations for the 3rd person . To simplify things then , even though they are actually second person forms , " Usted " and " Ustedes " are added to the 3rd person box in the conjugation grid : <p> singular : <p> plural : <p> 1st person : <p> yo <p> nosotros <p> 2nd person : <p> t <p> vosotros <p> 3rd person : <p> Tl , ella , Ud . <p> ellos , ellas , Uds . <p> Note : The second person plural , informal " vosotros " form is mainly used in Spain . " Ustedes " is used regardless of the level of formality throughout Latin America .

I gave them to him . <h> The Impersonal Se <p> Occasionally our subjects do n't refer to any one person in particular , but rather a general , nonspecific , unknown person or people . This is known as an " impersonal " subject . In English we we often use the words " you , " " one , " or even " they " to convey this idea . In Spanish to communicate this , we use se : <h> The " No-Fault " Se <p> Sometimes in order to avoid blame or to really emphasize the accidental nature of something , we 'll say things like " My book got lost . " Spanish has a really great way to deny responsibility using the word se : <p> Se me perdieron los libros.Se me olvid= . <p> The first sentence literally translates to something like " The books lost themselves on me , " giving the idea that , " Yes , I lost my books , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost .

@@100547717 @4747717/ <h> Perfect Tenses <p> Now that you know how to form past participles , you 're ready to learn six more verb conjugations known as " perfect " tenses . <p> The word " perfect " here does n't mean that the conjugation is any better than other conjugations , just that the action in question has ( or had ) already been completed . In English we combine a past participle with a form of " to have . " <p> I have run . They have played . She had already left . <p> To create a perfect tense in Spanish we use a past participle together with forms of the verb haber . <h> Haber <p> Now haber is an interesting verb . When used by itself it can only be conjugated in the third person singular because of the way it is translated : <p> conjugation : <p> translation : <p> present tense : <p> hay <p> there is / there are <p> imperfect tense : <p> habfa <p> there was / there were <p> preterite tense : <p> hubo <p> there was / there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be <p> conditional : <p> habrfa <p> there would be <p> You do n't use a subject with haber because the subject is " built-in " so to speak . <p> When we use haber together with a past participle it functions as an auxiliary verb just like " have " does in the English examples above . We have a full range of haber conjugations ( not just third person singular ) for perfect tenses . The kind of perfect tense you have depends on the way you conjugate and translate haber . <h> The Present Perfect Tense <p> As the name implies , the present perfect is a type of present tense conjugation involving a past participle . In English it looks something like this : <p> John has visited his grandparents numerous times . <p> Important Note : Unlike when we used past participles as adjectives above , when we use them in perfect tenses they always end in " -o . " It 's functioning as part of a verb in this case and does n't need to agree in gender or number with anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> How do we translate this sentence ?

Unlike in English we never put anything in between the auxiliary verb and the past participle in Spanish . <h> The Perfect Infinitive <p> Note : It may be helpful to think of this tense as the " infinitive perfect .
