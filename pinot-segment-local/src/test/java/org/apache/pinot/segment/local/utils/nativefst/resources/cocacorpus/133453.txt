The role of the auditor and to whom he owes his duties to is nebulous . The traditional view that has been held was that the auditor owed his primary and legal duty to shareholders in a corporation , yet over the past decade the public 's perception of the auditor is that he owes his duties to other constituent ' users outside the auditor-client nexus . The dissertation commences with an analysis of the U.K. case law with regards to the legal duty of care owed by auditors ' . The role of the auditor is then viewed in relation to shareholders , potential investors and other third parties ( creditors ) . Finally , the role of the auditor as an insurer ' will be examined . In the final analysis it is submitted that a wider duty of care should be created in the area of tort law . Coupled with this are proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying the auditing profession at the moment because of the escalating claims made against them .

This time was characterized by privatisation and liberalisation . Its rise , however , ended abruptly in 2008 with its economic and banking crisis . This crisis was enabled by an inefficient and deregulated banking sector combined with a weak and powerless supervision , which allowed banks to operate well beyond the capacity of the central bank . Total assets of the banking sector equated to 900 percent of the coutry 's GDP . With the beginning of the global financial crisis this model was no longer sustainable . Iceland responded with a mix of partly unorthodox measures : n+ Banking reforms were initiated and supervision was strengthened . n+ Commercials and Central Bank was recapitalized n+ Capital controls were introduced to stop the Icelandic Krona from depreciating n+ Monetary policy was tightened to reduce and stabilise inflation n+ Public expenditure was reduced and taxes raised to return to a budgetary surplus and a positive current account n+ Fiscal deficits were bypassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until now these measures had mixed results . It was possible to reduce inflation rate and stabilise the krona . Also did the fiscal balance return to positive , but is significantly lower than expected and planned . Similarly , the current account returned to appositive level , but nevertheless remained very volatile and small . Further did unemployment rate rise as a consequence of the restrictive policies , but has a trend to lower levels . The measures therefore were partly effective , but their long-term consequences have to be observed further on .

This study aimed to apply a variant of the SDT hypotheses to organisations in Ireland , one private and one public , in order to understand attitudes to motivation and help direct future action to improve employee performance and engagement . The results from a mixed-quantitative design showed that Autonomous Motivation predicted higher Job Satisfaction and Organisation Commitment in both companies , and greater Well-being in the Private Company . Additionally , Perceived Autonomy Support was positively related to Autonomous Motivation , Organisation Commitment and Job Satisfaction . Differences highlighted included higher levels of Affective and Continuance Commitment in the Public Company ; lower Continuance Commitment among younger employees , and higher Extrinsic Motivation among males . In conclusion , the study broadly supported the hypotheses and the principles set out in SDT .

It is estimated that the industry is valued at roughly four billion US dollars worldwide ( Blossfeld &amp; Schmitz , 2011 ) . There is very little research into this new dating landscape , particularly in Ireland . This study examined the experiences and attitudes of a random sample of the population aged between 18 and 39 . A total of 191 participants were split into two groups based on age .

The systems model generates the following types of communication : direct , or contiguous communication , and indirect communication , involving displaced reference , exemplified by indexical , iconic , and symbolic communication . Indexes are physical changes created by a communicator in the environment ( e.g. a shadow , a footprint , or a photograph ) . Iconic communication in turn is based on perceived similarity between sign and referent - a cognitive disposition reflected in art as well as in human tendency to interpret the world in terms of analogies and correspondences . Finally symbols , with their arbitrary connection between sign and referent , underlie the unique communicative phenomenon of human syntactic speech . The distinguished types of communication appear to correspond with the evolutionary sequence of interactions between inanimate .

This will entail a peering into the mind of those who kill repetitively , an understanding of their fears and the methods they employ in an attempt to deal with them . The first section is mainly an elaboration of Mark Seltzer 's book " Serial Killers : Death and Life in America 's Wound Culture , " which sees serial killing as a method employed by certain psychotic individuals to counteract the experience of a dissolution of self . With this phenomenon we will see a dissolving of the boundaries between private and public , fantasy and reality , mind and body , person and place , and human and machine . The next section is a reading of Freud 's 1920 paper , " Beyond the Pleasure Principle . " This text clarifies even further the addictive nature of the murders in serial killing . The subsequent section discusses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incorporating such notions as the formation of the ego , infantile fantasies ( the imagoes of the fragmented body , ) the necessity of sexual difference and the realms of the Real and the Symbolic . The last section consists of a case study of Theodore Robert Bundy , a man who killed at least twenty-eight women ( but probably many more ) in extraordinarily brutal ways . This was a man of above average intelligence , who was charming , likeable and even worked on a crisis helpline . For a man with so much on offer to him with a choice of a normal life , to decide to risk his freedom and destroy his sense of decency in becoming a serial killer must have required a powerful impetus of some sort . I will show how Bundy 's life , and words support the theory put forward in this Final Year Project that serial killing is an addiction , underlying which is the desire to return to the infantile state of being at one with the mother .

Data was gathered using ten semi-structured in-depth interviews . Thematic qualitative analysis was implemented to analyse participant perspectives on the adequacy of current Irish state services regarding child sexual abuse . Generated data from ten participants comprised of both genders with an estimated mean age of thirty-eight and from diverse socio-economic backgrounds in Ireland . This report found strong prevailing themes emerging from the gathered literature and analysis . Participants provided additional information to the analysis when reflecting on past and present experiences working with victims of child sexual abuse in Ireland . While it is perceived that Ireland is failing to protect children from abuse in the current society , it is in truth the inadequacy and lack of funding by the state that further inhibits inadequately trained personnel in the area of child protection . This furthermore reflects on the inefficient services available for child victims of sexual abuse .

The purpose of this research is to understand the Experiential Marketing 's concept and benefits as well as determining its impact on consumer buyer behaviour and brand management , to finally settle on its effectiveness in FMCG markets while opposed to Traditional marketing . Firstly , a literature review has been done to explain the main theory and concepts linked to Experiential Marketing .

The findings show that Experiential Marketing is useful to communicate in FMCG markets and to differentiate a brand from another because of its in-depth action , memorisation and creation of an emotional link between the brand and the consumer which last longer . It had been demonstrated that Experiential Marketing leads more easily to purchase than advertising however it is necessary to consider it as an efficient additional communication tool and not a replacement to advertising .

As the child develops through adolescence and adulthood , these models are the guide for expectations , perceptions and behaviour in all close relationships . As the individual follows their learned pattern of behaviour , they evoke reciprocal or complementary responses , as a result , an individual 's close relationships tend to follow a pattern and the individual is said to have an attachment style . Studies show that there are three major styles of attachment , secure , avoidant and anxious / ambivalent ( Ainsworth , 1989 ) . While attachment styles are relatively stable , significant events or relationships can influence a change in attachment style . Attachment theory proposes that such change is the goal in psychotherapy . This goal can be accomplished if a strong therapeutic alliance is created between the psychotherapist and the client . In this relationship , the client experiences a close relationship that does not follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern by responding to the client 's attachment style and behaviour . The client experiences the psychotherapist as consistency , reliability and responsive " the psychotherapist becomes a secure base for the client . In order to provide this experience for a client , attachment theorists propose that it is beneficial for the psychotherapist to be securely attached . However , while several studies have examined the influence of the client 's attachment style on the outcome of the treatment , very few studies have focused on the attachment style of the psychotherapist . The objective of this research was to investigate if psychotherapists are more securely attached than the general population . 113 participants took part in this study , 36 were psychotherapists and 77 were members of the general population . Participants completed the Adult Attachment Scale ( Collins &amp; Read , 1990 ) which measured the attachment style in terms of three types , namely Secure , Avoidant and Anxious . Results show the psychotherapists were significantly more likely to have a predominantly secure attachment style than general population .

The meaning of the Slovene 's impotence is beyond Freud , unlike the frrst case where Freud spies the cause as excessive obedience , remorse , guilt or indeed any number of abundant explanations that all point to the prohibition of the super-ego . The paradox of the Slovene is that he appears to have no good reason to 1 be impotent for he is completely immoral and without conscience , thus free from the ethics that prohibit enjoyment , yet this Slovene is completely incapable of sexual enjoyment , the first patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freud was clearly unable to fathom the cause or truth of this Slovene 's impotence , and the aggressivity of his response suggests his active resistance to this instance of a prohibition beyond his conception of morality and the super-ego . This short discussion of this letter by Zizek , is what led me to take up this thesis . This scenario communicated a number of questions to me that I was eager to answer . If the Slovene is without morals , and thus without a super-ego , why is it that he is even more prohibited from enjoyment than the cultured Italian ? How can there be a prohibition against enjoyment beyond the super-ego , or in other words how can there be a prohibition in the absence of the law of the super-ego ? Why was it that Freud was resistant to the questions posed by this un-analysable Slovene ? What was it that stopped this Slovene from enjoying ? These questions led me to explore not only the status of the super-ego but also the concept of enjoyment and the relation between them . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a new concept I have defmed as the Real Super-ego . 1 This quotation from Freud 's letter to Edoardo Weiss , as reproduced from S. Zizek'sFor they know not what they do : Enjoyment as a Political Factor , which in turn gives reference to the letter as , Sigmund Freud/Edoardo Weiss , Lettres sur la pratique psychanalytique , Toulouse Privat 1975 , p.55 . Unless otherwise stated I draw no distinction between the Ethical and the Moral . For example I mean exactly the same thing by Moral Action as I do by Ethical Action . Where I use a capital M or E , I am directly referring to the Ethical or Moral as defined by Kant and to which Lacan attends . On the rare occasion that I am referring to other moral theories or to something moral or ethical that is not so by Kantian theory I shall state my intention and also use a small m or e , i.e. moral or ethical . The only exception to this rule of style will be quotations where I shall retain the style chosen by the particular author .

The aim ofthis experiment was to examine whether physically attractive stimulus individuals as opposed to unattractive stimulus persons regardless of gender are deemed to be good in a wide variety of ways . According to Dion , Berscheid &amp; Walster ( 1972 ) the " what is beautiful is good " hypoFinal Year Project is still pervasive in employment today . This theory notes that individuals who more physically attractive are seen to possess goodness in character , sociability , love , life and are more favoured in attaining a job . Thus this study examined if physical attractiveness were a determinant in attaining employment primarily for a neutral job and secondly for a masculine typed job . This present study used 108 recruitment consultants to rate the subject 's hireability . In the first condition 60 consultants aged between 18-26 were asked to rate the hireability of either a physically attractive female and physically unattractive female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male applicant . Each of the two sets of applicants were applying for a bank clerk position , which was a neutral type of job . Thirty of the consultants were female and the other half were male .

Attached to the other CV was the unattractive applicants CV and picture and response sheet , each applicant had to fill out both of the response sheet . In the second condition 48 consultants took part in rating the hireability of the applicants who were applying for a male gender typed job . The position that was vacant was that of a managerial executive position . In this condition each of the consultants received a brown envelope , which contained two CV 's attached to one CV , was a picture of an attractive female applicant , attached to the second was a picture of an unattractive female applicant . Each consultant was asked to answer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each applicant . It was proposed that in the first condition due to the " what is beautiful is good " hypoFinal Year Project that there would be a significant difference between the hireability ratings given to the attractive and unattractive applicants , a significant difference occurred . Thus the " what is beautiful is good hypoFinal Year Project was supported . In the second condition it was hypoFinal Year Projected that there would be a significant difference between the hireability ratings given to the attractive and unattractive female applicant . However no significant difference was found , therefore the " beauty is beastly " hypoFinal Year Project was not supported .

Correlational analyses were used to explore relationships between attachment styles , desire for and feelings about having children . There was a significant relationship between ambivalence and perceived inability to relate to children . ( Pearson r=.258 , p&lt;0.05 , 2-tail ) suggesting more ambivalence is related to perceived inability to relate to children . No significant effects were found for avoidance . The results of this study lend partial support to how attachment styles are related to pre-parenthood attitudes about having children and the capacity to be a good parent . Attachment theory provides a useful framework with which to evaluate perceptions of parenting and the parental role and this could further understanding of the intergenerational transmission of insecure attachment . In conclusion , implications of the present findings are discussed and it is asserted that further research is necessary to come to a more robust conclusion .

One hundred part-time students , male and female , from the 2nd and 4th year classes , completed self-report measures of test anxiety , self-efficacy , life orientation , personality traits and trait-state anxiety . results revealed no significant difference in levels of test anxiety between genders and between 2nd and 4th year students . A negative significant relationship was found between test anxiety and both self-efficacy and optimism , and a significant positive relationshsip was found between test anxiety and trait anxiety and neuroticism . Further results did n't support the research 's premises as test anxiety levels were not found to be significantly related to conscientiousness . Lastly , a multiple regression analysis found optimism and trait anxiety to be significant predictors of test anxiety . Avenues of further research and implications for the development of interventions to help students cope with test anxiety are discussed .

A correlational design was used to deliver a cross-sectional survey with measures of self-efficacy , encouragement , neighbourhood influence , age , and gender to 181 emerging adults . The model predicted 25% of the variance in physical activity with self-efficacy ( B =.379 ) and encouragement ( B = .244 ) being the strongest predictors . Whereas men and women had different patterns of self-efficacy and physical activity , gender did not predict physical activity .

In so doing a number of other variables were examined for significant relationships with the stress experienced by teachers of an inclusive classroom , including the teachers ' perceived self-efficacy , life orientation , education level taught and the number of special needs students in the classroom . A survey method was used on a convenience sample from 5 schools , 150 questionnaires were distributed but only 73 responses were received . Results indicated no significant difference in the stress levels between the two groups however a significant relationship was found between teacher stress and perceived self-efficacy ( r(49)=-.401 , p=.004 ) . Implications for teaching resources and further professional development issues are discussed within . Author keywords : stress , teachers , self-efficacy , life orientation , inclusive education

To do so projects and changes are part of the daily challenges of businesses . Lack of communication and resistance to change were identified to influence the success of projects . This dissertation aims to identify communication practices during change projects and their value with regard to the success of these projects in Dublin-based tour operators . Web-based questionnaires were sent out to tour operators to examine communication techniques and effectiveness , employees perception of lack of communication and employee involvement in change projects . The findings of the empirical study were analysed and discussed with regard to the hypotheses asked and the relevant literature . The study finds that while general communication is perceived as being executed well , change-specific information is not passed on to employees as efficient or accurate and change communication could be improved . Furthermore it was shown that employees would like to be more involved in company projects and changes . Recommendations based on the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication process within the company . The use of change agents , direct communication between employees and their direct manager , and integrating employees early in the collection of information and the decision-making process are among these recommendations . Finally implications for further research include the influence of cultural differences in communication on change processes and change communication . Furthermore researching the topic with the use of focus groups , observational studies or case studies is a recommendation for future research .

The collaborative partnership worked very well for 24 years . In 2013 following a strategic review and with mutual agreement with LJMU , DBS decided to move to seek accreditation of all of it 's academic awards by Quality and Qualifications Ireland ( QQI ) . <p> Whilst the partnership between LJMU and DBS is now in the teach-out phase , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely to support students currently undertaking LJMU awards to the completion of their programme . <h> Quality &amp; Qualifications Ireland ( QQI ) ( Formerly HETAC ) <p> In 1992 DBS became a designated institution with the Higher Education and Training Awards Council HETAC ) .

Employees are required to readily adapt to change , however accounts of resistance to change are more prevalent than accounts of employees embracing change . To implement change organisations rely on employee motivational and behaviour needs , the Self Determination Theory as it pertains to need satisfaction was used in the study . Organisational change can result in employees experiencing stress , uncertainty and fear about coping with the situation . This study examined the relationship between need satisfaction , stress , coping and resistance to change . 90 participants completed an online questionnaire . Results from a mixed-method survey design showed that need satisfaction did not predict resistance to change . Relationships were found between need satisfaction , coping and stress , and between coping and stress and resistance to change levels . In conclusion , results are useful in explaining the interactions between coping , stress and resistance to change . Author keywords : Basic need satisfaction , resistance to change , coping

Coming back home brought with it many challenges but I found this gradual transition back to full time education both profoundly exciting and highly rewarding . One of which was warmly supported by the student services at DBS , making the once feared concept of returning to college whist juggling a part time job and having personal commitments a lot easier to grasp and take on . <p> Throughout my three years studying the BA ( Hons ) in Psychology , the student focus and support from every lecture across each module was fantastic and extremely reliable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuition , challenges set in place and opportunities to grow as a student , constant . <p> Not only does undertaking this journey broaden ones knowledge and understanding of the diversities across human behaviour , it offers students the opportunity to engage with one of the most exciting and rapidly growing areas in research ; bringing to the fore highly interactive class discussions , supported by the on-going expertise from the lectures across every module . <p> Covering a myriad of core areas in Psychology in alignment with QQI requirements , DBS offers a unique aspect unlike most colleges in Ireland , in that it provides students with significant volume of Psychoanalysis throughout the degree . Having no previous knowledge of this aspect to Psychology , I was immediately gripped by the clinical relevance Psychoanalysis has to offer when treating various dispositions . <p> Becoming a member of the Psychological Society of Ireland , attending workshops and guest speaker events that were held throughout Dublin City across different Universities , provided me with practical insight into the areas I could further my career as a student of Psychology outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a member of the Student Psychology Society in DBS . Since completing my undergraduate at DBS , I have been offered a three-year scholarship with the University of Dublin , Trinity College to undergo my PhD studies on the hidden prevalence of New Psychoactive Substance use and what psychological factors one considers prior to their decision to use drugs . <p> This opportunity is a prime example of how effective reaching out to research lectures at DBS can be , which I did in my second year and as a result was fortunate enough to gain voluntary research assistant experience in Trinity College throughout my time studying in DBS . This is but one of the many accolades I have to thank the lectures at DBS for . <p> Achieving an honours degree from DBS in Psychology not only brings you opportunities across a diversity of academic avenues to further explore upon , it instils a great deal of self-belief and understanding of ones own well-being , which you can carry with you into the next chapter of wherever your journey may take you .

Speculators start to believe that a price rise signals a further future rise and consequently they purchase more shares , and for a while speculation becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy ( Pilbeam , 2010 , p. 252 ) . <p> 4 .

We decided to focus on this subject because it concerned one of the most famous brands of the world but also because it seemed to be interesting to understand if Guinness 's reputation and image were enough strong to not have been affected by a strategic changes as rebranding . Therefore our research question was : How Guinness rebranding has led to establish/reinforce its reputation ?

The specific events this paper examines concern the influence the ECB exerted on the Italian Political Scenario between August and November 2011 on two specific occasions , events which culminated in the forced resignation of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi . The conflict our research attempts to elucidate pertains to the inconsistency between the ECB 's concept of political independence ( here intended as the influence used on the EU Member states ) with the influence the ECB exerted on the Italian Political scene in 2011 . In other words : Is the ECB really politically independent from and to the EU Member States ? Can its intervention in the Italian Political scene in 2011 be justified in terms of financial stability ? Can we say with Machiavelli , that the ends justify the means and that the final result is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal ?

@@22241237 @2241237/ <h> Abstract : <p> Research suggests that the desire for fame appears to be increasing among preteens and teenagers ( Uhls &amp; Greenfield , 2012 ) and , as the findings of a survey conducted in Ireland suggests , many would drop out of school if they had an opportunity to fulfil their dreams of fame ( Regan , 2006 ) . Some commentators attribute this growing desire for fame to the rise of reality TV formats , which appear to have become a platform for ordinary ' people to become famous regardless of talent ( Turner , 2010 ) . Given the growing fascination with celebrities over the recent years , and based on Bandura 's ( 2001 ) social cognitive theory of mass communication , the aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between celebrity worship and the desire to participate on reality TV shows . A correlational , cross-sectional design was utilised . A random sample of one hundred and eighteen participants were administered the Celebrity Attitude Scale ( CAS ) , the Aspiration Index Revised ( AI-R ) and three short scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Facebook usage . The results indicated a significant moderate positive correlation between celebrity worship and the desire to participate on reality TV ( r = 366 , p = .001 ) as well as a significant moderate correlation between the desire for fame and the willingness to put a career on hold if the opportunity to take part on reality TV was offered ( r = 399 , p = .001 ) . The conclusions drawn from the results suggest that celebrity worship has an influence on people 's desire for fame and future aspirations and that people would be willing to sacrifice their career in order to pursue it . Future research could focus on a qualitative approach to further explore the reality TV participation and desire for fame . Author keywords : Celebrity worship , reality TV , desire for fame

Literature review " A wide range of literature was analysed to attain knowledge about pre-existing theories with reference to accounting changes and their impacts on ( 1 ) analysts ' forecast revision behaviour , and ( 2 ) forecast accuracy during pre-adoption periods . Moreover , by reviewing impairment methods , IAS 39 's incurred loss model and the expected loss model prescribed by IFRS 9 , a basis for understanding the implications of this impairment-method change on banks ' financial statements is provided . Finally , the literature chapter discusses studies previously conducted which quantify the expected transitional impacts caused by the impairment method change on banks ' loss allowance . Design / methodology / approach " To address the complexity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study approach was adopted as the research method , aimed to holistically test whether certain theories apply to changes in the particularly-complex accounting standard IAS 39 for real-life situations for the five largest banks in Europe . Aside from previous studies , this thesis assesses forecast accuracy between the researchers ' own estimates and published analyst forecasts . Findings " The empirical results indicate that the impairment change currently plays a more subordinated role in analyst forecasts for these five banks than other factors . In addition , results hint that analyst forecasts for these five banks are likely to be significantly revised in the near future . Research limitations " Caused by the forward-looking nature of this research , findings within this study are biased by subjective judgements made by the researcher , as well as by the availability of public data at the time this research was conducted . Furthermore , due to the characteristics of a case study approach , the samples selected within the research are not to represent the population as a whole , thus insights are limited to these particular cases . Originality/value - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the new impairment rules in analyst forecasts , falling stock prices will more than likely materialise for banks in the near future due to IFRS 9 .

The term entrepreneurial orientation is used to refer to an individual predisposed to entrepreneurial behaviour and therefore more likely to initiate a business venture than individuals lacking these traits . These three personality variables were measured using three self-report questionnaires . The Manifest Needs Questionnaire ( Steers and Braunstein , 1976 ) , The Proactive Personality Scale ( Bateman and Crant , 1993 ) and the Internal-External Locus of Control Scale ( Rotter , 1966 ) . This study aims to investigate whether entrepreneurial orientation is higher among an immigrant group and an Irish group . The participants are fifty- four immigrants and fifty- six native Irish people . The participants received either an English , or Russian , version of the questionnaire to be completed there and then , collected afterwards , or posted back . The results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant difference between the groups on each of the tests . A significant difference was found . ( f(2,108) = 23.14 , p&lt;0.01 ) The results support the notion that immigrants have a significantly higher entrepreneurial orientation than Irish . Closing suggestions include a change to the current immigration law to encourage immigrants ' innate entrepreneurial orientation and a call for more culture specific research into entrepreneurial behaviour .

The ability to advertise goods and services in a time , location , and personalised manner has made mobile advertising the centre of attention in the business world . However , as consumers spend more and more time on their mobile devices , marketers have struggled to exploit this channel effectively to communicate with their target customers . Although studies have been conducted in this area , there is still some uncertainty with regards to what consumers ' attitudes are towards mobile advertising . This is particularly the case in Ireland , where little research has been done in this area to date .
