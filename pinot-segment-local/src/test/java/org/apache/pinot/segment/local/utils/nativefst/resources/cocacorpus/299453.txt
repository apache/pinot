@@24824666 @4824666/ <h> Menu <h> A push to get lenders to reward energy efficiency in homes <h> Efforts are underway in the appraisal , lending , building and realty brokerage industries " even in Congress " to recognize and value home energy efficiency . <p> By Kenneth R. Harney <p> November 24 , 2013 <p> LA Times- <p> WASHINGTON " For the growing numbers of home purchasers who care about energy efficiency , its the ultimate " green " goal : Lenders should recognize the net savings that energy improvements provide to property owners and take them into account when they underwrite and set the fees for mortgages . Appraisers should also recognize the added value . <p> The rationale : Owners of homes that reduce energy consumption pay lower utility bills than owners of energy guzzlers , so why not factor these out-of-pocket savings into calculations of household debt-to-income ratios and appraised valuations ? This might permit larger mortgage amounts for energy-efficient homes and help qualify more first-time buyers who are now frequently rejected on debt-ratio grounds . <p> Though this is commonplace in other countries , its a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pending in the Senate " the Sensible Accounting to Value Energy ( SAVE ) Act " that would require- Fannie Mae , - Freddie Mac , the- Federal Housing Administration- and other federal mortgage players to revise their rules to better recognize and reward energy savings . <p> More than 125 local Realtor multiple-listing services across the country are helping out by including " green fields " in their online listing information displays . The green fields allow sellers , buyers , realty agents and appraisers to describe energy improvements or special certifications that a property offers , such as high-performance windows and doors , heavy-duty insulation , Energy Star appliances , and solar , geothermal and other features . <p> Thousands of appraisers are undergoing " green valuation " training and the countrys largest association in that field , the Appraisal Institute , has created a comprehensive " green addendum " that can be used to translate energy conservation improvements into higher property valuations . <p> But there 's just been another milestone on the way to seeing green in real estate : A major American private mortgage insurance company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to offer a version of what it already provides to buyers in Canada " cost savings to energy conservers . <p> Adam Johnston , chief appraiser for Genworth Mortgage Insurance , says his company is determined to incorporate energy savings and green valuations into its underwriting procedures . This is becoming more feasible , he said , because of advances such as the green appraisal addendum , more accurate multiple-listing service listing data and growing acceptance of energy-efficiency standards for homes . <p> In Canada , Genworth offers buyers a 10% " energy-efficient refund " of their mortgage insurance premiums , a break on debt-to-income ratio calculations in underwriting and online access to discounts on a wide variety of commonly purchased household items . <p> here 's an example of how the program works north of the border . On a $300,000 mortgage with a 5% down payment , the total insurance premium comes to $8,250 .

John Campbell , ( R. , Calif. ) , and Rep. Gary Peters , ( D. , Mich . ) . The bill seeks to replace troubled government-seized housing giants- Fannie Mae- ( FNMA : 0.38 , -0.01 , -2.05% ) and- Freddie Mac- ( FMCC : 0.40 , +0.00 , +0.88% ) , which would be wound down based on a plan set up by their regulator . <p> Jaret Seiberg , analyst at- MF Global- Inc. in Washington , said the bill is the kind of legislation that he believes could eventually emerge from Congress . " It preserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30-year , fixed-rate- mortgages- will continue to be readily available , " he commented . <p> However , Seiberg said it was introduced too early in the political fight and it will be hard for many Republicans to support this approach . <p> While the legislation does not yet have the support of leadership in either party , it is unusual in that it has the backing of both a Republican and Democrat . <p> Top Republicans have advanced bills that would lead to a mostly private- mortgage- market , while Democrats have pushed for a government role in the mortgage industry . <p> The two legislators anticipate there being 15 to 20 or more firms chartered to securitize residential mortgages operating in the marketplace , according to Christopher Bognanno , a spokesman for Campbell . <p> He said the bill does not specify whether the companies should hold a portfolio of mortgages the way Fannie and Freddie currently have on their books .

The fund would be capitalized by assessing a special guarantee fee to buyers of the packaged mortgage securities .

Above , Fannie Maes headquarters in Washington . ( Manuel Balce Ceneta / Associated Press ) <p> By Kenneth R. HarneyNovember 3 , 2013 , - LA Times <p> WASHINGTON " Should you be concerned that the maximum loan amount you 'll be able to obtain through the biggest players in the mortgage industry " - Fannie Mae- andFreddie Mac- " might be cut sometime next spring ? Maybe you should . <p> That 's because mortgage applicants who no longer qualify under the revised limits will be forced to shop in the so-called jumbo arena , where minimum credit scores and financial reserve requirements tend to be tougher and down payments heftier than in the conventional space dominated by Fannie and Freddie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgage rather than a fixed-rate one . Or you might end up in a situation where you need a higher-rate " piggyback " second mortgage to afford the down payment on the first mortgage deal you 're offered . <p> here 's a quick overview of what could push eligible loan amounts downward and what that may mean for thousands of buyers across the country who abruptly find themselves in jumbo land . <p> At a meeting in Washington recently , Edward J. DeMarco , acting director of the agency that oversees Fannie and Freddie in conservatorship , said he was seriously considering reducing loan maximums as part of a strategy to lessen federal involvement in the mortgage market . Though he offered no specifics on dollar amounts , industry analysts say the maximum Fannie-Freddie loan size could drop from the current $417,000 to $400,000 in most parts of the country , and from $625,500 to $600,000 in designated high-cost areas such as coastal California , metropolitan Washington , D.C. , New York City and its suburbs , parts of New Jersey , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Colorado , Idaho , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect as early as May . <p> Those decreases may not sound like much , but theyll affect large numbers of consumers who want to purchase homes with prices above the average for their areas , especially newly built houses . Real estate and lending groups are concerned that making mortgage money tougher to obtain " pushing buyers into a segment of the market where Fannie and Freddie can not operate " is counterproductive in a housing economy still struggling to recover from bust and recession . <p> There 's another , perhaps more important , problem here as well : Reducing loan amounts next spring would complicate what is already shaping up as a challenging lending environment for consumers in 2014 , critics say . <p> Starting in January , new federal regulations that restrict debt-to-income ratios and allowable total fees in " qualified " mortgages will take effect and make significant numbers of applications ineligible for Fannie-Freddie loan terms . Some industry estimates suggest that as many as 1 in 5 borrowers this year would not pass the qualified mortgage tests scheduled for next year . <p> Though DeMarco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freddie , congressional critics contend that he lacks the statutory authority to do so . A bipartisan group of 66 House members sent a letter to DeMarco arguing that he is prohibited by " specific language " in an economic stimulus law passed in 2008 from lowering the limits set by- Congress . DeMarcos legal team disputes that interpretation . <p> The fight over Fannie-Freddie loan limits focuses fresh attention on what could become a much more significant piece of the market : jumbos . Because they are larger than conventional mortgages " ranging from just above $417,000 to seven figures " jumbos traditionally have come with extra costs and underwriting restrictions . Though jumbo interest rates now average slightly above conventional rates , they often require stellar FICO credit scores in the upper 700s , down payments of 20% or more and lots of spare money in the bank . Fannie and Freddie loans , by contrast , are less restrictive and allow down payments of 5% to 10% with mortgage insurance . <p> Some lenders are beginning to relax their jumbo terms , however , and are offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultant with Wintrust Mortgage in St. Louis , for example , said his firm can do jumbos with down payments as low as 10% but at a slightly higher interest rate than jumbos with 20% to 30% down . <p> Bottom line : If you 're thinking about buying a house with an above-average price for your area next year , think jumbo mortgages .

Harney , LA Times <p> February 13 , 2011 <p> Reporting from Washington <p> Thousands of homeowner associations and condominiums around the country just sidestepped a potentially costly problem : A federal agency this month backed off its controversial plan that would have made obtaining mortgages in their communities much more difficult , and would have dried up a key source of revenue that associations use to pay for improvements and property maintenance . <p> A proposal in August by the Federal Housing Finance Agency would have in effect banned the covenanted transfer fees that many homeowner associations collect when houses or condos are resold . The fees typically range from 0.25% to 0.75% of the resale price of the house . The revenue is then spent on such things as community improvements " upgrading roads , bike paths , recreation facilities " and building up required capital reserves . <p> The agency proposed banning the fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises it oversees " Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks . The same proposal also banned loans containing private transfer fees where the money flows not to community improvements but to investors seeking long-term revenue streams . <p> " This was a really big deal " to persuade the Federal Housing Finance Agency to reverse its position , said Cort Chalfant , senior vice president of Rancho Sahuarita , a master-planned community with 12,000 residents near Tucson . <p> Chalfant said the 0.75% transfer fee collected on resales in Rancho Sahuarita is spent on upgrading amenities and facilities . Without the fees , the association would have to raise its annual homeowner assessments dramatically " putting financial pressure on homeowners " at a lousy time economically to do that , " he added . <p> Chalfant estimates that if it had been adopted , the federal agencys proposed rule would have cost the association $10 million over the coming decade , and would have decimated sales and property values since none of the houses would be eligible for conventional mortgages . <p> Peter Kristian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Hilton Head , S.C. , said the effect on his community of 4,100 homes would have been equally devastating . Kristians association raises roughly $250,000 to $300,000 a year for public-benefit improvements through 0.25% transfer fees on resales . <p> When the housing finance agency proposed its initial rule , it was critical of covenanted homeowner association transfer fees for being " unrelated to the value rendered , " and at times applying " even if the propertys value has significantly declined since the time the covenant was imposed . " <p> The proposal was also highly critical of investor-driven private transfer fee programs , such as one marketed by Freehold Capital Partners , a New York company that imposes 1% transfer fees on home resales for 99 years . The company says it has signed up thousands of development projects worth " hundreds of billions of dollars " around the country .

The institute polled its members and found that an estimated half of them " representing about 11 million houses , condos and cooperative units " rely on deed-based transfer fees . Owners of those homes would be cut off from most mortgage financing under the housing finance agencys proposal , worsening the housing crisis that sent Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into severe financial distress . <p> The agencys revised proposal essentially says : Oops , sorry . We were a little too broad-brush the first time around . Now we get it , and well exempt homeowner associations that use the proceeds of transfer fees to benefit the property or community .

But they 've been notoriously difficult to complete , with buyers and sellers often playing a long waiting game before hearing back from lenders . <p> Now , however , a new government program plus some lender initiatives may make for shorter wait times and a smoother process . " Any structure is better than what we 've had , " says Kathryn Bovard , a broker/manager for Prudential Americana Group in the Las Vegas area . <p> Short sales are useful for borrowers who are underwater on their mortgage , owing more on the home than its currently worth . In a short sale , the homeowners lender accepts less than what the borrower owes on the mortgage in order to complete the sale . Both parties thus avoid the foreclosure process . <h> Foreclosure Alternatives <p> The governments Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives ( HAFA ) program goes into effect April 5 . <p> " Its an extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution before it gets to the worst , " says Arvin Wijay , chief executive of Retreat Capital , a provider of products and services that facilitate short-sale management and loan modifications . If the borrower does n't  qualify for a modification , loan servicers will then assess the possibility of a short sale through the HAFA program . <p> Here are some ways HAFA is expected to improve the traditional short-sale process : <p> Borrowers will receive pre-approved short-sale terms before listing the property , including either a list price approved by the servicer or the acceptable sale proceeds , according to the U.S. Treasury Department . That way , sellers know what lenders will accept before listing the property . <p> There 's a set timeline , with deadlines for lenders and sellers to keep the short-sale process moving . <p> At the completion of a sale , borrowers may get up to $1,500 for relocation expenses and servicers may receive compensation of up to $1,000 . Up to $3,000 of proceeds are available to distribute to subordinate lien holders , making it possible to compensate second-mortgage lenders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new program will be a great help to people . <p> " The homeowner should be encouraged that the government is doing something , " but people should not expect it " to change the world overnight , " says Fred Weaver , co-owner of Group 46:10 , a team of agents who focus on short sales as part of Keller Williams Arizona Realty , in Tempe , Ariz . <p> Successful implementation also depends on servicers staff . " Some servicers are good at finding the right people , and have the right technology , " says Mr. Wijay . Some , he says , are not . <p> In the past , it was common for one mortgage-servicer employee to be responsible for managing hundreds of short-sale applications .

Move-in-ready bank-owned properties typically sell for 99% of their listing price . <h> Words of Advice <p> For homeowners considering a short sale , Ms. Bovard says its important they speak to their trusted advisers , including their attorney and tax accountant , as well as a real-estate agent who has a short-sale designation . <p> When looking for a real-estate agent , says Kevin Kauffman , co-owner of Group 46:10 , homeowners should ask about the agents track record with short sales : " How many have you closed ? The follow-up question : How many did you fail on how many went into foreclosure ? " <p> Also , ask questions about the agents strategy in getting the job done , he says . <p> For buyers , a lot of patience is required to finish one of these deals , says Ms. Bovard .

" And we are benefiting from having more high-credit borrowers . " <p> Still , FHA watchers warn that the agency does n't  have much of a cushion against these rising delinquencies and foreclosures .

The policy is widely considered one of the key federal government moves that has encouraged private investors in large numbers " often mom-and-pop , small-scale operations " to buy foreclosed and deteriorating houses from lenders , then repair them and resell within short periods of time.Since the plan was first put into place by the Obama administration in February 2010 , more than 65,000 renovated homes have been financed using more than $11 billion in FHA-backed loans , according to federal officials .

After scandals in Los Angeles , New York , Baltimore , Washington , D.C. , and other large cities over widespread fraudulent flips " in which houses were sometimes resold for double their previous price within days or even hours " the FHA stopped insuring loans on houses whose sellers had owned them for less than 90 days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renovating distressed properties , welcomed the extension of the FHA policy because " it allows predominantly first-time buyers to compete with cash buyers , investors and others " for houses at affordable prices that have been professionally repaired .

This may sound elementary , but some flippers during the late 1990s never bothered to acquire title and record it . They took over the property one day , slapped a little paint on the outside and sold it for cash the following day . <p> If the selling price is 20% higher than what the house cost the seller , a second appraisal , conducted by a member of the FHAs panel of approved appraisers , is mandatory to be certain that the improvements made to the property justify the increased price . <p> An independent inspection report , conducted by a professional with no connection to other participants in the transaction , is also mandatory when the price jump is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could affect the " health and safety " of the purchasers , they must be completed and a re-inspection conducted before the closing . <p> Bottom line : Flipping under the FHAs rules should continue to be an important option for buyers of renovated , previously distressed houses and the investors who make it their business to find them and fix them up .

The regulations also require lenders to verify borrowers financial statements and discourage total debt payments " including credit cards and student loans " that amount to more than 43 percent of a borrowers annual income . <p> During the housing bubble , banks often did n't  require minimum credit scores or check incomes to make sure borrowers would be able to make mortgage payments . <p> Millions of homeowners got into trouble after taking out loans with no or low down payments that many did n't  fully understand as interest rates skyrocketed , unemployment soared and the housing market crashed . <p> The rules unveiled Thursday are a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed by Congress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was charged with creating and enforcing the lending rules . <p> The new criteria represent " the true essence of responsible lending , " said Richard Cordray , the bureaus director . " When consumers sit down at the closing table , they should n't be set up to fail with mortgages they cant afford . " <p> Cordray noted that in years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis , consumers could easily obtain mortgages that they could not afford to repay . <p> But in subsequent years , banks tightened standards so much that many people have had trouble qualifying at all . <p> The new rules seek out a middle ground by protecting consumers from bad loans while giving banks the legal assurances they need to increase lending , he said . <p> The rules do not specify a minimum down payment . <p> A loan that meets the new standards will be considered a " qualified mortgage , " which the bureau says will protect banks from lawsuits that may be filed by borrowers or buyers of mortgage-backed securities . <p> Consumer advocates and bank officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But some in the banking industry say the restrictions could make it harder for lower-income buyers to get mortgages . <p> " We have heard the horror stories and witnessed families and communities torn apart by mortgages they could not afford , " said Natalie E.

As a result , we understand the difficult balance ( the bureau ) is trying to achieve . " <p> Highlights of the rules : <p> Lenders must document a borrowers employment , income , assets and current debts , as well as credit history and mortgage history , and make sure the borrower can repay the loan . The lenders will have to determine the consumers ability to repay both the principal and the interest over the long term , not just during the introductory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Teaser rates " that adjust upward and large balloon payments at the end of the loan period will be limited . <p> A qualified mortgage will have limits on points and fees , including those used to compensate loan originators , such as loan officers and brokers .

A qualified mortgage can not have terms that exceed 30 years , interest-only payments or negative-amortization payments that increase the principal amount . " In the lead-up to the crisis , too many consumers took on risky loans that they did n't  understand . They did n't  realize their debt or payments could increase , or that they werent building any equity in the home , " the bureau said . <p> The rules cap the amount of income that can go toward debt .

" The liability protections offered by the ( bureau ) are an encouraging first step to nudge banks to loosen their purse strings , but we think more can be done , " she said . She advocates pre-purchase or pre-refinance counseling by a third party for all mortgage borrowers . <p> Vincent Howard , a Costa Mesa attorney with mortgage and foreclosure-related cases , suggested that simply making- new rules might not be the answer .

" The ( bureau ) should not create a loophole that allows high-fee loans to count as a qualified mortgage .

That 's the inescapable conclusion emerging from the Obama administrations white paper on possible remedies for the two ailing giants of housing finance " Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac " along with events underway in the national economy . <p> The administrations long-delayed housing report , released Feb. 11 , drew a mix of catcalls and mild applause . Apartment developers praised the reports emphasis on expanding opportunities for people to rent their housing as opposed to the idea that homeownership is something for everybody . <p> Big banks and their allies in Congress welcomed the prospect that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac " which together account for about 60% of the mortgage market but have cost taxpayers a net $150 billion in bailout money in the last three years " will be heading into oblivion . Consumer and real estate industry groups lamented the phase-out of Fannie and Freddie , both of which supplied steady streams of mortgage money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report offered not only options for Congress to consider in winding down the two companies but also recommendations on more immediate transition measures to achieve a smaller federal footprint in the mortgage market . Some of these transitional steps require no congressional approval , and therefore are likely to affect borrowers and home buyers in the months ahead . Factor these changes into your timing for any loan application or purchase you 're contemplating this year : <p> Higher insurance fees on Federal Housing Administration mortgages " another quarter of a percentage point on annual premiums . That 's vitally important to consumers with moderate incomes and assets , especially in the African American and Hispanic communities where FHA loans are the dominant route to homeownership . The report also hints at a possible increase in minimum down payments for FHA loans " currently just 3.5% " but provided no specifics . Congressional approval would be required for any change . <p> Significant reductions in maximum loan amounts later this year for both FHA and conventional loans eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac , unless Congress votes to retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expiration Oct. 1 . Loans above each local markets limit " whatever the reduced ceiling turns out to be " will be considered jumbos and will come with higher interest rates from private lenders . <p> Raising the fees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac charge lenders to guarantee pools of their mortgages for resale to bond investors . Lenders will automatically pass those on to borrowers as a cost of doing business . The report also calls for raising down payment requirements at Fannie and Freddie to 10% . <p> Retaining the controversial and costly add-on fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that can increase the expense of obtaining even a moderate-size mortgage by thousands of dollars . These add-ons extend to applicants with FICO credit scores of 800 and above who are making substantial down payments . The white paper actually applauded the imposition of these fees , calling them one of several first steps on the path to weaning consumers off reliance on Fannie and Freddie for mortgage money . <p> The administration not only wants to wind down the two companies over the coming several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FHAs role " cutting its market share from around 30% today to as low as 10% . Where will the buyers who depend upon the FHA for affordable financing turn when that sharp cut has been accomplished ? That 's not clear . <p> The white paper makes an oblique reference to a major issue bubbling on the back burner that could also push rates up : Regulators are debating what should be a " qualified residential mortgage " under the terms of last years financial reform legislation . Loans that are n't  qualified " in terms of down payment size and other criteria " will require extra investments by lenders when they pool them into bonds ; that in turn could raise rates for nonqualified mortgages as much as 3 percentage points . <p> One proposal is to make 20% to 30% down payments the minimum to meet the qualified test . Under the worst-case scenario , you 'll be charged significantly higher rates if you have only enough for a small down payment . <p> Bottom line : Get ready to pay more for mortgages , no matter what happens to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .

At the same time , they may also be required to set aside sizable portions of their drawdowns to handle property taxes and hazard insurance for years to come . As early as next month , some applicants will also be required to pay substantially higher FHA insurance premiums if they pull out hefty amounts upfront at closing . <p> Reverse mortgages are limited to homeowners 62 and older , and allow them to use the equity in their properties to provide funds for their retirement years . Borrowers need not repay their principal balances " plus compounded interest charges " until they move from the home , sell it or die . <p> The FHAs insured reverse-mortgage program , which is hawked aggressively by TV pitchmen including former Tennessee Sen.- Fred Thompson- and actors Henry " the Fonz " Winkler and- Robert Wagner , dominates the field .

They estimate that the maximum drawdowns seniors can obtain will be reduced about 15% compared with the standard version of the program that has now been phased out . <p> Borrowers who take more than 60% of the maximum amounts available to them upfront will also pay substantially higher insurance premiums . The changes are likely to reduce the attractiveness of reverse mortgages to large numbers of seniors , according to some industry specialists . <p> Matt Neumeyer , owner of Premier Reverse Mortgage in Atlanta , estimates that as many as 40% of previously eligible borrowers will look at the reduced limits , the new financial assessments and higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youre offering me less on my house for a whole lot more hassle " " that 's how clients will see it , Neumeyer said in an interview .

For a 70-year-old owner with a $200,000 house , the standard version of the program would have offered a total " principal limit " " the amount available to the borrower " of $132,600 . Under the revised program , that will be cut nearly $20,000 to $112,800 , provided that the applicant can make it through the financial assessment hoops . And if the borrower wants to pull down more than 60% of what 's available , he or she will get hit by higher mortgage insurance premiums .

Is your bank unresponsive when you complain that your escrow account is fouled up and making your monthly payments needlessly high ? <p> Did your loan officer switch you into a more costly home loan than you were promised ? Or worse yet , did your home loan servicer ignore you when you told him you 've had an unexpected drop in income and needed a modification to avoid missing payments ? <p> If any of these situations sound familiar , here 's a heads-up about the newest and least-publicized source of federal help : the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus home mortgage complaint and dispute resolution hotline . Never heard of it ? That 's not surprising since it went live only Dec. 1 and the bureau has n't  said much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mortgage issues that American consumers have with their lenders rather than get overwhelmed . <p> The complaint hotline is accessible online athttp : **26;27;TOOLONG and by toll-free phone between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m . Eastern at ( 855 ) 411-2372 . <p> The bureau was created by last years Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation and is supposed to look out for your interests in banking , financial products , home loans and all other forms of consumer credit . Its mortgage complaint service is an extension of the agencys existing hotline for credit card-related disputes and inquiries , which began July 21 . <p> So far , according to the bureau , the credit card hotline has handled 5,074 complaints . Of this total , 84% were referred directly to the card issuers " mainly big banks " for resolution . Some complaints came with incomplete information or were referred to other agencies for action . About 74% of the complaints were subsequently reported back from banks as resolved , and 71% of the resolutions were not disputed by the consumers who lodged the complaints . Just under 13% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the card issuers actions . <p> The credit card complaint service is likely to provide a template for the consumer bureaus approach to mortgage problems , which are expected to be more voluminous . When a borrower submits a formal complaint to the bureau , complete with account numbers and other key identifiers , the information will be sent immediately to the lender or mortgage servicer named in the complaint using a secure Web portal . <p> The lender must then review the information , contact the customer if needed and determine what action to take to resolve the matter . Next , the lender is supposed to report its action " if any " to the bureau , which sends it on to the borrower for review . Throughout the process , according to the bureau , borrowers can log onto the agencys " secure consumer portal or call the toll-free number to receive updates , provide additional information and review responses " from the lender . <p> If the dispute focuses on what is primarily a matter of state regulation or is beyond the purview of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarly , if the dispute points to fraud or identity theft , the bureau is likely to refer it to either a federal or a state law enforcement authority . For the time being , the bureau is referring all complaints involving small banks or their subsidiaries that have less than $10 billion in assets to other agencies . <p> In the mortgage field , however , the vast majority of loan originations and servicing are controlled by the top 10 largest banks or their subsidiaries , which means that a high percentage of the complaints received are likely to be handled by the bureau . <p> How is this going to work in practice ? Though consumer groups are optimistic , and the bureau says its staffed and ready to go , some mortgage industry leaders worry that the agency could be taking on more than it can realistically handle and raising borrower expectations that ca n't be met . <p> David H. Stevens , president and chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. , said that while he has found the bureau to be " fairly thoughtful " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is " concerned that they are moving too quickly too soon . " If the bureau is not properly equipped to handle large volumes of emails and calls , the service could be " an investigatory black hole " where complaints are filed but not addressed quickly or adequately , and it could be " a net negative " for borrowers who have genuine problems , Stevens said . <p> Since the agency is expected to report on the initial months results sometime early in 2012 , Stevens and consumers should have answers fairly soon . Meanwhile , if you 've got a legitimate complaint , give the hotline a shot .

Start with interest rates . <p> With an almost-certain increase in rates on the horizon when the- Federal Reserve- begins to taper its purchases of mortgage bonds and Treasury securities , fixed rates on 10-year loans remain enticingly low . According to MyBankTracker.com , which surveys 7,000 lenders nationwide on rates and terms , the average 10-year fixed-rate mortgage goes for 3% with a fifth of a point . ( A point equals 1% of the loan amount . ) <p> But many community banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banks current rate for a 10-year , whether for refinancing or a home purchase , is 2.375% with no points . Third Federals quote for a $200,000 10-year mortgage is 2.79% with a closing fee of $450 . <p> For community lending institutions such as these around the country , 10-year loans tend to be portfolio investments . Rather than selling the mortgages to Freddie Mac , - Fannie Mae- or other investors , lenders retain them in-house . Partially as a result , rates can be lower .

The rate on the 30-year fixed is 3.99% ; on a 15-year , it is 3.25% . <p> Monthly payments . here 's where the shorter term and faster payoff of principal available through the 10-year mortgage can be a budget issue for some borrowers . The monthly total for principal and interest on the 30-year loan is just $715 . On the 15-year its $1,054 . But on the 10-year its nearly double what youd pay on the 30-year " $1,406 . Though over the term of the loan you pay substantially less in total interest charges , on a monthly basis the 10-year requires the most out of pocket of the three . <p> Frank Nothaft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a retirement planning process designed to leave you with lower debts at a predetermined point , a 10-year mortgage " could be an ideal product , " provided you 've got the resources to handle the higher monthly payments .

That 's roughly the same as the previous year . <p> But add in the $41 billion spent by immigrants who moved here within the last two years and individuals with visas of more than six months , and the total is $82 billion worth of U.S. residential real estate taken off the market by international buyers , up from $66 billion the year before . <p> The demand for American real estate is so strong that last fall , the Realtors association launched an international version of its listing website .

And in markets where foreign buyers are most active , their pesos , pounds and rupees are being welcomed with open arms because they are helping unclog the logjam of unsold and foreclosed houses , a jam-up many believe must be cleared before residential real estate can regain its equilibrium . <p> " At a time when there are a lot of homes on the market and an overhang of distressed properties , an active foreign demand relieves these worries , " says Michael Fratantoni , vice president of research at the Mortgage Bankers Assn . <p> While most states have some international buyers , the Realtors group says foreigners are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas and Arizona .

According to the latest quarterly survey by the Mortgage Bankers Assn. , FHA delinquencies rose to 12.4% , compared with a 4.1% average for prime ( Fannie MaeFreddie Mac ) conventional fixed-rate mortgages and 6.6% for VA loans . <p> As a result , the FHA is under the gun " with Congress and within the Obama administration " to get its own house in order , cut insurance claims and rebuild its reserves . The upcoming squeezes on seller contributions and bumps in premiums are steps in this direction . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country where closing costs and home prices are relatively high . <p> Heres what 's involved : Traditionally the FHA has been uniquely generous in allowing home sellers " including builders marketing new construction " to sweeten the pot for purchasers by chipping in money to defray closing costs . The FHA now allows sellers to pay up to 6% of the price of the house toward their buyers closing expenses . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , by comparison , cap contributions at 3% . The VAs ceiling is 4% . <p> Under newly proposed rules , the FHA cap would drop to the greater of 3% of the home price or $6,000 . In sales involving houses priced at $100,000 or less , this would n't change anything ( $6,000 equals 6% of $100,000 ) . But on all sales above this threshold , the squeeze would get progressively tighter . <p> On a $200,000 home , a buyer could today ask the seller to pay for $12,000 of a long list of settlement charges including all prepaid loan expenses , discount points on the loan , interest rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the proposed cutback , the maximum amount would be slashed in half . <p> On many home transactions , the reductions would force sellers to lower their prices to enable cash-short buyers to get through the closing . In other cases , sales might simply be too far of a stretch for some purchasers . <p> The proposed cuts are open to public comment through the end of this month but are highly likely to be adopted in much the same form soon afterward . The FHA also is restricting the types of " closing costs " that sellers can pay . Six months or a years worth of interest payments or homeowner association dues in advance no longer will be permitted " a serious blow to many builders who use these as financial carrots . <p> Beyond these changes , FHA also plans significant increases in insurance premiums " upfront premiums will rise to 1.75% from 1% , effective April 1 , and annual premiums will increase by 0.1% on all loans under $625,000 and 0.35% on mortgage amounts above that , effective June 1 . <p> William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Conn. , which does a sizable percentage of its business with the FHA , said the cumulative effect of all these increases " will not just crowd first-time buyers out of the FHA market , it will prevent them from owning a home that , absent these new costs , would be affordable .

For instance , if your house is worth $500,000 and the balance on your first mortgage is $375,000 , youd probably be limited to a second mortgage or credit line of $50,000 . <p> Contrast this with 2007 , the high-point year of home-equity lending , when many lenders offered " piggyback " financing packages that allowed 100% debt without private mortgage insurance . A buyer of a $500,000 house could get a $400,000 first mortgage and a second loan of $100,000 . <p> That ultimately did n't  work well for the banks .

If you 've got a delinquency-pocked credit history and you want to pull out a substantial amount of equity using a credit line , do n't  count on getting anywhere near the best rate quotes or terms available . <p> To illustrate , say you own a house in Los Angeles worth $600,000 with a $400,000 first mortgage balance , and you want a $100,000 equity credit line . <p> Wells Fargos online equity loan calculator quoted a floating-rate " home equity account " for 10 years at 4.75% in mid-April for borrowers with " excellent " credit .

This raises the potential costs to the bank if a borrower goes delinquent during a period when values are in decline . <p> Some jurisdictions also have special add-on costs that factor into quotes , such as mortgage taxes , and these can raise pricing quotes slightly . <p> Despite the multibillion-dollar losses that Bank of America and other large lenders have racked up on their equity loan portfolios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potere are convinced that this time around , things will be different thanks to smarter underwriting . <p> Bottom line : If you 've got equity in your house , have a need for cash in a lump sum or credit line and can get through the underwriting hoops and snares set by loss-leery lenders , go for it .

At least one state has a partial remedy for congressional inaction , however : California owners who sell homes through short sales are not subject to taxation on the amounts forgiven , a legal interpretation confirmed by the IRS . <p> Also part of the housing benefits that Congress failed to extend in December : A $2,000 tax credit for construction of energy-efficient new homes , deductions for home improvements that conserve energy , and write-offs for the mortgage insurance premiums that many borrowers pay in connection with low down payment loans . <p> Though Wyden is planning to take up an extenders bill soon , that does not guarantee that any specific tax law provision will be part of the bill the Finance Committee ultimately considers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be part of a final package , which may or may not include all the housing-related provisions .

Most tax analysts expect that a final bill will include some form of renewal . <p> The home energy conservation tax programs also are likely to be included in the Senate bill , in part because Wyden has supported them in the past and recently served as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee . <p> Meanwhile , in the House , Camp has not indicated when he plans to take up the extenders .

Harney , LA Times <p> January 30 , 2011 <p> Reporting from Washington <p> After years of virtual exile from the home loan arena , is the adjustable-rate mortgage staging a quiet comeback ? Could an ARM be on your shopping list the next time you need to buy a house or refinance ? <p> You might be surprised . <p> A new survey of 112 lenders by mortgage giant Freddie Mac found that ARMs are starting to attract applicants again . Adjustables accounted for just 3% of new home loans in early 2009 but are projected to be picked by nearly 1 out of 10 borrowers in 2011 . In the jumbo and super-jumbo segments , the share will be even larger , according to Freddie Mac chief economist Frank Nothaft . <p> How could this be , with fixed 30-year rates at half-century lows , hovering just under 5% ? Isnt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed rate for as long as possible rather than gamble on a loan whose rate might bounce around in the years ahead ? <p> That logic still holds up for most people , but not for everybody . here 's why . The boom-era models of the ARM have pretty much disappeared " there are no more of the two-year adjustables that hooked record numbers of consumers in 2003 and 2004 with teaser rates that needed to be refinanced with heavy fees within 24 months . No more " pick-a-pay " ARMs that were mass-marketed with loosey-goosey underwriting and the potential for negative amortization . <p> The most popular ARM in the market today , according to the Freddie Mac survey , is the 5-1 hybrid . Its rate is fixed for the first five years of the loan , then adjusts annually for as much as the next 25 years , with rate caps to cushion payment shocks if rates suddenly soar . There are also 7-1 and 3-1 hybrids . The antique one-year ARM still is available but does n't  get a lot of takers . <p> The real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pricing . Rates are significantly lower than fixed 30-year alternatives , with no teasers or negative amortization involved . In some cases , they also come with other attractive terms , such as more flexible underwriting standards . <p> According to data supplied by Dan Green , a loan officer with Waterstone Mortgage Corp . in Cincinnati and author of TheMortgageReports.com blog , the rate spread between 5-1 hybrid ARMs and 30-year fixed-rate loans has widened to around 1.625 percentage points . <p> To illustrate , say you 're interested in a $250,000 conventional loan to buy a house . Youve got a FICO credit score of 740 and want to close in 45 days . You could opt for a 30-year fixed loan at 4.75% , requiring a monthly principal and interest payment of $1,304 . Alternatively , you could opt for a 5-1 ARM fixed at 3.125% , costing $1,071 in principal and interest per month " a $233 saving . <p> But now check out the niche where hybrid ARMs really shine : jumbo and super-jumbo mortgages .

According to Green , you should be able to get a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo for around 5.625% . Monthly principal and interest on a fixed-rate jumbo would total $2,590 a month . <p> Compare that with a $450,000 hybrid 5-1 ARM : 3.5% for the initial five years , requiring $2,020 a month in principal and interest . That 's a rate spread of 2.125 points " " the best we 've seen in years , " Green said . " Its very aggressively priced " by banks that want to originate the loans to hold in their own portfolios . <p> The savings go even higher in the super-jumbo space " a $1-million 5-1 ARM goes for 3.5% and saves a borrower $1,266 a month compared with a competing fixed-rate 30-year loan at 5.6% . <p> Cathy Warshawsky , president and senior loan officer of Bay Area Loan Inc. in San Jose , cites another advantage for some jumbo borrowers " special enhancements in payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $950,000 mortgage at the lowest rate and monthly payment .

Start with interest rates . <p> With an almost-certain increase in rates on the horizon when the- Federal Reserve- begins to taper its purchases of mortgage bonds and Treasury securities , fixed rates on 10-year loans remain enticingly low . According to MyBankTracker.com , which surveys 7,000 lenders nationwide on rates and terms , the average 10-year fixed-rate mortgage goes for 3% with a fifth of a point . ( A point equals 1% of the loan amount . ) <p> But many community banks and smaller lenders quote much lower than that . Rockville Banks current rate for a 10-year , whether for refinancing or a home purchase , is 2.375% with no points .

Rather than selling the mortgages to Freddie Mac , - Fannie Mae- or other investors , lenders retain them in-house . Partially as a result , rates can be lower . And since lenders who specialize in 10-year mortgages want to keep risks as low as possible on their in-house investments , they typically require borrowers to have solid credit histories and significant equity or down payments . <p> Picture this : Youre in your prime pre-retiree years " anywhere from the mid-50s to early 60s . Youve got a good income , significant equity in your home , good credit scores and you want to refinance to a lower rate . Your home is worth $250,000 and you need a $150,000 loan that will leave you mortgage debt-free " or close to it " once you 're into retirement . You do n't  want to risk potential interest rate spikes along the way , so adjustable-rate loans are out of the question . <p> How does a 10-year loan stack up ? Consider this comparative scenario using current rates and terms for 30-year , 15-year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgages at Rockville Bank : <p> Interest rates : The 10-years 2.375% rate is the lowest by far .

The monthly total for principal and interest on the 30-year loan is just $715 . On the 15-year its $1,054 . But on the 10-year its nearly double what youd pay on the 30-year " $1,406 . Though over the term of the loan you pay substantially less in total interest charges , on a monthly basis the 10-year requires the most out of pocket of the three . <p> Frank Nothaft , chief economist for Freddie Mac , says that as part of a retirement planning process designed to leave you with lower debts at a predetermined point , a 10-year mortgage " could be an ideal product , " provided you 've got the resources to handle the higher monthly payments .

California is a nonjudicial state . Among the worst performers were Florida markets such as- Tampa- and Fort Myers , as well as parts of Illinois and Wisconsin .

" It shows the devastation some seniors have gone through since the financial downturn . " <p> Reverse mortgages " which allow homeowners to borrow against the value of their homes " have been around since the early 1960s , but have grown in popularity . TV commercials with celebrities such as Henry Winkler , Robert Wagner and Fred Thompson promoting reverse mortgages , are rampant during weekends and late night viewing hours . <p> Its not surprising that more seniors are doing this at an earlier age , " says Karl Byrd , CFP , vice president at Security Ballew Wealth Management . " We live in a time when people are not planning for their retirement or can even get out of debt . Some seniors cant even buy groceries right now . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the growing number of seniors , poor or not , says Gregg Smith , COO of the lending firm , One Reverse Mortgage . <p> " Weve noticed the age range for reverse mortgages getting younger for us , " Smith says . " But when you figure that some 10,000 people a day reach 62 in the U.S. , were seeing this grow among all seniors and believe it will get even bigger in the next 10 years . " <p> Another selling point for reverse mortgages is the gain of respectability . <p> " Those ads aside , reverse mortgages are getting rid of the bad reputation they 've had in the past , " says Mark Goldman , a real estate professor at San Diego State University and a real estate investor , who 's handled reverse mortgages for some of his clients " including his in-laws . <p> " The loans are backed by the government and more financial planners are looking at them as a viable option for their clients , " Goldman goes on to say . " With mortgage rates low , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> How a reverse mortgage works is fairly simple . Designed for those 62 or older , a homeowner gets a lump sum or a payout for the equity in their house . The loan , with interest , does not have to be repaid until the last surviving homeowner moves out of the property or passes away . <p> There 's no income or credit check and even if a senior is in foreclosure " and as long as the house has equity " they are eligible . All who apply must meet with an independent home loan counselor to discuss the ins and outs of getting a reverse mortgage . <p> Reverse mortgage loans are not taxable , and generally do n't affect Social Security- benefits . Most loans have adjustable rates and can be re-financed , while some have fixed rates . <p> But they do come with a price tag and tight restrictions . Previous loans have to be paid off . Closing costs can add up " the average is about $2,000 to $3,000 depending on location . And there 's no free ride when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be paid by the homeowners to keep the house . <p> Homeowners must use the house as their main residence , and if the homeowner dies or wants to sell , the proceeds must go to pay off the loan . <p> Another warning signal " reverse loans can use up all or most of the equity and leave seniors with fewer assets as they grow older . And the loans are geared toward older seniors . The older someone is , the more credit is available . That 's why most reverse mortgages have been taken out by people in their 70s . That is until now . <p> " Weaker economic conditions are pushing younger seniors to go for any amount of money they can get at an earlier age , " says Timmerman . <p> " The people we surveyed in the younger age range applying for the loans were clear about their needs for financial help , " Timmerman says . " They did n't  seem like they could wait . " <p> " I saw a an older woman at the drugstore the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her medicine , " Goldman adds . " When you see seniors facing rising health care costs , and as they lose jobs and see 401(k) returns shrink , its going to be tough not to look at a reverse loan .

Overall , nearly half the homeowners who entered the program since it launched in March of last year have dropped out . <p> Many had hoped the $75-billion program would be a silver bullet to the foreclosure problem , but its turned out to be a dud , said independent banking analyst Bert Ely . That 's not surprising , he said , given the depth of the housing market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Even with a substantial reduction in mortgage payment and even some reduction in principal , you still have people who are over their head financially because of their reduced financial circumstances , " Ely said .

" <p> The Los Angeles-Orange County area continued to have the most active trial and permanent modifications under the program , with 44,617 total modifications in July , or 6.6% of the national total . But that was down from 48,846 total modifications in June . <p> The Inland Empire was third nationwide , with 35,169 total modifications in July , or 5.2% of the total . <p> So far , 434,716 homeowners nationwide have received permanent modifications since the program began last year . The pace had picked up significantly starting in December after administration officials began pressuring mortgage servicers to convert more three-month trials under the program into permanent modifications . <p> The number of permanent modifications nearly tripled from January to May . Even in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modified mortgages were added . <p> During the second quarter of the year , there were a record 269,952 home foreclosures , up 38% from the same period a year earlier , according to Irvine research firm RealtyTrac .

Homeowners who qualify first get a three-month trial modification with lower payments . If they make those payments , the modification can be made permanent . Only at that point does the servicer get the incentive payment . <p> The administrations stated goal was to modify 3 million to 4 million mortgages through 2012 . <p> The pace of new , temporary mortgage modifications under the program slowed in July , increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trial modifications started since the program began have been canceled . In addition , 12,912 permanent modifications have been canceled , mostly because the homeowner missed at least three straight payments . <p> Increasing numbers of cancellations were the latest problem for the administrations modification program , which has been plagued by complaints from homeowners of bureaucratic runarounds by servicers , including lost paperwork and unreturned phone calls . <p> Herbert M. Allison Jr. , the Treasury Departments assistant secretary for financial stability , said the administration expected cancellations to continue as mortgage servicers work through earlier modifications that were made without documentation . Those stated-income modifications were needed last year because so many people were in need of quick foreclosure assistance , he said . <p> Many of the homeowners who got those early modifications under the program were removed because it turned out they " did not meet the qualifications for various reasons , such as income levels or the fact that they were not in the home itself , " Allison said . <p> But many of those who were canceled out of the program have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . <p> For the eight largest mortgage servicers , including Bank of America , CitiMortgage and Wells Fargo Bank , 45% of homeowners whose trial modifications were cancelled received an alternative modification . Wells Fargo reported Friday that 87% of the 520,399 active modifications it had done from Jan. 1 to July 31 were through its own programs . <p> Administration officials said the housing market had stabilized significantly since Obama took office in January 2009 , and stressed that homeowners with permanent modifications had a median payment reduction of 36% , or more than $500 a month . <p> But Bostic said administration officials are not " in happy land " and that the market was not yet " out of the woods . " <p> Ely said one flaw with the administrations modification program is that it does not adequately take into account all the other debts faced by homeowners . <p> " Theres been this hype that you could wave a magic wand , change a few things with the mortgage payment and everything would be hunky-dory , " Ely said .

Plus it would give you an idea about whether the appraiser is locally based and thus knowledgeable about neighborhood sales and listing trends , or has traveled from another part of the state . <p> Information like this can be crucial in an environment in which home sellers , buyers and realty agents routinely complain about botched appraisals that complicate or kill deals by coming in thousands of dollars below the contract price . In many cases , critics say , appraisers continue to inappropriately select distressed-sale comparables to value non-distressed transactions in areas where property values are rising . In a May survey of its members , the National Assn. of Realtors found that 33% of agents reported problems connected with appraisals that endangered sales . <p> The consumer bureau also wants to open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden from you : How much of your $450 to $600 in appraisal charges at closing will go to the appraiser , and how much will go to an unseen appraisal " management company " that may be owned by or affiliated with your lender and is also getting a cut of the action ? <p> In a proposal Aug. 16 , the bureau said under its plan mortgage lenders would be required to provide copies of all written appraisals and other data used in the valuation " promptly after receiving them , " but in no event later than three business days before the closing . This would include the electronic automated valuation models ( AVMs ) widely used by lenders and management companies to supplement standard reports . <p> AVMs , which depend on public records rather than on-site observations , have been criticized by some appraisers and realty agents as being tools to keep appraised values below contract prices agreed upon by sellers and buyers in rebounding markets .

He says appraisers often submit their reports to management companies only to hear back that an AVM has located alleged " comps " indicating that the value should be below what the appraiser reported . <p> In one recent appraisal assignment , Turner said , a banks management company told him to consider two lower-cost comparables identified by an AVM that would have significantly depressed the valuation he submitted . He refused , he said , because he knew the objective was simply to " push the value down " so that the bank could limit the loan amount . <p> The consumer bureau also has issued proposals for revisions to the current closing cost sheets used nationwide for real estate transactions . Among the changes : an option to include a breakout of the appraisal charges paid by borrowers . The first would be the amount that the appraiser receives .

In some cases , the appraisal charge may be $500 and the appraiser is being paid $200 to $250 " much less than the traditional fee before the advent of management companies . Critics connect these low payments with the rising level of complaints about incompetent appraisals , often performed by newcomers to the field or less experienced individuals who agree to work for less . <p> The consumer agencys proposals wont be finalized for months , but in the meantime you as a consumer can ask : Where are my appraisal payments going ? To the appraiser ? Or into the coffers of my lender ? If its the latter , what 's the justification for the charge ? The answers could be troubling .

@@24825003 @4825003/ <h> Lower home prices and lower interest rates mean that homeowners are writing off less mortgage interest than anticipated . <p> By Kenneth R. Harney LA Times <p> January 23 , 2011 <p> Reporting from Washington <p> Are you worried about the mortgage interest deduction going away ? After all , it 's a high-profile , high-cost target for federal budget cutters " and was prominently featured in the report of the presidential deficit-reduction commission late last year . Reformers have been trying to kill or at least clamp a ceiling on these write-offs for decades . <p> But here 's an intriguing twist that has just emerged on Capitol Hill and that might bring some encouragement to homeowners , realty agents and builders who strongly oppose any cutbacks in tax benefits . According to new estimates compiled by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation " Congress ' top technical resource on all tax law matters " the mortgage interest deduction is not quite as big a hole in the federal budget as previously estimated . <p> In fact , it 's significantly lower " $88 billion less in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years " than the committee estimated early in 2010 . That 's big money , even in an era of trillion-dollar deficits . Why the sudden reappraisal of the revenue losses caused by millions of homeowners writing off their mortgage interest ? <p> For starters , there 's less mortgage interest being written off than earlier statistical models had anticipated . Home values are down in many parts of the country , and lower purchase prices and far stricter underwriting mean smaller mortgage amounts . Interest rates have hit half-century record lows , and have remained at or near those floors for much longer than anyone had estimated . <p> Thirty-year mortgages at 4.5% obviously require much less in monthly interest payments than do similar loans at 5.5% and 6% . Millions of homeowners who had been paying even higher rates than that have refinanced in the last year " the combined effect of which has been to reduce the estimated amounts of interest being written off now and for the next couple of years at least . <p> For example , the tax committee last January predicted that mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total close to $120 billion . Now the estimate is $93.8 billion . <p> These are brain-bending big numbers , but the fact is this : It appears that the revenue-loss costs of this jumbo-sized tax benefit for homeowners will be less than anyone expected . In the politically sensitive world of federal budget deficit reform , every lower loss is a better loss " and one that presumably needs less reform . <p> The committee 's new projections have also turned up some other intriguing and previously unreported facts about key tax benefits for buyers and owners . For example , although the popular first-time home buyer tax credit programs of 2008 and 2009 that stimulated millions of purchases were net revenue drains for the government during fiscal 2010 , they are morphing into revenue-raisers " to the tune of $6.5 billion from 2011 through 2013 . <p> There are two factors at work : The first credit , enacted as part of the 2008 emergency economic stimulus legislation , was for a maximum $7,500 or 10% of the house price . But it was more of an interest-free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program , buyers are required to make annual repayment installments of 62/3% of the credit they claimed over the next 15 years " and they 're beginning to do so . <p> But it 's not just those 2008 buyers who will be paying higher taxes . The two subsequent home buyer credit programs enacted by Congress " $8,000 for first-time purchasers and $6,500 for repeat buyers " did not require repayments . But both programs came with strict rules that experts believe will add to revenue collected by the Internal Revenue Service during the years 2011 through 2013 . <p> For instance , Congress required that credits claimed under the $8,000 and $6,500 legislation be repaid if the owners do not continually use their house as a principal residence for 36 months after the purchase . Say you took the $8,000 credit on your 2009 federal tax filing , but then decided to sell the house or turn it into a rental investment in 2011 . You owe the government $8,000 the day you make that move " and the IRS says it has increasingly sophisticated audit programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other rule violations requiring paybacks and even penalties . <p> Bottom line , by the committee 's estimates : Homeowner tax benefits will still represent large contributors to the federal deficit . But for a variety of reasons , those costs should be smaller " and , in theory , slightly less vulnerable to attack " for the years immediately ahead .

" The bill would loosen the process for providing a notarys seal to documents and allow them to be done electronically . <p> Obama will not sign a bill that would allow foreclosure and other documents to be accepted among multiple states . Consumer advocates and state officials had argued the legislation would make it difficult for homeowners to challenge foreclosure documents prepared in other states . <p> The White House said Thursday it is sending the bill back to Congress for revisions , and that the administration would work with lawmakers on it . <p> O.

It essentially takes effect when the president fails to sign a bill within 10 days . Obama has yet to issue a traditional veto during his presidency ; he has used a pocket veto once before , in December 2009 , to address what amounted to a technicality on a defense spending bill . <p> A furor has been growing as mounting evidence has surfaced that mortgage lenders have been evicting homeowners using flawed court papers .

Many banks use so-called robo signers , employees who sign hundreds of documents a day , without carefully reviewing their contents , when foreclosing on homes .

The Dodd-Frank law designates the consumer bureau as the federal governments drafter of rules spelling out what constitutes a qualified mortgage . <p> Among major players in the mortgage field , the FHA is the only one that requires full-month interest payoffs. - Fannie Mae , - Freddie Mac- and the Department of Veterans Affairs all stop collecting interest on the day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FHAs practice has drawn congressional and real estate trade group criticism , most recently from Sen.- Benjamin L.

Harney , LA TimesApril 24 , 2011 <p> Reporting from Washington " <p> Is the- Federal Housing Administration- losing some of its post-boom , post-bust oomph ? Is the- Obama- administrations plan to gradually throttle back the FHAs home mortgage insurance volume already having effects " and if so , what might this mean to you as a buyer ? There are definitely signs that something is brewing : <p> Total applications for FHA-insured single-family mortgages are down 30% year over year through March , according to the agencys data . Applications from prospective home purchasers are down 35% . The FHAs popularity with buyers previously had sustained its high origination volumes . <p> The FHA put its second increase in premium charges in six months into effect April 18 . Higher premiums mean higher monthly payment requirements for buyers and could have the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market entirely . <p> The private mortgage insurance industry , which competes with the FHA for borrowers who make small down payments , is touting its newly resurgent conventional mortgage products , which may offer significant monthly savings compared with the FHA . <p> Some of the agencys long-standing advocates are wondering aloud whether the administrations policy tilt toward more private-sector involvement in the mortgage arena may be hurting first-time buyers who ca n't bring large cash resources or high credit scores to the table . <p> " Here you have our last refuge for ordinary people to buy a home , and the government is making it tougher to qualify " by raising insurance premiums , said Mario Yeaman , senior loan officer for Milestone Mortgage in Manhattan Beach . <p> Brian Chappelle , a principal of Potomac Partners , a mortgage banking industry consulting firm in Washington , D.C. , said he worried about the direction the FHA had begun pursuing . " FHAs role was designed to be the first rung on the homeownership ladder . If you raise fees , increase down payments and lower mortgage limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the economy . " <p> Chappelles concern about higher down payments stems from the Obama administrations February " white paper " on housing reform in which policymakers called for higher down payments across the board " including at the FHA . To date , no increases have been proposed by the agency , but some analysts believe that a move to a 5% minimum down payment " up from the current 3.5% " would not be surprising in the months ahead . The FHAs maximum loan amounts might also drop significantly in October if Congress does not renew the economic recovery law ceilings , which now top out in high-cost areas at $729,750 . <p> Given these developments , how does FHA financing stack up against rivals in the low-down-payment space ? Private mortgage insurers have a quick response : They say their lower monthly costs already are winning back some of the business they lost to the FHA during the recession . <p> For instance , Radian Guaranty Inc. , a major home loan insurer , claims that in the wake of the FHAs premium increases , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15% lower than FHA-insured mortgages for borrowers with FICO credit scores above 720 . <p> Radian provided this cost-comparison example to illustrate : Say you 've got a FICO score above 720 , and you need a $285,000 , 30-year loan with 5% down at a 5% interest rate . The FHA mortgage would cost $1,806 in principal and interest a month . The same loan insured by Radian would cost from $1,530 to $1,753 a month , depending on the type of premium payment plan you chose . <p> Brien McMahon , chief franchise officer of Radian , said that as a general rule , private insurance on low-down-payment loans would beat the FHA whenever the buyer put down 5% and had a 720 or higher FICO score or put down 10% and had at least a 680 FICO . <p> So does this mean that all buyers with low down payments should abandon the FHA and switch to conventional loans ? Hardly . David Van Waldick of Western Realty Finance in Carlsbad , Calif. , said the majority of FHA users could n't fit into the private insurers high-FICO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The FHA , by contrast , continues to offer much higher and more flexible maximum debt-to-income ratios , far more generous underwriting and lower down payments , and will accept FICO scores that conventional lenders and private insurers wo n't touch . <p> Bottom line : If you 're purchasing a home with a small down payment , check out both the FHA and the private alternative with your loan officer . Its true that the FHA has just gotten a little more expensive . But it may still have the total package you need to do the deal . <p> Those reports are not bad , but not great either . Despite slight upticks in home sales and construction , the housing sector is still in the doldrums as supply continues to far outweigh demand for homes . <p> " Even as buyers scoop up deals of a lifetime , the river of foreclosed properties continues to flow , " Douglas Porter , deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets , said in a note to investors Wednesday morning . <p> The median home price slipped 5.9% to $159,600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some buyers are still finding it tough to get a mortgage , Lawrence Yun , chief economist for the National Association of Realtors , said in a release . The average credit score to get a conventional mortgage has risen to 760 from 720 in 2007 . <p> " Although home sales are coming back without a federal stimulus , sales would be notably stronger if mortgage lending would return to the normal , safe standards that were in place a decade ago before the loose lending practices that created the unprecedented boom and bust cycle , " he said . <p> First-time buyers purchased 33% of homes in March , down from 44% in March 2010 . Investors accounted for 22% of sales , up from 19% a year ago . <p> All-cash sales were at a record high in March , accounting for 35% of existing home sales . <p> The report was roughly in line with economists forecasts for home sales to grow at an annual rate of 5 million. - <p> The IMF , in an analysis of housing finance systems around the world , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward needed changes in the U.S. mortgage system .

" It is clear that an overhaul is needed . " <p> " As a first step , we would very much recommend that the U.S. would at least cap the- mortgage interest deductability , " said Ann-Margret Westin , an IMF senior economist and one of the authors of the housing report . She approved of the recommendation by the U.S. fiscal commission to halve the mortgage limit for deductions and to let it apply only to private residences , but the IMF said any such move would have to be undertaken over time . <p> The report is one chapter of the IMFs larger annual Global Financial Stability Report that will be published in full next week . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing finance throughout rich countries exacerbated house-price swings and amplified- mortgage- credit growth during the run-up to the crisis .

The popping of the housing market helped to spark the global credit crisis . <p> " The faster you grow , the harder you fall , " said Westin . <p> The U.S. has a long tradition of providing government support for housing through government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , the Federal Housing Administration and other government agencies .

" It did not recommend a specific approach for the U.S. other than to say the role of Fannie and Freddie " should be reassessed . " <p> The report said that there " is a need for better-defined and more transparent government participation in the housing market , with all such policy measures , including strict affordable housing policy goals , transparently shown in the governments budget .

Harney , LA Times <p> April 10 , 2011 <p> Reporting from Washington <p> You may have seen reports that the federal government is proposing new mortgage finance rules under which only home purchasers who can afford a minimum 20% down payment on a conventional loan would get a shot at the best interest rates and terms . <p> That is correct , and its deeply sobering news for large numbers of first-time and moderate-income buyers who ca n't come up with that much cash or afford to pay higher rates . <p> But some of the other requirements that federal agencies and the Obama administration are proposing in the same plan have gotten much less attention yet could prove just as troublesome for consumers : <p> Strict mandatory debt-to-income limits . Under the proposal , to get the best mortgage rates , you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monthly income on housing-related expenses , and you could n't have total monthly household debt that exceeds 36% of your income . <p> There would be no flexibility to go beyond these ceilings , unlike in todays marketplace , in which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac consider debt-to-income ratios along with other factors through their electronic underwriting systems . Freddie Mac , for example , has an overall debt-ratio limit of 45% of an applicants stable monthly income . <p> To refinance your existing mortgage and replace it with one carrying the best interest rate , youd need no less than a 25% equity stake in your house to qualify . If you sought to take any additional cash out through a refi , you would need 30% equity . Todays typical requirements for a conventional refi are nowhere near as strict . <p> Pristine credit standards . For example , if you were 60 days late on any credit account during the previous 24 months , you would be ineligible for a mortgage at the best terms . <p> These are all core features of what may be the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing and mortgage markets . The so-called " qualified residential mortgage , " or QRM , proposals were released at the end of March by banking , securities and housing regulators , along with the Department of Housing and Urban Development . The agencies were required by the 2010 financial reform legislation to come up with new standards for low-risk conventional mortgages . <p> Congress did not specify what a " safe " mortgage should look like but directed the agencies to consider such factors as full documentation of borrower income and assets plus avoidance of toxic features such as negative amortization and balloon payments . Congress was silent on the subject of minimum down payments . <p> Under the law , loans that do not meet the strict QRM tests will be pushed into a less-favored , higher-cost category : Banks and Wall Street securitizers would need to set aside 5% of loan balances in reserves to cover possible losses from defaults . This extra capital cost inevitably would be passed on to consumers . <p> Mortgage industry estimates of the interest rate differential between ultra-safe , QRM-qualifying loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 3 percentage points . In todays market , this would mean that mortgages that meet the federal agencies stringent new standards might go for 5% .

You cant quite fit into the tight confines of the QRMs debt-to-income ratio rule ? Pay up . <p> Where and when will this all start hitting the marketplace ? The proposals are out for public comment through June 10 and probably wont be put into effect until mid-2012 . The agencies proposal , though not the legislation , exempts mortgages sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from the rule as long as both remain under federal conservatorship " a date uncertain .

Plus , my choice of comparisons has more than political meaning . <p> If we forget how bad things were in 2008 , no matter our politics , we may end up with bad analysis or off-point future tactics or policies . <p> Bottom line in this math : Orange County home buying rose 11 percent in four years by no means a boom , but clearly progress .

So in 2009 , she attended a seminar to learn how to put her own skin in the game . <p> Soon afterward , she bought more than $20,000 in liens at auctions in foreclosure-riddled Florida that were promising to pay 17% to 18% in interest . Within two years , she got her entire investment back , plus double-digit returns . <p> " It was always a nice surprise to get a check in the mail , " said Norton , now 55 . <p> Now big institutional investors have joined individual investors .

For many state , county and local governments , the failure to collect on these debts weighs heavily on their already-overburdened budgets .

In return , the county gets the money it needs to fund schools , pave roads and pay for other infrastructure and services . <p> Homeowners who pay back what they owe , pay the county , which then repays the investor the principal , plus whatever interest rate was set at auction . <p> The interest is where the real money can be made. - States set rates that the counties can charge delinquent taxpayers on overdue taxes and they can range anywhere from 12% to 24% , according to Larry Loftis , an attorney , tax lien investor , and author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> There are several different kinds of tax lien auctions . In one of the most common methods , the winning bidder is the one who will accept the lowest interest rate .

" The biggest risk is getting a lien on a worthless property . Contrary to what you see and hear on the Get rich quick infomercials on tax lien investing , the county government- does not- guarantee your investment . " <p> Almost all counties that sell liens sell hundreds of them on worthless properties each year . That 's especially true in blighted inner-city neighborhoods where foreclosures have wrecked the housing market and many homes are selling for $10,000 or less .

" FHAs role was designed to be the first rung on the homeownership ladder . If you raise fees , increase down payments and lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future buyers and the economy . " <p> Chappelles concern about higher down payments stems from the Obama administrations February " white paper " on housing reform in which policymakers called for higher down payments across the board " including at the FHA .

The FHAs maximum loan amounts might also drop significantly in October if Congress does not renew the economic recovery law ceilings , which now top out in high-cost areas at $729,750 . <p> Given these developments , how does FHA financing stack up against rivals in the low-down-payment space ?

The FHA mortgage would cost $1,806 in principal and interest a month . The same loan insured by Radian would cost from $1,530 to $1,753 a month , depending on the type of premium payment plan you chose . <p> Brien McMahon , chief franchise officer of Radian , said that as a general rule , private insurance on low-down-payment loans would beat the FHA whenever the buyer put down 5% and had a 720 or higher FICO score or put down 10% and had at least a 680 FICO . <p> So does this mean that all buyers with low down payments should abandon the FHA and switch to conventional loans ? Hardly .

As the crucial spring season begins , lenders increasingly have begun to approve low down payments . <p> As housing heads into the critical spring market , credit is finally beginning to thaw . Lenders are increasingly approving low down payment loans , and government sponsored mortgage giant Fannie Mae is buying more of them . <p> It is a noticeable shift from the last four years , when 20 percent down on a home purchase loan was the only game in the neighborhood . <p> " In general lenders have been willing to do more than they may have been willing to do in the past , " said John Forlines , chief credit officer for Fannie Maes single family business . " Our requirements have not changed significantly , but other parties taking risk , the lenders and mortgage insurance companies in particular , have been more flexible than they may have been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as little as 3 percent down payment , but these loans require private mortgage insurance . During the worst of the housing crash , when the private insurers were sinking under billions of dollars in claims on defaulted loans , that insurance was tough to get . <p> The only low down payment loan left was through the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) " the governments loan insurer . The FHA took on a huge share of the market , far more than it was ever meant to , and while that helped prop up the mortgage market in the short term , it was not sustainable , and the FHA took on huge losses . <p> Now , facing a $16 billion shortfall , the FHA has raised premiums and will raise them yet again next month . FHA loans are becoming increasingly expensive . <p> Meanwhile , as the housing market improves , private mortgage insurers are starting to remove overlays on higher loan-to-value loans , meaning the percentage of the home value that is mortgaged . Low LTVs and high credit scores were the rule recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosening , making these loans cheaper than FHA . <p> " FHA is certainly becoming more expensive , " noted Craig Strent , CEO of Apex Home Loans in Bethesda , Maryland . " The increase in low down payments is reflective of first time buyers coming off the sidelines and entering the market . Were going to see more of this trend in the next couple of years as the economy improves and renters start to once again see the benefit of buying over renting . FHA has become more expensive and the mortgage insurance companies are the beneficiary of that , which is really not a bad thing as it means the private market is insuring the lower down payments rather than the government . " <p> The stocks of mortgage insurers like MGIC and Radian spiked in the first months of this year , as home prices improved and FHA policy changes designed to shrink its share of the market were announced . There is currently a bipartisan effort in the U.S. Senate to reduce the FHAs role , and in the House of Representatives a hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages the Federal Housing Administration has relative to private mortgage insurers and how those advantages contribute to the crowding out of private capital in housing finance , " according to the House Financial Services Committee release . <p> Despite the advantages , FHAs share is already shrinking , as Fannie Maes is rising . In the first quarter of 2012 , loans with between 3 and 10 percent down payment made up 15 percent of Fannie Maes business for home purchase loans ( not refinances ) . In the second quarter it rose to 17 percent and in the third to 18 percent . Fannie Mae has not reported its fourth quarter yet , but that share is expected to rise again . While a credit thaw is part of it , as mortgage interest rates rise and fewer borrowers apply to refinance , lenders are simply looking for more business . <p> The banks are also catching their collective breath now after years of raging refinances . Record-low mortgage rates had borrowers refinancing over and over , and that left little capacity or need for the banks to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With rates now rising to the highest level in six months , according to a report from the Mortgage Bankers Association Wednesday , the banks are seeing fewer refinances . <p> " Lenders , as traditionally happens , as they have more capacity , they might be willing to stretch their credit limits more , " said Forlines . <p> Lenders may also be responding to clearer guidelines from Fannie Mae on how it will determine which defaulted loans it can force the banks to buy back . Banks had to buy back billions of dollars worth of bad loans during the housing crash due to failures in so-called " reps and warrants " ( representations and warranties ) on loans it sold to Fannie Mae . <p> They are also just responding to more business , particularly from first time home buyers who have been largely on the sidelines until now . Improving employment and more confidence in home prices are bringing these buyers back . Since first-time buyers tend to be younger , they may not have large down payments . <p> " More first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen this more in our pre-approvals in terms of comparing FHA vs . PMI , " noted Strent . " Conventional options with PMI will become even more attractive when FHA premiums increase on April 1 . " <p> One wild card , however , is looming mortgage rules from Federal regulators that could require a minimum down payment for a loan to be considered a " qualified mortgage . " Only these loans could be sold in full to investors ; otherwise lenders would have to hold some portion of the loans on their books . Given new rules recently announced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , industry organizations are lobbying heavily against that minimum down payment . <p> The idea behind the new mortgage regulations are to get lenders to have more skin in the game in order to prevent the reckless lending that brought on the housing crash . This as borrowers are apparently needing less skin in the game now to buy a home .

Harney , LA Times <p> April 10 , 2011 <p> Reporting from Washington <p> You may have seen reports that the federal government is proposing new mortgage finance rules under which only home purchasers who can afford a minimum 20% down payment on a conventional loan would get a shot at the best interest rates and terms . <p> That is correct , and its deeply sobering news for large numbers of first-time and moderate-income buyers who ca n't come up with that much cash or afford to pay higher rates . <p> But some of the other requirements that federal agencies and the Obama administration are proposing in the same plan have gotten much less attention yet could prove just as troublesome for consumers : <p> Strict mandatory debt-to-income limits . Under the proposal , to get the best mortgage rates , you would need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on housing-related expenses , and you could n't have total monthly household debt that exceeds 36% of your income . <p> There would be no flexibility to go beyond these ceilings , unlike in todays marketplace , in which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac consider debt-to-income ratios along with other factors through their electronic underwriting systems . Freddie Mac , for example , has an overall debt-ratio limit of 45% of an applicants stable monthly income . <p> To refinance your existing mortgage and replace it with one carrying the best interest rate , youd need no less than a 25% equity stake in your house to qualify . If you sought to take any additional cash out through a refi , you would need 30% equity . Todays typical requirements for a conventional refi are nowhere near as strict . <p> Pristine credit standards .

The so-called " qualified residential mortgage , " or QRM , proposals were released at the end of March by banking , securities and housing regulators , along with the Department of Housing and Urban Development .

Congress was silent on the subject of minimum down payments . <p> Under the law , loans that do not meet the strict QRM tests will be pushed into a less-favored , higher-cost category : Banks and Wall Street securitizers would need to set aside 5% of loan balances in reserves to cover possible losses from defaults .
