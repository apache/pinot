The trip duration was five days including travel time from Sudbury to Temagami and return . <p> Day One ( Wednesday September 5 ) <p> We left Sudbury at 7:30 am and arrived at the Central Access Road to Temagami Lake about two hours later . The gravel access road was in pretty good shape , with some extended sections of bone-rattling washboard . The access point has several large parking lots and dock / put-in facilities . We were on the water by 10:20 am . <p> Weather was clear , cool and reasonably calm when we put in . Temagami is big , and fairly busy . There are a lot of cottages and lodges ; and motorboat traffic was steady but not heavy . <p> We paddled north between the mainland and Temagami Island . We were intending on paddling along the north side of Bear Island , but were obviously spending more time chatting than navigating and ended up paddling around the south side , a detour that resulted in an extra 2 or 3 km on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up past the west side of Wabun Point . <p> We stopped for lunch on the north end of Long Island , just north of Witch Bay . The campsite there is nice and large . <p> By the time we had finished lunch at 1:30 p.m. , the winds had picked up and were coming in briskly from the southwest . We took the opportunity to hoist a nylon tarp and sailed for the next hour , covering 4 or 5 km . The winds became sporadic at that time , so we dropped the sail and continued north under paddle power . Pushed along by a moderate tailwind , we paddled another 5 or 6 km to Raccoon Point . There are two sites on Raccoon Point , a medium-sized area on the main point ; and a larger site on the tiny point 100m west of that one . We stayed on the second ( larger ) site . It was large and open , in the midst of a stand of red pine . Very beautiful , but quite overused in appearance . <p> We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the day was about 24 km . <p> Day Two ( Thursday September 6 ) <p> We were on the water Thursday at 9:00 a.m . We continued north on the North Arm of Lake Temagami for about 5 km , then turned west and headed through the narrow channel on the south side of Deer Island and Beaver Island . This was a very scenic part of the route , and a welcome change from the big , open water of the previous 6 hours . <p> Sharp Rock Inlet was choppy when we arrived , and we had to deal with a short section of broadside waves as we worked our way across it . The wind and waves settled down somewhat as we turned into the northwestern channel of Sharp Rock Inlet , and within an hour we were at the Sharp Rock Portage . <p> The short 75m portage was not difficult , although footing is a bit rocky ankle twisters all the way . The portage runs parallel to an old wood jackladder , which has now collapsed into a pile of timbers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped for lunch on a small island , which contained a nice campsite . <p> Winds increased as we paddled west through Diamond Lake in the afternoon , and by the time we were approaching the west end of the lake at 2:30 p.m. we were battling a good headwind . <p> We made camp at 3:00 p.m. at a tiny peninsula on the south shore near the end of the lake . The point contained two medium-sized campsites , neither of which were great . We set up tents at the first one , and cooked supper at the better kitchen area on the second one , 25 m away . <p> Weather was still perfect , and we spent the afternoon swimming and relaxing on the smooth rock area adjacent to the first campsite . <p> Day Three ( Friday September 7 ) <p> We were on the water Friday by 9:30 a.m. , but the winds were already pushing the surface of Diamond Lake into whitecaps . We fought our way southwest through a narrow 2.5 km long section of channel -very pretty area with rugged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the first of two portages joining Diamond and Wakimika Lakes . Weve done some tough portages over the years , and we all agreed that this one would rank up there with the best of them . It was n't long ( 430 m ) but it climbed up quite steeply , and the footing in many areas was rocky . It was one of those portages where you cant decide whether to balance on the rocks or to try to stop into the narrow soil area between the rocks . <p> It took 45 sweaty minutes to complete the portage , and we put in on the tiny pond at the end . It was n't worth spending a lot of time packing the gear neatly into canoes , because a 100 m across this pond brought us to the second portage . This carry was almost identical in length ( 435 m ) but very easy . A short carry up a smooth rock face brought us to a flat gravel road bed . We travelled 350 m down this flat gravel road , then cut off to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Wakimika Lake . <p> A narrow ( 200m wide ) channel headed off to the southwest toward Wakimika Lake . Again , we battled a stiff headwind and moderate waves as we worked our way down this channel . <p> We arrived at the narrows at the entrance to Wakimika Lake and were greeted in the sandy shallows by a couple of scruffy , barking dogs . On the western side of the inlet we saw a partially constructed log cabin . The owner of both the dogs and cabin came out to greet us . His name is Stephan , and he indicated that he is a Toronto resident that has apparently decided to get away from it all and homestead in Temagami . His justification for building this cabin in a park area is apparently because he is a friend of Alex Mathias , a long-time resident of the area who has built a cabin on his traditional native trapping grounds on Obabika Lake . He claimed that he had permission from Alex Mathias to construct the cabin on native-owned land . <p> There is currently significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-time resident of this area , and very respected as a source of history , culture and the lands throughout Temagami . Although he certainly would have a firmly entrenched right to build on Obabika Lake by virtue of his family history in these lands , the transferring of this right to a non-native seems to many to be somewhat doubtful . Stephans desire to homestead in this area might be understandable , but it is not clear that he has the right to be hunting , trapping , building or living at this location . <p> Whatever the ultimate outcome in this case , Stephan appeared to us to be somewhat unprepared for the upcoming winter . Although we were visiting in mid-September , the cabin appeared far from completion . The walls and ridgepole were erected , but there was no roof , doors or window in place at the time . There did not appear to be any wood stove , and we could see no firewood stockpiled either . He appeared to be living in a temporary shelter adjacent to the cabin . We chatted briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , winds were blasting in from the south and it took a grueling 45 minutes of hard paddling into whitecaps to paddle the 2 km to the small islands in the centre of the lake . We gratefully paddled into the lee of one of these islands and stopped for lunch . <p> Conditions were no better when we left the island 40 minutes later . We hunched over in the canoes and slogged our way for the next 1.5 km to the south end of Wakimika Lake . The outlet of Wakimika is a grassy , reedy area ( very shallow ) and we had to get out and walk on the sandy bottom to pull our canoes through the shallow water . <p> Wakimika Lake drains into Wakimika Creek , a narrow , winding body of water that heads out from the south end . The creek was extremely shallow , and was almost jungle-like in appearance . Literally hundreds of sweepers and fallen trees have been removed by someone ( God bless em ) with a chainsaw . Without this clearing operation the creek would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ km stretch that had to be pulled over . <p> The creek eventually opens up into a small ( 800 m long ) pond . Even on this tiny body of water , we had to contend with a headwind . Following this pond , another 2 km stretch of creek ( wider than the previous section ) leads to Obabika Lake . <p> We were not planning to venture far down Obabika that afternoon , and as we paddled out into the lake , we knew that our decision was a wise one . Obabika was being blasted by a wind from the south and we looked out on a sea of whitecaps . We picked our way for about 1 km along the western shore and pulled out at the first campsite we could find . <p> The site was on the north side of a point on the west side of the lake and was far from ideal . The only open area was a gravelly beach , but there were three small sites cut into the bush area behind the beach . However , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked just fine to us . <p> We managed to jury-rig a tarp using two trees behind us and a couple of poles tied down to the canoes in the front and settled in for the evening . <p> Day Four ( Saturday September 8 ) <p> Having been witness to the waves and headwinds on Obabika the previous afternoon , we had made the decision to get an early start the next morning . We were up at 6:00 a.m. and after a quick coffee and granola bar , were on the water shortly after 7:00 a.m . Obviously this wasnt early enough , because we were fighting our way into 12 " waves and a strong headwind from the south immediately . <p> Quartering the waves , we paddled southeast down the lake , the canoes bouncing up and slapping down on every third or fourth wave . It took us over an hour to paddle the 4 km down to the lee side of an island on the lake . We paused there to rest our arms and stretch our legs , and entertained our options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , the wind had changed and was coming from the southwest rather than the south , so we could not continue in the same direction without taking the waves broadside . After just fighting our way down the lake to the east side , we were now forced to zig-zag and head over to the west side to make any headway . Another half our of paddling brought us over to the west side , where we experienced some relief from the winds . We rested for 20 minutes and inexplicably , the winds dropped in speed during this time . <p> We quickly scooted over to the east side of the lake to find the portage into Obabika Inlet , and pulled the canoes out on a rocky beach . To say that we were happy to be off this huge body of water would be an understatement . <p> We cleared the gear away from the portage entry and set up the stove to cook a belated breakfast before we attempted the 940 m portage . <p> No portages are fun , but this one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reasonably wide , mainly level and had perfectly flat footing . The trail was entirely packed-down soil with not a rock in sight to twist an ankle . As an added bonus , there were a number of huge old-growth white pines adjacent to the trail . Some of the cut logs that had been cleared from the trail were easily 24 " in diameter . <p> After breakfast was complete , we took less than an hour to haul our gear from one end of the portage to the other . <p> People who have never done wilderness tripping sometimes find it hard to believe that the wind can conspire against paddlers by changing directions ten times a day to deliberately impede progress . I know for a fact that it can happen , because it happened that day . <p> As we headed east along the 7 km length of Obabika Inlet , we were paddling into a headwind all the way . As we turned to the southeast to travel down the Northwest arm of Lake Temagami , we were blasted with a vengeance . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 " waves for about 4 km to the first marked campsite on the east side of the channel . Unfortunately , the site was tiny , not suitable for our group of six . Reluctantly , we put back onto the water and began a 2 km slog to the south to reach the next site on Sand Point . <p> Sand Point was a small , grassy field out on a point . It was very exposed to the winds , but with the only alternative being more paddling , we thought it looked just fine . We struggled to set up the tents in windy conditions around the perimeter of the site . A path behind the site led back to a small clearing with no less than five thunderboxes , all of them in quite disgusting condition . <p> Winds remained brisk throughout the entire evening , and we could see flashes of lightning in the south . We were spattered several times by drops of rain , but we never got dumped on . We had our traditional sauna that night , in our customised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat long enough for two good sweats and jumps into the cold lake . <p> Only an 11 km paddle out the next morning , so we would n't have to get up too early . <p> Day Five ( Sunday September 9 ) <p> Up at 7:30 and after a lazy breakfast and several coffees , we hit the water at 9:00 a.m . Paddled under gray , misty skies that dropped a bit of fine rain on us . Thankfully the water was dead flat and we enjoyed one of our first easy paddles of the trip . <p> Skies began to clear during the morning , and we were back at the Temagami main access area by 10:45 a.m. 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @qwx994055 <p> An interesting stop on this route is Cliff Lake , just a short hike from the large campsite on then northeast corner of Lake Obabika .

Everyone was immediately overwhelmed by the serene tranquility of the lake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative details concerning our first evening and our transport to Cartier train station the next morning . After an enjoyable dinner we all called it an early night to be fresh and spry for our adventure awaiting us . <p> Day 1 We arrived at the train station at 0945 hrs and systematically arranged our gear and canoes for the pick-up . We anxiously awaited the arrival of the " Budcar " which arrived fashionably late at 1040 hrs ( 40 minutes late ) . <p> Space was tight due to a last minute booking by a group going to their cottage with a 14 ft fishing boat but after 25 min all was loaded and we were on our way . The trip was scenic and the weather was a carbon copy of the previous day . Our first view of the Spanish River revealed extremely low water conditions and we all wondered if we would be doing more walking than canoeing . 45 minutes later we arrived at the " Forks " . Along with the cottagers we unloaded with no problems . A few steps to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riverbank . We were relieved to see that here the water levels were fairly high . Within 20 minutes we were on our way wondering what everyone else was doing at work . <p> After 30 minutes on the river we stopped for lunch on the island at the actual fork in the river . ( GR 352093 ) . We were back on the water by 1300 hrs and so far the bugs were not too bad . After 1 hour we came to the first marked portage ( actually the only sign we ever saw ) at GR 378064 . The water was low enough here that a portage was not required . I decided to take a look at the portage for future trips and discovered a beautiful camp sight half way through the portage . Since our trip was only going to be 45 km over 3 days we decided to enjoy the rest of our first day at this camp site . I decided to spend an hour fly fishing while others read , walked or just relaxed . No luck ( probably because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Normally , I am told the trout are abundant in the Spanish . <p> Unfortunately due to a fire ban we were unable to enjoy a nice campfire . The bugs were still very manageable and disappeared around 2000 hrs when it became a little cooler . We all went to bed at 1000 hrs . <p> Day 2 <p> Rise and shine at 0730 hrs to a crisp clear sunny morning . By 1000 hrs we hit the water . Water levels varied but we were always able to pick good routes through the rapids with minimal rock contact . An ABS canoe is definitely recommended for these types of water levels . At noon we found a nice sand bar an enjoyed a nice lunch with temperatures around 27 degrees . We stopped at the Pogamasing river junction just after lunch and viewed the chute apparently used by loggers for a long time . We noticed some cloud development just after lunch and realized we would soon be wet campers . Mother Nature was gentle bringing only 30 minutes of rain . Unfortunately it happened right when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( GR 419915 ) . We pushed on for about an other 1.5 hrs ( we missed 3 of the 4 site marked closely together on the MNR map ) and ended up at a great spot below a high ridge ( GR 436853 ) . This one was not marked the map but was marked by a sign . We settled in and about 6 of our group did some rappelling and top roping just north of our site on the east shore . Although we had some rain we still did not take a chance building a fire even tough we were tempted . Still no fish . <p> Day 3 The day dawned with clear skies and still conditions . We packed up and were on our way by 0930 hrs . The winds started picking up and we soon started bucking a strong headwind , however the stronger currents at this part of the river helped us maintain a speed of around 5 km/hr . The river was quite shallow from here to Spanish Lake with lots of class I rapids ( some bordering on class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a very challenging stretch of water . The campsite marked on the MNR map at GR 449800 is co-located with a cottage . Spanish Lake was pretty and due to heavy winds , very choppy . We planned to stay overnight at the campsite marked on the MNR map at GR 454668 but never did find it . The river has high banks from the Spanish River to the " Elbow " . We ended up at the " Elbow " at 1400 Hrs . We surveyed the campsite here , a large open field , and decided we would rather head back to the lodge and spend our last night there . <p> Conclusion Although the river level was low and a fire ban was in effect we all learned a great deal and enjoyed ourselves . The MNR map was not very helpful , however while we were at the lodge we found out that volunteers are signing the river in detail over the next few months and a new map should be published soon with greater detail .

A relatively short low arctic trip with amazing scenery , runnable drops , lots of animals , and the possibility of canoeing into a town with scheduled air service , all only 1000 miles north of Montreal . The only problem is getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaf Bay . <p> To simplify the logistics and save money , we used PakCanoes ( built in Enfield , NH ) which we brought along as luggage ( Free ! ) on the First Air flight from Montreal to Kuujjuaq . We took Johnny May 's float plane charter to our put in on the Charpentier River , which drains into Lac Minto . Our biggest problem with the trip was missing our flight from Montreal and being wind/cloud bound in Kuujjuaq for two additional days . This resulted in lengthening our charter flight ( 200 miles ) and reducing the amount of time we had for side trips and on the Charpentier . Our original plan had been to fly to Lac Nedluac , but it would also be possible to fly directly to the Leaf or Lac Minto . <p> 8/16 We put in at Lake 217 , on a small island just below a sizable drop .

We struggled with a headwind in the morning , but it had switched by the afternoon . Minto is exquisite with large barren hills and numerous caribou trails . We camped at the foot of one of these trails and were greeted by 12 caribou crossing north from our camp site just after breaking camp . We also saw the first northern lights and first black fly from this camp site just uplake from R. Irsuaq . <p> 8/19 We reached the exit rapids in 4 miles .

Only saw one caribou all day , but rapids picked up after a stop at former Hydro Quebec camp . ( This is a possible put in , it 's only 160 miles to Kuujjuaq ) The rapids are a mixture of R-1 's and scout from the boat R-2 's . There are many miles of continuous runnable boulder garden style rapids . <p> 8/21 More rain . Excellent breakfast and late start with worsening conditions in the afternoon . Lunch at 4:00 using emergency shelter to keep warm . Big tail winds and 2-3 ft waves . Sailed again . Used emergency shelter to cook dinner because we were all very wet and cold .

Northern lights at camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check tide schedule . Out at 7:45 in order to make high tide at the exit rapids at 12:00 . No luck . First head wind since Minto . The river has lots of sand bars now and we met people for the first time . Two Quebecois caribou hunters setting up a fly-in camp and a freighter canoe with 3 Inuit hunters from Tasiujaq . They said they would give us a ride into town at noon the next day so we stopped at the exit rapids and made camp ( 4 pm ) . This is a beautiful spot , with seals , an owl , and a small black bear all seen from the camp site . The sand/boulder bar we are camped on is not a possible portage although it may be possible to line the drop at low tide . At high tide this is not necessary , because the entire 40 vertical feet of the drop is under water ! ! We arrived at the highest tides in the month at the spot with the highest tides in the world . Amazing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus sized boulders that are dry at low tide . <p> 8/25 Great weather with scattered clouds and no wind . We used the morning to dry clothes and wait for Inuit hunters to return . When the rapids disappeared at 11:30 we ferried all our gear and boats below the ' drop ' where we expected to get our ride . At 2:30 the rapids had started to reemerge so we began our 20 mile ocean paddle into town . This late start was a real error which forced us into our first real portage on the Leaf , a twenty foot lift over in the middle of the ocean around the first part of tidal rapids that appeared during tide change ( 3:00 ) in the exit fjord . <p> This was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen canoeing . We were paddling on a calm sea between incredible cliffs/small mountains when a line appeared 100 yards ahead of us . This line turned into a huge rapids ! We eddied out on sea right behind a 10 foot boulder that just appeared out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( may be bigger in the middle ) rapids all the way across the mile wide fjord . We portaged the first part of the drop on the former ocean floor ( very slippery ) and then ran the retreating water out through an enormous boulder field till we reached the new sea level 20 vertical feet below . Ten minutes earlier the drops might have been too big , and five minutes later it would have been dry and we would have been trapped for 6 hours . This tidal rapids was not mentioned on either of the trip reports we had , and probably could have been avoided entirely if we had left the exit rapids at high tide . <p> We had escaped and were back on Leaf Bay with an incredible adrenaline rush . We paddled across the front of Baie Rouge ( now all rocks ) to Pointe de la Riviere . The sea was beautiful with birds and an occasional seal . Unfortunately , low tide forced us to go the long way around because all the islands were connected to the mainland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Baie Profund with the tide working for us now . We saw another incredible rainbow and stopped for a 10 minute lunch at 7:30 on Isle de Rowe only 4 miles from town . Just before the Finger River mouth a beluga whale surfaced twice next to the boats . We could see the lights of the town , but the river had a series of rapids that we had to line/pull up as it got dark . Finally , we stopped trying to follow the river and carried our packs into town across the sand bars , only to find that the river had come up so quickly that the boats could now float in 1-2 feet of water where we had just walked 10 minutes earlier . The rapids had vanished entirely . If we had waited 30 minutes we could have paddled into town instead of dragging up the river . To make it more bizarre , we arrived at the town dock at the same time as the Inuit hunters , who had killed 11 caribou and propped a head on their prow . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hotel , but it does have an indoor hockey rink and an airport with a tower , waiting area and baggage claim . We camped on the main street by the town dock and were quickly visited by several groups of people driving by . We called home and in the morning met Mario the city administrator and Anthony the Northern Store manager ( and wilderness paddler from Ontario ) . Our flight out was at 2:30 , but first Mario drove us 1 mile out of town towards a small circle of musk oxen that had been approached by several of the town 's dogs . An amazing end to an amazing trip . Musk oxen in the a.m. , Montreal in the p.m . <p> PakCanoes made the logistics easy , but a few more days , or a take-out by freighter canoe from Kuujjuaq or Tasiujaq would have allowed for side trips and fishing .

There are two other campgrounds located on the lake , with the first being situated about 2 1/4 miles down the lake on the eastern shore . This site is frequently used by tourists and one should not count on it being vacant at all times . The last site is situated at the south end of the lake which marks the start of the portage to Edna Lake . <p> Portage - into Edna Lake is necessary due to the large build-up of logs and driftwood at the mouth of the river .

A beaver dam situated approximately one mile from Graveyard makes a liftover necessary into another stretch of fast water . A mile farther down river , there is a mile long stretch of fast , shallow water which can be paddled at times , but for the most part must be waded . Situated midway on this fast water are high granite cliffs towering 200 feet above the narrow waterway . Vegetation consists mainly of cedar with the odd pine present . <p> Proudfoot Lake - offers the canoeist a chance to paddle again , since it is a widening of the river ( approximately l 1/2 miles long ) .

Unlike the neighbouring Snake and Bonnet Plume rivers , the current on the Wind actually increases after it leaves the mountains and enters the Peel plateau . The Wind River also passes a couple of isolated mountains as it works its way towards the Peel River . <p> We had planned to spend our last off day doing a day hike up Mount Deception . This meant an 80 km day which we covered in about 8 or 9 hours . The river was moving quite quickly and was very braided , making it difficult to find the best channel at times . We passed the confluence with the Little Wind River - looked like a nice area to camp . In Ken Madsens " Paddling in the Yukon " two rapids between the Little Wind River and Mount Deception are noted . We did n't  notice anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might change things . The constant braiding and cutting of new channels in this section of river also means that the river can change from year to year , and even from month to month . We did n't  pass through anything that I would regard as more difficult than straightforward class II . The wide open braided nature of the river also means that it is quite easy to spot whitewater well ahead and avoid it by lining or wading your canoes past the more difficult section . Keep your eyes ahead to pick the best channel and watch for hazards . <p> As we approached Mount Deception we had been warned to stay river left . The river splits into two main channels about 500 metres before it goes past the mountain , and you must stay left if you want to stop and hike . We camped at a mediocre , rocky site on river left just past the mountain . The next day we enjoyed a great hike up Mount Deception . After 10 minutes of bushwhacking you are into an open , old burn area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of ridge hiking available here , and the views across the flat Peel plateau extend to the Bonnet Plume and Peel Rivers if the sky is clear . The Wind ends about another 35 kms north as it joins with the Peel River . Beautiful orange and yellow bluffs on river right signal the entrance to a small canyon that opens up again as you hit the Peel . We camped here and enjoyed the sun setting on the colorful sand formations . <p> We floated through the canyon into the Peel the next day , and paddled past the confluence with the Bonnet Plume to the Peel canyon . The canyon contains the last rapids of any consequence on the trip . At the lower water levels of our late August trip there were 3-4 foot standing waves on river left in a couple of spots that were easily avoided by staying right . Apparently these standing waves are higher and extend further across the river at higher water levels . I suspect that river right would still be the safest route , and there is nothing other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is impressive and there are a couple of gravel bars on river right inside the canyon that allow you to pull off the river and enjoy the scenery . <p> The farther you paddle on the Peel the less interesting it gets . The current gradually slows until it is almost nonexistent by the time it reaches Fort McPherson . There are lots of high sand bluffs as you continue past the Snake River , but the topography flattens out more and more . The camping also gets poorer the closer you get to McPherson . <p> We were short of time on this trip , so we had arranged for a boat shuttle from the Caribou River to McPherson . From the Peel canyon , we paddled two long days to cover the 180 kms . We rafted up for lunches and finished the second day camped on a gravel bar very close to the Arctic Circle . We celebrated with a quick dip in the river , and spent our last night watching a black bear foraging on the opposite bank for a couple of hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach Fort McPherson . We saved at least 2 long days paddling allowing us to spend 2 extra days hiking in the mountains . From a previous trip down the Snake River , I can tell you that the last 2 days to McPherson are long , slow and boring . Passing even a poor camp site in this section of river can result in a couple of hours until the next poor campsite . <p> We split up in McPherson 3 of us had arranged for a friend from Whitehorse to pick them up , while 2 of us got a ride up to Inuvik and caught an Air North flight home . Overall it was a great trip . The only complaint I have is the weather . As you can see from the pictures , we had rain most days . Maybe this was because of the late August date that we left , or perhaps we just had bad luck . I look forward to another trip on the Wind and better weather .

This was only the third attempt since the 1920s or 1930s to travel the full length of the Trail and would be the first in that time to be done without the assistance of motor vehicles on the portage routes . Many of the carries were unmarked , unmapped , and unknown . The only existing maps of the Trail 's portage routes were sketches published by WF Ganong in 1899 . <p> The Members of the Crossing Party . The members of the crossing were : Mike Grant of Fredericton NB ; Matt Hopkinson of Hubbardston MA , USA ; Beth Johnston of Fredericton NB ; Dino KubiK of Fredericton NB ; Craig Macdonald of Dwight ON ; Nancy Macdonald of Fredericton NB ; Paul Meyer of Fredericton NB ; and last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NB . <p> The Objective The goal of the crossing was to experience the Ancient Maliseet Trail and to leave a digital record of what we would find so as to encourage future use of the Trail . We agreed that we would set aside 9 days to do the crossing and our intent was to go all the way to Old Town ME but making it to the Penobscot River as an acceptable achievement . No cars were used once we started and we tried to use the actual portage routes where possible . Three of the canoes were moved over the 15-17 kilometres of portage routes using " portage carts " while the canoe and packs of Paul Meyer and Beth Johnston were carried in the traditional manner . This allowed Beth and Paul to stay closest to what we considered the original portage trails . <p> Day 0 : Evening of Friday , May 20 , 2005 Camping in Hay Settlement , NB The crossing party gathered at the Provincial hiking trail called the Maliseet Trail on Route 165 ( Old TCH ) just south of Woodstock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance and camped for the evening . Day 1 : Saturday , May 21 , 2005 The Benton Portage and on to Molly 's Rock on the Eel River . Distance : Portage 5-7 kms Paddle 5kms We walked west to the Saint John River to get a start as close to the site of Ancient Fort Meductic as the now-flooded Meductic flats would allow . At 9:30 am , after a group photo , we turned west to retract our steps to the previous night 's camp and then onto Benton and the Eel River . Before departing the encampment , we left a Cuban Cohiba cigar . This act would be repeated until the Cohibas were gone . We walked the hiking trail until it crossed under the new Trans Canada Highway and faded out . When the footpath disappeared , we followed a compass bearing trail towards Benton . Sometime after 2:00pm we exited the woods , walked the last 2-3 kilometres on the road and arrived at the Eel River around 3pm . We gathered our boats , gear , and departed from the Ducks Unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 km paddle up the Eel River . Molly 's Rock came into view around 4:30pm and went ashore for the night . The site offered limited space for camping but it was early in the season so there was enough standing dead wood to supply a fire . Day 2 : Sunday , May 22 , 2005 Molly 's Rock to a point above Stafford 's Mills . Paddle 10 kms ( estimated ) We were quickly on the water about 8 am and just as quickly the lead boats found themselves in a dead-end bog and unable to discern the channel . Flood conditions made the Eel 's appearance confusing . The River narrowed , the current gathered strength and our first set of rapids were at a short pinch in the River where eddies near the shore eased our passing up River . The next serious challenge was at Slater 's Rips where concerted efforts were requited to move boats through a distinct transition zone under the bridge . Boats began poling and lining to deal with the challenges and we continuing on towards Stafford Mills through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Mills Bridge a little after 1 pm and portaged around the next section of the River as the topo indicated an end to the rips within a kilometre . At 5:30 pm we made camp a short distance above Stafford 's Mills . Day 3 : Monday , May 23 , 2005 Above Stafford 's Mills on the Eel to North Lake . Portage : 6-7 kms &amp; Paddle 12 kms <p> After breakfast , Craig cut a 100 metre portage to advance the boats and gear . From this put in it was again necessary to pole the boats . We would encounter three sections requiring poling before arriving at the remains of the earthen dam at Watson 's Mill and two sections after Watson 's . Big swampy dead waters marked the end of the difficulties ascending the 24 kilometres of the Eel River . We entered the widening sections of the River with a stiffening North East wind at our backs . We arrived at Bear Trap Point a little after noon and stopped for lunch before entering First Eel River Lake . The Lake would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of being a safety consideration . The Lake crossing began a little after 1pm , and with a stop for water from a local well we arrived at the other end of the Lake around 2:30 pm . We took the occasion to check out some new information on the ancient portage trail and were on or way to North Lake by 3:30 . We arrived at our North Lake camping site by 6pm . <p> Day 4 : Tuesday , May 24 , 2005 North Lake to Cleave 's Landing on the Baskaheagan Stream . Portage 5-7 Kms Paddle 25 kms A strong North East wind continued as we crossed south over 5 kilometres of a choppy North Lake to arrive at the Canada Custom 's Landing by 10:30 . A visit to US immigration and then it was 1 km down the Thoroughfare and south onto 20 kilometres of a white capped and choppy Grand Lake . We arrived at Davenport Cove by 4:30pm with stops at Spruce Point and Norway Point . Three of the boats were loaded on carts and Paul and Beth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5pm . The cart pullers deviated from the Baskaheagan Trail to arrive at Cleaves Landing on the Baskaheagan by 7:30 pm .

Paddle 25-35 kms Portage 1-2 kms ( plus groceries ) That morning , Matt , Mike , and Craig took a canoe on a cart and walked the 3 miles into Danforth to do some grocery shopping . It took the boys and hour to walk a cart into town and , once the shopping was done , the paddle home on the Baskaheagan was only 30 minutes . By 11:30 the shopping was done and we started on the Baskaheagan by 11:30am . We arrived at Bean Falls around 2pm , portaged around Bean Falls , and were back on the Baskaheagan by 3:30pm . Soon we were on the Mattawamkeag River and by 5pm we were in camp . <p> Day 6 : Thursday , May 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paddle 25-30 kms The rains were constant and the temperatures were the coolest of the trip . The paddle through the dead water below Wytopitlock was particularly cold and wet but that continuing North East wind balanced the weather out to be a net gain . The Mattawamkeag Wilderness Park came into sight around 4pm and was repreve with its Adirondack shelters , stacked firewood , and absence of other campers . <p> Day 7 : Friday , May 27 , 2005 Mattawamkeag Wilderness Park to Penobscot River North Lincoln . Paddle 30 kms Portage 2-3kms We ran the canoes through a short section of the white water leading into the Park then around 10:30 the portage to Lower Gordon started . Three canoes were again put on portage carts and tracked over the Park 's roads to Lower Gordon while Paul and Beth paddled out of camp towards a real-deal portage journey along the trail following the River . All four boats arrived at the top of Lower Gordon Falls about 11:30am . We reached the Penobscot River early in the afternoon and made our encampment above Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Penobscot and another 14 on the Mattawamkeag . <p> Day 8 : Saturday , May 28 , 2005 Penobscot River : North Lincoln to below Passadumkeag River Paddle 40 kms Portage 1kms We were up and on the River by 9am then stopped to refill our water supply at Lincoln since we stopped drinking treated River Water after North Lake . We paddle all day in misty to rainy conditions making it eighth straight day of paddling in rain gear . <p> At Howland we portaged around the hydro dam at River-right and were back on the River by 2:30 . The weather began to clear and about 5 pm we camped 20 to 25 kilometres above Old Town . This was to be the first encampment where we would enjoy a visible sunset in nine nights . <p> Day 9 : Sunday , May 29 , 2005 Penobscot River : Below Passadumkeag River to Old Town . Paddle 25 kms This day dawned on a changed weather system and the last breakfast of the crossing was under a sunny sky . We hit the River a little before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We made a number of stops and rafted together in the sunny conditions . As the morning progressed , the rain returned .

Shortly before noon , Matt and Tony were the first of our party to arrive at Old Town landing and were ready with the cameras to capture the landing of the remaining three boats . There were no shortage of smiles as we posed for pictures to mark the conclusion of a crossing without incident , argument , or accident . We walked to the Old Town Canoe Factory to wait for our shuttle home . There we looked at the canoes and watched a great video on the history of the company . Our shuttle driver , Tom Somerville , arrived at 5 pm and when we returned to the landing we had a chance to met Timothy Gould , a warden of the Penobscot Nation .

Allow at least 4.5 hours to get to the outfitter from Baie Comeau . An alternate launch point exists at km 288 at a small landing at the SE end of the lake . <p> The drive up to Lac Manicouagan is possible in any sedan in summer . We made it in a Chevy Cobalt with a canoe strapped on the roof with foam blocks . A spare tire , and extra fluids ( coolant , oil , wiper ) is recommended . Gas is available every 100km or so , but a jerry can in the trunk is not a bad idea . <p> We used the directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They proved accurate and useful . Basic French skills are an asset on the drive up , since a minority of people speak any workable English up here . Patience , gestures , and kindness can work in lieu of French skills . <p> Access to the Lake : <p> The people at Poirvoire du Prospecteur ( 1-600-701-0264 ) were very helpful , though they speak little if any English . Parking plus launching at the outfitter is a $25 fee with the security that your car is safe for the trip from bears and unkind people . Included in the fee is the option to camp one night at the outfitters post . As far as we could tell , they do n't  offer any canoe trip outfitting services . The woman at the outfitters recommends a satellite phone , since the lake can whip up storms " comme une mer " ( " like an ocean " ) . The woman also commented that the lakes surroundings are " heavenly " . <p> On the Water : <p> The winds shift often on this massive lake . Light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) can whip up long , rolling swells up to 1m high . A canoe with plenty of freeboard and rocker is helpful to keep out the water . Knowledge of wind ferries is very useful when making crossings at angle to the wind . Otherwise , it is a big , beautiful stretch of water . If the weather is foul and a headwind whips up , wait an hour or two and the winds will surely shift . <p> Camping : <p> As of July 2006 , the water level in the Lac Manicouagan Reservoir was about 5m below the maximum water level , as indicated by the lack of mature trees . 10-15 year old trees extended to approximately 2m above the water line , leaving plenty of unvegetated area to set up camp . Abundant driftwood is available all along the shores of the lake . <p> Camping on small islands in the lake is best to avoid blackflies , bears , and other critters at night . <p> There are plenty of sandy coves to camp on . A Google Earth image of the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as opposed to the darker treed areas inland . Camping in the forest is unadvisable in my opinion , due to the risk of Black Spruce falling over in windstorms , and the thick , soft , and often wet carpet of mosses underneath . Obviously , the strictest no-trace camping should be practiced here , since vegetation is slow to grow back that far north . <p> With such a massive reservoir , rapid changes in water level seem unlikely , though placing the canoe and tent a healthy distance from shore overnight is advisable at least because of large waves . <p> Geology and Boreal Forest Ecology : <p> **As an environmental science student , I felt this section was necessary** <p> Lake Manicouagan is a 214 million year old complex impact structure .

Trees are primarily black spruce , with sparse birch , stunted willow bushes and less common jack pine , red spruce , and tamarack . A thick cover of forest mosses and patches of peat mosses make up the understory , along with Labrador tea , blueberry , and numerous other shrubs . 134054 @qwx994054 <p> Trip Log : <p> Preamble : <p> I spent the summer of 2006 working on restoring a harvest peatland outside of Riviere du Loup , QC . Working overtime on evenings and weekends , I made up enough time to take a week off . After a trip to Temagami was cancelled at the last minute , me and a co-worker of mine ( Nathalie Brunet ) from the University of Waterloo decided with only a weeks notice to make a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Quebec . We rented the only canoe available in town ( a flat bottomed , shallow 15.5 footer ) and strapped it to the sedan , with only printed out digital topo maps and Google earth images to guide us . Since we had only two people in one less than optimal canoe , we played the trip safe , and stuck close to the outfitters , and preferred not to venture too far into the big waters . <p> Day One July 8 2006 <p> Left St. Arsene , QC at 8am to catch the 11am ferry from Matane to Godbout . Later on found out the Rimouski-Forestville ferry is much faster . Got last supplies ( Tim Hortons ) in Baie Comeau and started on the 389 at 3:30pm . Arrived at Pourvoire du Prospecteur at 7:30pm . Paddled out to a small sand spit to set up camp 3km to the SW just before sunset . <p> Day Two July 9 <p> Woke up at 7:30 to a quick breakfast and were on the water by 8:30 . Our goal was to complete the largest open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A light wind ( 10-15km/h ) from the south whipped up large gently rolling waves up to 1m high . Since there were no white caps and the waves were very long , the crossing was slow but safe and successful . <p> After the largest crossing , a strong SW wind picked up along with showers and dark clouds . We picked the closest sandy cove and set up camp , waiting out the wind before deciding to stay there for the day . The sheltered location , plentiful dry driftwood , view east onto the Groulx Mountains , and fine sandy beach made it nearly the perfect campsite . <p> Day Three July 10 <p> We decided to break camp and paddle west to a small inlet leading to a fair sized lake within Ile de Rene Levasseur at 51.46N 68.43W . We saw a beaver amongst the thick grasses that grow along the shores of the inlets . These inlets are sheltered from the scouring of the shifting spring ice pack . <p> Initially , we hiked along the small stream draining the lake , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream . Trekking inland , we found a lightly used trail leading towards the lake from a small hunting cabin on the inlet . While the view of this smaller lake-within-a-lake was great , the hike through the boreal forest was mystical . Afterwards , we paddled another 8km north to a campsite on a sandy spit on a small island . <p> Day Four July 11 <p> We decided to paddle north and explore the NE corner of the lake on our final day on the water . We did n't  want to travel too far away from our open water crossing in case the wind picked up . We had lunch , swam , and waited out the mid-afternoon winds at a gravel beach at 51.58N 68.42W with a wonderful of the lake and mountains . The water was very cold . Luckily , by 3pm or so , the winds slowed and shifted to a W direction , giving us an ideal tailwind for a 4km crossing to the main shore .

We cooked a slow tasty dinner as the sun set over the islands of Lac Manicouagan . <p> Day Five July 12 <p> We packed up and broke camp early and enjoyed a tailwind as we travelled the few kms SE back to la Pourvoire du Prospecteur for lunch . Not as rushed to as on the way up , we stopped to take photographs alongside the 51Fme parallOle sign and the Manic V dam . We enjoyed the drive back to St. Arsene , arriving at Midnight .

We paddled the Mattawa from the west end of Trout Lake in north Bay to the junction of the Mattawa and Ottawa Rivers , at the town of Mattawa <p> Water levels were extremely low - apparently the lowest they had been in about 20 years . Paddlers on the trip were Richard Munn , Rob Crema , Peter Shuparski , Alan Marcon , Niel McKay and Gil Gasparini . <p> Day One ( 18 km / no portages or rapids ) <p> We met at Tim Hortons east of Sudbury at 7:30 am and headed out for North Bay . We had three vehicles carrying three canoes . The shuttle plan was for all three drivers to meet at the MNR office at Trout Lake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of us would stay there to organize and pack the canoes . The other three people would take the three vehicles up to Mattawa , and return to North Bay in one of the cars . We would leave behind a truck and a van , so that we could bring the three canoes ( two in the back of the truck ) back to North Bay at the completion of the trip . <p> Arrived at the MNR office in North Bay at about 9:00 am and unloaded the gear . The shuttle drivers were back from Mattawa by about 11:00 and we headed east on Trout Lake . <p> Trout Lake is a large body of water , with many cottages along its shores . We paddled under sunny skies in fairly calm conditions . There was a bit of a west wind , so we decided to tie the canoes together and hoist a nylon tarp as a sail . Unfortunately , the winds were sporadic , and we spend more time uncovering our bow paddlers from the collapsed sail than we did sailing . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twice more , the winds seem to pick up and we again attempted to sail , with similar results . Even when we were catching a good breeze , the GPS showed that we were progressing at between 4 and 5 km / hr , less than our normal paddling speed . We finally packed away the tarp and simply paddled the rest of the lake . <p> Stopped for lunch at one of the sites at the east end of Camp Island ( UTM 328304 ) for lunch . The site was gorgeous , with large tent areas and a nice sand beach . Unfortunately it was also heavily overused and littered with trash . A 6 " diameter maple had been chopped down with an axe and abandoned . It lay there still attached to the stump , with the branches and leaves still on it . Apparently somebody ( not understanding that green wood does n't  burn ) had tried to make it into firewood and given up in the process . The beach and firepit were littered with bottles , cans and paper . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site , taking with us a half-filled green garbage bag . There are several sites on the east end of Trout Lake in addition to the one that we stopped at . The two points that protruded from the east end both have large camping areas . My guess from the degree of soil compaction and amount of litter is that they are heavily used not only by paddlers , but by local boaters as a camping / picnic area . <p> About 1 km west of Camp Island , the lake begins to narrow down and empties into the Mattawa River . A short distance down the river , we passed the Stepping Stones , a narrow rock garden which partially crosses the river . This boulder pile is the remnants of a glacial moraine which crossed the river at one time . Close to this location , there is a public park / picnic area on the south side of the river .

This historic portage is no longer necessary since the rapid here was blasted out to allow boat traffic between Trout Lake and Turtle Lake . The river takes a sharp left at this location , going through a pretty narrows at the former rapid location . A scenic 4 km section of river followed . There were several campsites visible on small Islands along this stretch ( for example , on Stubbs Island ) but the ones we inspected were very small . They tended to have nice firepit / sitting areas , but limited space for tents . They seemed to be more lunch-stops than actual campsites . We decided to paddle another 3 km or so into Turtle Lake , which had several promising-looking points on the north shore for camping . We were not disappointed .

It could easily hold 7 or 8 tents if necessary . It was quite clean , looking as if it had just been tidied up and raked , but there were a lot of areas with Trillium Patches of toilet paper in various locations . We unloaded and were finished setting up the tents and kitchen area by 5:00 pm . Great supper of Parmesan noodles and chicken , and we relaxed and watched the sunset from the rocks . It was dark by 8:30 pm , and when the last remnants of light had disappeared from the horizon , we went back down to the rocks to stargaze . We spent and hour or so staring at a wonderful display of stars , satellites and meteorites . We were treated to the most spectacular shooting star that any of us have ever witnessed . It streaked across the sky , with an amazingly bright tail that had a greenish tinge and a length that spanned a quarter of the distance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything like it before . <p> Everyone turned in at about 10:30 pm ( are we getting old , or what ! ) <p> Day Two ( 10 km / 2 Portages or rapids ) <p> The relaxed pace of the trip ( 60 km in 4 days ) meant that we did n't  have to be overly ambitious . We were up at 8:00 am , and spent a lazy hour or so drinking coffee and eating breakfast . Packed up camp and were on the water at about 10:00 am . <p> We were planning to paddle about 15 km and portage around the Talon Dam at the end of the day . Less than 1 km down Turtle Lake , we arrived at Portage de la Mauvaise Musique . Well , we almost arrived at it . What we actually arrived at was a very shallow swampy area in the river which lead into the portage . We paddled and poled our way through the weedy section until we reached a small beaver dam . After pulling over the dam , we found ourselves in an even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grunted our way through about 100 m of very soft riverbed with hummocks of grass at the sides . The bottom was oozy black loon shit with a high content of swamp gas - lots of fun . We managed to get the canoes to the beginning of the portage without unloading any of the gear , which was a bit of a plus . <p> The actual portage from this point was short and well-groomed . It is marked as 200 paces . It is level for most of its length , with one small hill near the end . The end of the trail is on Pine Lake . Pine Lake is about 2 km long , and very pretty . Lots of small pine-covered islands , and a few cottages along the north side of the lake . We saw campsites on many of these islands , but did n't  stop to check all of them . Those that we could see from the water seemed to be quite small . <p> Portage Pin de Musique leaves Pine Lake on the north shore . Marked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were paved . It is wide , groomed and level . About 50 m along the trail it crosses a gravel road , the carries on towards Talon Lake . The last 100 m or so is a moderately steep downhill . It ends at a sandy beach on Talon Lake . Talon is a large lake ( almost as large as Trout Lake ) but most of the cottages are clustered along the northwest shoreline . It feels a little more isolated that it actually is , but we were also there in mid-September and it would probably be much busier with boat traffic in mid-summer . We paddled north then southeast on calm water under sunny skies , and stopped for lunch at Graswell Point . The site on the point is excellent , with a couple of white sand beaches , and a level grass field behind the trees . The firepit was clean , as was the entire site . A couple of box latrines sit behind the site . The excellent quality of the site , and our easy paddling itinerary made us start considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After much debate , we decided to stay put for the day - an embarrassingly short 10 km day . <p> We ate lunch and set up the tents , and were in relax mode by 1:30 pm . Played euchre , enjoyed the scenery and swam ( chilly water ) off the white sandy beaches . A family with four small children stopped at the site on a pontoon boat and stayed for a couple of hours , swimming at one of the beaches . We got the impression that the site was used not only as a canoeing campsite , but also as a small recreational park by the locals . In any event , we did n't  mind sharing the beach on such a beautiful day . <p> After supper , we began to get ready for our annual " sweat-lodge . " This is n't a real sweat lodge in the sense of that used by native cultures , but the concept is the same . Our sweat lodge consists of one of those horrible floppy six-person K Mart tents that you can buy on sale for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cut out the floor and sewed the tent fly on the top over the mesh vent area . We heat up 7 or 8 large rocks ( red hot ) in the fire , put them in a pile and place the tent over them . We then pile in around the perimeter and enjoy this portable sauna . <p> A couple of caveats ... wood has to be gathered from far and wide so as not to strip the area around the campsite completely bare . We send out a couple of canoes to gather wood from a wide area . Second , the whole concept can be potentially dangerous . It does n't  take much of an imagination to envision the injury that would result if someone lost their balance and fell onto or stepped on the hot rocks . Third , you have to be willing to do a bit of work to restore the site . For example , we built the fire in the existing firepit and used the rocks from a second firepit on the site . When all was said and done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourth , you cant do this on a patch of grass and expect no damage - it should be done on bare rock or sand . <p> Our sweat was ready by 10:00 pm and we entered the tent , lit by a candle lantern . Half an hour later , having been blasted awake by three or four trips between the scorching steam and the cold lake , we flopped exhausted onto the ground to recover . Lightning was beginning to light up the sky in the distance , and we could hear distant thunder . It sounded like it was bypassing us , and we finally turned in at about midnight . As it turned out , the storm did n't  miss us ... at about 2:00 in the morning we were treated to a loud thunderstorm right over us , and some heavy rains for about an hour and a half . <p> Day Three ( 14 km / 6 portages or rapids ) Woke up to a cool , overcast day with a bit of chop on the lake . Everyone was up by 8:00 am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paddled the remaining 5 km down Talon Lake in a cold north wind . By the time we reached the end of the lake , the cloud cover was beginning to break and we could see blue skies once again . Just west of Talon Lake is the Talon Dam and a 330 pace portage . Definitely an ankle-breaker . The trail winds up and down over very rugged rock outcrops , then drops very steeply through a mini-canyon to end at a rocky put-in . It is hard enough to keep ones footing going from west to east , as we were . It would be a good climb up very uneven ground to do in the other direction . Rating ... somewhere between moderate and difficult in the direction we did it . Nonetheless , it is a truly beautiful trail , with wonderful rock formations . A climb to the top of the outcrops gives a great view of the river from the top of the cliffs . There are several swirl holes in the rock at the top of the cliffs , caused by the rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedrock as the water flowed over it when levels were much , much higher . The holes are perfectly circular in cross-section , looking like they have been mechanically bored , and some of them are 5-6 ft. deep . Unfortunately , the bottom of the holes is littered with beer cans and food wrappers ... got ta wonder who would do something like that . <p> A quick paddle to the east brought us to Pimisi Bay . Highway 17 runs across the south end of this bay , making it a possible bail-out or start point . We headed north out of the bay back into the river . Right at the exit from Pimisi Bay is Decharge des Perches , a small rapid . We found only a row of timber cribbing with a shallow rock garden beyond it . We paddled straight through with a few bumps . The river opened up into a small pond about 400 m in diameter . The river drained from this pond through a small rapid , which required a mix of running , lining and wading . Portage de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did n't  have to do . The low water meant that we simply had to get through with a mix of walking and lining . <p> About 500 m further down the river , we arrived at Petit Paresseux Falls . We scouted the run from the portage trail . The portage was flat , but very rocky with hundreds of tree roots exposed by compaction and erosion . The rapid itself was shallow for the most part , with a deeper section from the centre to the end . A sweeper crossed the entire river except for a 4 ft . Space at river left where someone had thoughtfully cut out a section of the tree . There was no falls in the run when we saw it , only two small ledges at the end which both appeared to be runnable . We waded the first ( shallow ) section of the rapid , then jumped into the canoes as the water deepened . The rest of the rapid was a simple run which involved weaving between the many boulders . <p> Another km downstream we arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing that this falls has an 8 m drop , we did n't  bother scouting . We ate lunch in the small clearing at the beginning of the trail , then started slugging the gear through . The portage trail was level at first , then turned rocky - very rocky . It was obvious that the trail had once been part of the river bed , since it was strewn with large round boulders . It looked just like a section of river bed , minus the water . There was a steep downhill section at the end and a rocky put in . Even though there was n't much water going over Paresseux Falls , it was still spectacular , spanning the 100 m or so across the river with water flowing over a vertical drop . Very pretty . <p> The river turned from north-south to an east-west direction right after the falls . We kept an eye out on the north ( left ) bank for Porte de LEnfer , a cave about 5 m above river level . This cave is the site of an ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxide . This material was ground into a fine powder and used as the basis for pictograph paint . Getting up to the cave involves a scramble up a very steep embankment covered with loose material . Toeholds are small , and the only handholds are the cedar roots protruding from the ground . A slip would mean a bumpy roll and a splash-landing back in the river , since there is no level shoreline at this point . The cave is not a large one , but is still worth a visit . The floor slopes steeply down to the river , so a slip inside the cave would probably have the same result as a slip outside it . Someone has taken the time and trouble to climb one of the walls and decorate it with graffiti in blue spray paint . One has to wonder at the compulsion which makes some people feel the need to paint their name on every rock surface they see . Doing it in an important historical / cultural / religious site like this must require a particularly low level of intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught doing this should be barred from the wilderness for life . A careful slide down the steep embankment put us back at our canoes . <p> We paddled east for about 2 km and arrived at Elm Point . It was n't quite as far as wed planned on going , but when we saw the site we knew we had to stay . Similar to Graswell Point , it had a grassy area in the centre , and the shoreline was all white sandy beach . A rocky stream runs down the hill and into the river on the west side of the site . The elm tree that provided the name for the site is pretty bedraggled - mostly dead with one or two live branches . In a spirit of abject laziness , we stopped for the night and set up camp . Took a Caribbean-style photo of the group with everyone lounging on the sand in bathing suits and sunglasses . A relaxing afternoon fishing , playing cards and swimming . Late dinner of Chile and baked potatoes at 7:30 pm . Very cold out - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the warm clothing that we had n't  even unpacked to this point Coffee at the campfire and an early bedtime . Everyone else stayed up until about 10:00 , but I crashed at about 9:00 to write in the journal and get some sleep - tired , with a sore back . <p> Day Four ( 20 km / 3 portages or rapids ) <p> Our lazy paddling schedule from the day before meant that we would probably not be out in Mattawa by noon as we had originally planned . We were up at 8:00 am and on the water by 9:30 am . Still cool , and spectacular mist over the water . We paddled through this fog and mist until almost noon . <p> About 2 km downstream , we arrived at Les Epingles , a small swift . Niel and Gil ran down the centre , but bottomed out a few times . The rest of us lined down the left side . Even 3 or 4 inches more water would have made it a simple riffle . Immediately after Les Epingles , we arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two separate sections , a boulder garden at the start , then the main rapid a little further on . The portage only goes around the main section . We weaved our way through the small bouldery section , then pulled out at the portage to scout the remainder . Too low to run - thousands of boulders protruding . Unfortunately it was n't lineable either , since the deep centre channel was far removed from the rocky shoreline . There werent enough rocks to walk on at this location . We resigned ourselves to walking the trail with our gear . It quickly became obvious why it is called Portage des Roches ( Rocks ) . The path is covered with round stones ranging is size from baseball to pumpkin size . It is a continual decision as to whether one should step gingerly between the rocks , or try to walk on top of the rocks . Regardless of the choice , this is prime ankle-spraining country . We made it through without injury and were back on the water by 11:00 am . Another 2 km east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park . As with every other rapid on the trip , this one was dry . It split into two channels and ran past the park . The portage was not necessary . One group paddled / bumped / waded their way down the right channel , and the rest of us lined and waded down the left side . Stopped at the downstream end of the portage ( park road ) and walked into the park to see if the voyageur exhibits were still set up . Nope ... the bark canoe was gone , and we only got to see a glass display case with a couple of artifacts . Back on the river and continuing to paddle east towards Mattawa . <p> The next 6 km involved uneventful river paddling - nice section , with little development and high , steep walls on both sides of the river . As soon as we hit Chant Plain Lake , the development / cottages began . A monotonous 4 km further brought us to the dam at the east end of Chant Plain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy , and caving it at sections . We chose instead to land on a small spit of land against the dam at the south side . Half of the group went on top of the dam , and the others handed up gear and canoes to them . The other side of the dam at this point is a gravel parking lot . Leading from this parking area is a road which leads downhill and eventually intersects the portage trail . This was much , much easier than using the portage . <p> The next km of river was very shallow . The riverbed was covered with thousands of planks and timbers , obviously from a lumber operation in the area . Three more km of boring paddling through the town of Mattawa ( houses , cottages , boats , airplanes , etc ) and we arrived at the Ottawa River . We went under the highway bridge into the Ottawa River and turned south under the long steel railway bridge . Another couple of km and we arrived at our vehicles , parked at the dock by Valois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After boosting it and loading the gear , we headed up to Valois to eat lunch ( 3:00 pm lunch , that is ) . Huge hamburgers and fries , guaranteed to undo any cardiovascular good we might have done for ourselves during the trip . <p> Drove back to North Bay to get the other vehicle , then back home to Sudbury . The final verdict ? Unless you really like large lake paddling , skip Trout Lake at the start . Its a nice lake , but quite developed - certainly not the high point of the trip . Another good section to skip would be the section right at the town of Mattawa . Crowded with cottages and development . It was quiet when we were there ( mid-Sept ) but I 'm sure it would be a madhouse in the summer . <p> If we were to do the route again , we 'd make it a three-day trip and start at the Picnic area at the east end of Trout Lake ( by the Stepping Stones ) . We 'd stay the first night on Pine Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Talon Dam on the second night . We 'd finish at the Park . A good fall trip - I 'm sure its a busy route in the summer , and its accessible at many locations along its length by canoeists and boaters ( and local partyers ) .

We stoped for a snack at one of Turtle lake islands . The place was quite rough for the campsite there is just rocks , routes and no flat place to put a tent . At the end of the day we arrived to Portage de la Mauvaise Musique . We knew that there is a swampy area before the portage , thanks to the log of the trip left on this site . Otherwise we would newer think that there is one . We crawled and poled our way to beaver dam . Than we paddled another 200 yards before we got to the portage . Ministry of the Natural Resources may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thrown in shallow water and it looked like was there for a while . We portaged to the Pine Lake and camped there overnight . There is couple of campsites on the small islands . Had to spend some time to clean it from rusted tins and broken bottles . Otherwise it nice place to stay . Next day we portage to Talon Lake . We meet another party and they told us that they choose another route through three portages from the Turtle lake to Talon Lake . They stopped overnight at the trailer park at the North part of Talon Lake . There are pretty many cottages and moderate boat traffic over the Talon Lake . Grasswell Point is the best place to camp over here . There are four of five separate campsites most of them were available . We did past two trailer parks at the East End of the lake . There is possibility to put-in for the short trip . There is also small store , not much in . The bigger store and the Beer store are a mile down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra propane tank which store did not have . Talon Dam portage is really bad . Steep rocks , boulders and beaten path . Kids enjoy jumping in the water from rock crops down from waterfall . Pimisi Bay past the portage has one or two access points . You may actually see HWY 17 from here . Portage Decharge des Perches was just walked through . We stopped overnight before Paresseux Falls . Next one Paresseux Falls had a waterfal , so we portaged through . There were few more portages past the falls , but we just walked canoes through with exception of may be one . Always worth to scout it first . The part between Paresseux Falls and Samuel le Champlain Park is the beauties part of the river . It is secluded , does have enough sites large enough and wonderful sandy beaches . We found that some people who not interested to go far just put in at the park and going upstream untill reaching desirable site . There is no current anyway . What called river in this section is just a sequience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Park . One was a little swift , and there was enough water at Champion Rapids . We called the outfitter from the park store and were picked up in no time . All route may be done in two days instead of three with some effort . We did really appriciated detailed notes left on that site by Richard , Joe , Don and co . Thanks . <p> Submitted by : Mike 22Wng on 2010-05-13 <p> This was very helpful . There are , however , 10 portages . I went early in the season , April 15 , 2010 and things were a bit different . If you are planning to make a trip , make sure you pay attention for the portage signs . Some have been pushed over and most of them have no more wood- as it has been stolen . At the Portage des Roches the sign has been knocked down- and you have to have a keen eye so as not to get sucked down the rapids .

But what is that weird looking bent paddle for and how does it really work ? <p> Paddling a canoe involves more than just pulling your paddle through the water . There is a bit of physics that needs to be looked at to truly appreciate the bent shaft paddle . <h> The Paddle Stroke <p> The average paddler places the most force on the paddle during the last part of the stroke . This is because both the arms and the upper body are in the best position to allow the greatest force to be applied . This is the power portion of the paddle stroke . <p> Unfortunately , a straight shaft paddle is not at the best angle with respect to the canoe to efficiently transfer this energy into forward motion . <h> The Straight Shaft Paddle <p> Using a straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canoe slightly down into the water . This happens because the paddle is not perpendicular with the canoe . The resistance of the water keeping the canoe afloat acts against force of the power stroke while the remaining energy moves the canoe forward . <h> The Bent Shaft Paddle <p> When using a bent shaft paddle the blade face is perpendicular to the canoe during the power portion of the stroke . Because of this , the force applied is efficiently directed to the forward motion of the canoe . This results in less effort to move the canoe in a forward direction . <h> So Which Type of Paddle is Best ? <p> Although the bent shaft paddle is more efficient than a straight shaft in propelling a canoe forward there are some things that should be noted . <p> Bent shaft paddles were born from racing canoes . They deliver the most forward force for the energy expended . Their one disadvantage is the lack of canoe maneuverability in fast water . They work well when your main goal is to go forward but when maneuverability counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This is because a straight blade paddle reacts the same way regardless of which way you use it . If you are doing a draw and suddenly need to pry , the straight blade paddle acts the same in both directions . Do the same with a bent shaft paddle , and it becomes a different animal depending on the orientation of the paddle face . Because of the bend , it will not react the same way in both directions and could mean the difference between running up a rock or hitting that perfect eddy . <p> When paddling lakes I always use my bent shaft . ( It 's a 12-degree bend for those that want to know . ) It allows me to shorten the length of my paddle stroke and reduce the physical stress of paddling for long distances . <p> When river running I trust my straight shaft paddle to get me through . It let 's me maneuver through the currents in a way that a bent shaft would never allow . <p> Try both in differing situations . You 'll be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight is your favorite I 'm sure you will learn to love both for their different properties if you give them a chance . <p> Dave Gillen has been a canoeist and camper for over 20 years .

Travel east to McElrea Lake to reach the first portage . Both Mount Lake and McElrea Lake contain pike and lake trout . PORTAGE #1 McElrea Lake to Rottier Lake - 576 metres The portage is located to your right on the south side of McElrea Lake about a half mile east from the narrows between Mount Lake and McElrea Lake . Proceed up the hill over this portage . Head east along the south shore of Rottier Lake to - PORTAGE #2 Rottier Lake to Grey Trout Lake - 198 metres This portage is located on the south shore of the lake about 68 kilometers east of the creek which flows into Rottier Lake from Grey Trout Lake . This is a very level portage and the easiest one of the trip .

Side trips may be taken to Bilton Lake , Rainbow Lake and Rosemarie Lake or proceed east to - PORTAGE #4 Rawhide Lake to Little Sister Lake - 455 metres At the easterly end of Rawhide Lake , there is an island with a cabin on it . The bay in which the portage is located is on the south side about halfway between the island and the end of the lake . The trail is just west of the creek that flows into Rawhide Lake from Little Sister Lake . There is a sand beach here . The latter part of the trail follows the creek .

It is the most difficult portage of the trip because of a steep hill . The shore of the lake is rocky here . The trail goes up a small hill , then down through an alder swale , up a larger hill , levels off and the last half is downhill to Book Lake . Proceed south to - PORTAGE #6 Book Lake to the Boland River - 1,881 metres This portage is located by paddling into the creek which flows out of the south end of the lake and is on the east side of the creek , to your left , at the beaver dam . There is a campsite here . The trail is long but level . It is located on the east side of the creek for one-third of the way - 621 metres . Cross the creek just before it joins the creek from Rosemarie Lake . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After having travelled about three-quarters of the total length of the trail - 1,485 metres , cross the Rosemarie Creek to the east side . There is a large log jam here . It is easy to cross if care is taken . The last quarter of the trail passes through a stand of red and white pine and spruce trees . It is the best walking of the whole trip . At the end of the trail is a campsite . The remainder of the trip is all downstream . The number of portages will depend upon the time of year and the water levels . The only rapids encountered will be at the junction of the Rosemarie Creek where it enters the Boland River . There are several campsites along the Boland River . The only portaging on the river will be to get around log jams . Some of these , the canoe may be lifted over , but two in particular , the canoes must be carried around .

Nice people at the lodge ( Judy ) shuttled our truck to the 639 bridge for $20 . They have a nice clean camp that you can stay at if you wanted to spend the night . You can also arrange shuttles at Frontier lodge on the east shore of McElrea Lake , but cost is greater . A road goes from Fronteir Lodge to the dock on Rottier if you wish to avoid the first portage . You MUST have 4X4 truck to use this road due to the grade . <p> I personally would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lakes are pretty , but they are heavily used by two outfitter camps . Lots of tin boats , boat caches , generator noise . The old 576 portage from McElrea to Rottier lake does not exist now .

You will see a red pumphouse shack on the right side , with a black plastic 28 " dia. water line coming down the hill . A gravel access road has been whacked in on the left bank . Follow this road northest for approx. 350m , then hook to the right up the steep 35-40 degree grade hill . You will pass a trail marked by a painted paddle on the right " water falls " . This 100m trail takes you to a scenic canyon falls . Stay on the gravel road and you end up at the Rottier Lake docks . Big boat cache and wooden docks .

A nice camp site with room for at least three tents . Lots of garbage left by outfitter clients . Three boats fishing . Nights stay ruined by very loud generator noise coming from Frontier Lodge on McElrea . Went until at least 11:00 pm . <p> Large boat cache at 216 start into Rawhide . Portage is good . Very large boat cache blocking portage on Rawhide side . Lots of garbage at landing . Four tin boats fishing and large lodge with 5+ cabins on northest shore . Ptretty lake with quite a few sites . Nice big scree slopes along the shore . Trolled spoons across Rottier , Grey Trout and Rawhide - no luck for lake trout . <p> Portage from Rawhide to L. Sister is good . You end up at an outfitters brand new white cedar log dock . The L Sister to book lake portage is not 909 meters . Its 1500 meters with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campsite that can hold several tents at the southeastern side of Book Lake , right at the portage takeout . Do not start this portage later in the day if you 're feeling burned out . A straight carry one way wityh the canoe , at fast walk , took me 42 minutes . This $$#$$#@#@ portage is no 1880 . It is closer to 2925-3000 . You cross a gravel road approx. 1/2 way through it . This is where I would leave atruck if I wanted to just paddle the river . The next half of the portage is not maintained - at least 30 blowdowns blocking trail . <p> You hit the Boland R. when you drop down hill into a gray alder swamp . There is one tiny grassed area here for one tent . If you opt to go downriver , be prepared to go at least 10km and two logjams before you start to find a site . The first one you see is on a left shore sand bank , under jack pine . An outfitters moose bivouac frame and picnic table are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hit the bridge . We portaged at least 16 of these . The pullovers were marginal . You will break your loaded canoes back if the water drops another 4 " . I thank the poor buggers who have recently hacked their way through the gray alder/ninebark to bypass the jams . No flag tape marking any portages . Only one sign found . An idling chainsaw in my wifes hands would have been welcomed . <p> The meandering/oxbows were a little too much for us. we do n't  mind a bit , but 35km with little change in the landscape is a bit too much for us . A birders paradise ! At least 15 species of wood warblers . The highlight of the trip is to see the old growth white and jack pine . Beautiful . Lots of moose/bear hunters tree stands along the river . <p> An additional gravel access road entry point aboout midway down the river ( between eastings 71 and 72 on the NTS .

We caught four brook trout.Biggest was 2 lbs . We only found fish in the pools where creek mnouths joined the river . <p> Nice to have done it , but not our cup of tea with the 22 jams and the constant meandering . River has a surprisingly good current to it for one that meanders so much . Lily dip paddle would push you at 5.5 kph . Hard paddle was up to 8.5kph . Not much wildlife when compared to other trips we 've done . Very little moose sign . Moderate beaver activity . have fun if you go . <p> Dave <p> Boland River - July 22 - 27 2002 <p> The four of us , ( Bill , Ken , Neal , and Bob ) left London at 6:02 AM on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilderness Lodge about 5:30 PM . Most of the trip up was light traffic , the heaviest around Sudbury . It rained as we travelled through the Sudbury area . I had contact with the Wilderness Lodge the previous Saturday . A price was agreed upon , which gave us a place for our 2 tents for the first night , parking for the car and to have it delivered to the bridge on Hwy 639 on Saturday . Supper here , was soup , hamburgers from home and rhubarb muffins , all washed down with red wine . <p> We had a good breakfast in the Lodge on Tuesday morning and were on the water by 8:30 AM . As we paddled Mount Lake we noticed the cottages , more importantly , we felt the energy of an adventure . As we paddled into McElrea Lake , the anticipation of the first portage was felt . One of the route descriptions we used mentioned the portage was " about half a mile east of the narrows " . We started looking about 600 M east of the narrows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new road ( portage ) at the end of McElrea L. We did n't  explore it . We retraced our route and about 240 M east of the Narrows ( I know , where do you start to measure the distance - from the beginning or end ) on the south side of the lake . There was red paint about 2 M up on a white Birch tree . I marked a waypoint ( Lat. 46 40 15.56182 " ; Long . -82 42 35.39190 " ) at the beginning . The end of Portage 1 , I marked a waypoint ( Lat. 46 39 59.45569 " ; Long . -82 42 25.77457 ) again . The portage ( 642 M ) was what I call primitive . In other words , it was there , you had to work a little to follow it . The portage ( 576 M ) at the end of McElrea Lake is marked on a map called Elliot Lake and Blind River Area . It is based on NTS 1:250 000 scale digital data , with data from 1:50 000 topo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( about $10 ) . <p> Rottier Lake appeared in various shades of emerald green . The scree slopes along the southwest end were interesting . The short paddle across the lake was punctuated by motor boats ferrying a group of fishermen out . We had a brief talk . We both thought the other was crazy in regards to our preferred mode of transport . The portage trail from Rottier to Grey Trout was easy . At the end a turn to the right provided you with a new cedar dock and several boats . If you took a sightly trail to the left , you arrived at a nice open area for a couple of tents . There were 2 boats here and no dock . Our lunch of pumpernickel bread and canned ham ( with mustard ) and beans was eaten here . <p> Grey Trout Lake was another emerald green lake . The cliffs along the southern shore were a rock hounds delight . The paddle was short , with beautiful scenery . The third portage into Rawhide Lake was also easy . <p> Rawhide Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our face . It soon changed and we enjoyed the wind at our back for the rest of the paddle . We paddled the south shore looking at the cliffs and the different fracture lines in the rock face . We made camp ( Tuesday Day 2 ) , about 4:30 PM at the eastern end ( Lat. 46 39 07.39080 " ; Long . -82 36 26.74695 " ) of the lake .. The surface rock was very interesting . Supper was soup ( with fresh onions and pasta shells ) , Alpine spaghetti ( olive oil , parsley , sweet Basil and liquid gralic and Parmesan cheese ) , and chocolate pudding . Tea and coffee goes with every meal . We left the next morning at 8:25 AM and arrived at the portage at 9:15 AM . <p> We arrived at Little Sister Lake at 10:35 AM after relatively easy 455 M portage . This lake was surrounded by interesting hills . A short 10 minute paddle had us at the fifth portage before we were ready . We found this 909 M portage to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with some little dips wore us out . The rocks of the cliffs , that we could see were a stiff price to pay .

This was the best camp site of the entire trip . There was lots of space , a steady wind , and a fire pit area . We had lunch of coffee/tea , soup , rye crisp with corned beef ( mustard and hot ketchup ) . By 6 PM wed sleep for 3 hours . Supper was started about 7 PM . It was soup again , with sweet and sour curried rice and butterscotch pudding . Like the evening before , the bugs drove us into the tents and hence bed by 9 PM . We were up as the sun was driving the wild horses from the bays . We were on the water at 8:20 AM after a breakfast of instant oatmeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portage . <p> We were advised that the water was low . Now we found out how low . The water level at the mouth of the creek was so low we could not get into the creek . We had to bush wack about 100 M just to get to the beginning of the portage trail . Once we were on the trail ( 9 AM ) our shuttle walk started . To accomplish this shuttle the first load is carried for about 125 steps ( count each time a foot is put down ) . The return walk is the rest period . The next shuttle distance is 250 steps . This 250 step shuttle walk and return rest phase is done until the portage is complete . We crossed the logging road about half way over the portage . Lunch here , was soup , with peanut butter and jam on 7 grain bread . It was surprising fresh and no mould . Rosemarie Creek was crossed only once by us . There were numerous blow downs in the second half of the portage . All four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Rosemarie Creek to the east side . We literally walked into the Boland River 180 M down stream from where we had planned . This portage took about 5 hours for us to do . I have never walked all day on a portage before in my 39 years of canoeing . It certainly was an interesting experience . The blow-downs were a challenge . We were however , not as physically tired as the day before ( coming into Book Lake ) . I bared my sole with Ken as both my running shoes lost theirs . It was my back up hiking sandals for the rest of the trip . <p> Our camp on Thursday ( Day 4 ) was beside on an old logging road ( Lat. 46 36 33.08868 ; Long . -82 33 18.70693 " ) . It looked like rain , so Bill and I put up the tarp . The tarp fulfilled its purpose , the rain did n't  come . It did spit a couple of times , that was all however . Supper began with soup ( with fresh onion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dessert . Breakfast was pancakes and real maple syrup . The four of us were on the river by 8:30 AM . <p> Our river trip had now begun . On Wednesday , we had not reached our intended camping spot . This put us about 5 hours behind on our schedule . A quick meeting decided that we would attempt to do half the distance to the bridge on Friday and the remaining distance on Saturday . <p> Our original plan had us at the bridge on Hwy 639 about 12 noon . <p> Fridays ( Day 5 ) paddle went slower than planned . This was caused by the number of logjams we encountered . We had 3 trip reports with us . Only one had a date with it . This report mentioned there were 4 major ones , another report mentioned a total of 22 logjams/fallen trees . In our planning meetings ( yes , we did have 3 or 4 ) we let our excitement about the trip cloud our eyes to the number of logjams ( well , enough of the crying and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddle we had covered a straight line distance of about 8 km , on the river that converts to about 13.76 km . It also included many logjams , duck-unders and a few pull-overs .

Coffee and tea was had before the bugs rushed us off to bed . At this site I saw 2 or 3 day old bear prints , and a number of moose prints . Breakfast was coffee/tea and rice pudding/instant cream of wheat . We were on the water early . <p> Saturdays ( Day 6 ) paddle started at 8 AM and we did n't  get off the river until 9:25 PM . In a straight line we travelled just over 11 km . According to the river we paddled 23.76 km . This included 24 logjams and duck-unders . To say the least , it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had the canoes tied on and the gear in the trailer . We spent the night in Sudbury , arriving at 2 AM - ending a 20 hour day . <p> As I sit writing this report 2 days later , I still feel the physical drain . The Boland River at this time of year ( July22 - 27 ) had very little water in it . Yet , it is a dynamic river . The river water was cold , in the deep pools the trout were hiding . The riverbed is constantly changing , the currents change , the meanders I found provided a look at the formation of the valley the Boland erodes . This trip will be remembered for the physical challenge , the beauty of the smaller lakes , the wonderful stands of pine trees , and of course the log jams . With excellent 20/20 hindsight , we should have planned 6 days on the water . The water was low , however , it was the number of logjams that slowed our progress . <p> Bob Shiell 134049 @qwx994049 <p> BookLakeIsland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photo Credit : Ken Sumnall ) <p> The end of the long portage - we stepped right into Boland River . <p> ( Photo Credit : Ken Sumnall ) <p> First day lunch ! . <p> ( Photo Credit : Ken Sumnall ) <p> We did n't find any sites on the south side of Rawhide , this site was rough . 
@@107413025 @2813025/ 134045 @qwx994045 134054 @qwx994054 <p> This report describes the canoe trip that I , Frank Boyaner , and my friend , Henry took in mid-August 1998 in Algonquin Park , Ontario . It was a " loop " that started at the Cedar Lake Brent campground and then went through Catfish and Burntroot lakes , and finished up on a section of the Nipissing River ending back at Cedar Lake . Including the four hour drives from/to Ottawa , the trip took four days and three nights from Thursday morning to Sunday night . I familiarized myself with the route by reading Kevin Callans excellent paddlers guide to Algonquin park : " Brook Trout and Blackflies " . Our equipment consisted of Henrys ultra light 42 lb , 16.5 foot Kevlar canoe , two 140 litre canoe packs and two 20-40 litre knapsacks . <p> Please note that if you do n't  already have the Algonquin Park map , you can download it from the internet . <p> The drive on highway 17 from Ottawa to Deux-RiviTres was very pleasant on the Thursday morning . Contrast that with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pembroke through Ottawa have a well-deserved reputation for dangerous passing maneuvers . The dirt road from the highway to the park boundary is smooth and maintained . Registration is at #25 at the fork in the road . Once inside the park boundary , the road to Brent is rough : washboard , rocky and narrower . Its worth stopping at the wooden viewing tower on the right to see the edge of the Brent meteorite crater . Information pamphlets are available there that explain its origin . The drive from highway to Brent takes at least 45 minutes . This more difficult access helps keep this part of the park less crowded . <p> We started across Cedar Lake at 1:00 on the Thursday by heading south to P(ortage)715 . There is a nice waterfall to the right of the portage but since we were pressed for time to reach Catfish lake we did n't  go to see it . The P2345 was tough since it was our first day . I seem to get more used to the effort of portaging as the days pass and find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do single-pass portages and Henrys lightweight canoe helped make that possible . <p> We reached Catfish by 5:30 . According to Kevin Callan , the nicest campsite is the one on the point in the lower part of Catfish east of the island site in the middle of the lake . But by that time of day , it was taken , as were all of the other good sites . We backtracked to the one in the narrows to the left of the letter C in Catfish on the map . I soon found out why it was still available . The entire site , except for the tent pad , slants towards the water . This makes cooking interesting . Everything that you put down rolls toward the lake . Except for the slope , its actually a nice site . For the rest of the days , I realized that claiming a campsite by 4:00 ensures that you get the nice ones . <p> Friday morning , we headed south on Catfish . For a larger lake , its not too wide and makes for a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days by 9:15 . Between Catfish and Catfish Rapids , on the Petawawa , we saw my first pair of Algonquin moose ; a mother and young one . The river narrows but they were comfortable with us passing within 50m . The water was shallow in spots and we had to get out and walk the canoe but there 's a sandy bottom . <p> Make special note of the campsite on the small peninsula in the first half of Perley Lake on the North shore . We stopped for lunch there and I do n't  remember ever having lunch at a nicer spot than that . The peninsula rises constantly uphill to a height of about 50m . The forest is open and occupied by very tall White Pine trees . There was a cool breeze blowing from the west right up the peninsula hill . The sound of the wind blowing constantly through the pine needles was very soothing . <p> On Burntroot we were fortunate to find a very nice campsite available . Its on the first island with two campsites and the better site is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a lot of trouble to carry &amp; position the numerous flat rocks in helpful ways . On the south shore they built a breakwater to make landing the canoe in a westerly wind an easy task . On the west shore they arranged a seat with a back rest in order to enjoy the sunsets and on the north shore there 's a nice swimming area . In the cooking area a large flat rock serves as a table . Note that the view west includes a small island with two lone pine trees towering over the island . Its a wonder that high winds have n't yet blown them down . One minor drawback is the many sea gulls on a small nearby island . They did n't  come over to our island but they made enough noise to mask the sound of the loons . The other campsite , on the eastern half and south shore of the island is very dark and not very attractive . Its probably used for the overflow from the nicer site . <p> Saturday , we had a big day ahead of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Nipissing to be able to exit at a reasonable time Sunday . Robinson lake , in my opinion , is the perfect width for canoeing ; not too big and wide to feel like you 're making no progress ; yet not too narrow either . It also has a very nice elevated campsite on the tip of an island . <p> The P1930 after Remona Lake is very nice as far as portage trails go . To pass the time on the portage , I counted my paces : 2200 to reach the canoe rack rest stop and 4000 in total for the portage . While on the P850 we received our only rain of the trip ; a brief but strong thunderstorm . The trail is grown over with tall , thick grass and bushes , so if they are wet , you will be too . <p> The Nipissing river has short stretches of very shallow water . You will scratch your canoe and get your feet wet , but its worth it . Its a quiet , meandering river and well worth the effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portage , the P1410 , without having to take it . The river was very quiet , with several herons and ducks and lots of curves . After about three hours of meandering we started to look forward to the campsite ; any campsite . While some parts of the river have a current , for the most part the current is not a determining factor for which way you choose to travel . Many people do the route in the opposite direction , saving the portages for then end when they carry less food weight . <p> I had originally booked a campsite for this night anywhere between the upcoming P365 and P180 . But because of Kevin Callans recommendation of the beautiful High Falls site upstream , I switched our reservation to that site when we obtained our permit at the registration building . Only while en route did I realize that there was no way we could get from High Falls to Ottawa in one day . There is only the one site on the stretch of the river after the meanders and we were fortunate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large site and can be shared . It has a very peaceful view of a meadow/marshland across the river . I 'll warn you that if you go in for a swim , the fish were very hungry . <p> Sunday morning saw us out on the river while the early morning steam was still rising off the water and the dew was glistening in the eastern sun . This was one of those " this is why I canoe " scenes . <p> Some notes here : The P365 , P110 &amp; P180 may have their distances wrong on the map and their signs mixed up but its not a significant error . I believe the P110 should be marked as P180 and the P180 is actually P280 . There 's a nice swimming pool area at the end of one of these portages ; I believe its the last one but I do n't  remember exactly which one it is . <p> The lower Nipissing is known as moose territory and we were treated to seeing seven of them . It took a while for the moose ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow river so that we could pass by without startling them . The last moose was our first male sighted . Even though he was standing right at the entrance to the P2835 , he chose instead to swim across the river and disappear into the thick undergrowth of the woods . We stopped for lunch at the campsite one hour after the P2835 , at a major bend in the river . Its another top-of-a-hill site that 's well worth the climb . Once up there , you can enjoy the unique view looking both upstream and downstream of the bend in the river . <p> Its always a great feeling when you know you 're doing the last portage , and in our case the P915 was no exception . I felt stronger after several days of , according to my friend Henry , portaging with some canoeing in between . Plus the trail is very smooth and wide . Then it was out the Cedar Lake delta and back to Brent . <p> Here are the numbers : Distance : total 60 km , canoed 49 km , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Travel time : total 22 hrs , canoed 12.5hrs , portaged 9.5hrs , percentage of time portaging : 43% ! ! ! Average speeds : paddling : 4 km/hr , portaging : 2.5 km/hr including 4 minutes on average for unloading the canoe and 4 minutes to load . While most unloads/loads take 2-3 minutes some take much longer . <p> Coincidentally , each day had five portages . That 's one of the reasons why Thursday , the first ( half ) day was the most difficult . 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @qwx994055 <p> Just finished this loop with our Scout Troop . Had a fantastic time ! Highly reccomend the island site on Catfish with the bent tree over hanging the water on the west side or the site east across on the pennisula . Enjoyed the western site on the island on Burntroot Lake . We did the High Falls to end of Nippising/Cedar Lake in one 8 hr day .

Enjoy ! <p> Submitted by : Alex Ferentzy on 0000-00-00 <p> Just back from this trip . My two kids an I did it as a five day trip including all the driving . In the spring Catfish and Sunfish are more like one big lake rather than two lakes connected by a creek and marshland . To get a sense of this compare the Canoe routes of Algonquin map with the Algonquin 2 - Northwest map which use two very diferent ways to depict the route from Catfish to Sunfish . I say this because we were looking for the narrow part of Catfish which never materialized and we were well into Sunfish before we realized we had gone well past the portage . Not a big deal unless you are in bad weather or nasty winds . <p> Submitted by : Chris Lawson on 2009-04-05 <p> I did this trip solo in 2004 .

I agree the first portage on the first day is the worst all up hill . after that anything is a piece of cake . I took the same four days to do the trip and only encounted two other people the whole trip . I travel light , no tent , minimum of gear , I do pack in more than enough food which makes my camp stay really worth while . on this route I only encounted four moose nearly ran into one on the Nippising river , paddling too close to the shore on one of the bends , we both did a bit of fast moving , The only part of the trip that required skill was crossing cedar lake in the wind , I used a spray skirt for that , If you do the trip be sure to look for the Aligator tug on an island in Catfish lake .

While we did not mind paddling the Key , we did have to contend with a lot of motorized boat traffic . The Key River is a major boating channel - it is marked along its length with channel buoys , and battling the wake from this traffic gets a bit tiresome . <p> At the suggestion of my wife Debbie , the second time we paddled this route we reversed the direction of travel . This meant that we paddled the Key River first ( on Friday ) and missed the busy weekend boat traffic . Sunday was spent paddling the much quieter Pickerel River . <p> Base your trip direction on the days you will be paddling the route - try to avoid being on the Key River on a weekend . <p> Day One ( Friday ) We started out trip at the intersection of the Key River and Highway 69 , at Key Marina .

While we unloaded our gear at the dock and began to pile it into the canoes , a couple of our group members shuttled one vehicle back to Pickerel Marina ( 15 km north up the highway ) to use when we finished our trip . <p> The Key River is pleasant but not spectacular . It is a typical Canadian Shield river , with lots of bare granite and twisted trees , with many reedy areas along the shoreline . We did see quite a few herons and other shorebirds along this section . Boat traffic was not heavy , but enough that we would have to deal with bow waves from a powerboat every half hour or so . Most of the south shoreline is the Henvey Reserve ( from Hwy 69 until about 3km from the end of the Key ) , so camping is not permitted . The north shoreline varies between isolated-sections and areas with quite a few cottages . <p> Shortly after lunch , we arrived at the end of the Key River ... Georgian Bay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiate , and it was calm when we arrived , but even a moderate west wind would have meant battling large waves on this section . It is possible to avoid some of the waves by heading north immediately and trying to skirt the shoreline behind Germain Island as you head north into Whistler Bay . <p> We stopped for the day at the island just east of Puddick Island , a short 3 1/2 km paddle from the end of the Key River . The island is unnamed on maps , but we have always referred to it as " Happy Face " island , because some thoughtless visitor decided to express his artistic talents by painting a large happy face on one of the shoreline rocks . There is a cottage at the northern tip of the island . The campsite is on the east shore about halfway down the island . There is a large open area of flat rock along the waterfront for cooking , relaxing and soaking up some afternoon sunshine . The tent sites are a little further back towards the centre of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough on this island to find a Massassauga Rattler . This small , shy snake is quite endangered , but the north shore of Georgian Bay is its home territory . The snake left the open rock where it was warming itself , disappeared into the bush and we did n't  see it again during our stay . <p> Day Two ( Saturday ) We were on the water at 9:30 am and headed northwest toward the mouth of the Pickerel River . The next 10 km or 11 km of the river is part of French River Provincial Park . Formed in 1989 , it is a waterway park based on a corridor which includes portions of the French and Pickerel Rivers . This section of the Pickerel River where we spent day two was the best part of the route . It is quiet and secluded , and passes through some wonderful narrow sections with sculpted rock walls on both sides . <p> At the 20 km point of the trip ( about 5 1/2 km north of the mouth of the Pickerel ) we encountered the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short ( less than 100 m ) carry around the left side of a small pond . Alternatively , it would be possible to do a short liftover into the pond , wade the canoes through , and then do a short 30 m portage at the end to get back into the river . It was n't worth packing the gear too neatly - as soon as we were back in the water , we took a small channel to the left and were faced with the second portage - a narrow channel blocked by rock at both ends . In low water conditions , the entire trail has to be taken - about 350 m on the left side of the river . It is marked with rock cairns along its length , and has a few climbs along the way . If water levels are higher , it is possible to do a short carryover into the narrow channel , and paddle / pole down along the shallow section of river . At the end , the channel is blocked with rock , so another short portage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a number of campsites along this section of the Pickerel River , although most of them are quite small . We waited until we left this section and entered the main east-west run of the Pickerel to find a site . There is a very shallow section at this junction which may require a liftover . We had to backtrack west on the river to find a site , and stayed at one of the spots shown on the French River Provincial Park map . It was up rather high off the river , but a nice site nonetheless . <p> Day Three ( Sunday ) Our final day on the river was a straight 15 km paddle east to Highway 69 and the Pickerel Marina , where we had left a shuttle vehicle . As you pass under the train trestle on the river , you are leaving French River Provincial Park . <p> We were lucky and caught a stiff breeze from the west the entire day on this section of the Pickerel . We hitched the canoes together , hoisted a tarp on some poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trip , piloted right into the marina by a would-be sailor in our group . <p> The final verdict ? The Key River is a little too busy for my taste , but the short section of Georgian Bay and especially the Pickerel River more than make up for it . A great novice-rated trip that could be enjoyed by a family .

A couple were recently killed ( June ' 03 ) on one of the rapids in the river , although I did not hear which one . <p> Given the size of the headwaters , the Nepisiguit can be run into mid July providing it has not been an overly dry summer .

The tiny whirlpools created by each paddle stroke stir up a grimmy brown trail behind each canoe . Thankfully , one can look back over the lake at majestic Mt Carelton and there is a realisation that the lake section of this trip is mercifully brief . <p> By late morning , one can notice a faint but percetable current in the reeds on either side of the narrowing lake . Around lunch time , a skidoo bridge is encountered , part of the vast network of trails in NB . <p> By mid afternoon , the southeastern branch of the Nepisiguit flows in from the south and there is a substantial increase the current although there are few obstacles and no rapids of note . Also , mountains begin to loom up on either side of the river giving it a majestic feel . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a logging bridge and across the river from the NBNR depot .

We had an up-close , personal experience with Blacky who got into our maple syrup during the middle of the night . After we stored our food on top of a vacant motor home , he voiced his displeasure by banging on the bottom of the ABS canoes that were turned upside down on the shoreline . <p> Day 2 <p> Similar to Day 1 , the river is quiet with only minor rips although a swift current helps eat away the kilometers . <p> A good spot to lunch is Poplar Depot on river left Back in the canoe , it is only a brief trip down to the rock garden above Indian Falls .

My father picked a line river right . As much as I hate to admit it , this proved to be a more suitable line . Total distance for the rock garden is is 800-1000m <p> For those not comfortable with this technical run , take the portage ( 1000m ) river left from the top of the rock garden to below Indian Falls . <p> Although most people who run the garden take out onto the portage trail at the point just above Indian Falls , a better alternative is river right where you can carry the canoe over a steep but short rock outcropping , cutting serious time and distance off the length of the portage . <p> For those experts who think that the falls ( a series of several drops ) have a seductive edge , your right . A friend and I scopped the last two drops for 45 minutes before attempting it . After setting up rescue boats , we ran a line river-left .

However , by early afternoon , this ends as you pass under a huge bridge and enter the headwaters of the Nepisiguit dam which are couple of k in length . <p> The portage around the dam is several hundred meters . This is an alternative take-out for the trip if so desired as it is easily accesible from Bathurst , although you will miss the best ww on the river if you do so . A more sensible option is to leave a vehicle here to deposit your gear in so that you can run the last portion of the river empty . <p> Day 4 <p> For expert canoeist , this is the creme de la creme of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dam by a friend , there are some CIV rapids located just down from the tailrace of the dam Sorry I ca n't comment on them from personal experience . <p> After several K of relatively flat , you hit a 250-300 m stretch of CIIIs , although these can turn into a CIII+ with higher water mainly from the massive standing waves in the center of the river . For those wishing to portage , there is ample opportunity on the right hand shore although it may be possible to alleviate those fears by hugging the same shoreline thus missing the worst ( best ? ) of the rapids . <p> A couple of K downriver , the river makes a sharp right-hand turn through a rock outcropping . Just above the bend is a CII+ set of rapids while just below around the bend is a bridge .

This tends to be a popular hang-out spot so expect teenagers milling about . <p> The portage follows the left hand shore for some 500m , by- passing the falls and the CIV rapids that lead out of the minature canyon . Although the falls would strictly be for expert kayakers , it is possible for canoeists put in just below the falls and run the 300m CIII-IV stretch . 3 canoes in our group ( sprayskirted ) ran it river left followed by a ferry to river right just above the CIV portion , reaching the relative safety of the far shore . <p> A friend an I took a similar line river left down to the CIV w/o a sprayskirt .

This will allow you to bail or just catch your breathe . Be forewarned that you will have to work hard to get out of this eddy as it is a keeper . Furthermore , it is closer to the IV than one would like , necessitating some heavy-duty paddling to line up the IV or the ferry across to river right . <p> Immediately around the corner from the " canyon " is a moderate class II to calm down the nerves after the last run . <p> After some 2-3K of flatwater , ther is another CIII although this could be CIII+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool below the rapids to bail . <p> Take out some 500m further on river right just above the bridge .

Too early in the spring - the force and panic seemed to be the factors- inexperienced canoeists should not touch this river till mid June - certain parts you can but poople down - not advisable .

We have seen others dump on the south side of ther river across from our camp and lose the canoe - in late May you can not try to cross this river - without their canoe they were stranded with no gear- not a relaxing situation . So although I " totally agree with the river being great to canoe - I never recommend any one unless they know what they are doing to try the river before Mid June .

Towns without a reliable food supply were Wrigley and Jean Marie . Norman Wells and Inuvik had the best variety . All others had adequate ( without being plentiful ) supplies , but came at a price . Peppers for example , were between $10-13 per kg . <p> Fresh fish makes a good protein source . Try to get some dryfish from the fish camps along the way for a tasty treat . I found that eggs worked well too ( with out the strong fish smell ) , assuming you don-t break them . Textured Vegetable Protein ( TVP ) is another option for a meat substitute . You-ll need to buy it before the trip though . Most - " health food- " stores will have it . <p> At all times I carried an extra 3 days of ( dehydrated ) food as an emergency backup . <p> Relying on towns for food meant that I was committed to reaching the next destination within a given time . If I had my own ( ie dehydrated ) food I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have felt ( at times ) less rushed . <p> Water Although always drinkable , water quality varied through out the trip , as did my treatment methods . I carried an MSR filter , a large ( 12L ) pot and purification solution . Depending on the situation I would generally boil water in the pot ( around 10min ) , let it settle over night then use if for the next day . <p> The solution and filter ( used about 4 times ) were mostly used with the clear water from side creeks and rivers or when I needed water immediately . <p> I carried water from Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk as a precaution . Water quality in the Gulf would depend on river flow and weather conditions . <p> Risk Management : A solo trip of this type poses inherent risks , as does driving a car , breathing air and listening to Dido . Due to the isolation and size of the river , emergency response times have the potential to be long . Having said that , the most dangerous thing I did on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River- <p> I carried a Satellite Phone with contact numbers for the RCMP in each town , coast guard bases in Hay River &amp; Inuvik as well as individual Coast Guard boats . Phone reception was a bit hit and miss and at times it didn-t work at all . Where possible , friends and family got regular updates as to my location . <p> I was also registered with the RCPM as part of their wilderness travelers programme . Flares were going to be used in an emergency to signal for help . I carried 4 , 2 of these didn-t work when I set them off after the trip . <p> Compressed-air horn and whistle were used to scare away bears and signal for help if needed . The horn worked well but broke on the 2nd day- <p> The GPS was used as a backup if needed - not a primary navigation tool . It was most useful in the Beaver Lake from Hay River to Ft Providence where the open water and tall reeds made accurate navigation difficult . <p> No gun , did I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? Maybe , I met others who used theirs to scare away bears . <p> A trip plan was made based on 40km per day - once I reached Ft Providence - and I found that this was a very achievable . The paddle from Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk took 4 days . 5km/hr was a good speed while going through beaver lake . <p> Bear Awareness Ideas : - Carry bear spray and do some research into being bear safe . - Reduce food odors by keeping food storage as airtight as possible . - Check the surrounding area for signs of bears before deciding to stop in that place . - Make noise and announce your presence to avoid finding yourself within the comfort zone of a startled bear . - Bears can and do swim to the river islands . - I had 2 bear encounters while cooking . When I spoke to them , the bears quickly went away but I still moved to a different campsite. - If confronted , make sure you give the bear a clear path to move away . - Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I moved between it and its cubs ? Did I cross its path of travel ? Am I covered in smelly fish guts and scales ? Am I camping at a site where people before me left food /rubbish ? - Above all , be aware of your surroundings at all times and if doubt , move on . <p> Yes , the locals will try to scare you with their horror bear stories- <p> Stuff to do differently / general comments : ? Get off the river more and explore . ? Go fishing more . ? Take longer and be more experience orientated than focused on km ( there were reasons for this - the amount of food carried was a factor ) , ? Go earlier in the year and see 24hrs sun up north . ? Research more into what-s happening at towns along the way ( I missed a number of events and community gatherings only by days ) . ? Get up earlier ( earliest on the water was about 10am while average was more like 12pm . Take more dehydrated food ( less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to towns ) , stop at more fishing camps and eat more dry fish ( yum ) . ? Take more photos ( battery life was a problem , possibly take a film camera as well as digital ) . More zoom would have been great , especially for birds ! ? Colour photocopy maps in a university library . Mine were laminated - they all got wet - so maybe try a map holder . You could scan them too ( or buy the software ) and paste them together in Fugawi or equivalent to get a smaller sized map of a more precise area ( cut out the areas you don-t need ) I used 1:250000 which were great . ? Pay close attention to your map once you turn off onto the east channel . If your not you-ll go the wrong way and it could get embarrassing - I met a guy who relied solely on his GPS to get to Inuvik and ended up getting lost .

The Bud car goes from Sudbury to White River on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday . From White River to Sudbury on Wednesday , Friday and Sunday . You have to plan your trip around this time frame . <p> We only saw one other canoeist , but saw a fair number of motor boats as both lakes have road access . There also are lodges on both lakes . There are lots of campsites spread over the whole area and were easy to find . We saw otters , beavers , bald and golden eagles , turkey vultures and a bear . <p> The area is semi-remote and the lakes are fairly large , a topographical map is needed for navigation . The route is easy , with only the one 70m portage , with good fishing and lots of campsites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park . <p> A good flat water trip for anyone that does n't  like to portage much and still paddle an almost cottage free area . 134054 @qwx994054 <p> Saturday Aug 19 , 2000 <p> We started in Sudbury taking the train to the northeast arm of Ramsey Lake , 3km before Ramsey . <p> The conductors on the Bud car were very friendly and after looking at the topo map knew where to let us off the train . Prices for the train in 2000 where $38.00 per person return and $38.00 per canoe return . Well worth the price because although you can drive to Ramsey and Biscotasing the road is rough and you have to find someone to shuttle a vehicle . The train ride is an adventure in itself . We booked our tickets 7 days in advance to get the best rate , you do it through Via rail . It is the Sudbury to White River train . Also it is cheaper to buy return from Ramsey than to buy tickets to Ramsey and return from Biscotasing . <p> We loaded our gear on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to technical difficulties the train left two hours late . Arrived at the northeast arm of Ramsey Lake at 3:30 p.m. , a lonely stretch of track , nothing in sight . After sorting our gear we pushed off . Two hours later we found an island campsite to stay for the night . The site had nice tent pads and a clean fire pit but there was a lot of garbage left at the site . It looked like it was a fishing or hunting campsite for parts of the year . <p> Canoed 9.5 km Saturday <p> Sunday Aug 20 , 2000 <p> Left our site at 10:00 the next morning no wind and a beautiful sunny day . Canoed for a couple hours and stopped for lunch at a nice island campsite . Saw a golden eagle that morning and watched it catch a thermal and become a speck in the sky . After lunch we canoed a couple more hours , past Cat Bay till we found yet another island campsite . This site was spotless and very pretty with the fire pit over-looking the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Monday Aug 21 2000 <p> A day to relax , fish , swim and , read . Caught a good meal of walleye for the six of us off the west side of the island . <p> Tuesday Aug 22 2000 <p> Packed our gear and on the water at 10:00 am . Canoed south through Ramsey Lake to the dam between Ramsey Lake and Biscotasi Lake . Portaged right around the dam 70m . Canoed through to Boyuk Bay and set up camp on the west shore just before the narrows . A nice big site that sees a lot of use , it had a great western view . Caught a few more walleye for supper . While I was fishing I saw something swimming in the water just east of our camp . Calling to the others they took a look , it was a black bear . It must have smelled us as we where downwind and swam to the other side of the channel to avoid us . <p> Canoed 11 km <p> We 'd Aug 23 , 2000 <p> On the water again at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the train at 4:30 p.m .. Saw a Bald eagle perched on a dead tree . Stopped for a late lunch and to freshen up about a km from Biscotasing on an island . Arrived at Biscotasing at 3:30 .

The bridge is unmarked , but is the first real bridge you come to heading south from Highway 17 . Proceed east ( upstream ) to twin falls island . There are two portages here , island center , and on the right side , close to the small rapids . I prefer the center portage , about 150 meters . This is a well used camp site area . <p> Proceed south on river to north end of Pekagoning Lake . <p> East across north end of lake , then north on Turtle River to rapids by high cliffs . <p> There are numerous campsite locations along the river . <p> Portage 330 meters right , proceed north past two islands on east side of river . <p> Portage 600 meters east to Smirch Lake . This portage has some rugged sections on it , and I classify it as the hardest on this trip . In high water there will be about 50 meters of the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southeast on Smirch Lake . There is an excellent campsite on the large island in the middle of the lake . Also a small one in the narrows at the end of the lake . <p> Proceed to Dibble Falls . There is an old log chute constructed here . You will notice by now that the water is becoming much clearer than at the beginning . This will continue till White Otter Lake , which is very clear . Portage is on the left , you will have two choices , up across the rocks at the edge of fast water , about 50 meters , or on the established trail further to the left , about 150 meters . <p> Proceed south to Dibble Lake , then east , northeast , then south to the end of lake . <p> Very nice campsite on the sand beaches on the east side of lake . <p> Portage 400 meters south to Un-named Lake . Very nice campsite to the right of portage end . <p> Proceed east to rapids , portage 530 meters left to White Otter Lake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Just before rounding the southern tip of the arm of land on your left , there is an exceptional campsite on a beautiful sand beach . Just to the north of the castle are numerous lovely campsites among huge red and white pines . There are 2 alternate side trips to take on the return trip . #1 . <p> Follow east shore of White Otter north to creek , portage to Nora Lake , portage to pothole lake , portage to Patricia Lake . This portage can be extremely muddy in wet weather , as the portage trail follows a snowmobile trail through a swamp . <p> The original portage trail bypasses this stretch , but is not always cleared of deadfalls . All these portages and lengths are shown on the White Otter Provincial Park map . <p> Proceed to the extreme west side of Patricia Lake . Note : the canoe route to Ignace exits on north shore of lake . This route now takes you off of the park map . Boats are usually by the portage on the west side . <p> Portage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail is rather rough . <p> Proceed west , southwest across Dimple , past cabins at narrows , to northwest side of puddle . Clear , winding , fast flowing creek into Dibble Lake . Lots of fun , excellent swift water experience for novices to learn how to navigate narrow , winding waterways in swift water . Creek is navigable , except in very low water levels . Adds one extra day to return trip . <p> Alternate #2 . Follow Turtle River north out of Smirch Lake , instead of doing the 600 meter portage . This route takes you north into Bending Lake , then back south again to rejoin previous route . <p> This takes about an extra 6 hours and 9 sets of rapids and fast water . All the rapids are shootable with basic white water skills . The worst one ( second one you come to ) has a 50 meter portage on the right side . I would class this as a class two , non technical rapids . Straight through , no turns or ferrys required . Gets rougher in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novices to run several times to build their confidence . <p> There is a really nice campsite on Bending Lake , on the north side of long sand point at the east side of treed section . 134045 @qwx994045 <p> Our family takes a canoe trip just about every summer , and this is one of our favorites . We have done this trip 3 times , sometimes stretching it out to 12 or 13 days . <p> Walter Hochstetler 134054 @qwx994054 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @qwx994055 <p> I thought I 'd just put down a few of my thoughts and comments on this trip , with a little option to remove some of the back-tracking on the loop . I did a solo trip using a modified version of this loop in July 2005 , and plan to do it again with company . Like the previous comment suggests , the 2005 water levels were high , and this made some aspects of the trip slightly easier while making the rapids into Bending Lake slightly more robust . During my 6 day trip , I came across one group of Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorized boats ( both on Pekagoning Lake on Day 1 and Day 6 ) , so I found the traffic to be light given its ease of access . This area is used frequently by the Scouts , and sees its fair share of motorized use as well . You will come across numerous boat-caches , but if you can make the trip off the popular weekends , you could hope to see few people using them . Paddling with motorized boats is simply the trade-off that you make for a very easily accessed area where boats are not prohibited . My suggestion to alter the route has the benefit of eliminating some of the back tracking , but also comes with cautions . The route is less traveled , and portages are less clear . Low water levels could also make for some hard travelling . Simply , the route uses Kenoshay to access the far west side of Dibble , rather than using the Turtle River and Smirch . This makes only the initial portions of the Turtle and the upper reaches of Dibble as re-paddled water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ) river that heads east into Kenoshay Lake off the Turtle . This will take you through several short portages ( some over potentially ankle-twisting old boulder river beds ) and a couple of small shallow ponds . At points the creek becomes just wide enough to fit a canoe and a paddle . While the high water levels during my trip allowed me to line the canoe up one point , drier conditions will make an extra portage necessary . Heading south , then east through the L-shape of Kenoshay will take you to a short portage into the southwest end of Dibble Lake . There is an outpost cabin and a camping site on the north shore of Kenoshay not too far from the portage . The portage is easy to find , but traverses a bedrock knob , and starts off with only a little room to manoeuvre between the lake and bedrock wall . Once into Dibble , you can continue the route as well described by Walter .

The canoe/portage distance is the same as the 622 route within 500m or so . Ignace is the closest community to White Otter Lake and the Castle . There are a few more portages this way ( 15 one way ) but many people prefer this route because it begins right in town on Agimak Lake . Also this route is the one traveled by James McQuat , the man who built the White Otter Castle , when he needed supplies . If you wish to turn this into fishing/camping trip the lakes in Turtle river park are full of Lake Trout , Walleye , and Northern Pike . The best way to fish is by extending your canoe trip a few days and camping near the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend only canoe trip to White Otter Lake the closest access is off Moosehide road into Devil 's Gap Lake .

@@107413035 @2813035/ 134052 @qwx994052 134053 @qwx994053 <h> Nova Craft Prospector 16 <p> Originally designed by the Chestnut Canoe Co. back in 1910 , the Prospector has to be the greatest wilderness tripping design of all time . Reproducing this famous canoe we have been faithful to the original design . The Prospector has good sharp entry lines for speed but the ends flare out quickly to float the bow over waves . The canoe is stable , but sensitive to leans for carving turns whether paddling tandem or solo . The moderate rocker in the keel line allows quick pivoting and sideslipping in rapids . If your canoeing adventures include a mix of lakes , rivers , whitewater rapids , and wilderness trips , there is no better canoe for you than the Prospector <p> I 've had my 16 ' Prospector ( Kevlar/cap layup ) since 1987 . Beautiful , fine-lined boat that paddles well in lakes or easy class 3 . A thing of beauty that is a dream to paddle , especially in the leaned position , a la Bill Mason . <p> I have used this NC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in various solo and tandem conditions , from river travel , C1 to C4 rapids , to lakes , to many portages , and I can honestly say it is a great Prospector canoe . I have travelled on the Gatineau , the Petawawa , and the Jacques-Catier , for example and I truly enjoy this canoe . After all these years of abuse it looks " bad " however I do not let these " cosmetic " aspects fool anyone or myself , it is a great performer and this is why I purchased this NC in the first place . Peroid ! <p> 16 ' prospector in kevalar/spectra . Got it in 94 , a lot of water under both of us since.Great all round canoe , flat bottom no keel , does everything I want it to do.I paddle it , portage it and sleep under it , its my swiss army knife of canoes . <p> Got the RLite version but in 15 ' . I am impressed by the weight , pretty light for a RLite boat , actually is comparable to my friend 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very stable and you can control it nicely in significant wind . The thing I am not sure about is the durability aspect of the material . This is my first RLite boat . We hit some minor rocks , some really insignificant stuff . The boat received major dents and scratches , it seems as the material is as soft as butter . So I am not sure how the boat will hold up in the long run . I 'd say 10 for handling , definietely handles better than other prospector boats I paddled , 7 for quality/ durability . .. oh and VERY comfortable nylon laced seats . Kaliber <p> I bought my Nova Craft Prospector in May of 2005 and to this point , according to my log book have about 338 kilometers on her . I have paddled lots of other canoes but fell in love with this one . Simply put it is like the Jeep of the canoe world , agile , maneuverable , and able to go anywhere it is pointed . Like the 4X4 Jeep it 's not a speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tandem it is a dream to paddle with a load of gear and it still has room for the dog to relax . Even fully loaded it remains responsive and sideslips with ease . Solo it becomes like ballet dancer turning on a dime with change to spare . You would n't expect that from a large canoe but with one good box stroke I can spin the nose around well past 180 degrees from where I started and with the second stroke can be powering in the opposite direction to what I was traveling two seconds ago . Leaned over hard and paddling Canadian style will bring much of the volume out of the water increasing ease of paddling and handling even more . The weight is not so much of an issue to me . At 85lbs it is about half my body weight but learning how to pick a canoe up solo properly and building that muscle memory is the important part . Without learning how to roll a canoe up onto your shoulders properly even lighter canoes are a pain to handle . Once you learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least until at end of the first kilometer of portaging ! Also the Nova Craft stock yoke is a deep dish made of ash and is quite comfortable unpadded in comparison to anything else I have seen . Some people do not like the rope carry handles on the ends , and I have to agree , but after the first week I stopped noticing them . I always carry my canoe solo on my shoulders , it is just so much easier to be self reliant , so I only use the end ropes to tie the nose and tail down when on the car . This canoe is tough too , and will take a beating and still work like a million bucks . I have seen older Nova Craft Prospectors that looked like they had been through a war or something , but they were still graceful and dignified on the lake , even after taking on the arduous white water . This may be the best all around canoe in the world today coming in three different lay ups to suit individual needs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have returned my questions the same day they I e-mailed them and even sent me replacement decals free of charge when they came off on a trip . This combined with a lifetime guarantee on their product has won my loyalty . I would rate this canoe a 9.5/10 as is and if I could afford a custom build , to add a few minor changes I would give it a full 10/10 . If you can only afford one canoe and you want it to do everything and last a life time , buy the Nova Craft Prospector . <p> I bought this used rental canoe in 1992 . It was in a rental condition when I bought it and I beaten this beast like I was renting it too . Surprised it still floats and it does that very well . Ca n't say enough good things about the Prospector design and the 17 ' has been a saviour for long trips with its extra capacity ( 1200 pounds ) . I found this 17 ' model to not paddle to its full potential until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course ) . In fact , I found it to be best with about 600-700 pounds . I would have rated this canoe higher at an 8 but there have been some aging issues beyond its poor treatment by its owner : ) When contacting Nova Craft they encouraged me to bring it in for some renovations . I drove 4 hours to London to find the staff rude and they ended up quoting me more then double the market price for the repair knowing that they had me hooked after driving so far ! This was also after they quoted me a far lesser amount over the phone . They rationalized their price increase because of some nominal extra work they would have to do . Apparently they work for no less then $200/hour . And this was in November in the off-season . Overall I 'd day this is a good canoe but has some minor to moderate aging issues and the manufacturer will not back you up if something goes wrong . <p> Had this canoe a few months now . I have the royalex hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's what I bought it for . Compared to my 17 ' OT Tripper it is slower and tracks less straight for flat water but more agile in rapids . NC Prospector is a great all round canoe if any rapids are to be run , paddles well solo with the canoe reversed . <p> We bought our 16 ft. fiberglass prospector at the fall sale in Sept. 2003 . It was sold as a factory second with a small blemish in the gel coat.Since May , 2004 we 've been on lakes , rivers , and creeks all over Southern Ontario.We have learned the capabilities and limitations of this canoe and it has taken a lot of punishment on rocks and gravel.It tracks well , turns and side slips easily . The carrying capacity is phenomenal.To sum it up , the Nova Craft Prospector is a great canoe . <p> The beauty of Royalex knows no bounds . I acquired this boat after it fell off a canoe trailer , at 100 kph , and onto pavement . Fixed ' er up , and have n't looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many river and lake miles . Nova Craft builds a great product , and this is a design that can not be beat ! <p> I love my prospector canoe . We have taken it on the Chapleau , Spanish and Missinabi among others and have found it very responsive in running water . C1 to C3 rapids pose no challenge for the prospector . It carries a good load for 2 adults . The weight is a draw back on long portgages but the performance on the water maker certainly compensates . <p> We bought the royalex prospector from Nova Craft and have been very happy in it 's first year . The boat tracks reasonable well for the amount of rocker and lack of a keel . It is n't the fastest boat , but once it hits whitewater it is in it 's element . The rocker and flair mean we stay drier than our old canoe ( Scott Tripper ) and eddy turns , surfs and ferries are all easier in this canoe . We bought it with skid plates ( good idea ) , bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U Shaped Knee pads ( I love em , my wife does n't - no place to put her feet ) . Our only problem was that the deep dish yoke developed a crack - Nova Craft shipped a new one free of charge that arrived 2 days later . We 've only paddled in up to easy C3 so far , I 'm anxious to see how we do in the tough C3s ... Before we bought I paddled several other boats , including a weekend on the Madawaska with the new Langford prospector and the Swift Dumoine . In order , I 'd rank the Nova Craft 1st , Lang 2nd and I did n't like how much water the Swift took on going over any drop and it finished dead last ( even lower than the Scott Tripper ) .

It is from this lake that I began a four day solo canoe trip that took me over portages , through rapids and around waterfalls . 134054 @qwx994054 <p> Day 1 June 12 , 2006 <p> On Monday June 12 around 10:45am I began my trip at Modsley Lake . The access point can be reached by traveling down the ATV trail that runs between McAdam and Canterbury for about half a kilometer ( 19 T 632599 5055064 ) . For this trip I used a 16 foot fiberglass Chestnut canoe and a home made paddle . I brought with me the usual camping gear along with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to record my adventure . <p> Some of the inclement weather from the previous weekend lingered resulting in overcast skies and blustering winds . My plan was to paddle along the northern shore of the lake and then skirt over to the outlet once I reached the far end . However , as I got ten feet away from the access point the wind caught my canoe sent me towards the southern shore . I did n't  struggle against the wind too hard as I still had four days of paddling ahead of me . I ended up near the mouth of the Colter Stream on the southern side of the lake . From here I paddled along the southern shore taking pictures of the beaver lodges along the way . <p> Approximately three quarters of the way down the lake I spotted a small dilapidated cottage on an unnamed little island . Upon closer inspection , the cottage appeared to be well tended as the window frames were all painted red and the woodshed was full of firewood . There was a cardboard sign in the woodshed that said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what kind of parties took take place on this island as I explored further . I signed the guestbook in the cottage and continued on my way . <p> Before I could enter the outlet leading to Third Lake , I had to paddle around a peninsula that juts out into the lake . As I ventured into the mouth of the outlet the rise of the opposite shore afforded some protection against the wind . The outlet of Modsley Lake is a long , narrow deadwater dotted with rotting stumps and bleached boulders . At its entrance there is a large alder-choked swamp area to the right . This looked like prime moose country but none were around to be seen . <p> At the end of the outlet there is a boomerang shaped body of water called Third Lake . The outer corner of the boomerang is a swamp choked with alders and rotting cedar trees . By following the curve of Third Lake my course took me increasingly to the right until I had completed an almost 180 degree change in direction . At the other end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadway running along its top and a small sluiceway that let 's the water drain out into a stream that eventually empties into Wauklahegan Lake . My topo map indicated that this is the beginning of the Diggity Stream . The vertical drop through the sluiceway was over 10 feet which ruled out any possibility of taking the canoe through . Thus I was about to experience my first portage of the trip . <p> I had no idea where to find the portage as I had never traveled this way before . I walked up onto the roadway , turned left and immediately almost tripped over a snapping turtle laying eggs along the edge of the road . Once the turtle had run me off I resumed my search and found the portage a few metres to the right of the sluiceway . It is a trail through the woods that leads to a small deadwater further down the Diggity Stream . The portage was in pretty good shape with a minimum of undergrowth and only one blowdown to negotiate . I put the canoe on my shoulders and traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going until I reached the far end where I had to negotiate some large rocks and a few boggy patches . <p> Once I got back into the water I paddled across a short deadwater to the top of another small rip . According to my map I had arrived at the Winding Stairs Rips . There is a 30m portage to the right for those more cautious canoeists . Since the water was high I decided to run the rips . After traveling down the Staircase without incident , I found myself in Wauklahegan Lake . <p> I traveled along a peninsula , turned right and headed for the outlet that leads to First Lake . For a short while the wind was actually at my back . This changed as I rounded the peninsula . At the point where the outlet exits Wauklahegan Lake there is an old rock dam . Because of the heavy rains of the previous weekend the water level in the lake was unusually high with water pouring over the entire length of the dam . The water was so high in fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canoe into the channel at the left side of the dam and ran the 300m length of the newly created rapids . Running this short stretch was analogous to running Burnt Hill or Little Falls on the St. Croix . Luckily there were few rocks so I arrived at First Lake unscathed . <p> First Lake is just a large pond that forms part of the Diggity Stream . While I was paddling across this small lake the wind came back up and blew steadily in my face . At the other end of First Lake there is a bridge that allows Route 630 to cross the Diggity Stream . Because of the high water there was less than two feet of clearance beneath the bridge . I managed to clear the bridge by lying on the bottom of the canoe as it passed underneath . <p> Once past the bridge I was in another swampy deadwater that empties into Spednic Lakes Diggity Cove . It was at this juncture that I found my campground for the night . I pitched camp at a spot known as the Diggity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site had been a gathering place for native hunting parties for almost 2000 years . It was a nice grassy sight with a good supply of sawn firewood and a nice view of the sunset over Spednic Lake . <p> After setting up camp I cooked myself a steak and watched the loons drift across Diggity Cove . As it began to get dark I crawled into my tent and went to sleep to the sounds of the bullfrogs serenading each other . Thus ended the first day of my trip . Up until this point I had not seen another soul . <p> Day 2 June 13 , 2006 <p> I woke up around 7am and was on the water before 8 . The sun was out and there was a light breeze . I was thankful for the lack of wind as I had been warned that the wind on Spednic can be quite treacherous . With the help of my GPS I paddled out of Diggity Cove and headed towards Todds Island . I wanted to check out the campsite there for future reference . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fisherman packing up camp . Apparently they had been there since Saturday and had caught a few smallmouth bass . They told me that it had rained quite hard over the weekend and they had a hard time staying dry . <p> After I rounded the tip of Todds Island the wind picked up a little . I paddled past the Musquash Flowage and over to Hardwood Island . I caught a break from the wind as I paddled along the backside of Hardwood Island . It was while paddling the open expanse of water between Todds and Hardwood Islands that I realized how large this lake really is . There was a lot of water all around me . <p> After I rounded Hardwood Island I paddled towards Sandy Point and followed the western shoreline of the peninsula . After about an hour I reached a campsite called " The Ledges " . The entire campsite is built on outcroppings of bedrock . It was an attractive campsite but I could n't help wondering how you would anchor your tent on all of that rock . I guess you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use rocks to anchor the corner of your tents . <p> Since the sun was out I decided to have lunch at The Ledges and take a swim . The water was a bit cold but it was refreshing and it was nice to wash off the sweat and Muskol . As I was drying off I spotted a motorboat traveling along the American side of the lake . This was the first boat I had seen since I began my trip . <p> After drying off I loaded the canoe and continued my journey . I followed the shoreline on the Canadian side of the lake as I rounded Norway Point and continued up Spednic Lake . After a few hours I arrived at a campsite at the mouth of MacAllister Cove . Appropriately enough the name of this campsite was " MacAllister Cove " . However , there was another old , faded signed nailed to a tree that said " Joes Backside " . Perhaps this was the original name of this campsite . Directly across from this spot is and island called " Joes Island " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its name . The MacAllister Cove/Joes Backside campsite is located in a flat spot in the woods . Like all the " official " campsites it had a picnic table , a fire pit , a small supply of firewood and a privy out in the woods . I pitched my tent , had some supper and enjoyed the sunset over MacAllister Cove . Since I had no one to sit around the fire with and it had been a long day of paddling , I was asleep shortly after nine oclock . <p> Day 3 June 14 , 2006 <p> I woke up around 6:45am and was on the water around 7:30 . The sky was overcast and as there was no wind the lake was as smooth as glass . Just as I was launching my canoe the heavens opened up and it poured rain for about half an hour . This was the only rain I had for the entire trip . I was a bit lucky because if it had started raining a little earlier I would have been caught with all my gear unpacked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned on this trip is that the first thing up and the last thing down is the rain tarp . <p> Once I passed Joes Island and rounded Hinckley Point the rain began to subside and eventually stopped . I followed the shore along the Canadian side and saw no other boaters . I did pass a couple of outfitters lodges and spotted a few cottages on the American side . As I got closer to the upper end of Spednic the density of cottages on the American side increased . <p> This part of the lake is quite narrow and it resembles a river more than a lake . For the rest of the morning I paddled up this thin stretch of Spednic until I arrived at Pontiac Island . From Pontiac Island I paddled into the Booming Grounds and up into the stream that drains Mud Lake . <p> Just before noon I found the portage ( river right , Canadian side ) that would take me around Mud Falls and into Mud Lake . I picked up one of my packs and started off on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path through the woods until it hits a logging road . At this point the trail follows the road up the hill until you hit another woods trail that leads to the upper end of the portage . The portage is approximately 300m long and appeared to be well used and maintained . The upper end opens up literally right beside the mouth of Mud Falls . <p> When I returned to the beginning of the portage to collect the rest of my gear I found 3 guys in a canoe at the mouth of the stream . They were fishing but had n't  had any luck as of yet . <p> I carried my canoe and remaining gear over the portage and left it on the shores of Mud Lake . I then went down through the woods to get a few pictures of Mud Falls . In order to get a good view of Mud Falls you need to climb onto these large boulders that line the bank of the stream . The gorge is quite steep and the falls itself must drop a good fifteen to twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to run this gorge in a canoe . If you were brave enough you might make it through in a whitewater kayak . <p> After a quick half hour paddle down the length of Mud Lake I found myself at the bottom of the stream that drains East Grand Lake into Mud Lake . To the right of the stream there is a road that leads up through Forest City and ends up at a small boat launch to the right of the dam . However , the length of this portage would be close to a kilometer and I was n't really in the mood to haul my canoe that distance . So instead of portaging I lined my canoe up the stream . There was a lot of water in the stream but I managed to make it up to the dam in about 40 minutes . After a quick lift over the dam I was ready to begin my exploration of East Grand Lake . <p> At about 1:30 I rounded Patterson Point and headed out into the expanse of Grand Lake . The sun had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see many more boats and I noticed there were more cottages . I paddled along the shore on the Canadian side and eventually arrived at Hayes Point in the early evening . <p> The campsite at Hayes Point is located at the tip of a large peninsula that juts out into the lake . It is a beautiful site that affords a 270 degree view of the lake . I set up camp and settled in for the evening . I was asleep before 10pm . <p> Day 4 June 15 , 2006 <p> I woke up at 6am to a foggy and windy morning . The fog was so thick that I could barely see ten feet out into the lake in any direction . It was also very windy but apparently not enough to blow away the fog . I broke camp and started paddling across Big English Cove around 7am . After an hour of tough paddling I reached the far shore of the cove . By this time the fog was starting to lift and the wind was slackening . <p> I paddled up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campsite at Blueberry Point . As I reached Blueberry Point a crew from the International Waterway Commission pulled up in a large motorboat . They told me that they were preparing the campsites on the lake for the upcoming summer season . <p> After discussing the conditions on the lake for a few moments I continued on my way . After an hour or so of paddling I reached the North Lake thoroughfare and pulled up at the boat launch located directly across from the Canada Customs House . I walked up to the phone booth beside the Customs House and called for my ride . As I was returning to my boat a Customs Officer asked me where I had just come from . I showed her my I 'd and explained my itinerary . <p> A few minutes later my ride showed up and my trip came to its official end . It took me almost 97 hours to travel the distance from Modsley to North Lake . All in all it was an enjoyable trip with no major mishaps . I look forward to trying this trip again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for a longer flat water trip I would recommend this route . This route could be followed anytime throughout the summer and would be a great choice when the water levels in the rivers are too low to run . <p> Thomas Neal 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @qwx994055 <p> The camp " brokeback " is actually owned by The 1st Mcadam Venturers , a boy scout group in Mcadam .

@@107413040 @2813040/ 134053 @qwx994053 <h> Installing a Bow Line <p> I have recently purchased a Royalex canoe . It seems all of the most of the manufacturers do not provide an adequate place to tie off a bow/stern line . I have come up with a cheap and tough solution . <p> I drilled an 13/16 " ( 3/4 " is better ) hole in the stems , up high , this hole allowed me to thread in a 1/2 " PVC male threaded adapter. ( check all your sizes before drilling any holes. ! ) I then trimmed the threads to size , then put epoxy on threads and on the sides of the hole . Then I threaded the adapter into the hole . <p> Now this gives you a nice size hole , that is flush to the sides of the canoe and I fished 1/2 " line through the hole , tied a knot on the inside . This knot then jams into the adapter giving you a secure place to tie on a bow/stern line . I have seen where people just drill a hole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the epoxy will keep that from being an issue . I recommend cutting the threads close to size , then use a Dremel type tool to grind it flush after epoxy sets . <p> Total cost $5.00 US .

The scenery is of coulees , cottonwood groves , coloured clay cliffs , and sandstone walls . There are many islands and sandy or gravelly bars and beaches . Good viewing of pelicans , hawks , deer , ducks , coyotes , and prairie wildflowers. 134054 @qwx994054 <p> Darin &amp; Jennifer Zandee July 2001 As we put in at the campground on the west side of Hwy 2 , we could see that at 150m3/s there was going to be many shallow riffles to watch for . It was a hot , sunny , prairie summer day in July . At 36*C with no wind , I looked forward to those secluded sandbars where we could skinny-dip and rest on the soft sand . A kilometre downstream from the Hwy 2 bridge there were chunks of broken up concrete lurking just beneath the surface waiting to slice through inattentively paddled canoes . We stayed left to avoid these jagged slabs . We glided along at 8kph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cows stared , chewing their cuds , as " Eddy " our green Royalex Wenonah canoe , drifted past . At 13kms Willow Creek entered on the left and the river split , the left channel makes a 160* turn before passing along a 30m high purplish clay bank . We stayed right and when the two channels met we could see how a canoe could flip if you did n't  stay right . At 35km there is a ledge on the left with a little surfing wave and 3kms before the Old Hwy 3 bridge the rock gardens were fairly shallow . A kilometre below the Hwy 3 bridge the river bent left along a 50m high cliff and at the end of this the wall stuck into the river creating some whirlpools . At 62 km there were some waves along a bank that we took once when the flow of 650m3/s created 4 ft standing waves , which was a ton of fun . On the left a person can eddy out below these waves and line back up stream to ride this roller coaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river as well has some hawks and at 83km there is a heron colony on the right downstream of a large island . As we floated past Popson Park we reflected on the time we took the kids down this section of river on June 16 ( flow 800m3/s ) 2 days after it flooded at 1600m3/s . The silt hissed on the bottom of the canoe . Nowhere could you eddy out as the water was into the willows and trees . Not to mention the mud was so deep and soft you would not want to step out anyway . There were lots of weird currents and boils and the bridge pylons were thick with logjams and whirlpools . Justin ( 11yrs old ) remarked that is probably why the city had posted the large red signs " AREA CLOSED Due to High Water " at all the river access points .

That was the plan , but plans change . Our objective was to paddle the L+chelle Loop in Quebecs ZEC Kipawa . A ZEC ( in French " Zone d'Exploitation Contr ( lTe " ) is a " Controlled Harvesting Zone " . We Pennsylvanians could understand them to be basically Quebecs version of our Pennsylvania Game Lands , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes , but in order of unofficial priority they tend to cater to logging , hunting , fishing and then canoe camping ( almost no trail maintainence ) . The L+chelle Loop looked very interesting on their website . The bulk of it is remote and involves passage on narrow lakes . We had paddled the southwest portion of it on a previous trip and found it very nice . My main concern before starting the trip was lack of information about the route , especially campsite locations . The parks website showed too few for my concern and gave no details of their conditions . I turned to the internet forums and posted inquiries . Although I did get several responses , all said the last time they traveled that loop was 15-20 years ago . A couple of responders gave me good advice on several unlisted campsite locations and conditions . I was told most sites were small and could only hold two tents at best . However , all the responders agreed the loop was worth travelling . It promised beautiful scenery and plenty of wildlife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out from Marys Central PA home at 5:00AM Thursday morning ( 18 Aug ) . After a long , but pleasant , drive we arrived in Temiscaming , Quebec at 6:00PM . We checked in to the Arberge Canadienne Motel , had dinner in their restaurant and took a short hike up the lookout trail overlooking the town . A 32 km early morning ride on the well maintained Chemin Maniwaki logging road put us at the Grindstone Lake put-in at 9:30AM . At that point we had to make a decision . Do we travel the route clockwise or counter-clockwise ? Previous experience and a lengthy review of the internets average wind patterns for the area made us decide on counter-clockwise . That decision would very well prove to be the right one for us later . The public put-in at Le Camp-Quatre is at the southeast section of the loop , so we set out north on the eastern portion . Before starting we spoke with Marie LaBranche at nearby Depot Mongo . She and many of her family spend their summers at cabins facing a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a past trip . They gave us lots of advice on the lower portion of the route and were proud to show us their new houseboats they had started to rent last year . If you want to see the beautiful Kipawa lakes region in a less strenuous manner you should seriously consider their houseboat option ( www.kipawahouseboat.com ) . They are essentially upscale RVs on the water . An easy 3 km paddle took us to the first portage , but along the way we flushed a bald eagle out of a tree at near water level and only 10 yards away . This was the first of many wildlife sightings . The 40 meter portage was an easy carry that put us on Lac Desquerac and we passed a good looking campsite on a point on the left as we proceeded to Lac McLachlin . Chute-Du-Pin-Rouge was supposed to be a portage around a bridge , but it appears the bridge had been rebuilt and the channel opened for easy passage . Narrow passages on Rivierre and Ruisseau Birch , one more short portage and 18km of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campsite . There were several beaches that could hold tents ( on a slant ) , but the ZEC map showed one on a large island in the middle of the lake . Twenty minutes of searching found it to actually be on a narrow peninsula just east of the island . It was small and showed very few signs of use . We made dinner at the campsite , but set up our tents on its beach . After doing so , we discovered a much better level beach site at the north end of the peninsula . Saturday mornings paddle up the north end of Lac McKillop started with extremely calm water . Shortly after pushing off we spotted something swimming across the lake several hundred meters ahead of us . At first we thought it was probably a beaver , but it appeared to be too long . We discounted the possibility it was an otter , because they simply do n't  swim in a straight line for very long as this was doing . At some point it turned its head to look at us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It doubled its speed upon seeing us and the race was on . We managed to get to it when it was about 30 meters from shore and only had time to take a couple of close up photos before and as it left the lake . What we originally thought was a bobcat turned out to be a once in a lifetime up close sighting of a Canadian Lynx . What a thrill ! Nine kilometers of paddling up more narrow passages and the length of Lac Pants brought us to a 360 meter easy carry to a higher narrow boggy lake . The reward for this portage was lunch and the observation of a picturesque waterfall . Another easy 100 meter portage put us on Lac A L+chelle . Lac A L+chelle sits at the high ground of this route and suffers the consequences of not having much water feeding it . Without enough runoff out of the lake it has inadequate circulation and is heavily affected by acid rain . It is a " Windex " lake with very clear lightly tinted blue-green water and nothing much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stunningly beautiful and surrounded by many majestic old growth red and white pine . Our intent was to go north out of the west side of the lake on through series of large ponds and a small stream that was supposed to connect us with Lac A La Truite . But that is where our original plan fell apart . First of all it was readily apparent that being on the high ground in late summer had run us out of water , but more importantly the large pond we needed in order to proceed no longer existed . For many years it stood behind the ramparts of an enormous beaver dam that rose nearly 2 meters high and about 80 meters long . Unfortunately one end of the dam was built on a long sloping rock . Eventually the pond pressure became too great for the unsecured dam on the smooth rock . It appears the dam blew out not long ago in what must of have been a cataclysmic event . The rock was washed clean and there were two large pot holes directly below the break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry in the middle of a mucky marsh that extended as far as we could see . We opted to turn around , find a campsite on Lac A L+chelle and contemplate our options . Although there are no campsites marked on the ZEC map , we found a nice one on a high point between the two bays . We later found one behind a beach on the north east bay . The beach site definitely had not been used in the past year or two . The point site was in good shape , but also had not been used in quite a while either . We decided to spend two nights at that site , relax and explore the lake . Then we would take our time getting back to the car and make a run down to Algonquin Provincial Park . Larry had never been there and we knew he would enjoy a day or two on the Route 60 corridor exploring the campgrounds and museums . Saturday night was spent marveling at the night sky , the brilliant Milky Way , spotting satellites and counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 3 seconds ) . Sunday was another dark blue sky day with puffy white clouds . We spent the day exploring the lake . We spotted a curious mink that spent quite a while checking us out from the base of a tree . We looked in vain for moose , but we knew we were in the right place based upon the numerous hoof prints we saw in the sand . The highlight of the day was seeing a wolf trotting along a distant shore . It was too far away to get a photo of it , but the image is forever imprinted in our minds . Monday was spent leisurely making our way back the way we came . As the day went on we started to realize turning back was not such a bad idea . The wind was now blowing rather briskly out of the northwest and would have been directly in our faces if we had been able to continue our intended route , but now it was at our backs . Another thought occurred to us . Had we decided on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the high ground blockage more than halfway through the trip and the wind would have been against us for almost the entire trip ( especially on the larger lakes in the southwest portion of the route on our way back ) . We were happy with our situation . There was supposed to be a campsite on the west side of the bottom of Lac Pants , but we had not seen one on the way up . We concluded they must have meant the parking area at the end of a logging road was the intended location . It was a nice flat area and no one was at the cabin across the stream from it , so we set up camp and took a hike up the old logging road . It rained while we were eating dinner , but we were rewarded with one of the most brilliant double rainbows we had ever seen . Tuesday started out a bit cloudy and the wind was stronger . As we broke out onto Lac McKillop we pulled out a mini tarp . We tied it to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake at speeds that sometimes gave us some concern . We sailed the length of the lake , passed our earlier campsite and continued on to cover 22km , a portage , one snack break and a long lunch in less than 6 hours , despite it raining part of the way . We took advantage of the campsite we saw earlier on Lac Desquerac . It was one of the nicest sites weve ever used . Its on an airy point with room for four tents , plenty of trees with space between them for tarps and a great swimming hole with multiple ledges to climb out and sit on . Unfortunately we did not get a chance to swim . A strong cool wind and rain persisted almost all day Wednesday . We spent the day relaxing under the tarp , reading , writing , telling stories and cooking up enjoyable meals . Although we did not get to do the entire route we wanted , the portion we did more than lived up to its reputation . The scenery was spectacular and the fact we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area is used and why there was some much wildlife to see . We left the Kipawa area behind us on Thursday morning and made our way down to Ontarios Algonquin Provincial Park . We entered the west gate of the park on Route 60 near Dwight , ON and found a nice campsite next to the lake at the Canisbay Campground . Once we were set up and had nice hot showers we learned there was a wolf howl originally scheduled for that evening , but it was cancelled due to weather conditions ( too windy ) . The park staff conducts these events several times each summer . They are incredibly well organized and often attended by several thousand people who somehow manage to stay quite enough while standing in the dark along a closed down Route 60 for the chance to hear wolves howling back from the distance to park staff that initiate the calls . We regretted missing the opportunity , but the staff still put on a great program at their outdoor theatre . We packed a lot of activities into Friday . Algonquin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the park . We participated in a walk through the woods while being informed of many interesting facts about mushrooms and fungi . Later we took a guided tour of the outdoor logging museum . We also walked the Spruce Bog Trail and visited the parks main museum and its art center . Both of which are well worth the trip to see . If you 've never been to Algonquin Park , put it on your list of places to spend a week . There is plenty to do while car camping along the Route 60 corridor and the massive area north of there has many canoe routes that beckon to be explored . If you are into outdoor adventure ( especially canoe camping or backpacking ) and are interested in the latest equipment available , then the outfitters at the west end of the park and along the way south ( near Gravenhurst , ON ) are good entertainment and a great temptation . We spent Saturday checking out all they had to offer as we made our way down past Toronto and to a friendly motel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in the past that it is much better to cross back into the U.S. through customs early in the morning . At 7:30AM you can drive right up to the customs booth . Any time later in the day and you risk the likelihood of having to wait several hours in bumper to bumper traffic . Its only a 5-6 hour ride from the Canadian border at Niagara to Central PA and we got home in plenty of time to unpack and even mow the lawn . I got an email from someone who did the entire loop later than us in August . He said the beaver dam was there back in 2009 and had a horrible time mucking his way through chest deep mud between Lac Devon and Lac L +chelle this year . I 've put a set of photos together in the Flickr website . LONG ... 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @qwx994055 <p> Thanks for posting my trip report .

However because of the low rain that year some of the outlets were very ... Muddy . Plus the Gong lake portage will happen on the second day so you are fully packed up for the week so it took 2 trips . So this portage can take a very long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and stuff . <p> Submitted by : Rick Pargeter on 0000-00-00 <p> I completed this route , solo , in mid August of 2004 . I decided on an August trip here for several reasons . Reasonably warm weather , past the peak of bug season , and water temperatures . You will be wading in water quite often . There is one piece of equipment that I feel I must recommend , and that is a pair of good water shoes not open toed sandals . I used a pair of Keen closed toed water shoes that were worth their weight in gold . I would like to prefice my log by stating that this is not a novice route . Your map reading skills , camping and canoeing techniques , and in some cases your tracking skills , all should be above average , or intermediate as some would say . You will find that as you read this description of the Ranger Lake Loop , I do not go into great detail as to length or location of portages . The exception here is when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descriptions of this route contained on this website or that which Kevin Callans book Ontarios Lost Canoe Routes describes . I will however try to put some perspective to what you can expect in terms of terrain , lake and river conditions , along with some traveling times that I encountered and the weather conditions under which they occurred . I would expect that you would take this persons account , along with other resources into consideration before undertaking this canoe trip There is public parking across the road from the public dock where Air Dale Flight services has their plane Day 1 Ranger Lake to Saymo Lake portage 2 hrs with 10k breeze at my back and a light rain . I portaged from the grassy slope to the left of the dock 240m along trial to Saymo Lake . Paddled through Saymo under heavy rain - 2 + hrs with 10k breeze at my back . The portage into Island Lake is 2.3k in length . Although it is along a road and cart track it was brutal with full provisions for the trip . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island Lake as mentioned in the previous route description . The cart trail I followed leads to the west side of Island Lake . This started as a one carry but ended up two . The rain did subside for this portage . Stayed on an island on Island Lake 308629E / 5212709N . The rain held off long enough to set camp at 3:30pm but did have to cook under the tarp , a common occurrence during this trip . Saymo to camp 2 + hrs . Day 2 The portage into Mystery Lake is a tough one . It follows a dry creek bed , is quite rocky and over grown with several downed trees to content with . Its the only portage where I have had to turn my canoe on its side to fit between trees . Definitely a two carry portage . Although I did not stay at the camp on Mystery Lake , I wish I had , it looked very interesting 307830E / 5214558N . One carry into Gong from Mystery along an easy trail . Travel time from camp to Gong 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back all the way trough Gong under sunny skies . The next two portages are easy one carry walks along easy trails , although the second has a slight incline and decline at beginning and end . The first and second beaver dam precedes and follows the second portage , along with a shallow section that will have to be waded just past the hydro line . If you have problems with these dams or the shallow section , turn back now ; there are many more challenges like this . Travel time from portage onto Gong to the confluence of the West Aubinadong and Nushatogaini , where I camped , 3 hrs 312184E / 5219809N Day 3 There is lots to deal with along the winding course of the West Aubinadong. 8 beaver dams , 3 log jams , and 6 portages . This number of portages varies somewhat from other accounts of this section of the river . The only explanation I can offer is that there were several sections that I lined the canoe upstream . There are also numerous spots where it is necessary to wade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hrs I made camp on Torrance Lake 309646E / 5232304N ( approximate ) Day 4 After lining the canoe into Megisan Lake and a short paddle it was time to succumb to the wind a quick day at 2 + hrs . I had a nice camp , completely sheltered from a continuous 40k wind 310161E / 5234815N . The lodge owner was in the process of bear baiting several locations around Megisan thankfully not in the area where I was forced to camp . Day 5 A nice calm paddle across Megisan to the first portage of the day . An easy one carry pass that a blind man could follow , what with all the orange surveyors ribbon hanging from trees every 30m . The portage from Clove to the unnamed lake was very difficult to follow . I had to two carry this one , just so I could see where the trail was . I had to really pay attention as the trial was very overgrown , and I actually went off the trail several times . Spectacular old growth pine and cedar throughout the bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also very easy and was completed in one pass . Travel time from my camp to Prairie Grass was 4 hrs . A short paddle down the Nushatogaini , lining one rapids and portaging one rapids put me into my camp for the night 318724E / 5233653N ( approximate , located at the rapids ) . I shared this camp with the only other canoers I saw throughout my entire trip , Glen and Rick . Travel time from entrance to Prairie Grass to camp was 3 + hrs . Day 6 More rain , very heavy at times . This section of the Nushatogaini provided lots of opportunities to hone my lining skills . There were three sections , one as long as a half kilometer , to contend with . There is also 10 12 beaver dams and several wade / drag the canoe sections . All this in the pouring rain . Finally had to make camp after only 4 hrs on the river 318315E / 5227324N Day 7 More beaver dams , 10 12 more . 15 log jams . Some are single logs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe had to be dragged up and over . Several , the canoe had to be dragged under logs and than over logs - quite challenging . Only one log jam did I have to portage around try not to step in the bear scat here . One short section of river had to be lined . Reached the confluence of the West Aubinadong and Nushatogaini in 7 + hrs . All in all a very nice river to paddle . Very scenic and peaceful . Paddled back to Gong Lake , doing both portages on the Gong Creek in one pass , in 2 + hrs set camp at 6:30 - 307243E / 5216043N . Day 8 Retraced my route back to Saymo paddling into a strong 10 15k headwind the entire time . After paddling 4 hrs I had to make camp for the day the wind wins again - 308312E / 5208924N . Spent the day drying gear . Everything was in good shape fro my return home , only to be awakened in the night to more rain . Day 9 It blew all night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . A very difficult paddle across Saymo with 12 18 inch waves - not quite white caps , but close and a steady downpour . Reached the south end of Saymo in 2 + hrs . Same conditions for the paddle across Ranger Lake . Finally reached the dock after paddling hard for another 4 + hrs . The entire paddle today was into 10 15k headwind and very choppy waters . <p> Submitted by : Doug Steenwyk on 2009-06-06 <p> I took this trip back in June of 1967 and August 1968 as a teenager with the YMCA Outposters . I can say I enjoyed the August trip more as the bugs were gone . I remember that this trip was not for the faint hearted.We spent 2 weeks getting in shape for the trip.Back then there was more interest in canoeing so more people made this trip . The portages were easy to find . The camp sites were cleaned up ( you did n't have to make your own ) . It still was n't easy but from what I read it 's a lot tougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better trout fishing . Back then ( and I hope today ) the Pike and Walleye had not invaded this corner of Ontario .

Falls are spectacula and can be swam in at the bottom . Campsite at top . b <p> Submitted by : John Kitchen on 2010-09-20 <p> Paddled this route September 9th to 15th 2010 . We did the abbreviated trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Domtar road . This trip was a very doable six day trip . The route has not been maintained . To us it looked like its been four to five years prior that anyone had used some of the campsites and portages . One of the best things we brought on this trip was a Gerber brush cutter . It came in real handy for clearing the overgrown campsites we encountered as well as for use along the portages and river landings . Both rivers have numerous beaver dams and log jams . Having a saw handy to cut through the odd log blocking the river would have been useful . Both rivers are exceedingly pretty . The Nushatogaini was particularly , as its narrower and more scenic . It was also the most difficult to navigate , given the numerous beaver dams and log jams . These were n't log jams made up of just one our two logs , these were jams where you took your packs out of the canoe , hauled the canoe up over a dozen logs , repacked the canoe , paddled fifeteen feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain saw , could make this route a lot easier to manage . All things said and done , for an experienced canoeist , this is a trip well worth taking . Lots of wildlife ( moose/beavers ) beautiful lakes , magnificant towering white pines , great fishing ( mind you we did n't have time to do alot ) and very scenic rivers . Do it . Note : water levels were adaquate . Lot of wading and linning of canoes down the Nushatogaini . Day one : Put in at Gong Lake . Travel from 12:30 to 4:30 pm . Cleared an over grown campsite on the West Aubinadong just before it narrows . Campsite on the right hand side of the river as you travel upstream . Day 2 : Paddled from 10:30 to 4:30 . Sunny day Camped on Torrance Lake . Day 3 : Paddled from 10:00 to 2:00 pm . Threaten rain all day . Found the portage out of Torrance to be on the right hand side . The portage out of Megisan was hard to find . The shoreline was over grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prtgage out of Clove Lake is an uphill climb for the first half . Camped on an island site on Prairie Grass lake . Day 4 ; Travelled from 10:30 to 4:30 . A day of sun rain sun rain . All river travel . The river starts out well . There is lots of wading and lining of canoes as you progress farther downstream . Saw a huge bull moose with the largest rack yet seen . Camped on the right hand side of the river before it narrows on the map . The campsite was an old hunting outpost up on the bank looking down the river . Day 5 : Hardest day yet . Traveled from 10:00 to 6:30 pm . Wading , lining , lift overs was the order of the day . It was still a fun day . The weather was once again wild . Rain , sun , rain , sun . Had trouble finding a campsite . Once again had to clear a old site . This site was located on the point , created by the confluence of the two rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . Traveled from 10:30 to 2:30 . Put a hole in our cedar strip on a rock . Once patched , did the portages and paddled to the car . Would have stayed a night on Gong Lake , but it was raining . Instead spent the night in Carolyn 's Motel in Thesselon . You can get showers at the Aubrey Falls Trading Post on #129 . <p> Submitted by : shiellb on 2010-09-25 <p> We were drier standing in the river than on land . . . it was raining that much .

Do n't  trust what anyone tells you ( including me ! ) and make up your own mind based on your ability . 134054 @qwx994054 <p> On Friday , March 29 , 2002 , Mike , Matt and I decided we wanted to check out the mighty Nith River . In fact , it was mostly me who decided and no one else seemed to complain . : ) I look at the river every time I drive over it near Phillipsburg , and had always wanted to paddle it . So this weekend I decided to do something about it . <p> The plan was to be on the water at around 10 , but for some reason I was up at 6:30am ( and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ... ) I put my canoe onto the car and was at Mikes place at 8:40 am . Mike couldnt find the keys to his van , so I left him to find them and took off for Matts place . I got to Matts at around 9 ( it may have been a little bit earlier ) and we loaded his paddles and stuff into my car . Mike showed up shortly ( turns out his dad had his van keys , so he had to find the spare set ) so we loaded Matts canoe onto the van and we were ready to go . It was grey and cool while we were packing up , so we hoped that the weather would get better . <p> We drove to where the Nith crosses Township Road 12 ( the first road South of Plattsville ) ( UTM 531200E , 4793250N Based on NAD 83 , Zone 17N ) and decided it looked like a good enough place to put in . Since we were doing a shuttle though , we kept driving straight on Township Road 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . There , we parked the car on the side of the road , took the canoe off of the top and tied it with the other canoe on top of Mikes van ( yay for huge vans ! ) . We threw all of our stuff into the van , turned around , and drove to our put in . <p> As we were getting the canoes off the van and our gear organized , we saw two other canoes come around the corner upstream of the road . They we going very slowly and we thought that they might be hunting ducks . We put in at 10:15 , which was 15 minutes behind schedule - but hey - its a long weekend who cares ! I was going to paddle solo for the first while , and we planned on switching up later . I had the new Nashwaak Paddles " Solo Strap " which I had n't  had a chance to try yet , so was happy to be trying it out . The water was plenty deep to paddle in almost all areas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I purposely went throught the shallow channel , I never got hung up anywhere . Matt and Mike got stuck only once I think , although they did scrape bottom more than the lighter solo boat , and had to choose their course more carefully . <p> Since this was my first time on the Nith ( and first for Matt and Mike too ) we had no clue what to expect , other than what I was told on the Canadian Canoe Routes forums . It turned out that it was a fanastic little river to paddle in the spring ! I 'm not sure why its not more popular , but I suppose that 's because its too dry in the summer . Anyway , the river goes through some open areas with fields on both sides ( mostly cow pasture , but some corn fields ) and then through some lightly wooded areas of mostly hardwoods . Further down towards the end of our little trip there was a swampier section which had cedar along the banks for a ways . The river bottom was often silty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rapids in the section we paddled were class one if you stretched it - I 'd just call them swifts ( at this water level anyway ) . We came across one ledge which we paddled , but scraped bottom . It would likely be tough on the boat if the water was any lower than it was when we did it . <p> For wildlife , we saw tons of ducks ( Mallards and some other kind we did n't  know with lots of white on the back of their wings ) , geese and killdeer . Final count of muskrat came out to 3 I think , but it may have been 4 , I forget . Lots of red-wing blackbirds also . As for people , the only paddlers were the two canoes we saw when we put in ( who we passed almost immediately ) . We also say a father and two kids skipping rocks , but that 's it . There are a few houses and camps visible from the river but most of the time its not too bad . We crossed under 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a trail ( looks interesting ... may have to check it out some day ... ) Because there are so many bridges , its easy to make the trip as long or as short as you want . The banks at the bridges are often steep and muddy , but still doable . Since most of the roads are quiet , I do n't  see a problem with just parking on the shoulder ( which is all we did ) . <p> The Grand River Conservation Authority has an excellent website which provides real time river conditions . The river flow at the time of this trip was approximately 6m3/s , while the average summer low flow is 2.6m3 /s . I had been told that the best time to paddle the river was when the flow is between 4 and 6 times the summer low flow . Obviously it was lower than that when we did it , so at least for this stretch those numbers are high . There was evidence of much higher water levels , since the banks showed water lines at least 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weedy junk in the branches at least a couple feet above water . I would n't want to mess with the river when it was that high for sure ! <p> We stopped at one of the bridges and Matt got in my boat solo , and I paddled bow with Mike in the sterm of Matts boat . At some points Matt had a little bit of fun in the current , and he managed to execute an excellent cross draw to save himself from ramming into the bank : ) The weather had improved slowly during the day so it was quite pleasant at times , with the sun coming out from behind the clouds occasionally . This was good , as the forecast had been crappy for the entire weekend . I just love it when the forecast is wrong : ) According to the University of Waterloo Weather Station , the high for the day got up to 10.49oC - but I could have sworn it was 10.50oC ! <p> In the slower moving swampy section just upstream of our takeout point , we found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the river . Matt cut it off and its now at my place . It may someday end up on the fence post or something : ) At around 2 oclock we found ourselves back at the bridge where wed parked the car , and climbed throught the mud again . Mike and I hopped in my car to retrieve the van while Matt carried the stuff up to the side of the road . When we returned with both vehicles , we tied a canoe on each and loaded up our stuff . At this time we were all pretty hungry , so we headed off to Wendys for a good meal . After that , we dropped off Matt and all his stuff and went home . <p> Overall , it was an excellent trip , and a fantastic way to start a new paddling season ! <p> Darren Cope 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @qwx994055 <p> Just completed a day trip on the Nith from Canningto Paris .

It has a bit of rapids , some river travel , some wide open lake travel , and everything you may encounter on a longer trip . 134054 @qwx994054 <p> Introduction : <p> I have written about the route between the Mersey River system and the Medway before , but I will attempt in this to write out a clear and directive paddling guide that will guide the reader easily through the ancient route , long utilized by the MiKmaq , and , later , by Europeans , and I will try to impart a sense of the history behind said route as well . I am beginning my guide at Kejimkujik Lake and ending it at Ponhook , but it will appear as obvious to the astute reader that the actual transfer from drainage system to system is much shorter . In fact , it could be categorized as only really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is up to the discretion of the reader to decide how they wish to access Rossignol , and , by way of it , Carrigan Lake . If you are entering from a different means , I would advise skipping the first part of this guide and going directly down to Rossignol . I am also writing this as a three-day trip . Obviously , many people will choose to shorten or lengthen it , and I would ask that it be remembered that the real goal of this guide is to provide a way between two water-systems . I would hope that adventurers will utilize it to extend their trips . <p> The Mersey River Drainage : <p> The Mersey River is the largest drainage system in Nova Scotia . It reaches as far as Sandy Bottom Lake in Annapolis County and East to Buckshot Lake via the Shelburne River . Waters draining into it include much of the Tobeatic Wilderness Area and Kejmkujik National Park . The Mersey Watershed provided transportation to the MiKmaq , who would use it in conjuction with Bear River and other watesheds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Medway , while nearly on the same scale as the Mersey , is perhaps just as important historically , as it , too , supported bands of MiKmaq and a thriving Salmon population . Later on , it was used to float lumber down river . It is also the outlet for the large lakes of Molega and Ponhook . <p> Kejmkujik Rossignol ( Day 1 ) : <p> You will start your trip at the launch at Jakes Landing . This is inside of Kejmkujik National Park , which you can access by the Number 8 Highway via Annapolis Royal or Liverpool . You may want to stop at the Visitor Interpretation Center on the way in to check on water levels and any obstacles that may have fallen across waters in the park . When my fiancT and I were last there they were very helpful . In your canoe at Jakes Landing , turn left and head down-river towards Kejimkujik Lake . I took a course between Bear Island and Ell Island and then headed straight for Hemlock Island , which is where the Mersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more open , but the water flows swifter in the left , or East channel , which is much narrower . Paddle across George Lake to the beginning of the Portage for the Eel Weir , which is located a little closer to the mouth of the river than is represented on the map . The Eel Weir is a relatively easy run , and , though I am not qualified to judge rapids , I would guess it would be a Class I. I have done it before in a kayak easily , and on my latest trip paddled the empty canoe half-way down and easily eddied-out at a spot we chose during scouting . I advise you scout it , in which case you 'll probably decided to either run it without your gear or maybe portage . It is not far now to Loon Lake . Explore the Northern part of Loon Lake Island to find the portage around the falls , because this one is not where it is marked on the map either . It is a quick portage , however . The alternate route is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of Loon Lake Island . This is not advisable in low water , as there are some jagged rocks at the bottom . The portage is almost as quick , however , being less than 200m . The Mersey winds its way South from Loon Lake Falls , and in high water can appear confusing as there are several long , wide flooded meadows that connect to it at this point , and ocassionaly the flow of the river can be tricky . Simply looking to see where the water is running will simplify this , however , and soon you will find yourself at the Black Rattle , a quick run of water with an ominous name , but which really is n't dangerous at all . Watch out for some sneaky rocks , though ! You will soon come to a bridge over the Mersey , with a gatehouse on the right hand side . This belongs to Bowater , who own most of the land West of Lake Rossignol . On the left hand side you may see a couple of trailers and RVs , and occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and most of them are good hearts and minds . On a trip from Annapolis Royal I was entertained by an older fellow who helped me to coffee , and his wife helped me to some pastries . About 500m beyond the bridge there may be an obstacle across the river in the shape of an eel weir , but I have never seen it as I have always traveled during high water . Keep your eyes open , just in case . Next we paddle into an area of drowned forest . Tall dead trunks of trees stand out of the water , and the river is quite wide . You are almost to Rossignol . When you reach Rossignol , be careful . Every time I have paddled this lake in the evening there has been a strong chop , whether the wind seemed powerful or not . Rossignol is big , and its also shallow , and you ca n't be careful enough . Do n't  take any chances going too far from shore . The lake has its place in the folklore of Queens County , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recommend camping for the night on Rossignol , none the less . There are several small islands between the outflow of the Mersey and the stream leading into Carrigan Lake . One small one in particular , about 800 meters West and a little South of Low Landing , offers a nice spot for a tent and a good stone beach to haul out a canoe on the North side . <p> Carrigan Lake 2nd Christopher Lake ( Day 2 ) <p> If you really wanted to , you could push right through into Ponhook today . Because we were going at an easy pace , my fiancT and I only went as far as 2nd Christopher . To begin with , you 're going to have to find your way into Lacey Bay . Sounds easy , but if you 're not paying attention you may find your way into Gaspar Bay . Do n't  turn left prematurely . There are two ways into Carrigan Lake . One is a small bay at grid reference 044 335 , the other a brook a little further down the shore , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portage , the brook a quick line-up . Brittany and I decided to line up the brook instead of unpacking all of our gear and re-packing it . It was a bit rocky , but very short . We also met a man at the brook fishing , with his wife , and by the trout he had I would say it probably is n't a bad fishing hole . A log down at the top of the run was a bit tricky to get under . Carrigan lake is a lovely paddle . Its length and curves give it a **28;381;TOOLONG kind of excitement . At the most Eastern end of the lake you will find a a low , swampy tributary , and about 25m to the left of that there is an excellent campsite and the beginning of the portage into Appletree Lake . The portage is about one kilometer , and it winds through the woods , through a chopping , and up a steep hill to a road . Follow the road to the left ( you may want to mark where you exited the portage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow ) and when you can see the lake through the trees on your right and the road takes a sharp turn to the left , its time to crash through the trees down a steep incline and find yourself ( hopefully ) at another campsite and a place to put your canoe in . The portage can be hard to find at times , but has been marked with orange flagging tape to help you find your way . Congratulations ! Youve left the Mersey Watershed and entered the Medway . Paddle to the North end of Appletree Lake and find the swampy stream . Follow this until you get to a quick little rocky run , which you can line down , and then hop back in and paddle to the road . Youll have to get out here and carry down the road to the right , until you get to a cabin where you can put back in the water . The little stretch of still water leading out to Telfer Lake is prime turtle country , and Ive seen big snappers and some painted turtles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area around the Christopher Lakes is inhabited by Poison Sumac . A few years ago I was kayaking through here with a friend who got into this , and it left a nasty mess on his leg . He thought he was bit by a spider at the time . Paddle North-East and under the bridge at the end of Telfer Lake . Make sure the water is low enough that you can get under it , or , like my fiancT and I , you may get stuck underneath , pushing the canoe down into the water with your hands on the bridge , and trying to pull the canoe forward and out the other side . Also watch out for the strainer after the bridge , a large live tree that you may be able to paddle around if the water was high enough that you had to carry over the bridge . When you make it past the tree , paddle down the Stillwater until you find the run on your left-hand side . This is a tricky spot to get out of without damaging your boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left hand side , and it is a pretty quick carry down into Fourth Christopher Lake . There is also a nice campsite at the end of the portage , and I have n't spent nearly as many blissful evenings there as I would have liked to . Several come to mind frying trout and eels on hot coals from a good wood fire . Now paddle across Fourth Christopher and down the Stillwater brook on the North side . You will go through a series of little runs and stillwaters that will eventually spit you out into 3rd Christopher Lake . Paddle straight out across this , paying attention to your map to make sure you round the peninsula at the correct point and continue on down into Laurel Lake . There is a little swift narrow spot between 3rd Christopher and Laurel Lake called The Gilmore , where you may care to drop a hook if so inclined . At the other end of Laurel Lake you will find another run that must be portaged , and the portage route is on the right hand side . Be careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the portage . Now load up your gear and paddle about a hundred meters or so downstream and you should find your campsite on the right hand , or South , bank of the stream , where the rock is a bit steep . <p> 2nd Christopher Lake to Ponhook ( Day 3 ) : <p> If you decided to do the trip like Brittany and I and take your time , then you are waking up today on 2nd Christopher Lake , on its Western end . You are going to paddle out of the brook you are in and travel basically NE across the lake , take out at the boat ramp , and carry across the campground to put in at 1st Christopher . I would strongly advise letting the authorities that be know of your intentions , unless there is nobody home . You may be able to get some fresh water from one of the campground taps , too . This is Hibernia , property of the Nova Scotia Guides Association , and they are generally very hospitable people . You 'll find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of 1st Christopher . Paddle up the brook a little way and you will come to the remains of an old stone dam or bridge that is busted through the middle . Take out and carry along the right hand side of this , and then turn left at the road you come to . Carry down the road , through a gate , and put in at the picnic site on the other side . You will paddle under a bridge and come out onto Cameron Lake . That was your last Portage . Now paddle down Cameron Lake , sticking to the shore on your left , and turn North into St. Marys Bay at the end of it , then round the point of land to your right and paddle down the long narrow channel with the cabins on either side . At the bottom turn left and you 're in Ponhook . Congratulations , you 've done it ! Brittany and I paddled to the other end of the Lake , slept on an island by Labelle Brook , and got picked up at the bridge there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the Lake . Another option to being picked up would be trying to go up the Wildcat River into Molega , or up Labelle Brook and into Beaverdam Lake , portage into Black Rattle Lake , and then down the brook and into Molega . I have n't done either of these yet , but when I do I will post them .

We arrived by plane at Kasba Lake lodge at a later date . From there a seaplane brought us to Hinde Lake ( Dubawnt River ) . Our paddling trip ended in the Inuit village of Baker Lake . ( Our canoe was sent back to a town near Montreal by boat from Baker Lake . ) <p> In Canadas Central Arctic we have paddled the following rivers : Kazan , Back , Thelon and Dubawnt . In decreasing order of difficulty are the Back ( most difficult ) followed by the Dubawnt , Kazan and Thelon . <p> The Dubawnt River is very isolated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake and river paddling skills must be combined to good judgement to ensure a safe trip . <p> At medium water level we ran the whole river conducting only 4 portages . Almost no lining was done . All portages have been conducted on tundra terrain devoid of any trail . <p> First portage : canyon between Lake Dubawnt and Grant Lake . Portage on the right side : 4000 meters . Long and violent rapids do exist along this un-runnable but beautiful section . It would be a pity not to take the time to visit this place . <p> Note : to reach Lake Marjorie we chose the branch passing through 64 deg. 02 43.65 N ; 99 deg. 28 20.96 W as referenced on Google Earth . No portage ( or lining ) was necessary along this branch . We can not express an opinion regarding the other branches . They may or may not be more difficult . <p> Third portage : Just after Lake Marjorie : Portage on the right : 100 meters . Some might choose to run this rapid . We judged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Canyon between Lake Marjorie and Beverly Lake . Portage on the left : 400 meters , steep but short climb . It is possible to set many tents on the top of the hill where fine views are obtained . The bedrock can be flaky in the area . Therefore one should not get close to the edge defining the canyons bend . It is not advisable to run this canyon along the left bank as there is a huge and dangerous hole at the start . It might be possible to run the canyon from the right bank but we suspect this to be a dubious proposition . Portaging along the right bank seemed much longer than along the left bank . <p> To reduce to a minimum the number of portages the following trick proved as useful on the Dubawnt as on so many other rivers of the Canadian Shield . As a rule one should avoid paddling on the side of the river where the Canadian Shield ( hard bedrock which is not easily eroded ) shows on the surface . Choose instead the bank where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rivers slope shall probably be more even there . A " spiky " side appearing on the map is a good indication that the Canadian Shield will likely show on the surface thus creating ledges and potentially un-runnable rapids . Hopefully , the opposite side might not show the Canadian Shield and thus benefit from a more even slope . <p> Lake Dubawnt is enormous and very cold . One is likely ( as happened to us ) to see some ice floating here and there during July or beginning of August . Much ice could be encountered . Capsizing on Lake Dubawnt can easily mean death through hypothermia . One must be very careful to avoid being swept by the wind far from the shore . <p> To get icebound on Dubawnt Lake in July or August is possible . To avoid this we called Baker Lake lodge just before starting our trip in order to make sure that the ice breakup on Baker Lake was not unusually late . Had this been the case we would have chosen to paddle the Kazan River instead of the Dubawnt for fear of being icebound on Lake Dubawnt.

In this dry region , there are many occasional creeks which seldom flow , but in rains they can make a big differnec very quickly . Consider low water to be in the low teens , for it becomes pretty difficult to get a canoe down the river much below 12 m3/s .

Impatient with this shuttling , anticipating 2002 first overnighter on a river , I set the cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spot the Pronghorns running through the coulees and hoodoos . Finally , we launched at 11am under overcast skies at 16*C . The river was running brown and it was impossible to see rocks under the water . Jennifer had much practice on reading the water to learn what lurked below , which was many rocks . A couple of corners past the Goldstream campground , we all had our heads cranked to river right eyeing a drowned cow , bloating on the shore . Well , the Enzsols canoe , autopilot must not have been working as they breeched on a half meter round rock . As the canoe filled with water and the fibreglass bent around the rock I could hear the sickening sound of cracking . Trent was quick to react as he bound into the river and started dragging the stern upstream while barking at Linda to get out and bail . While Linda was franticly bailing and Trent strained against the river they both failed to notice water was still pouring over the gunnel . By now we had eddied out however the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped canoe so I went racing downstream along the bank to fetch their paddles , water bottles , before the disappeared around the next corner . Up to my chest in the next eddy I was surprised the water was n't colder . Upon my return the impaled Clipper was safely in our eddy and Trent was sucking back a beer . Linda looked sheepish and Justin ( 11yrs old ) was struggling to contain his laughter . He finally broke loose as he exclaimed they should change the canoe from Clipper to Flipper . Stephanie added that we should call it " Dead Cow Rock " . We all laughed . I discussed with Trent how impressed I was that his glass boat could concave that much without any real damage . During lunch at Red Bluff , which marks the start of the water carved sandstone cliffs , we were surprised by a group in two rented Colemans beaching by ramming headfirst onto the shore where the male stern paddled leapt into the river to drag the canoe nose first up the bank . As his girlfriend , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll and she flopped onto the beach . Trent and I looked at each other with raised eyebrows . They came sprinting towards us stating the third canoe was tipped back upstream where the Red Creek meets on river right . But , before any of us could formulate a rescue they came floating by into the eddy . We mingled for a while then we departed to let them have the beautiful lunch spot to themselves . By 5pm it was starting to spit a little and the girls were weary of peering into the murky waters for those pesky rocks . I was looking at the map trying to establish how much further to Poverty Rock where we planned to camp . Our canoes were two abreast as Trent and I were discussing something when we entered the Outcrop rapid which has a high sandstone wall on the left and the river makes a 180* turn to the right . In rush for paddles and positioning we made a most ungraceful run and fumbled into the eddy at the end of the switchback as we jammed and jarred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer can flipped into the river and I almost flipped as I retrieved it . As we all floated in the eddy shaking our heads at how " novice " our actions were we realized there was a large blue raft just downstream with a huge film camera on tripod filming us ! As we floated down and introduced ourselves we discovered they were from the Discovery Channel and were filming a documentary on the Milk River . We were so embarrassed by our behaviour we retreated , and hauled our gear to Poverty Rock to set up camp . An after note to this is when I watched the documentary , later that fall . Thankfully we ended up on the cutting room floor . Poverty Rock has a large shelter that is closed in on three sides . Inside there are benches and two picnic tables . Just outside there is a large fire pit with wood . Milk River Raft Tours hauls in the firewood and generously let us burn it . They were the guides taking the Discovery Channel filmers . Although it was raining we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridge you could see that the river once flowed wider around the rock but eventually broke through leaving a tower stranded in a dried up meander . The next day the 20km paddle to Writing-on-Stone was uneventful and we did n't  hesitate , as it was raining and windy and quite chilly . The spray decks kept us warm inside while keeping the rain out . We took the self-guided tour through the park looking at the Petroglyphs and were disgusted how people have carved their names into the sand cliff often destroying these 250-500 year old messages left to us from the Shoshone people who first move to this region 700 years ago . Excavations show that people have visited this valley for 10,000 years . We reflected upon this as we effortlessly cruised home on the smooth four lane highway in our heated vehicle . We left the Milk River with a feeling of a magical and hidden place . The hoodoos peered down on us passing beneath them like native sentries . The Coulees and dry creek beds echoed with history , as the wind seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enables one to travel at a speed and position where they are entwined in natures motion , yet we leave trace of our passing . Thus , any canoeist who travels behind us experiences this untouched view leaving them with the same sense of discovery .

There is a charge for parking and launching plus they offer a shuttle service . You can take out at any of the bridges from Nicolston to Angus as well . The banks in the summer are steep and muddy making access difficult . In Angus you can access from the field across from Alma St. You can drive quite close to within 100m of the banks of the river and the banks are not so steep here .

Edenvale Conservation area is another good spot to acess the Nottawasaga . There is a picnic area there and even though the signs say no camping I think you are allowed as a through traveller .

As you enter the park turn to your left and there is a dock installed by the Canoe Club of Wasaga Beach . From the river it is the dock just past the bridge on your right side . Just before reaching Klodike Park Rd the river opens up into a shallow weedy lake . There is some good opportunities to fish for Pike , Bass , Catfish , Carp and Salmon all here .

Expect to see plenty of Great Blue Herons , Belted Kingfishers , Spotted Sanpipers , Cormorants , Turkey Vultures and there is even a Bald Eagle nesting in the Minesing Swamp now .

I also suggest satellite imaging the river ahead of time and count the jams yourself .

Put the canoe in the water and loaded up the gear . Parked the car in the parking lot and headed out onto the water . Headed south and as soon as I got around the point I got blasted by the southwest wind . Hopped in behind the Islands as much as possible to keep out of the wind . After reaching Denedus Point the wind was really blowing to hard to follow the north shore of Shingwood bay so I crossed over to Denedus Island to escape the wind About 3/4 across it started to rain but the wind was to strong for me to stop and put on the rain gear .

There is a shallow section just before the take out but I was able to push through without getting out . <p> The portage into Olier Lake is fairly easy as it fallows an old road most of the way and is fairly level . There are some nice big old red pines along this trial . Olier lake is a pretty little lake and a short paddle takes you across to the southeast bay and the portage into Denedus Lake . This portage is 410 fairly flat but a few wet spots and some round stones to walk over . It started to rain quite heavy just before reaching the portage till about half way through the portage . <p> Denedus Lake is another pretty lake a bit bigger and has a couple of campsites on the island . I paddled past these to the portage into Wasaksina Lake . Another easy portage of 130 . About 1 km from here and I stopped at the island campsite for the night . A very nice site with room for 3 or 4 tents . The wind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured every thing and got into the tent a bit after 8 as it started to rain a bit again . <p> Saturday <p> Got up and had breakfast and the wind is still blowing . Blew my hat into the lake and I had to put the canoe in to retreive it . On the water at about 7:30 and headed east along the north shore . Then padled north into the long narrow bay which turns into a creek . The water is deep and someone has been good enough to cut the trees that were hanging across the river so it is an easy paddle into Driftwood lake Followed Driftwood to the northern bay to the portage into Iceland Lake . There is about a dozen fishing boats tied up here . That is the reason all the trees had been cut . The portage 345 is a bit hilly and not as easy as the first 3 . There is a rotten old dock at the other end that requires caution . <p> On Iceland head to the point and go left to the south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Tetapaga river.There is a short 50 m. portage on the right here but I was able to work the canoe thrugh this shallow rocky area into the river . Followed the river to the central access road culvert . There on the left side I climbed up to the road and crossed the bridge to the right side and followed the portage to a small lake ( 265 ) A short paddle across the lake and another portage ( 135 ) to another small lake.Another time that I travelled this way I took the lane on the left for a single 500 m portage . This is the easier way to go . <p> Stay to the left along this little lake to the river outlet . It was a bit shallow the first 50 ft. or so but OK after that . Followed the river till it gets shallow with logs across . Portage ( 515 ) on the right . After about 300 m you have to cross the river on round rocks . there is enough rocks that the water is between them and I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portage and is the hardest one on this loop . From there it is a short paddle to the Northeast Arm . There were whitecaps marching along as I came out into the Arm so I stuck to the left shore heading southwest . About 1 km along I stopped at a campsite and had lunch and to decide if I should stop because of the wind or try to go a bit farther . After a good lunch I decided that I would try to go a bit farther and work my way across the Arm to the other side to portage up into Command and McLaren Lakes . It started out not to bad but got as rough as I feel comfortable in . Made it across to the islands then around to the north side and a scoot across to the campsite east of the portage up into Hay lake . The campsite looked very nice and I felt a few drops of rain so instead of taking a chance and portaging in the rain I decided to call it a day . Set up camp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  start the fire as it was still to windy . Walked along the shore to the portage trail and fallowed it up to Hay Lake .

I guess I 'll have to learn to pace myself a bit better . The rain held off and I was able to start a fire later on . After supper I was again sent into the tent by a bit of rain . <p> Sunday <p> Up at daybreak . Had breakfast tore down camp and on the water at 7:00 . The wind is down and the water is calm .

The second half is somewhat harder . A few tips : 1 ) The topographical maps do n't  join up perfectly . Keep this in mind gauging the distance . 2 ) On Iceland Lake there are two portages not easy seen , as this is where the two maps meet . The portage to Tetapaga river is a very easy 50m portage with almost no trees . This is the portage you want . The other portage to Heritage creek is probably about 200m . This is not the portage you want unless you want to kill an hour or so exploring a small quite stream . 3 ) The portage across the access road is on the right side of the road . It is hard to see from the road . It follows the river to a wider part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Many of the portages are overgrown . I would recommend walking your packs across them first to before try to figure out where you 're going with a boat on your head . 5 ) There are motor boats on many of the lakes .

The second half is defiantly more scenic , although there is a tiny waterfalls on one of the portages the first day that is quite nice . Bring bug spray ... Happy Tripping Mike Beck www.slash24.com

There were very few people heading out on the portage trails this early in the year . The weather was warm and sunny . One of the highlights of the trip was the marsh we found behind a series of 3 tiered beaver dams just left of the first portage into Lower Crane . a beaver slapped its ' tail as we pulled the canoe over the first dam . We were able to walk the canoe over the the next two small ponds into the lower marsh made by the beavers.It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowering shrubs . The scenary in the marsh was dominated by two huge birds nests perched high atop two tall tree trunks in the middle of the pond . We camped the first night on Lower Crane on a ridge at campsite 56 . The wind sweeping across the ridge kept the blackflies down and we were able to enjoy a brisk swim and then sun out on the warm rock ridge overlooking the lake . The sky was clear that night and we were able to watch the pick out the constellations with ease away from the glare of town lights . The next day we canoed into Upper crane and say a mother moose and her young fawn by the waters edge . She looked at us wearily but allowed us to come close enough to take some great photos before she nuzzled her young fawn back into the shelter of the woods . Two short and easy portages later we were in Cinder Lake . We found a different species of trillium growing along the portage trails . They are white with a burgandy center we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again on a point of land facing into the wind to drive the bugs back . We had packed in three days food in a 35 litre plastic barrel . Our menu consisted of our favorite dehydrated sauces , brown rice and pasta , fresh fruits , eggs , humus and sunflower bread . We had a Katadyn water purifyer system with us and had packed tea and coffee . We spent a day exploring the lake and stopped at a bay between campsite 75 and 76 to picnic and paint . The scenary is inspiring . Light Ochre coloured rock outcrops rise smoothly out of the water there backdropped by a cluster of submerged sunbleached old tree stumps which curve gracefully around them onto the northern shore . We saw loons , blue herons , sandpipers and various species of ducks . The next day we headed back . We took the western portage route back .

MISSING PORTAGE SIGN We could not find the poratage sign or the route on that small Lake . We searched the shore for well over an hour .

We retraced our path and took the route we took into Cinder from Poker back . We decided to take the western poratage into Bentshoe from there . It is a 400 metre portage over a ridge . It was a tough climb up over fallen rocks and between the boulders , fighting the blackflies all the way but the going down was a breeze .

@@107413070 @2813070/ 134052 @qwx994052 134053 @qwx994053 <h> Single Canoe Self-Recovery <p> Canoe safety traditions have it that if you go flatwater canoeing , either you go with other canoes so you can do the canoe-over-canoe recovery , or you stay within swimming distance of shore . Of course , we all know violations of these guidelines are typical . Sometimes lone canoes suffer fatal accidents as a result , but even multiple canoes can get into trouble . One outcome of this is that the non-canoeing public likely regards canoeing as an inherently unsafe recreation . <p> So it would seem valuable to investigate deep water , unassisted canoe recovery . Deep water meaning being out of reach of shore , and unassisted meaning the presence of only a tandem canoe , perhaps even a solo canoe . <p> Canoe literature pays scant attention to spraydecks , and has nothing to say ( that I 've seen ) about recovering a spraydecked canoe in deep water . I guess people assume the canoe will be accompanied and will be de-spraydecked and emptied in preparation for a canoe-over-canoe recovery . My opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not something reserved for expeditions and whitewater . <p> What little advice there is about using a canoe spraydeck completely fails to recognize that capsizing and recovering a spraydecked canoe is completely different from an open canoe . The situation in fact has more in common with capsizing a kayak . The key factor is that a spraydeck will prevent most water from invading a capsized and righted canoe . <p> This , in turn , has two unfamiliar results . The first is that the capsized canoe will be difficult to right . The second is that the righted canoe is relatively empty of water and so is viable for immediate continued travel -- as long as the crew can get back in . <p> I have to point out that the scope of our experiments included only one model of canoe , a total of three people , and a modified NorthWater spraydeck . The cord lacing on the spraydeck has been replaced with thick shock cord , which attaches to nylon hooks bolted to the sides of the canoe . I should n't speculate about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but our spraydeck attaches and detaches in seconds . <h> The Capsize <p> Now , it 's plain that sufficiently rough seas can prevent any recovery . We have tried to find a usable recovery method , not so that we can blithely go out in storms or open ocean , but to recover from isolated circumstances . Such as a capsize resulting from a rogue wave , boat wake , crew error , or a wave dropping one end of the canoe on a submerged rock . We will rely on other means to avoid extended threatening situations , such as watching the weather . <p> It seems canoeists agree on the observation that spontaneous , totally unexpected capsizes on flat water just do n't happen . But since we ca n't control everything , it 's important to be prepared anyway . <p> I have only capsized in pools . Even that is disorienting for a few moments . While it 's important to brace and know how to brace to prevent an incipient capsize , things change when you know you 're going over . Keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can use that hand to keep the canoe from bonking you on the head as it goes over , and it 's important to be holding onto the canoe immediately after the capsize . <p> Take some time to collect your wits and relax and recover from the cold shock . Even in cold water , as Dr. Gordon Giesbrecht points out at this link , you have time to gather yourself without using up the time needed to sort things out . Take a minute to calm down , check on the others , and agree on a course of action . Even in freezing water , you have at least 10 minutes before you 're too numb to get out of the water , and at least an hour before you die . On the other hand , panicking because you 're in a big rush to get out of the water NOW , can sabotage your recovery before it even gets started . <p> I 've read this elsewhere , and will repeat it here : do n't worry about flotsam drifting away . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But try to keep hold of your paddle , and stow it in the canoe as soon as it 's upright . <p> It can not be overemphasized that these techniques should be practiced to the point of being drills . Being in a life-threatening situation is no time to experiment or try to teach someone else what you 're proposing to do about it . While running these scenarios through my mind the last couple of years , I was certain some things would work that turned out to be completely useless , or very difficult . Some things were easier than expected , while other things were simply not foreseen . <h> Righting the Canoe <p> Again , this is completely different from righting an open canoe . The good thing is that there will be little water in the canoe . While practicing this , we could do 3 to 4 capsize/righting cycles before needing to empty the canoe . The bad thing is that the upside-down canoe has to roll and lift its weight up over the bulging side of the canoe . <p> We tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the crew to go to the ends of the canoe , and twist on them to flip the canoe . <p> Last time we practiced this , I was unable to right the canoe this way by myself . I know someone who has done this by himself in waves , and perhaps the waves help . My wife and I were just barely able to do it . This time , with a friend , it was almost easy . I do n't know if that was because of improved technique , or a stronger partner , but we were able to do it easily enough that I would be willing to bet my life on it . <p> The second way is a little harder to describe . We positioned ourselves so that we could each reach under the canoe and grasp the opposite gunnel . At the same time we lifted on the adjacent gunnel , we pulled the far gunnel towards us . Presto , the canoe rolled upright . I was surprised at how easily we did this , but I 'm wary that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The third way was the easiest . For each of these stages of the recovery , I wanted to find a method that one person could accomplish . Partly so that they would be usable by solo paddlers , and partly so that a recovery would still work in bad conditions or if your partner was unable to help . <p> While cogitating about our first evening 's attempts , I got the idea that a strap tied to a thwart , and draped across the bottom of the inverted canoe could be used to right the canoe . I mentioned this to a friend who has been a river raft guide , and is a CRCA instructor . He immediately said : " Yes , absolutely , it will work . " He added that this is how river rafts are righted . <p> So I made up a strap and tried it in the pool . The canoe righted so easily it was n't funny . Actually , it was funny . It took seconds , and worked whether I started with my feet against the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter was a failed attempt to get on top of the inverted canoe by using the strap . The canoe righted before I came anywhere near getting on top of it . It worked whether the strap was tied to the center yoke , or one of the mid-point thwarts . <p> I used tubular climbing webbing for the strap . It needs to be only about 4 feet long . Doubled , with simple knots gives both loops and the knots to aid as your hands get stiff . I found it very easy to grip . We will keep it attached to a thwart and bundled up under the side of the spraydeck . <p> There was a method of righting the canoe that utterly failed . I inserted a double paddle between the spraydeck and both gunnels , and attempted to use it as a lever . No way could I get enough leverage on it to do anything . Maybe it would work with two people , but since the other methods worked so well , there 's no sense pursuing it . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's less than an inch of water in it . Now for the tricky part . <p> The first thing we tried was for one swimmer to hold a gunnel , and the other person climb in . This worked surprisingly well , but the other person did it much more easily than I did . He is a lot stronger than I am , but was wearing a wetsuit rather than a pfd . Last time , my wife was unable to do this . So this ability will vary considerably from person to person . If the gunnel submerged , the spraydeck kept water out of the canoe . <p> Next it was time for the second person to climb in . We were able to do this by having the person already in the canoe lean far to the opposite side of the person reentering . Once , our timing was off and we rolled on over . I suspect a loaded canoe would be less skittish . This seemed simple enough that I wondered why I had thought it could n't be done . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to reenter at the center , where the canoe has the most stability from width . But it 's also too far to reach the far gunnel . An important disadvantage of the spraydeck is that it covers the thwarts you could otherwise grab to haul yourself across the boat . It might be worth attaching webbing handgrips across the width of the spraydeck . <p> Another important thing to point out is that you should be horizontal in the water before initiating reentry . This means you have less of your body to lift , and will not be trying to somehow haul your folded body over the gunnel . <p> There are several ways to get horizontal . Obviously one way is to kick your legs to the surface behind you . Being on the windward side of a boat being blown downwind will help this . Another way is to hook a leg into the cockpit , and shift your weight onto the canoe until you can reach the far gunnel . There 's another way , but I 'll get to that soon . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about using a paddlefloat , and we always carry one on deep water trips , alone or not . Ours is made of two Mohawk paddles that clip together like a big kayak paddle . We have clip-on T-grips to convert them to spare regular paddles , and a kayak paddlefloat that goes on one blade . <p> Last time we tried this , we found it hardly worked because the assembly was not securely attached to the canoe . I rigged up some straps , but still found the arrangement came apart too easily . Better was having the paddle inserted between the spraydeck and the gunnel on both sides of the canoe , but it still was n't good enough . I think an additional paddle pocket on the spraydeck is needed , plus some sort of strap for the handle . <p> Our first paddlefloat was a cheap kayak paddle with a stuff sack containing a chunk of styrofoam attached to one end . Now we have the Mohawk , and a real NorthWater paddlefloat . In one way , the homemade version was better . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight would help keep the canoe from capsizing to the side away from the float . The latest paddlefloats have a water pocket for this purpose . <p> I was able to reenter the unoccupied canoe unassisted using the paddlefloat , but it was more difficult than with someone holding the other side of the canoe . It was not hard to sink the float . I suspect it just needs more practice , but it can be done . <p> I tried attaching a webbing stirrup to the shaft of the paddlefloat , but this mostly succeeded in dislodging the paddle . Attaching the stirrup to a thwart was far more stable and made a " vertical " reentry easier , but not much . Initiating reentry from a horizontal position works better , and there 's no use for a stirrup then . <p> Reentering the canoe with the paddlefloat , and someone else already in it counterbalancing me , was better . Then I discovered that if I hooked an ankle over the shaft of the paddlefloat , it was even easier to get back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would be that much more stable to regain our positions , bail , etc . <p> Where you get back in the canoe is something to consider . With an empty but spraydecked canoe , it might be best to open a center hatch ( if so equipped ) , and get in there because you 're using the width of the canoe . But once there , you probably still need to get to your seat . Probably this is best for the first person , to keep the canoe trimmed better . The second person can reboard at their seat . For a loaded canoe , a center boarder will end up atop the baggage , raising the center of gravity . As mentioned before , we suspect reentry would be easier with a load due to the canoe having more inertia and riding lower . <p> We did n't test reentering over an end of the canoe . <h> Upside Down Paddling <p> Since the capsized , decked canoe has so much initial stability , it would seem logical it could be used to advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mounting the inverted canoe and paddling it to safety . Well , I do n't know how he did it . I could not get on top of the capsized canoe . The other fellow succeeded , but it immediately rolled him off . Verdict : not a reliable technique . <h> PFD 's <p> I have speculated that movements such as reentering a canoe work better if your pfd is propery positioned on your trunk . My pfd is a reasonably decent one , but despite not being overweight and having plenty of time to fuss with it , I was unable to keep it from riding far up on my chest during this practice . Unless one has the priviledge of a waist size somewhat smaller than one 's chest , I do n't see what 's to keep a pfd without a crotch strap from riding up , no matter how tight it is . You 're asking something to slide the wrong way on a cone . On the other hand , pear-shaped bodies should float better and stay warmer in the water . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including myself , as the cat 's ass canoe/kayak boots . One thing not mentioned about them so far , is how they perform in a capsize . For some of the testing , I donned my knee-high , neoprene Chota mukluks . <p> Your first dunking with them is an eye-opener . Being neoprene , they float . But there 's another consideration . The well-designed top strap and seal means there is air trapped inside . The skinnier your lower leg , the more air . This is a pretty significant amount of flotation , and when you enter the water , your feet zoom to the surface . Depending on what you want to do , this can be a curse or a blessing . I 'd hate to be in this situation without a pfd to float the upper body . <p> For instance , to reenter the canoe , you want to be facing down , with your body horizontal . But the favoured resting position for someone wearing a pfd and " inflated " Chotas , is on your back with your feet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change to the desired position . This effect can interfere with swimming , and the easiest way to deal with it would seem to be to let your legs float out behind you and paddle with your hands . <p> Fortunately , as you struggle to get your feet where you want them , they will go deep enough that water pressure will force the air out of the boots . That leaves you with the flotation only of the neoprene , which is enough to be helpful but not a nuisance . Some water will get into them , but not a whole lot , and you do n't notice it until you leave the water . I got about a cupful in each of mine over a half hour of submersion . <p> One thing we did n't test was removing the boots while in the water . <p> Lastly on the Chotas : entrapment . Our canoe has very low seats . I tried kneeling , which requires the boots be under the seat . They were so jammed under there that I was not willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming pool . I know that in the past I 've claimed this is a theoretical problem only , with no known fatalities resulting from it , but after this test I wo n't be poo-pooing that concern any more . <h> In Conclusion <p> I 'm aware that these methods involve more " gizmos " , and in emergencies you do n't want to be fussing around with stuff . But the techniques do work , and I believe that sorting them out greatly expands the safety envelope . <p> Then there 's politics . I 'm free to experiment and advocate such things because I have little vested interest in the canoe scene 's status quo . Some will simply ignore these ideas . Some will just respond that novices should n't use spraydecks , stay out of danger , and not go out alone . <p> Some will claim that adoption of the methods will cause beginners to venture to their demise due to misplaced faith in the promise of safety from the ideas . I do n't buy that . While that is one consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sensible far outweigh the lure to the dumb . What I would like to see is for highly respected canoeists try out these methods , hopefully agree on their value , and endorse them within the sport . <p> Embracing such methods would not only make canoeing more appealing to gear junkies , but could help advance an image of canoeing being inherently safe . I 'm afraid it sounds grandiose , but I do believe these methods could save lives and widen the appeal of canoeing . <p> So all in all , we were quite pleased with the session , which we crammed into one hour . It took place at UBC 's awesome more-than-Olympic standard pool , where , due to peculiar circumstances , we had the vast pool to ourselves with no spectators or staff . We will do another session some time , just to refine the moves , and my wife needs to learn them . We 're also not sure yet whether the more agile person should be the first or second to reboard the canoe .

If we are from Canada , we probably know this piece of gear as a Woods pack . <p> Woods No. 1 and Woods No. 200 Canoe Packs <p> Duluth Packs <p> Both of these packs are of sturdy canvas construction with strong leather straps . They are equipped with a tump line to help support the load over portages . Buckles are substantial , and all leather to canvas joints are riveted . <p> These packs are n't sexy or high-tech , but they are still in use by paddlers all over North America , and for good reason . They are strong and durable , and when they are damaged they can be repaired . Any canvas-repair shop can put on a patch , and leather straps can be repaired or replaced . Modern packs with fancy suspension systems and plastic buckles are often more challenging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - they are strictly a way of carrying large volumes of gear on wilderness canoe trips . They are essentially a big , open bag with no interior compartments . This means that we are not limited to how you fill it or what you stuff in it . It really is almost impossible to completely fill one of these packs - there always seems to be room to stuff in one final item . These flexible packs also fit well into a canoe - they are the ideal size for sitting crossways in a canoe , and if they are n't overstuffed , they will fit under the thwart or portage yoke . Keeping the centre of gravity of our load as low as possible in a canoe is important in rough weather , and canvas packs help us accomplish this . <p> Are they waterproof ? No way !

Of course ! <p> For a start , many companies are now duplicating the traditional canvas canoe pack in durable materials like Cordura or heavy nylon . Many of these packs have more comfortable straps , waist belts and good suspension systems . <p> Some of these packs even have internal frames , formerly reserved for backpacking gear . These rigid frames help distribute loads evenly , while the traditional shape of the canoe pack is maintained . <p> There are also many waterproof packs specifically designed for canoeing . Some have very comfortable suspension systems including waist belts , and are quite waterproof . There are some cautions , however . Waterproofing on these packs relies on two things ; the material that the pack is made from , and the closure system at the top of the pack . Waterproof material may not be quite as watertight once it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seasons , and closures must be rolled and sealed very carefully to be effective . Still , we use this type of pack for carrying light loads like sleeping bags and clothing . <p> Seal Brand Waterproof Packs <p> Backpacking packs with internal or external frames may be comfortable for trekking across portages , but they are not practical for canoeing . Capacities are not high enough , and frames are very awkward to fit into canoes . <p> Increasing numbers of paddlers are carrying their gear in barrels , another good option .

The " 16.6 " is most famous for its stability , maneuverability , and all-round performance Our most popular canoe just keeps getting rave reviews by our customers ! Great in any conditions and perfect for long interior trips , this canoe is the choice with dogs aboard , or children , or for the photographer or angler . Safety and responsiveness in one boat , thanks to the shallow arch design , coupled with moderate to high rocker . Solo , Tandem , or Loaded , the Prospector 16.6 can do it all ! Just add water <p> Great all round boat ! Bought three years ago and have used for everything from cruising our home town lake with the dogs , weekend trips on various lakes , creeks and rivers to extended trips at Killarney and Algonquin . Paddles fast and true , holds a ton of gear , easy and light portage ( kevlar with wood trim .. not the ultralite ) , very stable when loaded and instills confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  understand gel coat complaints i have read above .... we have had no problems and have put this boat through its paces . Wood trim requires yearly love but gives this boat its charm . Would recommend this boat anyday for almost any use . Another great thing ... will paddle in almost no water loaded to the gunwhales .. great for shortening those portages if you can find any little beaver trail ... <p> The Langford Cedar Canoes are unmatched in the international marketplace today . There are seemingly no comparable canoes to be found anywhere else . Check out the 16 ' 6 " at http : //www.langfordcanoe.net <p> I tested the Nahanni and the Prospector and while the Nahanni was fast a tracked wonderfully , I decided on the Propector becasue of it 's diversity of uses and capacity . I have only paddled it empty so far but this boat is qucik and responsive . The finish is flawless and the complaints noted above I find puzzling . I was told by the salesman that flawed finished boats are used for test paddling and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The salesman turned one upside down and stood on the widest part of the bottom and it hardly moved . Impressive for sure . The standard cherry seats and kneeling thwarts are comfortable and apealing to the eye . The standard sliding bow seat moves smoothly but not so smoothly that it will shift while sitting on it . Should be an excellent boat for many many years to come . <p> Well , for starters the hull is a bit less than a true prospector and this can be seen by the sudden and not gradual rocker and the ends . The gel coat has not held up well at all and the wood trim has faired the same . I hope that Langford have addressed these issues . <p> love it . before buying i read alot of reviews , quite a number complained about fit and finish , especially inside the boat . i just wanted to say that if anyone had problems with the fit and finish of this boat , there out of thier minds . so i do n't  know if langford is inconsistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reccomend this boat ! ! <p> Great paddling boat . Excellent load capacity . Excellent combination of maneuverability and tracking . A little heavier than advertised and trim had some irregularities . Beautiful and functional yoke . Good seats which we had dropped more in front for better kneeling . Gel coat requires repair a little more often than ideal , but overall a very nice boat . We bought one of first of these boats and got good price . This boat is more expensive now . <p> We tested , read about and searched web reviews before choosing this boat and we are very happy with it . Any review of a boat is going to be ultra individual specific not to mention it 's difficult to admit mistakes : ) Best qualities are fantastic stability ( important to us small kids ) holds a ton of gear , manuverable as well as fairly fast , easy to portage .

A tripping canoe should be a minimum of 16 ft. long ... and that 's a bare minimum ; and if it is to be used for longer trips , it should probably be at least 17 ft . Canoes used on extended trips will often be 18 ft. or longer . Canoes shorter than 16 ft simply do not have the volume required to carry a large load of gear and keep it dry . <p> Is there a tradeoff involved in length ? <p> Of course , as with everything related to canoe design . Longer canoes are generally capable of faster speeds , and will handle large rolling swells better . <p> Shorter canoes are more maneuverable and will handle whitewater better because of their shorter turning radius .

Judging by the river channel cut and bordering shrubs , the lower level has prevailed for some time , and is probably similar to the level encountered by Daryl on his trip in 1995 .

The pole clips allow greater air circulation for reduced condensation , and are colour-coded for rapid set-up . The inner tent can be set up without the fly as a bug tent on fine nights . If you would like a bit more stability in wind , consider our less spacious but lower-profile Tarn 2 . <p> I LOVE this tent . Bought it in 2002 prior to a trip across Europe - no matter how rainy the rainy season was we could count on the Tarn being dry when we got back . Since then we 've tripped with it inummerable times and every time I set it up I feel happy . Little tip - if it looks fair out we usually set up with the fly pegged down at the front but rolled up off the back , leaving the view open . If it starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down - quick and easy ! You wo n't regret this tent ... <p> I received this as a birthday present last year , and after a summer of using this tent instead of the camp-provided one , I can say I am one happy tripper ! It is roomy for two people and having a vestibule was a god-send for keeping shoes and knapsacks dry in the rain . It is also super-convenient in that if you bend the right way , you do n't let any weather into the tent while you do the Crocodile-mile dive into the tent on a rainy ( or buggy ) night . The vast quantities of mesh are great for breathability , I used it for two straight months without getting any really noticible scent lingering . I have the blue and white version of the tent , which came with the bright yellow fly . Adding in the angled windows in the fly and extending the vestibule has had my tent dubbed " The Angry Duck . " I can hardly argue with that , because it really does . <p> Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for 2 people , but as the tent description says on the MEC site ( ' cosy for 3 , comfortable for 2 ' ) ... exactly what it is !

An excellent tent , I would buy the same tent again when this one gets destroyed from use ! <p> Good tent ! I have had it for just over 2 years now , and it has stood up to everything that Northern Ontario can dish out . The footprint has been a life saver . The body door has in my opinion a few too many zippers . While it adds some convienence , the added weight is n't quite worth it . <p> Very happy with this tent , though I would not even think of sleeping three in this tent . The no-see-um mesh stood up very well to my puppy 's claws on his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one hole . The vestibule is quite low - we often will set up the tent at the edge of a ledge - but its large enough for our chinook husky , our brittany/cocker spaniel mix and our duffel bag to cohabit . The tension at the front of the tent seems slack , otherwise it seems well designed . <p> I purchased this tent three years ago and have used it frequently . It packs small enough to fit into my 16ft. kayak and I can set it up in the dark . Dry , roomy , and with all the tarp tie downs secured to trees or rocks , it ai n't moving . Pleanty of space for two , and big enough not to drive you squirrley if you 're stuck in it by yourself for a rainy day or two . The peg out vestible is handy for paddles and packs and wet boots .

The most efficient/functional shape of any tent I have used or come across .

Has full fly with vestibule . Vestibule is fairly small so you 'd be cramped trying to remove wet clthes with the door shut .. Great tent for the price . <p> For the price it 's a great tent . For summer canoeing it 's performed very well . When it 's hot the large section of netting airs out the tent well . Three people can fit snugly or 2 can fit with tons of room . Quick to set-up .

Although the MNR route description gives the route a two-day duration . We felt that three days were required to give us adequate time for sightseeing along the way . <p> To avoid a long drive on Friday morning ( our planned start day ) , we drove up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the trip is at the end of Hwy 557 , which runs north from the town of Blind River on Hwy 17 . The road was in good condition , and the trip from Blind River to Lake Matinenda took about twenty minutes . The parking lot was full when we arrived . Camping facilities at the parking area do not exist , so we camped at the Log Chateau , a lodge on Lake Matinenda . Facilities at this lodge are basic - a grass field , a single fire pit and an outhouse . <p> Day One ( Friday ) We were on the water by 9:30 am . We followed the west shore of Matinenda as we travelled north . There were a lot of cottages in the first 3 km of the route , but they became less common as we travelled further north on the lake . At the 8 km point of the route , we left Matinenda and entered the mouth of the Blind River . This section of the river is narrow , winding and very scenic . <p> Although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dam across the Blind River halfway between Matinenda and Chiblow . This is the first portage of the trip . The portage is about 250 m long , and goes around the right side of the dam . It is a well-groomed uphill climb for the first half , but it becomes narrow , steep and increasingly rocky as it descends towards the river . Although it was dry when we portaged , it was obvious to us that the trail would be slippery and treacherous if wet . After portaging the first canoe along the awkward trail , we decided to carry the gear across and lift the canoes directly over the dam . By paddling over the log boom and staying to the right ( away from the sluice on river left ) we brought the canoes straight to the dam . The top of the concrete dam is wide enough to stand on , and we simply had to pass down the canoes from the day to the dry , rocky shoreline about 6 ft. below us . The " river " below the dam is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grind down to the end of the portage trail . At this point we reloaded the packs and carried on down the river . <p> A short while later , we reached Chiblow Lake . There was a gravelly beach on the south side of the lake just after we entered it that was a great lunch and swimming spot . Although it would n't be ideal , this spot could hold two or three tents . <p> We paddled across the first bay of Chiblow and camped on one of the islands just east of Fox Point , the 12 km point of the trip . The largest island ( closest to the point ) has a cottage on it . The site we used was on the island farthest away from the point . It is a beautiful location - soft , level ground with a mix of red pine and white pine above . The island appears to be well-used . There is little underbrush left , and there is no firewood on the island . It is still a great site , with convenient trees to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points for swimming and relaxing . We were set up by 2:00 pm . <p> The site was strewn with garbage when we arrived , left by a previous fishing party . After burning all of the paper garbage and beer cases , we were still forced out to pack out over a full garbage bag of trash and a couple of broken lawn chairs . <p> Day Two ( Saturday ) We broke camp at 9:15 am and headed southwest on Chiblow towards High Lake . Although the water was quite calm , it was not difficult to imagine what conditions would be like in a stiff west wind . Chiblow is a huge lake , and the resulting waves would be difficult to paddle in . <p> A dam that feeds a power plant blocks the exit from Chiblow . A steel penstock ( 8 ft. dia. pipe ) runs from the dam through the old river channel and ends at a power plant about 500 m away . It looks like it would be possible to cross the dam and portage down the road on the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate blocking the road about halfway down . The actual portage is on the right side of the channel , and is marked along its path . It is rocky in some sections , and swampy and muddy in others . Although it is shown in the route description as 427 m , it seemed much longer . We did not pace it off to check the actual length . <p> A short section of river heads south from the dam and empties into High Lake . Skirting the west shore of High Lake , we arrived at the small chute emptying out of thelake . It is a short cascade with a ledge in the middle - definitely not runnable . There is a 50 m portage on the left side ( easy ) which goes over the bare rock and bypasses the chute . Rather than portage , we lined the canoes down the first porton of the chute and lifted them over the small ledge on the right side . We were then able to paddle out of the swift at the bottom into a small pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on the opposite side is the fourth portage . This trail bypasses a slopingfalls , one of the nices sights of the trip . The trail is only 46 m long , and fairly clear . It climbs for the first third , then drops down to canoe lake . There is a fair amount of clay , and it would probably be quite slippery when wet . There is a small campsite at the top of the hill that would probably hold two or three tents , but it was n't great . The flat rock at the bottom of the falls is a wonderful swimming and lunch spot . We took some time to sit in the falls and cool off . <p> The route continues southeast on Canoe Lake until portage No. 5 at White Falls . The portage begins at the end of Canoe Lake just past some buildings ( an auto wrecker ) . It has a sign marking the start and is to the right of the dam . The trail is a gradual downhill travel over flat , clear bedrock and gravel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is an artesian well just to the left side as you arrive at the road which runs continually with freezing cold water . A great opportunity to refill the water jugs . <p> The route continues east on Cataract Lake . Cataract is shallow and weedy along the shoreline with a lot of deadheads . Camping spots are nonexistent . We paddled to the east end of the lake to Cataract Falls . A narrow channel leads out of the lake toward the falls . There was one section of swift current , but the channel for the most part was slow-moving . We paddled down untill we were close to the lip of the falls then pulled out on the left side . Caution should be exercised if water levels are high - the falls has about a twenty foot drop . <p> The left side of the river is flat or gently sloping bedrock . We camped at this location . Setup was complete by 5:00 pm . Some members of the group camped right on the bedrock at the shoreline , and others took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas adjacent to the river . There is a rough trail from this location leading down to Hwy 557 that looks like it is used by four-wheel drive vehicles . <p> The falls is spectacular - a narrow chute which eventually turns a right angle and spills over a large surface of sloped bedrock before it flushes out of a narrow , rocky channel . <p> Day Three ( Sunday ) We broke camp at 9:00 am and began the day with the portage past Cascade Falls in a steady downpour . The portage is 340 m long and follows the four-wheel drive trail along the river to a point close to Hwy 557 . The end of the trail is an area of flat rock at the edge of the river very close to the highway bridge . <p> The section of the Blind River immediately following Cascade Falls is not very pretty - narrow and weedy , with a few dilapidated looking shacks and cottages . Just past the 30 km point of the route , the river empties into Lake Duborne . A short 2 km skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final section of the Blind River . The next 3 or 4 km was heavily populated , bringing us past homes and cottages , but the river gradually widened and became less-populated. the final couple of hours before the town of Blind River was through a wide , slow-moving section of the river with water lilies and weeds , with many huge white pine stumps protruding from the flooded landscape . <p> The trip ended just past the concrete highway bridge at the town of Blind River . We were out of the water by noon on Sunday . There is a boat launching ramp on the west side of the river with an open grassy area and road access for unloading canoes . <p> Richard Munn September 1996 <h> Trip Log - August 2006 <p> Our paddling group ( five couples this year ) was looking for a relaxed way to spend four days , and decided to revisit this route eleven years after we 'd first paddled it . <h> Day One - Thu Aug 10 <p> On the road from Sudbury at 7:30 am , and arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grey skies and rain , but the weather network promised sunshine by late morning .

Unfortunately , a brisk north wind had also come up . <p> On the water at 10:45 am , fighting for every metre of progress up the lake . Strong winds and 12 " to 18 " swells - at least no whitecaps . We stopped for a brief rest half way up the lake , then another stop for lunch at a rocky point just before swinging west on the lake . Chatted with the property owner , who wandered over from his place . He claimed that more paddlers used to do this route , but sees few of them any more . <p> Another 45 minutes of battling headwinds , but as we turned towards the westCothe lake narrowed , the winds abated somewhat . By the time we were approaching the mouth of the Blind River , we even had a bit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short section of the Blind River . We arrived at the control dam , and after a quick look decided once again to paddle up to the dam and lift over rather than using the longer portage on the right . A bit rocky just downstream of the dam - you have to be careful not to twist an ankle . <p> Paddled another short stretch of the river , and we arrived at Chiblow . The winds had thankfully died down a bit . <p> We paddled over to the island campsite where we had stayed before , and were encouraged because it looked vacant . As we got closer , however we noticed a single tent set up on the site - occupied by a couple of fishermen who were on the lake . We turned north and began to explore the north shore of the lake , checking out some promising looking points and clearings . <p> We found a site quickly , although it was n't exactly five star . The site was covered with thick moss and lichens , and the old firepit was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used in a while . It was getting on in the afternoon , so we decided to call it home . <p> Once we 'd cleaned the place up a bit and set everything up , we decided that it was actually pretty good . A path led off to the east and came out on a nice smooth rock " beach " with good swimming . <p> Put up the tents , had a swim ( warm water ) then supper and an evening campfire . <h> Day Two - Thu Aug 11 <h> Day Three - Thu Aug 12 <p> On the water about 8:45 am to begin our paddle south towards Cataract Falls , our planned campsite . Blue skies with not a cloud in sight once more . <p> Paddled across Chiblow and arrived at the power dam . The takeout is on the right side . Gave some thought to taking the portage on the right , but the trail that we found quickly worked its way out to the edge of a dangerous looking embankment . We decided to carry across the dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . The road leads to the powerhouse , and there 's an easy put in just beyond that building . <p> South on a small section of the river , and into High Lake . Just into High Lake , a set of rapids separated bya small pond heads off to the right . Apparently there 's a portage on the right side that bypasses the entire rapid/pond/rapid set , but it 's simpler to split it up . <p> At the first small rapid , there 's a portage on the left side , but it was simpler to just line / drag the boats down the right side of the chute . From that spot , it 's a short paddle across the pond to the portage on the left side of the small falls that drops down into the lake . This portage is a quick climb up , the a steep drop down to a flat rock shoreline . <p> As with our last trip , we stopped for lunch and a quick " whirlpool " in the falls .

We put in at Couchain Lake since the park told us that anything before that was impassable - likely due to beaver dams that no one had broken through lately . This was a great paddle going with the current and ended up being 25 km in total . The lakes are relatively shallow , and there is lots of habitation on them . The fun started at the end of Stevenson Lake . There are chutes there , some of which can be paddled down ( although expect a few scrapes ) , and one that should not be paddled .

I have learned a lot from him , particularly when it comes to correcting ourselves in rapids . We never make mistakes - only corrections J. We practice our white water skills on every outing and have been getting better . Both of us are comfortable living out of a pack . We have set up camp so many times together that there is not much communication needed ; it just comes together automatically . <p> Bob and Jim would be partners in the other canoe . They will use Jims Swift by Dumoine . A bit more capacity than the Mad River but less manoeuvrable in the rapids . I have known Jim through work for quite a few years but have never canoed with him ; Bob is a complete stranger . The four of us did get together for a three-day trip on the Spanish River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered so we were on our way . <p> The Gear <p> The Canoe <p> Rob and I would use my Mad River Freedom sixteen foot . After many trips together , Rob will finally agree that it is a better white water boat than his Swift Dumoine . Besides , Jim and Bob would be using their Dumoine and we needed one slightly smaller for " nesting " . The Dumoine measures sixteen foot four inches , the Mad River fifteen foot eleven inches . When the seats , thwart , yoke and decks were removed from the Dumoine , the Mad River fit inside like a glove . Flying in the Beaver from Canoe Frontier , the canoes would be nested and tied to one pontoon . The one drawback with the Mad River is the seating position . To take full advantage of its white water handling characteristics , the seats are close to the center yoke . It can make for cramped seating in the rear , especially with a large pack crammed in . The boat has been modified since I bought it six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends and the seats have been changed a few times , the latest with extra width front seats in both positions . I also drilled the hull of the boat to add nylon straps and quick release buckles to keep gear in place . Brass bolts , with a large diameter stainless fender washer to prevent it pulling through the ABS , attach to swivels and a " D " at eight points inside , about two inches above the loaded water line . Two sets of nylon webbing , crossed in an X , secure the pack and barrels . Both Rob and I are creatures of habit - everytime a pack is removed , after every portage no matter how calm the water ; the straps go back on . We know that in a light rollover with up to medium wave action , all the gear will remain in the overturned boat . We also know from experience that folded or pinned to a rock in violent water , not even the strapping will be enough . Everything has a breaking point . The bow and stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decks , and nylon rope loops attached for a carrying handle that doubles as an attachment point for the lining ropes . Both decks are drilled and have elastic shock cord attached for storage of these ropes . The ropes are half inch polypropylene , a loop spliced in one end , a snap ring spiced into the other . All these modifications have a price - weight . Factory weight for a Mad River Freedom sixteen foot is seventy-two pounds , not pleasant for a long portage . My canoe is now at a hefty eighty-two pounds . As it turns out , weight did not matter for this trip . At the last minute , Rob decided to remove the quick release buckles and straps from the barrel area . If we dumped , they would just float free . Only the pack would get tied in on this trip . <p> The Maps <p> A set of maps , one inch to the mile , was ordered from the Geraldton office of the Ministry of Natural Resources . For the cost of these maps and the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the whole river from start to finish and comprised seven blueprint-sized maps . A quick trip to the blueprint machine and we had another two good sets . The originals went back in the mailing tube for future use , if required . Maps the size of blueprints are cumbersome and would not last very long in a canoe . Too many days of water , then folding and unfolding . A cardboard template was used to cut the maps into pieces that would fit into an eleven inch by seventeen-inch laminating pouch . A half-inch overlap was left on the continuing edges in the series so a person would not be left wondering about the river when he came to the end of one map . A second set was copied so Jim and Bob could have their own . The detail on the maps is quite good . All the islands , channels , the route in the river and some campsites were all shown . Some rapids even had blow-ups with better details and portages marked . The only drawback was that the maps were totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell if you were looking at the river or shore . A week spent with pencil crayons colouring the land and water made all the difference in the world . For some reason , orange water and green land made a contrast that was easily discernable , even in the dark . The coloured maps were taped back to back and laminated in pairs . With holes punched and rings inserted , it was easy to flip from map one to two to three all the way up to map fourteen . Eventually , we had two sets of waterproof , coloured maps sized to fit in the map flap of a canoe pack . <p> The Tent <p> My Swallow by Marmot was made for this type of trip . It is a three plus season tent that has proved many times to be worth its outrageous price . Only a two-man size , it has a small footprint , full fly to ground level , a low profile for those windy nights and is the recommended yellow colour for easy spotting from the air . It has loops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing . The repair kit that came with it was added to the gear - miles from nowhere is not the place to learn how to mend nylon or repair a bent aluminum pole with duct tape . Jim and Bob would sleep in Jims relic from K-Mart , sometimes disguised as a blue haystack . <p> The Food <p> With the arrangements for both pairs proceeding in different cities , we decided that the food planning and preparation would be better left with the individual boats . Rob had the challenge of feeding us for sixteen days . This might not seem like much but we would be burning many calories , we wanted some kind of variety and were limited by the plane to a specific weight . Baked bread with peanut butter for lunch , soup and Kraft dinner for the nighttime meal , oatmeal with muffins for breakfast , then high energy mid morning and afternoon snacks all added up . We would be counting on a few meals of fish to supplement our resources . A 1500-ml Nalgene bottle of some kind of flavoured water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Liquids were decanted into Nalgene bottles of various sizes . A canoeist can not have too many Nalgene bottles ! When the bread mix was divided and individually packaged , the meals counted out and double-checked ; we had the big weigh in . Our total allowable weight for the four of us was three hundred pounds of gear , not including canoes . Our food weighed in at one ninety-five , Jim and Bobs at one ninety , both parties grossly overweight . This is when the extras got tossed . Food and clothing , bits of kit and anything else we figured could be spared ended up in a separate pile on the floor . Alcohol was exempt from being reduced ; we would carry more in our pockets if required . Down to the bare wire with only a few hours before train time , the weight was a more reasonable one hundred and sixty five pounds per twosome , but still slightly overweight . No more could be done . <p> The Packs <p> Robs big 120-liter canoe pack was stuffed with most of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with food but the tarp , saw , hatchet , stove , extra fuel , tent , cookset and whatever odds and ends would fit in the corners . A 50-liter mushroom barrel complete with harness carried the majority of the food . For the first few days , Big Bertha as we called it , was a real back breaker to get off the ground . My 55-liter Black Feather canoe barrel held all our spare clothes with the sleeping pads and bags . Rob and I both believe in barrels for flotation and to keep gear dry . Between the two of us we have fourteen ( only three went on this trip ) . A canoeist can not have too many barrels ! The only other packs in the boat were our personal daypacks that held raingear , a fleece jacket , and articles for use during the day . As my pack was larger , I also carried that days lunch . This was supposed to eliminate the need to get out " Big Bertha " at mid day . <p> The Clothing <p> I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Hunter on an irregular basis , trying to get a feel for the weather and water levels . We had a very dry spring and the local rivers were just a mass of boulders and gravel bars . Rob and I wanted to run as much white water as possible , but it looked like a low water year all over . In actuality , the Winisk was unusually high , but we did not realize this until only a week prior to departure . The weather was another unknown . Neither of us had been paddling this far north before , but we have paddled the local rivers around here when they are jammed with ice floes , so we were prepared for cold weather . With the cooling effect of Hudson Bay so close , snow has been reported during every month of the year . Both of us would wear and take the same basic outfits . For the day in the canoe : full set of polypropylene long underwear ( bottom and top ) nylon pants nylon shirt neoprene paddling boots fleece jacket in day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes included long flannel underwear , wool track pants , wool or synthetic sweater , a toque , gloves and spare fleece sweater . And hiking boots for dry land use . <p> The Rest <p> Detailing every article would be very time consuming and boring . Much more gear is necessary but may only receive mention in this list . The final word on gear : be prepared for any situation . Canoe repair kit , first aid kit , reflector oven , paddles and spares , bailer , sponge , lining ropes , tarp ropes , bungee cords , personal locator beacon ( borrowed ) , compass , bug dope , sunscreen , camera and film , binoculars , lip balm , matches , spare lighters , toilet kit , journal , PFDs and of course the one indispensable article : toilet paper . <p> The Trip <p> The Plan <p> As it worked out , this was the final plan : Via Rail from Sudbury to Savant Lake Truck from Savant Lake to Pickle Lake Flight with Canoe Frontier , Pickle Lake to Webequie Paddle 245 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pickle Lake Truck from Pickle Lake to Savant Lake Via Rail from Savant Lake to Sudbury We would be leaving Sudbury on August 5th and returning August 23rd . With the train and shuttle to Pickle , this would still leave fifteen days for the river portion of the trip . An outing to look for polar bears and whales was arranged with Sam Hunter , a native guide from Peawanuck . I was not going all that way and miss out on that . Who knows , I might never be back . A years worth of planning and preparation was finally coming to an end . <p> Day 01 August 05 <p> Jim and Bob drove up from Orillia and we all met at Robs house . Last minute preparations , last minute items added or subtracted , last minute purchases seemed to be driving us all to exasperation . Finally the truck was loaded with all our gear and we drove to the train station . A stop for fast food , which we ate at the station , and we were done . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage car , made sure they were all tagged and then waited to be seated . And received our first surprise about Vias wonderful Trans Canada service - the train was oversold and seats were not available ! That the tickets were purchased a month previously did not matter ; whoever got on the train first got the seats . We were out of luck , sort of . The conductor brought us up to the observation car ( this is not considered purchased seating ) and evicted four hapless travelers so we could take their seats . The train was scheduled for 7:10 pm but did not leave until 7:35 pm . The conductor must have had some pity on us because she brought us to her employees area so we could have a beer or two from the bar . Drinking is not permitted in the observation car . We settled down for the fourteen-hour trip to Savant Lake . Many people came to ask for the canoeists - where are you going ? what river ? that far north ? Regular seats became available about 1:30 am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the observation car . Tired as we were , it was almost impossible to get a good rest twisted into various shapes in the railroad seats . <p> Day 02 August 06 <p> Arrival in Savant was one hour late , but Jenn was waiting with the Canoe Frontier truck . After loading up we ate take out sandwiches in the truck on the drive to Pickle . The plane was not ready when we arrived at the terminal but we did not mind . We changed into paddling clothes , paid the remainder of the bill , had a beer or three from our cooler and posed for the obligatory departure picture by the pontoon . A change made in the last day was the substitution of the turbo Otter for our flight . Winisk Lake Camps had ordered twenty cases of beer and we would be riding with it to Webequie . No complaints on our part , we did not have to nest the canoes . Finally we were in the air and could see what kind of a landscape we were getting into . One word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bog , and swamp . Totally isolated . The flight itself was uneventful , right down to the smooth landing on the water . We pulled into a dock and were met by the local police constable and some helpers . The beer would spend the night locked in the jail and then be transported by freighter canoe to the camp . When I hopped off the pontoon onto the dock , a native man asked how far we were going , and was told all the way to the bay , he said it was an awful small boat to be trying that in . I did n't  know how much faith to put in his opinion . When the loaded police truck drove away , we were visited by about a dozen young native kids . They seemed either to speak only Cree or did not want to speak English . They were into everything , sitting in the canoes , looking at our gear , even making it plain that some would come with us .

After four hard miles we spotted an old campsite , left of Lynx Skin Channel , and pulled in . Camp was set , supper cooked and eaten in a frenzy . We had time to explore a bit on the trails around the campsite . It was filthy . Garbage was strewn around , plastic bags were in the trees , and more junk scattered as far as we walked . It was surprising as well as disappointing . Cool and overcast as darkness approached . A good possibility of rain .

We surmised it was the beer boat as there was a large pile of something in the center , covered with a tarp . The three natives in the boat waved as they went by . We still fought the headwind , pushing hard to get off the big water . No campsites could be seen on the lake . First fast water at Mile 9.5 . Portage on river left was just as shown on the map along with the large campsite above it . Scouted and decided to run the channel on river left .

High Rock Rapid , about Mile 11 , had big waves but no real action . Now we are making good time , fast water everywhere . Stop at small island north of Muskeg for a lunch of fresh bread and peanut butter . Sun is out , very bright , stripped down to waist , soaking in rays .

Bear Head Lake is all large waves , headwind terrible . We pull in at Bear Head Camp to inspect and rest . The cabins are open and have bunks , tables and benches . Were leaving and see a heavy wall of rain approaching up the lake . Change our mind and run for cover in the nearest cabin , decide to stay and freeload .

Oatmeal , crackers , peanut butter with coffee for breakfast . Clouds moving in , no wind yet . On water at 8 am , headwind starts immediately . Bear Head Rapids is first fast water today . It will be a rapid to remember for the rest of my life . Rocks and waves all over , with a few large islands thrown in to make things interesting . The river spread out in this area , like a small lake except it was all moving water . We stop at large island in center to scout and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fast we can not wade around . Bob and Jim run right side of island ( first mistake , should have gone left ) , some medium wave action . Rob and I watch for them to reappear but we can not see them . We think they are in trouble and go for right shore , they are actually OK and follow us thinking we know the route ( second mistake ) . After regrouping on rocks in middle of river , we set out again . Maps are in pack ( third mistake ) . I see what I think is an opening on river left and head for it . Jim and Bob follow ( fourth mistake ) slightly behind . The opening is actually most of the river water squeezing between two points on either shore . Approaching the opening we see the large waves ahead of us and finally realize we are heading for a monster rapid . We try a backferry to get to shore , still go forward . Then a quick spin and frontferry , straining at the paddles , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , backwards , accelerating beyond belief . We swing around at the last possible second . Nothing to do but brace and keep front of boat into waves . Difficult because therere coming from all directions . We go down the tongue and up the first wave , I have good view of far shore and nothing but row after row of huge waves between . I lay back so far I 'm almost under the barrel . Down into the trough and white water all around , over my head , all sides . Ca n't see anything except water and some sky above . Crest to trough about six feet . We take water but not as bad as I expected . Up again and another view of the far shore . Back down , surrounded by water . More water in boat . Up and down , up and down . Struggle to keep bow forward , bracing to keep upright , bouncing like a cork . Do not now how we made it through without turning over or swamping . Any rocks , even small ones , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Jim and Bob follow , fill to gunwales . We all make it to island and bail . From island we can see a log portage , on another channel more to river right , the one we should have taken . Someone suggests portaging back up the river and well run it again , this time with the others on shore taking pictures . We figure no one will believe us when we tell them the size of the waves . It did n't  take much to talk us out of a second attempt ; it would be pushing fate and luck too far . Rob catches seventeen-inch speckled trout in bay between Axe Hand and Round Stone Lakes , then a nice pickerel by small island in rapids , north end of Round Stone . We eat a late lunch , fish and soup on rocky island , good and stuffed . Finished at 2 pm . The beer canoe passed as we were having lunch , going back up river . Wind is bad after lunch ; we hug left shore of Hole and Goose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one home so we decide to stay and freeload again .

We seem to be slow this morning , feel tired . Hoping for a good day . Few swifts or mirror water to Mile 40 . Jim finds out he forgot his fishing rod at Winisk River Camp ; they turn back and battle current to go and get it . Rob and I say well drift , only paddle for control in the big waves . We kick back and catch some sun , eat trail mix and watch the eagles and hawks . Drift to First Big Rapid , about Mile 43 , look for portage , cant find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top to bottom .

Follow tongue into center , left at bend and then more left by boulder size of small car , right of grass island , catch the current on river left around bend to right . Fast water for two to three miles . Lunch on large flat rock above Portage Rapid at Mile 48.5 , river left . Good portage begins at large rock . Fall asleep in sun . Despite its name , we decide to run as much as possible . Very powerful rapid , sweeping bend to left , substantial drop . River right is impassable - rocks and large waves five to six feet for quarter mile . Big diagonal wave on river left . We line down first ledge , river left , past diagonal and push off from rocks . Large three-foot waves , take a little water over sides . Fast water constant for next few miles . Carryover at Mile 49 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

We keep this up all day , only one handed paddling to get into current , if needed . Even have lunch in the boats . Pass some large burned areas , some look very old , others only a few years . We stop to inspect native campsite marked on map , it does n't  exist . There is evidence , some rubber boots , but nothing else . More and more sand/clay banks , some thirty feet high . Start looking for a " Round Hill " marked on the map , can not pick it out or we passed it unknowingly . Caribou crossing river in front of us , he makes bank and is gone in two bounds . Quite large , brown with large rack . We paddle twenty minutes near end of day , make camp at small brook river right Mile 161 . River now runs east - west .

Jim comes back with pike , he throws back , and Rob scares up caribou just past mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More drifting , less wind today . Burn areas common . The wind in the burnt out trees is eerie , sound like a freeway . I fall asleep for an hour , laying back on PFD and barrel , feet stretched out on deck . Clouds move in , cools off , mist and drizzle start . Make Winino Creek , Mile 169 , at 12:30 pm . Rain picks up while soup is cooking . Rob catches speckled and large pike at creek . Jim and Rob clean while soup cooks , rain hard now , we eat soup and pack fish for supper . We head for nearest campsite . While paddling , I see a large wolf ( timber wolf maybe , it was huge ) on the bank and raise my voice to tell the others . The wolf stops and turns , stares at us for a while , then disappears into the bush . Ca n't find Indian site on next island as marked on map . Find good site on small island , west end of very large island , about Mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all soaked . Camp is at top of thirty-foot clay and gravel bank , scarred by ice . Carry gear , set tarps , make fire , gather firewood , set up tents . Rain stops as we set up . Jim and Bob decide to share some of their canned delicacies with us since Rob seems to be catching most of the fish . We have trout and pike fillets , canned potatoes with green and yellow canned beans . After supper its dry clothes and sit around the fire . I take out the Nalgene bottle of Drambuie and pass it around , and then take a picture as we fasten the plaque . Rob starts bread for tomorrow and we all comment about how good it smells , then start with remarks about bread for dessert . Bob does us in when he pulls out the jar of homemade berry jam . We eat all the bread even though its lunch tomorrow for Rob and I. After the bread , Rob makes muffins for breakfast , which we do n't  share . We stay up late , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of stimulating conversation . In bed at 11:30 pm . <p> Day 12 August 16 <p> Up late at 7:30 am . Oatmeal , muffins and coffee for breakfast . Lazy with no schedule . On water at 10:30 am . Slight headwind this morning so we have to paddle . No one feels like drifting anyway . Headwind turns strong , have to paddle hard . Lunch in the boats , pita bread , peanut butter and juice . Paddle hard in afternoon . Stop to fish at the creeks and brooks , Jim gets pike , Rob a pickerel . From distance , shore sometimes looks like rock under bushes , its actually roots uncovered by ice . More gravel shores , signs of ice , piles of rocks and mud sometimes two hundred feet or more from the water . We see a caribou on gravel bar ; he wades and jumps onto shore , shakes and stares at us . We stop and stare back , probably five minutes . He is brown with white chest and tail and a large rack . Finally he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim pickerel . They are afraid of fishing anymore , do n't  want to harm them unless we are eating them . Will be fish and Kraft Dinner for supper .

Rob repairs rod with duct tape ( good as new ) . Bob checks map , we have to figure out how to slow down some more . Lazy morning again . Rob does dishes , Bob packs tent , I write . Two large cranes fly over site , very noisy , loud honks . On water at 9:30 am . We drift again . Take small channel about Mile 204 , river right . It is about seventy feet across . We just get into channel and a caribou comes out of bush and down to shore . He trots down stream with us for about three hundred yards , looking at us occasionally . Large furry rack on this one . A bit ahead of us , he steps into channel , drinks and walks across and into bush . We drift , paddle and drift . Hot and sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sun . Channel twists and turns every which way . Steep gravel banks . After lunch we paddle a bit , we want to camp at Mile 210 . There is nothing there , soggy , wet and rocky . We keep going , searching . Shoreline changing again . More clay/sand/gravel banks , bluffs up to fifty feet high . Stop at gravel island Mile 214 . Scare up a large Peregrine Falcon as we pull in . Set up tent then bathe . Water very cold . I seem to have the night off as Rob is doing everything . Bob and Jim try and talk us into eating the bread for a snack again . Few bugs tonight , not enough for repellent . Lay by fire and watch northern lights . Great show tonight . <p> Day 14 August 18 <p> Up at 7:10 am . Blue skies , clear and sunny with cool south wind . Coffee and oatmeal . Today we will make Limestone Rapids . Nobody feels like drifting . We plan to get into camp early , wash up clothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above Limestone Rapids . Nothing where marked on map . Native camp on island by creek , Mile 224 and we go and explore . A native in powerboat pulls up and we talk for a while . He is the first person we have seen on the river . He is out fishing or hunting for caribou . We tell him about caribou in channel yesterday and he goes looking . We have lunch on shore by creek . I 'm laying on my back , watching river , and see a large osprey put on the brakes , plunge sixty feet into river to get a fish . Rob is walking on beach and pulls a rifle out of sand . It must be quite old , most of the wood is soft , the trigger mechanism is a mass of corroded steel and ice has bent the barrel . He is about to throw it back and I decide to keep it . This spot is not good for camp so we go from island to island looking for something half-decent . There is n't anything . We end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , Mile 230.5 , river left . As we are getting our canoes ready for first fast water in a week , a black bear comes out of bush opposite us , runs down bank and into river . It only gets in a few feet and is swept away by the current . We loose sight of him around the bend . I still wonder if we were saved from a close encounter by the river . Rob is in a playful mood as we enter a few small waves . He rocks the boat from front to back , finally getting the bow under and gives me a lap full of water with four inches in the bottom . We round bend and see the real waves , cant get out of them , by the time we are beside island , we are full . Its all we can do to move slowly to left , find a small spot of rock shore and pull in to bail . Only a little further and we are at the creek for our last campsite . High limestone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty feet high . The tents are pitched on a flat rock , held down with stones rather than pegs . Our cooksite is upriver a bit , near a natural stone bench we can sit on . The native we met earlier pulls in on his way downriver . He did n't  see any caribou . A freighter canoe comes up river and pulls in at mouth of creek to fish . We all bathe , try and clean up for the town tomorrow . Chili and pasta for supper , lots of it . Fire started , bread baking . We get a visit from a black fox ; he startles us when we notice him standing , staring at us , his eyes glowing red just outside the light from the fire . Pure black except some white on the tip of his tail . We sit around the fire and reminisce ; remember Bear Head ? , remember the speckled ? , remember this ? Partly cloudy , few stars . In bed at 11:00 pm . <p> Day 15 August 19 <p> Up at 7:10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , Peawanuck is only three hours away . Slight south wind , warming up quickly . Black bear comes for a visit while I am packing tent . Sits and watches for ten minutes then walks into bush . A few waves as we complete Limestone Rapids , then drift some more . Many sand/gravel bars , have to paddle to pick route , lots of meandering . Lunch in the boats . Can hear generators somewhere . Pull in at large dock , explore up road . Back in water , another five minutes and we pull in with native boats , can see native houses at top of bank . Jim and I go for a walk , ask for directions and eventually find Sam Hunter at band office . Back to the landing , another hundred yards through swift and we pull in at Sams place . Empty canoes and hump the gear to his back yard , make ourselves comfortable in his teepee . Lynne Cox from Canoe Frontier and her group show up within an hour . Large mound of gear from nine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teepee ( its not quite complete or waterproof ) , then supper at Sams house . Caribou stew , bannock , wild rice , and caribou tea from local plants . Back to teepee and make fire . Meet our guides for tomorrow , Maurice Mack and Dominik Hunter . In bed early . <p> Day 16 August 20 <p> Up early , supposed to leave at 8:00 am . Communal breakfast on table in yard . Walk to landing , leave at 9:10 am , three freighter canoes . Our group is with Maurice . As we head down river , we see natives in small canoe shoot a caribou at waters edge . Ca n't hear shot , just see muzzle flash and animal go down . Stop somewhere on a rock beach and search for fossils . Trees disappear shortly . River still moving fast , very broad . Winisk Village is only one house . A large cross marks the spot of the others before the ice . Pull in on grassy plain , eat caribou stew , and get ready for walk . Very hot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We trudge west , half mile from shore . Changes to tundra and mud flats . Climb stump and look for bear . Maurice spots one miles away , without binoculars , I can barely see it with them . Decide to swing west and come in downwind , try and find cover behind distant sand bar . It looks about thirty feet high . We slog around puddles and mud , generally keeping to our route . Sun out strong , start to sweat , take shirt off . Finally reach sand bar , its only three feet high , perception distorted . Crawl behind old logs ; see three polar bears ; a large sow and two cubs . We watch until they disappear into shimmer at shoreline . Long walk back to canoes . Very hot , could be thirty degrees . Sweat easily . Rest at beach , more natives have appeared , duck and goose hunting to start soon . Three tents and perhaps twenty natives . A little village . We take canoes into bay , dodge large rocks for three miles out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Belugas , Sam estimates at two hundred . Whales all over , spouts , white backs as they crest . Can see perfectly , only a few feet from boats . Drift in salt water , whales swim around us , heading for open water . We go past old Winisk station on way back . Huge buildings , still look in good shape from this distance . Our boat takes a different route back , we hit rock once . Stop to check black bear and then were back at the village for 9:00 pm . Late communal supper on table . Shower in Sams house . Fire and talk with the other party . Bernie Cox flies in and spends night ; well leave early . <p> Day 17 August 21 <p> Up early , snacks and rough pack for flight . All nine in van to airport , on plane by 7:00 am .

Train in on time at 9:00 pm . Stow gear in baggage car , find seats and stay up for a while . Jim and Bob decide to stay on train to Orillia . Sudbury at 2:00 pm , August 23 , then drive Rob home , finally pull in at home at 6:00 pm . Shower and in bed early , must go to work tomorrow . <p> Epilogue <p> The Rating <p> So , the trip itself was over but there were still things to do . After the gear was cleaned and stored there was the film to develop , distribute pictures , mount the rifle on a wall and plan the next adventure . And reminisce . I do n't  think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories . And transcribing this darn journal from my handwritten pages . Are there things we would do differently in hindsight ? You bet . Taking more time in the upper stretches of rapids and fast water is the major one . We could have spent more time fishing or even run some rapids twice or more . We did not expect the river to be as fast moving as it was in the lower part and were afraid of falling behind schedule . It may not always be like this ; we had very high water levels helping us along . The weight restriction for the flight also hindered our choice and amount of food . We did not need all we took but our resources were supplemented by lots of fish . Others may not be so lucky . Would I recommend this trip ? Absolutely . Most rapids would be runnable for most canoeists ; the big ones for those experienced in white water only . Portages are available for those that can not be run . The sights , the wildlife , the landscape were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate this trip as a ten out of ten . <p> The Plaque <p> Back on day eleven there was mention of a plaque . This was something I had made before leaving , sort of a memento of the trip . The plaque is a small piece of stainless steel plate ; about three inches by four inches , with all our names and the date burned into it by laser . It is fastened to a tree in the campsite so others who come after us can see that we were there . Our group shared all that this river had only for a short while . The memento of our journey is not permanent either . The ice is powerful in this section of river , even at the top of thirty-foot banks ; soil and trees have been pushed around in the spring thaw . Eventually , I suspect that the tree with the plaque will also be toppled and find its way down to the water . It will most likely rot or be crushed by ice over a few years , branches and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swept down the river . Someday , it may reach the salt water of the bay . And this would be appropriate . Paul Elson

We wanted to fish as much as possible and we did . This was an eary May trip and the weather was bad as was the fishing . Wildcat Lake was a disappointment for fishing , however , one of the more pretty lakes to spend time on . We were not in any hurry so we brought some extra gear . Most portages were done twice . Would like to have ran a few more of the rapids on the Sand River , but with a younger boy in the canoe and the fact that it was fiberglass , I was a little more cautious . Great time and would do it again .

The comment portage 90 meters to Daniels Lake from S Lake , leads you to believe you go down Daniels Creek , because there is no other place you can get to a spot where a 90 meter portage puts you into Daniels Lake . DO NOT try to go down Daniels Creek unless you like to pull your canoe hundreds of meters through swamp grass to get to a body of water you can see ahead . Once you get there , you will discover that at the far side of that small lake , the trail and creek disappear forever .

A few things to keep in mind though : - There is no government boat launch on Stormy Lake near Restoule PP . The only available place to leave your vehicle is managed by the park . They charge $15 per vehicle per night . - Fees have been introduced for canoeing in French River PP . You 'll have to purchase permit at one of the marinas on Hwy 69 - it 's $10 per person per night .

The sites we were able to see en route were only a small orange sign nailed to the tree , not sure what was a reasoning for choosing these sites - you were actually better off finding your own place better suited for campsites than the " designated " ones . - Beware of French River Supply Post canoe rental place .

We used a very old La Verendryes map and topo maps . This combination turned out to be sufficient . The parks map was given to us without a charge as they believe that money should n't be taken for such an old info . It was helpful , but inaccurate in some places . If you can not get the old map from the parks office any more , make sure to mark rapids and campsites on your topo at Le Domaine . Campsites are scarce , many are overgrown , and some are hard to find . So , be prepared . <p> Capitachouane is a beautiful river with clean water , picturesque hills and rocks , and many rapids . Most of the rapids on the river are in the section we did ( 27 rapids in total ) . Most of them are CII-CII+ and can be run if there is enough water . Due to low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rapids were technical , requiring precise maneuvering . In its upper portion , the river flows through a hilly and rocky terrain . Banks change to swampy , and terrain changes to relatively flat after 70-th km . <p> You can feel remoteness , but there are some hunting cabins on the route ( they were empty at that period of time though ) plus a couple of bush cottages on two lakes . We have seen only a couple of fishermen on Lac Peronne , no people further . By the way , fishing was exceptional . ( northern pike and pickerel ) . <p> Water was low , and there was no indication that the river gets very high at spring - the highest watermarks were about 1.5 ft. above water . Although we had to line our kayaks several times and hit rocks in many shallow rapids , it was n't a big problem for our kayaks tough plastic . In return we had almost no bugs and ENORMOUS amounts of blueberries . I have n't seen such abundance in my whole life . <p> We used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also do the shuttle yourself , as put in is mere 60km away from take out . You do n't  have to pay for camping permits for this route , because this part of the river is located outside of La Verendryes borders . We paid the fees at first , but got a refund on our way back ! If you continue past Island Chutes , pay only for the time you actually are inside the park . 134054 @qwx994054 <p> Driving directions <p> From Le Domain take HW 117 north . In about 45km there is a gravel road going to the right . There are following signs at the road beginning : " Chemin 29 est , Camachigama " , " Barrage de Barriere " and " Peer Horn Lodge 29km . " . The road is quite bumpy as all logging roads are in the area . After a 10 min. drive there is a fork , where a road to the left is road #292 . Take #292. 75km. later , at the road sign " 194km " , there is a road going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring you to the bridge at the Island Chutes ( I called them like that myself . There was no name on the map ) . Through clearing in the forest at your left just before the bridge , you will see an excellent campsite on high sandy bank overlooking the river at the take out point ( the old map says : old forest camp ) . You can park your cars around there . On your way to the take out , you cross three rivers/streams on your way . The first - with a rapid under the bridge ; the second - a creek , and the third - quite a big river ( it might be Capitachouane , as we had to cross it somewhere , but I am not sure ) . The bridge over Capitachouane is another possible take out . <p> To get to the put in at Lac Peronne , head back to the road #292 and turn right , driving in the same direction as you did before . Almost immediately ( 1.5km ) road #292 joins Chemin Chimo . Turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peronne . Its quite a big lake , and its the first big lake you will see on your right hand . You will see a bush cottage just off the road to the right just before the bridge . Right after the bridge , turn right to the put in , which is just a hundred meters away at the end of a portage . I have to say that there is actually no campsite at the put in . Its just a place where vehicles used to turn around . However , if after the bridge you turn left , the place there ( beginning of the portage ) is a little better , but you will have to carry all you gear to the put in later on . <p> Day 1 . August 24 <p> We departed from Toronto at 5:40 AM , because our shuttle was scheduled at 2 PM , and we did n't  want to be late . There were eight people with four double kayaks in our party . We made three short stops on our way and arrived to Le Domaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Domaine and drove behind the parks van to the put in ( stopping at the take out to live our cars ) . At the take out we were at 4:40 . We left our cars there and got shuttled to the put in , where we arrived at 5:50PM . Logging roads in and around la Verendrye are a special story . They get altered so often , that all maps showing them became inaccurate very quickly . Always check roads you need with the park office before you start driving on them . Parks staff always keeps the most recent version of the logging road map on a wall at the office in Le Domain . <p> Day 2 . August 25 <p> An overnight rain stopped about 8AM . Mix of sun and cloud . Cool . This day we left our campsite very late-the first loading to a kayak always takes more time . Gear loading into a kayak has to be quite sophisticated if you want to be able to load and unload relatively quickly - a drawback of all kayaks . This time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we attached to the top of our kayak ( you can see the bags on the pictures ) . It worked very well . We were able to take more gear , and to load/unload very fast . <p> We had our lunch at the marked group campsite at the narrow point on Lac Moore . Lots of space for tents , but there is a large cabin belonging to a hunting club . Weve seen no people around though . We left the point at 5PM . About 7km. downstream comes the first serious set of the rapids at the rivers elbow . It consists of 6 rapids ( CI , CII , CV , CII+ , CII and CII+ ) and is about 1.5km long . The campsite we planned to take was the next available site after the group campsite on Lac Moore - at the end of the set . There is a portage marked on the old map ( river right ) around the whole set , which is 1,2km long . It starts in a bay just before the beginning of the set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map shows that for 2/3 of the total length it uses an old logging road . If the water is low , I would recommend taking the portage. ( if you do n't  like to drag your canoe over the boulders in the stream . ) Please note that there are no portages around individual rapids in the set . <p> We decided to try to run what is possible to run , lining or carrying around the bad stuff instead of taking the portage ( this is our normal strategy , anyway ) . Water was low , and eventually we had to line/drag all but two rapids in the set . Our mistake was that we got to the set very late , and did n't  expect it to take us so much time to pass it . We had to camp on the right shore just before the fifth rapid in the total darkness There was no campsite at all , and we were very lucky to find a bumpy spot between trees and boulders to pitch our tents . So , our first day was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first rapid , CI , looks more like an introduction to what appeared to be a very shallow CII . We run this combination . Right after the CII , the river splits into two branches curving to the right , forming a big island . Neither topo , nor parks old map show this . The parks map shows CV with a 100m. portage at the left What we could see , was the beginning of a powerful rocky and messy chute to the right , and a narrow deep channel to the left . The banks there are rocky and very steep ; no trails . The left channel looked OK , and we lined it . The first part of the channel is very narrow ( 2m. wide ) with steep rocky walls . Further , it gets wider and shallower with numerous boulders in the stream . We had to drag our kayaks over boulders a couple of times here . The channels join together around here , but the big chute in the right channel can not be seen from here too . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river is squeezed between rocky shores . There are several big rocks in the flow , and a large boulder right at the center . This boulder in the strong current worried us a little , but we had no time for lining-it was getting darker with each and every minute . So , we run it . Two kayaks hit the boulder and spent some time sitting on it and trying to slip back to the free water , but eventually everyone managed to finish the rapid safely . ( We are lucky to have closed cockpits and skirts-water was running over the kayaks sitting on the boulder . ) The next rapid comes in 100m. downstream after a small quiet bay . But for us the day was over , because it was absolutely dark already . We started to scout both shores with flashlights in order to find any possible place to camp . We could n't find anything at first , but 10 minutes later found something very remotely resembling a flat surface among spruces and boulders with deep cracks between Relatively fresh bears marks at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day 3 . August 26 <p> Another overnight rain stopped right before dawn , and a crisp and warm sunny day was our award for yesterdays extreme . Rapid #5 ( CII ) , and #6(CII+) from the yesterdays set were waiting us ahead . CII was too shallow to run , and we lined this long rapid along the right shore . It ends just before a destroyed bridge . Here , at the right , is the take out for the portage around CII+ under the bridge . A decent group campsite is located here , where an old logging road ( end yesterdays 1,2km portage ) ends . CII+ was runable except the last shallow drop around a big boulder at the right shore . We run the first part , stopped and lined around the boulder . <p> A 2.5km long section of flat water begins after this rapid . The river is quite wide here and sometimes resembles a long lake . Hills around the river are getting steeper and stand closer to the water , promising more rapids . Four of the rapids ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . A couple of times we had to stop at the end of a rapid to drag kayaks over shallows . ( As we figured out later , this was the usual pattern for many rapids in the first part of the route : they started runable , but became very shallow at the end . ) Almost immediately after the last CI comes a 10ft. waterfall . The old map shows portages around the falls on either shore . We chose the right one . A take out is located almost at the falls lip . Caution ! Fast current ! An easy 30m portage brings to a pool below falls . We had lunch at this beautiful spot . <p> For the next 4km there is only one section of swift water to deal with . Then comes a long set of CII+ and CII . CII+ turned out to be very shallow , and we lined it . CII was run without problem . Soon comes another easy CII . After this rapid we had to find a campsite , which was marked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come before the next rapid , which was a mere 300m from the last one . We thoroughly scouted left shore between the rapids and could n't find any possible spot for a campsite . It was a surprise . We had not much time to think , as it was already 7PM , and the next marked campsite was in 3km downstream after two long CIIs . Because the site was clearly marked here , I decided to give it the last chance , and went upstream , searching for a campsite on the left shore . I paddled back to the previous rapid , but did n't  find anything . This meant we had to go further . I shouted my friends that they can start scouting the next rapid , and turned our kayak back . Paddling strong to save time , we almost got to the rapid when my wife noticed a narrow clearing in the dense forest on the right shore . We stopped and paddled back A campsite ! On the RIGHT shore ! We were so glad to find it ! It was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter of spruces with places for three tents . So , make a note that a campsite here is on the right shore just before the next CII . A good portage trail for the next CII started here too . It looked that someone cleared the trail recently . <p> Day 4 . August 27 <p> The day was sunny and warm . The first part of CII , which starts almost at the campsite , was lined . We run the second part stopping at the shallow end , and dragging kayaks over shallows to the deep water . The next CII was run ( CBR ) . The rapid was about 200m long . ( Actually , most of the rapids on the route were quite long ranging from 200 to 800 meters . ) Four more rapids follow soon one after another : A simple CI was hardly noticed ; CII was run after a check from the shore . The third one was a short but interesting technical CII , which we successfully run along the right shore ( CBR ) . The fourth one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by a short distance of flat water and the rapid itself . There is a very nice campsite for 2 tents just between the section of swift water and the rapid . The rapid was run ( CBR ) . There is a small grassy island right after the rapid . We decided to spend some time fishing here and caught three pikes and a pickerel within 20 minutes . <p> A campsite that had to be at the rivers elbow 3 km of flat water downstream was n't found . A first CII after the elbow looked more like a simple CI , and was run without stopping . After this rapid , the river flows in a narrow channel along a beautiful steep rocky wall on the left shore . We had our lunch here . <p> The next CII had a strong current with many rocks in the flow . We managed to run it successfully , but had to maneuver like crazy . Another CII follows soon . It was run without a check . After this rapid , there are only several sections of swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the route . The drop was very powerful and short with a calm pool below . It looked a little scary at first , but after a careful check , we figured out that it was clear of any boulders , and we had to deal only with the big volume . Everyone run it successfully , enjoying the fast ride . It was the only CIII on the route . It marked the end of the toughest part of the route . The next rapid will come only about 20km downstream . We took an excellent group campsite at the point on Lac Vimy 4km downstream from the CIII . <p> Day 5 . August 28 <p> We spent all the day at the campsite on Lac Vimy . We were fishing , swimming at the excellent sandy beach right at the point , tanning , eating blueberries and enjoying an exceptionally bright sunny day . This campsite is definitely the best on the route . <p> Day 6 . August 29 <p> We left the campsite at midday . YeaYou can see , we are not very " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer trip is usually the only long vacation we take , we try to get the most from it . So , we usually prefer to spend a couple of more days on a route to allow for our lazy pace and for an extra day for camping , wandering around in the bush , fishing etc . Therefore , number of days we spent on the route , can be divided by 1.5 or 2 to get it right for hard paddling lovers . <p> There is another marked group campsite just across the bay from the site we were camping on last night . We could see from the water that it is there , and it is probably big , as it is located at the end of a bush road at the edge of the bush . There was evidence that the site is used as a launching spot for boats . In about a mile from here , there is a cabin on the right shore where river flows out of Lac Moore . River here is shallow with sandy bottom , patches of grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but noticeable . <p> A nice group campsite with a sandy beach comes 0,5km before the bridge at Baie Du Portage ( another possible take out ) . We stopped here to eat blueberries . They were in such abundance , that we could n't believe our eyes . Another site is located just at the bridge . We did n't  check it out , but there is a lot of space beside the road . The next rapid comes in 3km. after Lac Loos . Its 600m long and quite interesting . On the old map it is shown as a combination of CII , CI , and CII+ . The river is quite wide here , and the old map shows a proposed way to run the rapid . Different sections of the same rapid shown on this sketch are rated differently . There is even a spot at the middle of the rapid , marked CIII . At our water levels the rapid was shallow and very technical . Overall , I would n't rate the whole set more than CII+ at that time . Nevertheless , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overgrown campsite for two tents on the right shore . The site is n't good , and we were glad that we spent a lay over day at Lac Moore instead of camping here as we planned before . We had a lunch here . <p> After the rapid , the river flows in swampy terrain forming meanders . The group campsite shown on the left shore in 3km downstream does n't  exist any more . The next one , for two tents , marked on the left shore , is overgrown ( if it was there at all ) . Its just an open spot at the sandy point , covered with high grass . The next marked campsite , on the left shore again , was n't found too . After that point , we started to look for a place that could become a campsite for us . Finally , we decided to camp on a sandy point where the next campsite ( one tent ) was shown . We pitched our tents on sand , and it turned out to be not that bad . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Day 7 . August 30 <p> The next rapid marked CII , turned out to be more like CI or even less . The next one is a long rapid marked CI at the abandoned road . There are two mistakes on the old map : its 350m instead of 700 , and it was CII+ , definitely not CI . May be its just due to low water , but I doubt that there can be such a big difference . There is a decent 500m portage trail that goes over a hill at the right shore . The trail passes through a nice group campsite . The drawback is that the site is located high above the water ( where the old road ends ) . The rapid was very technical and probably the most difficult on the route due to precise maneuvering required . CBR ! Three kayaks run it successfully , but one finished upside down .

There is a good campsite here . <p> The Mississagi River takes you to the town of Iron Bridge 19 km or to the town of Blind River , another 48 km . <p> The route takes you down the Little White River 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) where it joins the Mississagi River . The topography along the river ranges from low lying land to rolling hills and high rocky bluffs . The timber along the north end of the route is mainly pine and spruce . This gradually changes to a hardwood forest as you go down river . <p> The river has many fishing holes where brook and rainbow trout can be caught . People interested in nature photography will not only obtain excellent shots of scenery but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer , bear , beaver and many species of birds . <p> A minimum of three days should be allotted for the trip . If you plan to fish or spend any time exploring , more time should be allowed . <p> The nearest sources of supplies and canoes are Iron Bridge , Blind River and Elliot Lake . <p> The Boland River makes an excellent side trip . A trail on the right hand side of the Boland follows the river upstream for about 4 kilometers ( 2 1/2 miles ) to a set of rapids and falls . Fishermen should not neglect this opportunity to tangle with brook trout just below the falls . <p> This trip is not pleasant from mid-May til 2nd week of June due to the black flies . The Beaver Lodge is out of business although new owners live in the main house and are friendly . The trout fishing in larger pools is very good .

I only mention this because it means the lake is much more accessible to people who ignore rules than it looks on the map . As a result the campsite on the point opposite the portage is heavily used , littered with fish line , foam worm containers , old dishes and other garbage . 134045 @qwx994045 <p> Behind the campsite , near the privy , there is also a trail marked with small blue signs with a picture of a hiker .

@@107413175 @2813175/ 134052 @qwx994052 134053 @qwx994053 <h> MEC North Wind Tent <p> Thanks to the use of comparatively lightweight materials , the North Wind is pretty light as four-season tents go . When properly guyed-out , it stands up well to normal winter conditions ( for really brutal weather or sustained expedition-style use , we recommend the MEC Nunatak , which has a streamlined profile , and a stronger , heavier frame and fabric ) . One of the two integral vestibules is hooped for additional storage room and to serve as an airlock , in which to strip off boots and outer clothing prior to entering the main tent . The North Wind is comparatively cool on hot nights thanks to a large mesh inner front door and a zip-out mesh skylight . The floor on this model has now been upgraded to our awesome HT-Seal for longterm waterproofing . <p> My MEC North Wind tent was slightly different from the current model in that mine had only one vestibule rather than the current configuration which incorporates one large vestibule a second smaller one . After seven years of dependable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I needed and this one was the oldest and heaviest . I used this tent solo and with another person , in countless high-wind situations from the mountains and gulf coast of Texas to the shores of Lake Superior and it proved to be rock-solid even in the most outrageous situations . It performed well in the snow , though most of the time I was using it to extend the canoeing season well into the late fall and early spring . The ample guy points on the fly , the ability to fasten the fly to the poles at their mid-points , the extra tent pegs and guy wires all contribute toward the ability to brace this beast of a tent against even the most frightening tempest . This brings up the tent 's drawbacks . It is a very heavy tent by my ( perhaps overly critical ) estimation . The price of its bomb-proof sturdiness is heft and bulk . This tent does n't pack up nearly as small as a three-season tent . And my North Wind tent would often get a tad steamy during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second vestibule in the back of mine , wishing for better cross-ventilation , and it seems that MEC has since addressed this issue . In my opinion , this tent gets solid marks based on my 3+ season and occasional 4 season winter camping applications . Because this review is being posted on a canoeing web site , and most of us do n't take our boats out when the lakes are frozen over , I 'll assume that people reading this review will want a 3 season tent . If you plan to extend your season by starting earlier and going out well into the autumn you should expect the possibility of snow ( we had snow on our Algonquin trip on the May long weekend this year ) . The extra weight of the North Wind is the result of creature comforts and weather proof functionality , so in this application I give the North Wind 9 out 10 . If you never paddle when the temperature gets down to the single digits Celsius or below , save yourself the money and weight , and buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I agree that this is a very comfortable tent for two , with a small dog . OUr expedition Thermarests fill the tent lengthwise and leave enough room for gear . The large front vestibule is great for gear storage as is the smaller rear vestibule . Ventilation is good thanks to both front and rear mesh doors and overhead mesh vent . Gear loft is a must . One downside was the service we received when we took the tent back to the Toronto store to have some ziper pulls replaced . The customer service guy informed us we would need new zippers , at so much per foot . Cheaper to buy a new tent he said ! So my partner took the tent across the street to Europe Bound where the owner , replaced the pulls for about 25 or 30 bucks . The upside was that MEC HQ refunded the cost of the repair once I complained about it . <p> Heavy duty floor is fantastic , even with water pooled underneath . This 18,500mm coating will no longer be available next year due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too impressed with the exterior waterproof coating on the fly . Brand spanking new and I had fabric wetting on my first trip with moderate drizzle . MEC is going to replace the fly under warranty . An excellent tent for tall people due to long floor space . Two adults and a black lab on his own Thermorest fit easily with lots of room . This tent will keep you warm ! ventilation is not as good as in my lighter Eureka , but it 's worth it for the extra foul wether protection . The fly attachment in the footing grommets will sometimes pop out unless you have the tent fully staked with pegs.Not a light tent to carry in a pack . Ours went 10.9 lbs with MEC footprint and additional pegs . <p> Excellent tent and quality . I have used the tent in various conditions , from early spring , summer , to very late fall .

The series of lakes between Makobe and Elissa are not named on the maps and are identified by sequential number in the description below . <p> The first portage trail leaves from the end of a small bay at the southwest corner of the south bay of Makobe Lake . The 220 m ( 205 m ) trail is generally easy and leads to small , unnamed lake #1 . <p> Directly across this pond is the second portage trail , 80 m to unnamed lake #2 , an attractive , L-shaped lake with one campsite marked on the map . Tucked away at the end of a bay northeast from the point where the portage trail enters the lake , the campsite is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is small and has not seen use in recent years . <p> At the north end of this lake a 460 m portage trail leads to small , unnamed lake #3 . On the east side of this lake is a nice campsite which has room for several tents . <p> The 80 m portage out of this lake is a delightful walk through an open forest to unnamed lake #4 . The paddle down this lake is brief and the portage trail begins at the point where the outlet stream leaves the lake . The sign is hard to spot until you are nearly there . This 700 m ( 675 m ) trail is the longest portage on this route . There are several small hills and a boggy section in the middle . <p> The next lake , #5 , is directly south of Trethewey Lake , and there is a 320 m ( 305 m ) portage to the north into Trethewey . A small campsite is located on a point nearly across from the Trethewey portage and is a good place to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 250 m ) portage out of #5 is an easy , nearly level and attractive trail which leads to lake #6 , actually an annoying pond since the paddle is less than 50 m to the next trail , an easy 100 m ( 95 m ) . This trail leads to a small lake , #6 . After paddling a couple of minutes on this pond the portage trail is found at the outlet stream . On the topographic map a contour line ominously crosses this portage , and while this 180 m ( 175 m ) trail is generally level , near the end there is a steep descent with ball bearing-like gravel on the trail . Near the landing the stream cascades into the next lake , #7 . <p> Unnamed lake #7 is very short , and turns into a stream before the next portage . This 120 m ( 115 m ) trail was the only trail on this route where we did not see a portage sign . The trail is located on the right side just above a jam of logs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnamed lake on this route , #8 , is shallow and has lots of beaver activity . The 140 m ( 135 m ) portage trail begins below a beaver dam to the right of the outlet stream . <p> This portage trail leads to a rocky , fast running section of stream . At first it seemed that we would have an exciting , fast run to Elissa Lake , but the stream soon emerged from the forest into a marshland where it began to wind in endless horseshoe bends , pointing in all directions of the compass . Do not underestimate the amount of time this section of the route will take . While the map showed this portion of our route to be about 2.5 km the stream must travel at least 6 km because of the many turns and twists . Maneuvering the boat was complicated by the narrowness of the stream - less than one canoe length in width . There was enough volume and current in this section to float our canoe , however through many of the sharp turns and shallows it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and maneuver it . We were fortunate in that we only had to make one unexpected portage due to a downed tree . Having to face numerous trees across the stream could cause significant delays . <p> Once the winding stream section of this route has been reached there is one more portage shown on the canoe route map and in the guide book . It is marked as a 210 m ( 205 m ) , and takes you around a log jam and a small rapid . The portage trail passes over open country crossed by animal trails , and it would be possible to take a wrong turn if not paying attention . The trail is level and very easy , and it seemed quite a bit shorter , maybe only 100 m . Both the map and guidebook indicate a campsite on this portage trail , but we missed it . However because the land is level and open with few trees camp could be made in many places . <p> Below the portage the stream continues toward Elissa Lake at a fast pace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath the Gamble Lake Road through pipes which should be portaged . It appeared needlessly dangerous to try to run the canoe through one of the pipes , and there is no easy loading place in the swirling eddy at the downstream end of the pipes . Land on the right side just above the pipes and carry your canoe and packs up to the road . Cross over the pipes to the left side of the stream and look for a sloping gravel path which returns to the stream in calmer water below the pipes , a 20 m portage . It appears that ATV 's have used this road recently , but there were no signs of larger vehicles . An emergency campsite could be made on the little used road at this point or , to avoid any traffic that may come along , camp a few meters south ( left ) where the road to Gamble Lake forks from the gravel road . <p> After reloading from the road crossing it is just a short distance to Elissa Lake , whose open waters will seem a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx994045 <p> This route description is an expansion on Route 20 , " Makobe Lake , Trethewey Lake Links " , on page 116 in Canoeing , Kayaking , and Hiking Temagami ( Hap Wilson , 2004 ) , and is a summary of our experiences on this route in July , 2005 . <p> This route is useful for creating a link between the North Lady Evelyn River and the Makobe/Banks Lake area and , when combined with the Grays River , will make an good loop trip . Part of this route can be used in conjunction with the route which enters/leaves Trethewey Lake from the north . <p> Between Makobe and Elissa Lakes the route consists of standard portaging interspersed with small lake padding , and at the west end there is a substantial stretch of winding stream to negotiate . Because the stream drains into the North Lady Evelyn River watershed it is best to take this route from east to west . The stream has quite a bit of current , and we were able to paddle much of the way , however less water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake would be difficult and involve many km of wading . <p> Trails were generally in good shape and we had to clear only two minor blow downs . It appeared that the trails on this route had been maintained in 2004 . Few parties had preceded us on this route in 2005 . Moose are the primary users of these portages , and tracks were apparent on nearly every trail . Because the route sees little use there were not the dual identifiers of portage landings - the small sign and the beaten down area marking the trail , but with only one exception we found all portage trails on this route marked with the standard portage sign at both ends . Had there not been portage trail signs we would have spent much more time looking for each trail as some were no more obvious than moose or beaver paths that head into the bush , and we found ourselves wishing that the signs were larger and easier to spot . <p> The stream section of this route is affected by the level of water . Local people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as having been especially dry , though some people mentioned that the lakes were low . The weather in this area had been recently hot and dry , and a fire ban was placed in effect while we were out . The stream on this route held enough water for us to complete the route in mid July . Spring or early summer water levels would make the trip easier . 
@@107413196 @2813196/ <p> Hi , I 'd like to do a camping trip to Lingham but have never been there . Can anyone let me know if you can get a car or pick up truck in to the south end ? How long is the portage from the north end ? Can you get to the north by car ? Would you need a 4x4 for either access ? Thanks in advance . <p> My sister owns some property near there . The last time I spoke to her husband about it he mentioned that you do NOT want to take your car down that road . There is a local , I do n't know who but will try to find out , who uses his tractor to get through . It 's a complete bog in some places . It would take several hours to portage it . <p> Drive up highway 62 towards Bancroft . An old logging road named Scootamatta Rd will take you into the bush . After a half hour drive there will be a major right hand turn ( forget all the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line ( about 10 minutes after ) . Take that right hand turn and drive until you ca n't drive any more . You will cross some small bridges on the way . At the end there is a hidden right hand turn that is very steep and is mostly a rock face . You can park your vehicle up there ( if you can get up there ) . Take the trail about 1 mile down to the Black River and drop in your canoe . You have just reached the north east tip of the lake . There are hundreds of small islands you can paddle to for a weekend ( or week ) of absolute fishing heaven . This alternate route is quite an adventure and is used by guides to bring in their guests . It 's not for softies . <p> The Hell access , is not an option , Infact it 's quite out of the way . The main trail in from the south , is still not passible by car , but its not nearly like the " Hell trail " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April , only to be stranded overnight at hunting camps due to broken Jeeps and rising water from melting snow and heavy rain ) You can take a stock 4x4 or maybe a 2wd truck into the lake from the south , as long as you stay out of the deap holes ( ground clearance is the big issue ) . Our club did a cleanup run a few years back where 2 stock cherokees made it all the way without problems . WIth that being said , I recently heard they were doing work on the damn in there and the south road was like a " highway " I ca n't say either way , but I still have my doubts of any cars making it in without damage . Directions from Madoc , head North up Cooper road past the Madoc arena , about 20mins and turn right on Lingham lake road . Follow all the way to the hydro line and there is a Parking area where the trail starts from there . Good luck ! <p> We drove up on Friday night and drove out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Weslemkoon/Skootamata Lake Roads right to the very end in the dark . We took my little Mazda Protege and made it all the way in and back with no mishaps . We camped beside the car Friday night as we had n't found the little side track that leads to the parking area . The next morning , we bushwacked straight ino the lake as we hadn'r found the portage yet to look it over . It was a very nice first impression ! After hiking back out to the car , pumping some water from the ditch , we found the trail that leads to the Black River access to the lake . We even got the car to the top of the hill to the official parking pad for the Lake ! We saw a couple of instances of bearscht ( like borscht , only different ) in the woods while bushwacking . We paddled out into the lake through 6-8 " of water for the first kilometer or two and then began exploring the islands . Well , there are dozens or hundreds of them ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddle . We immediately began discovering el primo after el primo campsite ... all of which were available ( except 2 ) , then spent most of the day exploring the lake and taking photos . The morning after broke with a dead calm which lasted til 11:00AM . We spent the morning just paddling all around every conceivable island and bay we could find taking photos and watching the hords of migrating birds . Words ca n't describe the beuty of Sunday morning . Here are some photos which really tell a better story ! <p> I stopped going to Lingham about 6 years ago . The condition of the campsites was just too depressing to me . I 've paddled alot of places and never seen as much human shit laying around as on Lingham . Do n't get me wrong .... I love to fish as much as most people , but the boat fishing crowd was destroying Lingham . All the campsites were littered with huge piles of garbage to compliment the huge piles of excrement . <p> Dispite the abuse it was ( and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing has always been amazing , despite the heavy pressure . <p> I hope the conditions have improved somewhat over last few years . Maybe I 'll give the lake another try ? <p> Hi Blair , Good to hear from you again . I was pleased by the relative lack of garbage in there on this trip . There were a few left behind things like a couple of bags of potatoes and a milk and water jug , but most of the campsites were quite clean ! There are biffy 's on most islands and no misplaced feces . I would n't hesitate to bring my wife and kids in there . Hopefully that is an indicator of improved education on the defender 's parts . <h> Who is online <p> Users browsing this forum : post attachments in this forum

@@107413199 @2813199/ 134053 @qwx994053 <h> Packing and Waterproofing <p> Ask any paddler about the correct way to pack gear for a canoe trip , you 'll probably hear about that paddlers ' perfect ' system . They have everything set up so that each piece of gear is at their fingertips and everything is safely waterproofed in case of a dunking . The number of perfect packing systems matches the number of paddlers . Everyone who participates in canoe tripping has a system that they have developed and refined over the years . they are used to that system , so it really is " perfect " for them . <p> Keep in mind that gear organization is exactly that - a system based upon personal preference . Whatever works for us is fine providing that two criteria are met : <p> There is n't a lot of loose gear rolling around the canoe <p> Any gear which should be kept dry is completely and absolutely waterproofed <p> Beyond these two guidelines , we can all feel free to develop a system that will allow us to lecture other paddlers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches to waterproofing gear : <p> To use waterproof packs and rely on them to protect our gear <p> To waterproof gear before it goes into packs <p> There are some very good waterproof packs on the market . One word of caution , though . Waterproof packs have two possible weak spots - the fabric they are made of , and the closure system . Waterproof fabrics such as coated nylon and neoprene can develop leaks from wear and tear ; and closures can fail . Buckles can pop open , and roll-top seals can leak . However , we have had good luck with waterproof packs like the " Seal " packs . <p> Waterproofing gear before it goes into packs is obviously a necessity if we are using canvas or other non-waterproof packs . It is also not a bad idea for those using " waterproof " packs if we want to be cautious about the keeping our gear dry . If there is one are of tripping which deserves caution and attention , it is waterproofing of equipment . There is nothing worse than a wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterproofing is a simple process . Any pack can be waterproofed by putting a plastic or nylon liner inside it . What can you get these liners ? We simply head over to our local janitorial supply company and buy some heavy 6 mil garbage bags . These bags are much bigger than regular plastic garbage bags and extremely tough . The top can be sealed by twisting it , folding it over then wrapping it with a heavy elastic or piece of bungee cord . Inside this bag , goes our gear , also waterproofed . In other words , clothing and sleeping bags are additionally waterproofed in small river bags or regular garbage bags before they go into the lined pack . If you want a permanent solution to pack waterproofing , you can also purchase waterproof pack liners from companies like Ostrom Outdoors . <p> Keep in mind that some gear simply does not require waterproofing . It does n't really matter if pots , pans , cutlery , rain tarps and ropes get a little wet . <p> The list that follows is one suggestion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and modify it .

@@107413203 @2813203/ <p> We were driving past the Holy Cow Canoe factory the other day and decided to stop in and check it out ( we 'd never seen it before and knew little about the brand except for a few references to the name now and then ) . Anyway , we ended up taking an improvised tour of the factory and store and we were really impressed . Goolum ( sp ? ) was very patient even though they were officially closed and showed us everything from the moulds to the rolls of kevlar , to the custom painted cow canoes . His hospitality and attitude was great . I 'd love to buy from them but ... does anyone here own a Holy Cow canoe ? The have a 52 lb ( i think that was the weight ? ) Kevlar Prospector 16 ' 6 " that looks great but I 'd like to hear from current owners . Its use : flatwater trips from 3-10 days , some decent paced moving water but nothing major , and finally , long portages ( so I 'm also particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have with it ( the stock yokes looked to be a little shallow for my liking ) . Oh , also , I 'm thinking about the ash trim as opposed to the stock plastic . Is it worth the extra $350.00 in terms of craftmanship ? <p> Dang , I hoped you were going to tell us about the quality of these canoes . Most of the ones I 've seen on Ebay have had keels ( or atleast what appear to be keels ) . That alone eliminates them from my list of desireable canoes , but ..... I 've yet to hear of anyone that owns one , and would love to hear what folks say about them . <p> I did alot of research on this when I was shopping for a boat after I saw them on Ebay and found very little info on them . They look ok for the money , pknoerr , I have n't seen one with out a keel yet . JMO is that they look like a decent , cheap entry level canoe , where else can you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about getting one I , d get one off ebay as they seem to go for alot less than the web page prices and you can still add options . Let us know about it if you get one . <p> Thanks for the comments . A few comments on the comments ... As far as the keel goes , there was only one canoe there w/out a keel and it looked like a solo racing canoe with little room for gear . The rest of the models had either significantly large keels or very shallow ones . I did n't see any prospectors with flat bottoms . About the ebay thing ... right now they are having their end of season sale and the prices are currently better than the 16 foot Prospector that they have on Ebay . I think that the take away price was about $1500.00 ( with plastic gunwales ) . I know that their prices are significantly higher during the summer . Personally , I can live with a shallow keel , but , still wondering about quality and durability . <p> I probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper Prospector it has or appears to have : <p> -Stems that do not recurve -too little rocker -It does not carry as much volume torwards the front and rear of the boat , making it perhaps faster but not as good in whitewater and able to cary a smaller volume . <p> Also The yoke looks weak to me , and as said above , there is a keel <p> I would bring a scale to see if the weight is as stated because I do not think that it is a Prospector as stated <p> We purchased our " Holy Cow " 16.6 Prospector canoe on e-bay over a year ago . We too were impressed with these folks , they were friendly and easy going , which made it easy for me and my wife to ask questions and we got a chance to see them putting together one of their canoes which was fun for our kids . I recently went back to upgrade the yoke ( which incidentally was my only gripe with the canoe ) and spoke with the production manager ( Stu ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were located in Guelph a number of years back . I was impressed when I bought the canoe , and am still very impressed with the level of service these guys give . My " Holy Cow Canoe " performs flawlessly , it tracks straight as an arrow , and is very stable . I have paddled this canoe both solo , and loaded with the family and enough gear for an extended 3 day trips and she performed flawlessly everytime . I also have the 16 ' Langford Prospector ( with no Keel , which I paid a lot more ) and if you ask my opinion I prefer the " Keeled " Holy Cow which offers a big benefit to me. ( and the 100lbs dog ) I do not worry about the wind picking up , and have no worry about taking my kids or the dog with me . The bad would be as stated by " Grinder " the standard yoke is not much to carry a 16.6 ' canoe with . Overall , I am more than impressed with this canoe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 times what my Langford Prospector is , and I would recommend " Holy Cow Canoe " to anyone . <p> I would say that if you are happy with the the way it performs , go for it . My $2500 Langford is developing cracks in the gel coat after one year of moderate use . Lifetime warranty ? I doubt it . They will say I drpped it or a I tied it down too tight . There is nothing wrong with it in terms of performance , just getting cracks . <p> Go talk to Jay at Muskoka Paddle Shack about his Alchemist Canoes . That is going to be my next canoe . Looks good and claims to have a more durable gel coat . <p> I recently saw the 15 ' prospector and the honkin ' big keel . It 's huge . The owner crowed about tracking on lakes and griped about cornering down meanders . <p> Their Silvercreek line does n't have the keel , it does cost more . <p> For their features and prices , they look like fine entry level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe beef up keel where it 's going to grind on shore . <p> While talking to HC on the phone , I found them very eager and helpful . Right up to the point where I wanted to test paddle one . Nope , not possible . They do n't have water at the factory . The same canoes offered under the HC name are also available under other names , other retaillers . The guy explained that most of the canoes they make are made for other retaillers and not given the Holy Cow name . In fact , a lot of the ones that get the HC name are blemishes they could n't ship to their buyer . The contract does n't allow HC to point me towards a retailler that might be set up for a test paddle . <p> Is it worth the drive to Acton ?

@@107413210 @2813210/ 134052 @qwx994052 134053 @qwx994053 <h> Canoeing with Kids <h> Special Considerations <p> The most important consideration is that the trip has to be fun - and fun from a kid 's perspective . As adults , were sometimes willing to put up with a bit of adversity in order to get into that special lake or river ; or reach that favourite campsite . Kids will neither appreciate nor understand this type of tradeoff . They live for the moment and if that moment happens to be miserable , theyll be miserable too . You 're never going to be able to use adult logic to convince a child that a long , buggy day was worth it because you 've reached your favourite campsite . <p> Daily travelling distances have to be scaled back dramatically . If your typical paddling day is 20 km , consider 5 8 km as a good distance for paddling with children . Kids may enjoy the novelty of riding in and paddling a canoe , but they also want and need time on dry land to explore and play . Frequent rest stops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of the day when tripping with kids . <h> Planning <p> The planning and preparation process is an enjoyable part of any trip , and that 's particularly so when it 's a trip involving kids . Let your child be part of this planning process . It will heighten the level of anticipation ; and allow them to feel that they 've had an important role in the process . <p> This includes menu planning and packing lists . Help the child understand that everything has to be planned out in some detail what they 're going to eat , drink , wear , carry and use . Even a child should know that a canoe trip is different than going outside to play . If something gets forgotten , neither you or they are going to be able to run home to get it . <p> Show your child the route on the map and explain to them where you 're going to be going , what the scenery will look like and where youre staying for the night . Even a small child can have a surprisingly good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture " of the route . Point out that the little triangles are campsites , and that the line across the river will be a rapid . Show them the spots that the contour lines indicate a big hill or a cliff ; and the symbols that indicate a marshy section . <p> Allow your child to do their own packing . For a small child , this may only be a matter of putting a storybook , their teddy bear , their GORP and water bottle into their little daypack . Its still important . You can point out things like " what would happen to your bear if your pack fell in the water ? " and recommend that maybe the bear might be safer inside a Ziploc bag . <p> Older children are perfectly capable of packing from a list that you have made . Allow kids to gather their own clothing , raingear and footwear and after checking these items against the packing list yourself , help the child pack them . <h> Equipment <p> Good kids equipment is just as important as good equipment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we probably have good clothing , a quality mattress and sleeping bag and adequate raingear . The same may not hold true for the children . If a quality , warm sleeping bag is necessary for you , then it is for the kids too . Those little cotton-covered bags with the pictures of Barbie or Pokemon are fine for sleepovers at a friends house , but not so great during a cold snap on a canoe trip . <p> Putting a child into an adult-sized bag ( even a quality one ) may not be the best idea either . Sleeping bags do n't  generate any warmth they simply hold in the heat that our bodies generate . A small child may not be able to generate enough heat to warm up the inside of a huge adult-sized sleeping bag , and regardless of the rating they may feel cold at night . Be sure that the temperature rating of the bag matches the worst expected weather ; and that the bag is properly sized for the child . <p> A good PFD is also essential . For small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that you can retrieve a child that slips into the water or falls out of the canoe . It should also have a crotch strap so that when you pull on the neck loop you do n't  end up with an empty PFD in your hand and a kid still in the water . <p> Each child should have their own daypack to carry their personal gear . This pack does n't  have to hold all of their clothing just their essentials that they 're going to need during the day . Kids feel much more independent and grown up if they 're carrying their own sunscreen , GORP and toys in their own pack . They should also be responsible for getting this pack across the portage . As children get older and able to carry more weight , the pack size can be increased so that they 're carrying more of their own gear . <p> A good piece of equipment for the daypack is an inexpensive compass . As you travel , you can tell the child " we 've got to paddle to the north end of the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find which way north is . Its not only fun for the child , but a way of beginning to establish some type of navigation sense and familiarity with compass directions . Explain about directions and how a compass works . Ask them early in the afternoon to predict where the sun will sink below the horizon based on the fact that the sun sets in the west . <p> Of course , each kid has to have his or her own flashlight or headlamp . The ability to independently light up the inside of the tent at night is critical , and making shadow-figures is quite cool , too . With the heavy use that kids flashlights get , an LED model with super-long battery life is a good idea . <p> Children should carry a whistle at all times . This whistle should be clipped to a belt loop with a carabiner or otherwise fastened to the kid . Watch out for and avoid neck strings that can get caught on branches or underbrush . Children can wander , and they should know that the moment they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how to get back , they should stop where they are and use the whistle to signal for help . They should also recognize the importance of ONLY using the whistle for this purpose . The whistle is not a toy , and must not be used as a noisemaker only to sound those three blasts that signal a problem . Let them try this three-blast signal in the living room at home as many times as it takes to get it out of their system and to ensure that their understanding of the signal is the same as your expectation of what it will sound like . After that , they have to know that blowing the whistle is a no-no unless they 're seriously in trouble or lost . <h> Toys <p> People seem to be of two different mindsets when it comes to bringing toys . Some feel that a little bag of toys can provide a valuable diversion ; others feel that children can create their own playthings with sticks , stones , pinecones and other treasures they find . <p> Whatever approach you take , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket . It provides some degree of continuity and comfort in what may be a brand new environment for kids . A favourite storybook can be a godsend also . When my guys were little , they wanted the Pokey Little Puppy and the Cat in the Hat as a bedtime story every single night . There 's no reason not to carry out that tradition while you 're in the tent . Books can also be a lifesaver during extended periods of rain , when kids start to get cabin fever . <p> A kid-sized mask and snorkel or swimming goggles can be a lot of fun for finding those special treasures on the lake bottom too . <h> While Youre Paddling <p> Again , its worth reinforcing the guiding principle that children have limited attention spans , and that their tolerance for a long paddling day will be low . Unless you want to paddle along with a whining child asking " are we almost there ? " you 're going to have to scale back your normal paddling day dramatically . <p> Sitting on the cold , hard hull of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of cushioning , perhaps a closed-cell foam pad and a day pack to lean against . Children should be encouraged to paddle . Small paddles are inexpensive and readily available . It may be worth tying the paddle off with a piece of cord to the thwart or portage yoke so that you are n't  stopping to retrieve a dropped paddle every ten minutes . <p> For the most part , kids are content to watch the scenery go by , grab lily pads , paddle , drag their hands in the water and ask incessant questions . Stop for frequent breaks to have a pee and explore . Although we often are running on some type of schedule , its important to have some flexibility and allow time for berry picking , frog catching , plant identification and general exploration . <h> Activities <p> Most people find that planned activities are unnecessary . There likely wont be enough daylight hours to gather every pinecone , chase every chipmunk and explore every nook and cranny on the campsite . Although feeding wild animals is n't generally a good idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably going to find that you 're sharing the site with one or more very tame squirrels or chipmunks . Having a supply of peanuts or other nuts along can provide hours of diversion as the kids watch these critters return again and again for a handful of nuts . <p> A little net can provide lots of entertainment as the kids scout the shoreline for minnows , frogs and crayfish . Field guides to birds , plants and reptiles can provide entertainment . Encourage your child to keep a list of the birds theyve seen ; or collect as many different leaves as they can and try to identify them . <p> Keep a trip journal . Itll be a priceless treasure in years to come . If your child is too young to record their thoughts in writing , let them draw pictures and dictate their impressions of the canoe trip to you so that you can record the stories for them . <h> Bug Protection <p> Adults may have the fortitude to tolerate insects children may or may not . If a child is having problems with mosquitoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , itchy kid up tossing , turning and crying in the tent at night . A kid-sized bug jacket ( inexpensive and easy to find ) is a great option . Make sure they have a hat with a brim that will keep the mesh away from their face . Insect repellent is a must also . Remember that strong DEET-based sprays or lotion are not recommended for children on an ongoing basis . There are repellents with milder concentrations of DEET , or citronella-based lotions available . Putting repellant on cuffs , pant hems and hat brims is a good option if you do n't  want to apply sprays directly to young , sensitive skin . <p> During the peak ( evening ) bug hours , it may be necessary to retreat into the tent for story time or quiet playtime . A bug tent is probably a worthwhile investment if you 're going to be doing any amount of tripping with kids . There are some reasonably lightweight and portable models available . <p> " Afterbite " pens that help relieve the itch of insect bites are readily available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varies from person to person , but they may be worth a try for treating the inevitable bites that occur . A last resort may have to be a child-appropriate dose of an antihistamine , either in ointment form or taken orally . <h> Food <p> A child brought out into the wilderness environment has enough changes to adapt to without having to deal with a strange new menu . A canoe trip ( particularly a first canoe trip ) is n't the time to see if your child likes dehydrated food or lentil stews . Sticking to the tried and true familiar items that kids like at home will probably work best . <p> Is your kid a Kraft Dinner or hot dog lover ? You may as well plan on bringing them along . As adults , we can cope just fine with a complete new way of eating children may not . A box of Cheerios may not be traditional tripping food , but if that 's the breakfast of choice at home , it may be best to carry it along . <p> Stick to foods that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshmallows for the campfire too ! This is n't to say that there is n't room for creativity . Kids love cooking and eating anything that 's prepared on a campfire . Try wrapping bannock around a stick and letting the child cook it over the coals . <p> Frequent and readily available snacks are a must . Allow the child to carry GORP , granola bars and a drinking bottle in their day pack .

Weather was unseasonably warm ( gorgeous ) and water levels were fairly low . <p> Day 1 - Thursday September 5 Left Sudbury and drove south to the put-in on Dry Pine Bay . First navigational screw-up of the trip . We were supposed to be meeting at Loons Landing , a lodge on Dry Pine Bay . Unfortunately , the crew in the other car had n't  had sufficient coffee to wake up , and only heard the " Dry Pine " part of the instructions . Had they followed us , they would have been fine , but they took a " short cut " and disappeared . Our vehicle was pulling the canoe trailer , so when we got to the lodge , we registered and waited for the other car . No sign of them , so we took the canoes down to the lake . Still no sign , so we hauled all of the gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how slowly they were driving they ca n't be 45 minutes behind us , so we started phoning home , various lodges and driving around to try and find them . Located them sitting with blank looks on their faces at " Dry Pine Resort " - there is still strong suspicion among some of our members that it was a ploy to avoid unloading the gear . <p> In spite of the delay , we were still on the water by 9:30 am . Visibility was approximately 100 m in the thick fog . Since Dry Pine Bay was over 1 km across , we obviously could n't see the other side , so we set off on a compass bearing of 30 degrees towards Meshaw Falls . Short ( 100 m ) portage around the right side of the falls that begins at the beach of Meshaw Cottages . The trail goes up along a road , and puts back in just above the falls . The most difficult thing about the portage was finding a good place to put back in - with the water level being low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Found one good spot , but it was already occupied by a large swarm of wasps that chased us out of there . Settle for second best put-in , and were back on the water . <p> Paddled north through Eighteen Mile Bay then headed east onto the French River Main Channel , paddling against the direction of flow . Not many people out on the water , but there are a lot of cottages in the area . Continued east to the next portage around a small rapid ( UTM ref. 376004 ) . It could probably have been lined , but there was a simple 50 m portage to the left , and seeing as we were stopping for lunch anyway , we hauled the canoes and gear out of the water . Putting in after lunch at the head of the rapid into the swift water - my paddle snapped clean in half , leaving me looking at a shaft in my hands , a blade floating down the rapid , and a very busy bow paddler ahead of me trying to stop us from running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore , and we gradually made some progress upstream away from the rapid . <p> Passed under a small bridge about 1 km later - hardly looked like a riffle under the bridge , but we had to paddle like crazy to get through it . I understand why they used to pole upstream instead of paddling through stuff like this . From this point , the river widened out into more of a lake than a river , and stayed that way for the next 5 or 6 km . Lots of cottages - too busy for my liking . <p> the weather was extremely hot - close to 30 degrees C. In spite of the short and simple paddling day , we were all drained and exhausted . There were a few campsites in the stretch just past Baie Daoust , but one was occupied and and some of the others were too small . We made camp on the south ( right ) shore of the river ( UTM ref. 487034 ) . Quite a nice site . We set up camp , had a swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day 2 - Friday September 6 On the water by 9:00 am to continue working our way upstream on the Main Channel . First rapid 3 or 4 km later ( Cedar Rapids ) . It is a simple P 60 m L , but we chose to line it . Just upstream is the second part of Cedar Rapids . This second part is actually a double rapid . For the first part , the river splits around a small island . We lifted over the first part of this island and put the canoes into a narrow channel which splits the island and had barely enough water to float the canoes . After the island , there is a small pool , then the second part of the rapid . It is a chute which can be portaged 400 m on the left . It looked like a good climb , so we chose to line the chute . Even with the low water , the current was quite strong , and the gunwale of one canoe got pulled over . Luckily , most of the gear stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have to chase it too far . Some of the group headed over to the portage for the remainder of the chute , and others finished lining . In high water , lining would not be an option - the portage would have to be taken . The area around the rapid is quite scenic - one of the nicest spots on the route . <p> About five uneventful kilometres later we were ready to stop for lunch . After two days of paddling in scorching heat , everything was beginning to melt in the cooler , so we decided to stop at Pine Cove Lodge in Wolsley Bay to buy some blocks of ice , some fresh water for our jugs , and to cheat and have our " shore lunch " in the restaurant . Looking at the map , we guessed that even though it was unmarked , there was probably a portage cutting across the narrow strip of land separating us from Pine Cove . Our guess was correct - it was a little overgrown , so we carried across ( about 200 m ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half later , with a good meal and a cold beer under our belts , we headed east again . <p> We paddled south through Wolsley Bay towards Commanda Island , chased by a group of seven or eight canoes . Guessing that they were a school group , and that we would be competing for sites , we paddled hard to stay ahead of them . <p> At the easterly tip of Eighteen Mile Island at Commanda Island , we reached Little Pine Rapids . Apparently this is usually a centre run , but when we arrived , there was just a trickle of water flowing down a section of flat rock . We simply picked up each canoe and walked them down the right side on the slippery rock . In higher water , there is also a 25 m portage which follows the right side from a small bay adjacent to the rapid . It was nice to be heading downstream finally . <p> About 1 km further , we arrived at Big Pine Rapids . These were certainly more challenging that the previous set . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right side . Two of the canoes were portaged , and two of the canoes were run . There was a bit of ferrying and prying to stay in the small " deep water " channel and avoid the many rocks visible in the low water , but both canoes made it through fine . No idea what the rapid would look like in higher water . <p> The French River is much more " remote " beginning at this section . This part is in French River Provincial Park , and there are no further cottages until near the end of the route . Another 1.5 km past Big Pine Rapids , we were watching for Double Rapids . Good thing we were watching - we might have missed it . It was just a small riffle going down around an island . We headed south towards Double Rapids Island . This island has , as the name implies , two rapids - one on each side . On the north side of the island is " The Ladder " . It is a series of ledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right side . At the time we paddled the route , the ladder was basically dry . On the other side of the island is Blue Chute - there is a portage which begins in a small channel that almost splits the island . The trail climbs up steeply out of the channel , passes through the campsite on the island then drops down to the foot of the rapid . At the water levels we experienced , Blue Chute was obviously runnable with a straight centre run . A bit of bouncing in the standing waves at the bottom and we were done . We camped on the Double Rapids Islands that night . It was even possible to walk part way up the shoreline and take a bumpy swim down Blue Chute . <p> Day 3 - Saturday September 7 There were a number of small chutes and rapids marked on the map in the two or three kilometres following Blue Chute , but because of the low water , they were pretty much non-existent . They were all easy centre runs , or small riffles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burial site for some Jesuit missionaries drowned in the rapids upstream . <p> A stiff breeze had come up from the east , so we took the opportunity to tie the canoes together and joist a tarp for a sail . We clipped along for 6 or 7 km , stopping for the day at a nice site on the south shore of the river ( UTM Ref. 457980 ) . There was a nice point of flat rock overlooking the river , and flat , grassy tent spots . We were off the water quite early in the day . <p> Lost one member of our group that afternoon . An aluminum fishing boat pulled in looking for him , because his father-in-law was i 'll and they had to get him back to town . Now I know why we leave an accurate route description and itinerary behind . <p> Day 4 - Sunday September 8 A leisurely paddle out to the west on Sunday - 16 km back to Loons Landing on Dry Pine Bay . We were slowed down a little because one person was unexpectedly paddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got busier and we saw more and more cottages as we approached Dry Pine Bay . <p> The landscape changes dramatically in sections along this part of the river . There are some wonderful narrow channels with stunted trees and bare rock here . <p> Before noon , we were out at the lodge and unloaded . <p> The verdict on the trip ... The section heading west is much more isolated and scenic that the one heading east . We enjoyed the second half of the trip much more because of the " isolation . " The nature of the whitewater can change dramatically with differing water levels In spite of the popularity of the route , campsites were surprisingly clean - although many of them are beginning to look overused , with erosion , trampling of vegetation and packing down of underbrush -Traffic on the route was steady but not busy in September .

I found the boaters very friendly and most slowed down for us . Highly recomended . <p> I grew up on the French River , and I sure miss the annual canoe loop around 18 mile island ! I have done the trip in spring , summer and fall and I still beleive early fall is the best time to go . It 's quiet and the scenery seems more tranquill . Great place to spend a whole week and just relax and reflect on life . I agree with the author - the south leg of the river is much more scenic and private . Try the pickerel river for another great trip . <p> When we did this trip there were a few motor boats on the north section . When we turned the corner on the eastern end of the island and started down the southern section we have a very good trip . It was somewhat special to stand on land trod upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just completed this route Oct ' 09 . Weather was cold and cloud/rain but not a bad trip . Low water level made the river slightly different from our maps but we could line or shoot the rapids and swirlies without much problem . Three canoes , three adults , and six kids made for quite a run in three days , starting from Dry Pine Bay . We made it from Cedar Rapids 9am to French River outfitters ( app.34km ) 5pm on the last day due to more bad weather and no want to sleep in wet gear as we could dry nothing out . Overall not a bad trip for beginners but too much civilization and garbage for our liking . Would have liked to see some history other than a white cross to mark the route but I guess too well used . Also was difficult to find a level site for three tents . Better off to put in at Wolsley bay with one truck and go two days to hwy69 and have a second truck waiting . Would certianly not pay to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop at the Labour Day weekend 2009 with some strong but otherwise complete beginners . Found the low water conditions very suitable for a white water introduction , and the prtages easy as well . Regardless of skill levels everyone was appropriately challenged and enjoyed themselves very much .

Starting at the Whalemen River confluence is about half-way down the river , just before the canyons . <p> Exit Horton Lake via small creek to the north and join the Horton River in about 10 km . The vast majority of the river is Class I. There are no sizable rapids until approximately the 280 km mark , where the " canyon " section begins . There is an approximately 50 km long section of the river that has rapids . In this section there are three canyons .

All Rights Reserved <p> OverviewThe Horton is the most scenic of the barrenlands rivers we have paddled . The main attractions are the canyons ( with beautifully coloured rocks , tall narrow columns and many raptors and their nests ) , the Smoking Hills , nice wooded valleys much of the way with tundra never far away , the badlands near the coast , and the ocean itself ( OK , Franklin Bay of Amundsen Gulf ) . <p> As well as scenery , you get isolation ( we found it less travelled than the Thelon , Coppermine and Mara/Burnside ) , good hiking ( including a spectacular view over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip entirely above the Arctic Circle , and relatively easy ( though not cheap ) logistics . The wildlife viewing is reported to be excellent ; we saw many birds and two wolves ( rare for us ) but few caribou and muskoxen . The fishing is also reported to be excellent , but we did little . <p> We found the white water mild ; we had one portage , of 4 km . Minuses : the Horton is of relatively little historical interest and it has few eskers ( though it passes between fragments of one on the upper 2/3 or so ) . Overall , the Horton is an excellent river for experienced , well prepared paddlers ; it is ideal for a first barrenlands trip . <p> DatesOur float plane from Norman Wells landed at the north end of Horton Lake late on 1 July 2000 . We camped just east of the outlet and started downstream the next day . The south end of the lake had a lot of ice , so likely we got an early start . We were picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Water levelComments in other reports suggest that the water was high for our trip ; Herwig said that it was 1 meter above normal . <p> Travel upIt 's not possible to get from YYZ to Norman Wells in one day . Two of us overnighted in Yellowknife , two at the Edmonton airport , and two at the Leduc Inn ( 800 661 6467 , free shuttle to and from Edmonton airport ) ; the Leduc group had a good chat with the Mars people , also staying there , on their way to Devon Island . <p> Four of us arrived in N Wells on 30 June , a day early ( maybe a good idea since neither of Bob 's packs arrived until the next day ) . We were very happy with North-Wright Air ( **28;767;TOOLONG ) on our Mountain River trip in 1997 and we used them again . Carolyn picked us up at the N Wells airport , drove us to town for shopping , put the early 4 up at the chalet at the N-W Air float-plane base , ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same day , one also to the Horton ( starting though well below Horton Lake ) , and the other to the Brock for the 2nd descent ( taking maybe 12 big bags of charcoal ! ) . <p> N-W Air took the Brock group out but had to drop them off at Horton Lake due to bad weather near the coast ; their Twin Otter returned to N Wells and flew us in ; the pilots overnighted on the lake ( literally on ) and picked up the Brockers the next morning ( that was the plan anyway ) . <p> BoatsCarolyn also arranged the rental of 2 canoes from Peter Clarkson ( Western Arctic Adventures and Equipment , Inuvik , canoenwt@permafrost.com ) . We left the boats at Arctic Wings in Inuvik for WAAE and later return to Norman Wells for another Horton trip . <p> Jan and Mary brought their Pak-Boat ; I was impressed ; it worked well on the river , made the portage easier and saved us much money on the flight from the mouth to Inuvik .

We scheduled the trip to arrive in Inuvik for the Great Northern Arts Festival , well worth seeing . Enid went on later to Tuktoyaktuk . <p> Summary of northern logisticsWe were pleased with the Leduc Inn , North-Wright Air , Arctic Wings , Arctic Chalet , the WAAE boats and the Pak-Boat , and recommend them all . Thanks to Bob for handling things . <p> Gear , cooking , wate : We carried pepper spray and bangers for the bears , and a Class B EPIRB . Bill Layman 's Kanawa article ( fall 2002 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might be of interest . Neither spray skirts nor wet/dry suits are necessary ( though we had some and used them ) ; helmets are not needed . <p> Maps : We used copies of 50k:1 topos ( numbers given below ) ; many people get by with 250k:1 topos , somehow . <p> Firewood is plentiful ; there are no trees near the end but we found driftwood high on the banks . We took naphtha stoves and were glad we had them . <p> Water was clear until near the West River ( about 150 km from the coast ) but then it got ever siltier ; we paddled close to shore to spot up water exiting from ponds , storing it in expandable plastic jugs and now-empty olive barrels . Some of us filtered drinking water . The Kraiker party found the water more silty and sulphury than we did . <p> This was the 6th north-of-60 trip for my Moss Starlet tent . It has served me well under tough conditions except in one respect : in a stiff wind , its design allows sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then fall on the contents ; to stop this , I had to pile sand on the fly and put garbage bags on top of the tent , under the fly . <p> Jan 's comments on shelters : Polytarps have the virtue of cheapness and are relatively lightweight , and they are good for covering hay , RVs or lawnmowers , but are too bulky and weak to stand up to an arctic wind . Various Nylon tarps ( MEC guide , Moss/MSC parafoils , " lean-to " designs for home construction , etc. ) are well-suited . Use of paddles instead of poles saves weight and bulk . On another trip with an outfitter , the wind destroyed a lightweight aluminum tarp pole within an hour of setup . Heavier sectional tent poles are a pain in the butt to manage on a trip . <p> WasteThis is a sensitive area . We covered poo , burned tp , used only biodegradable soap and then sparingly , and used gravel and sand ( no detergent ) to clean pots ; when we had to use soap we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranged from hot early in the trip ( we dunked hats in the river every half-hour or so ) to cold near the coast ( we got rather chilled at one point ) . It rained two days . Wind forced two layovers , for a total of 2+1/2 days , and we had to pull in early several times . <p> Culture checkWe saw one tent early in the trip ( no boat or people ) , a collapsed trapper 's cabin on the L just upstream from the West River , some canoes stored on shore near the mouth , and only one person ( Herwig Schubert , Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Salzburg , who has paddled the Horton several times ) ; I remember a cabin in good shape on the R near the end but others do n't . <p> Wildlife2 wolves ( not dingy white , but many shades from pitch black to pure white ) , 1 arctic fox , a few isolated caribou , muskoxen only in one herd about 1 km away , likely a young bear dashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagles , many peregrines , many Arctic ground squirrels , half a dozen tundra ( aka whistling ) swans , and not a few bugs ( not as many as on the Thelon ) ; apart from the wolves , the eagle and peregrine nests and occupants left the most abiding memories . <p> FishingBob caught an 8 lb char on his 1st cast at one creek mouth , and assorted grayling and pike at another . <p> ArtBill did lots of watercolours , about 1 per day . <p> SuggestionsThe Horton is isolated and the weather can be fierce . It is important to have high-quality clothing , sleeping bags , rain gear and tents ; there are enough ways to mess up without having tents rip , poles break , pack straps break , etc . Be prepared for everything from sweltering in the blazing sun to shivering in a cold driving rain and worse , with rapid changes from one <p> extreme to the other . <p> Naphtha stoves come in very useful in bad conditions . You 'll be sorry if you do n't take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as an external ground sheet may save pain in the rain . The river is remote . Intermediate ww skills are <p> desirable ; caution is vital . Your conditions may differ widely from ours ; rapids easy or difficult for us may be the opposite for you . Scout and enjoy the scenery . <p> The river is braided and the best channel is often not obvious . Expect to drag ; long painters for tracking will likely be <p> useful . Except in rapids , go early to the outside of the curve ; watch for side channels carrying lots of water . Some sand cliffs near the coast are undercut , exposing the permafrost to the air ( drip , drip , drip ) ; best keep clear . <p> The wind can come up fast and hard . Boats should be secured by tying them to trees or putting rocks in them ; unsecured tents have been known to blow away . Expect to be windbound several days ; schedule a few more for hiking . We had an easy trip , but comments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger current than usual ; 25 days on the river seems reasonable . <p> Leave a day or so at the beginning and the same at the end in case your packs do n't arrive with you , the weather is too rotten for flying , ... <p> Take an old toothbrush and clean tent zippers every time you camp on sand . You should find active smoking spots close to the water , so there 's no need to go for a hike to inspect them ; some of the dead spots are also attractive , a gorgeous red . <p> Plan to have some means ( empty barrels , plastic jugs , etc ) for storing water below the West River . Take fungicide ( for feet ) , paddling gloves and hand cream , waterproof camera or case , some kind of shelter , a bug tent , and gloves for around camp ( hands can swell badly from bites and sun ) . <p> Packing : We thought that there would be no portages , at worst a few short ones , so some of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was 4 km long .

Desperation site , strong candidate for our lifetime worst . The day started OK ; after a few km we spotted Herwig at his camp and went over to chat before setting out again . Then came the rain and a cold , strong head wind , bad enough in itself , that generated splashy waves on hitting the current ; half the group was soon verging on hypothermia . After several fruitless stops , we found a cramped , muddy spot , got the tents up and crawled into the bags where we stayed for most of the next day and a half ; Jan and Mary were so cold and wet that , to my memory , they did n't leave their tent for 24 hours or so . The wind stayed cold and stiff but the rain changed to light and intermittent .

Of course the native people handle far worse conditions without our fancy gear , as had Hearne , Franklin and the rest . <p> N22 97C11 788 332 Good site on top of gravel ; good hike upstream ; much smoke in hills on all sides . <p> N23 97C14 807 487 Necessity site ; bad ( blowing sand ) , but we had to camp before reaching the start point for the hike . <p> We started the hike at 835 474 on map 97C14 ; we followed gullies , going left to reach the hills above the coast . The effort was rewarded ( people shouting in excitement , scarcely " silent upon a peak " ) by a beautiful view over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance and the Horton delta ) . The area is marked as part of the Smoking Hills , but the smoke sites are all upstream ( so you 'll have to look earlier if you want to see and smell ' em close up ) . <p> N25 97C14 795 583 We camped on sand beside a gravel bar used recently as a runway and scouted pickup points for the next day ( not easy because the water is so silty ) . Jan saw the arctic fox here and got close-ups ; a caribou wandered through . In the morning , we hiked down almost to the old channel . The pack ice had drifted in close to the delta , so I hoped the polar bears were well to the north . The first flight got out OK but the second ( with Jan and Bob ) was delayed to the next day ; after a comfy night in the plane , they had to make a running start with Bob on the pontoon cutting a line to a pile of rocks , getting nigh blown away by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remote river ; it demands respect . For us , in what seems to have been high water , the rapids were either ledges or fair-sized standing waves ; we found no rock gardens or boulder fields . Your conditions may differ enough from ours to make the following worse than useless . <p> Canyon starting near 367 196 on map 97B9 : there are 3 rapids close together . The 1st was a ledge ; we sneaked L. The 2nd was just waves ; we sneaked L and then dragged , tracked and/or bashed through gravel .

We suggest landing on the L shore as soon as possible and scouting from there ; portaging R should be a conscious decision . In detail : The river splits around some rocks , with the main current going L over a good-sized ledge ; the R channel can be tracked . Below the rocks , the canyon wall closes in on the R ; just below is a ledge running from the R wall to maybe a small gap at the extreme L. We pulled over on the R side , above the rocks . Bob and Jan scouted several km along the top of the cliff but found no break in the canyon wall . On their return we discussed ferrying over below the rocks , to the L side above the ledge ; we were n't sure though that we could make the ferry because of the fair-sized standing waves below the rocks . <p> We discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there were more rapids below the ledge and we were n't sure that we get around them easily.This took a long time ; Bill got impatient and took off ; the rest followed . After a steep carry to the top , we bushwhacked out to an open rocky area and a big brown rock ; this part of the portage is marked with cairns but it is easy to lose one 's way ( and packs ) . Once in the open , we headed toward the bluffs on the L side , entered a wooded area and found a way down , just above a creek on the other side . Got only 1 carry in that day . Camped at the start of the portage and did 2 carries the 2nd day . Ferried over to the L side and camped . <p> There were several more rapids , none anything special ; sneaks and tracks handled them all .

The 4th was a significant drop . The 2nd canyon rapids are significant . We scouted the entire canyon on the left up on top of the canyon walls which provided a good view but took a long time . We were able to avoid a long portage by a combination of paddling a difficult ferry here and there , some hard lining and two short portages - total about 100 yard combined - completed down in the canyon . It was a long hard day for our over 50 group . Alan 's description was a great help to us but you do need to proceed through the canyon area with great caution avoiding the temptation to scout from the boat . <p> Submitted by : Rob Gerety on 2008-01-23 <p> Just a note - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful trip report is mis-identified .

The most important part of any trip is the time we spend planning before we leave . If we choose to skimp on the planning process we 're almost certain guaranteed that our group will receive a healthy dose of adversity and discomfort , and we will possibly be putting our lives and the lives of others in danger . <p> Stories of groups who arrived at the put-in point at the beginning of their trip only to discover missing food , tents , paddles ( yes , even canoes ! ) are not uncommon . Even sadder are the tales of the groups who put in a hard day of paddling before realizing their omissions . <p> These stories may sound amusing , but they involve experiences which are at best inconvenient and at worst dangerous . Having to drive back two or three hours from your put-in is a major pain . It means that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us when we get back five or six ours later . We are going to be running half a day behind schedule . We probably wo n't get to our planned campsite that night , or if we do it will be by paddling long and hard in the afternoon . Setting up tents in the dark is not the best way to spend the first evening of our canoe trip . <p> Worse than that scenario is that there is sometimes a temptation to look at the long backtrack for forgotten gear , and say " forget it . " The temptation to get the canoes into the water and get going may mean that we abandon good sense and decide to leave without the third tent and say " we 'll squeeze in together " , or to ignore the fact that that last food pack is missing by saying " we 'll stretch the menu by catching fish .

The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoing of many an experienced tripper . Experience can make us lazy . We know that all of the gear is in a pile in the basement from our last trip , so we do n't have to check it against a list . We just throw it in the truck and get going . We think that we do n't need a detailed menu or grocery list - we have a " pretty good idea " of what to bring . <p> Careful planning and written check lists are important whether you are leaving on your first trip or your fiftieth . If you are not the organized type , or you are n't confident about your ability to plan the trip down to the very last detail , ask for help or delegate .

Me and gear = 260 pounds . Handles well loaded . Quite responsive . Not at all sluggish . I do spend a little more time that I would like bailing out water after playing in rapids . But best of all I do n't dread the flat water between rapids . I can keep up with the tandems on the flats without exhausting myself . And I 've never met a river that did n't have a lot of flat water . <p> The Raven is a well made - solid boat . It has good handling , decent manouvering and tracking even with a load . The biggest drawback is that it is a wet ride . Since purchasing I have added a Nothwater Spray cover which helps alot in the bigger stuff .

But this may not be possible in low water . I portaged my pack the 1600 m and to the other end of the 135 m portage after the bridge and paddled/portaged the the canoe in short hops . 134054 @qwx994054 <p> by Tom Angelakis <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freres . I was told at the park gate that Ruis des Sept Freres was too shallow to navigate and the best way to explore the small wilderness lakes was by paddling north on Lac des Sept Freres to the 200m portage to Lac Diamond . But I decided to at least investigate if it was possible so that I could make it a true loop trip ( without travelling over the same sections on the way out ) . Any excuse for some river scenery . <p> Sections of the river are impasable because of log jams , sweepers , and shallow rocky rapids . But there are calm sections in between . The canoe route map provided free of charge ( plain paper double sided 11x17 photocopy - you can purchase better quality maps but the free ones are fine ) at the park gate indicates 3 portages on the river section between lac Sept Freres and Lac Montjoie , a 1600m , 200m and another 200m portage . I portaged the pack for the 1600m section which was not too bad because most of it is along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way . I had lunch at the end of the portage just after the bridge ( the portage goes back into the bush on the right just before the bridge - if you cross the bridge you missed the trail ) . I decided to paddle the canoe in the sections I could and portage around obstructions . The shoreline is n't conducive to lining because of all the shoreline debris and strainers . The sections I paddled were Class 1-2 rapids and calm sections . If you are not as interested in river scenery as I am then the 1600m portage on an even dirt road is pretty easy despite its length . This was late May - early June so even less of the river would be passable later in the season . <p> I portaged the canoe on the road about 60m around the first log jam and rapid . Put in for a short calm paddle then a 150m portage on a good trail around more rapids and strainers . I put in again until just before the river drops and bends in narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200m but through bush so it was harder going . There is probably a trail somewhere but I did n't bother to look too hard . After this section I put in again until the portage around the bridge ( 200m on the map but signed as 135m on the trail ) . Paddle down another calm section until a 380m portage around rapids and strainers and then the river opens up to Lac Montjoie . There are discrepencies of portage length between the park maps and what is signed on the ground . On the map , the last portage is 200m but signed as 380m on the ground . The middle portage of 200m ( on the map ) is signed as 135m on the ground . The 1600m portage is probably about right but I broke it up into 50m , 150m , and 200m portages and paddling the short navigable sections inbetween . You can portage short river sections on a bush trail or up on the road for longer sections until the bridge turnoff . It took me almost 3 hours from putting in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monjoie - 3 kms as the crow flies . But I was in no hurry and enjoying the scenery . I paddled north on Lac Montjoie to the 80m portage into Lac Marceau . <p> The first campsite on Lac Marceau is on a low point but close to the little waterfall emptying Lac Marceau into LacMontjoie and therefore many blackflies . I headed for the second campsite on the north shore . It is sheltered from the wind behind cedars but still the blackflies were n't as bad as the site closer to the moving water . But the mosquitoes came out just before sundown . I was obviously the first person on this site this year and it seemed wild until I noticed the road running right behind it ( no traffic though ) . Two good tentpads and one swamped . <p> The campsites on the small interior lakes are typically tucked behind cedar shoreline and may lack great views of the lake but they do have a wild feel to them . There is no " camp furniture " as you often find in more frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on around a campfire . The map denotes how many tentpads and these are usually small in size . Large family tents might not fit the tentpads in some of these campsites . Water levels appear to be up on all these interior lakes so there are a lot of living and dead trees leaning into the water on the shoreline meaning the swimming access is not great . All the campsites I saw had round plastic barrel-like latrines ( all of which needed new holes dug ) . The campsites on Lac des Sept Freres were generally more open with better views and the occassional camp furniture and grills left behind . These obviously get more use than the small interior lakes . <p> Day 2 <p> Slept until after 10 am . Fitful sleep often woke up but otherwise nice long rest after a hard day 's work . Rain all day . <p> 1350m portage to Lac Primeau. 2/3 dirt road and 1/3 bush trail . The trail part had 13 deadfalls across the trail . While trying to go around one on my first carry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a long portage with the pack but not as bad with the canoe after I cleared the branches from around the deadfalls to make them passabel with a canoe . I used a solid pice of branch as a club to break smaller branches in one swing . At least now the path is clear up to the trunk of the deadfall so you can sttep over them or pass the canoe over . Before the branches completely obscured the path . Clearing was hard work but worth it to make getting through with the canoe easier and safer . By the end of the day I was quite sore . <p> Lac Primeau is a jewl of a lake . Not even a campsite so completely wild except for the portages and 2 portage signs . I wish I had more time to explore its bays and swamps and island . <p> The portage to Lac Clement was signed as 320m but says 210 on the map . I counted out 145 paces . Four more deadfalls across the path but not much branch clearing required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high ( beavers ? ) Because there is a flooded out log cabin on some flooded land with standing dead trees only . The cabin is at least 2-3 feet deep in the water . Doors and windows still intact and a flooded outhouse deeper in the bush . I wonder how long it tkaes for the collection of human waste to work its way throught he lake(s) ? There 's a small wild campsite on Lac Clement . <p> 320m portage to Lac Ogilvy had a very steep sectiondropping down to Lac Ogilvy with more deadfalls making passing with the pack difficult . More branch clearing required before I could get the canoe through . Definitely confirms the " always take the pack first " theory . Dead tired after the Lac Ogilvy portage . The Lac Ogilvy campsites did not look too impressive . <p> Short 60m portage to Lac Mercier . Lacs Mercier , Labelle , and Lartigue are connected by clear narrow channels with no water level change . Another indication of rising water levels since these lakes were named . The campsite on Lac Lartique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good clear tent pads on different levels . <p> Hard day and much more sore and exhausted than yesterday . Set up camp after 6 pm . Set up VCS 12 bug tarp for the first time . Helped to dry things out . Noticed some modifications to tarp and bug netting to make more useable space and higher head clearance . It needs extra fastex buckles and strap attachments between tarp and bug net between corners and maybe 1 each on top between two high corners and centre hanger . It is comfortable for two people with gear and to cook under . 3-4 would fit but cramped . <p> In sleeping bag by mindnight . <p> Day 3 <p> Instead of taking the 420m portage from Lac Lartigue to Lac Diamond I decided to paddle up the connecting stream . There were four liftovers over beaver dams . Again , this route may not be advisable later in the season with lower water levels . Lac Diamond has a nice campsite on a point with 3 tentpads . <p> After the final 200m portage into Lac des Sept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campsite . It is a big campsite , with at least 5 tentpads , enough for a CCR gathering . Just to the north there is a small island with what looks like excellent diving rocks . It has a campsite closed for regeneration . There is another good campsite with 4 tentpads on the nearby shore . <p> As I started paddling south I saw the first people since I set off from Lac des Sept Freres three days before . I saw three fishermen in a small outboard . A little further south and I saw a 4 canoe family group heading in the opposite direction . Then I saw the same floatplane take off and land 3-4 times ( there are a couple of fishing/hunting lodges on this lake ) . I imagine this lake gets quite busy in July-August . There is another big campsite with 7 tentpads on the west shore with a nice view overlooking the lake . But it looks like it gets heavy use causing soil erosion and this site might have to be closed soon .

With a few simple tools and some other equipment , most damaged can be repaired ' in the field . ' <p> It 's important to remember that the repair does n't have to be permanent in nature , nor does it have to be pretty . The only consideration is getting the boat back in serviceable condition .

Colin , Doug #1 , Travis and myself Doug #2 . Our two canoes were a Mad River Revelation ( Royalex ) and a tortured Swift Dumoine ( Royalite ) . <p> The Harricana runs for a total length of 415 km through northwestern Quebec into Hanna Bay . We completed the final section from the last road crossing north of Joutel , to Hanna Bay , a total distance of about 170 km . The last road crossing is a Tembek logging road that goes to the mining operation of Selbaie . Other starting points for the Harricana include Joutel ( 225 km river ) and Amos ( 370 km river ) <p> Our start point of the trip was north of Joutel , and the finishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ km east of Cochrane . To avoid a costly vehicle shuttle we used two vehicles . We packed one vehicle full of gear and drove both cars to Cochrane . In Cochrane , we left one vehicle at the train station and continued with everyone and everything in the second car to the river in Joutel . From the last road crossing to Hanna Bay , is approx 170 km by river . Hanna Bay is approx. 70 km east of Moosonee . Crossing James Bay to Moosonee by canoe is dangerous and difficult . Tidal flats go out until the shoreline is barely visible . There are few options for camping along the way . I know one group who made the crossing . From their experiences , and our timeline we decided to charter a ride back to Moosonee . We arranged a charter boat pick up with the Cree Nation . Bushland Air ( ex Moosonee ) will fly you , but not your canoes . Canoes require boat pick up regardless . The shuttle is expensive . ( I believe there is another company out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Amos direct ) . If you do paddle the bay , add at least two days to your itinerary . Once back in Moosonee we would take the Little Bear Express back to Cochrane . Upon finishing the trip we would take the car in Cochrane back to Joutel , get the second car , and continue home from there . Side note : 2 canoes , gear and 4 grown men makes for a tight ride in a small sedan . Another note : be sure to have a set of jumper cables with you when you arrive at the initial start point , we made good use of ours ! Not to mention our car had become home to a family of mice . <p> We planned to spend 8 days on the river . We would cross the bay by prearranged charter boat pick up on the 9th day , returning to Cochrane via the Little Bear Express on the 10th day . <p> Notes about the river : <p> Finding information on this trip was difficult . I bought topographic maps and a $15 trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless . I found 3 other trip reports on the web . I also had one first hand account of the river from a family friend who ran the river twice and was stranded on it back in the early 80s . <p> This section of river is covered by eight 1:50,000 topographic maps . The maps are not 100% accurate . Some marked rapids are docile swifts . Some marked rapids are actually chutes and falls . Some marked chutes and falls are actually runnable rapids . Some of the white water is n't marked at all . Be prepared . Scout whenever possible , and be prepared to back ferry and eddy out when required . <p> There are no marked or established portages . Yet , many rapids on this river must be bypassed . Portaging is difficult . Be ready to carry on the boulder shore , along side the edge of a canyon , and possibly through the brush . Lining is often an option . Bring enough rope for lining . We had at least 25 on the bow and stern . In some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult . The length of sets and topography of the shore makes it difficult to walk before paddling . In places , the river is wide to the point where it is impossible to pick the best line from shore . We often scouted from the water . Paddling the shore cautiously , we would eddy out and scout when necessary . <p> The water quality is poor . Its brown and murky . Visibility is less than a foot in good light . This makes reading the water more difficult . It is impossible to judge depth and locate submerged rocks . Swimming is also less enjoyable when you cant see anything . I read that the murky water is a result of paper mills in the Amos area . I do n't  know if this is true . I do know the water looks and tastes like shit . <p> The Harricana is wide and deep . We traveled in late August and had no problem with water levels .

It was 8:30 PM Saturday when we came to the river crossing on the logging roads north of Joutel . We were immediately surprised by the size and power of this river . Already near 500 M wide in Joutel , the river flowed strong . Finally , a late August river trip with plenty of water ! <p> The river at this point was wide , slow , and deep . Several camps lined the shore for the first several kilometers , however we saw nobody . Towards the end of the day we encountered our first whitewater obstacle . A CIII ledge blocked our path . There were two possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river took a sharp bend after the drop . We inspected with great length and ran it loaded on the right opening without incident . From here swifts continued as we entered a small canyon . At this time of the day , the rain had stopped but the winds had increased . Even in the swifts we could not make forward progress without strong paddling . The river narrowed . Ahead of us was a CII through the canyon . We ran it loaded through the center and had a considerable amount of bailing afterwards . We made camp here on a rocky point . Great campsite . The rapid would have made a great play spot in better weather . The Northern lights made an appearance . <p> The river today was numerous CI/CII , some technical . Everything was run loaded . We passed the confluence of the Turgeon . While the Turgeon was less murky , it was still dark and tea colored , doing nothing to improve the water quality of the Harricana . By the end of the day we had reached One Mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our trip reports had been of the right side . We decided to go left . There was a small fall at the beginning ; we ran our canoes loaded through a small chute on the right side . From here the river continued as a CI technical . Half way through the island the river bends . Around the bend is a second waterfall , which is marked on the map . We were able to back ferry and land safely at a rock outcrop in the center of the river , where we could portage the canoes and gear as far as possible . We ran the bottom of the falls . Colin and I got hung up bad here . We camped at the bottom of 2nd falls near the end of One Mile Island . It was a pocket of sand big enough for two tents . The bugs were mildly annoying until the temperature dropped &amp; northern lights graces us with their presence . <p> Day 3 : Tuesday August 20th . Weather : Perfect Total distance : 30 km . <p> Early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dumoine . We fixed it with rope from the float bag lashings and were on our way again . The river began to take on a new persona . It was another great day of continuous CI /CII/CIII and one CIV . However today most ended in steep drops , with heavy sets at the bottom . We bailed after most sets . We camped on a smooth bedrock shore about 7 km from the entrance to Seven Mile Island . Here we found a weathered aluminum paddle . Again the bugs surprised us for late August . Northern lights gave us our best show of the trip very nice view . <p> Our day began with a short CIV run . Only Colin and I decided to run after portaging our gear . The other canoe lined . Soon after we started down a long CII run . Our two boats began the run far apart , both playing near the shoreline . Further down the rapid the river narrowed . As we approached the last drop , I missed our opportunity to eddy out . By this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe , now following my line , also failed to eddy out . Haystacks were 2 M high in the center channel . Our canoe , in front , flipped in the whitewater . I fell out and swam helplessly in the aerated water . Colin managed to stay in by executing a flawless canoe roll , entirely by luck . At the same time , Travis boat came over a wave and directly down onto a submerged rock . The bow was completely smashed . The canoe instantly filled with water and was unmanuverable . Once we washed out into the pool below the rapid we were able to swim safely to the shore , still 100 M away . Not much further downstream was a large cascading waterfall <p> We lost two good paddles ( including my $100 Hammerhead ! ) , and thankfully nothing else . <p> Damage to the Dumoine was extensive .

The entire afternoon was spent rebuilding the bow with Marine fiberglass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish the trip . <p> With our pride injured and the Dumoine " repaired " we paddled within 1 km of Seven Mile Island .

Rock islands the size of football fields cover the river . It is very scenic . We camped beside a gorge . <p> We lost about 5 hours of paddling today . It would not affect our ability to finish the trip on time . However , our injured canoe caused us to be more conservative in choosing which rapids to run/line/portage for the rest of the trip . <p> Day 5 : Thursday August 22nd . Weather : Fabulous Distance : 7 km <p> Pinpointing your location at the entrance to Seven Mile Island is difficult . So is finding the best pass through it . Like the majority of people , we chose the right channel . There are several entrances to the right channel . We took one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiberglass canoe . Today we had four portages . They were all difficult and dangerous , as we carried canoes overhead atop the edge of gorges . Besides the portages , we lined 3 times and had several combinations of run/line/portage . The scenery is fabulous . The falls and chutes easily compare to Thunderhouse on the Missinaibie . We found a campsite on an island midway across . This was a hard day . I think we moved more on foot then in the canoe . We only had three heavy sets to deal with from here before meeting up with the left channel of Seven Mile Island . <p> Day 6 : Friday August 23rd . Weather : Terrific Distance : 23 km <p> By lunch we had finished Seven Mile Island and the last three sets with one portage , one lining , and one run . Where the right and left channels meet there is a spectacular limestone cliff . Below the island we ran the remaining CI and swifts before things leveled out . Be careful of these ledges , some proved difficult . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red Old Town beneath a mudslide . There is some current at this point but not as much as we would have liked . We camped on a limestone shelf , very sun burnt . From here , the river was 1 km in width for the rest of the way . <p> A few hours of paddling brought us to Limestone Rapids . For the first time we encountered low water conditions . We hunted channels through the rocks and islands . Limestone consists of continuous swifts and CIs with ledges for several km . The wind increased all day . By mid afternoon we were so cold we pulled onto shore and huddled under a tarp with a burning stove for two hours . Swifts continue from below Limestone rapids to Low shoal island . By the time we approached low shoal , wind was so intense that forward progress was impossible . We decided at that time to take the left channel around Low Shoal , only because it offered more protection from the wind . We camped on a sandy beach on low shoal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site . It always makes you glad you 've been keeping the food away from the tents at night . Numerous mudslides scare the shorelines along at the beginning of the left cannel . <p> We started extra late today . The winds were still strong but had shifted in our favor . We encountered two black bears across the river from our campsite . It was the only large wildlife of the entire trip . There was one CI at the start of Low Shoal , and several swifts throughout the island , however the real white water was behind us . Low shoal Island disappeared behind us and we started the final leg of the trip through the tide-influenced river . Low tide was very apparent as we passed the island . We found the deepest water on river right and set up sail . Even with the strong tail winds the incoming tide made progress slow . We sailed from low shoal right to the Goose camp , about 4 km from James Bay . We arrived at the Hanna Bay Goose camp at 2PM . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had experienced before . The locals later told us these were bay mosquitoes that blew down from the north . The mosquitoes were large in size and numbers and abnormally vicious . Thankfully the lodge was open and we took shelter from the bugs . <p> Day 9 : Monday August 26th . Weather : Stormy Distance : 0 The thermometer read 10 degrees today . Winds were so strong it formed whitecaps on the river . Obviously , no freighter canoes would be crossing Hanna Bay today to pick us up . We played cards all day in the partially completed lodge . We explored some abandoned trails and camps . Not much to do here . To add to the experience , we ran out of food and cigarettes . By staying here an extra day here we would miss our train . The Little Bear only runs Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday and leaves at 9 AM . <p> Our charter arrived shortly before lunch . However , we had to wait for the tide and did n't  leave camp until 4:30 PM . The boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though the weather was good , the ride was very , very rough . <p> We stayed in Moosonee Tuesday and Wednesday night . We did n't  have reservations and had difficulty finding accommodations . Tuesday we got the last rooms at the Otter Inn , and Wednesday stayed at the Polar Bear Lodge . <p> Final thoughts : <p> Although we spent 8 days on the water , this trip can easily be done in 7 days . Even though the shuttle was expensive , we were all glad we did n't  have to paddle the bay . Well save that for another time . <p> Overall the trip was amazing ! Even though we severely crippled one of our Canoes and were stranded at an abandoned hunt camp for 48 hours , the trip was definitely a success . <p> The one commodity that is hard to acquire ( for us ) , that is a necessity is the time off work . If you can get the time off , do it , and you 'll be rewarding yourself with the feeling that you accomplished something not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wilderness several days away from any civilization is not something to be taken lightly so plan well and do n't  leave anything you think you might need behind . Our repair kit is a perfect example ; we did n't  bring it with us the previous trip however this year it proved invaluable . Without it we would probably have ditched half of our gear and somehow tried to make it out with 4 men in one canoe ! <p> It never hurts to be comfortable , some things we did n't  bring but sure wished we had were bug nets , bug spray , and perhaps some booze for the 2 day layover at the goose camp ( no drinking and paddling ) . <p> I can not stress enough how bad the bugs were in Hanna Bay comparable to a humid day in early June . <p> If anyone finds a Grey Owl 62 " Hammerhead Whitewater wooden Paddle on the Harricana , please let me know . I would also consider selling the topo maps at a discounted price to anyone planning this trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did a trip with a group of people in August 2003 , 26 days and 308km in total , from ghost town Joutel ( the town with streets and sidewalks , but NO houses ) . After reaching Hanna Bay Goose Camp , we crossed James Bay , which was very tricky . We had maps of the shoals , but were n't sure what time of day they would appear , so upon crossing the Bay , at about mid-afternoon , the tide lowers , and we run into a 2km-long shoal running out into James Bay from the shore , the shoal itself being about 600m wide . So at this point it was either a very difficult 600m , slippery-rock portage changing constantly from the tide , or a 4km paddle to the tip of the shoal and back to shore again . We opted for the paddle , and made it to " shore , " just as the tide was rising again . However , we then faced about 500-800m portage from the tide ground to dry land , with rising tide . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear in-shore . The whole day was spent fighting 2-3ft crests and strong winds . We stayed the night at nipissing ( I think ) point on the Bay . The next day we camped at Ship Sands Island ( aka BUG Island . I have never experienced such a large mosquito population in my life . Do n't ever camp on Ship Sands Island ) . We camped there , it was hell . From there we paddled to the Park opposite Moosonee , where we stayed the night , with almost NO mosquitoes ! A girl on our trip was pleased to tell us that her Grandfather owned the only Hotel in moosonee , so we ate a deluxe caribou-burger on the house , as well as much needed showers for everyone ! We then portaged our gear into the town , which consists of a liquor store , a welfare office , a shopping centre , and many bars . Took the little bear express to cochrane . r h y s l i n g @ r o g e r s . com <p> Submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great trip . I 'm very interested in paddling the river in the early summer of 2010 .

The river is fairly narrow and you can paddle along one shoreline or the other to minimize the effect . Fishing for pike and bass is good , with the occasional walleye or even the elusive muskie making an appearance . Beaver , deer , raccoons , waterfowl , loon , herons , and other species are seen along the river . <p> You need a topo map for Lake Joseph , 31E/4 , having a 1:50000 scale , which shows the areas discussed . <p> Access to Moon Falls at the Georgian Bay level can be from one of two locations on Arnolds Bay , or locations further down on Woods Bay ( Sunset Point Cottages , Woods Bay Marina , etc. off Healy Lake road ) . Arnolds Bay is the closest , by taking Twelve-Mile Bay road off highway 69/400 south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn North on the Moon River Cottage road . This road is a single , twisty , rough trail with poor sight lines around the turns , so take your time and be prepared to stop and back up to allow an on coming vehicle to pass . This takes you to the Moon River Cottages and Moon River Marina . I suggest the Cottages as they have a shallow beach to launch the canoe , whereas the Marina has a rocky shoreline and a dock . Also the Cottage launch has better protection from the prevailing winds . In 2001 I paid $4 a day for parking and $4 for launching my canoe . The owners have a small store selling the basics should you forget something . <p> The directions from here assume normal summer water levels , which are controlled by a dam downstream of Bala . High water from spring runoff is normal through early June and again in late October for the period when upstream lakes are lowered for the winter . Occasionally in a very wet summer high water may be encountered for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly constant once the spring runoff has passed as the control dam upstream let 's excess water out only if the reservoir gets too full . . <p> Leaving the shore paddle East across the bay toward the Moon Basin . The entrance to the basin is shallow and narrow , and depending on the water level a strong current may flow through here . There may be marker floats indicating the deeper channel . Continuing up the basin your first obstacle near the Falls is a low ledge , which you have to drag or carry over . The right side of this ledge has a gentle sloping rock surface and I simply drag my aluminum canoe up over it , a distance of some 5 meters or so , and continue on up the river . The Falls are actually two drops with a pool between them . You paddle up the left shoreline as close to the lower drop as possible and take out for the portage . The trail runs over the rocks to the where the trees start and then turns to follow the shore to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters to the put in spot . The trail is well worn with only a few spots requiring extra caution . <p> You are now on the river and can follow along the left shore toward a narrows and then to the right ( South ) branch of the river . The river divides here , the left ( North ) branch going through a deep gorge requiring a Herculean effort to portage up and over to the other side , with the right branch being the easier to navigate , although very shallow . Entering the South branch you have to carry round a short drop of about 1 meter . I usually carry on the left side , and it is about 10 meters in length . On up the river you encounter a small island with an old low beaver dam on the left side and a rock ledge on the right side . The water here is only ankle deep and you may have to line your canoe up to the dam . Depending on the water level one or the other may be easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as its easier on the canoe . <p> On up the river you come to the Twin Rapid . Take out on the left side . Getting to the top of the rapid is a steep rocky 15-meter climb . Watch your footing and take your time . On top an easy path leads to the put in spot , about 100 meters along the shore . <p> You are now on the longest stretch of rapid free water and can camp in the immediate area to explore the river at your leisure . There are 2 large camping areas here and a couple of smaller 1- tent sites . From the time I put my canoe in the water until my camp is set up here takes me about 4 hours . That 's for a 5-day trip load , which for me means 3 trips per portage if I have to unload the canoe . <p> From here you can take day paddles up the river using either the North branch ( narrow and shallow ) or the right branch to where they join up . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , over 35-meters . A creek comes in on the North from a small lake formed by a beaver dam . A short portage takes you in to the lake . Back on the river continue upstream to Curtin Chute . Depending on the water level you can walk and line the canoe to the base of the ledge and the carry around the right side of the big rock in the middle of the river ( just a note , in high water this rock is covered , with meter high haystacks coming off the backside ) . From her you can paddle up to the Seven Sisters rapids . On the return trip at the junction take the opposite branch of the river for a change in scenery . <p> Day tripping down river on the right ( North ) branch , portage the Twin rapid , again a steep rocky 15-meter climb . Start by paddling into the narrow entrance leading to the rapid and take out on the right side . Carry over the rocks to the climb down to the water ( total distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camping area at the top of this rapid ( if the water is high or you are not sure take out on the right bank just before the entrance and scout it out , or carry from here , adds about 100 meters ) . Down stream another short island divides the river . On the right an old low beaver dam creates a 1-meter drop , and on the left a rock ledge does the same . I usually take the right side , as its closer and easier to drag over . From here the river opens up into a large lake like area leading down to the gorge I mentioned above . Take the opportunity to climb to the top of the gorge and have a look around . If you have the time and energy to portage , this route could be used on the way back to the falls ! There are a couple of small lakes to the north end of this area which can be portaged into and provide good bass fishing . If you look around the area you should see evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back out to the falls stop after your portage and take a swim . This is a popular spot for area cottagers and campers to visit for picnics and cooling off on hot days . Although the basin is shallow for the most part try trolling a lure as use paddle out and you may just catch your dinner . Arnolds Bay is also worth a try to catch something on the way back . <p> Moon River Circle Trip <p> A 3 to 4 day circle trip on the Moon River and area lakes can be started from various points . My son and I did it in the late 80s , starting on the river where the old Tower Road meets the river below the Seven Sisters . This is the road you see on the map starting at the bend in #69 north of the bridge , where you note a mobile home park and dump ( the trial starts at the dump and goes to the river ) . At that time you could drive a vehicle to the river as long as you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow trail , or dents in the gas tank from rocks and deep ruts . I do n't  know if the trail is still passable . You might check with the local MNR for current information . <p> The route could also start from Arnolds Bay , or Sunset Point on Moon River Bay ( you can drive to this point from the Healy lake road ) . Portage from Sunset Point to Healy Lake ; paddle North East up Healy to the dam where Kapikog Lake enters . Both Healy and Kapikog are developed with cottages but the rest of the route is crown land with no cottages . Go south across Kapikog , portage to a little lake called Dunbar , south to an unnamed lake , portage to Eagle , continue on South to Vaughan , portage to Buckhorn , and portage along the Tower trail to the Moon River . From here its down river to Arnolds Bay or Sunset point , depending on where you started . <p> Canada Canoe Routes , edited by Nick Nickels ( 1973 ) , describes this route ( page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 days starting from the river , camping below Moon Falls the first night , on an island at the North end of Eagle the 2nd , and driving out late on the 3rd day .

I was not aware of the campsites available but it did n't matter any way because they were all taken . there is on at the first set of rapids and one at ther second . I also saw some people camping below the impassable gorge . I travelled the whole route to the basin by 2:30 after putting in by 8:30am .

I used to put in on the Musquash south of the Moon River on hyway 69 . Paddle up to the top of the moon and then down to the Jackknife rapids and camp there . I would then when we reached the 69 hyway jog down the hyway to my vehicle and drive back to the river for loading.I did the trip 25 years ago , then 20 years ago with my son and I , then 18 years ago with my wife , son of 2 and a small dog . I then paddled in 3 years ago with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed again at the same camp site . Then 2 years ago my wife and I , in one canoe , my oldest son and his girlfriend in another canoe and my other 2 sons in 2 kayaks paddled in for a nice steak dinner over the fire to the same camp site and the river was just a beautiful then as it was years before . Last week August 1st 2008 my wife and I rode our motorcycle up to check out the put in area at 69 . While I knew that the old metal bridge was gone I was very disappointed to see that there was no way to access the river from either side of the hyway . We spent almost 1 hour riding around trying to find a way down to the river bank with no luck . My jeep might make it from the side of the highway but it also might roll over , its that steep and now very rocky ? I am very disappointed that the Dept of Hyways has closed this entry point as I have some of my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to find another way to get there . I know I can put in at Bala and paddle across to the Moon , as I did once many years ago but I 'm getting older and my back is n't as strong as it used to be . I 'd hate to have to trade in my trusty fiberglass canoe for a cedar canoe that would of coarse be lighter just because they closed the entrance at 69 . I thought that that being a traditional canoe entrance that they could n't close it the way they have , but I guess the Government doesn'y make any money off us who still canoe on our Canadian rivers without paying them a cut $$$ . Everywhere I read that its $5-$10-$20-$30 , just to park your vehicle and the the same again just to slide your canoe into the water . If I wanted to go to a Provincial park and pay money , I would n't be complaining here now !

I put in on Lac Nichcotea , it was a warm , calm sunny Saturday . I paddled south on Nichcotea for 2 km , then turned due west into a narrows that leads into Lac Desty . I passed under a bridge ( another option for a put in on this route ) , and cast my line into the fast current , hoping for a walleye . Nothing biting , so I paddled on , passing a large campsite on the north side of the flow , just west of the bridge . <p> As I entered the narrows to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing boat . I saw one more boat a half an hour later and they where the last people I would see on this trip . I continued west through Desty , enjoying one of those rare days where any wind was on my back , slowly pushing me down the lake . Soon I entered Lac DArcy . Hap Wilson writes about this section of the park in his book about the Coulonge River . I 'm heading for an island campsite on Lac Giroux Hap describes , hopefully this tailwind will keep up . <p> After an easy paddle through DArcy , I enter Lac Giroux , and paddled due west for the large island ahead . The island is a great campsite , the water level is a bit low , so the beach out front is even larger than I expected . The site looks inviting , but I see another island closer to shore , so I paddle over to see what that looks like . Just as nice , a beach , a nice grassy spot for the tent with a table to boot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather be closer to shore should the wind blow in the morning . I set up my tent and then head over to a small windblown cove and gather some driftwood for the fire . I enjoy a nice steak , potato and squash dinner , along with a pot of 5 oclock coffee and finish off the evening solving the worlds problems with my pipe and a small fire . I made about 12km today . <p> Up early , well not really , the joy of solo paddling is you can do what you want , when you want and today I wanted to sleep a little more . I was on the water by 9:30 am. , heading up into the narrows that leads to Baie du Nord-Ouest , and my first portage . Since I am using topos only for this trip , I must find the portage by looking for a trail or marker where I think it should be . The Circuit maps that are available for most of the routes in the park are very good and with all the info they show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different , you have to find your campsites and the portages . I find the portage easily , there is some red tape on a branch and the trail is just visible from the canoe . <p> The portage starts as a steep climb for the first 75 meters , then levels off to an easy walk for about 300m , then a steep drop to the put in on Lac Strobile . I carried a #3 Duluth pack on my back and a large day pack on my chest to counter balance and started up the slope . Once to the top , I knew I had it made , and in no time I was back for the canoe . I had my beloved Wood Canvas Chestnut Deer and although heavy , I still find it manageable on the portages . I was paddling up Lac Strobile by 11:45 , trolling a green Daredevil and in no time I had a fish on . It was a pike in the 5-6 lb range , and the fight seemed like a lot bigger fish . I quickly took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . I caught and released a few more in the same weight range . I was in no hurry and feel it was one of my better fishing days . I still had some meat that I had kept frozen till the put in , so I did n't  eat fish that day . <p> I only found 2 campsites on Lac Strobile , both at the north end . Both had a steep climb up , both where in a stand of pine trees and offered nice views of the lake . I picked the one closer to the mouth of the Carriere Creek . It did n't  show sign of much use , I found plenty of wood in the area and some on the shoreline to make a small fire for dinner and coffee . After dinner I paddled over to the Carriere Creek and checked out the water level . I was concerned as most levels in the area where down and although the folks at Le Domaine said it was passable , I wanted to see for myself . It seem ok , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning . Back at the site , another cup of coffee and off to bed . <p> I got an early start , I was still concerned about the water level in the creek and wanted as much daylite as I could get in case I ran into any delays . I had to pull over a few beaver dams , but other than that it was an easy paddle the first 3km . Then I found out why there was so much water in a creek during a dry period . I rounded a bend and saw a new concrete bridge downstream , with a ten foot span for the water to run under . There was a beaver dam under the bridge that was 7 feet tall on the down stream side . The branches still had green leaves on them , and there was only a trickle of water flowing downstream . I walked the dry creek bed 200m and found the water level to be very low , not enough to even line a canoe . There was no portage trail at all and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creek bed . I walked back to the dam , and removed a 2x3 foot section of the dam to flood the creek . I then portaged around the bridge and waited while the creek rose a little . I walked my loaded canoe down the first 200m. of a rocky class 1plus section , then was able to paddle my way downstream from there . <p> The rest of the creek has 3 or 4 easy portages and was a nice paddle . I saw many tracks of moose and bear crossing the creek , and even a tree stand used for fall hunting before entering a marsh that would soon become Lac Carriere . As you enter the lake , there is a very nice camp site on the left ( west side of outlet ) . It was a clear sunny calm day and I slowly paddled east across the lake trolling a rapala and looking for a spot to camp . I could see a sandy beach off in the distance and started aiming for that . I passed a real nice site along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandy beach and was easy to spot with the big yellow triangle sign used to denote a campsite . I was soon at the beach and campsite I was aiming for and what a great place . It showed sign of heavy use , there is a road into this lake with the usual campsite/powerboat types and I would guess this spot sees lots of campers . It was fairly neat , and had a beach both out front and back . It had a long sandy point leading off the beach into the lake . This site is on the east side of the lake just behind the long island with the esker on the topo maps . It was a Monday in August and I had the place to myself , not a boat in sight . A friend later told me of camping here a few weeks earlier and having a momma bear and cubs walk through camp eating the blue berries off the many bushes and ignoring his group . I set up camp , ate a quick dinner , walked the beach , then did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island at dusk . <p> The next morning I got an early start . During the night the wind picked up and I wanted to get going before being stuck here for the day . I headed North for the outlet that flows into Lac Camitoga . I hugged the shoreline of Lac Carriere , making it a point to point paddle , using whatever I could to stay out of the wind . While paddling along the shore , I found an old canvas pack up in some rocks . It contained some rotted food , along with a brand new peak 1 gas stove and some canisters . I buried the food , hung the pack in a tree and kept the stove . No one reported it missing at Le Domaine , probably floated away from a capsize . <p> The chute at the entrance to the narrows that leads into Lac Camitogama from lac Carriere was a runnable class 1plus , so I paddled thru . There is a portage trail around it , best to scout this before running . As I rounded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a problem . I got down on my knees and dug in . My old beavertail paddle was holding up , I carry a spare , but just did n't  want to loose any ground should I have to switch . I inched my way up the 3km to the spot where you make a quick turn around a point and head in the opposite direction ( south ) 3km to the portage that leads into Lac Canimina . Ahhhh , a tailwind , what a sweet paddle it was down to the portage . Its a 400m portage into Lac Canimina around a rocky stream , but someone had cleared a path in the streambed to make a channel where you could float your loaded canoe upstream . It cut the portage in half . I saw no campsites on Lac Camitogama , but possible could have missed them . <p> The tailwind continued down Lac Canimina and I made 11km in no time . I passed a few average campsites along the way south , some in the narrows between the two main sections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by the south end of the lake . I found a nice one on the west side of the second biggest island , it showed heavy use . I stayed there for my last night and this time was lucky enough to catch a nice walleye before dinner . After an evening paddle in the now calm lake , I got to bed early , the wind had taken its toll on me . <p> I started a little late the next morning , it was sunny and calm and I was still feeling yesterdays paddle . I paddled south to the end of Lac Canimina and started the carry over to Lac Myon by noon . The low water level of Lac Myon would have made for a wade in the mud just to get the canoe floating and I could see the take out across this small lake looked just as bad , plus it went straight up hill . I turned around and walked back to the road I had crossed on the portage trail . This road led to my truck at Lac Nichcotea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear in the bush and walked back to the truck . I would recommend this rather than struggle with Lac Myon.

Note that water level on the Bay has been about 1-2 metres lower in recent years . <p> This route turned out to be surprisingly undocumented for one I thought would be more popular . As a result , I thought I 'd write it up here . <p> The idea was to make a little loop somewhat less ambitious than the " Big Loop " , plus to visit the crown land areas bordering the park on the west . <p> Campsite reservations were easily obtained about 5 weeks in advance of the trip for this route on the backside of Killarney . Ferry cost from Tobermory to reach the highway 6 access is $52.25 one way for two adults and one canoe on a car . The Widgawa lodge access is very pleasant with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear , plus free parking including any extra nights spent camping on crown land rather than in the park , plus they 're open late ( 11 pm I think ) for picking up your permits . They also had quite a few brand new Scott and Souris River canoes on hand which are likely available for rent . <p> We camped on crown land in Charlton lake and Iroquois bay . There are a few cottages and plenty of crown land , but we hardly saw any regularly used campsites ; be prepared to set a bush camp if you are stopping on either of those two bodies of water . <p> The north edge of Killarney in the Hanwood , Van Winkle and Cat lakes area is open to motorized access for customers of lodges on Bear Lake and Lang Lake . They have several boats cached on the portages and their customers pack in a motor and fuel . These hard-charging sport fishermen can get themselves three lakes deep in the park in this fashion , hopping from cache to cache . Never mind that the beat-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chained to the nearest tree . At least the boats have not been dumped right on top of the canoe put-in/take-out as they often are in Temagami . I asked one intrepid sportsman whether anyone would bother fishing here if they had to haul their own boat with them , but he did n't get the question . <p> The creek between Fish and Gem lakes is easy paddling in deep water with about 4 beaver dams to cross . The portage across the LaCloche range out of Little Mountain lake is a relatively flat and easy carry . The little pond between the P900 and P1200 is shrinking fast and a bit of a hassle lauching in deep soft mud . Kirk creek is deep with several beaver dams providing good flotation yet easy liftovers . There are no serious obstacles in here , indeed we saw numerous signs of recent trail maintenance throughout our route . <p> The three narrows shortcut portage appears now to be unmaintained however , and is more like 1200 metres with extensions at either end of the marked portage on the ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an odious place , where a loosely tied boot or even a small human could disappear into deep mud . <p> Kirk Creek downstream of the dam is a bit rugged with a half dozen liftovers and portages . It is a lot of loading and unloading in a short distance . Finally reaching the bay , you see the effect of lower water levels with an additional portage not shown on my 1990 park map , and it is all reeds and marshes here . <p> McGregor bay is an interesting maze of islands and inlets , which is not altogether overrun with motor traffic . Ole Evinrude staked a claim in this area years ago , so I ca n't complain about the powerboats too much I suppose . One nice variant in the parade of fishing rigs and houseboats sporting four-stroke VTEC engines was the tiny yachting dinghys and zodes putt-putting along barely faster than the canoe . <p> The passage from Iroquois bay to Storehouse bay is easy enough . The route follows a long narrow bay with two arms at the west end that looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the east , there are two short liftovers . At the fork of the " Y " , find a P200 going south into another section of Storehouse Bay . <p> To make the crossing from Storehouse to Bay of Islands , paddle around to the west towards the highway , and take a very small inlet to the south directly in front of the cottages . If any cottagers see you here , they 'll assume you 're lost or sorely misguided ; they are not aware that there is through passage here for water craft , since all small water craft are essentially equivalent to aluminum skiffs with outboards in their view . Here make a liftover , paddle a small pond , portage the highway , paddle a small pond , portage the abandoned rail bed and you are in Bay of Islands , at the fourth inlet south of Whitefish falls . <p> Be aware that some of the land between Iroquois bay and the highway belongs to the Whitefish River first nation . They request that canoe parties obtain prior permission from the band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitefish falls , the bridges and the dam is accomplished with a single carry of about 1km . At the base of the falls , find a landing on the west shore , carry up the earth bank towards a shaded cottages/resort area , avoiding the rocky area along the cataract . Follow the road out of the resort to Highway 6 , jog north 10 metres , take the dirt road 100 metres down to the railbed , turn north on the railbed some 400 metres , until you see the Frood lake on your right . ( If travelling south , reverse these directions . ) <p> A short paddle through Willisville then completes the loop . Oddly , we saw very few canoeists during our seven day trip which included the August long weekend , a total of just eight parties . Somehow I expected the place to be a little busier , given the stories one hears about how hard it is to get into Killarney during the summer . <p> Thanks to mrcanoe for providing me with a detailed description of the passage through Storehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of summarizing it here for purposes of this route description , because this route is a good one that is well worth doing . I got little help from the park ; when I called , staff refused to comment on any part of the route outside park boundaries , professing to have no knowledge of such areas whatsoever . If you need more information , I hope you have better luck with them than I did .

Poor Brigitte tried to stay on top of her back pain . She proved to be a very brave and patient person who mastered her disappointment of cancelling their trip extremely well . Too bad we had to miss the pleasure of doing a northern trip with two expert German kayakers and at the same time two kindred spirits . <p> After coming from the airport we did our final preparations to leave the next day . Then on Wednesday , August 8th we left our house at 7:00 a.m. , travelling past Whistler , Pemberton , Lilloet , Clinton , Hundred Mile House , Williams Lake and Quesnel , to Prince George . There we had a pleasant evening in Olaf 's and Andrea 's house and continued the next day towards Chetwynd . <p> The northern landscape unfolded in front of us , and again we felt that its pristine , but subtle beauty gave us a sense of freedom , releasing all of the tensions accumulated in the southern civilization . At 2:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office we asked if they knew someone who could store our vehicle and drive it to Fort Vermillion three weeks later . Wendy , one of the employees phoned her friend Tracy , who was willing to come down to talk to us . She was a woman of about forty who manages an apartment and had room to store our car there . <p> While we were waiting in the tourist office , Ted took a glance at the big BC map there and discovered the Pine River which passes close to Chetwynd and flows into the Peace River . If we canoed the Pine River first , Tracy would not have to drive us to Hudsons Hope . We went to the BC Government office and bought two maps of the Pine River . Then we went to the local pub for our last meal and last beer . Afterwards Tracy drove us to the Pine River . We unloaded all our gear and started paddling the river at 6:30 p.m. until we found a camp spot half an hour later . <p> The river seemed friendly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed many animal tracks , deer , elk , beaver and bear . We enjoyed some wine , and I started to read the book : " SEX i 'm Freien " which Werner had given us . The book was quite inspiring , and we had a super lovely evening . <p> Friday , August 10 <p> The Pine River started as a wide , fast river without any hurdles . We saw a few deer , and around 10:00 a.m. the sun started warming us . We had got up at 6:00 a.m. and were on the water at 8:00 a.m . Towards noon , we came to a canyon . The river narrowed and started rapid-like sections . The shores had changed from grassy banks to high rock walls with layers of sandstone and the odd protruding granite wall . We did paddle through at least two rapids with fairly high waves and over a mild ledge , and I got wet from my waist down . Twice we saw a farm with pastures along the river . Close to the hamlet of East Pine we saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of high hills that showed signs of huge landslides . Some were old and overgrown , and others quite recent . At 6:00 p.m. we set camp after 57 km . While we had supper , a little beaver swam across the river , totally scared of us . It had been a sunny , beautiful day to which we drank the remainder of our red wine . 57 km <p> Saturday , August 11 <p> We got up at 6:00 and left at 8:15 . During our breakfast we heard some coyote pups crying behind us . The fog on the hills slowly lifted and gave way to the morning sun . The aspen we passed on the shore showed already a trace of yellow leaves , an early sign of fall in this northern country . The river had many curves and bends in which the current usually ran faster . The river was widening here and had many low gravel bars on both sides . One shore usually had a very steep bluff which showed ancient and recent landslides , while the other shore was low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left shore , and shortly later saw a tent and two waving people . We stopped and found out that they were a German couple from Berlin who have been coming to the Pine River for the last 14 years to camp in the same spot . They even cooked with wood , no camp stove . We had tea with them and they gave us a German chocolate bar as a gift . Next year they want to buy a canoe from us . After an hour we continued into a beautiful sunny day . Later several jet boats came zooming up and down the river , spoiling the idyllic atmosphere . We saw many deer resting in the sun . At 5:00 p.m. we set up camp on a clean gravel bar . For supper we had our last fresh food from at home . Tomorrow our dry-food diet will start again . After supper the coyotes started howling across the valley with answers on the other side . 47 km today . <p> Sunday , August 12 <p> This morning we were again on the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the sun came out in all its glory . Later it became really hot . We saw several male deer and some beaver . At 9:30 a.m. we came to the end of the Pine River , hitting the waters of the Peace River . The Peace flows through a more civilized area , although there is plenty of wilderness left here too . The shores are not quite as steep and have lots of cracks and ravines in which aspen grow , protected from the rough elements . The river is wide , has lots of islands which create some confusing channels , and it flows fast . We took a side channel twice . While we were protected and surrounded by treed shores , we heard motorboats and loud music on the main channel . Three boats had come together from some distant hamlet to celebrate who knows what . Very close to this civilization noise , a moose cow and her calf grazed . Later we passed under a bridge where some years ago there had only been a ferry . We saw three more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so hot that we only paddled till 5:00 . I did some laundry in the river and had a full bath . 60 km today . <p> Monday , August 13 <p> We were on the water at 8:15 . The fog on the top of the mountains lifted within an hour and the sun was out and warming us . During breakfast a little speckled frog came to visit us . Last night when we were ready to fall asleep , we heard barking very close to our tent behind us . A coyote was so upset with us intruding into his territory that he barked off and on part of the night . Today was another beautiful summer day . After some time we saw the word " camp " painted on a rock wall and stopped to investigate . Climbing up the steep embankment , we saw a nice campground with washrooms and showers . This was Camp Cottillion , made for the northerners to enjoy . But there were no people , but we found a water reservoir and a Bonanza natural resource plant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water of the Peace River was brown and muddy and not suitable for drinking . On we went , passing several deer , one moose cow and her baby , and one beaver . After several hours we saw another sign of civilization in this otherwise wild landscape . It was a cabin on the high shore , hidden behind some trees . The cabin was surrounded with a lawn on which were some lawn chairs , a barbecue pit , a stove and fridge on the porch and a unlocked front door . We walked into a clean , modern cabin with several bunk beds , a book shelf , a table on which we saw a guest book . It said " welcome " and " help yourself to drinks " . This was a trapper cabin , but open to the public . How nice to find such hospitality ! According to the guest book , people had stayed here yesterday . We helped ourselves to a coke and then continued our trip because on such a nice day we would rather sleep in our tent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely cabins later on . In the evening we came to a set of islands which created narrow channels with very fast water . We camped on a gravel bar , went skinny-dipping and then had " happy hour " and supper . Another perfect day ! Ted and I are enjoying this easy trip and each other . 60 km <p> Tuesday , August 14 <p> At 8:00 it was cloudy , but soon the sun was out again with all its force . We saw an eagle who almost grabbed a duck . The victim complained a long time while it swam off . Ted spotted a log cabin high up in the bush . We climbed up and walked along a trail from the cabin , eating raspberries . Eventually we arrived at a public campsite , the Carter Camp . It even had a fenced playground , but nobody was there . Back on the water , the sun started beating us . We are tanning rapidly , and I have a hard time saving my skin . On the left shore we saw cows for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them wander here all summer which is actually against the law because of pollution . Later we found another empty campsite with playground and water pump . We camped a quarter to five on a ledge close to the river with cows mooing not too far away . As soon as our tent was up , we went for a swim to cool off . Then we followed our normal routine , i.e. happy hour supper and bedtime . 50 km <p> Wednesday , August 15 <p> Another sunny day as we paddled into a rapidly warming Ed. note : word missing . Before lunch we came to a deserted homestead , a small house with one room downstairs and one upstairs . The old furniture and outdated farm equipment were still there . How modest people were in the old days , just covering their basic needs ! They were certainly not as demanding as we are now . Today I did not prepare a pumpernickel sandwich for our lunch , because we knew that we would arrive at Fort Dunvegan at noon . When we arrived there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report the cows we had seen on the shore of the river . The museum shows old pictures of the fur trade and the native people . The fort closed in 1899 , but you can still visit the restored mission church and the refectorium . Our lunch in the Teahouse Restaurant fell flat , because they have closed down . The only food available was ice cream at the mini-golf snack bar , sold by a Mennonite woman . We bought tomatoes and cucumbers at the small farmers market and went back to our canoe to have pumpernickel with fresh tomatoes . The shores are not as steep and high any more and you can guess the farms up on top . One side of the river is usually steep and covered with bush all the way up , while the other side is flat with hills behind . We wanted to camp at five , but only found a suitable campsite an hour later . We unloaded , put up the tent and went for a swim . When I wanted to cook our daily soup , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hose was leaking and we have 80 km to the town of Peace River . Does that mean two days of cold drinks and raw food ? We took a late night hike up the mountain through bush , ravines and high grass . Ted thinks that we are travelling too fast . 45 km <p> Thursday , August 16 <p> We woke up from a loud and sharp cry of a coyote . It was time to get up into another beautiful day . We finally changed our watches to Alberta time , which we should have done three days ago . The first few hours we had quite a cool head wind . Around 11:00 we came upon a campground made of a strange stone structure . It was the Kieyho campsite , empty like all the others . Later we found and investigated a lodge belonging to Bob and Lois Allan . It contained several small cabins , horses , a cow and chicken . The owners were absent , and Ted snooped around and gave some food to the chicken in their pen . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearing when we approached . Farther down the river we saw a moose cooling off in the water , but he took off when he saw the canoe . Not too far from him , we watched a baby moose who did not know how to behave when he saw us , so he called for his mommy . As we were getting closer to the town of Peace River , there were more buildings along the river , here a farm house , there a little weekend cabin . Then we came by an unpaved road and a ferry that goes back and forth on demand . It looked like a small barge that is pushed by a tugboat . The last two hours the wind quit and the sun beat on us again and made us very tired . We found a campsite around 6:00 p.m. and had a dip right away to revive our spirits a bit . 59 km <p> Friday , August 17 <p> Today we only have 23 km to go to the town of Peace River . Ted wanted to stay close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River . There were several islands in front of it , and the Smoky seems to split its waters between them . It flows out of the Rocky Mountains and is quite big . Ted wants to paddle it one of these days . Around 11:00 a.m. we arrived in Peace River . It was already very hot . We walked along the main street and then went for a beer - Ted had two - and a nice meal . We had to buy either a new campstove or a part for the hose of ours . There was no sporting goods store in town , only Canadian Tire across the bridge up the hill . We decided to walk the few kilometers , although the locals told us that it is impossible , too far . It was so terribly hot around five o'clock that the walking became a real torture . On top of it Canadian Tire did not have what we wanted . We hitched a ride back into town , gathered our dirty clothes from the canoe and walked to a laundromat . Back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of red wine with pumpernickel and brie cheese . The night was noisy from all the frolicking in town and the car noises from the bridge . In the morning hours some thunder and rain relieved everybody from the excessive heat wave . 23 km <p> Saturday , August 18 <p> I finally fell asleep in the wee hours of the morning . Ted served me breakfast in bed . When I wanted to go for my morning routine , he said : " Watch out , two people are watching us from back there " . Later they came down to ask for money . They wanted to hitchhike either north or south to find work . It was already humid and hot . We bought some groceries and a clamp for the campstove hose . When we packed our gear , Ted accidentally damaged our water container . Luckily it happened now and not in the middle of nowhere . So we went back to the hardware store to buy the last one they had . A good water container was vital for us because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle and the one pulp mill on it . We finally pulled out of town at noon . Half an hour later we were back in the wilderness , exactly after one day of civilization . After two hours we came to a brand-new bridge over a new highway , both built for the pulp mill which causes a lot of pollution on the Peace River . Later we stopped at the " eternal flame " , a site where natural gas had been found and a flame ignited years ago . Nobody is able to extinguish it . Under the flame , water is pouring out and forming a creek which is covered with calcium deposit . This afternoon we saw another lonely campsite with a cooking shelter and two outhouses without doors . Who would want to climb up high over the shore and carry all camping gear up like that ? At our campsite Ted fixed our camp stove which works well now . He is really a very creative fixer of things , a great talent that was never allowed to develop into a profession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted caught his first fish of the year , a goldeye . While fishing , we watched two beaver , a mother and her baby , come to shore . This morning we left with a head wind into a grey morning . We investigated a small cabin whose owner had left his radio and other valuable things ; of course the door was unlocked . We saw a small bear scrambling up the embankment . Today the tourist boat from Island Tours passed us . We had already been looking for that island . Then Ted , who always sees things first , saw arrows pointing towards a trail . We landed and followed the trail to the island camp . There were cabins and a main building , a teepee and boardwalks . The camp cook , all alone , came out and invited us for coffee . We ate our lunch there . When we left , it had started raining , a gentle warm rain . We paddled a few hours until we saw three nice log cabins , new and modern on a big clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to greet us on his all-terrain vehicle . We were invited to his cabin which was filled with Bob 's relatives who seemed to have a party . We were served a whisky and later some fruit salad . Then we left into the rainy afternoon . Later a covered boat stopped and the couple , farmers , talked for a while with us until their boat almost grounded on the rocks . We set camp on a low gravel bar . I fried the fish from yesterday and we had a lively discussion on creation versus evolution and on religion . Such discussions can be stimulating to the mind as long as you respect the other 's opinion without trying to change it . It was a great Sunday . 45 km <p> Monday , August 20 <p> Because of a headwind we did not leave until 10:00 am . The sky was grey with some blue patches in the north . We investigated another lonely cabin . The door was open and there was a guest book on the table . A field of oats spread behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped at a modern weekend cabin with flowers , a sprinkler , toys , but nobody home . Then Ted spotted a bear down by the river . He must have heard us , because he soon hid behind some bushes . Around noon we came to the old house that Ted remembered as being deserted fourteen years ago . Now it had a new roof and a porch . We knocked on the door to find out its history . A young woman answered the door and invited us in after a while . She then prepared some lunch for us , fried potatoes and deer meat , tea and cookies . We stayed for three hours and were glad to be inside because a thunderstorm was raging outside . When we left , our host Jocelyn gave us some vegetables from her garden and some cookies . We continued down the river and stopped at a property where the only human traces in the bush were a sauna and a picnic table . It looked as if some wild parties are held here occasionally . It might sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of our visits to the cabins , but in reality we are mostly totally on our own . If anything happened to us , it would take hours to walk in order to find help . 47 km <p> Tuesday , August 21 <p> Last night when we sat safely under our canope , we had a short heavy downpour . A beaver swam back and forth in front of our camp to check us out . Today it was raining lightly when we started paddling into a headwind . The weather improved later on . We saw a flat boat , almost a small barge , anchored to two pegs on the shore of a small island . Up on top was an old cabin . Although nobody was there , the owner welcomed his guests with the sign " please use the toilet " . He must have had a problem with people using his bushes instead . Later we reached the border of Notikewin Provincial Park , a stretch of wilderness set aside by a former government . It was here that Ted had lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest farm for help . Our plan today was to reenact that walk and visit that same farm owned by Ian Meier . But Ted could not find the road down to the river . Had a flood washed it away one of these years ? We paddled three km down and then again back upstream to where we suspected a field behind a thick stand of aspen . It was a hard job to paddle upstream . Apparently some explorers such as Mackenzie had done it . Finally we had made it and found the old cabin where Ted and his wife had broken into spend the night after they had lost all their gear . Then we started to walk the thirteen km . We saw many moose tracks and bear droppings , about every hundred meters . After we had walked about seven km , a car came down the road . The driver was a German from Stuttgart who has settled close to Ian Meier . He had his car full of German visitors , but he offered to turn around and take us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ian remembered and recognized Ted , but he did not realize that Ted was here with a different woman this time . He and his wife Candy invited us for supper and drove us back later . We arrived on the river just in time to put up our tent on a gravel island before it got completely dark . 30 km <p> Wednesday , August 22 <p> We woke up to a windy and rainy day . The first hour of paddling was tough fighting against a north wind . The wind was with us till late afternoon , but the rain stopped at lunch time . We spent our lunchtime stop on the campground at the end of Notikewin Park . Landing and taking off is becoming very difficult at times because the shores are very muddy and you sink in as soon as you set foot on them . Around five o'clock we saw a good camping spot on a gravel island that stretches like a half moon into the river . The sun had finally come out and painted the whole river valley golden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see a moose coming out to drink . Later a second one and her calf came to the river . We had a wonderful and restful evening . 35 km <p> Thursday , August 23 <p> We left just when it started raining . It rained all day , sometimes heavily , until five o'clock . We had lunch in front of an old deserted cabin to which we had to climb up through thick brush . In the afternoon we paddled around many islands that had the same shape , a long flat gravel bar on one end , and a high muddy shore on the other . They all have a stand of high aspen in the middle , surrounded by dense shrubs . The shrubs on the slopes and along the river are starting to show some red and yellow fall colours . We saw an eagle attacking a swimming goose with his claws . The goose continued swimming . We chased her for a while , hoping to catch an easy prey for our supper . But it dived over and over again until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a wolf on the far shore , and a moment later a snorting moose jumped out of the bush and swam across the river , making snorting sounds the whole time . Around four pm , Ted spotted a green level patch high above the river . Coming closer , we saw cabins , picnic tables and a path down to the river with a hand railing all the way . We stopped and walked up to the camp . Nobody was there , but in the open kitchen shed some meat and potatoes were still on the barbecue . There were three outfitter tents with beds , a tool shed , a big roofed barbecue with benches around , a running water system from a creek , a tub full of beer and some other booze high on a shelf . While we were under the kitchen shelter , it started raining heavily and we were glad not to be on the river . Would the owner come back today because he had left all that meat on the barbecue ? Ted decided nevertheless to stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like to use other people 's facilities in their absence . But the laws of the north are a bit more flexible , and besides , when Ted has made up his mind , nobody can deter him . So we put our sleeping bag on one of the beds and Ted made a fire in the little wood stove . In the dusk we saw a moose and her calf on the opposite shore . The calf romped with joy like youngsters of all breeds do . There was a beautiful sunset over the river . During the night it rained again heavily and we were glad to be warm and dry . 33 km <p> Friday , August 24 <p> We left the hunting camp into a day of sunshine . However , the sun did not have the same warmth any more . It seemed that summer was over and fall had begun . After three hours we saw two cabins high up on the mountain . They were already part of the Metis settlement of Carcajou . Later we landed on the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses in front of a big grass field . A group of men greeted us and we found out that one of them was the owner of the hunting camp . He was about to leave for that very camp to prepare it for the hunting season which starts on the first of September . We did not tell him that we slept in one of his cabins . Of course we had left it in immaculate shape . Then we continued our journey towards Old Carcajou . The sky looked forboding with showers in the distance . Now and then gusts of wind chased down the river . Once we stopped to let them pass . Stepping out of the canoe in Old Carcajou was very difficult , because of a soft , black mud bank . Ted criticized me for not jumping out of and into the canoe fast enough over the rocks . Well , Mr. Longlegs , that 's easy for you to say ! Old Carcajou is an old Mennonite settlement that got flooded and was abandoned . There were old log houses , sheds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorcycle was in it . An old Ford truck was parked , the key still in it , and Ted tried to start it . The mud on the shore prevented us from camping here . We paddled till 7:30 pm until we finally found a spot suitable for camping . Today we had our last " happy hour " , tea with vodka . 60 km <p> Saturday , August 25 <p> Last night at dusk the geese made a show for us . Flocks of geese came from all directions , circling in various formations , and honking while flying . This lasted for half an hour , until they all settled down on a large sand bar for a big goose pow-wow . This morning we saw a bear standing at the water 's edge , drinking . Then he disappeared into the curtain of green shrubs . But soon he came back to walk in the shallow water , until he caught a fish . Then he ran back into hiding to devour his prey in private . It was sunny and windy . Around noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road from High Level with the town of La Crete and also with Fort Vermillion . We had lunch at a campground close to the ferry . There we met a German couple who were travelling in a camper . They had been to Canada many times . We spent an hour with them . Later the sun was nice and hot , so that we could take off our shirts . Once we got stuck in the sand of the river . I got out and pulled Ted through the water . We camped on a high sand bar . It was hot enough for us to take a full bath . 45 km <p> Sunday , August 26 <p> A nice cloudy morning with the sun peeking through here and there . We saw a wolf with light and dark brown stripes walking along the shore . Later we came to a road going to the river . Going up , we found an old crude log cabin in the bush . Half an hour later we came to a wider road down to the river . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ km to the top of the hill through deep aspen forest . What a surprise above : Huge wheat fields and a farm house in the distance . We continued walking when two all terrain vehicles ( ATV ) were heading in our direction . They were driven by two teenagers , a boy and a girl . We talked a little bit and learned that all these fields belong to Mennonite farmers . The two invited us to visit their parents ' house - they were brother and sister . We hopped on the back of their vehicles , and off we went through mud and rocks passing fields and farm houses , almost flying and feeling a bit uneasy about this mode of transportation . A bit shaken , we reached a nice yard with a white house and rose bushes in front of it . The mother came out , wearing the typical Mennonite headdress , a small black kerchief . She introduced us to five of her seven daughters , all in nice Sunday dresses . Her husband joined us for tea and cake . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mennonite community and up to Buffalo Hill , the highest point of the landscape . From there we had a splendid view across the huge valley of ripe fields and green pastures dotted with farm houses . Our hosts , Mary and John Krahn , also manage a store along the road to La Crete . On the way back , they opened the store for us and offered us some presents from the souvenir corner : two baseball caps , a pocket mirror , a pen and a letter opener with the inscription " Buffalo Head Prairie " . Back at the farmhouse , Mary gave us a package of frozen moose steaks and a bag of homemade buns . They drove us back to our canoe around 4:00 pm . We paddled till 8:45 pm and camped on a sand bar . Behind us was a swamp hidden by a hedge of willow bushes . The mosquitoes were very happy with our presence . 37 km <p> Monday , August 27 <p> Today is our last day out in the wild before we come to Fort Vermillion tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here the river makes a huge loop in such a way that two stretches of river run almost parallel with only a mountain in between . The river slows down and paddling is more of an effort . We ate the buns Mary Krahn had given us . We also walked in the bush above the river . There were ATV trails , but no fields . The sun came out later , but it was windy . We camped on the sandy shore of a long island . I fried part of the moose steak with onions from Mary 's garden and mashed potatoes . It was so good , but cooking was difficult because the wind blew fine sand into everything . After supper , we tried to walk across the island . It had been flooded earlier in the season . The soil was hard and cracked , and the willow bushes were very dusty from the dried out mud that hung in the branches . It was easy to lose orientation under the man-high reeds and dense shrubbery . Ted found the way across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sank in ankle-deep . There were many animal tracks here . Bears , deer , moose and wolves had crossed here to find food on the other side of the lake-like puddles . During the night we could hear a combine far in the distance , harvesting before the frost arrived . 42 km <p> Tuesday , August 28 <p> We got up in the middle of the night to admire a spectacular northern light show . In the morning , I fried two steaks of the moose meat for our lunch sandwiches , the last lunch of this trip . We passed several islands on the thirty-km stretch we still had to paddle to reach Fort Vermillion . Our lunch spot was on the foot of steep stairs leading up the shore to a cabin in the bush . The shore was very untidy with various household articles lying around . Several unattended homemade fishing rods were propped up along the river and got tangled in our canoe . Then we were awarded the big excitement of the day : Ted had spotted a big black thing moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the river . We paddled as hard as we could to have a closer look . We managed to pass him close to the shore and watched as he quickly ran up to the bushes in fear . He briefly turned around to get a close look of his pursuers before he disappeared into the bush . As we paddled on , we heard some sandhill cranes calling in their silly manner . They reminded me of our Tundra trips where I had first heard them . Around the next river bend we saw the bridge that leads to Fort Vermillion . Only seven more km and we have completed our trip ! Then finally at 2:00 pm we landed on the shore of Fort Vermillion , a north Alberta community of nine hundred souls . First we headed towards the only pub to enjoy a beer and a meal in a restaurant . Then we washed our laundry in the laundromat . Now it was time to phone Tracy , the woman we had hired in Chetwynd to store our camper-truck and to drive it the seven hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she manage to arrive here safely tomorrow ? We had sometimes worried about this during our trip . But yes , we reached her , and yes , she would be here tomorrow . Relieved , we found a good spot to camp on the river , hidden by a dense stand of trees and shrubs . We retired into the tent with a bottle of red wine to celebrate our safe and successful journey . The sky rewarded us with a glorious sunset , and the sandhill cranes were calling in the distance . 30 km <p> We had paddled 832 km in 17 1/2 days , grateful to be blessed with the strength and health to do such a trip at our age . This trip has been peaceful and relaxing and free of any hair-raising wild experiences , and Ted and I have had a wonderful time together .

The water level is very high , as shown by the docks under water , and no visible " high water " mark on the rocks . Even here at my campsite , the fire pit is half under water ! I got to the most southerly island of Nine Mile Lake at approximately 11:30am , and had lunch ( bagel , pepperettes , cheese , apple ) .

Here , the snowmobile trail clearly goes across the pond ( when it 's frozen of course ) and the " foot " trail goes through the bush just barely skirting the pond , and in some cases climbs up along a small cliff on the east side of the beaver pond . The " foot " trail never gets far from the main snowmobile trail , and joins back up in places . Soon , Wolf Lake appears , and the trail ends .

Words truly cant describe the feeling one gets standing there watching and wondering . <p> Lots of photos taken.Nick and Arnie continue to hike up the Pekans while Don and Gene go back to fish for speckled trout .

It has really grown and changed , new respect is require with her . 8K we paddle with a fast current and no rapids . A great set of R2-R3 make for some great fun . We push hard to make our camp site at mile mark 218 which is at the end of a long still section . The wind kicked up and we witnessed a water spout maybe 159 200ft tall . Very very cool . <p> The rest of the paddle for the day consisted of R1 , followed by 2 -R3 's the second should really be a R4 .

Lots of effort with little gain . <p> We portaged around a R5 , paddled R1 's and some swifts . The mountains are really big now . elevation from water to top of cliffs is 700 to 1000 ' according to the contours . It really is spectacular scenery . waterfalls tumble down the faces of shear faces . It really is pristine , untamed wild , wilderness . Birds continue to entertain us , ducks we chase down stream , osprey circle above or sit in perches high above the water . <p> We turn a corner and in the distance 5 tiny waterfalls tumbled over the edge of the rock cliff face and disappear into the forest of black spruce . Every now and then dotted by the yellow of aspen turning their fall colours .. <p> Another perfect long campfire.Time to enjoy the day with a cigar and stars . <p> Day 14 Sat . marker 194 to 162 on the water 9.10 off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less to say about the water.Dozens of waterfalls along the way one starts not to even notice them.We have an R1 followed by a R3 .

We eat lunch and drift along , drifting through a swift . We run a R3 with care followed by a bunch of swifts . The current I estimate flows at about 10K an hour here.We stop on an island just past River Caopacho . No luck with the fishing . Big campfire and a cigar .

Do n't buy cheap crap from crappy tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and you need it to survive.I go back to my own wooden paddle . We get to the fish ladder and decide to take the left side portage which is shorter . Real challenge to get up the first part of the trail and the end is on an old rotted wood structure about to fall into the water.Very hazardous as Nick finds out as the rail collapses as he unloads the pack to the ground over the side.We still had the canoes to get . Probably the hardest portage Ive ever had.Not fun.The woodland were very interesting , lots of bright green moss very lush growth .. <p> I followed Arnie up one part where he crawled up the trail on his knees . I took the canoe on this portage as Nicks knee are failing him . I struggle with it all and feel the heart rate rapidly rise , so I slow things down to ease the effort . I really feel my age today but with a couple rests along the way we get her done . <p> We paddle on for another 5K to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The map elevation indicates it towers 1700 ft above us . Truly inspiring and spectacular scenery that mesmerizes you . You would think Shagrila could n't be any better than this as we cast our gaze up and down the river you catch waterfalls tumbling off shear rock faces . Tough site to find firewood but we manage.Darkness swallows up the valley and we are ready for sleep . <p> We start the day with a glorious sunny a breeze that blows in our face for most of the day . The first challenge is a tough R3 Nick and I manage to work our way downtime right side , without a spray skirt trying to stay out of the big stuff.We take on some water but stay upright and bail out.Don and Arnie follow us down . They have alternated sterning duties each day but paddle the same side each day and all day . Nick and I are constantly switching sides . In the really big stuff Nick has better control paddling on his right . Makes no matter to me but I do have more power on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long R2-R3 with some big waves , we take on some water but manage to navigate our way without problems . A R1 followed by another and them 1.5K of R1 followed by a long tough R3 . What a ride , no clear route so constant last second decisions as we go along makes it rather exciting . Taking on a lot of water makes handling the canoe very tough with all the weight of the water.But we keep it straight and carefully ease out on the right side and bail out . Don and Arnie follow us downand ease out to bail as well . <p> By far the best ride of the trip . Wow ! ! ! Another long R1 followed by another and then a swift and a R2 . We raft up for lunch and are amazed how fast the current sucks us along as we cover a lot of river quickly . <p> A leisurely paddle follow for the rest of the way . We pass one of several outfitters . Looks very clean neat and tidy as they have all packed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnage of a wrecked outfitter canoe . Another upside down half in and half out of the water . A reminder that this river can mess you up if you let your guard down and do n't pay attention . <p> We paddle on and stop to look at a potential campsite , Don gets out to inspect , but it is n't up to our high standards so we continue on to the next island at 92K mark . <p> One of the best sites so far . Loads of firewood everywhere , beautiful sandy beach . Fishing is terrific Don is catching some nice trout . I head across the river to some really big boulders and fish amongst them . 8 trout 5 I keep for dinner and breakfast . Arnie trys his luck at some climbing but the terrain is awfully tough and very steep . <p> Another long campfire with speckled trout and cous cous . <p> capachino and a cigar to finish the day . What a great day it was . But the clouds are rolling in . What will tomorrow bring ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 53 <p> Early start after pancakes , bacon , and speckled trout . We head off in a light mist which lasts the better part of the morning.Mostly swifts and an R1 . We get invited into shore by a pair of local native hunters for coffee and freshly made donuts by their wives . Maurice and his long time friend Edward who is 77 , has been hunting here all his life . He was born just up river . We sit and chat about the river and they show us their success with the moose hunt . The ladies show me how they use all the parts of the moose.They seem to enjoy hearing about our adventure.We all have an appreciation for this wild country . <p> We thank them for their hospitality , coffee and donuts and make our way downstream . We pass several more camps . A nasty head winds beats on us . We finally get to our campsite at the end of a crazy portage.Why is it that for every 2 meters forward you must climb 1 meter . This one is straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run by locals to assist with the effort . <p> Nick and Arnie explore the hugh boulder cliff strutter next to the river and get a great view of the R4 rapid . Really should be a R5 as it really ca n't run run with out serious risk to life .. Fishing is futile despite being the ideal location . Big camp fire as usual , the big moon is getting fuller each night.The meals towards the end of our tripare less appetizing but satify the hunger.Must be a cigar night.Scotch for Nick and Don . <p> We 'd Day 18 Cold and rain . 53k mark to 20K mark <p> Hot oatmeal with cranberries and raisins with pressed cup of coffee starts the day.Early start as it is raining . Its an easy day of paddling finished off with a tricky R3we take down the right side , taking on some water despite our skills . During the day we follow the railway now and see several very long iron ore trains . <p> We set up camp and hike up the slope to the railway track and hike 4k @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face tomorrow . R5 then an R2 , R3 plus 2 more R3 then a really big R3-R4. hugh standing waves 7 to 8ft in height with wide gaps in between . the problem is that they are constantly moving and changing shape . There is so much water . Yes I am very apprehensive for the next day.This will undoubtfully be the toughest day of paddling . 5 k of constant rapids.We take pictures and head back . no trains .. <p> We make and eat dinner , its pretty quiet as we each seem to have our own thoughts about tomorrow.A long train rumbles past.Cous cous and tuna and a serving of chilli . Another great fire . <p> Thursday day19 Sunny and gorgeous 20k mark to the take out at the highway . <p> Cold cereal and coffee and we are the water by 8.30 .

Third wave and I know we are in trouble . too much water . Over we go and drag our ass to shore . I learned something here though use your paddle to paddle to shore works amazingly well . Don and Arnie with the spray skirt fare better and manage to get through it . We all regroup just before the big left turn under the tressel bridge take a few pictures and Don and Arnie head out trying to get over to the left side so that they can make the left turn on the inside of all the crap.I watch in awe as they are pushed right down the right side and up against the cement base of the bridge . They had no effect on the water as there is too much power.They manage to get through though and continue down the last R3 and pull out on the island and wait for us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst as we head into the melee .

We look downstream . Arnie and Don are not is sight as we still have half a k of R3 to fight through . We look downstream and decide the right side is the best for us . <p> Things are going along ok till 2 large rock appear right in front of me . I freeze unable to decide to go left or right .

@@107413279 @2813279/ 134052 @qwx994052 134053 @qwx994053 <h> Clipper Tripper <p> Versatile , fast and stable , the Tripper was first introduced in the Spring of 1983 . It quickly became Western Canoeings most popular canoe . Its been one of the most popular choices in the Pacific Northwest . That 's quite a feat when you consider the wide selection of excellent models we manufacture . The Tripper is perhaps our most versatile boat . It is equally at home on large lakes and rivers , in moderate whitewater or open ocean . The Trippers modest rocker allows for quick maneuverability , yet very few correction strokes are required to keep it on course . Its ample capacity will carry a family with kids or all the gear you need for an extended wilderness trip . The Tripper has become the favourite for paddlers on BCs popular Bowron Lake canoe route . For several years the B.C. Summer Games Committee has used the Tripper as their competition boat because of its speed and dependability . Hows that for promotion ! The Tripper has introduced a new level of comfort to the recreational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are mounted low . The stern paddler is fitted with an adjustable footbrace . These features eliminate the need for kneeling . The Tripper has nearly straight stems , a keelless hull and 1 1/2 " of rocker . Its shallow arch hull flares out gently at the bow and stern . In the centre , a touch of tumblehome allows paddlers to reach the water easily . The Tripper glides between paddle strokes with little loss of speed . A popular option for wilderness paddlers is a spray skirt , or spray deck . The deck provides protection for paddler and gear when travelling in waves or poor weather . You can order the Tripper in the laminate of your choice : fiberglass , Kevlar or Ultralight Kevlar . <p> Rating 10/10 " based on what the boat was design for . I have had a fiberglass Tripper for 13 years . I have used it for everything from easy day paddles to eight-day trips ( and could have gone longer ) . It has been in some narrow , twisty , sweeper-rich foothills streams here in west-central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large river trips ( Athabaska , North Saskatchewan , etc. ) to large lake travel in northern Saskatchewan . Streams and rapids varied but my Tripper has been through tight , technical class 2 streams and rapids even up to easy class 3 . I have even tried to play in some rapids . It is not a whitewater play-boat . It is not a boat to go and mess about in a rapid . If that is what you want then do n't choose this boat . Eddy-turns require either a wider angle or you should set into the eddy . It is very scary to try to surf in it but it ferries and sets very well . I do n't believe that any boat can do everything well but the Tripper does what Clipper says it will do , very well and if you can set , it will do much more . I have paddled with other people who were using a variety of other boats over the years . Many of them were paddling " Prospector " style canoes . Most of them were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performance of the Tripper over this time has made reluctant believers out of them . I have gone through the same rapids , down the same twisting rivers and across the same windswept lakes . They ca n't understand how this boat can do all the things that it does but they have witnessed its performance and ca n't deny it . I have not only been able to keep up with these people in the technical parts but in easier river sections or on lakes , I have to be careful not to leave them behind . If you add wind into the equation then the Tripper comes out ahead every time . Contrary to some opinions expressed on this site , this is a very stable boat and becomes more stable with a load . The tractor-style seats are the most comfortable , over the long-haul , of any seats I have ever tried " and I have tried a number of others . I like these seats so much that I took the contoured wooden/cane seats out of my Swift Dumoine and replaced them with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and are very comfortable to sit in on the easy sections . ) If you want an easy-paddling boat that can carry large loads and that can be used for nearly any application ( except playing around in rapids ) , then I would highly recommend the Clipper Tripper . For most people , for the most common paddling conditions ( unless you play in rapids ) , the Tripper is a wonderful boat . <p> I reviewed this product before , and gave it a rather low rating . My rating seemed to be promptly removed , as it may have lacked truly constructive criticism . My apologies , and therefore , I currently assign this canoe about an 8of10 ( about the current average ) . I do however , continue to have a number of concerns about this canoe . For starters , the one thing that I find most annoying about the standard features of this canoe , and many other canoes from clipper ( although the tripper seems to be the most popular model ) are the rediculous tractor tire type seats . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and form fitting , do n't allow you to adapt your seating position a great deal , and in the long run , are very uncomfortable . My second major concern with this canoe is its instability . If there 's one thing I will give the clipper tripper , it is that it has a fairly narrow , sleak design which makes it an excellent flatwater canoe , for day paddling . I do n't however feel that the CT is particular adept to ' tripping ' as its name implies . In fact , the boat has coined a nickname by the buddies as the Clipper Tipper . It is an excellent boat to hone your whitewater skills because any wrong move will usually result in you taking an early swim . And , as eluded to in previous reviews of this product , the boat is kinda small all around . It sometimes feels like climbing into a kayak . Again , something a bit more suited for paddling around on a saturday with the kids . At any rate , Clipper makes a good product in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its just not much of a ' Tripping ' or a whitewater boat . robpw <p> My Clipper is 12 years old . It is the ulralight model with foam core bottom . This canoe is fast &amp; has great load capacity , though the low seats reduce storage space somewhat . It did several trips with 2 adults , 3 preteens &amp; total load over 700 pounds . Stress marks quickly appeared around the foam core bottom but have n't caused any problems . The layer of S-glass over the kevlar delaminated in places on the bottom after years of sun exposure &amp; running over beaver dams &amp; rocks . It is n't the most maneuverable boat around but will eddy turn nicely . It can be difficult to trim to prevent weathervaning if the bow paddler is a lot lighter than the stern paddler . The low seats are great for those of us who ca n't kneel . It has great final stability . <p> The Clipper Tripper is almost everything Clipper claims . It could be easier to turn , but was n't intended for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impair its impressive speed . We 're not powerful or skilled paddlers , but our typical cruising speed is 4mph . The hull above the waterline has modest tumblehome behind the center and flare in front . The hull below the waterline appears to me to be symmetrical . The construction looks flawless . Some construction and material details can be found in Clipper 's web site . Contrary to claims on the Internet that foam-core kevlar boats will develop stress cracks around the perimeter of the foam core , ours shows no such deterioration . There is absolutely no oil canning . The bottom of the foam core is , however , more susceptible to damage than the ribbed fibreglass construction . Standard build ribbed Tippers in heavy service have had their ribs separate . Heavy duty layups are available for all models . The exposed rivet heads on the sides of the hull can hurt your hands . Our rear footbrace is not telescopic , and therefore can not be adjusted for leg length . The low-mounted seats certainly enhance stability , but most paddlers wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you ca n't stow much gear under them . The seats , however , can be mounted higher at the factory . The tractor-style seats prevent you from sliding over against the gunnell , but the optional sliding bow seat allows trim adjustment . The canoe has to be rinsed out after salt water use or the aluminum rivets will corrode away . In the face of rampant kayaking , we 're always surprised by the compliments our black-trimmed white kevlar Tripper ( just like the picture ) gets from other canoe owners , kayakers and even power boaters.

Banks appear and the spruce forest returns . Campsites are much more numerous . Fallen logs pose a bigger problem than beaver dams in this next 20 miles . Often the jams were so complex that complete carries on the shore were necessary to circumvent them . The number of beaver dams requiring liftovers declined and may short runnable rapids occurred . None were marked on the map , but all were runnable . Brook trout live in the headwaters and some time should be spent fishing for them in this section . <p> The next 25 miles free the river of fallen logs and the river approaches 100 ft. in width . Rapids gradually increases in intensity during this section , but most if not all are runnable . <p> The next 35 miles see the river complete its fll off the Canadian shield . The river drops some 600 ft. in 35 miles . This calculates to a drop of 17 ft. per mile which would indicated that the river was not runnable . But the Wakwayowkastic is eminently runnable . <p> Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big drops between 10 and 30 ft. apiece . However the drops are clean . They are not preceded by unrunnable rapids and can be canoed fairly close to the lip of the drop . This very scenic section of the river will take 3 to 4 days to work through because of the carries . Campsites are numerous and spectacular . The river in this section is pristine - not often traversed by boats going either upstream or downstream . Portage trails are not well marked and did not indicate much evidence of use . however , they were on the side of the river a canoeist going downstream would expect . If the portage was not over the bare rock next to the drop in very instance it was on the side towards which the river bent . <p> One carry in particular in the sets of rapids above the junction with the North French River involved an uphill climb of 50 ft. vertical and then a carry along the ridge top to the end of the rapid . It was impossible to carry the canoes up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be snaked around a tree to hold the canoe during pauses while it was being manhandled up the steep slope . This will be the low point of the trip . On every canoe trip there seems to be this same natural progression . In the first stage , difficulties increase at some rate roughly proportional to your growing competence . As you get stronger , leaner , more work-hardened , the river becomes stronger , bigger and more dangerous . In the second stage you peak in conditioning but the river continues grinding you down . Clothes get ripped . Hats and gear are expected as tribute . River obstacles no longer help condition you but take reserves of patience and will husbanded over the winter . Then the third stage arrives . <p> Will the work never end ? Mile and a half carries , long lining episodes , portage trails flanked by soaked bushes . Once this stage is passed , the rest of the trip seems like a day outing . Easy to handle because the difficulty levels decrease while your competence level remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are trying to get the canoes up that slope . <p> Eight miles above the junction with the North French River the Wakwayowkastic completes its descent off the Canadian shield . Rapids from here to the junction with the Moose River are mainly shallow runs where the river fans out in broad sweeps around islands . Route finding is not tricky and the scenery is still very pretty with a more open appearance to the landscape . The shore is now composed of sedimentary deposits of the Tyrell sea loaded with fossils . On every trip one of our habits is to select a fossil from the limestone to take home . It is our way of keeping in touch with the river . <p> At the junction with the Moose River there is an Indian reservation on the right bank . It is well worth a stop to see the use of tepees and winter cabins . These are the homes of the Cree Indians when they are running their trap lines . If you stop , the law of the wilderness must be obeyed . Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at The possessions are needed for winter survival . They are not abandoned gear . The Indians did n't  lose it , and you did n't  find it . At the time of your visit the reservations more than likely will be deserted . Most Indians opt to spend the summer when the fur is no good in Moosonee or Moose Factory . <p> From the reservation is is a further 12 miles to Moosonee and the end of the trip . The Moose River is big and awe inspiring . When leaving the North French River it seems as if you are paddling over the edge of the world as water dominates the whole horizon in front of the canoe . No further example of the great possibilities is necessary that to see your canoe cross the immense ocean that is the Moose River . <p> I have paddled the Wakwayakastic in early June and found very good water levels . Nothing was shallow and scrapy . We did not experience any mile and a half portages . Our group choose to line some of the drops that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David led a group of 6 down this river starting 01Jul05 . If we had gone a week later we might have walked the whole way . Water levels were low and we bumped and scraped a lot of the way . Bugs were not a real problem . We had frost on day 2 ! and then 7 days of high 80s and 90s . Fishing was moderate . Water falls were great . June would seem to be the ideal month for this river . Made it in the 9 days , but that included some days of 40K and some of 6K in the middle . The start ( after the lake ) is incredibly difficult and hard to stay with . <p> I just completed the Wakwayokastic River ( June 28-July 5 , 2008 ) with high water from a very rainy June . Rapids were very runnable and fun , bugs very thick , rained every day . DO N'T run this river in low water , as the rapids will then become a drag ( literally ) . The guidebook George Drought recommends is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly experienced canoeists and GPS , we could not locate the marked campsites indicated in the guidebook , only grown over clearings not suitable for camping ( Except at the Devil 's Punch Bowl ) .

The trail is kind of obstructed by a cedar tree , but it heads up a steep ridge ( near some cached boats ) and then descends . At one point you will intersect with the ATV trail , bear left towards the lake . Easy peasy . There are some cottages on Whiskey , but much of the lake is undeveloped , especially in the south . Minimal campsites here , through there are plenty of small points you could easily pitch a tent on .

It goes through a blowdown decimated area . I abandoned whatever trail there was and hucked north to a valley which had less disturbance and then found may way to the river again . It was n't the original put in and I ended up wading down some rapids before reaching calmer waters . The old growth through here was stunning , which was the only redeeming factor of this slog !

For strong experienced paddlers , these boats provide lots of fun but they lack the versatility of a true tripping boat . Make no mistake , Quetico is a fast touring boat , but it offers some bonuses . It has more stability , more volume , and more seaworthiness than defrocked racing boats . For serious flatwater paddling , Quetico is a welcome addition to the canoeing scene . <p> An excellent lake triping boat . With effecient stroke mechanics the boat flat out moves . What I love about this boat is that it also turns on a dime . This is not a begginer boat . It feels rather tender ( empty especially ) and I do n't take any inexperienced paddlers who are comfortable in it . We use ours as our family tripper . Stuff 3 kids ( we have a third seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can overload this boat and still have lots of free board left . Does ok in up to easy class 2 but definitely is a flatwater boat as it is likes to cut through haystacks instead of riding over . An excellent boat for experienced paddlers with efficient stroke mechanics . Sloppy inexperienced paddlers do not like this boat they cant make it " go straight " and it feels to tender . Excellent lake water tripper . <p> Well no canoe is a 10 - Like Scotch its all good just different characters . My Quetico is a cedar strip that I built this past summer . Its been used in lakes and on 1 week class 2 river trip . Overall a good modern design that chooses fast and manouverable as its design goals . As a stripper it was built light ( 60lbs painted ) , but has proven to be tough enough . I would n't change anything in the design . After being surprised at the lack of tracking ( in an 18+ footer ) I adjusted and came to like the flexibiltiy this gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on lakes I load a little bow heavy and it tracks pretty darn well . On another site a reviewer said he felt he was paddling uphill referring to the rocker . While I understand this feeling , I think it is corrected by weighting the bow a little more than " usual " . This greatly improved tracking , and speed . The hull is probally fast enough to compete with some on the slower race boats , but the rocker does make force more turning input . The stern is nice and low for sit and switch paddling ; the bow a little high . I built mine with sliders for both seats , which is a variation from the plan , but I think this was a good idea as it gives me more flexibitly in trimming the boat . . The design manouvers very well : slideslips well , spins easily ( maybe too easily ) , carves pretty well . It is the most manouverable 18+footer I 've been in . It is also pretty fast . Not raceboat fast , but faster than some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ride ( stability ) is quite refined . Its very even and progressive until it goes and you have a nice lively feel . In other words its not a pig and you can lean the boat and learn its limits with some confidence if you are n't intimidated by the fact that it is going to respond to your weight shifts . In whitewater is takes on water amidships when heavily loaded 650 -750 lbs ( DUH ! ) . The bow slices through waves very cleanly rather than climbing them . This is great on a lake but in rapids it is sometimes uhmm ..... " not helpful " Running rapids empty it was very dry . The canoe has more space for load than it has displacement capacity . This is actually a benefit once you realize it and try not to fill it up . Mine is set up to handle 4 barrels so I get plenty of floatation as a bonus ! . I think I will add a spray skirt . The lower cut midsections are great for paddling , but also for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think this is a very accurate number . More than 150 lbs either way and the handling really changes . I was looking for a big boat for fast tripping , training , and cottage transportation . The Quetico answers each of these needs as a 9 out of 10 . With 4 paddlers at the cottage we move ! For tripping it is great for 2 , OK for 3 . For training , it needs a little too much steering input to be really satisfing . I 'm happy with the compromises though . John Winters has produced a very good design , and Green Valley provided very good plans and support . <p> I built this model as a cedar strip and have taken it on quite a few trips this summer . I have also built the Winisk , the Kipawa and the osprey from this line , and I must say that the Quetico is my favorite . I think it handles better than the Winisk , and i have yet to go on a trip long enough to fill it up with gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and i 'm really pleased with it 's performance . I do n't know about the Swift layups , but as a cedar strip built to withstand fairly rough tripping , it comes in at about 65 pounds and looks gorgeous ! <p> I have the ultralight Kevlar layup , weight was within a pound of what Swift claims ( 53 lbs . ) . I bought the canoe in the spring of 2000 when they were first released . First impressions on paddling the canoe around were : - it turns quite well considering its length , no doubt due to the rocker at both ends - it tracks quite well , even in side winds - it oilcans a lot ... A phone call to Swift and they responded that they had layup problems ( too little resin ) and would fix the canoe no cost , I just had to get it to them . After looking at a similar " fix " for a friend 's Winisk I decided I could do a better job myself . One large patch of fiberglass with West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my whitewater boats , I even managed a very smooth piece of work . I believe I have added about just over a pound to the original weight . In addition , I added small strips of material to the bow and stern to protect the canoe from those occasional run-ins with rocks at landings . The canoe is quite fast considering its seaworthiness ( my previous canoe was a Wenonah so I have some experience with flat-out water-borne rockets ) and cruises between 6-7 km/h ( as measured on my GPS ) without much effort . The Winters design , with rocker , has proven itself on very big waves and wind in La Verendrye several times . This is the boat you want if you 're tripping on big water ! I 'm not sure what the load capacity is but I do n't think I 'd want to carry that much over any portage ! We 've had 8 days of gear and still have an awful lot of freeboard , manoeverability and speed . In retrospect , I would give the design a 10 out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the quality and implementation of Swift 's layup and trim . They need to get someone with better composite layup skills to oversee the construction and stop using things like graphite ribs . I give this portion of the canoe only a 5 out of 10.

I have found no comprehensive description of this run on I-net , though a few people on Canadian Canoe Routes responded to my request in 2010 and provided me with some invaluable information . Thus , I decide the more detailed route description will save time and efforts for people who will follow us . LONG ... Access : This river is rarely run , and most folks who did it in the past started from Matagami , Bell river bridge . To avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected to use car shuttle to north shore of Soscumica lake . The access gravel road starts from km 130 James Bay Road ( from Matagami ) Raymond Blackned ( cree Indian chief from Waskaganish ) knows the fork . The road does not come directly to the lake . After about 35 km ride , one needs to make a left turn to smaller gravel road ( 50 yards before the cabin on the road left ) . In about a mile the drivable road comes to an end . This is a marked spot , as another , less-than-drivable old road comes to the same place One needs to walk another 1/3 mile on foot following the remains of the road ( in same direction as the drive was - towards the south ) , and then make a left turn into the bush . The lake is visible on the left . It is actually visible on both sides of the cape , and you should be positioned near the center ( equal distance to both shores ) when you step into the bush . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the easier route to the lake by first holding to the left ( almost towards left bay ) and then to the right ( instead of going up the small hill ) ... following the gully at the hill 's foot , we reached the lake 's shore at the right side of the bay . There is a nice beach there , a perfect place to start the trip . <p> Our maps were marked with distances from the point in river mouth where Indians were going to pick us with motorboats . These km marks are not consistent with anything else , but I will use them anyway . You can either calibrate your own maps or contact me to get a copy of our maps . <p> Our track starts at ( approx. ) km 191 on our maps . <p> Impression : The river is huge , wide and dangerous . . Especially with very high water level we had ( no gauge to reliably measure it , but cree people told us that very high and muddy water was not common for mid- July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably 3 to 5 times more water , and Broadback is a large river itself . Even though there are more class 5 and 6 ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 ) rapids on Nottaway , number of runnable big rapids is actually fewer , especially , if taken relative to route length ( Broadback from the bridge to James bay is approx. 130 km +- 10 km ) . Nottaway seems more remote and wild ( though we had seen two small houses - hunter 's camps ) . Portages are longer and more difficult . Scenery is comparable - good , but not superb , I 'd give a nod to Broadback in this category , if not for " moonlike " landscapes with flat rocks on Nottaway on the last river day . Broadback counters with the spectacular 30-meter-high falls . <p> On a plus side , Nottaway has plenty of campsites - a nice difference to Broadback . All-in-all , these two rivers are comparable : both are difficult big-water runs . If you intend to try only one of them , Broadback is likely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less danger with similar difficulty level . In my opinion , it is not a good idea to run either of these 2 rivers in open canoe - unless you are able to roll a loaded canoe in white water ( and I knew very few such people ) . The reason is simple : you must rely on self-rescue on these rivers - otherwise you will have to either line/portage most of the rapids ( hard , hard work ) , even these that are relatively easy to run - or , alternatively , run them ... but at unacceptable level of risk . All inflatable boats allow you good self-rescue options ( though you must have sufficient skills - not to loose a paddle and not get separated from the boat when it flips ) , and this is a huge difference . You pay for the safety and fun in rapids with slower speed and difficulties with headwinds , but it is worth it . --- There are about 12 rapids of class 4 and 5 in 180 km below Soscumica lake . A few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interdite ) are among the largest I ever saw ; they are unrunnable , do n't have sneak routes in side channels and likely will kill anyone who 's accidentally swept into them . I had run many class 5 rapids in hard shell kayak , but these are well above my threshold for " acceptable risk " . Another rapid we did not run is probably class 5.1 and still very dangerous - at least , for the boats . 8 others ( this number also depends on how you count rapids in some cascades ) we had run - at least , partially , sometimes only by Raftmaster , sometimes with a short carry/line around a ledge or huge hole , sometimes - using side channels . 4 or 5 remaining rapids , however , we had run in main current , and river power there was apparent . There are also many rapids and stretches of class 2 and 3 water that is simply fun . Even runnable rapids on Nottaway often have current that exceeds 30 km/h . With river width of 200 meters to 1-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong side of the river , you may have to line or paddle upstream quite a significant distance before it is safe to attempt a ferry . We made this mistake twice , and both times paid with couple of hours of hard work . Central channels in all big rapids have huge standing waves , 2.5 - 3 meters high and large hydraulics . Interdite rapid has the single largest wave I 've ever seen , it is approximately 5-6 meters high and has a slope of about 20-25 meters . Normally such waves do not exist , as waves break when they reach 3 m . But at this spot , a combination of high current speed and funnel effect ( there is huge side wave on the river left that acts as a support pillar for the monster wave in the center ) create this curious monster feature ... <p> Runnable big rapids on Nottaway present you with a few unusual problems . For example , the river is too wide to set up a rescue from the shore or from eddy if someone runs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves became more of an issue ... Similarly , there are a few places there good lines are out of question simply because previous rapid had the good lines close to opposite shore , and there is not enough time for a ferry . Finally , it is very hard to correctly estimate size of waves and holes when river is a few hundred meters wide . Sometimes what looks small from the shore ( and on photos ) , in reality , is quite big . All of the sudden , wave starts to break high above your head and it 's back slope is twice as long as your boat . For an observer on the shore it looks like optical illusion : a huge raft starts to disappear between waves that look like nothing at all ... On a plus side , most of these waves are scary but smooth and easy , they do little damage , besides disorienting the boaters . In some instances though , these waves can stop and backsurf the raft or flip the hardshell kayak ( and tamper with subsequent roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the wave trains are big enough to swallow the canoe . In other words , big water is what it is - difficult big water . <p> The route includes a few lakes , and we had a bad luck with a very strong headwind on couple of these lakes . Even with current 's help ( the river is so big that all the lakes have noticeable flow ) we could not fight this wind and had to line along the shore - a difficult task , as banks are often a mixture of sand and mud and not solid . As a result , we did not make it in 6 days as originally planned . We went out of last rapid into the tidal zone only a few hours late - but this resulted in a whole extra day because of tide schedule . For someone who follows this description and does not repeat our mistakes with choosing wrong shore on approach , 6 full days is a reasonable time to make it ( 7-8 days from Matagami ) . One layover day is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore just above the Interdite island . You can carry the empty boats along a dry channel on your rest day ( 1.5 km carry ) - and follow the next day with gear bags . <p> Our water lever was high ( or medium - high ) for July ; the water was brown - no fish . With lower water level a few rapids may become easier , but other few will retain all their power and danger . <p> Last note to readers : when you look at the pictures in our photo albums , please adjust what you see for the river size . It 's usually 200-400 meters wide , and with very tall trees on the shore you loose the " scale " ... Rapids on pictures seem way smaller than they actually are . <p> Technical details : First easy rapids appear at km 178 an 176 after approx. 11 km paddle on lake Soscumica , which may take 2-4 hours depending on your luck with the wind . At some point on the lake , you make a 45 degree turn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter from wind through the narrow ( 1-2 meter wide ) stripe of land that connects north shore with a cape at turning point . There is a decent campsite there . Rapids at km 178 and 176 are class 1 and 2 respectively . <p> Occasional small rapids and wide river bed will continue to km 152 ( half-day paddle ) . There you 'll see a first big rapid , class 4/ 4+ . Approach and scout from the right . Left side is a series of rocks and ledges with hard holes and tricky class 5 lines and class 4 sneak lines along the shore . The right side of the river is clear , main obstacle are irregular standing waves ( center and right side of channel ) and big hydraulics left of main current . This best line is to ferry 2/3 of the channel from right to left side , then angle boat to the left and paddle away from standing waves , but avoid catching hydraulics between main current and left eddies . <p> There is a nice small island campsite ( flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rapid Long at km 125 . Class 3 / 3+ . Easy scout and run from the right side . To avoid the wave train , start in the middle and then angle towards right shore . Run on the extreme right is not advisable , because of some mid-size holes and side waves there . km 119 is spectacular Iroquez Falls . One of 3 deadly class 6 ( 5.3 ) rapids on the route . Approach and portage trail is on the left . Portage trail ( 400- 500 m ) is not easy to find , but it is there . Iroquez dumps water into lake Dusaux . The first part of the lake is 12 km long and up to 2 km wide - and still flows ... but if you get a strong headwind there , it may stop you dead on tracks .. Lining along the shore is possible , but difficult . There is an easy R1/ R2 rapid that separates second part of the lake Dusaux from the first one .

The coming rapid is one of 3 monsters that certainly require portage . It is called Kachechekuch , but I 've learned its name later . It is marked on the topo map but not named there unlike all previous big rapids , so we did not expect anything out of ordinary and called it " Insignificant Other " . But our humor backfired . It looked from the water that main channel may be runnable while right one had clear and unpleasant horizon line ; scouting was only possible on river left ... so we stayed on the left . That was a mistake . Scouting from the left revealed huge unrunnable class 6 ( 5.3 ) rapid and flat rock on the shore soon became a vertical rock making lining impossible ; portaging in super-dense woods is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line our boats 1 km back and then make a ferry . You can take out before the small island on the right , 100 meters above the right channel rapid which starts with immediate big drop . And if you have a nerve , you can follow our move : take out at the eddy below the island , a few meters above the rapid . The move is scary , it is actually class 2+ rapid , and you need to punch through serious eddy line with standing wave . Any mistake there may have serious consequences . But this move saves you 100 meters of hard and dangerous boulder-hopping at dry river channel , and with inflatable boats it is justified . Portage is shorter than one around Iroquez , maybe 250-300 meters , but much harder . The last section of the rapid is class 3 and can easily be run . The put-in spot is quite obvious : the vertical rock blocks the further portage , so you have to put in or negotiate a class 5 portage section through the cliff . Emergency campsite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rapid . Following rapids ( km 90 - km 86 ) are class 2 - 2+ and can all be scouted from water , then comes a small lake ( km 85-81 ) , and then the big rapid just before the Interdite .

Center of the rapid is class 5.1 ; right side is separated into 2 rapids by a huge pool , before the pool it is class 4+ and below - class 5.2 Thus , it is easier ( and shorter ) to approach on the left . Wide side channel there offer good technical run of class 3 - 4- . It is better to actually stay closer to the right side of the side channel to avoid rocks ; after side channel joins the main current , you 'll have to turn the boat more than 90 degrees and head towards left shore - to avoid huge standing waves in the main channel . Below the rapid you 'll see a superb campsite on the left , about 200 meters above dry channel which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I ever do this river again , I 'll plan for a layover day there . Interdite rapid is described above ... but you have to see it to understand what it actually is . With a high water level the " dry " channel on the left is likely to be the best option . We managed to paddle and drag the half-loaded boats there to cut the portage by half . Not that dragging was easy , but still preferable to carrying the stuff through huge and unstable rocks , some of them car-sized . Approximately half-way through the flat rocks on the right side begin , and the carry ( after some route-finding ) is easy , except last 100 meters . But in medium and low water level , the side channel can be really be dry and not possible . Also in rainy weather , with slippery rocks , portage there would be very hard and dangerous . In both these cases , it may be easier to carry through the island itself . The portage there is shorter ( for low water level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the trees . It took us nearly 4 hours to complete the portage - partially because of the raft . But even with canoes , 2-3 hours seems to me a fast time . Below the Interdite , just 3 km downstream , at km 74 , you come to the next serious obstacle ... This is a class 5.1 rapid , approach is on the right . ( We chose the wrong side again here ) . The rapid would be runnable if not for wide ledges near the bottom of the rapid . It seems from both sides , that you can not avoid at least some big holes . Left side is likely a bit more reasonable if someone wants to take the risk ; maybe in low water level some lines will become of class 5.0 or even 4+ . But in high water I really did not see any reasonable lines , and lining/carrying on the left was extremely hard ( though not totally impossible ) . The right shore meanwhile offers an easy line- and-carry of only 150 meters into the side slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the holes . There is also an emergency ( C ) campsite on the right - at the start of the portage . <p> Next serious rapid is at km 69 . Approach on the left . Main rapid seems to be class 5 or 5+ run with huge waves . On the left you can first run a rocky class 3 along the shore , then ( where river makes the right turn ) , make a sharp left turn into side channel . The channel had enough water to produce a good technical run of class 3+ or 4- . With lower water level it may be close to nothing : drag-and-drop style run or even line . <p> Next few kilometers you have a fun ride : long and easy R2 / R2+ to km 64 , then a mini-lake , and then another set of rapids ... it is easy at first , but after 2 km it builds up strength . Current forces you stay on river right ... and then it comes : a sudden horizon line . ( km 57 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not easy to see , even from 200 meters the run ahead looks smooth ) , you still have an option of hard ferry to the left - and then a class 5 wave train , scary , but probably runnable . However , safety concerns will likely make you keep close to the shore , and then it is too late for a ferry , and you have to use a micro-eddy on your right not to go over the horizon line blindly . It appears a 2-meter ( over 5-7 meter distance ) ledge . It is not a good idea to go straight over ledge because of the bad , bad keeper hole below it . The hole does not look huge , but it pulls the water back from as far as 5 or 6 meters downstream of its edge , which indicates it is very deep . There is no possible exit on either side ... DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RUN IT ! ( in high water . ) The only option there is to line next to the shore . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of our ( empty ) cats while we lined it . It took a combined efforts of two man to pull it back . <p> Easy class 1 rapid will bring you to the lake ... but it is not a lake . Despite 2 km width , it still has a 4 km/h current ... In just 3 hours you can cover a distance of 20 km ( 56 - 36 ) ... At the end of the lake the river splits at 3 major channels , they are nearly 4 1/2 km wide all together . The best rout is through leftmost channel . Keep to the left when you near the lake 's end . Small rapids will follow , and then you 'll see a big tributary on the left . There are many campsites there ... Less than 2 km below the tributary ( 34 ) , more serious rapids start . First comes a class 3 rapid - straight and scoutable from water , then there is a small island , a convenient place to scout your further lines - you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small channel in the middle of the island ( a 0.5 meter drop ) if there is enough water with subsequent class 3+ run . Then the river makes a right turn , huge flat rocks appear on left shore ; class 5- rapid starts at the bend . Park your boats at a huge pool near the left shore and scout the rapid . It has a neck breaking wave/hole near the left shore - and another huge hole in the middle . It is easy to avoid the first one , but not so easy with the second , because current will carry you strongly towards the left . The correct line in this rapid starts with paddling upstream in the left side pool , then a ferry 5/6 of the river to river right . The line goes along the edge of the wave that guards right side eddy below the initial drop . Then current starts to carry you to the left , and you have to counter by pointing directly to the right and paddling as hard as you can . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following rapid is solid class 4 , it is separated from previous one by a 400 meters of fast moving turbulent water with occasional waves - enough time to make it either to the right shore or to the left , full ferry is also possible ( because there is only class 4 , not a deadly falls below ) but hard . Next rapid is best run starting from the middle and going more and more to the right - to avoid huge waves . However , at the bottom of the rapid ( river starts to make a 90 degree turn to the left there ) you should try to make a ferry back to the left . Because next rapid ( km 32 ) that starts at the turn is runnable in full only along left side ( class 4+ ) . Run in the middle ( class 5 ) may be possible , but hard to scout ( at least from the right shore where all but one hardshell ended up ) . The run along right shore is generally class 3+ or 4- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrunnable ledge that require lining/portaging for about 70 meters around a big rock and/or using very small side channel . This is actually the last hard rapid on the river . Next comes the lake and then 4 more rapids ; they appear after all river channels join back together . First two are class 2 ( km 23 ) , then class 3 ( km 20 ) and 3+ ( km 18 ) , all scoutable from water . Our worries about km 20 rapid , where river narrows to 300 meters was baseless . These last rapids seem to be gravel-bottom type , so there are just waves ( sometimes - big breaking waves ) , but no holes . In other words , you have a fun ride at the end . As you enter the bay after the last rapid , you have to think about the tides , that may be very high there cree Indians advised us that if there is a head wind , we should follow the left shore , using a channel behind 3 small islands , about 10 km from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 2-d and 3-d island - and from there cross over directly to opposite side ... You will find a nice campsite there , and a small brook with clear water . This is a place where Indians can come and pick you up .

The topo maps do n't  really give enough detail to get through the delta . 134054 @qwx994054 <p> As the French River finishes winding its twisting route from Lake Nipissing to Georgian Bay , the final section runs between sculpted rock walls and shorelines of sparse pine and stunted spruce . At a point called " The Junction " ( just north of the delta ) , the river splits into four main paths which in turn divide into smaller channels , tumbling over small rapids as they flow southward . These narrow channels follow fault lines between glacier-scoured islands . Ultimately , eight separate channels flow out into Georgian Bay , offering a spectacular opportunity for exploration by canoe . On two trips , one in September of 1992 and another in August of 1997 , we paddled down to the delta to follow these narrow , rocky channels into Georgian Bay . Both routes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marina . The marina is at the end of the Bigwood Road on the west side of Highway 69 , a journey of approximately 13 km from the highway . Paid parking and launching facilities are available there . The route goes west through Hartley Bay , then south through Wanapitei Bay to the intersection of the Main Channel and the Western Channel . At this " crossroads " the route heads due west along the Western Channel and eventually south towards Georgian Bay . It is advisable to get an early start from Hartley Bay , since the prevailing southwesterly winds off Georgian Bay can cause strong headwinds . <p> September 1992 <p> Our 1992 trip saw us leaving Hartley Bay Marina in the hardest downpour I have ever paddled in . The rain bouncing off Hartley Bay made the water surface turn white , as if we were paddling through a snowfield . We were forced to stop several times to bail the canoes before we reached Wanapitei Bay . A sudden violent thunderstorm sent us scurrying for shore , and we sat dripping in our rain suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain finally let up and we continued south on Wanapitei Bay into a strong headwind . We fought our way south stroke by stroke , not daring to stop lest we blow backwards and lose our hard-won progress . Hopping from island to island and resting in the lee sides , we finally made it to the Western Channel . I will forever have fond memories of the owners of Atwood Island Lodge , who welcomed in six bedraggled looking paddlers for coffee and muffins , even though they were in the process of closing the lodge for the year . <p> Rejuvenated by the hot coffee , we continued west for another five kilometres to Crombie Bay Point . A combination of our waterlogged state and the high quality of the campsite prompted us to stop for the night . We quickly put up our rain tarp and set about cooking our traditional first-night steak dinner . Mother nature obviously knew that our patience was wearing thin , since she blew aside the clouds after supper and we were treated to a spectacular sunset and a dazzling display of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm temperatures on day two , and began the short paddle to the delta . We had chosen to take the simplest route through the area which leads through Lily Chute . After a few sections of swift water , we were down at the chute . With the high water conditions and the relative inexperience of some of our paddlers , we decided that the chute was not runnable . We walked the canoes down a narrow channel in the island to the west of the chute , then portaged the short distance ( Farley Portage ) to put us below the rapid . <p> We paddled over to inspect our " exit " from this area - the Devils Door . It was a 6 ft. drop with an ugly-looking hydraulic at the base , so we paused to examine any other alternatives . There was supposed to be a short but rough portage which ran parallel to Devils Door on the north side , but it seemed to be more mountain-climbing than portaging . Our only other option was to paddle south through the Jamieson Rapids to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of Devils Door . The Little Jamiesons were nothing more than a bouncing downhill ride through some waves , so we ran them . A short 1.5 km paddle south , around the point and back up again put us at the far side of the Devils Door close to the mouth of the East Cross Channel . <p> East Cross Channel begins as a fairly wide body of water which is often used as a powerboat anchorage , but quickly narrows down to a shallow , weedy creek . A few pullovers and some wading were required to negotiate the last section . My cousin had paddled this section before , and always referred to it as " Root Beer Creek " . The reason became quickly apparent - the water , stained by organic content , was a deep brown colour . <p> The channel empties into Georgian Bay behind a maze of small islands . Our plan was to gain some shelter from the rollers on the bay by skirting behind these islands , then head north up the Main Channel of the French . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting bays to locate the entrance into the Main Channel . Unfortunately our navigation skills were lacking that day , and as we headed out across the final bay towards the point , we realized that we were " one bay too far " and were heading out into a 1.5 km crossing of a large bay towards Cantin Point , pushed along by strong winds and 3 ft. swells . The rough conditions made it impossible to turn around , so fighting to stay quartered to the following waves , and taking on water over the stern , we bounced along until we arrived at the point . <p> A change of plans was obviously in order . With the strong westerly winds , we were not going to be able to backtrack west to the Main Channel , so we decided to alter our route and paddle the more easterly through Bass Lake , after which we would return via the Eastern Outlet of the French . We pulled the gear ashore and ate a hearty supper as we waited for the winds to die . The strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our wet clothes , and soon a line was rigged with pants and shirts flying horizontally like windsocks . By 7:00 pm the water looked much more manageable , so we paddled over to Obstacle Island , just south of the Eastern Outlet . The campsite on the island was not ideal , but in the early darkness of mid-September we were already going to be setting up camp by lantern-light , so it seemed prudent to stay put . Day three involved an easy 240 m portage over the " boardwalk " into Bass Lake . The wood structure , which was built to provide easy passage between the bay and Bass Lake passes an Rainbow Lodge , and abandoned fishing camp . An hours paddling took us north through the Eastern Outlet to the Elbow , where we retraced our route back to Hartley Bay Marina . <p> August 1997 <p> A sunny , 25 C day with light winds was a welcome change from our previous introduction to Hartley and Wanapitei Bays . Our group covered in three easy hours what had been a gruelling five-hour paddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our rapid progress meant that it was only lunchtime , so we decided to have a quick meal and continue south towards the delta . Of course , after lunch the winds began to pick up and we found ourselves paddling into a brisk headwind . <p> We began checking campsites as we headed down the river . There were only two sites between our location and the delta . The first had a sand beach and a weedy waterfront ; and the tent area was small and uneven . We paddled on to the next area , a sandy beach just downstream of a cottage . Camping on a beach sites is n't our favourite since the sand always seems to find its way into food , equipment and sleeping bags , but the steadily increasing wind and threatening whitecaps convinced us to stay . We spent a glorious afternoon relaxing in the afternoon sunshine at the shoreline , cooled by the winds from Georgian Bay . <p> Although we were up at 6:30 am , the time required to admire the sunrise and drink countless pots of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on the water . A short paddle brought us to the Junction . We had decided to paddle through the delta in the Old Voyageurs Channel . After much discussion and map study we entered what we hoped was the correct outlet . Original topo maps for the delta area showed the Voyageur Channel as the most westerly outlet of the French . Eric Morse , in his book " Freshwater Saga " tells how he felt this was in error , since that channel was not navigable under certain water conditions , and did not match the descriptions of the channel from early journals . The correct channel - the one used by the Voyageurs - is now marked on the maps as " Old Voyageurs Channel " . As we paddled into the narrow outlet , we began to recognize landmarks . We paddled through the Rock Garden , Palmer Rocks , Petite Faucille and la Dalle ( the trough ) . Water levels were very low on this trip , so none of the rapids were actually rapids - they were simply winding paths through rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small ledge at a corner in the channel . We lined the loaded canoes down that drop . <p> Both the incredible beauty of this section and the historical significance of the area gave us pause to reflect as we paddled . It was not difficult to imagine the voyageurs as they worked their birch bark canoes down through these narrow channels . <p> We paddled west through the Cross Channels and as we passed between the base of Lily Chutes and the head of the Jamiesons , we noticed that the low water levels had made them almost flatwater . We paddled straight through Devils Door , which had simply disappeared in the low water conditions . We had expected our voyage through East Cross Channel to be a little more strenuous because of the dry conditions , and this was indeed the case . There were many short liftovers and muddy sections to wade through as we made our way along the channel . We finally emerged from the creek and stopped for lunch on the small islands clustered around the outlet into Georgian Bay . <p> Georgian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with small rollers and a moderate west wind . We paddled along the rugged coastline , then headed north towards the main channel of the French . We were hoping to stay at the site on Sabine Island , but it was occupied by a group of young paddlers from Philadelphia , so we paddled across to Bluff Point . The campsite there has a rather small tent area , but it was the closest stop for us . We spent the afternoon lounging in the warm sun and watched a magnificent sunset that evening . <p> Day three brought with it the threat of rain and a very strong wind from the southwest . We did not complain about this wind , since it would be at our backs as we paddled north up the Main Channel . We tied the canoes together , hoisted a tarp as a spinnaker and literally flew up the river . As we lay back and watched the scenery go past , we saw the small lighthouse and concrete foundations which mark the location of French River Village , a lumbering community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east towards Dalles Rapids , so we lowered our makeshift sail and paddled towards the rapid . It was very low , with only a narrow centre channel flowing down towards us . We lined the canoes up the fast water , holding our breath to avoid the odour of a moose carcass which lay rotting on the rocks beside the channel . <p> A short paddle east brought us to Wanapitei Bay . We once again hoisted the sail and relaxed as the wind blew us up to the entrance to Hartley Bay , our take-out for the trip . <p> Richard Munn September 1997 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @qwx994055 <p> JUNE 22-26 2002 We just paddled ( a variant ) of this trip at very high water levels . We started at the village of French River ( right on Highway 69 and the French River , canoe rental at French River Supply Post ) and went through to the river delta at Georgian Bay . It was a fantastic trip with very enjoyable Group of 7 scenery ( as is described above and in many other sources ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels we encountered caused some of the swifts and currents to become impassable , and some others to appear where none were indicated on our map ( the standard red map from Ontario Parks ) nor mentioned in our book - or worse ( Further up the Creek by Kevin Callan/Stodart Publishing ISBN 1-55046-275-X ) . <p> Since we started out at French River ( and not at Hartley Bay ) we had to go past Recollet Falls . These were definitely impassable ( I guess that would be true at most water levels ) and you should take the portage ( boardwalk ) to the left ( south ) . I suggest not waiting for the boardwalk to get out , but get out some 10m before that , as there are some currents right at the boardwalk and in no case do you want to miss the boardwalk . The portage is short and easy . However , leaving the portage can be very imposing . We had to steer the canoe to the center of the river into the strong currents of the falls in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falls were very strong and put us right back at the foot of the portage during our first attempt . <p> The rapids downstream from Flowerpot Bay ( I believe they are referred to as the flat rapids ) could probably be run by experienced white water canoeists but for the rest of us the portage to the left ( south ) is highly recommended at these water levels . I believe that normally these rapids are run regularly by boats . <p> From here it was straight forward to our first camping spot just across from Crombie Bay . <p> The following day we went through the Old Voyageur Channel onto Georgian Bay . The map shows no rapids on this channel , and our book had some very deceptive descriptions of the currents . <p> The first rapids we encountered were just north of Morse Bay ( which apparently is the big water on the south/east of the Old Voyageur Channel , not named on the map ) . These were not described in our book nor are they indicated on the map . They were easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore just before them to check them out as there are many possible routes ( and they definitely were rapids ) . Alternatively , you could portage over an island somewhat to the left in the Channel , thereby bypassing the rapids altogether . <p> The next rapids were right after Morse Bay ( Petite Faucill , again not on the map but in our book ) . They were really short , but in a curve and powerful . They could probably be run , but there is a really short , easy portage just to the left ( south ) of them . <p> The Palmer Rapids ( not on the map , but in our book ) came up quickly after , but did not amount to much . As a matter of fact , I do not remember much of them . <p> After Palmer Rapids the La Dalle swifts appear . They were described in our book as no problem at any water level . This is wrong . It is true that apparently for most of the year it does not amount to much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the womans washing machine check them out at these water levels and you will know why and people have drowned here . Some brave people might want to attempt them , but anyone should first climb on shore and check them out right until the end ( the start does not look that menacing ) . For most of us , there is some sort of a portage to the left of the swifts . The entrance of this portage is relatively easy to find , following the portage itself is harder but it does exist . After the portage you still need to navigate some light white water , but this was straight forward ( and fun ) . <p> Next , we turned east into the West Cross Channel ( which was upstream ) . However , the Cross Channel Rapids were impossible to do upstream , and we could not find a way through on land ( nor did we want to , since by now we were not looking forward to go through the area of the Bad River rapids and the Devils Door ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down the Fort Channel into Georgian Bay . <p> From here we stayed behind the shield of numerous small islands and rock formations to our second camping spot just west of Sand Bay . Even though Georgian Bay was somewhat rough , we were paddling on perfectly flat water all the way through to Sand Bay . Navigation through these islands/rocks is not made easier by the low water levels in Georgian Bay itself ( thereby exposing more rocks than are indicated on the map ) , but the additional rocks do create more flat water . <p> On the next day we went up through Bass Creek , the Elbow , Whales Mouth , Eastern Outlet , Ox Bay , Wanapitei Bay and spent two nights in the area ( the area is well described elsewhere , so attempting to improve on that would be arrogant ) . Water levels were not causing any significantly different circumstances here . <p> To get back to the village of French River ( on Hwy 69 ) we took the Pickerel River , as the French River itself would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pickerel was easy going . Apparently there can be some very minor rapids/swifts where the river goes slightly North/South just west of Little Canoe Channel . In our case these were hardly detectible ( we would not have noticed them if we did not know that they should be there water was actually back flowing from the French into the Pickerel ) . <p> The final obstacle to our car was passing Little French Rapids . Apparently there is something of a portage to the left ( north ) , which we could not get to ( strong currents out of the rapids ) or could simply not find . Nor could we find an alternative portage ; hence we turned back to Smith Marine/White Cross to arrange for a pick up . <p> All-in-all the trip was fantastic . What I described here are just the obstacles created by the unusually high water levels we encountered . The high water levels are not normal for this time of year .

The wooden canoe will never die - there is just too much tradition associated with the art of canoeing for this to happen . Wooden canoes will also stay with us because of aesthetics - there is no fiberglass or Royalex canoe that can match the beauty of a well-maintained wooden boat . Wood canoes fall into two main categories - strippers and wood-canvas models . <p> Strippers are constructed of long , thin cedar strips that are stapled to the outside of a form . The edges of the strips are glued together as they are installed . After the glue has dried , the staples are pulled and the hull sanded and fiberglassed on the outside . The boat is removed the form and the process is repeated on the inside . After trimming , the result is a lightweight wooden canoe with no ribs - just a smooth surface of clear fiberglass with the glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive to purchase , they can be hand-built by anyone with reasonable carpentry skills and a bit of patience for a reasonable cost . <p> Stripper Canoe - Photo Credit : J Joven <p> Cedar-canvas canoes are made with a different construction technique . Ribs are bent to shape and fastened over a form . Cedar planks are fastened to these ribs with copper nails , then the hull is covered with canvas and painted . This is the traditional canoe - the one that many of us learned to paddle in . There are many of these canoes still in active service after generations of use - they are much tougher than many of us imagine . Watch Bill Mason 's " Path of the Paddle " videos and watch how he calmly bumps a cedar-canvas prospector through Class III rapids . <p> Langford Cedar-Canvas Canoe <h> Aluminum <p> Aluminum Canoes are constructed by placing sheets of aluminum into a large press where they are squeezed between two molds into the shape of half of a canoe . The canoe halves are tempered and riveted together , then trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe industry was spawned by the end of World War II , when the Grumman Company realized it needed business to replace the dwindling need for aluminum aircraft bodies . <p> Marathon Aluminum Canoe <p> At the time they were first manufactured , they were a revolutionary innovation . They were sturdy , corrosion-proof and they were the boat that made whitewater paddling safer and more accessible to a wide range of paddlers . All outfitters and the vast majority of serious wilderness trippers used to paddle in aluminum canoes . <p> The advantage of aluminum canoes ? They are the only canoe that can be thrown out back of the wood shed for the winter and completely and utterly ignored . They do not have to be protected from sunlight , and they last pretty much forever . <p> Disadvantages ? They are noisy - waves slap against the hull , and a knock from a paddle will send a booming echo across the lake . They also heat up quickly in the sun , cool off quickly in the cold ; and unless the bottom is painted flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most serious disadvantage , however is the tendency of aluminum to stick on any rocks they encounter . Aluminum is a soft metal , and a bump against a submerged rock usually means that you will be rocking the canoe back and forth to free it . <h> Fiberglass <p> The most common type of canoe in use today , fiberglass boats are constructed by laying sheets and strips of fiberglass cloth into a mold and saturating the fabric with resin . This is a very simplified explanation of the construction process - there are a multitude of fabrics , resins and processes that may be used to " fine-tune " this way of building canoes . <p> Quality of fiberglass boats ranges from excellent to horrific . Some of the best wilderness tripping canoes are constructed from fiberglass layups . Unfortunately , the cheapest , ugliest and heaviest canoes are also constructed from the same material . It 's certainly worth doing some research and trying out a boat before you buy it .. Unless you are travelling in the far north on extended wilderness trips ; or intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good quality fiberglass canoe will probably be a good choice for you . <p> It is worth noting that some fiberglass boats are made using " chopper gun " techniques , where shredded fiberglass is sprayed from the nozzle of a gun and saturated with resin . In general , these boats are heavy and weaker than cloth layups , and should be avoided . <h> Kevlar <p> Kevlar canoes are manufactured exactly the same way as fiberglass canoes . The only difference is the fabric used . Kevlar 49 is a fabric manufactured by Dupont which has a much higher tensile strength than fiberglass fabric . <p> Does this mean that boats with Kevlar layups are always stronger than fiberglass layups ? Not necessarily . If we built two identical canoes - one with fiberglass and one with Kevlar , the Kevlar boat would definitely be stronger . What is often done though , is to put less material into Kevlar canoes , since the material is stronger . Because there is less material , the boat is nice and light . For the same reason ( less material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a good fiberglass canoe . Kevlar is tough , but do n't be fooled into thinking that it 's indestructible . Kevlar boats will " wrap and snap " just as easily as a fiberglass canoe , and are more difficult to repair . Who should buy a Kevlar Canoe ? A paddler who does mostly flatwater trips linked by lots of or long portages . If light weight is your primary consideration , this is the material for you . <h> ABS <p> Canoes used to be made from pure ABS , but the result was not good . ABS canoes were heavy and not very strong , and designs were not great . <p> Modern ABS boats are constructed from laminates - a foam core with tough , slippery plastic skins inside and out . The most common brand of this material is Royalex , manufactured by Uniroyal . The material is fabricated in sheets and is thermoformed on molds . <p> This type of canoe is about as close to bulletproof as any canoe will get . It is almost impossible to put a hole through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it pops back into shape even after being crushed and folded into impossibly contorted configurations . Royalex canoes have established themselves as the canoe material of choice for paddlers who need absolute reliability or who paddle serious whitewater on a regular basis . <p> Royalite is a thinner , lighter version of Royalex for those who are willing to sacrifice some durability and toughness for a lighter boat . <h> Polyethylene <p> Polyethylene is tough , but not particularly rigid . <p> There are a couple of ways of solving this problem . <p> Coleman 's solution is to brace the interior of the canoe with aluminum tubes and struts , which makes of an " ok " canoe for the cottage , but one which is too heavy and clunky for wilderness tripping . <p> Old Town Canoe Company makes a lay-up with an expanded polyethylene core and polyethylene skins , and the result has been quite successful for them . <p> A number of other manufacturers ( for example , Langford Canoe and Paluski Boats ) have adopted this type material for their plastic boats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The material , commonly known as " triple dump plastic " is made into canoes using a rotomold process . Polyethylene is injected into a hull mold , which is turned and rotated to leave a thin skin after curing . A second dump of polyethylene ( this time with a foaming agent ) is dumped into the same mold , which adds a foam core bonded to the initial skin . A final layer is added in a third dump which puts the skin on the other side of the foam core .

Both rivers are traveled downsteam with two short hight of land areas that include creeks and moderate length portages . The two rivers are completely different in character . The Brokenmouth is a small river with many short rapids and senic shutes that require a combination of lining , liftovers , wading and draging ( in low water ) , and some trecherous portages . Most of the portages are nonexistent and are simply a carry down the side of the river over boulder strewn over flow channels . I consider myself extremely sure footed but still found myself going for numous tumbles as I carried packs and canoes down these trecherous rocks . This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry . Although the portages are short most of them are either nonexistent or overgrown . All this said the Brokenmouth is a fabuluous rocky little river and in the spring has lots of highly technical rapids . In low water this translates into countless short grinding crucnching rocky rapids . Do n't even think of taking a kevlar or non ABS canoe on this river , it wo n't survive the trip unless you take two weeks for the brokenmouth alone . Although I do n't know how the Brokenmouth got its name it is very aptly named . It could also be named brokenleg , bruised shin , or battered body : ) All this said it is a beautiful little River with only a few tourist camps and fantastic fishing . Below one falls I caught 20+ Walleye while I waited for the rest of the group to finishing the 75 metre portage . Campsites can be difficult to find as it is never traveled and was burned 20-30 years ago . The return on the Wenasaga river is an entirely different trip . The Wenasaga also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Wenasag is not as remote and has fly in camps on 4-5 of the lakes . It is also a much swampier area which means more bugs and lots of moose sightings . The fishing was generally not as good as the Brokenmouth . The portages however existed ( unlike the Brokenmouth ) and most were decent by NW Ontario standards . All in all a very nice trip , with excellent fishing , many beautiful lakes and rapids , lots of rocky short portages/bush crashes . Not recomended for those without lots of portaging experience and must be in excellent shape .

This trip can be made in one day if you want to rush through it . Two days gives a little time to view the scenery and three days would allow for a little fishing . We decided to take 5 days . Instead of putting in at the upper end of Raven Lake , we put in on Larder Lake . This made the total trip distance 40km . This extra 10km across Larder Lake simply extends the trip by another day . To extend the trip another day we took a campsite for two nights and had a relaxing lay-over day . <p> Since we started at Larder Lake I have no description of the Raven Lake access point . However the old MNR publication says there is a dock and parking available . Starting at Larder Lake eventually brings you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putting in at Larder Lake allows you to paddle the upper portion of Larder River and view the spectacular Raven Falls . Even if you put-in at Raven Lake , a walk up Raven Falls to take in the view is a must . <p> This trip information must be used as per the water conditions . When we made this trip the water level was quite low . Some spots that had no water on this trip would be completely under water in high water conditions . With the lower water level all of the rapids on the trip were bump and grind boulder gardens . Mostly Class I II with perhaps a Class II technical for a couple of them . In higher water conditions many of the rapids would become easier from the point of rocks but harder due to the speed and volume of water . Most of them would take on a Class II technical rating with some probably a Class III . I 'm not an expert at rating rapids so my description is only a general opinion from my limited knowledge . All rapids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . The MNR Publication for the Park states , " Some rapids can be run by experienced canoeists , but all the portages are recommended . " And on the Ontario Parks web-site it states , " NOTE , much of the river features wild white waterto be challenged by experienced canoeists only . " <p> Campsites and portages are marked quite well but there are a few where someone has torn down the markers . Why anyone would do that is beyond me especially if the portage starts well above any rapids that are not visible . Knowing river right or river left for most of the portages is a must ! Footing on the majority of portages is good when dry but hazardous when wet as the ground is mostly smooth bedrock and always on a slant , never flat ! In general the campsites we saw were sufficient size for up to 3 scattered tents with ground being a mixture of moss covered bedrock and some soil . <p> My overall assessment is that the scenery is fantastic , the river travel and rapids are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water but white water experience and scouting is necessary in higher water conditions . The campsites we saw were on the small side , level tent pads practically nonexistent on many of them , but they did accommodate our three tents and on our layover day we had 4 tents set up on a larger site . Portage and campsite signs are hit and miss . Some of us do n't  care to see any signs anyway . All the portages were easy except for slippery footing . As usual there was too much garbage lying around . But then if I see even one beer can that 's too much for my liking . Some of these small lakes especially at the North and South ends of the park are popular fishing spots , accessible by motor boat . We saw very little wildlife ; perhaps a different week or month would have made a difference . The shuttle setup can be a bit of a pain especially when it is 2.5 3 hours . Having someone drive your vehicle(s) to the take-out would be a real plus . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the opportunity I would definitely do it again . 134054 @qwx994054 <p> This trip was decided on mainly by a newbie to canoeing Dan D. He had taken this trip a couple times many years ago as a young lad with his father . I took Dan D up on this trip suggestion and invited a few more pals , Bob and Ron ( tandem ) and Dan T. ( solo ) . Myself and Dan D would also be paddling solo . Bob , Ron and Dan T being from out of town stayed at my house the night before and after Dan D met up with us for a quick coffee and breakfast snack provided by Bob , we took off on our adventure . <p> Day 1 Lots of driving ! 15k paddle . One short portage of 100m . We left North Bay around 7:30am . One hour on Hwy 11 North to Temagami we stopped for gas . We needed two vehicles minimum and three for comfort . Dan T had his canoe on his roof . Bob and Ron traveled together in Bobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his canoe on the roof and pulling my utility trailer with two canoes , mine and Bobs , along with most of the gear . Another hour to the turn off to Hwy 569 south of Englehart . Continue North on 569 until the pavement ends . The gravel road that follows is Sheppard Lake Road . This is where the TOPO Map is really a must have item . Continuing along gravel roads until we get to the take-out point on Wendigo Lake . This park access has ample parking space but does not allow for camping . There is camping allowed at the most southerly access point on Clear Lake . Leaving Bobs car as the return shuttle vehicle we backtracked 25 km to the junction of Hwys 569 and 11 where Hwy 624 joins . Hwy 624 takes you directly to Larder Lake , about an hours drive . The Larder Lake Marina is easy to locate and free parking is available . There is a store in Larder Lake to purchase last minute supplies/gear and food . There is also an LCBO ! By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was approximately 12:00noon . <p> The day was full overcast with rain showers and drizzle the whole drive north . With 15km of paddling ahead of us on Larder Lake , we took off hoping the winds would stay relatively calm as they had so far that morning . Naturally a stiff breeze kicked up before we got across the top of Larder Lake . Small whitecaps but nothing too severe . Once we rounded the corner at the narrows we were sheltered from the wind but of course means the rain increases . Ca n't expect everything to be perfect ! It was hard navigating in the fog that crept in . We wanted to stay closer to shore but knew we had to head into more open water or else it would take too long to reach our first nights destination . In less cloudy conditions the direction would have been much easier to see . Sheltered from most of the wind and Dan T. taking the lead using his GPS , we made it to the end of Larder Lake as the clouds broke and the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River brought us to the first portage of the trip . 100m carry to the Larder Lake Dam . The Dam is our first nights camp . There is an old partially submerged wooden dock to the right of the Dam . As we were unloading we noticed some very dark clouds heading our way and the thunder was getting louder . We had enough time to get most of the gear to the Dam and take out a tarp to set up . Before we could get the tarp up , the skies opened up and it POURED . We were completely drenched in a matter of seconds , so we just kept on putting up the tarp . <p> The rain stopped as quickly as it had come . We finished setting up camp . The site is large but with uneven ground . We had three tents and decided only two could be set up comfortably along with the tarp leaving enough room for the fire . Dan D and I set up our tent back on the portage trail where it was obvious other tents had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first night . I helped him cook up Bar-B-Q steak , potatoes and vegetables . And of course copious amounts of beer since we did n't  have to portage any of it to this point ! It took a while to get a good fire going and while gathering firewood I slipped and fell . Lots of blood from my skinned left elbow which could have been broken if I had fallen directly on it . The worst of the fall was that I twisted my lower back which would plague me for the rest of the trip . Thank goodness for drugs ! The rain held off the rest of the night only sprinkling now and again , just enough to keep everything soaking wet . <p> Day 2 8km total , 9 portages/rapids . Mainly cloudy with a hint of blue showing through now and again looked very promising . I was the first one up and explored the Dam area for a while . Dan D was responsible for breakfast and we had a good feed of bacon and eggs , coffee and bagels . With our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and food gone , we packed up ready to hit the river . Of course the soggy equipment and packs made up for any lost weight ! Since there was a small lift-over just 30-40m downstream we carried our gear to that point . After this there were 3 more sets of short rapids/swifts separated by small pools . For each of these boulder sections , and what became the norm for the rest of the trip , we stayed in the canoe until we had to get out and walk the canoe over the rocks . Bob and Ron had the roughest time being tandem they sat much lower in the water than the rest of us . Plus they had a fiberglass canoe whereas the solo boats were plastic . They had to be a bit more careful . <p> As we approached Raven Falls a couple km downstream , Dan D said to get our cameras ready . He was n't kidding ! The view from the top of Raven Falls is spectacular . Raven Lake is in the distance and you cant see all of the falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is smooth rock Dan D simply left his gear in his canoe and slid it down the rock ! ( What the heck , he had a Coleman ) I could have done the same but .. This sort of set pace for the rest of the trip as far as rapids goes . Dan D had no problem attempting any of the rapids since his 15 Coleman was not a big concern of his . I followed close behind Dan D on most of the rapids but there were a couple I did n't  take that he did . <p> At Raven Lake we stopped for a bit of lunch . This is only 2.5km since we started this morning . We werent really pushing it , but at the same time we realized how much portaging was involved and we were not going to make it to our next campsite in any record time . ( should have slid the canoe down the rocks ! ) By now the sun was coming out , no more rain . <p> Paddle down Raven Lake to the small water dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an old power station we explored for a few minutes . Dan D went down the river , the rest of us portaged ! Another short portage brought us into Ward Lake . After another short portage and paddling towards the bottom end of Ward Lake we had a bit of a problem finding the next portage . Into a small bay at the south/east corner of Ward Lake it shows another set of rapids with portage of 150m . I knew we were in the right spot but could not see any portage sign or any visible trail before the first little swift on this set of rapids . Bob and Ron figured we were in the wrong spot and they backtracked to the main body of the lake to explore further down . Dan D and I said let 's go for it and headed down the small swift . Dan T stayed behind to see what we found . As soon as we popped out at the end of the swift we could see the portage sign straight ahead of us . <p> Dan D naturally headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to take this one , looked a bit too much for me . Dan T came through the swift and we headed down the portage . The campsite supposedly in the middle of this portage according to the map is non existent although the ground is flat enough to pitch a tent just about anywhere in this area . Time was starting to run out and we decided on a campsite at the far end of the portage . Dan T and I continued portaging our gear and eventually Bob and Ron showed up at the start of the portage since there was no other path where they had explored and it was obvious they had to follow where we had left them . So the entire 2nd day was only 8km total but we had taken close to 8 hours to get there . Talk about lily-dipping ! <p> We set up camp , hung a tarp again even though the skies look promising for no rain . It was Bob &amp; Rons turn to make supper and we feasted on a delicious beef curry with rice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Day 3 7km total , 5 portages/rapids . Breakfast compliments of Bob &amp; Ron . Western omelets , bagels , juice and coffee . Just a few minutes paddle to the end of this small lake Dan D and I ran the short rapids , again bumping our way down a boulder garden while the rest of the group portaged . A few minutes later the map said " swirling current " . It ended up being a shallow rapid but this time no large boulders . Easily taken in higher water and on this trip by the solo boats but Bob and Ron eventually had to get out and walk their canoe a short distance . <p> Another couple small rapids and nice scenery brought us to a section of unnamed lake just above Flat Rapids which goes into Skead Lake . At the narrows on this lake we stopped for a lunch break . The campsite we stopped at was more barren than most being on a lot of bedrock but it did have some very good flat tent pads . When we got to Flat Rapids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try these or take the portage . Since Flat Rapids is a series of 4 rapids that ca n't be seen until you 're on top of them it would be bad if we had to turn around half way through . But considering what the other rapids had been like so far , Dan D and I decided to go for it . Bump and grind again for the first two boulder gardens . Had to get out more than once to float the canoe . The third set of rapids posed the greatest challenge because we could not see the entire length . Dan D and his Coleman pushed on through without scouting ( BAD Do n't  do that ) while I held back and watched his progress . At one point he suddenly dropped out of site . I knew he had gone over a drop but did not know how high . I could see the pool beyond the drop and waited for Dan to appear . What seemed like an eternity he finally popped into view with his arms raised in celebration . Now it was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit and got out of his canoe at the end of the drop . As I got closer to finally see what was in store for me Dan said my eyes were as big as saucers and my jaw dropped . I had a split second to pick the line to take between numerous boulders while being bounced around by boulders above the drop which steered my canoe the way they wanted not the way I wanted to . The only line to get through this three foot drop without getting hung up meant passing between two boulders which was a few inches narrower than the canoe but the current would push me through , then trying to miss a huge boulder smack dab in the middle of the run only about ten feet away . Any other line would mean getting hung up or worse . Dan did n't  help matters by pointing to all the boulders and yelling " there 's a rock hereand thereand there .. " <p> Now let me be honest and explain that this small drop we went through would probably not be such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However I am primarily a lake traveler and this was really something in my mind . I realize it is n't to be taken lightly as even experienced WW paddlers would have the same problems to deal with especially the fact that you could barely steer the canoe before the drop due to other boulders in the way . But still .. what a RUSH ! ! ! ! After one more set of easier rapids Dan D and I put ashore and had a celebration drink while we waited for the others to catch up to us . <p> When the others finally caught up to us we took off in search of our next campsite . This one we wanted to be a decent site because we were going to be there for two nights . I had originally planned on checking out the last campsite on Skead Lake marked on the map however after a short paddle from First Rapids ; Dan T noticed a sand bank leading up from the waters edge on the East shore . He checked into it and found a very nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish cleaning table . The table is what Dan T really liked because it was his turn to make supper . Lots of sunshine now . With lots of room I finally took out my solo tent I had brought with me . We still set up a tarp in the middle of the site just in case . It was fairly early in the day so we had lots of time to set up camp and go for a bath . <p> Dan T surprised us with a huge spaghetti supper . Lots of sauce with freshly sliced mushrooms , peppers and onions . Toasted bagels with garlic butter and red wine to wash it all down . His pack must have weighed a ton ! Later that evening we had a snack of smallmouth bass that Bob and Ron had caught during the last part of the day . <p> Day 4 No travel . We had a very relaxing day with full sunshine and hot temperatures . Started off with Boil-n-Bag Omelets by Dan T. Dan D and I took a paddle downstream almost to First Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught a couple Pickerel . Found out later they were not really pickerel but sauger . Dan D and spent a couple hours relaxing on our lawn chairs we had plopped into the water on our campsite beach . A drink or two later and I was getting sunburned . <p> In the late afternoon Dan D decided he was going to make a sail for his canoe . Sure enough only an hour later using materials lying around the campsite and a section of a large blue plastic tarp he had brought , he was sailing across the lake . But without any out-boards ( or what ever they are called ) he could only go downwind . But he paddled back more than once only to set off again proud as punch with his sail . <p> Supper was my turn and I made a chicken stew . After experimenting at home I found I could use all store bought dried ingredients . Re-hydrate and cook into a half decent stew using So-Soy chunks as the chicken . Funny , it tasted better at home when I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sodium in the meal we may as well have just opened a kilogram bag of salt and poured it into our mouths . <p> Day 5 10km total , 2 portages/rapids . With the last two main bodies of water being long and narrow I did n't  want to get caught on them if the wind picked up . I told everyone we were to be on the water by 8:00am . Sure enough everyone was on the water at 8:00 on the dot waiting for me still packing my gear into my canoe . Still , 8:06am was pretty good . About 3.5km to First Falls is where I told Dan D that I would not try going down these falls if I were him . Not that he was going to shoot them but he wanted to line down them . I still disagreed and told him so as he started off . I headed back to the portage where the rest of the group had already began . Tue to form Dan D beat all to the bottom . He lined and lifted his Coleman down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode the last half . This guy has no fear ! <p> The next 5 km is down the upper arm of Wendigo Lake . Back to cottage country , although there was n't too much going on at this time . It seemed longer than 5km because the lake is so narrow and has towering cliff edges for the first part . Very impressive scenery again . At the dividing point between Upper Wendigo and Wendigo Lake is a small channel that has been cleared out of rocks so power boats can travel through . Even with the low water levels it was no problem shooting down this short straight run right next to the Boardwalk that runs beside it ! At this time the take-out is visible just one km south . <p> Dan T , Dan D and Bob headed back to the put-in to get the vehicles . Ron and I had to wait for them . Ron did have one little surprise up his sleeve . He had left two cans of beer behind in Bobs car . After the gang took off to the put-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite refreshing to say the least . The shuttle trip took 3 hours because the Hwy 624 was closed for constructions and they had to make the longer trip up Hwy 11 and go through Kirkland Lake . Naturally they returned with some ice cold refreshments . <p> We ended up at my house around 5:00pm . Showers and beer for everyone except Dan D who had to get home . We had a steak , potato and salad dinner . Nothing left to do now but to sit around and discuss the finer points of shooting rapids , fishing , portaging and start planning the next trip . 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @qwx994055 <p> This trip can also be started at raven Beach down Cheminis mountain Rd and cuts the trip down to 3 days if you take your time or 2 days if you go hard . The first portage is a long one if you have supplies I sugest bringing two ropes and walk your canoe down the dam from the shore . Took us ( 2 people ) 1hr to portage to corset lake . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , but probly less then 1 min walk . Except that last portage it was a long one aswell but there 's a camping spot so unpack camp the night and move in the morning . Water was low for most of the trip making us have to portage most rapids instead of taking them as it was in July . This trip would be better to take in early spring . <p> Submitted by : Mathew on 2012-02-29 <p> The fishing was mostly Large Pike and Bass . You could see the bass in the water when walking along the shore at the camping areas the bass would jet out from the rocks . Tones of bass we caught our klimit in bass every day .

I found the route between Snowbird and Kasba Lakes unclear . <p> Allan Jacobs , CCR Routes Coordinator 134054 @qwx994054 <p> July 6 . Arrived at Lynn Lake , Manitoba , by train from Winnipeg in early morning . In the afternoon , a Chiupka Airways PBY Canso , with Stan Elliott pilot , flew us to the south end of Snowbird Lake . Flight time : 2 hours , 20 min. , distance : 280 miles . Snowbird appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kazan River . Paddled 3 miles to outlet of lake . A short rapid at the outlet consists of a fast chute around a right turn , with large standing waves . Approached on the right ; found it difficult to scout or line down because of high water and brushy banks . Ran cautiously along right shore . Estimated flow at 1500 cubic feet per sec . Camped on an open hill one mile below on the right . <p> July 7 . Paddled 13 miles down Obre Lake . Ran mild rapid at outlet of Obre . Paddled 4 miles more , camped on east shore of Atzinging Lake . <p> July 8 . Paddled 7 miles to outlet of Atzinging ; ran mild rapid there . Then paddled 2 miles through Bourassa Lake , and ran another mild rapid . Paddled 7 miles , mostly small lakelets but some narrows with good current , to a heavy rapid which we lined and waded down on the left . Paddled 3 miles through a lake . Ran several minor rapids in the next 3 miles . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paddled 2 miles down small lake , and came to heavy rapid with 10-foot drop ; portaged right 100 yards . Camped one mile below on right . <p> July 9 . In 2 miles , came to heavy rapid with 15-foot drop . Waded down on right 200 yards . Mostly small lakes and slow current remainder of distance to Kasba Lake , with low swampy shores , except 8 miles above Kasba a 2-mile stretch of easy rapids begins . Camped at the first good spot , an open hill on the right ( possibly an island ) one mile south of the point where tributary empties into western bay of Kasba . Total distance for day : 25 miles . <p> July 10 . Paddled 5 miles across bay to an esker . Lifted canoes 10 yards across narrow part of this esker , avoiding several miles paddle around its southern tip . Paddled 14 miles up western shore of Kasba to narrows , and camped . <p> July 12 . Paddled 6 miles to outlet of Kasba and start of Kazan River . Estimated flow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 feet deep , with 3 mph current . In one mile there is a heavy rapid which runs for 200 yards , then turns left and ends in a sharp drop over boulders . Lined and waded canoes down right bank , difficult because of high water and brush along banks . Left bank would have been easier . For the remaining 19 miles to Tabane Lake , the river is mostly narrow , deep , and swift , with many easy rapids . In a few places it widens into a small lake , but there was enough current to follow in such places . Paddled 5 miles through north end of Tabane , around several islands and bays . The outlet is not easy to see , but there is a slight current to follow . Below Tabane , swift water continues one mile to a heavy rapid . Camped just above rapid on right . <p> July 15 . Ran heavy rapid on the left . In one mile came to another strong rapid which we also ran on the left . Then one mile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles long . Camped on an island 24 miles down the lake , just beyond the tree line . <p> July 14 , 15 . Paddled to Ennadai weather station , and camped there two nights . Picked up supplies flown in for us by Chiupka Airways . Supplies are not sold at this station , but huge meals are provided by Dept. of Transport at $2.50 per meal . <p> July 16 . Paddled to outlet of Ennadai . Beginning just below the outlet are 2 miles of deep unobstructed rapids , easily run . The remaining 32 miles to Dimma Lake alternate between deep , swift river and several small lakes with slow current , except for one rapid mentioned below . Camped on the left 16 miles beyond Ennadai Lake . Although beyond the tree line , there are good stands of spruce and larch in this section . <p> July 17 . Paddled only 12 miles because of headwinds . Camped on the left shore of small lake . Eskimo works such as tent rings , inukshuks , and wooden implements start appearing more frequently here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 . In 3 miles came to heavy rapid , ran on right . Paddled 3 miles more to Dimma Lake . Prominent Eskimo grave on left coming into Dimma . Paddled 14 miles down Dimma , and camped on left at narrows . <p> July 19 . Paddled 29 miles through several lakes . No rapids , but strong current between the lakes . Estimated flow 20,000 cfs . Camped one mile south of 62 degrees latitude . <p> July 20 . Paddled 28 miles , again partly on small lakes , partly river with good current . Ran one moderate rapid on the right . This rapid was indicated on our map , but marked incorrectly one mile north of its actual location . Camped on left one mile above Angikuni Lake . <p> July 21 . Paddled 15 miles around west end of Angikuni . Camped on south end of large peninsula . <p> July 22 . Windbound . Hiked across peninsula . It appears that one could portage about 1/4 mile across the neck of this peninsula , thereby saving several miles paddle around it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of this peninsula is quite scenic , also important Eskimo camp , and probably favorite caribou crossing . <p> July 23 . Windy . Paddled only 9 miles . Camped on southern tip of large peninsula near center of lake . <p> July 24 . Still windy . Paddled only 12 miles . Camped at north end of lake on low land . Willow fuel scarce here , but wind plentiful . <p> July 25 . Paddled 4 miles to outlet of lake . Ran long rapid in narrow section of river , deep and swift , but not difficult . The next 30 miles have strong current , except for two small lakes . At the end of this section , 3 miles below the second lake , we came to a 20-foot falls , and camped on the right . <p> July 26 . There are three drops here which , except for Kazan Falls , are the most spectacular on the river . Portaged the first drop ( 20-foot falls where we camped ) 80 yards on the right . Then paddled cautiously along right shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we portaged 200 yards on the right . Then lined down right shore 1/2 mile to third drop , a 20-foot cascade . Portage here was 1/4 mile on right over the top of a hill . This is the most scenic of the three drops because of the high cliffs . We launched at the foot of this gorge in a moderate rapid , which gradually diminished . For the next 10 miles , river alternates between fast current and mild rapids , all easily run . Then there is a 5-mile stretch containing three strong rapids , all of which we ran after scouting . The last of these is the strongest , and drops about 8 feet . We found a safe channel along the right shore . Then two large islands are passed , the river turns abruptly north , and becomes mostly smooth with fast current . Seven miles past this turn a mild shallow rapid occurs , at which we camped on the right . <p> July 27 . In 2 miles , some islands are passed . Two miles beyond these the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none difficult . The current then slackens as it enters a 3-mile lake . At the outlet of this small lake a 10-foot drop occurs . We ran the upper part of this drop easily on the left , and portaged over the lower drop 50 yards on the left . In 4 miles the river drops sharply 2 feet over a ledge , which we ran cautiously . Had we approached on the left shore rather than the right , it could have been run more easily . Below here the current gradually slackens as the river widens and enters Yathkyed Lake . Found our second food cache in a steel drum on a prominent point on the left shore , and camped there . This is evidently an important caribou crossing , and site of large Eskimo encampment . No spruce trees were seen beyond here . <p> July 28 . Paddled 18 miles on Yathkyed , staying close to west and north shores because of wind , and camped on large island . View of entire lake from top of island . Willow fuel very scarce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of lake to a narrow neck in a peninsula . Portaged 275 yards across this neck , saving 5 miles of paddling around . Portage was low , grassy , and wet , but footing was good . Canoes were dragged across . Paddled 6 miles to outlet of lake . Here we went to the right of a large island and through a narrows , at the start of which was a heavy current and minor rapid . Below this island , the river turns right in a heavy rapid with 5 foot drop , which we ran cautiously on the left . Camped at foot of rapid . No fuel here . <p> July 30 . After 3 miles of good current , the river turns right with a long heavy rapid having 10-foot drop , narrow at the top , very broad and shallow at the bottom where it empties into a shallow lake . We lined down the right shore 100 yards , then ran the remainder . Probably could have run all of it along the left shore . There is fair current down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the right with fast current . Four miles downstream a long mild rapid begins . The next 4 miles contain several minor rapids and fast current past many islands . We then passed through a shallow lake with good current for a few miles . Then the river breaks into several confusing shallow channels around islands , not shown on our maps . We chose the right-most channel , which proved to be long , very shallow , and slow . After paddling about 4 miles down this channel , we came into a large lake . Camped at prominent outcropping on right shore . <p> July 31 . Paddled 15 miles to end of lake . Chose to exit from lake by what we thought was alternate western outlet , because of wind . Turned out to be not an outlet as shown on map , but dead-end . Camped in marshy area . No fuel . <p> Aug. 1 . Paddled back a few miles , finally found outlet . Ran minor rapid at outlet . In 3 miles , ran slightly heavier rapid on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a small lake . There is some current in this lake , which is 4 miles long . At outlet of this lake , the river narrows and a minor rapid occurs . Then the river becomes very wide for 4 miles , at the end of which it turns sharply left with a heavy rapid , at which we camped after running the upper part on the left . <p> Aug. 2 . We lined down the remainder of this rapid on the left , and lifted over the last drop . Two miles below is a minor rapid , and 4 miles more another just above the mouth of Kunwak River . Good current then leads into Thirty Mile Lake . In some parts of this lake there is fair current , in other parts very little . We followed the south shore because of wind , and had some trouble entering dead-end bays not detailed on our map . Better to stay near center of lake and follow current if possible . Camped on south shore . <p> Aug. 3 . Paddled to outlet of lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one mile a very heavy rapid occurs , 15-foot drop . We ran halfway down on the left , then portaged 50 yards , and lined down the final 100 yards . In the next 12 miles , two minor rapids occur . Then the river turns north , and after 6 miles of good current , we came to the head of a heavy rapid that marks the beginning of Kazan Falls . We alternately lined and ran 1/2 mile on the right , and camped . Fuel scarce . <p> Aug. 4 . Laid over a day to visit the falls . The rapid above is about 3/4 mile long , at the end of which the river breaks into many channels and falls 40 feet between jagged buttresses into a gorge . The river then forms into a single channel again and races for one mile through a spectacular gorge , forming great surges , boils , and whirlpools . The gorge has vertical rock walls on both sides 40 feet high , and varies In width from 100 to 200 feet . The total drop from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorge is said to be 100 feet . <p> Aug. 5 . Ran 1/4 mile cautiously along right shore to just above lip of falls . Then portaged one mile to foot of gorge . It appears that the portage on the left shore would have been about 1/2 mile longer . Water was quite turbulent where we put in . Just below , we had to cross over to run a sharp drop left of center . The river continues very swift , but gradually slackens and runs through a wide bay . It appears that a portage could have been made from above the falls to this bay , and would likewise have been about a mile long , bypassing the above rapids . After this bay , the river narrows for 4 miles with fast current , then widens again with many islands . The river then becomes narrow again with fast current for 4 miles , then widens again with fair current for 5 miles . It leaves this expansion by a sharp turn to the right , and after flowing eastward 2 miles a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift for the remaining 12 miles to Baker Lake , and the last 6 miles are particularly rapid with many sharp drops over ledges . We ran all of these close to one shore or the other . Camped at 64 degrees latitude , just above final rapid . Fuel plentiful , <p> Aug. 6 . The final rapid is long but not difficult . Minor rapids continue as the river divides into many channels and empties into Baker Lake . Paddled 6 miles to Big Hipps Island , windbound there a few hours , then crossed 3 miles to small island near west shore , and camped . No fuel here . <p> Aug. 9-16 . At Baker Lake , we hired an Eskimo with a 30-foot Peterhead boat to take us to Rankin Inlet . But because of incessant mechanical trouble , we went only as far as Chesterfield Inlet in 2-1/2 days , and lucky to make it even that far . Flights out of Chesterfield Inlet are on a catch-as-catch-can basis , and we were lucky to catch a plane to Rankin Inlet after spending two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , and D.O.T . We could not bring our canoes on the plane , so they were left with the D.O.T . with instructions to ship by water to Montreal , and then by rail to New Hampshire . Rankin Inlet has H.B.C. store , post office , Dept. of Northern Affairs mess , radio-phone to Churchill , and landing strip with weekly flights to Churchill . After spending two nights there , we flew by scheduled plane ( with one of its two engines malfunctioning ) to Churchill and continued home by train . The scheduled flights down to Churchill are by Transair . Fare is about $l05 from Baker Lake , $56 from Rankin Inlet . <p> Canoes used on this trip were an 18-foot Grumman shoe-keel and my little 17-foot fiberglass canoe that was equipped with a removable fabric deck for use on large lakes . <p> After passing beyond the tree line , our fuel supply for cooking consisted mostly of willow twigs , plus an occasional piece of lumber . The willow became less abundant after Angikuni , and scarce after Yathkyed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel , if not right around camp , and by collecting it during the day , and using sparingly , we were always able to cook . The occasional pieces of lumber are probably left by fishing parties , prospectors , etc . There is no driftwood to speak of . Bring stove . <p> Black flies and mosquitoes were numerous throughout the trip . They were definitely on the decrease by end of first week in August , and by mid-August they were gone . They are said to come out as soon as the ice starts going out , around mid-June . Bulldog flies were thick at only Ennadai weather station . <p> Lake trout could be caught with spinners nearly anytime we wished , particularly in rapids . Grayling could usually be taken with flies in shallow rapids . No other kinds of fish were seen . <p> In the early part of the trip , daytime temperatures were frequently as high as 80 degrees , but this was an unusually warm summer . More typical might be 50s or 60s during the day , and near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annual precipitation is said to be only 10-20 inches in this region . The rain usually came in the form of showers accompanied by wind , so we seldom paddled in the rain but were usually in our tents . The prevailing wind is northwest . <p> We used the 8-mile per inch Dept. of Mines and Technical Surveys maps . These were adequate , but lack of detail made navigation difficult in some places . We also had a few of the new 4-mile per inch series . These were far superior . <p> This is a slightly revised and edited version of my original 1966 report , made by scanning a faint copy with OCR and then making numerous corrections . Obviously much of the information is obsolete . Furthermore , I wonder why I included so much minute detail . How many canoeing parties would need it , or even want it ? Consider it then just a bit of superfluity , perhaps a carryover from my days of compiling river guides . For a more lyric account , see my Black Spruce Journals , one-quarter of which is devoted to this grand adventure . 
@@107413348 @2813348/ <p> Does anyone have an update on the water levels in Nopoming park ? I am thinking about heading into Cole lake on the Labour day weekend and would like to know what the water levels are like on the Rabbit river . <p> I just happen to stop by the launch site for Cole lake today . I noticed the water level on the small concrete pad was the same as it was during august long when my wife and 10yr old and I went into Cole . We had no problems getting through the 5 portages . At each one , we portaged our packs and I lined the canoe . On the way back i dropped the wife and son off at the portages and I easily pushed the loaded canoe through with the current . Let me know if u need any more info Stan , I have done this route several times . I 'm on holidays this week and just spent the weekend in Black lake , I 'm thinking about going into Cole again on Tuesday morning . <p> Thanks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake was a rainy May long weekend about 10 years ago . The water level was high at the time and no portages were required . I plan on heading into Cole lake this coming weekend . Any suggestions for the best camp sites on Cole lake ? <p> I 've always enjoyed Cole lake , I find its not as busy as some of the other routes in nopiming . On several occasions I 've seen about 5 vehicles in the parking lot and thought maybe there might not be any sites left . I find that most groups do n't make it all the way into Cole and stay at the campsites on the 1st small lake or the 2nd small lake site ( nice site ) . I like this site because its still in an older growth part of the route and extends out into a bit of a point , good for a breeze to keep the bugs off . Once into Cole , 2 sites i would recomend are the one on the large island , and the one at the south east corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nopiming , alot of " dirty " campers use these sites . Last time in Cole someone had cleaned there fish at the campsite and dumped all the guts in the firepit , another site had a deflated yellow dinghy . And another time my favorite site on the southeast island had crap and toilet paper right on the only tent site . So be prepared to clean up after other campers in this area . Otherwise its a beautiful lake and the pickerel is awesome in the northend near the rocks . <p> Thanks Mike , Yes I have also had to spend a lot of time cleaning up after campers in Nopiming . It always suprises me that someone would go to all the effort of getting to such a beautiful spot then make such a mess . I once had to clean up a site on Snowshoe lake that had a smashed styrofoam cooler , 2 broken lawn chairs , many beer cans , trash and duck guts . I suspect that it was duck hunters who made the mess . I had some weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this extra " stuff " in my solo canoe . Then to top it off , my truck had been broken into . <p> I thought I would pass on an update on the Rabbit River to Cole Lake route . As of September 5 , travel past the first lake is next to impossible . The water level seems to have dropped significantly over a short period of time . After the first lake we spent 2 hours ( mostly pulling and pushing the canoe ) with very little progress . We decided to abandon the idea that we would actually make it to Cole lake before next spring . We headed back to try and find a campsite on the first lake but they were already full ( late afternoon ) . We did find a site on the lake just North of the first lake ( sorry do n't think any of these lakes have names ) . The campsite was great ( but needed a lot of clean up ) . We ended up having a very relaxing weekend . The weather was next to perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bugs were worse than I expected for this time of year but still not too bad . My daughter lost count of how many jackfish she caught ( and released ) . Stan <p> Strangely enough I was on this route the the same weekend as Stan 1.5 yrs ago and ended up turning back that weekend due to low water . <p> I was also on this route last weekend . The water levels are much higher in comparison to that labour day weekend . No beaver dams to pull over and we were able to make it all the way to Cole lake no problem . <p> We just paddled to Cole Lake in the middle of July . The water levels seemed pretty good . 6 portages , but we only portaged one boat and it 's contents and lined ( and bumped on a few rocks ) the other two Royalex canoes . <p> I really do n't know how long we paddled , probably about 6 hours . No one had a watch . We also only had one adult paddler per canoe ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . It was a really nice route , no other people out , as our trip was Sunday - Tuesday . I was really happy to be out with our infant daughter , get her started early ! The bugs were n't too bad , until sundown , and the site on the big island was nice and clean and in the breeze enough to keep the bug count down . <p> By the time we came out the water level had already dropped a foot . I would n't doubt if it 's impassable very soon for the rest of the summer . Especially with all the dry HOT weather we 're having . <p> very enjoyable route ! <p> " The world is a book , those who do not travel read only a page .

Canoe rentals and car shuttle at gas station in Edenvale ( 705-728-1676 ) <p> Submitted by : Laura Laird on 0000-00-00 <p> You can enter the Minesing Swamp via Willow Creek , at the NVCA parking lot off George Johnston Road south of Minesing . Early spring is the best time , before the bugs are out and while there is plenty of water . Once in the swamp it is easy to get disoriented . Basically you go west until you are past the level of the heronry , then turn north . You can also landmark the border between the Swamp and the Nottawasaga River as the River has densely tree-lined banks . Once you have turned north , you paddle parallel to the Nottawasaga for a while , then join the river by looping out east a bit before turning west . Some kind soul has placed markers at key points . It 's a great relief to see them after feeling lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hollowed out dead trees . Often they 'll drag green grass up to the top of the stump and sun themselves while eating . In the spring the Swamp is like a moonscape , a dead forest filled with 12 feet of water . There is plenty of wildlife , mostly waterfowl and muskrats . The paddling is easy , the only hard part is not getting lost . If you take your time it is about 4-5 hours to Edenvale . The fellow at the Edenvale garage has many stories of having to go in to get someone . Cell phone reception is pretty good and a whistle is never a bad idea .

The Northwoods allows you to " cram in just one more thing " by virtue of extendible internal flaps . The 36 " leather cross-over straps let you close your pack no matter how full it is . Features include side gusset straps , 18 ounce canvas ( doubled on the bottom ) , tumpline , leather shoulder straps , hand-hammered copper rivets and slip pocket with weep-hole on both sides . <p> This is a pack that will last a life time . It will hold all your gear and then some .

Aubrey Island has been privately owned sincw 1998 and presently I have bought the pretty island . We realize that the small island lies along a canoe route into Algonquin Park and that it has been , for many years , a camping stop-over for transient campers .

To clarify , permits are obtained at Tower Hill Marine , just south of the Kawagama lake road .

It 's like being a wild animal in a zoo , what with all the cottagers and such . As mentioned above , there is no sign of a dam or any reason to portage into Kimball lake . I can only conclude that the dam was removed and water levels adjusted for the benefit of cottagers on Kimball lake . The four long ports between Kimball and CrossCorner lake are a bit overgrown but have very few blowdown obstacles . Overall , they 're in comparatively good condition . As noted many of the yellow signs are missing , but if you look closely you will see a few axe blazes here and there . The Kimball side of the P2700 is marked by a plywood triangle . About 700 metres into this port there is a fork to the right , crossing the creek over a bridge , and the continuing portage to the left is not signed in any way .

It has new signs , which is good going north because the south end of the port is a wide open expanse of river and marsh and not an obvious take-out . The P1000 into CrossCorner lake is also mostly level , a bit more overgrown but still easy enough . The south end of the port has no sign and is heavily overgrown . There is a large clearing there and I believe the remains of a cabin foundation can be seen at the north end of the clearing . <p> Submitted by : Jonathan Bishop on 2011-01-25 <p> In the past couple years I 've received the odd email from other users indicating that Livingstone Lodge may not be in operation presently .

It flows northerly for 160 miles to confluence with the Peel river , and to the only road access is another 150 miles . Always hunting for that perfect wilderness whitewater river , Nate Houser , Ron Honaker , Gregg Doggett , Tom McCloud , Mike Elsea , Bob Kimmel , Curt Gellerman and Mike Iwachiw , with 8 solo canoes , drove the 3,800 miles from Virginia to Mayo , Yukon , and from there chartered a floatplane which carried us into the headwaters lake . <p> Bonnet Plume Lake at 3,600 feet , was a lovely place , with bare-topped mountains all around and light blue water so clear you could see rocks 10 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , organizing , hiking , resting , admiring the surroundings . When the sun ducked behind a cloud it was cold with light rain spitting , but when it shone the jackets quickly came off . Fishing was good with 11 nice grayling being taken . Around 3 pm as Ron was cleaning his catch , rain mixed with sleet came pelting down . We were not alone : two guys from Munich , Germany , were camped just up-lake , then late in the afternoon 4 French from Marseilles got dropped off . We invited them to share our cooking fire that evening . The Germans brought 4 grayling and the French brought one , which resulted in two hours of fish frying over a poor willow fire , but mighty fine eating , and plenty for all . When the rain started falling harder it was a crowded , but warmer , wilderness with 14 people huddled underneath Bobs rainfly .. <p> The river exited the lake with 250cfs flow , but soon jumped to 800cfs , and perhaps because of recent heavy rain , the water was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mph , cutting into gravelly alluvium , with evidence of recent higher flows . Soon we were in a the little -canyon , but I find it hard to call it by that name . Its kind of a trough with very little bedrock , just a few larger boulders , and some narrowing of the river , so the rapids stayed in the non-technical 2/3 range . Though the river was much higher than normal for this time of year , it was no where close to flood stage . We floated past yet another group of paddlers staying in camp on this gray day . Twenty something miles into the trip we came on a class 4 rapid where there is a constriction through bedrock . The portage was just 30 yds . At lunchstop a couple guys demonstrated how -bush they had gone by eating leftover fish , cold , using treebark as their plate . Additional class 2+ rapids that deserved attention occurred in the next few miles , and half of a red ABS canoe , partly buried in the gravel , was seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braiding , though there was no problem in finding a channel with enough water to get through . <p> On the second day the river was bigger and uniformly gray , the shade of liquid concrete . Before long we were in another small canyon . The first significant rapid had a huge tongue in the center but a sneak route over a ledge on the right . Ron and Mike were bank scouting when Ron saw a canoe coming and said -look , someone is running already ...... Hey ! That 's my boat ! ..... oh shit ! , and goes tearing down the bank . His boat , loaded with all his gear and food for the two week trip , ran the rapid perfectly and eddied out . Ron jumped into the river , swam to it , and just in time grabbed the stern as it was pulling into the current again . This was pushy class 3 water , but not difficult . Then this short canyon ended , the river bottom broadened , and there was again a lot of braiding for many miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current we viewed mountaintops heavily shrouded in clouds . A noble bull caribou ran along the right bank , then swam across . Camp was pitched at about mile 48 . <p> Finally ! After 3 rainy days we got a perfect morning . While enjoying Chef Nates blueberry pancakes and Bobs country ham , a black bear was spied high on the opposite mountainside . There were many flowers along the way : lots of purple fireweed , a yellow daisy , green orchis and yellow arctic poppies . After a fast morning on class 1-2 sections we came upon another canyon . At the entrance you could see maybe -+ mile , get a good look at 3 distinct rapids , and note the 100 foot canyon walls , not vertical but steep . This section starts with a river-wide ledge easily sneakable on the left , then after 200 ft a ledge that extended out from the left bank created big waves and must be passed to the right , and then an even bigger rapid just below that , where river left is the place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third rapid , carried gear around , lifted the boat over , and ran the rest of the canyon light , while others portaged the entire canyon . I suspect that at a normal water level most of this rapid would be quite easy , except for that third rapid . Past the canyon , there was some more class 2/3 whitewater , with big waves and holes to be avoided , but this was easily done . <p> It rained all night , with gusty wind and temperature about 50 . In the morning , it was really not looking good for hiking , or photography or even laying over , and the upstream wind would make it real tough to be paddling . While standing around , talking over our options , a pair of wolves suddenly appeared directly across the river on the high bank . In the lead was a buff colored animal who stopped and stared directly at us . Behind and more secretive was an almost black animal . Both were big adults . After they had studied us for 30 seconds they moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us went for a hike , initially through spruce up to 30 feet tall and 4 inches diameter , then as altitude was gained , on steep scree slopes where the footing was bad and the vegetation small and sparse . We reached a ridge and followed it higher , enjoying the scenery . This mountain is U-shaped , and we looked into the open part of the U , a bare bowl slowly filling with loose rock falling from high above . Visible far below was the Bonnet Plume and the tiny , colorful domes of our tents . Our descent back toward camp was along a remarkable little creek that flowed through a sharp-sided cleft in solid rock in a series of falls and potholes-a kind of -seven teacups of the north . <p> The morning of 2 Aug. was clear with frost on the packs . There are massive gravel flats on the valley bottom of the Bonnet Plume , and following the channel swiftly back and forth across these flats became the name of the game for several days . The gradient stayed at 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,000 cfs volume , but only occasional large waves . About 20 miles downriver we spotted 4 sheep , first at river level , then they climbed a hill and could be seen moving along the crest for some time . After a 26 mile day we reached Fairchild Creek and set up camp on the bar across its multiple mouths . It had become quite warm in the late afternoon , perhaps 80 , and after my camp chores were completed I took a bath , the first since Whitehorse , 8 days ago . <p> Morning was very windy , making it feel real cold . Being well ahead of schedule , we decided that taking a day for fishing was in order , but since we 'd not had a hit from the muddy river , if we were to catch anything we would have to hike to a clear-water lake . Several of the guys picked up a trail which lead to Fairchild lake , but I decided to tow my canoe up the creek and try to reach Fairchild lake by this route . The upstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across , and streamside brush was rarely a problem . The gradient was uniform , perhaps 50 fpm , and with 250cs the current was constantly fast . But after 1 -+ hours a canyon blocked progress . Ron and I grabbed our rods and hiked over the hill , soon finding a spectacular little fall of 30 feet-definitely not canoeable . Gazing upstream , this valley looked a lot like a beaver meadow . There were heavily used moose/caribou trails parallel to the creek , but walking in them was a heavy slog . Eventually we reached Fairchild lake and found the others casting . Its a very pretty place , a crystal clear blue lake , long and narrow , cradled below tree-covered steep hills . While we did n't  catch a trout on every cast , there were soon enough for supper . I hiked back to my boat and paddled downstream . In minutes I had overtaken Ron , who had a 15 minute head start , and a bit later I met up with the other guys who had hiked the overland route . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first ever descent of Fairchild Creek , perhaps 4 miles , and a joy it was ! While we were gone from camp the wind had died , the temperature warmed-a lot , and this had brought out a swarm of gnats . These small flies looked a little like blackflies but did not bite-yet there were so many they were in everything , on our skin , in the eyes , in the food . They took away the pleasure of an otherwise pleasant evening . At 10pm there was enough light in the tent for me to write trip notes . Up here it really never got completely dark all night long . <p> On 4 Aug. we awoke to a thick fog hanging 500 feet above , but temperature was mild . The river continued to have a uniform gradient : its a small-rock river , with a lot of braiding but never a problem finding a channel with enough water to float a boat . Within a half hour of launching , a small grizzly , came down the right bank , swam an erratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pulled himself out on river left . He shook himself off and did an odd little dance , jumping around for no obvious reason . Later I saw several mergansers , a small falcon , some loons in flight and a couple crows . After lunch we came upon a group of 4 caribou cows with 4 calves out on an exposed gravel bar . Seeing us , they ran around , confused as they so often are , up-river then back down , and into the river to swim to the -mainland . And an hour later , walking a gravel bar was a small black bear . He seemed unafraid of us , just curious , and came in my direction . After shooting several pix , I grabbed a paddle and pushed off when he got 40 feet away . The mountains along this stretch of river have continued to be impressive , more vertical and more to a peak than the mountains upriver had been . The river was now mostly 100-150 yards wide in a continuously broadening valley , now a mile across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alluvial banks to a 50 foot depth . We pulled into a nondescript spot and set up camp for the night : a gravel flat 6 feet higher than river level , which had not been scoured for years , so had low growth and brush . Our progress this day was about 26 miles , and would have been more except for a persistent headwind . <p> 5 Aug Again a high , heavily overcast sky . Our cooking fire had been built in a dry gully . Upriver , across the gully , was mature forest , and downriver were our tents . Everyone had finished eating breakfast , and all but Ron and I were at the tents , packing . I was down in the gully and had just put the fire grid into its carrying sack , when from upriver through the woods came two light brown grizzly bears at a slow gallop . Being without pepper spray or banger at that moment , I kept the fire grid in my hands and stepped up onto higher ground . But at the gully the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiff , then turned tail and ran back into the woods in the same direction they had come from . We were floating by 8:30 , a new early mark for us , and paddled near nonstop until 12:30 at which time we had covered 24 miles . After lunch the wind started to build , as it had yesterday , reaching a peak around 2:30 , then dying . We were not seeing much wildlife : a few gulls , mergansers , other ducks , and a couple ravens . The river was very full and swift when in the main channel , but there was also a lot of braiding . At one spot on river right was a 70 foot high alluvial hill being undercut , and as we passed , big lumps of soil and rock were cascading down into the river . We pulled into a river left gravel bar around 4pm , having traveled about 44 miles , and it had been easy with the swift current . Looking back upriver in the direction of the mountains that wed left this morning , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what can be done in just a day in a canoe . Throughout much of the day we had listened to the sound of sizzling bacon , the sound made by gravel hitting the bottom of the canoes , and proof that this river was moving a tremendous quantity of sand and gravel . <p> 6 Aug . The overcast was high , yet there was just barely enough light to cast a faint shadow . About 11 wed reached the mouth of Noisy Creek , but after testing the fishing and being unsuccessful , we decided to move on to the Peel . In the last half mile the Bonnet Plume braided into so many channels we really did n't  find a major flow , but there was plenty of water in these smaller channels . The confluence with the Peel was anti-climactic : no dramatic melding of the two big rivers in a huge whirlpool , great waves or turbulence . Just a quiet melding of the many small channels of the BP into the much bigger , muddy Peel . But the real surprise was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downriver . The current was fast , and with the great volume , very powerful . In only a quarter mile the river bent left , out of view , between these cliffs , and the dark purplish rock emanated a sinister -feel . But inside the canyon there was no narrowing , no huge boulders in the riverbed or bedrock ledges ... only some fast current and waves , but no real rapids . Really , it was the geology that made this place interesting : the rock had frequently-alternating layers of black and white-really zebra striped , and there were places where these layers were dramatically contorted and even set up 90 degrees on end ! The Peel moved right along , but was not uniformly as fast as the BP . We passed a place where there had been a massive landslide of several hundred yards from the right cliff down to water level-and there were still trees growing on top of the slide . About 3pm a heavy rain began , and at 4pm we pulled in at a gravel bar for a leg stretch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp the night there . We had made about 40 miles downriver progress . This gravel bar was different from those on the BP , the kind formed by water flows of 30 or 50,000 cfs. , and the rocks were big , many basketball plus size . How big was the Peel ? Couldnt really tell the depth , but 10 or 15,000 cfs would not likely be too much out of line . Camp was set back in the scrub poplars , which formed a dense screen some 100 feet away from the river and gave some protection from the weather . The mosquitoes started to notice us , and soon a whole lot of slapping was going on . After a spaghetti supper we sat around among the canoes out on the gravel bar , with light drizzle falling , to get away from most of them . Estimates of the height of the cliff on the opposite bank became a point of contention with guesses upwards of 300 feet . There had been some small rock falls from that cliff while we were watching , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heard followed by the sound of a lot of falling rock . <p> 7 Aug The threatened rain storm had not developed , but neither had any drying taken place overnight . There was again a high overcast-this was starting to remind me of a -dog-days-of-August heat wave back home , but in Yukon the heat wave means a high of 70 . The current stayed at 5mph and the cliffs at the same height and appearance for mile after mile . In places there were pebbles falling into the water and in other places the wind was blowing clouds of brown dust off the soil/alluvial cliffs . If you were to study the topo maps of the BP and Peel you would see a lot of braiding , and on the maps they look identical , but here on the ground they are very different : the BP had many smallish channels , but with the Peel there was almost always a single major channel which snaked completely across the valley floor , bumping into the opposite cliff sides . Sometime after lunchstop I saw a bald eagle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white patch underneath its wings . Later in the day there was a lone cow moose standing quietly by the river . Around 4:30 we paddled across the Arctic Circle . If anything , it seemed to get warmer the further north we traveled , but the sun had become brighter and there was a glare on the water . We had wanted to make 60 miles for the day , and we did that . At the end of the day everyone was so tired we ate freeze-dried suppers . Nobody was awake at 9 pm . <p> 8 Aug . I figured that if we were to make another 60 miles this day we were going to need a lot of calories , so I made a buttermilk pancake breakfast . The scenery along the Peel became rather monotonous . The river was big and flat , sometimes flowing but a lot like lake paddling , and we really just wanted to finish off the remaining miles . We stroked steadily until lunchstop , and soon after , with maybe 50 miles remaining , the river seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two cubs was seen . Then we encountered the RCMP patrol boat making its weekly river reconnoiter . The Mountie asked if we were interested in a lift to Fort Macpherson . We said maybe and continued downriver , but by the time he returned on his downriver leg we had decided that this section of flat river was not worth two more days of our sweat . Canoes , people and the gear was loaded up . The ride was a great opportunity to talk with the Mountie . Originally from Ottawa , he said he had really enjoyed his posting to Fort Macpherson , a community populated mostly by the Gwitchen people . Along the way he pointed out two historical sites along the river where members of " The Lost Patrol " were found dead early in the last century , and the new $2 million native peoples -healing center , which looked like a modern church campground with log cabins . Five more bald eagles were seen , more than we had seen in the previous two weeks . It was a two hour trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fort Macpherson , NWT , at only a few feet above sea level , marked our furthest north , 670 26 . After a burger and fries at Minnies ( $12 CDN , but I 've got to admit they were pretty good ) , the only -restaurant in town , and a fill of the gas tank , we started that 4,000+ mile homeward trip , the first leg of which was the Dempster highway , an all gravel , two lane , 400 miles , to reach the Alaska highway . <p> So it had been a good trip . Some fine fishing in spots , a variety of wildlife , weather milder than expected and water higher than normal for August . About 320 miles in 13 days , with no mishaps . It was an easy trip , in that you can make a lot of miles without working very hard when the current is a constant 6 mph . The scenery was clean and wild , but the silty gray water was , for me , a big negative . The Bonnet Plume would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermediate level paddling skills , and good common sense .

Well fix things , but some Routes are filed incorrectly ; check other regions if you cant find what you want . The Search feature http : **38;1512;TOOLONG , which accesses the same database , allows you to look for Routes satisfying certain criteria . We do n't  find this feature so useful and shall likely change it . <p> You might look also at the Trip Reports folders posted in Canadian Route Forums &amp; LONG ... paddlers post their trip reports in the Forums , rather than in the Routes database .

Last one to leave the beach , please ring the bell . <p> We were not in a hurry this long weekend so after a long drive from Toronto and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got onto the river Saturday afternoon at 2pm . <p> Water levels were high so we ran PL172 and PL300 , ran/lined most of the rest other than where you had to go around like the Kinmount Dam and the Three Brothers . <p> The first night we camped in the Dahl Forest ( no fires ) halfway between where the Burnt River meets the Drag and Three Brothers Falls . The forest is well marked . <p> Sunday we started at 11am and stopped at Three Brothers Falls for lunch . Stopped again in Kinmount ( PR235 ) at the Chip Truck for a snack . Ran PR40 and lined High Falls ( PR375 ) . <p> Camped at the next sharp left where the river begins a run back south/east ( you will see a railway bridge in a small bay on the right ) . The site has a picnic table and a fire pit and is on the point on the left . I thought it was a nice site but I 've seen other postings where some people do n't like it . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 11am on Monday and ran/lined PR60 and PL60 , portaged PR430 and PR240 .

" Centennial Park " in the town of Burnt River - parking free . <p> 1/2 hour drive out to 121 north thru Kinmount , right onto 1 and left onto 16 before the bridge and right to the dam . Get the other vehicle and then back to Centennial Park ( 1 hour there and back ) . <p> This was a good trip - four canoes - two adults/six 16 year olds . We did n't take any chances and stayed within our abilities . The kids had a blast and ca n't wait to go back . Now if I can just get them out of bed a little earlier .... <p> My 10 year old daughter and I did the 2nd half of this trip in the last week of August 2009 .

In fact that was the night a tornado passed through much of Central Ontario . We got a bit wet , but were fine . The trip is great for young kids . There are many places to stop and swim . Many cottage toys floating in the water and docks to jump off . The portages are n't too difficult and are well marked . The shore is sandy for the most part , so if the take-out or put-in is too steep , just climb up and pull your canoe up to higher ground with a rope . It slides nicely over the sand and grass . The town of Burnt River is nothing special . You also pass a trailor park/campground on the left just before you hit Cameron Lake that can be used as a take-out if the waves are high on the lake . As you get near Fenelon Falls there is no natural shore-line left . Cottages and homes have taken over .

We took our time ate lunch at High Falls and were done about 2:00pm . It really is a beautiful part of the river . Some of the portage banks can be steep . This year we are going to go from kinmount upstream to three brothers falls which is also a nice light paddle ? 2hours then paddle back down to the 11th .

The door zippers give lots of different ways to open and to configure for ventilation purposes , and are very sturdy . MEC also sells a footprint made for their tents and I would recommend it as it helps to save wear and tear on the floor . The tent is a bit heavy at close to 11 lbs but but we appreciate our creature comforts , the luxury of space , not being doubled over when dressing and not having to touch a clammy tent side in the mornings !

Soon after we left the park in Glen Allen , we came across what looks like a Boy Scouts camp or something similar along the shore on river right . There were picnic tables , archery and a climbing wall . Shortly after leaving Glen Allen we also came across a concrete road crossing the river . I forget if it was before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the start of the trip either way . Keep an eye out for it . The roadwas below the water , but not by very much . It appears that the farmers just use it to drive their tractors over , and I 'm sure it 's well out of the water in the summer . As it was though , it was about 20-30 cm below the water , and would have been a pretty nasty scrape if we had n't have seen it and carried around . There 's a little bit of the drop on the far side , so watch out if you paddle it ! I 'm sure in higher water it would be a fun ride , but not at this level . <p> The rest of the river was pretty uneventful , and the only problems we had were a few shallow spots which we scraped across . Matt had to get out a wade a few times , and I did once or twice too . This area is prime Mennonite country , and the river passes through lots of Mennonite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the fields . There was a manure spreader , seeder , some sort of disc or cultivator , and lots of wagons and buggies out and about . At one point in the river we passed two Mennonite children who were fishing . They had their horse and buggy tied up under a tree , and they had a small fire going by the river bank . We also saw more fishermen on some of the road bridges , and also below the large abandoneded railway bridge abutments . <p> When we got to the end of our trip in Hawkesville , we left the canoes under the road bridge , hoping that no-one would steal them . We then got in my car and drove back to Glen Allen to get Matt 's car and the trailer . We then drove back to Hawkesville , retrieved the canoes from under the bridge and tied them on the trailer . The paddle took us about 3 hours in total , if I remember correctly . We drove back to Woodstock , and tied my canoe back onto my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . I would rate this as an excellent trip . Since the river is dam controlled , I think there will be more water in it than in the Nith for the summer months . This means that this section may be doable all year ! Keep an eye on the flow levels on the GRCA page to see ! <p> Darren , Matt , Hil 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @qwx994055 <p> Did this section of the Conestoga on June 2/06 , two days after a heavy rain storm . Water flows were around 11 cm/s ( per the Grand River Conservation Authority ) making it a fairly quick trip - a little over two hours . There were plenty of swifts and even a few approaching class I. I was with two of my daughters ( ages 5 &amp; 3 ) , so I was essentially paddling solo . Canoer 's must watch out for fences across the river put up by local farmers . One of these has a gate you can go through ( with a little difficulty ) .

Turn right 5km after St-Edouard-de-Fabre ( route391 to Bearn ) . After gas station turn right to the " chemin de penetration " . After 34 km , ( good gravel road ) you will reach the outpost closest to Ostaboningue lake . Here is where you pick up your permits ( cash only/8am-9pm every day ) I do n't speak French and the nice lady there did n't speak much English , but we managed to figure things out ok . Here is where you need to copy down the campsites from the topo they have on the wall . The put in for " Route Brousse " is 6km from the outpost , she will direct you . The parking lot is used by fisherman to park also and very secure per my friend at the " Outpost " From the put in on Lac Ostaboningue , you head south towards Baie Cooks . Here you take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portages are easy , except for the 2 mentioned in the comments section , I will bypass a lake to lake discription . All the lakes where pretty , lots of white birch mixed with pine . I found it more like LaVerendrye than Temagami . The water and shore lines where clean . I did see one real nasty campsite , an island on Lac Ecarte had a dump around the back , a huge amount of trash was dumped along the shore . The shorline around Lac B.L . had some huge white pines . Some of the chutes from lake to lake looked runable , but I prefered to portage in most cases . Being solo , I was able to find rock outcrops to camp on , but I should repeat that group campsites are few and far between , so planning ahead at the outpost is very important . <p> Maps Required <p> Topo Maps ( 1:50,000 ) : <p> 31/M2 Lac Ostaboningue <p> Other Maps : <p> 31/M1 Lac Ogascanane 31/L15 Lac Grindstone 31/L16 Lac Sairs <p> Special Comments <p> I found the web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emails which gave me enough information to get started on plans for a trip into ZEC Kipawa . Some things that where helpful where : The outpost where you buy your permits takes cash only . Bring a topo for the route you plan in the ZEC , the map they give you is hand drawn and gives only what lakes you travel thru , you need to use your topo to find portages etc . They are supposed to have a map in the making for the ZEC/canoe routes but not when I was there . Ask for rates for camping and fishing via email , then copy the response and bring that with you . The lady who took my money used this when she figured out what to charge me. ( $6.50 a day per person to camp , $87.00 for 7 day ZEC fishing permit , plus a provincial fishing lic . ) Strange , but true . On the wall at the outpost is a topo of the whole ZEC with campsites marked . Bring in your topo and note the campsites on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups and this will be your only way to plan ahead . If clear cut logging turns you off , this might not be the place for you . I saw a few areas from the canoe that where clear cut , and one portage went right thru a clear cut . I have no problem with logging , I actully walked a clear cut and found it somewhat interesting , to each his own . There are also a few cabins on this route , a few on the big lake where you put in , then maybe 3 or 4 more on the rest of the route . Also , some fishing power boats on the 2 big lakes , but I saw only 5 boats on a holiday/openning day of fishing the whole trip . I saw 1 other canoe , 2 guys going fishing 1 lake in . No other canoes after that , no other people on most of the lakes . Hunting is a big part of the ZEC so I assume most of the large animals are shy , no moose , bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common . The Riviere Cerise is a very pretty paddle , I really enjoyed it , very peaceful . Most of the portages where short and level , very easy . The 2nd portage between Lac Robert and Lac Six Milles is thru a clear cut and over a hill , but not all that bad . When you get to the road on this portage , make a left and you will see the portage go of into the bush about 100/150 meters down the road . The portage between Lac Ecarte and Lac North is tough . It runs along a river that flows between the lakes . It starts out level , then drops down a rock slide to the lake below . Be careful here , you will probably have to line your canoe over some bolders like I did . Just hope it 's not raining hard as it was when I came thru here . Nice group site on Lac North and good fishing just after this portage . The fishing here should be very good , although I think I was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to catch any , just trolled mostly <p> Many of the portages , particularly those between Lac Ostaboningue and Lac Saseginaga , were badly overgrown . Contrary to the information above some of the portages were well over 350m . In fact , at least a couple of them were in the 800 to 1000m+ range . <p> NOTE : When you reach the road on the portage from Lac Robert DO NOT turn left on the road as indicated in the description above . We did this and spent an hour looking for the trail . When you reach the road , go straight across and you will pick up the rest of the portage . The trouble , at least for us , was that the entrance to the remainder of the trail was so badly blocked by deadfalls and new growth as to be pretty much indiscernable . But once we hauled through this mess the trail was visible in the undergrowth . <p> I am not sure that the depiction of the portage between Lac Ecarte and Lac North as " tough " ( again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portages , the trail was reasonably clear , not that long , and we did n't encounter any boulders that we needed to line over . I do agree about the good fishing . <p> I am not sure when the folks at ZEC Kipawa plan to do portage maintenance on this route , but if you do n't enjoy bushwacking it might be a good idea to check ahead .

Kevin Callan , " A Paddlers Guide to Ontario Canoe Routes " , not very informative on this route though . OUR TRIP ( Levi &amp; Bonny , Preston &amp; Mike , and James the yakker ) : The drive from TO to Hattie Cove is about 13 hours . We did it in 2 days going , 1 day returning . We rented 2 Swift Dumoines fully outfitted for whitewater from Pukaskwa Country Outfitters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 8-24-1997 ( Day 1 ) We camped last night at Hattie Cove , then Rob from PCO picked us up this morning with the canoes and took us to White Lake . Nice sunny paddle 7km across White Lake . Short P past dam , pulled out just above dam rather than marked P. 1st raps , main current is river right ( RR ) . River left ( RL ) too shallow , RL is a big ledge , CIII . We decided to lift over , did n't  want to dump right off the bat . SW after . P480 starts above 2nd raps . Top is some CII haystacks , then eddied out left and lined over not too big but too shallow ledge . More SW then a fun drop with big haystacks , CII , " Lantern Rapids " Good safe place to try some surfing ( how Preston &amp; Mike dumped ) . P480 is easy but a few fallen trees . A very rough campsite at the end by Lantern Raps . Some more flat water , we stayed at an unmarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next raps at P420 , which is actually on RR . A couple CII or easy CIII ledges , Bonny &amp; I dumped trying to do a surfing front ferry , got caught sideways in a roller . OK looking campsite along this portage , did n't  get a good look at it though . Some SW then next set at P405 on right . This is 3 huge , definite CIV ledges we did n't  want anything to do with . Our yakker ran them though , after great thought and lots of nervous anticipation , and made it through OK . The P405 is in good shape , has a sandy campsite at the end , room for 3-4 tents . About 2 km of flatwater , next stop is at the P95 on RR . There are 2 main channels , RL had the main current and looked too hairy for us , RR was a narrow chute , fun ! About 5km of flatwater . Next raps is a P80 on RL . Big campsite in great location , but has a table , benches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cut area from here . Can pitch a small tent on the rocks by the rapids . Probably room for 4 tents . The raps are a nasty CIV ledge , almost the whole river swings around the outside of the river bend , then into a hole or over a ledge next to the hole . Everything left of this was too shallow . It looked like there was a tiny channel between the ledge and the hole , but we sent our yakker to test it out and he got flipped in the roller below the ledge . He said the whole river wants to pull you over the ledge . There 's also a pretty big hole just above all this that could flip you if you 're not careful . And there 's a surfaced rock downstream of all this that could wrap a dumped canoe . We took the portage . 8-26-97 ( day 3 ) About 5 km of flatwater before Angler Falls . We pulled out at the portage sign on RL before the swift water above the falls . You start by climbing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first third of the portage by running the swift water then eddying out on RL , RIGHT above the brink , but this is the only spot along the very swift water you could pull out . Way too scary for me , I was glad to take the whole portage , even though its nasty . Watch out for a wrong turn near the beginning of the portage . When you see red flagging tape , stay high and left , not low and right . This Angler portage ( P630 ) is brutal . I got lost at the beginning , and slipped a couple times on wet rocks . We had to cross an old avalanche chute , ie a big pile of slippery rocks . After Angler , the next set of raps is marked on the Pukaskwa map as P600 then P195 . It is actually on P800 in good shape on RL , with some options . The first few sets are easy CI-CII , but be careful pulling out above Staircase Falls . Here you can join back onto the portage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the falls . Below the falls is a fun set of big , safe CII haystacks . ( Where we momentarily lost Bonny ) 1km of flatwater , SW , then a fun set of CII-CIII , depending on which line you take . We stayed at this nice campsite , room for 2 tents ( one a ways up the hill ) . James and I dumped here taking the tougher line through the big waves , then succeeded on our second try . Bonny and I made it through easily staying far RR , out of all the haystacks. 8-27-97 ( day 4 ) About 5 km of flatwater , then next raps at P580 . Can run the first 2 sets , easy CI-II , then pull out , P marked on right . The rest is very dangerous unrunnable stuff . A nice sandy campsite with lots of room at the end of the portage . Next is the long , flat section of the river between kilometers 32 and 56 , as marked on the Pukaskwa map . We could n't find any campsites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they must be little overgrown clearings in the bush . It was tempting to go explore up the Oskabukuta River , but did n't  have time . At the P65 there 's a SW then a 2 foot drop with big haystacks - lots of fun and a good picture spot . Did n't  see any campsites here though . We stayed at a site just before the P170 . There 's a short trail up the hill , then a clearing on a big piece of granite . No view , but nice except for the ATV trail passing right next to the campsite. 8-28-97 ( day 5 ) Raps at P170 : 1st set is a short drop with a big curling wave , lots of fun , but Preston &amp; Mike swamped . Then an easy CI , run RR . Next is the Umbata portage , P2240 on RR , do n't  miss it ! Its an easy landing in slow water , and you can see where the rapids above the falls start . Climb up another steep river bank ( I think there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head. ) , then join into a 4x4 road which you follow right to the bottom of the falls , the end of the portage is obvious . From the end of the portage , we paddled upstream a little bit to where we could land the canoes and walk along the riverbank to the bottom of the Umbata gorge , then cut into the bush about 20-30 feet until we ran into a foot trail that goes along the top of the gorge right to the top of the falls . There are a couple great vantage points along the way , and a great spot to have lunch right at the top of the falls . This footpath is much shorter than the portage . The falls are spectacular , 30m high with lots of water . Right below the Umbata portage is some easy CI-II haystacks . I did n't  get a good look at the campsite at the end of the portage by the Bailey bridge , but some other people were camped there . The remainder of the rapids are unthinkable for an open canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else either , according to our yakker . P350 : Brutally steep , a couple pretty inconvenient deadfalls . P300 : Starts and finishes with steep climbs . P95 : 47.5m straight up , 47.5m straight down . A gross campsite cut out in the trees at the top . There 's a better site after this portage , over on RL . It has a bear-box , steel firepit , dousing can , an outhouse with a roof and opening door , and 2 sandbox tent sites , one regular size , one pretty small . It has a nice view of the falls upstream though . 8-29-97 ( day 6 ) P215 past a very pretty unnamed falls , can walk right to their base or the top . P690 past Chimiwinigum Falls . Steep , but very well-developed , with stairs and all . At the beginning take the left turn up the long hill . Right takes you to the suspension bridge , extreme left is the continuation of the hiking trail . There are a few well-developed hiking campsites around here . From here is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big lake . If there are big waves on Superior , take the P20 on the right to avoid huge , dangerous standing waves set up by the current flowing into the lake waves . There 's a nice campsite between the river and a secluded cove at this P20 . It was occupied though , so we continued to Picture Island . Its not a designated campsite , but its an amazing A++ spot if you do n't  mind camping on a big rock . There 's a little patch of trees and some great blueberry patches on the island . We spent a day windbound here ( day 7 ) and did n't  mind at all . 8-31-97 ( day 8 ) After 1 day wind bound , we got going early the next morning . It was a bit foggy but there was no wind and the waves were small . We cut straight across Playter Harbour . The north shore of the harbour is sheer cliffs , so I do n't  see any benefit to staying along the shore .

In times of normal runoff , the Pukaskwa can be paddled from early May to mid-June . After that time , water levels make the trip a hike , not a paddle . However , runoffs are not always normal and local weather patterns can extend or reduce this window dramatically . Water levels are not monitored , so there is no way of knowing . Because the Pukaskwa runs through a bedrock channel with no soil mass to buffer rainfall , it is very sensitive to precipitation - a rainstorm can change the nature of the river overnight . By late May , most ( but not all ) of the rapids on the route are class 1 or 2 . <p> This river demands scouting and whitewater paddling skills - definitely not for novices .

From there we paddled 11km across a glass lake in stifling heat . We found a decent campsite looking south onto Trask Bay ( 560112 " N , 1034409 " W ) . <p> Day 1 Our first full day started on a slightly wet note . The preceding weeks heat not surprisingly was followed by a wicked bedrock-rattling thunderstorm that had us awake earlier than we otherwise wanted . We set out against a SE wind to where the Wapiskau River begins , Lavender Rapids ( documented portage #2 ) which we descended , in turns , with an empty canoe . En route , we passed through beautiful terrain , especially between West and East Knight Bays , where an established and oft-used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of the mouth of Lavender Lake we camped on a long rock ledge extending into blueberry-coated bush ( 560109 " N , 1033520 " W ) . <p> Day 2 We crossed the lake to come to a major rapid and magnificent waterfall ( 5-6m drop ) . The portage ( #3 ) , a little over 100m long , was well used and there was an excellent campsite near the outset ( 555908 " N , 1033100 " W ) . The next portage ( #4 ) was confusing because of the outdated ( or just plain incorrect ) details given in the documented route description ( the documentation speaks of a sand beach and small islet creating two channels . This may be a mistake , the author referring perhaps to portage #3 . In any case , there are no such features and the rapid actually a small fall is , in my opinion , certainly not runnable ) . At this rapid/fall we set up a tarp and had lunch at a decent campsite ( 560036 " N , 1032833 " W ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way to river-left quickly to avoid going over yet another spectacular 5-6m vertical drop . The short portage ( #5 ) over bare rock was almost like ancient steps down the face of a rock-hewn temple . The next rapid was hardly a rapid and , once again , is confusingly marked as a portage ( #6 ) . It became obvious that the water levels were very different from when the route description was written ( In fact , I have no idea what the author is referring to with the description of portage #6 except for the observation of what once was , perhaps , a former portage at the easternmost extremity where there are indeed reeds . I seriously suggest that the description be completely omitted ; #7 best describes what is actually encountered ) . We stopped just after this at a major , but easy , portage ( #7 ) around a set of rapids/falls . The excellent campsite ( 560008 " N , 1032447 " W ) was perhaps the best we encountered . <p> Day 3 This morning we came upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out of the narrow river . Shortly after we came to the first rapid of the day ( #8 ) which we descended , for fun , with an empty canoe . The next portage ( #9 ) is well described in the documentation . The falls drop significantly and spectacularly over a 30-40m length . The next portage ( #10 ) goes around another fall of 4-5m . The next portage ( #11 ) goes beside a vertical fall of 5-6m , after which another rapid ( #12 ) is channelled into a narrow gorge . At the following portage ( #13 ) we hauled pickerel after pickerel from the bottom of the rapid/fall . Finally , we set out across White Lake , passing two cabins immediately on the north shore ( 560027 " N , 1031840 " W ) . Portage #14 is also a natural campsite ( 555920N , 1031511 " W ) . <p> Day 4 We pointed our bows to Steephill Lake . This would be the beginning of our open water traverses . This would also be the day we left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our incredulous delight , the wind was more or less at our back to the very end . We stopped for lunch and fishing just before turning due north ( 555750 " N , 1030650 " W ) . At this point , facing SE , we could observe , on our left , the clear , blue waters of the Reindeer River running into , on our right , the dark , murkier waters of Steephill Lake and the Wapiskau River that feeds it . It was a clear indication that we were entering different territory . With the same stiff north wind ( not to forget that we were now paddling upstream ) we struggled to the bottom of the narrows leading to Royal Lake . Exhausted , I even contemplated sleeping in the dilapidated and hornet-infested cabin on river right ( 560138 " N , 1030522 " W ) . However , we continued against the strong current and were rewarded with a terrific established campsite ( 560152 " N , 1030602 " W ) overlooking the lake . <p> Day 5 We cleared camp early to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that the wind had yet again changed in our favour . The beginning of the next length of narrows was tricky to find due to the opening being hidden amongst the reeds . This is one situation where neither compass nor GPS can assist . There are virtually no campsites on the stretch between Royal and Fafard Lakes . The terrain is marshy and its a burn area . The day was getting on and our energy was on the wane . Again , at the opening of the river before Devil Rapids , the reeds effectively concealed the opening to the river mouth . The opening is at the NE end . Devil Rapids are fairly insignificant but it is n't possible to paddle directly up them . The portage ( #15 ) was nearly non-existent and it was clearly over the high , thickly forested ridge as can be seen on the map . I surveyed the rapids from atop the small cliff overlooking the river . I designed a way to go up them with some strong thrusts of the paddle in two segments ( 1-river centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over bare rock . This way , we avoided the 425m bushwhack ( #15 ) over the +30m ridge so , up the rapids we went . The prospect of a good campsite was no better as we entered Fafard Lake but we got lucky not far on ( 561207 " N , 1030830 " W ) . <p> Day 6 The days paddle began with another scouting and easy navigation of the reeds to approach Whitesand dam ( follow west shore ) . As we came to the dam there were the first glimpses of people and civilisation since five days prior . On Marchand Lake , we made a make-shift camp on an island in the narrows ( 561601 " N , 1031311 " W ) . <p> Day 7 The paddle to Southend was short and ended at the SERM dock on river left . We then hitched back to CanAm. 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @qwx994055 <p> We are two , have two touring kayaks , novice paddlers but willing to explore . Was wondering if this route was suitable for us . We live in Meadow Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 2009-07-05 <p> Four of us canoed this route , in the same direction , in about 1998 . It was one of our favourite canoe trips , with a good mix of open water and river paddling . The falls on the Wapiskau , particularly the first we encountered , were awesome . The Reindeer River , on the other hand , was rather drab , with mostly muddy shores and a burned out forest most of the way . Oddly enough , we found the directions in the route documentation to be perfect and extremely helpful , since several of the portage starting points were impossible to see from the water . The water levels were very high that year , so that might account for the difference . We actually encountered two extremes of water level . Once we left the Wapiskau River and entered Steephill Lake and the Reindeer River , the levels were extremely low , which was rather puzzling . We discovered the reason when we reached the Whitesand Dam , which was completely closed . We learned that the Churchill River was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , so the inflow from the Reindeer was being kept to the absolute minimum . In fact , the Reindeer was so low that we grounded our canoe a couple of times--in the middle of Royal Lake ! We had been dreading what looked on the map to be an arduous portage at Devil Rapids , but when we got there , it turned out there was hardly a riffle in the water , I guess because of the low level . We paddled easily up them , after I caught the biggest fish of my life , a 15-20 pound jack , at the foot of the " rapids " . Once above the dam , the water level was again high and the forest untouched by fire , so we finished the trip on a high note .

We chose to not tempt fate twice in one season having been robbed while parked at Canoe Lake earlier in the season . The road into the access seemed more rutted than previous trips and we were delayed slightly by road clearing equipment . The parking lot was quite full and the activity made me wonder if we would have company as we paddled down the Petawawa . Surprisingly , the few canoes ahead of us after the portage from Magnetawan Lake turned away from the small bay which leads to the portages to Daisy Lake and headed East on Hambone Lake towards Butt / Ralph Bice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the water we had lunch on Daisy Lake at the first campsite in sight on the Southeastern shore before heading East Northeast and down the Petawawa River . There is also a nice lunch spot or campsite on the North shore just past the 1455 meter portage from Butt / Ralph Bice Lake . A couple stretches on the Petawawa between Daisy and Misty were low but the paddling was not much different than a year and a half earlier when members of our party traveled upstream from Misty to the Magnetawan Access on the US Memorial Day long weekend in May . Although we were treated to loon , heron and other small birds and animals no moose were seen along the river . While intending to head for the large island on Misty , as we entered the lake a windstorm developed so quickly that we checked out the first campsite on the left shore . The one canoe still heading towards the large island was recalled with whistle blasts and we had the tents set up within ten minutes of landing . We were fortunate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain and the site was actually suitable for our group . As I recall this site had some inviting rocks down by the water . Since Misty can be reached in less than a day 's paddle it makes an inviting destination for a long weekend and offers alternatives for day trips in the area . <p> I believe it was at the last marked campsite on Misty that we stopped for a fruit and water break and there discovered remnants of a homestead or other site including bed springs , circular saw blade and other items which would not fit in anyone 's backpack . We began meandering through the Petawawa River watching for moose but seeing heron , loon and other birds . With no large lakes lunch was at the semi-bug free end of a portage trail . The one portage that stands out in this section of the trip is the 160-meter walk , which is located at the bend where the Petawawa almost doubles back on itself . Though short , the initial climb is steep , then over some " helpful " stairs spaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads down to the river . Although tempted to shove off to the left , remember , downstream is to the right at the lower end of this trail . While our route plan was to camp on White Trout Lake , we listened to thunder the last half hour as we descended the Petawawa River and meandered out into Grassy Bay . The camp site sign almost straight across Grassy Bay from the entrance of the Petawawa beckoned us and we found it to be a good site for our 2 tents . Although we were not on an island , as we unloaded the canoes one of our party dubbed this site Leech Island when several leeches began reaching for the Teva sandals as we stood unloading our canoes near the shoreline .. Since one of the canoes had dumped at a beaver dam mid-day we took advantage of the clothesline opportunities . Strangely , the nickname " Clothesline Island " was never mentioned by anyone . This site had some good hammock trees , plenty of area for the ThermaRest chairs but few good shoreline seats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed waterfront would have been perfect that evening . <p> Having done the 12 portages to reach the White Trout Lake area it was nice to be on some interconnected lakes . None of our party had paddled East of Misty Lake in this area of the park so it was fun to see new vistas open up before us . We paddled through the lower end of White Trout Lake , marked Trout Lake on the topo and entered Big Trout Lake . As we went past the island near the middle of White Trout , where we actually had intended to camp , we could see the clearing on the far Northern shore which was where the MacLachlin depot farm had been located . We also encountered paddlers who had arrived via the Opeongo Lake water taxi so we knew we were in one of those hub areas where Algonquin Park canoe routes and imagination join together so paddlers might expect to see others . It was Sunday and we saw fewer paddlers than expected . As we exited the passage from White Trout and entered Big Trout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was mid-morning and much too early for lunch we did stretch our legs , climb the hill to see what lay beyond and then examined someone 's attempt at a totem pole . We made a mental note of this inviting spot for later in our trip when we would return through Big Trout . We pushed off toward the portage into Longer Lake where we ate lunch at the Southern end which had more Sun and grass than the Northern end . Longer Lake was a straight forward paddle and the stiff breeze we had encountered on White and Big Trout was left behind therefor the easy 300 meter portage provided a dividend for which we were thankful . As we reached the 40 meter portage on Longer Lake 's North end we met a couple who indicated that the next portage could be run since the water was high and they had tracked their canoe upstream . We soon were back on the water after thanking them for the information and carefully stepping through the boulder / rock garden portage . We did indeed shoot the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply a matter of keeping the canoes straight . Upon nearing the entrance to Redpine Lake ( topo ) or Burntroot 's Redpine Bay ( canoe route map ) we cut through the first grassy channel to the right and came out on Redpine near a small island on which we found a welcome site at which to set up our tents . Once again , clothesline appeared like flowers in the spring soon after the tents were up . We also set up a Buckley Dry Fly , which we were intending to test on this trip . Although we had seen the Buckleys demonstrate their camping and canoe gear several years earlier at one of the Algonquin Outfitters road shows in Ohio this was our first chance to try out the fly . We deemed it a successful first " flight " although we had the wrong side up , but after placing a small tarp on the ground we stored our personal packs under the fly and for the duration of the trip several members of the party used this area as the reading room . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done this for years . Some of the men gathered fire wood , using our Sven saws to cut up logs into usable size while others began to clean up the area and make certain that any wet items were on the line . Eventually , the " testers " were hard at work . You do know about the " testing team " ? Every group seems to have one or more members who test the sleeping area within 45 minutes of arriving at any given site . Our group would soon shake out into those who sat and read , those who climbed into a hammock and read , those who panned for gold , explored the surrounding area and those who tested the tents from within . One of our members had severe blisters on his feet as he had removed his socks while wearing sandals which proved to be a major error . While the rest of our group brought Tevas and hiking boots or other shoes for the trail , thinking they were too heavy , he had left his other shoes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miles Redpine Lake Burntroot Lake <p> Night Four Burntroot Lake <p> Our original route was to be longer but we adjusted our paddling to meet the weather and , to some extent , the ability of our group to paddle and portage . Rather than head East out of Redpine Lake and paddle through Lake la Muir and into Hogan Lake we paddled North into Burntroot , hoping to find a site and enjoy a layover day . See Kevin Callan 's Brook Trout and Black Flies for the counter clockwise loop through Lake la Muir , Hogan , Manta , Newt , Sunfish , upstream on the Petawawa River to Perley and back out into Northern Burntroot . We chose to skip this portion avoiding ten portages including the longest pair of the trip at 1945 and 1105 , meters . After entering Burntroot at the narrows we paddled around two islands at the Southern end of the lake looking for a camp site . If you are checking this route using the park canoe routes map this area is North of the word " Lake " as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which identifies the Southern portion of Burntroot Lake as the separate Redpine Lake . As we slowly paddled this area it began to sprinkle but we were not impressed by the initial campsites although we were intrigued by the artifacts discovered . It was here we added an old anchor to the list of items which by now included saw blades , bedsprings , stove parts and water pitchers from various historical sites . We stopped long enough to pull on some rain gear and then headed Northwest to a small island where we found two adjacent campsites , sandy beaches and someone 's attempt at a sauna . Although this was a gem of a site , we spent the rest of the day dodging high winds and rain , feeling quite frustrated at being unable to truly investigate this area . This island was surrounded by some of the most beautiful lake scenery of the trip and we have marked Burntroot Lake down as a destination lake for the future . Since we spent so much time on this island now is a good time to share our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic foods during lunch and so I do not pretend to be original here . However , recently our group has enjoyed a product manufactured by Bigelow which is a honey &amp; jam spread which comes in multiple flavors including Black Currant , Orange , Raspberry and Cinnamon . This is used in conjunction with typical small pita bread and Jif " Smooth Sensations " peanut butter and squeeze bottles of clover spun honey . The straight honey is used up slower in our group than the jam honey combination but we count on the honey as emergency food as well . The one drawback to our present spread is the jars and lids which tend to pick up pine needles and the Lexan tablespoons which need cleaning post lunch . This is the one meal where we use more zip locks AFTER we eat simply to keep the sticky stuff separate . Over the years we have used $0.65 plastic putty knives as spreaders and other strange utensils but the goal for next trip is to transfer the honey jam and anything else of a similar texture into squeeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camping food tubes " with clips holding the open ends closed so we are in the process of saving the hold honey containers . All afternoon we had short periods of brightness which prompted shouts of , " It 's clearing in the West ! " , followed by 20 more minutes of rain drops which prompted shouts of , " It 's uniformly gray ! " and so on . The steady wind kept the bugs away to the delight of Sultan of Swat , the only person I know who would think to bring a fly swatter to Algonquin Park . About 7 PM , while finishing our cleanup from supper a thunderstorm blew in from the South and the thunder , lightening and heavy rain continued until sometime after 1 or 2 AM . The Buckley Dry Fly , the larger of the Buckley tarps , served us well on this day . Some of us crawled into the tents early in the storm 's fury and others chatted while sitting under the fly , enjoying the lightening display . <p> Upon awakening , the sky was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some sunny weather . Although cool during the early hours of the morning after we had been paddling for a short time we were soon back down to our shorts and tee-shirts . As we rounded the point and began to travel through the Southern portion of Burntroot or Redpine Lake we began to encounter light rain . As we approached the first of the 3 portages for the day the lead canoes discussed whether to line , track or carry around the rapids . Before we could come up with a plan the third canoe team decided to go for it against the current . When they were two-thirds up the rapids and beginning to go broadside to the current we froze along the shore Though our two adventuresome paddlers made it without major incident the other four of us tracked our two canoes along the East side of the rapids . However , at the next portage of 40 meters , we carried the canoes and gear as the volume of water was such that we did not feel it was worth another attempt at either tracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while we thought of pulling over to shore at one of the 3 campsites on Longer Lake to " wait it out " , we kept going since the campsites were occupied and the rain dissipated . By the time we made it to Big Trout the Sun was back out so we checked our maps and began a search for a lunch spot . The goal was to return to the small island near the outlet to White Trout Lake but upon reaching that location we discovered it was already taken . We continued down the South shore of Big Trout , picking our way through the islands and debated waiting for a family to leave a small site or continuing our search since we were looking for room to spread out , if not dry out . Eventually we paddled across the waters of Big Trout toward the large island along the Northeast shore which has several marked campsites . We actually stopped at the small island just off this larger island and found a nice area for the Buckley Dry Fly and our cooking near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the point where we once again had clothesline strung up before you could say , " Where 'd the Sun go ? " We were in time for lunch and began the typical campsite routine of eating , filtering water , gathering and cutting fire wood , picking out hammock trees , sitting down on the rocks and enjoying a swim . At the opposite end of the island was another , more open , campsite which had little flat ground . While possible to pitch tents in 3 areas we realized if we had been at this exposed site when the previous day 's storm had struck we would still be drying out rather than having already enjoyed a half day of paddling . Good thing we chose the other end , too , as once again the afternoon unfolded in what was becoming typical fashion . We cycled through 20 minutes of brightness ( not quite sunshine ) , followed by rain sprinkles , breeze and a repeat of this pattern . Although everyone had brought along books to read we spent quite a bit of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backpacking and horse trips . We were treated to hyperbole as well as fact , which is pretty typical of our forays into the wilderness . For " after supper activity " one pair of paddlers took a canoe across Big Trout to investigate the large bare spot on the Eastern shore . We had speculated all afternoon whether what we saw from the island was a rock slide , a rock formation , a patch of dirt or some other feature . Certain members of our group are great at instigating others to carry out such trips and this evening was no different . Four of us watched the two paddlers cross over and back waiting for the official report . " The spot is marked by a sign indicating it 's a sacred Ojibway Council Bluff " came the report . " Council Bluffs , Iowawho are you trying to bluff ? " If our team members were truly creative they 'd have planned an entirely different summer vacation . <p> Once again the morning brought mixed skies and as we set out to cross Big Trout Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked near the top of our packs . I have been intrigued by the name Otterslide since first discovering Algonquin Park in 1983 . Of course , I wondered how many others our group would encounter during this last stretch towards Canoe Lake and would the remainder of our trip be somehow spoiled by " traffic " . We did see a few others at one of the portage landings but nothing like the hoards at Temagami 's Sharp Rock portage during our first year in that area . Each time we saw others , they were gone as quickly as they appeared and very likely those parties were thinking the same thoughts about solitude , quietness and enjoying the wilderness as were we . Upon entering Otterslide Lake we paddled across the small bay from the portage and somehow managed to tie up 3 canoes in the wind even though we found no good landing spot . If I recall correctly , this was the only time we used the ropes in our throw bags . We were at the first site marked on the canoe routes map North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost directly across from another site on the Western shore with a very good view of the lake this site was a good lunch spot but it did not have as many level tent sites as we would have desired had we been looking for a campsite . I sometimes wish I had the nerve to bring a tape recorder on our trips . I think it is amusing how adults discuss the qualities of a campsite , especially when more than one tent site is needed . This discussion often begins while the canoes are a quarter mile off shore and someone is already asking the group to vote on what may yet turn out to be a root-infested , swampy or otherwise deficient place . The sky again squeezed out the bits of sun that were trying to appear so we began our paddle towards Little Otterslide Lake . We paddled around the Southern tip of the island and checked out the campsite which provides a view of the route towards Burn Island lake . We found this location to be the best of the 3 sites on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Louis , one of our rituals as we step from the canoes . Another ritual often observed as we step out of our craft is to slip and fall . Once again , in the face of sprinkles and wind the clothesline went up and several items were hung in the hopes that they would become drier . There must be a way of telling whether the wind flow will overcome the rain drops and moisture content of the air , but we fall prey to the theory that time on the line in sufficient quantity will provide us with dry socks . At various times during this trip , socks were found on sticks propped near the fire ring as if left as offerings to the rain gods . While sitting around the campsite a couple of canoes passed through Little Otterslide heading North . When one pair of paddlers , who seemed to be searching for a campsite , were that the next spot up the island was vacant they asked if they were on Otterslide Lake . Actually , they asked if they were on Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Otterslide Lake and it was one lake back . The response which carried across the water shall not be repeated here but they were fortunate to have a relatively easy paddle back through the creek which separates the two Otterslides . Apparently , they were an overly aggressive advance party . <p> The morning found continued cloudy skies and iffy weather so we slowly paddled toward the portage into Burnt Island Lake , anticipating paddling part way down the lake and camping near Caroline Island where we thought we 'd find some nice campsites . The portage was uneventful but seeing the waters of Burnt Island Lake was exciting . The last of the " real " portages was over however the wind was up so crossing Burnt Island would be work . We stayed towards the Northwest shore , aiming at the point as we crossed the first bay . We paddled across the next bay in similar fashion as we approached the mid-section of the lake . While some of our party had paddled the lower section of Burnt Island Lake on trips to Sunbeam Lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake so we were relying on descriptions of the campsites provided by others . The sites opposite Caroline Island were occupied so we continued down the shoreline and made our way back into a small bay where we found a large , flat site about 5 feet up an embankment . The site turned out to be an excellent location for our last night as we had plenty of space for the tents and fly , as well as hammock trees and reading spots . However , the breeze was so strong that anyone trying to enjoy the spot ended up sitting behind a tree , under the Buckley shelter or in one of the tents . By now , we had come to expect this type of weather and made the most of it . Around 7 PM a solo paddler came by asking if we had seen Mark . It turned out that his companion had gotten bored , walked off for a " two hour hike " and was still missing after 5 hours . We began to discuss the situation , alerted the occupants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the still-strong wind . We resisted the urge to go searching in the darkness but two of our group who had previously hiked across the peninsula behind our site took lights and walked over the trail . We had decided to get up and check in the morning to see if the paddler was still missing . If so , we 'd paddle out at least as far as Arowhon Pines Lodge and attempt to make contact with the park staff . A leadership group from a summer camp was going to leave early in the morning and paddle out to Canoe Lake and report the missing person . <p> As Friday morning dawned , two members of our group paddled off to check on the situation and while the rest of us boiled water and prepared for either a quick departure or breakfast we were surprised by the appearance of a fellow who walked out of the woods . We greeted him with the statement , " You must be Mark . " . He had walked away from camp , gotten lost , found a campsite and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either did not understand his call for help in the strong winds or were afraid of leaving their site . Mark put one of his jackets on backwards to afford some protection for his face from the bugs and hunkered down until morning . He stated that he had been walking for 2 hours when he came out of the woods at our site . We gave him some beef jerky and water then paddled him over to his camp site . Soon we were packing up to leave and begin paddling towards the Southern end of Burnt Island Lake . I continue to a chuckle at the wooden construction at the portage into Baby Joe Lake . The original rocky landing on the Burnt Island side would be sufficient and the timber " wading pool " seems to be out of place . The portage 's other end , with its large stairway , seems to be a more overkill than usefulness . If either of these structures were dismantled paddlers would still be able to get into and out of their craft and make it across the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its posted 435 meters but during low water it is faster to walk the whole trail . We reentered the creek at the second put in on the edge of Lost Joe Lake and made it through to the marked put in downstream but it was not a time saver . While fun navigating through the deadfall the water level was insufficient to make it a wise choice . At the portage prior to entering Little Joe Lake the trail goes both ways so make certain that you head in the correct direction . This is a short carry and a beautiful spot but watch the muddy landing as you get out at the upstream end . The bottom drops off quickly about 3 feet from shore . From here on to Canoe Lake , depending upon season and day of week , expect to encounter many others . Little Joe , Joe and Canoe Lakes were crowded with paddlers looking for an overnight spot and we were lucky to stop at one site to discuss our plans for the remainder of our trip . We decided to paddle straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were tempted to find a location away from the crowds by diverting up into Tom Thomson or Littledoe . We successfully navigated the last portage into Canoe Lake without losing any of our gear to the scores of others crisscrossing the path . Four members of our party had not been to the Tom Thomson Cairn so we headed over that way , tied up our canoes at the small dock and scrambled to the top . The view from the top of the hill is quite nice and provides a good perspective of Canoe Lake . However , upon descending the hill we found that the camp group behind us had tied their canoes up in such a way that ours were blocked in and we had to carefully navigate ropes and boats in the strong wind to extricate our canoes . Upon arriving at the shore of Canoe Lake we began the process of acclimatizing to life off the water . We eased the process a bit by eating our lunch on the beach waiting for Algonquin Outfitters to arrive and since we were ahead of schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean up the zip loc bags of junk and relax a bit .

@@107413407 @2813407/ <p> This pack is a monster , perfect for carrying all your solo needs . The padded straps , sternum strap , tump line and hip belt make it extremely comfortable to carry heavy loads . The downside , the two side pockets make it difficult to waterproof their contents . The width of the pack makes it difficult to lift the pack in or out of the canoe with out first turning it sideways . The width also makes it difficult to trim the canoe while paddling should you need to slide the pack closer to the bow . The hip belt tends to slide around and can be difficult to find once the pack is shouldered.

We usually put in between Blackfalls and Lacombe on the 2A bridge . We take out at the burbank campground . It is a good place to learn white water because the current is not too fast . In high water there are some fun altitude drops . Near the Red Deer river there are some fun waves to surf . Do not try this in low water , you end up walking most of it .

@@107413426 @2813426/ <p> I 'm not positive on the price , but I 'm close . I have found it to be too stffy and closed in for warm evenings . The mesh is too fine for any real airflow . Difficult to enter and exit . While it meets my needs for a lightwieght tent , the comfort level is lacking . If humidity is not an issue where you are , I would recommend it . But it is small . If you and your pack are below average in size ok . Otherwise get the duo model . <p> This was a perfect tent for me as I took it out on the Juan De Fuca marine trail on Vancouver Island . I found it to be large enough for me and my gear and it set up in about 3 min . I did have some concerns at first about not being a free standind tent but I found that it was not a concern as I had no trouble finding ways to guy it out . Exellent buy ! ! !

@@107413434 @2813434/ 134045 @qwx994045 <p> Located north of the famous former uranium mining town of Elliot Lake , Ontario . The trip is a steady three days or a leisurely four to five day route . Fishing is excellent and scenery consists of beautiful lakes and the rugged scenic grandeur of the Precambrian shield country through mixed conifer and hardwood forests 134054 @qwx994054 <p> Dunlop Lake Mace Lake Canoe RouteBy : Don Haig <p> This trip log appeared originally in Vol. 26 No. 4 ( Spring 1199 ) of " Nastawgan The Quarterly Journal of the Wilderness Canoe Association " <p> Reprinted with the kind permission of the Board of Directors of the Wilderness Canoe Association <p> This canoe route is a 42 km loop starting and ending at the Dunlop Lake boat launch , 10 km north of Elliot Lake . It can be travelled in as few as three days but to fully enjoy the scenery and early season lake trout fishing , plan to take four to five days . If proper care is taken on the two large lakes , it is easily travelled by novice-intermediate paddlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , an unusual weather formation over eastern Canada has caused the wind to blow steadily and gently from the east . This was great news for me as the wind would give me a free ride the approximately 10 km down Dunlop Lake to the first portage . Dunlop Lake is a very large , long lake that is oriented in an east/west direction and care must be take to paddle it in the early morning or late evening when the prevailing westerly winds are minimal . <p> I left the dock at 10:30 am and after a leisurely three-hour paddle , which included a lunch stop , I was approaching the portage into Ten Mile lake . This carry follows a creek that tumbles down the hillside in a series of scenic rapids and small drops . At its entrance into Dunlop Lake I passed over a large number of lake trout , no doubt feeding on the bounty carried by the moving water . The 410 m trail was in good shape and with the exception of a steep rise about the half-way point , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I reached Ten Mile lake , the weather was beginning to deteriorate with the wind picking up and the sky darkening . <p> I noticed two things about this lake right away . It has a wonderful , scenic splendour , being ringed with steep hills and cliffs . But even more striking was the water , of a very dark , almost ebony green colour and at least ten degrees colder than Dunlop . These facts combined to give it a very menacing feeling , especially under the quickly darkening skies , and I immediately regretted leaving my wet suit at home . <p> This is a big lake , and I as I had to cross it in a northerly direction , the strengthening east wind was going to cause some problems . To cross , I had to traverse two long east/west arms that were now being whipped up into whitecaps by the wind . The only way to do this was to head into the wind at about a 45 degree angle , quartering into the waves until I was halfway across , then turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was safely at the shelter of the first point of land . There is a campsite there that could be used if conditions were to prevent the next , and widest crossing . <p> Paddling around past this point , my destination for today soon came into view the stream from Hyphen Lake that tumbles down the hillside in a fall that can be seen from all the way across the lake . This second crossing is about twice as wide as the first and had to be made in the same manner . It is amazing how a situation like this is able to focus the mind completely there is no time for sightseeing as the bow must be kept at the proper angle to the wind and can not be allowed to be blown down-wind allowing the waves to hit the boat broadside and possibly swamp . Alone out on this big , whitecap covered lake , I felt very small and the slowly nearing waterfall was a comforting sight . I landed at the talus at the bottom of the fall and got out for a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope kisses the ground upon deplaning . <p> The Ministry info sheet talks of a good camping site here , but I was hard pressed to find it . The site is small and boulder-strewn and there is room for only one tent . There was also the stink of something dead that wafted by from time to time . I looked for the source with no luck and decided that it was likely a dead spawned-out fish hidden in the jumble of rocks at the bottom of the falls . At the edge of the campsite there is a portage trail heading up the hill to Hyphen Lake and after setting up camp , I took a walk up for a look-see . This trail accesses a series of lakes that join up with Flack Lake that can be travelled in a loop , returning here after two or three days . The trail is short but very steep and I was glad I was not going to have to haul my boat and gear up the hill on this trip . <p> The weather was quickly deteriorating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog , half rain and I hurriedly made supper under the shelter of a tree . A fire would have been nice but there was a ministry-imposed fire restriction in place , so I retreated to the shelter of my tent to read and do some writing . After a few hours the wind had not let up and I drifted off to sleep , hearing the patter of rain on the tent fly . I was n't expecting much from the weather tomorrow . <p> Tuesday <p> I was not disappointed . Morning dawned with the wind howling down the lake from the east even stronger than yesterday and , for the time being at least , I was n't going anywhere . The wind , while blowing in the right direction , was kicking up half-metre waves and that , combined with the bitterly cold water had me more than slightly intimidated . <p> After breakfast I fished for a while and then took a walk up alongside the stream to take some pictures of the falls and emerging spring flowers . By 11:30 I was bored stiff with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hyphen Lake , and as I neared the top of the hill heard voices . They belonged to a man and his young son who were celebrating the boys birthday with a canoe trip . I helped them carry a pack down the hill to my campsite where we talked as we lunched together . They were under a deadline and must not only cross Ten Mile today but fight the wind all the way back up Dunlop . <p> After lunch they headed out but had to travel a long way up the lake before they could find water calm enough to make the crossing . After about an hour they were across and gone from view , leaving me alone to ponder the question : if they can do it , why cant I ? The answer I gave myself was twofold every paddle stroke they took brought them into calmer water whereas I had to travel further down the lake where the wind would have a greater distance to work on the water and brew up mischief , and besides I was paddling solo and as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control the boat . By 1:30 I sensed that the wind was quieting down a bit so I decided to quickly pack up and make the run down the lake , staying real close to shore . That way if I dumped I would be able to get out of the water quickly . The trip went pretty much as expected with the only problems coming when I had to round a few points that forced the boat to run parallel to the waves . There was a zone in which the waves rebounding from the shore largely cancelled out the worst of the incoming ones and by staying within this zone , I got by without incident . About a kilometre west of last nights camp , there are two great campsites . These would be ideal for groups as they have room for many tents . <p> By 2:30 I was in the narrows near the western end of the lake and was now getting some shelter from the wind . At the entrance to the narrows , there is a cottage followed shortly by Ten Mile Lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance if needed . <p> The 445 m portage to Ezma Lake is found on the right-hand side of the bay just past the lodge . This is a good but steep path and one of the locals has even nailed a sign to a tree that says " Eagle Pass . " I soon had the boat and all the gear over and because of my late start , I decided to camp on this lake . The hills surrounding Ezma sheltered me from the worst of the wind , so it was an easy paddle down the lake to look for a campsite . There are several excellent sites on this lake and I picked a sheltered one near the portage to Astonish Lake at the north end of the lake . By 8 p.m . I was fed , changed into warm , dry clothes and in my tent doing some reading and writing . The wind was dying down , but it was still cloudy with a foggy rain I imagined that this was just what the inside of a cloud must be like . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . <p> WednesdayI must thrive on disappointment . Morning brought stronger winds and intermittent driving rain that even whipped this small , sheltered lake into whitecaps . This weather presented no physical problems for me as I was well equipped with quality gear and proper clothing , but it did play hell with my schedule though . The best way , of course , to deal with a schedule in the back country is not to have one , but sometimes the real world intrudes ( more on this later ) . By noon the lake had settled down enough for me to make the crossing to the portage to Swamp Lake . <p> There are two carries to Swamp Lake a 200 m one at the south end of the lake and one just across from me near the lakes northern end . This one is slightly longer at 230 m and it took me only a few minutes to paddle across to it . There is a lovely campsite at its start and the path is easy to follow as it winds its way beside the outlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sea of rocks and boulders , making the loading of the boat very difficult . <p> Swamp Lake is aptly named and is really just a ponding of the creek flowing towards Upper Mace Lake . The water is only about half a metre deep but my paddle san almost to the handle into the loon shit on the bottom . Halfway down the lake , I came to the other portage from Ezma and saw , from this end anyway , that it was clearly the preferred choice , as the put-in features a nice grassy bank which would be much easier to load the boat from . In all it took half an hour of hard slogging into the wind to get to the carry into Upper Mace Lake . <p> This portage , on the west side of the outlet into Upper Mace , is an easy 265 m path that brought me to a long narrow bay at the northeast end of the lake . I was sheltered from the wind here , but as I started paddling a fog started to close in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lake it was so thick that I could see little more than 10 m in any direction . As I made the turn around a point and headed out into the main body of the lake , the wind hit me full-bore in the face , forcing me to pour all my strength into the paddled yet even in this wind , the fog was still all-encompassing . <p> My plan was to camp tonight on one of the many island campsites that dot this lake , but as I looked out over the water , I could see only a sea of grey with darker patches that might or might not be islands . It made no difference in these conditions it would be foolhardy to leave the safety of the shore , so I paddled south searching for a campsite along the rocky shoreline . As I neared the southern end of the lake and the portage to Lake #5 , the shoreline sheltered me more and more from the wind until I was paddling easily through the fog . Paddling solo through a fog like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became more acute as sound replaced sight as the dominating influence in this small , grey world . <p> I still had n't  found anything resembling a suitable campsite by the time I got to the portage , so I tied the boat up and walked over the trail thinking that there might be a site at the other end . But when I got there , I saw just a jumble of rocks and driftwood certainly nothing resembling a dry , level place to pitch a tent . As I walked back towards the boat , I sensed the world around be brightening a little and soon , directly above , a little piece of blue sky was trying to pierce the grey shroud around me . Back in the boat , islands emerged slowly from their hiding places as if floating into view . I landed on one that has a beautiful campsite and by the time the boat was unloaded and the gear carried up to the tent site , the fog was completely gone . It was still overcast , but the weather had definitely turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was not the only one who had noticed the world around me had come alive with the songs and petty arguments of countless birds . <p> That night in bed , I was awakened by a sound so haunting that at first , in my groggy state , I mistook it for the sound of wolves howling , but soon realized it was a pair of loons . I had never before heard loons trill and yodel like this some of the songs lasting as long as thirty seconds . I suspected that it might have had something to do with one of their springtime pursuits . They kept it up most of the night and by morning the novelty of it ( for me anyway ) had pretty much worn off . <p> ThursdayWith the promise of better weather , I was up early and for the first time this week , was not disappointed . There was just a thin overcast that would soon burn off and the wind was gently wafting past my little island from the northwest . While making breakfast I dug out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upper Mace is very scenic , edged by high , rocky outcrops , and dotted with islands . The western shore has a nice sand beach and the fishing is reputed to be great . I had planned to spend a day here exploring and fishing , but the bad weather had put me a day behind schedule and used up my layover day . <p> Usually I could care less about schedules or being a day late , but this time I had made the mistake of telling my father , who lives in nearby Elliot Lake , my trip plans . He has absolutely no comprehension of why I am out here and never will . He is retired , has too much time on his hands and has decided he should spend it worrying about me . If I were to be a day late , I just might be awakened by the thump-thump of an Armed Forces helicopter , sent out to " rescue " me . <p> I was packed up and on the water by 8:45 am , made the short paddle over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy 215 m trail had n't  changed much since yesterday , but my mood and spirits certainly had . The portage follows a fault in the Precambrian Shield where a huge slab of rock was torn free during some ancient earthquake . It had dropped down on a 45 degree angle relative to the cliff face that it was torn from . Because of this steep angle , no trees have been able to take root on it , so it is covered in places only by a variety of soft mosses . I climbed to the top of the rock and was rewarded by some beautiful views back over Upper Mace Lake . <p> Lake #5 is just another small ponding , and after a 1.5 km paddle I arrived at its southern shore and the 340 m portage that leads to Lilypad Lake . This carry is located on the left side of the outlet stream and follows and exposed , flat ridge of rock for most of its length , giving a nice view of the small falls and rapids below and entering the trees only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> By the time I started paddling through Lilypad , the overcast had completely burnt off and the wind had died , leaving the water as smooth as glass . I remember thinking at this time that this must have been the kind of day God had in mind when he invented the canoe . It was obvious where this lake got its name just under water , millions of lilypads were about to break the surface . It would be a beautiful sight in the summer when theyd all be in bloom . There is one nice campsite on the right as you enter the main body of the lake . I soon arrived at the east end of the lake and the stream that leads to Lower Mace lake . There 's an old portage here on the west side , but it is not used much any more ass its easy to navigate the creek and pull over the two beaver dams that you will encounter . <p> The first dam is easy , but the second is a little dicey as it is steeper and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you not wanting to scratch your canoe , there appears to be a little path on the left side that will bypass this obstacle . <p> Lower Mace Lake is large with many bays , giving it the appearance of one of those weird shaped pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that wont fit anywhere . Shortly after entering the main body of the lake , I hooked into a large lake trout , and since I have no landing net , had to try to pop him into the boat using just the line . About half way through this maneuver , the line snapped off the lure , but luckily the fish completed the arc and flopped into the bottom of the boat . He weighed about two kilograms and since there was no way I could eat that much fish , I decided to release him that is , if I could get a hold of the slippery little bugger . That done , I got the hooks out of his mouth and held him over the side to revive him . Because of his struggle both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen minutes before he gave a flip of the tail and was gone . While I was reviving him , a school of minnows swam up for a look-see , perhaps thinking that in his weakened state , they could nibble him to death . <p> Lower Mace has no island campsites , but has several scattered around its rocky shores . I passed on these as I wanted to get across the portage to Claim Lake and camp there so that I would be fresh for the long portage the next morning back into Dunlop Lake . <p> The carry into Claim Lake is 650 m with two medium-sized hills to get the circulation going . Its a good , easy-to-follow path , but about 75 m into in , care must be taken to keep left and not to take a path to the right with leads to another small beaver pond ( you will just have to guess how I found that out ! ) At the far end of the trial you must go past the first part of the lake that you come to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ringed with high , rocky hills and is very pretty . There are lots of nice campsites at its eastern end and I picked a beauty that sits high atop a flat rock overlooking the lake , 10 m below . From here I could see the start of the portage that I wanted to take in the morning . <p> The downside of the improved weather was the emergence of millions of blackflies and mosquitoes . I put on my mesh bug shirt and tucked my pants into my socks , which kept all but the most voracious of them at bay . I do n't  like the mesh on my face but it is a lot better than having to hide out in my tent . I missed not having a fire and spent my time instead on tidying the place up , wandering around , fishing and taking some pictures . <p> As the darkness closed in there was a glorious sunset , turning the sky into crimson streaks . <p> FridayMorning came early and was accompanied by a cacophony of bird caws , tweets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed tight in anticipation of the long portage ahead and a five minute paddle across the bay brought me to the start of the 1385 m long path . I like to have at least one long carry on every trip and I especially like to have it on the last day when the food pack is a light as its going to get . I estimated that it would take half an hour to make each trip and as usual , decided to start with the boat as it was the heaviest and least convenient to carry . After fifteen minutes , I wedged it between two trees , took five minute breather , before getting under it again and walking the remaining fifteen minutes to the put-in at Dunlop Lake . It was hot work , especially in a bug shirt , but the walk back for the next trip gave me ample time to cool off . <p> For the two packs on a long carry like this , I use a different strategy . I carry the first pack for ten minutes , set it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry this one for fifteen minutes before setting it down and then walk the five minutes back to where the first one was dropped . I then carry this one for ten minutes and repeat the process . This way I am carrying for ten minutes , resting ( as I walk back ) for five and so on . That seems to make the carry go faster and easier . But even with this system , by the time I 'd had some lunch and loaded the boat , it had taken three hours to complete the portage . <p> There was a gentle breeze from the south and Dunlop seemed to be in a good mood . If the lake is too rough to paddle there is a nice campsite on the north shore of the big island , a short paddle down the lake . Once past this island , the strengthening wind started to cause some problems . It was blowing across the lake , and its direction became variable depending on how the shor3eline bends as it enters the lake valley . Sometimes it aided my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon progressed , the wind picked up speed and shifted more and more to the east , causing my progress to slow as I worked my way up the lake . <p> In all , it took me five hours to reach the end of the narrow channel that op4ens up into the widest part of the lake . The wind had churned this part of the lake into whitecaps and I decided that making the crossing would be too dangerous . There are three island here that each have four-star campsites on them and I landed on the biggest to wait out the wind . it took until seven oclock for the wind to subside enough for me to make the crossing safely , and after an hours paddle , I was at the boat launch , slowly loading the gear into my truck for the trip home . <p> This had been a very enjoyable trip and I was reluctant to leave . I took a long look back over my shoulder as I pulled out of the parking lot and headed south . 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give yourself lots of leeway to get across it . Canada Day 2001 was bad enough that my wife and I paddled 3 hours to get not quite half way up the lake , and were forced to camp at the mouth of a large northshore bay to wait out the wind . It lasted for 3 days .

@@107413445 @2813445/ <p> Night One on Misty Lake - several good sites on island , also North shore upon entering Misty <p> We arranged for an Algonquin Outfitters shuttle to Magnetawan Lake due to the reputation this access has for thefts . We chose to not tempt fate twice in one season having been robbed while parked at Canoe Lake earlier in the season . The road into the access seemed more rutted than previous trips and we were delayed slightly by road clearing equipment . The parking lot was quite full and the activity made me wonder if we would have company as we paddled down the Petawawa . Surprisingly , the few canoes ahead of us after the portage from Magnetawan Lake turned away from the small bay which leads to the portages to Daisy Lake and headed East on Hambone Lake towards Butt / Ralph Bice Lake . As we had gotten a late morning start on the water we had lunch on Daisy Lake at the first campsite in sight on the Southeastern shore before heading East Northeast and down the Petawawa River . There is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just past the 1455 meter portage from Butt / Ralph Bice Lake . A couple stretches on the Petawawa between Daisy and Misty were low but the paddling was not much different than a year and a half earlier when members of our party traveled upstream from Misty to the Magnetawan Access on the US Memorial Day long weekend in May . Although we were treated to loon , heron and other small birds and animals no moose were seen along the river . While intending to head for the large island on Misty , as we entered the lake a windstorm developed so quickly that we checked out the first campsite on the left shore . The one canoe still heading towards the large island was recalled with whistle blasts and we had the tents set up within ten minutes of landing . We were fortunate that the storm blew over in 30 minutes or so without rain and the site was actually suitable for our group . As I recall this site had some inviting rocks down by the water . Since Misty can be reached in less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long weekend and offers alternatives for day trips in the area . <p> Day Two : <p> Night Two on Grassy Bay / White Trout Lake <p> I believe it was at the last marked campsite on Misty that we stopped for a fruit and water break and there discovered remnants of a homestead or other site including bed springs , circular saw blade and other items which would not fit in anyone 's backpack . We began meandering through the Petawawa River watching for moose but seeing heron , loon and other birds . With no large lakes lunch was at the semi-bug free end of a portage trail . The one portage that stands out in this section of the trip is the 160-meter walk , which is located at the bend where the Petawawa almost doubles back on itself . Though short , the initial climb is steep , then over some " helpful " stairs spaced just about at the wrong intervals and then the trail heads down to the river . Although tempted to shove off to the left , remember , downstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail . While our route plan was to camp on White Trout Lake , we listened to thunder the last half hour as we descended the Petawawa River and meandered out into Grassy Bay . The camp site sign almost straight across Grassy Bay from the entrance of the Petawawa beckoned us and we found it to be a good site for our 2 tents . Although we were not on an island , as we unloaded the canoes one of our party dubbed this site Leech Island when several leeches began reaching for the Teva sandals as we stood unloading our canoes near the shoreline .. Since one of the canoes had dumped at a beaver dam mid-day we took advantage of the clothesline opportunities . Strangely , the nickname " Clothesline Island " was never mentioned by anyone . This site had some good hammock trees , plenty of area for the ThermaRest chairs but few good shoreline seats . The sunset was beautiful and a site with some more exposed waterfront would have been perfect that evening . <p> Day Three : <p> Night Three Redpine Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trout Lake area it was nice to be on some interconnected lakes . None of our party had paddled East of Misty Lake in this area of the park so it was fun to see new vistas open up before us . We paddled through the lower end of White Trout Lake , marked Trout Lake on the topo and entered Big Trout Lake . As we went past the island near the middle of White Trout , where we actually had intended to camp , we could see the clearing on the far Northern shore which was where the MacLachlin depot farm had been located . We also encountered paddlers who had arrived via the Opeongo Lake water taxi so we knew we were in one of those hub areas where Algonquin Park canoe routes and imagination join together so paddlers might expect to see others . It was Sunday and we saw fewer paddlers than expected . As we exited the passage from White Trout and entered Big Trout we stopped to investigate an island camp site . Although it was mid-morning and much too early for lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what lay beyond and then examined someone 's attempt at a totem pole . We made a mental note of this inviting spot for later in our trip when we would return through Big Trout . We pushed off toward the portage into Longer Lake where we ate lunch at the Southern end , which had more Sun , and grass than the Northern end . Longer Lake was a straight forward paddle and the stiff breeze we had encountered on White and Big Trout was left behind therefor the easy 300 meter portage provided a dividend for which we were thankful . As we reached the 40 meter portage on Longer Lake 's North end we met a couple who indicated that the next portage could be run since the water was high and they had tracked their canoe upstream . We soon were back on the water after thanking them for the information and carefully stepping through the boulder / rock garden portage . We did indeed shoot the next rapids and it was , in our water conditions , simply a matter of keeping the canoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topo ) or Burntroot 's Redpine Bay ( canoe route map ) we cut through the first grassy channel to the right and came out on Redpine near a small island on which we found a welcome site at which to set up our tents . Once again , clothesline appeared like flowers in the spring soon after the tents were up . We also set up a Buckley Dry Fly , which we were intending to test on this trip . Although we had seen the Buckleys demonstrate their camping and canoe gear several years earlier at one of the Algonquin Outfitters road shows in Ohio this was our first chance to try out the fly . We deemed it a successful first " flight " although we had the wrong side up , but after placing a small tarp on the ground we stored our personal packs under the fly and for the duration of the trip several members of the party used this area as the reading room . By now the campsite routine was unfolding as if our team had done this for years . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saws to cut up logs into usable size while others began to clean up the area and make certain that any wet items were on the line . Eventually , the " testers " were hard at work . You do know about the " testing team " ? Every group seems to have one or more members who test the sleeping area within 45 minutes of arriving at any given site . Our group would soon shake out into those who sat and read , those who climbed into a hammock and read , those who panned for gold , explored the surrounding area and those who tested the tents from within . One of our members had severe blisters on his feet as he had removed his socks while wearing sandals , which proved to be a major error . While the rest of our group brought Tevas and hiking boots or other shoes for the trail , thinking they were too heavy , he had left his other shoes in the car trunk . <p> Day Four : <p> Night Four Burntroot Lake <p> Our original route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the weather and , to some extent , the ability of our group to paddle and portage . Rather than head East out of Redpine Lake and paddle through Lake la Muir and into Hogan Lake we paddled North into Burntroot , hoping to find a site and enjoy a layover day . See Kevin Callan 's Brook Trout and Black Flies for the counter clockwise loop through Lake la Muir , Hogan , Manta , Newt , Sunfish , upstream on the Petawawa River to Perley and back out into Northern Burntroot . We chose to skip this portion avoiding ten portages including the longest pair of the trip at 1945 and 1105 , meters . After entering Burntroot at the narrows we paddled around two islands at the Southern end of the lake looking for a camp site . If you are checking this route using the park canoe routes map this area is North of the word " Lake " as I am following the terminology as found on the topo map , which identifies the Southern portion of Burntroot Lake as the separate Redpine Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinkle but we were not impressed by the initial campsites although we were intrigued by the artifacts discovered . It was here we added an old anchor to the list of items , which by now included saw blades , bedsprings , stove parts and water pitchers from various historical sites . We stopped long enough to pull on some rain gear and then headed northwest to a small island where we found two adjacent campsites , sandy beaches and someone 's attempt at a sauna . Although this was a gem of a site , we spent the rest of the day dodging high winds and rain , feeling quite frustrated at being unable to truly investigate this area . This island was surrounded by some of the most beautiful lake scenery of the trip and we have marked Burntroot Lake down as a destination lake for the future . Since we spent so much time on this island now is a good time to share our lunch menu . Many paddlers and hikers enjoy the same basic foods during lunch and so I do not pretend to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product manufactured by Bigelow , which is a honey , &amp; jam spread which comes in multiple flavors including Black Currant , Orange , Raspberry and Cinnamon . This is used in conjunction with typical small pita bread and Jif " Smooth Sensations " peanut butter and squeeze bottles of clover spun honey . The straight honey is used up slower in our group than the jam honey combination but we count on the honey as emergency food as well . The one drawback to our present spread is the jars and lids which tend to pick up pine needles and the Lexan tablespoons which need cleaning post lunch . This is the one meal where we use more zip locks AFTER we eat simply to keep the sticky stuff separate . Over the years we have used $0.65 plastic putty knives as spreaders and other strange utensils but the goal for next trip is to transfer the honey jam and anything else of a similar texture into squeeze tubes or bottles . We do n't trust the " camping food tubes " with clips holding the open ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold honey containers . All afternoon we had short periods of brightness which prompted shouts of , " It 's clearing in the West ! " , followed by 20 more minutes of rain drops which prompted shouts of , " It 's uniformly gray ! " and so on . The steady wind kept the bugs away to the delight of Sultan of Swat , the only person I know who would think to bring a fly swatter to Algonquin Park . About 7 PM , while finishing our cleanup from supper a thunderstorm blew in from the South and the thunder , lightening and heavy rain continued until sometime after 1 or 2 AM . The Buckley Dry Fly , the larger of the Buckley tarps , served us well on this day . Some of us crawled into the tents early in the storm 's fury and others chatted while sitting under the fly , enjoying the lightening display . <p> Day Five : <p> Night Five Big Trout Lake <p> Upon awakening , the sky was overcast and we decided to head back South in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of the morning after we had been paddling for a short time we were soon back down to our shorts and tee-shirts . As we rounded the point and began to travel through the Southern portion of Burntroot or Redpine Lake we began to encounter light rain . As we approached the first of the 3 portages for the day the lead canoes discussed whether to line , track or carry around the rapids . Before we could come up with a plan the third canoe team decided to go for it against the current . When they were two-thirds up the rapids and beginning to go broadside to the current we froze along the shore Though our two adventuresome paddlers made it without major incident the other four of us tracked our two canoes along the East side of the rapids . However , at the next portage of 40 meters , we carried the canoes and gear as the volume of water was such that we did not feel it was worth another attempt at either tracking or paddling . By now the rain was really falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the 3 campsites on Longer Lake to " wait it out " , we kept going since the campsites were occupied and the rain dissipated . By the time we made it to Big Trout the Sun was back out so we checked our maps and began a search for a lunch spot . The goal was to return to the small island near the outlet to White Trout Lake but upon reaching that location we discovered it was already taken . We continued down the South shore of Big Trout , picking our way through the islands and debated waiting for a family to leave a small site or continuing our search since we were looking for room to spread out , if not dry out . Eventually we paddled across the waters of Big Trout toward the large island along the Northeast shore , which has several marked campsites . We actually stopped at the small island just off this larger island and found a nice area for the Buckley Dry Fly and our cooking near the Northeast point and a large tent area just uphill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strung up before you could say , " Where 'd the Sun go ? " We were in time for lunch and began the typical campsite routine of eating , filtering water , gathering and cutting fire wood , picking out hammock trees , sitting down on the rocks and enjoying a swim . At the opposite end of the island was another , more open , campsite that had little flat ground . While possible to pitch tents in 3 areas we realized if we had been at this exposed site when the previous day 's storm had struck we would still be drying out rather than having already enjoyed a half day of paddling . Good thing we chose the other end , too , as once again the afternoon unfolded in what was becoming typical fashion . We cycled through 20 minutes of brightness ( not quite sunshine ) , followed by rain sprinkles , breeze and a repeat of this pattern . Although everyone had brought along books to read we spent quite a bit of time reminiscing about previous trips including canoe , sea kayak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyperbole as well as fact , which is pretty typical of our forays into the wilderness . For " after supper activity " one pair of paddlers took a canoe across Big Trout to investigate the large bare spot on the Eastern shore . We had speculated all afternoon whether what we saw from the island was a rock slide , a rock formation , a patch of dirt or some other feature . Certain members of our group are great at instigating others to carry out such trips and this evening was no different . Four of us watched the two paddlers cross over and back waiting for the official report . " The spot is marked by a sign indicating it 's a sacred Ojibway Council Bluff " came the report . " Council Bluffs , Iowa-who are you trying to bluff ? " If our team members were truly creative they 'd have planned an entirely different summer vacation . <p> Day Six : <p> Night Six Little Otterslide Lake <p> Once again the morning brought mixed skies and as we set out to cross Big Trout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear tucked near the top of our packs . I have been intrigued by the name Otterslide since first discovering Algonquin Park in 1983 . Of course , I wondered how many others our group would encounter during this last stretch towards Canoe Lake and would the remainder of our trip be somehow spoiled by " traffic " . We did see a few others at one of the portage landings but nothing like the hoards at Temagami 's Sharp Rock portage during our first year in that area . Each time we saw others , they were gone as quickly as they appeared and very likely those parties were thinking the same thoughts about solitude , quietness and enjoying the wilderness as were we . Upon entering Otterslide Lake we paddled across the small bay from the portage and somehow managed to tie up 3 canoes in the wind even though we found no good landing spot . If I recall correctly , this was the only time we used the ropes in our throw bags . We were at the first site marked on the canoe routes map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost directly across from another site on the Western shore with a very good view of the lake this site was a good lunch spot but it did not have as many level tent sites as we would have desired had we been looking for a campsite . I sometimes wish I had the nerve to bring a tape recorder on our trips . I think it is amusing how adults discuss the qualities of a campsite , especially when more than one tent site is needed . This discussion often begins while the canoes are a quarter mile off shore and someone is already asking the group to vote on what may yet turn out to be a root-infested , swampy or otherwise deficient place . The sky again squeezed out the bits of sun that were trying to appear so we began our paddle towards Little Otterslide Lake . We paddled around the Southern tip of the island and checked out the campsite , which provides a view of the route towards Burn Island Lake . We found this location to be the best of the 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of King Louis , one of our rituals as we step from the canoes . Another ritual often observed as we step out of our craft is to slip and fall . Once again , in the face of sprinkles and wind the clothesline went up and several items were hung in the hopes that they would become drier . There must be a way of telling whether the wind flow will overcome the rain drops and moisture content of the air , but we fall prey to the theory that time on the line in sufficient quantity will provide us with dry socks . At various times during this trip , socks were found on sticks propped near the fire ring as if left as offerings to the rain gods . While sitting around the campsite a couple of canoes passed through Little Otterslide heading north . When one pair of paddlers , who seemed to be searching for a campsite , were that the next spot up the island was vacant they asked if they were on Otterslide Lake . Actually , they asked if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had paddled through Otterslide Lake and it was one lake back . The response that carried across the water shall not be repeated here but they were fortunate to have a relatively easy paddle back through the creek that separates the two Otterslides . Apparently , they were an overly aggressive advance party . <p> Day Seven : <p> Night Seven Burnt Island Lake <p> The morning found continued cloudy skies and iffy weather so we slowly paddled toward the portage into Burnt Island Lake , anticipating paddling part way down the lake and camping near Caroline Island where we thought we 'd find some nice campsites . The portage was uneventful but seeing the waters of Burnt Island Lake was exciting . The last of the " real " portages was over however the wind was up so crossing Burnt Island would be work . We stayed towards the Northwest shore , aiming at the point as we crossed the first bay . We paddled across the next bay in similar fashion as we approached the mid-section of the lake . While some of our party had paddled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake , none of us had been at this end of the lake so we were relying on descriptions of the campsites provided by others . The sites opposite Caroline Island were occupied so we continued down the shoreline and made our way back into a small bay where we found a large , flat site about 5 feet up an embankment . The site turned out to be an excellent location for our last night as we had plenty of space for the tents and fly , as well as hammock trees and reading spots . However , the breeze was so strong that anyone trying to enjoy the spot ended up sitting behind a tree , under the Buckley shelter or in one of the tents . By now , we had come to expect this type of weather and made the most of it . Around 7 PM a solo paddler came by asking if we had seen Mark . It turned out that his companion had gotten bored , walked off for a " two hour hike " and was still missing after 5 hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next campsite and blew our whistles into the face of the still-strong wind . We resisted the urge to go searching in the darkness but two of our group who had previously hiked across the peninsula behind our site took lights and walked over the trail . We had decided to get up and check in the morning to see if the paddler was still missing . If so , we 'd paddle out at least as far as Arowhon Pines Lodge and attempt to make contact with the park staff . A leadership group from a summer camp was going to leave early in the morning and paddle out to Canoe Lake and report the missing person . <p> Day Eight : <p> Night Eight Outfitters <p> As Friday morning dawned , two members of our group paddled off to check on the situation and while the rest of us boiled water and prepared for either a quick departure or breakfast we were surprised by the appearance of a fellow who walked out of the woods . We greeted him with the statement , " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp , gotten lost , found a campsite and tried yelling at some folks at another site but apparently they either did not understand his call for help in the strong winds or were afraid of leaving their site . Mark put one of his jackets on backwards to afford some protection for his face from the bugs and hunkered down until morning . He stated that he had been walking for 2 hours when he came out of the woods at our site . We gave him some beef jerky and water then paddled him over to his camp site . Soon we were packing up to leave and begin paddling towards the Southern end of Burnt Island Lake . I continue to a chuckle at the wooden construction at the portage into Baby Joe Lake . The original rocky landing on the Burnt Island side would be sufficient and the timber " wading pool " seems to be out of place . The portage 's other end , with its large stairway , seems to be a more overkill than usefulness . If either of these structures were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of their craft and make it across the trail without difficulties . The next carry can be shortened from its posted 435 meters but during low water it is faster to walk the whole trail . We reentered the creek at the second put in on the edge of Lost Joe Lake and made it through to the marked put in downstream but it was not a time saver . While fun navigating through the deadfall the water level was insufficient to make it a wise choice . At the portage prior to entering Little Joe Lake the trail goes both ways so make certain that you head in the correct direction . This is a short carry and a beautiful spot but watch the muddy landing as you get out at the upstream end . The bottom drops off quickly about 3 feet from shore . From here on to Canoe Lake , depending upon season and day of week , expect to encounter many others . Little Joe , Joe and Canoe Lakes were crowded with paddlers looking for an overnight spot and we were lucky to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of our trip . We decided to paddle straight out to Canoe Lake and call the shuttle even though we were tempted to find a location away from the crowds by diverting up into Tom Thomson or Littledoe . We successfully navigated the last portage into Canoe Lake without losing any of our gear to the scores of others crisscrossing the path . Four members of our party had not been to the Tom Thomson Cairn so we headed over that way , tied up our canoes at the small dock and scrambled to the top . The view from the top of the hill is quite nice and provides a good perspective of Canoe Lake . However , upon descending the hill we found that the camp group behind us had tied their canoes up in such a way that ours were blocked in and we had to carefully navigate ropes and boats in the strong wind to extricate our canoes . Upon arriving at the shore of Canoe Lake we began the process of acclimatizing to life off the water . We eased the process a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outfitters to arrive and since we were ahead of schedule , we had sufficient time to eat the pitas , clean up the zip loc bags of junk and relax a bit . Of course , Horse and a few others took advantage of the ice cream on sale at the Portage Store . Some traditions are hard to break . <p> River Travel : beginner Lake Travel : intermediate ( wind on large lakes ) Portaging : easy to moderate with no " killers " Remoteness : mixed with Burntroot Lake very good while the closer to Canoe Lake you get , well , what can one say ?

After that time , water levels make the trip a hike , not a paddle . However , runoffs are not always normal and local weather patterns can extend or reduce this window dramatically . Water levels are not monitored , so there is no way of knowing . Because the Pukaskwa runs through a bedrock channel with no soil mass to buffer rainfall , it is very sensitive to precipitation - a rainstorm can change the nature of the river overnight . By late May , most ( but not all ) of the rapids on the route are class 1 or 2 . This river demands scouting and whitewater paddling skills - definitely not for novices .

The weather was partially cloudy with temperatures hovering around 23 degrees . Everyone was immediately overwhelmed by the serene tranquility of the lake and the surroundings of the lodge . I quickly handled all administrative details concerning our first evening and our transport to Cartier train station the next morning . After an enjoyable dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spry for our adventure awaiting us . <p> Day 1 We arrived at the train station at 0945 hrs and systematically arranged our gear and canoes for the pick-up . We anxiously awaited the arrival of the " Budcar " which arrived fashionably late at 1040 hrs ( 40 minutes late ) . <p> Space was tight due to a last minute booking by a group going to their cottage with a 14 ft fishing boat but after 25 min all was loaded and we were on our way . The trip was scenic and the weather was a carbon copy of the previous day . Our first view of the Spanish River revealed extremely low water conditions and we all wondered if we would be doing more walking than canoeing . 45 minutes later we arrived at the " Forks " . Along with the cottagers we unloaded with no problems . A few steps to the southeast revealed a small path , which leads down to the riverbank . We were relieved to see that here the water levels were fairly high . Within 20 minutes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work . <p> After 30 minutes on the river we stopped for lunch on the island at the actual fork in the river . ( GR 352093 ) . We were back on the water by 1300 hrs and so far the bugs were not too bad . After 1 hour we came to the first marked portage ( actually the only sign we ever saw ) at GR 378064 . The water was low enough here that a portage was not required . I decided to take a look at the portage for future trips and discovered a beautiful camp sight half way through the portage . Since our trip was only going to be 45 km over 3 days we decided to enjoy the rest of our first day at this camp site . I decided to spend an hour fly fishing while others read , walked or just relaxed . No luck ( probably because of the warm water due to the low levels ) . Normally , I am told the trout are abundant in the Spanish . <p> Unfortunately due to a fire ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugs were still very manageable and disappeared around 2000 hrs when it became a little cooler . We all went to bed at 1000 hrs . <p> Day 2 <p> Rise and shine at 0730 hrs to a crisp clear sunny morning . By 1000 hrs we hit the water . Water levels varied but we were always able to pick good routes through the rapids with minimal rock contact . An ABS canoe is definitely recommended for these types of water levels . At noon we found a nice sand bar an enjoyed a nice lunch with temperatures around 27 degrees . We stopped at the Pogamasing river junction just after lunch and viewed the chute apparently used by loggers for a long time . We noticed some cloud development just after lunch and realized we would soon be wet campers . Mother Nature was gentle bringing only 30 minutes of rain . Unfortunately it happened right when we were experiencing the lowest levels on the trip . ( GR 419915 ) . We pushed on for about an other 1.5 hrs ( we missed 3 of the 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up at a great spot below a high ridge ( GR 436853 ) . This one was not marked the map but was marked by a sign . We settled in and about 6 of our group did some rappelling and top roping just north of our site on the east shore . Although we had some rain we still did not take a chance building a fire even tough we were tempted . Still no fish . <p> Day 3 The day dawned with clear skies and still conditions . We packed up and were on our way by 0930 hrs . The winds started picking up and we soon started bucking a strong headwind , however the stronger currents at this part of the river helped us maintain a speed of around 5 km/hr . The river was quite shallow from here to Spanish Lake with lots of class I rapids ( some bordering on class II ) . I 'm sure with higher levels this would be a very challenging stretch of water . The campsite marked on the MNR map at GR 449800 is co-located with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy winds , very choppy . We planned to stay overnight at the campsite marked on the MNR map at GR 454668 but never did find it . The river has high banks from the Spanish River to the " Elbow " . We ended up at the " Elbow " at 1400 Hrs . We surveyed the campsite here , a large open field , and decided we would rather head back to the lodge and spend our last night there . <p> Conclusion Although the river level was low and a fire ban was in effect we all learned a great deal and enjoyed ourselves .

We spent a glorious 9 days on the river . We started our trip at Sinker Creek on the west branch . You take the Bud car to Sinker Creek and begin your trip . I would highly recommend this trip to all with some white water experience . For an adventurous family it is a great trip . It is worthwhile to limit your daily length of paddling to about 10 km. max . We have three canoes , of which one is a kevlar canoe . I was able to run most of the rapids solo with a nine year old in the front ( for weight ) . The sites are beautiful and the river has a wide variety of different paddling features . I suggest that you purchase the Chrismar map of the Spanish River , an excelent map .

Lawrence Lowlands . The " Skoot " from Skootamatta Lake ( just south of Bon Echo ) to Tweed is 55km long and can be done in two long days of canoeing . This river is definitely a " before Victoria Day River " . The river is quite small at its Northern end and I can not imagine canoeing it with water levels being a few inches lower . This is not the route for those looking for a leisurely weekend paddle . There are numerous rapids as the river makes its way off the shield and portage trails are almost non-existent in the northern section of the river . In addition there are numerous blow-downs to further impede your progress down the river . 134045 @qwx994045 <p> The lack of cleared portage trails and some steep hills makes portaging difficult at times . 134054 @qwx994054 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toronto at 0620 and were on the water by 1000 . The topo map came in handy while navigating our way to the put-in . ( Basically take 41 North of Cloyne left on Skottamatta Lake Rd then Left on Sheldrake Lake road . ) We paddled a few kilometres south on Skootamatta Lake portaged around the dam . Soon after we had to do a lift-over around a small set of rapids that were impassable due to a blow-down . At the power lines there are swifts that can be easily navigate/bumped over . Following this there are numerous beaver dams that we simply canoed over as there was enough water flowing over them . At Slave Lake portage around the remains of an old logging dam on the left . After the dam there is another portage around a chute at a bridge . After this portage the river meanders for about five kilometres . The brochure for this route says that falling trees make canoeing very difficult in this section . I guess it was a matter of how much effort you are willing to put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strainers but the water levels were high enough to allow us to find a way around or over the trees , some times we would have to do a lift over , but I would not say this section is impassable . <p> We had lunch in a clearing at another small set that had to be portaged and then continued to paddle on a slow part of the river that meandered quite a bit again . On the approach to the village of Flinton there is a nice set of rapids that , depending on your experience can be run ( CBR ) . <p> In Flinton it appeared that there was a recent fire that gutted a house near the river , the fire trucks were still on the scene when we paddled through . We believe it may have been the store ; we also walked around the village looking for a place to get a snack but could not find a store . At Flinton , portage around the dam at the park on the left . <p> Just downriver of Flinton there is a chute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CBR ) <p> Just past a bridge begins a long set of rapids with numerous ledges . The brochure for this route suggests that this kilometre set of rapids can be run by whitewater experts . We opted for the " portage trail " as I could not locate any good places to eddy and trying to lift over the canoe around ledges would have been more of an effort than portaging . At the beginning of this set on the left hand side there is an excellent campsite where we spent the night . <p> Day 2 We started the day portaging around the aforementioned long set of rapids . I believe we ran the next set . Soon after the river begins to meander again complete with beaver dams and fallen trees . For the next fifteen kilometres or so ( until the river comes close to Hwy.7 ) there are numerous rapids and falls . We used are own initiative when we approached an obstacle since the portage trails that the brochure describes seemed to be very difficult to find or non-existent . To this end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landings to portages are not always evident . We managed to shoot about half a dozen sets often in combination with lift-overs on this day . One set we ran while a nearby homeowner watched . He then came and talked to us and told us that he typically sees about five canoes a year . This , in addition to the leaves leftover from autumn in our fire pit at the campsite , led me to believe that we were probably the only party to canoe the entire length of this route this year . <p> The river then parallels highway seven for about ten kilometres . The conditions here are slow . At the end of this section our paddling was rewarded by the impressive High Falls . You must portage on the right side ; from a distance it appears that one of the landings is very close ( half a a canoe length ) to the lip of the falls so we found a safer one about five metres back . <p> There is another two-kilometre flatwater paddle to reach the Actinolite dam . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recommend terminating your trip here . We arrived here at 6:30pm but continued on to Tweed . The Actinolite to Tweed section was interrupted by one portage early on ; most of it was flat water paddling interspersed with a few areas of swifts . The natural scenery in this part is n't exactly awe inspiring , however upon our arrival in Tweed at 8:00pm we could say that we paddled the entire length of the Skoot and rewarded ourselves with some Tim Hortons . <p> All in all the Skoot is quite an intense weekend trip that is fairly remote considering its distance from major population centres .

@@107413477 @2813477/ <p> Therefore , in theory , it does n't matter if it 's a canoe or a kayak , the longer waterline is faster . The differences are in how easy is it to achieve or maintain hull speed . Also , how much effort is required to maintain a speed that is only a portion of hull speed . <p> The above information is taken directly from a newspost , no name given . <p> My question is which would be the faster , a shorter ( i.e. 16 ' ) or a longer ( 17 ' + ) canoe ? Which is easier to maintain hull speed if the total weight of the cargo is the same ? This brings me to another question , is the paddle shape more influencial than hull shape on overall canoe speed ? Of course everyone knows that the paddlers is the overwhelming determinant of overall speed but I 'm curious about the influence of canoe length and paddle shapes . <p> The length determines the " hull speed , " that is the speed at which the bow and stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the maximum speed at which the boat can readily travel without plaining . In cases where the wetted portion of the hull is vary narrow -- in a multihull sailing vessel , for example - the bow and stern waves are small enough not to be a major factor . Hence they can exceed the hull speed as determined by the formula you stated . <p> The length has little to do with how easy it is to achieve a given speed below hull speed . Here other factors are more imprtant . These include the waterline beam ( the narrower the faster ) , rocker ( the less the faster ) the underwater shapes of the bow and the stern and a number of other things . <p> Stars from horizon to horizonA whole half universeJust to light a path <p> Paddle shapes : look at the shape used by marathoners ( a modified Sugar Island style , fatter on the bottom ) ... its faster . Its also more susceptible to transmission of turning forces . If you do n't  have a stroke that is parallel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning and tacking is n't the fastest way to go . <p> Look up prismatic coefficient . Influences hull speed . And length to width ratio of the hull . I do n't  worry too much about speed , a good cruising pace for me alone is 5 km an hour ; faster is too tiring no matter what the boat . So I get by fine in a 15 foot boat . My partner and I have good technique with less than three degrees yaw and we can easily outrun others in our group with bigger boats with our 15 foot thirty six inch beam bathtub . <p> First just a cautionary note when discussing this subject . When people use the term " fast " , they often mean the practical maximum speed or hull speed or they mean efficiency . These are two very different concepts that should be understood by every paddler . Why do n't we agree to use the terminology of boat designers so that " fast " means hull speed or the practical maximum speed due to wave making and " efficiency " means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With two boats of otherwise the same shape ( prismatic or longitudinal coeffcient , etc ) the longer boat will require more effort to paddle at its hull speed ( theoretical maximum due to wave making resistance ) because it has greater frictional resistance due to a greater wetted surface area . So the longer boat is " faster " but the shorter boat is more " efficient " , ie , gives more speed with the same effort at normal cruising speeds . Hull speed is not achieved for long periods except by very fit and motivated people so the concept of efficiency is more relevant for most paddling . <p> With two boats of equal overall length and shape but with different degrees of rocker , the boat with less rocker is " faster " , ie , has a greater hull speed , only because its waterline length is greater . But the boat with more rocker has less " deadwood " in the water making for reduced frictional resistance . Therefore the boat with more rocker is more efficient . There is a popular myth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having higher hull speeds for a given overall length but this is simply not true . While the straight keeled boat may " track " easier especially for folks whose paddling skills are less developed , there is a penalty to pay for the extra wetted surface area in terms of efficiency . <p> The key point is : do n't get too caught up in looking for a boat with the greatest hull speed because , unless you are racing , you may be buying a less efficient boat . And even if you like to paddle hard , do the math and you will find that a difference of 6 " or a foot will make relatively little difference in what time you get to camp . By far the greatest gains in travelling speed and reduction of effort can be made by packing light , keeping a tidy boat and single carrying the portages . In a race across Algonquin Park , an ordinary paddler in a 15 ' solo boat who single carries the portages would smoke a tandem pair of Olympic paddlers in a 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries with a lot of heavy gear . Just thought you would want to know that . Jay <p> It 's worth pointing out that the theory assumes flat , calm water . Throw in a little wave action and things change . Different above water shapes can have a significant impact on performance if you 're compare two canoes with very similar below waterline shapes . <p> With two boats of otherwise the same shape ( prismatic or longitudinal coeffcient , etc ) the longer boat will require more effort to paddle at its hull speed ( theoretical maximum due to wave making resistance ) because it has greater frictional resistance due to a greater wetted surface area . <p> A longer canoe should ride higher in the water . Resistence and drag are also dependant on the amount of frontal area that is being pushed throught the water . So if you 're canoe is 35 inches wide at the water line , and it is sitting 3 " deep in the water you have a three by 35 frontal projection . Say you have a shorter boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 inch frontal projection under the water line . That 's is more water to push . On the longer boat that frontal projection is spread over a longer area , making for less friction at each point on the water line . It seems to me that somewhere I read that that makes a difference . Those two reasons were in my understanding why a longer boat was faster . Does anyone have any empircal data on any of this . Too much theory hurts my head . <p> Norm , I believe that John Winters tells a story of an early racer who , informed about the physics of wave making resistance , opted for a much longer boat ( practically the same weight when considering both boat and paddler ) not appreciating the effect of added frictional resistance . His long boat turned out to be considerably slower . Ca n't recall the lengths involved , but it really does n't matter as this type of boat would not be used for tripping anyhow . <p> For those that do like theory and numbers go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winters ' article on the weight of a cdear strip boat and follow to his page for some fairly obtuse articles on the science of boat design at http : **32;1763;TOOLONG Sorry John , I like your boats but you are not the clearest communicator on the pond . Jay <p> But you do appear to go faster if you solo in a v-hull boat and lean so that only one side of the hull is fully in the water . On another note , natives used the narrowest paddles and still got where they were going just as fast . Wide paddles are overrated for speed . You may " grab " more water but it takes more effort to pull a wide blade through the water than does a narrow one . Just my two coppers ' worth <p> Hull Speed by the way is that speed where the stern sinks into the null or troth of the bow generated wave and is not influenced by friction drag . Two boats of equal waterline length can have different hull speeds as the term that multiplies square root of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boat . In other words , it 's not always 1.34 . So a boat that is very sleek ( sailboats can be up around 1.5 I believe ) will have a higher hull speed than a more chunky boat . However , the more chunky boat will likely have less wetted area and thus less friction drag so it will be easier to paddle at cruising speed . <p> I doubt that even racers get their boats all that close to hull speed . In other words , no one " maintains hull speed " as it takes too much horsepower . We all paddle well below hull speed . The only time I experience hull speed is on my power boat just before it gets up on a plane . <p> Assuming both the 16 ' and the 17 ' had the same hull fairness ( i.e. , both were 1.34 or some other value ) , the 17 ' would be superior with gear . First , it would sink less than the 16 ' , so it would suffer less increase in both submerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would likely have no more friction drag when loaded than the 16 ' ( possibly less ? ) and it would have less wave making drag to begin with . <p> I 've personally experienced the difference between a 16 ' 4 " MR Kevlar Explorer and a 17 ' 2 " Kevlar Canadienne with the same weight of gear and people . In this case the hull fairness was far different as the Explorer had a capacity of 1100 lbs with 6 " freeboard and the Canadienne has 964 lbs . They both measured nearly 15 " deep as they had wood gunnels . Right away you can visualize which boat is sleeker underwater . <p> The Explorer will draw less water than the Canadienne with gear . But those full ends , required to achieve that 1100 lb capacity in a short hull , really slow you down . This is an example where a shorter , fuller boat while it will ( likely ) have less wetted area , has such a chunky shape it 's slow . The fairness of the hull counts too : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A lot depends on hull shape , how much gear you carry and how strong the paddlers . I 'd always go for the 17 ' unless I needed the maneuverability of a shorter boat . <p> As Rolf mentioned , it 's more than just flat water performance that counts . The Explorer would pound in big waves off the bow whether loaded or not . That really slows the boat . The full ends , the reason for the pounding , also slowed the boat in waves that did not induce pounding . The Canadienne just slices through waves ( and never pounds ) with little slowing of the boat . We were wind bound in Quetico once with the Explorer . I doubt that would happen with the Canadienne . <p> If you are looking for a fast boat , you have two options IMO . One is to paddle ( with gear ) some candidates and measure the speeds with a GPS that you and your partner are able to generate . The second is to buy a boat that has a reputation for speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jensen 18 ' or the Bell North Woods 18 ' 6 " . I prefer the North Woods . It 's much faster than my Canadienne which is no slouch . It 's also a tripping boat ( 6 " @ 1200 lbs ) . Then there 's the Bell Mystic 18 ' 6 " which should really fly as it 's 6 " @ 970 lbs . It 's not hard to figure which , between the Mystic and the North Woods , will have the fairer hull . <p> Yes . paddle shape matters . We see a 0.5 mph increase in speed with our 14-degree paddles over our 10-degree paddles over a two hour period measure by a passenger with a GPS in the Canadienne . The paddle shapes are very different . So are the blade and shaft flex . <p> Al , it is not quite correct to say that two boats of equal waterline length can have different hull speeds depending on the " fairness " of the boats . First , " fairness " is a builder 's term referring to the smoothness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fineness " or the coefficient of longitutude or prismatic coefficient or possibly the displacement to length ratio . Second , the waves created by the boat will travel at 1.34 knot x square root of the waterline length , regardless of the boat 's shape . But as you pointed out , fine boats may be paddled , with enough power , at greater than their hull speed . However , the boat 's hull speed is still defined by 1.34 , etc , not what it is actually capable of doing . <p> You pointed out that we normally paddle at significantly less than hull speed . That true of course and that 's why I mentioned to Norm only that the drag due to frictional resistance varies with the square of velocity ; the difference in wavemaking resistance at typical cruising speed is n't very significant . <p> You also doubted that canoes can be paddled at hull speed , even by racers . The hull speed of a 17 ' waterline boat is about 10.3 kph . Marathon racers normally do in fact maintain thses speeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But all this discusion of hull speed and length is largely irrelevant if not downright confusing for the average canoe tripper . He wants to know , " Should I buy a 16 ' boat or a 17 ' boat with the same shape ? " The answer will have almost nothing to do with hull speed ( the difference is 10.3 -10.0 = 0.3 kph , significant in a race but meaningless when paddling at 5 kph ) . No , it will have to do with his cargo load , and need for stability and seaworthiness . He should also remember that the 17 ' boat , all other things being equal , is going to require more effort to paddle at a given cruising speed , so the extra length is not a free benefit on the water , to say nothing of having to carry a few more lbs over the portages . Jay <p> I paddled none of them first , Normhead . The Jensen was paddled by a couple that we tripped with in Quetico The guy was stronger than me ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible paddler . In a strong tail wind they hardly had to paddle and we struggled to keep up in a 16 ' 4 " ME Kevlar Explorer . By the way , the 16 ' ABS Explorer is even slower . <p> We also encountered the Bell North Woods in Quetico . We both left camp at the same time . Again , the stern guy had a better stroke then me ( I 've worked on that ) , his wife was not nearly as good a paddler as mine and they were lightly loaded ( 5 day trip for them and 18 for us ) . We pulled ahead of them as we were better at tracking and portaging , but they caught us on a big lake and disappeared over the horizon . We were in our Canadienne 17 . <p> Now in fairness to the Canadienne , we were heavier then they were ( people and gear ) and out boat had much less volume so it squatted down in the water more . That increased our wetted surface area and our submersed frontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMO and that 's in keeping with it 's reputation . <p> If your talking about the Explorer VS Canadienne , there it 's also somewhat subjective as I 've never measured the speed differences with a GPS or paddled them on the same day . However , we were covering greater distances in less time , ( like our training area where we have mile markers ) especially in head winds and/or waves and we pass boats more often . The Canadienne by the way has a bow shape where the cutwater extends out beyond the deck . So the 17 ' 2 " is almost the waterline length . It 's waterline is probably akin more to an 18 ' boat than a 17 ' boat . <p> Jay , I must be using an incorrect term . I 've read too often in the boat literature ( and on sailboat groups of the CCR model ) that the hydrodynamic design of the wetted part will affect that so-called constant and affects the so-called hull speed . However , that does n't make it correct , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see what he says . <p> My proposition though , that different boats of the same length can have different wave making losses and therefore different ( practical ) top speeds is valid either way . A simple example would be a comparison between a square ended canoe and a pointy ended one . Obviously , far more paddling energy goes into making waves from the square-ender . You will actually see bigger waves . <p> I agree people should ignore things like hull speed and wetted area since no one has access to these data for any boat on the market . It 's interesting to discuss for some of us , like politics , history and the environment , but has little practical value . If a boat looks sleek and designed by a guy noted for fast designs ( Jensen , Yost ) , it will be fast . But , it will get that speed at a price that may make it a not very pleasing tripping boat depending on what one wants in a canoe . <p> On the other hand , any canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mohawk would do just fine . We met a guy who was out for over two weeks in Quetico in a Bell Wildfire 14 ' . I felt sorry for him fighting big waves and head winds in that little boat . He was a stocky guy and had two heavy packs . He was very slow in that overloaded boat . But he was strong , having a very good time and not taking on much water that I could see . That couple with the Jensen 18 had to bail sometimes in big waves . Yet they have enjoyed dozens of trips in that boat . They liked the speed . <p> I disagree that the 17 ' will be harder to paddle at lower speed than a 16 ' . First , all things are rarely if ever equal so it 's silly to consider that case and second , 17 ' foot boats are generally have more volume than 16 ' ones and will draw less water with a load than a 16 ' . This , more often than not makes them easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the Explorer and the Canadienne . <p> Al , I could be wrong ( gasp ! ) about strict use of the term " hull speed " , its posible perhaps even likely that in different circles it could be used differently . <p> Anyway I just wanted to comment on the choice of , for example , a 16 ' boat vs a 17 ' version with otherwise the same shape . We had this choice last year in the canoe club in the case of a carbon fibre Souris River Quetico , a much more pleasant choice I 'm sure everyone would agree than between a 16 ' and 17 ' Grumman . Lots of prospector models are available in 16 and 17 foot versions both in flatwaer and in whitewater materials . Also , anyone building a cedar strip canoe has the option of stretching it by placing the station molds further apart by equal amounts , preserving the shape ( and fairness of the curves ) . So the question really is n't all that hypothetical ( I 'm sure you did n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of frictional and residual resistance is that the 17 ' boat identically loaded , is less efficient than the same hull in a 16 ' version , at normal cruising speeds of course , say 6 kph . So we seem to disagree on this if I read you right . I would be interested in putting the question to a boat designer , say John Winters , one of your faves . I think we agree that even if there is an efficiency advantage in favour of either boat , it would be so marginal that other factors would decide the choice .

We figured that this was going to be a 12 hour drive and we wanted to miss some of the Toronto traffic . The going was better than we anticipated as we arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A coffee and muffin later we were on the road . Our next stop was at Espanola for lunch at about 11:30am . <p> We got to Chapleau around 3:30 , had to ask where the road to Missinaibi Park was , and were on our way again . <p> For those of you who follow this route just as you come into Chapleau you 'll be going over a bridge that curves around to the right . When you get across the bridge you need to turn right . Look for the beer store and head for it . The sign for Missinaibi Park is on the beer store and will lead you to the 75km gravel road access to the park . <p> It had n't  rained in a while we guessed as we kicked up a giant plume of gravel dust .

I muttered a few unkind words , hoped that this was the last of the bush cowboys and we continued on . <p> We arrived at Barclay Bay at about 4:30 , found the gatehouse closed but the requirement for camping permits clearly displayed . Let 's see , $6.50 per adult per night times 8 nights . Holy moose dung batman that 's $104 !

I park the truck , hit the washroom and were on our way . <p> Its a hot , still afternoon and we figure that well get as far as Mary Island today . We get as far as the first island campsite ( about 3km ) and decide that we need a swim to cool off . The campsite is occupied by motor boaters so we pull up on the west side of the island and go for a quick swim . <p> We resume paddling and get to Mary Island at about 6:30 ( another 3.5km ) . The campsite is adequate , has a picnic table , room for two or three tents and is soon looking like home . Kathy erects the tent while I modify the fire pit , gather some firewood , start a fire and brew up some of my world famous camp coffee . <p> Dinner is Ramen noodles and dehydrated veggies as the sun is setting and the moon is rising . Its almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water of Barclay Bay . We comment about how it must be a great time to be at Fairy Point but if the weather holds well be there tomorrow evening . <p> We should not have talked in front of the weather gods . <p> Today we covered 7km with no portages . <p> Saturday , August 12 - Day 2 <p> Were up at 7:30 and are greeted by a nice riffle on the water as the prevailing breeze starts from the southwest . Todays goal is to get close enough to Fairy Point so that we can have an early dinner and paddle out to see the pictographs after the breeze dies and as the sun is setting . <p> There are warnings posted at the entrance gate and again at the boat launch area about the wind and how it causes dangerous conditions very quickly in the area of Fairy Point . <p> Were on the water at 10:00 with a decent and growing headwind so we angle for the south shore and try to stay out of the wind . The going is slow as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point exposes us to the full force . We reach Whitefish falls at 12:30 and call a lunch break . We 've only covered about 8km but my shoulders are beginning to tire . We find the pictograph site here but its too exposed to the wind to allow picture taking . There are three fishing boats present and we exchange greetings with one as we make our way to the sand beach on the western shore . Its nice and protected here . I can see why it was a native camp during their fishing forays . The sun is out and its quite pleasant . There are several sets of moose tracks in the sand . We find a nice spot out nearer the point where were out of sight of the fishermen , drag the canoe up on the sand and have our lunch . Its nice here in the sun but we can see the waves passing by and we know that we 've got about another 6km to cover to get to our intended campsite . That will put us within 1.5km of Fairy Point . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down the southern coastline and into a protected bay , which should be across from our campsite . I scan the far shore with my binoculars but can not pick out any campsite marker . It just has to be in that small bay across from us so we start out and set a path just west of where we think the campsite is . All the way across I keep looking for something that will mark the site . We reach the north shore at the point that looked the most promising but there 's no campsite here . We decide to land in a small bay and check out the next point on foot . We ride in on the surf and hastily drag the canoe up on the gravel beach . Thank god for ABS . A walk out to the point proves fruitless but were sure that it must be East of here so we retrace our path back to the canoe , wade into the surf to start and paddle around the point . Another 100m and voila here 's a fireplace on an exposed piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in out of the wind a bit and Kathy goes up the sloping rock to check . The only marker here is a bit of white tape tied around a small tree at the top of the slope but its home ! ! The trip from Whitefish Falls has taken 2.5 hours . A distance that we would have covered in an hour in calm conditions . Theres room for two tents in a nicely protected pocket . Someone has even set up a small fire pit up here which does n't  require much work to house our grill . The site is about 10m above the lake with a sloping rock leading to the water . All in all a pretty good site . The wind is blowing hard enough so that I bring the canoe up to the campsite rather than worrying about a gust of wind leaving us canoeless . Always the optimists we make an early dinner so that well be ready for the evening calm . After dinner were sitting out on the rock in front of the site having a coffee when Kathy says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear was coming down the shore from the west so that it was traveling with the wind . It was about 30m from us and had n't  seen or heard us . A quick blast on my emergency whistle got its attention but it could n't locate the source of the sound . I stood up , waved my arms and shouted at it . Now it saw me and retreated into the bush behind our site never to reappear . My heart stopped pounding but the waves did n't  . No Fairy Point tonight . Today we covered 14.5km with no portages Sunday , August 13 - Day 3 Wind blew all night - its now cloudy . Were up at 7 , have some granola and coffee and a short discussion . Since it does n't  look like well get to Fairy Point today why do n't  we head for Little Missinaibi Lake ? Were on the water by 8:30 and back at Whitefish Falls at 9:15 . What took us 2.5 hours yesterday took us 45 minutes this morning . Now the fun begins . Were planning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1000 , 165 , 400 , 60 , 270 and 1025m . According to Haps book the last is up a killer rock slope to start . There wont be much time on the water between portages . The longest paddle looks like about 1.5km . Well , let 's get to it . The first portage from Whitefish Bay back to the Little Missinaibi River starts out with some uphill stuff with steps built into the slope not too bad then there 's some more uphill before we get to level ground . Its a damp humid morning and now were getting a light shower . I 'm sweating pretty good now and the bugs are beginning to gather . Do n't  they know that its August 13 and that they 're supposed to be gone by now ? The portage passes through a burned over area and there appears to be lots of blueberries available . A downhill section marks the end of the portage . The shower has stopped . The sweating has n't  .

It makes little difference to me , as I have n't begun to dry out yet . On the next portage , a 400m on the right we carry our first load and decide to have lunch before the second load . As we begin the second trip we encounter a party from Pennsylvania that is on their way out . There are six of them and we stop to chat at our put in point . They report that the portage into Trump is blocked in one place and that the dreaded rock face is quite slippery . They also report that the passage from Elbow to Little Miss is open save for three beaver dams . We part company and the next obstacle is in sight . The reported 60m portage on the right . We look at the CI and decide to try to paddle up it . No such luck . Our paddling speed matches the speed of the current but no more . We drift back and resort to lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another kilometer brings us to a 270m portage on the left . No big deal here . As we drop down to the river Kathy stops , turns around and says " Theres a moose in the river " . Sure enough , there 's a cow moose about 100m upstream of us . Of course the camera is on the other end of the portage . I walk down to the river and gently deposit the canoe , help Kathy off with her load and we decide to head back rather than staying to watch Ms. Moose who is feeding and seems not to care that were there . By the time we get back the sun is out and she 's even closer to the landing . We deposit our loads and get out the camera gear . We spend the next 15 minutes taking pictures .

Moose picture We load up and paddle by . Shes standing just back from the water watching us go by . The river is now quite shallow and we scrape bottom a few times as we work our way to the dreaded Trump Lake portage . The landing is on the right and there 's a decent campsite here . As we unload we look for the reported rock face but can not see it . However , 50m up the trail it begins . Fortunately for us it has dried out and is not slippery . But it is a steep climb for about 50m . As you reach the top there 's a nice big boulder to rest your pack on while you get your breath . Only another 975m to go . There is a blow down which blocks the trail but a fairly easy bypass is available through the brush on the right . By the time we get our gear to Trump Lake I 'm bushed . Weve done 2860m of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying $6.50 a night for this ? From the portage we can see that the campsite on the larger island is occupied . We paddle over to ask if the other island is also occupied . " No " , they reply in an Ohio twang . " Where you folks headed " ? When we report that were going to Lil Miss they suggest that the water is too low and volunteer that they 're leaving sometime tomorrow if we want their campsite . We continue down the lake with a good stiff tailwind to the campsite Hap records as the preferred site . It is a fairly level site and has been manicured with a chainsaw . Its too open for our liking . There are two upturned boats present and the huge fire pit is right out in the wind . We find a semi-protected place to put the tent . I find an old fire ring and carry some rocks to rebuild it and we move in for the night . After a dinner of bulgar and curried lentils which was preceded by gallons of water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel a little less stiff . There was a spectacular sunset that afforded some good pictures . Sunset picture Today we covered 13km with 2950m of portages . <p> Monday , August 14 - Day 4 Were up at 7:30 but the wind is n't . Could it be that well have a calm day ? After a breakfast of twelve-grain cereal with cranberries , brown sugar and milk ; along with coffee of course , were ready to tackle todays adventure . On the water at 9:15 . Its a short paddle to the portage to Elbow Lake and we arrive to find a soggy and muddy takeout that ca n't be avoided . Rather than following our usual portaging plan we leave some gear in the canoe and carry the packs first . The portage is an easy 220 meters . We enter Elbow Lake and soon spot two motorboats . This means that the path to lil Miss must be open because there are no camps on Elbow Lake . The 4.5km paddle around the elbow passes quite quickly and we approach the marsh at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furthest the lake extends into the marsh and the outlet appears . The stream has no flow and is about 3m wide . It twists and turns through a huge beaver meadow and finally we encounter the first beaver dam . We slide the canoe over and continue on . This is repeated twice and now the water level is very low but just ahead we can see Little Missinaibi . The upper portion of Lil Miss is very marshy . We were told that there were two good campsites at the narrows as you enter the main lake . We think that these are too far from the center of the lake so we pass them and continue on . We take the arm of the lake which is to our left since that is where all the pictographs are and also where Hap has indicated several campsites . Its now lunch time so we pick a nice shady point and pull up for our salami and cheese on a pita accompanied by some juice . There is almost no breeze , the sky is clear and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to hug the right shore to look for the Pothole pictographs . You could n't miss them if you tried . The canoe easily fits into the pothole and we get lots of pictures . Pothole pictographs Crossing the lake here we proceed to the next pictograph site which we find without a problem . However , by now were both hot and tired so we decide to search out a campsite . Hap has indicated that there are three in this vicinity . We want to be further down the lake so we decide to forgo the picture taking until tomorrow , get camped for today and wash off some of the accumulated dirt and sweat . The campsite in the narrows just south of the island in front of us will put us within easy paddling distance of everywhere we want to go so we set out for there . After two trips down that channel and a couple of exploratory trips on foot we decide that the site must have disappeared in last years windstorm . Oh well , there 's another shown just south of pictograph site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the bay and work our way north along the shoreline . We find two places that may have been campsites . One suffers from multiple blowdowns and will require a couple of hours to clear . The second is very small and will require some brush clearing . Its also buggy here so we decide to move on . By now were running out of time so we head for the island west of pictograph site A once again retracing our path . Fortunately there is a campsite here and although there have been several blowdowns someone has been busy with a chainsaw . There is a big tree down over the site at one point but it is just less than head high and has been trimmed . This is a nice site as it will get the sunset and the prevailing breeze . There is a gently sloping rock entrance to the site , which seems to drop off nicely for swimming . We hustle to get set up so that we can get in that swim and bath . The water is refreshing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The water is quite brown and you will not see the rocks that lurk about a meter below the surface . After our swim and bath we consult the menu list and decide to have noodles and pesto sauce . I did n't  even spill any noodles in the straining process . After dinner and tea and cookies the breeze begins to freshen slightly . As I 've left the canoe in an exposed place I bring it up to the site just in case . We retire and plan to visit the rest of the pictograph sites tomorrow . Well pack a lunch and make a day of it . We should know enough not to plan in front of the wind gods . Today we covered 23km with 220m of portage . <p> Tuesday , August 15 - Day 5 During the night we can hear the wind rising and I take the opportunity to check the canoe while I 'm up at one point . Morning finds the wind howling out of the west and just pounding into our little island . Since the pictographs we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our gently sloping entrance we decide to wait and see what the day will bring . We 've had two fairly long days so maybe a little rest is in order . We take our little stove and head for the lee side of the island for breakfast . Coffee and twelve grain cereal with nuts and cranberries really hits the spot . We decide that some reading and laundry is in order so we retrieve our books , get caught up on the journal , and wash out those grimy shorts and shirts of the last two days . The sun is out so the stuff will dry fairly quickly if we can keep it from blowing away . I try a couple of different spots for reading and after a couple of hours I drift into the tent not knowing whether I want to read or nap . Kathy comes running up to the tent just as Im about to drift off and announces that " Theres a moose out in the water down by that little island down in the bay come see . " She begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowdown that I said was just less than head high ? Kathy will always remember it . In her haste to show me the moose she did n't  duck quite far enough . Its a good thing that the moose was up wind of us or shed have heard the thump of noggin on tree . The result was a one-inch cut in Kathys scalp . It did n't  bleed very much so we dried it a bit and dosed it with Polysporin . Now we could turn our attention to the moose . She was a nice sized cow about 600 meters from our camp . She stayed out in the water for over an hour wandering from here to there and doing what moose do best in the summer eat . I commented that it was a little unusual to see a cow at this time of the year without a calf but that this was our second such sighting . Maybe the calves were both hidden while mom replenished her milk supply . She finally left the bay , returning to the shore she entered from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the excitement almost caused us to miss lunch not . Our usual pita with salami , cheese and cucumber really hit the spot . Kathy washed down a couple of aspirin with her helping of juice and since the wind had not abated we went back to reading . I found a spot out of the wind and in the sun where I could lean back and be comfortable but it did n't  last long . Kathy has spotted a cow and calf in the shallows about 400 meters south of us . The cow wades out chest deep and begins to browse . The calf attempts to follow but its too deep to stand so it retreats to shallower water . Once again were treated to about half an hours worth of moose watching . The cow continues to browse while the calf moves very little and seems not at all interested in the water plants . The cow decides that shes had her fill and wanders back to the shallows and heads south along the shore with calf in tow . They reach a sand spit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The calf first pauses on the spit and then turns to move along the spit instead of following mom . At this point the calf begins something I 've never seen it starts to frolic along the spit . Its trotting , jumping and kicking up its heels in general just having some moose fun I guess . Mom returns just enough so that we can see her head and shoulders . To bad we could n't hear the conversation . The frolic continues for about 2 minutes and then the calf rejoins the cow and they disappear around the shore . Were wishing we had a video camera with a 1000mm lens . We decide to have an early dinner so that if the wind dies well be able to get out to photograph pictograph sites C and E from Haps book . The wind shows no sign of abating so once again we take the stove and ingredients to the east side of the island to prepare our meal . Todays delicacy is vegetarian chili . We started soaking the beans this morning so they 're beginning to get tender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can of mixed beans and using our dehydrator . This saves a lot of soaking and cooking time . With dinner , tea and cookies out of the way and the dishes cleaned up we begin to wait for the evening calm . It never comes . Dusk and the mosquitoes do they 're not bad though so we sit out for a bit and consider our plans for tomorrow . Since itll take us a day and a half to get back to Missinaibi Lake and since we really want to see Fairy point we figure that we need to leave here by noon tomorrow . Thatll get us to Missinaibi Lake on Thursday afternoon and give us Thursday evening , all day Friday and Saturday morning to get out to see Fairy Point . We decide to get up early and attempt to do our photographic best and then return to the campsite to pack-up and hit the trail to Missinaibi Lake . Today we covered 0km <p> Wednesday , August 16 - Day 6 There are some overnight showers but the wind is still blowing . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our breakfast and see if we cant get to site E. There is a chance that its out of the wind . From our site we can see pictograph site C and its too rough to attempt pictures there . We leave the site with no problem since the wind has died a little . Crossing the open water to the south of our camp and making our way to pictograph site E is no problem . We find the site and I spend 20 minutes taking pictures . The wind is rising again so we decide to paddle along the lee of the island the pictographs are on and up through a narrow channel to get to site C. We round the island to the sight of whitecaps and they 're all marching straight towards us . Fifty meters more and were out in the full force of the wind . Kathy turns and says , " Theres no way were paddling in this . I 'm not risking my life for some pictures " . It is a foolhardy venture so we retrace our path around the island and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that we can get some protection from the wind which is now blowing in gusts from the north . We get to the north shore and work our way along to a point where we have to expose ourselves to the brunt of the wind again but the wind is continuing to shift and now its coming from the northeast . This means that site C which is just across the lake from us now and only about a half kilometer away will be in the lee for a little while . We struggle across the distance and as we approach the pictographs we find ourselves in the lee of the wind . The pictographs are such that I can get some pictures from the rocks so we pull up and Kathy holds the canoe while I clamber out to get the required pictures . The wind god has given us some respite but we know that its only temporary so we head back to the campsite to pack up and begin our journey back to Missinaibi Lake . We have n't accomplished a quarter of the things we wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point we got ta go . We promise well be back after I retire so that we can spend about three weeks in the area . That way well be able to see and do all the things we would like to . As we pack up the wind settles into a steady force from the northeast with accompanying gusts . My cheery " pack up all your cares and woes " gets swept away in the wind . This is going to make it a long day . We decide to make todays destination the campsite at the end of the portage from Trump Lake to the Little Missinaibi River . By hugging the north shore we can get about 2 km of relatively easy paddling before turning into the brunt of the wind . We stop at the pothole pictograph site once again to admire the ancient art . If only we could understand the message in these paintings . Rounding the curve that heads to the northern reaches of the lake presents us with the problem of which shore to hug in attempt to lessen the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore but this is pretty flat terrain and does n't  offer much of a buffer . Besides , the lake is narrow here and the wind just seems to funnel down any opening . We work our way back past the fly-in camp and the campsites at the entrance to the lake . There are two tents on the western site but we see no inhabitants . The next 1.5 km to the Elbow lake creek seems to take forever . The gusts of wind literally bring us to a standstill . We finally reach the creek and revel in the fact that now we get to paddle through a couple of hundred meters of muck to reach that first beaver dam . The water seems lower than it was when we were through here just two days ago but were out of the wind for now and the winding course is a pleasure . Elbow Lake offers some protection along its northern shore for the first 3.5 km and we decide to stop for lunch as we round the bend and head into the wind for the 1.5 km @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock face that is out of the wind and in the sun and spend about an hour dawdling over lunch and lots of juice . We know that from here to the Trump Lake portage to the river will be into the wind and sure enough it is . The 220m portage from Elbow Lake to Trump Lake is a relative pleasure , even the muddy put-in . We just carry the canoe over first so that we can load it directly . The 3.5km paddle across Trump Lake is not as bad as we thought it would be . We tried to seek the shelter of the islands where we could and actually looked forward to the 1025m portage that followed . The portage went quickly enough , although I struggled harder this time to get around the blowdown . We completed our two trips by about 5:00pm . This is a nice campsite nestled in the woods at the end of a rapid , which does not have enough water in it to run . There is the required sloping rock to the water and a fairly nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be here overnight well just use the stove for dinner . I fire up the stove to make some coffee and help Kathy with the tent since I 'm not gathering any firewood . With the tent up and the coffee ready we sit down to discuss dinner and our plans for tomorrow . Dinner will be Snow Pea Soup with some Babaganoush and Pitas on the side followed by our usual tea and cookies . Over our afternoon whiskey Kathy has only one request " Since I 'm putting up with all this paddling and portaging so that you can get pictures of the pictographs in the area I 'd like to stop on the portage to Missinaibi Lake and pick some blueberries . " I see no problem with that . Itll allow us to have some blueberry pancakes . Today we covered 26km with 1245m of portaging . <p> Thursday , August 17 - Day 7 The day dawns with a coating of fog hanging in the river valley . We take our time about getting out of bed and I decide to use a fire after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail to make our morning coffee . While the waters coming to a boil I just sit down by the river and watch the patterns in the fog as it begins to lift . With coffee made I call Kathy to come-an-git-it . We have granola with juice for breakfast and start the pack up routine . As in the set up routine Kathy handles the in tent stuff and I handle the outside gathering and cleaning up . Were soon ready ; the sun is coming out and by the way , there is no wind . Were on the water for our 1km paddle to the first portage at 9:30 . The 270 meter portage behind us we run the next 60 meter CI , portage 400 meters on the left and approach the next obstacle , a 165 meter rapid that I think might be runnable . We approach the rapid and scout from the water . The flow of water at the top end will carry us to the left through a very narrow chute and into a boulder garden at the bottom . There 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoid the rocks so we decide that perhaps wading will be a good alternative to the carry . Sure enough , we wade the canoe through the top portion and think we see enough of a path so that we can float through the bottom . However , the river and the rocks have another thought and soon were hung up . Oh well , our legs are already wet so a little more water walking wont hurt . Besides , its easier than the portage would have been . Now all we have left is the 1000 meter carry to Missinaibi Lake . We organize our carry so that the food box will go last . Remember , I promised wed stop for blueberries somewhere along the trail . I tell Kathy to be on the lookout for a good picking place as we saddle up for our first trip . The first trip will see me carry the canoe and Kathy will tote one of our barrels . The portage is going nicely , the sun is out but its not too warm . I 'm noticing quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to spot them from underneath a canoe for some reason ) I look up to see where Kathy is but she 's ahead somewhere . A moment later I hear her call out but I cant make out what she said . I figure that she 's commenting about the blueberries and I continue to trudge on thinking that shell be standing in the trail pointing out a good blueberry patch . I do n't  see her until were on our way down the hill into Missinaibi Lake and I do n't  catch up until were on the shore . " What 's up with the yelling " ? I ask between pants for air ( I 'm not as young as I once was and carrying an 80 pound canoe for 1000 meters gets me panting ) . " Oh , just a bear in the blueberry patch " she replies . " I was walking along thinking that we had n't  seen any bear tracks or scat when we came through here before and I thought that was kinda unusual until I looked off to my right and there about 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already seen me so I just yelled at it to scram just like you did with the one the other day " . " Anyway , it beat it back into the bush so let 's get back to our gear before it does " . We retrace our steps , retrieve the rest of our gear and bring it back across the portage to a spot Kathy has picked out for berry picking . We unload , get out a couple of empty jars and start picking . The goal is to gather one jar full between us and not run into Mr. Bruin while were at it . We stay pretty close together and I remind Kathy that she should stand up once in a while and look around . Walking around a little and breaking some brush wont hurt either . It takes us about 45 minutes to get all the berries we want so we finish the portage and put in to make our paddle back out toward Fairy Point . A short visit to the pictographs here in Whitefish Bay is in order so I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get some good shots . The water is almost calm but its getting late if were going to get out to the point so we begin the 5.5 km paddle to the campsite we stayed at earlier in the week . It should put us within good striking distance of the point . ( about 1.5 km ) We talk about going straight to Fairy Point since the weather is so good but as we approach our intended campsite we can see canoes coming from the west and we realize that if we do n't  claim the campsite then our only option will be to camp on Red Granite Point and I do n't  particularly want to be there if the weather turns bad . At least from here we can get out even if the wind howls from the west . With that decided we pull up and claim our campsite . As we finish unloading a group of two canoes approaches and we exchange greetings . They inquire about campsites and we relate that the two we saw further back in the bay were not occupied when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of three canoes passes . " Good thing we got here when we did " I say . I should learn never to say those things in front of the weather gods . The words were hardly out of my mouth when a black cloud rolled in from the west . We could see that it was raining down in South Bay so we quickly erected our tarp and awaited our fate . The shower passed without dampening our spirits . We used the time to make some coffee and plan our dinner . Tonight will be Brown Rice with veggies and hosein sauce . I gather some driftwood and beaver cuttings along the shore for firewood as we wait for the next clear spot to make a dash for the point . There is a clear spot to the west so we quickly grab our stuff , not forgetting the camera or our rainsuits , and head out . We get about half way to the point and there is a shower bearing down on us with no clear spot in sight . We race the shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by much . The clouds seem thicker now and its beginning to look as though well have an early dusk so we decide to have dinner and wait to see what develops . What develops is a cloudy overcast evening with scattered showers . Even between the showers the light is n't what I 'd want for photographs at Fairy Point . Oh well , its only Thursday and we do n't  want to be at the take out point until Saturday at 4 pm . I manage to get a fire started and we start dinner only to finish it on the stove after the next shower drowns the fire . I got ta learn the technique of putting the tarp over the fire pit so that this does n't  happen . It seems that the fire is always just far enough out so that the rain gets it . Oh well , at least I do n't  have any burn marks in the fly yet . Dinner is delicious , we got ta keep this recipe . By the way , Kathy prepared the menu for this trip and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive done most of the planning but since we 've gone to the vegetarian life style shes gotten much more interested in the meal planning aspect of our tripping . She sat up several evenings and weekends trying to figure out how to use the veggies and stuff we dehydrated in our meals . The only hydrated food we brought was the salami , cheese and cucumber for lunch as well as pitas , some rye bread and peanut butter . Oh , we also threw in two tomatoes and were still carrying one of those . The other we ate last night with our babaganoush . The breeze begins to kick up a little from the west but as we sit and have our tea and cookies we hope that it will just move the showers on so that tomorrow will be a clear and sunny day . I move the canoe up to the campsite just as a precautionary measure . I do n't  want to be out there in my gotchies in the middle of the night if a thunderstorm comes up . Today we covered 11km with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day 8 The wind has picked up overnight but we get up early to survey the situation . The wind seems to be out of the northwest and we can see the waves rolling across the end of Barclay Bay through our binoculars . With any luck the wind will switch around and maybe well have a calm stretch so that we can get out to the point . It has n't  blown from the east yet so we almost hope for an east wind , which will put the point in the lee . As the day wears on we get out to try some fishing and twice approach the point only to turn back because of the rough conditions . Our fishing yields the same sad returns . The spare time is used to bathe and shave . Not that we have n't bathed almost daily but tomorrow is getaway day and I want to look presentable when we hit that first Tims . There is still hope for an evening calm , which never comes . But the bear does . It must be the same bear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay from our campsite traveling west . At least this time its traveling away from us . I wonder if it came down the shore toward our camp and detoured around us ? There 's a good chance of that but I shout to get its attention so that it knows were there . It looks in our direction ; I wave my arms and tell it that I 'm much bigger than it is . It looks and then leisurely walks back into the bush . I got ta remember to tell the park people about this bear . There is one last attempt to paddle out to the point as the sun descends but the wind does not abate . Oh well , maybe it was not meant to be . Let 's have some of those blueberries . Kathy sorts and cleans the berries and makes a sauce out of them , which we use over pancakes for dinner . We stuff ourselves and go to bed vowing to try once more in the morning . Today we covered 9km with no portages <p> Saturday , August 19 - Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky was just beginning to turn pink . If we cant get to Fairy Point by noon then were going to have to save it for another time . A check with the binoculars reveals waves marching across the point from the north . The breeze has subsided but it seems to be out of the north now and were in the lee here at our campsite . With coffee made I rouse Kathy and we share the mornings first sips as she looks out over the water and predicts that we will not make it to the point today . I have my doubts but we decide to try again and agree to paddle out to the edge of the point where we had to turn back yesterday . If the waves are bad well just come back . If its rough but manageable well attempt to see the pictographs but not take any pictures . As we paddle out the waves still seem to represent a challenge that we might not want to face . I recall the dire warnings posted at the boat launch about very dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the point and decide that the waves are not so bad that we cant get around to at least see the pictographs . The breeze seems to be shifting around again and now is coming from the northeast as we round the point . Maybe that 's just a deflection off the cliffs here but were now around the point and headed along the cliffs . Were out away from the cliffs so that we can determine if there will be any problem caused by waves reflecting off the cliff face . There are no problems and as we traverse the point the wind seem to be dying . We move in so that were within a few meters of the cliff and begin to look for pictographs . We soon spot those that are highlighted in Haps book . The closer we get to the cliff face the less the breeze effects us and soon Ive got the camera gear out and I 'm snapping away . The light is not great and sometimes I have to use the flash even though I 'm using Fuji 1600 film . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lens on the macro setting so that I can focus down to 19 inches at 300 mm . Fairy Point pictographs In this light and with no one around the setting takes on an eerie feeling . The cliff rises out of the water and I can see where Hap got the feeling and inspiration for the cover of his book . We traverse the rock face slowly in both directions , find a few more pictographs and I succeed in running out of film . Completely out ! I started with six rolls of 24 . Oh well , guess the trip home will not get recorded . The paddle back to our campsite is a silent one as we both wish that our trip was not coming to an end . A week is just not enough to do justice to all there is to see and do . Once we get back and start our real breakfast we begin to consider what we 've seen . Were at once elated that we 've gotten to see the works of the people who inhabited this area thousands of years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We realize that as hunter gatherers we 'd soon starve to death . We recall the presentation we saw at the 2000 Canoe Expo by the couple who tried to live for a year in the wilderness and comment about the amount of work that needs to be done and how it takes family groups or tribes to make the wilderness survivable . After breakfast we slowly pack up our gear and prepare for the paddle back to the Barclay Bay campground . The paddle will take us about four hours so we plan to leave by about noon . The wind is back up now and is gusting from the north-northeast . If we hug the north shore on our way back we should be OK but we can see the waves hitting the south shore . Were soon on our way and within the first two kilometers we experience the force of the wind as we cross an open bay . We have to angle into the wind to prevent ourselves from being swamped or blown out into the center of the channel where we definitely do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marvel at how the wind seems to seek us out . Youd think that with the wind blowing this hard that once in a while wed hit an eddy where the wind was actually at our backs but it does n't  seem to occur . Progress is slow but reasonable as we approach Mary Island . We discuss possible routes and decide to pass behind the island . When we come out the other side the wind should be at our backs . " It should spit us out like a watermelon seed at a summer picnic " . I say as we begin the turn back to the bay . Sure enough , were in the grip of the wind and were really moving now however , I make the error of letting us get too far out into the bay . Now rather than being in the eddy of the wind which was pushing us to the southeast were in the full force of the wind which is coming from the northeast . We 've got five kilometers to go so do we struggle back to the protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and ferry across the wind . We opt for sticking it out and have a bumpy , tiring but otherwise uneventful ride back to the boat launch . The wind is so hard that I 'm leery of trying to load the canoe on our roof racks for fear that itll blow off so we set the truck behind some trees to load up our gear . It means one more 50 meter lift over but were up to the task by now . While I get things loaded up Kathy slices the last of our salami , cheese and cucumber so that we can have a quick bite before we leave . We down that along with the last of our pre-made juice and were almost ready to hit the road . The last remaining task is to change into our going home clothes , wash our hands and were off . We stop at the entrance shack but of course they 're closed . Guess someone else will have to relate their bear story . On the way to Chapleau we discuss possible routes home . We settle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sudbury . As long as were going that way I volunteer to show Kathy where my son and I ended our Chapleau - Nemogosenda trip on Mate Lake . I find the road to Mate Lake and we begin the 2.5 km drive but the road is much more overgrown that it was in 1993 when we walked out and picked up the bike we stashed so Mark could ride back and pick up the truck . There is evidence that someone else has used the road recently though . We break into the clearing that marks the end of the road and there are two surprised looking guys with a tent setup and their gear strewn about . Turns out that its Fritz and Fritz from Michigan who had just been dropped off a few hours ago and were going to descend the Nemogosenda to Elsas and take the train back to Foleyet . We have a nice chat and I 'm sure that when we part that they think that Ontario must have a small population because everyone they mention we seem to know or have run into at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell them to stop and see Ron Quigley in Elsas and to tell him that I sent them . Ill be moose hunting in Elsas this fall so if the Fritzs are reading this Im going to check up on you . ( I did check up on them and Ron reported that they were wonderful guests ) By the time we leave its dusk and we set our sights on the Watershed Restaurant on 144 for dinner . We arrive there at 9:30 pm and are informed that they are closing so we grab a coffee to go and continue south . We manage to find a Golden Arches open in Chelmsford so we settle for burgers and fries ( we kinda had our mouths set for a pickerel dinner ) . The rest of the trip to Hamilton goes without a hitch and we arrive home at 6 am . Weve been up for 24 hours now so we decide to catch a little shuteye before unpacking . Today we covered 24km with no portages . <p> Conclusion : Although its a long drive from the populated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got kids theyll love the history lessons that can be interwoven in the trip with all the historic sites that are available . As I alluded to earlier you should plan to spend at least two weeks in order to get to see everything . Plan to spend a week on Missinaibi Lake and try to see the historic sites in Barclay bay and work your way around to the logging camp in Baltic Bay . The campsites here do n't  seem overused but we did see motorboaters camped at the same site for at least five days near Whitefish Bay . The second week could easily be spent in going to and from Little Missinaibi with time left to see the pictographs and explore Little Miss . We intend to return when we can spend two to three weeks so that we can explore all the nooks and crannies of Little Missinaibi and possibly get that pickerel dinner were still craving . <p> Scott and Kathy Warner 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @qwx994055 <p> Great trip ... nice that you had as much time as you did in there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we headed from the gatehouse straight to Whitefish Falls , and made camp on the river where the portage to Trump Lake begins . It was just after Labour Day , and the ranger at the park told me his crew of summer students made it up to Little Miss by sticking to the river entirely ... I figured if they could do it so could we . Ended up not being too bad ... I waded up most of the river while my buddy hopped from boulder to boulder along the shore , only getting a couple soakers . We took the Elbow-Trump route back , which was preferable to shooting the rapids section we had trudged up the day before . Incredible scenery , and definitely a trip that could last a few weeks ... lots of fish in the river to eat , if you 're so inclined . <p> Submitted by : Allan Jacobs on 2008-04-07 <p> The authors of the above report are Kathy and Scott Warner .

I gave them some planning assistance and helped them get maps , etc . The following is the story of their trip . ) The Canoeing Adventure of Ben , Rick and Caroline Location : French River/ Georgian Bay/ Pickerel River Date : Early July Day 1 Firstly , we had to get ourselves and kit from Toronto up to Hartley Bay Marina where our canoeing adventure was to start . There are a few options : the best being get someone to give you a lift ( ! ) , get the bus which is about $60 one-way and will drop you on the side of Route 69 ( not very useful with a ton of kit on your back ) and finally , what we did : hire a car . Despite what we imagined it actually worked out cheaper for the three of us to hire a car for the whole week and leave it sitting , unused , while we canoed , rather than take the bus . Once you factor in the convenience of going straight to where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave Toronto at an absurdly early hour then the petrol costs are more than worth it . Once at Hartley Bay Marina we prepared ourselves with lots of suncream ( SPF15+ ) , stowed ( OK , chucked ) our kit in the canoes and headed off with a grateful wave goodbye to Richard and Debbie who gave up half a National Holiday to see us off . Thank you very , very much ! Straight away it became apparent that the solo paddler was going to have a tough time on their own in the double canoe . Stowing the kit to the front helps a great deal in pinning the front down although even moderately strong winds would still cause problems . The C or J stroke proved to be possible and , although a bit of a killer on the arms , would keep the canoe relatively straight . However , this was slower than paddling straight strokes whilst continuously swapping sides and , being keen/stupid Brits , this is what we tended to do . At least we had more time to stop and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canoe ! " Out of Hartley Bay we headed pretty much straight across Wanapitei Bay ( I havent got the map with me at the moment so excuse my spelling ) to the more Northerly of the two campsites which are close together on the Western shore . We had only paddled a short distance , taking around an hour and a quarter , but it was four oclock so we decided to call it a day , well aware that our first attempts at cooking , making camp , etc would be relatively slow as is with all things new . The campsite was very pretty - a good introduction to our journey . Rick saw a water snake in the shallows which swam away as we approached it . They are n't  supposed to be poisonous so we felt brave ! Once camp was made , including stringing up the food ropes ( about which there is more to say later ) we all went for as refreshing swim . Later , Rick and I ( Ben ) decided to go fishing with our $5 lure ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $15 ) . We trolled up and down with a line out the back of our canoe for 45 minutes . Of course , we caught nothing but there would be plenty of time other evenings and we were optimistic . One point that occurred to us was that we would have to catch a fish before about 6pm in order to be able to eat it for dinner that evening . No one would fancy fish for breakfast the next morning and we doubt it would be very hygienic to keep it till the next evening . At seven oclock we settled down to cook our pasta and tuna with tomato sauce . It was quite delicious and we all felt content as we lay back supping our coffees watching the sunset . <p> MISTAKE ! At half eight we were engulfed by the biggest , meanest swarm of mosquitoes we had ever seen . We thought being down by the waters edge was protection enough and that the bad period we had been warned of had surely passed ( a few had bitten earlier ) . Oh no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapping ourselves and swinging around at thin air . Anyone watching from a distance would have thought we 'd gone crazy or , if they were Canadian , would have had a darned good laugh . In between the flailing of limbs we gathered together the food into packs and climbed the slope to where the rope was set out . Oh yes , the rope . Mistake number two was to think we could pull up our full food packs on a single rope . Too much friction meant no matter how hard we pulled and pushed the packs remained only a little over six foot off the ground . All the while we were being bitten in a thousand places and going half crazy because the @ ! * ! @ ! were crawling over us and our hands werent free to even try and stop them . In a perfect world we would set a second rope up ( we did have a spare ) but what with the Apache war dancing , worse now we were amongst the trees , there was no way we were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - if you can stand these mosquitoes you deserve the food . We raced back to the tent , dived in , shut the screen doors and then quickly killed anything that moved . We then sat there , panting slightly and sweating from our exertions . As we sat there slightly shocked with no one talking we heard the most eerie whine of thousands of mosquitoes filling the woods around our tent . As we lay there we could see dozens covering the net screen doors of the tent pushing their little needles back and forth through the netting ( like the knife wielding maniac in Psycho ) . We heard a howling sound in the distance ( wolves ? - more likely Loons we later rationalised ) then the snapping of twigs outside the tent . Could it be a bear ? At this point there was no way I was going out to look . If a bear chose to rip open our tent I was more scared of the mosquitoes that would get in and suck the life out of me than any old bear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the woods with even a small amount of skin uncovered . If you did n't  die of blood loss or allergic shock , the mad crazed war dancing would send you off some high rock or other similar fate . That night we talked in hushed tones feeling isolated and a little vulnerable . All the while , the constant whine of the mosquitoes filled the woods . Day 2 We awoke around 6.30am to a beautiful sunny day A quick breakfast of blueberry bagels with peanut butter and jam ( Mmm ) prepared us for the day ahead . It took about two hours to eventually get on the water , mainly due to inexperience . Later on it was to take us only an hour to get going as we improved . We paddled down Wanapitei Bay and turned right into the Western Channel of the French River . Despite the number of cottages and motor boats ( mostly they would slow down for us ) the scenery was awesome . We were also privileged to see a beaver which dove below the surface with a loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute later it came up right next to Ricks canoe and slapped the water in an explosion of foaming water - I nearly jumped out of my canoe but the look of shock on Ricks face was worth it ! Water was n't a problem but we were lucky . Our silver based purifying tablets took two hours to act and we had only three , one litre , water bottles . It was necessary to re-fill and purify the bottles as soon as they were empty otherwise we would have had problems . This is something we felt we could have planned better so water was always readily available in more quantity . Luckily , three bottles was just enough . Paddling the solo canoe was harder work and we tended to swap around very one and a half hours or so . Unfortunately , Rick got the last leg just as the winds started to pick up ( now about 11.30am ) which made it hard going for him . However , an hour later we made it to a pretty sandy beach just above the Delta which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up camp we enjoyed a refreshing swim and spent the rest of the day playing off the rocks . I managed to produce a small water-colour memory of the view opposite the campsite whilst Caroline slept and Rick relaxed . We saw another water snake which , this time , came out of the water , sunned itself and then disappeared into the reeds . We also saw some bear scat so made an extra good job of getting the packs up into the trees . Two ropes worked very well without the need for brute strength which had been necessary the first night . We also found it easier to climb the tree in order to loop the rope round a branch because there were too many small twigs making it difficult to get a clear throw . In fact from then on , whenever the throw looked a bit tricky , we would simply climb the tree . Of course we fished but , despite a claimed bite , we caught nothing . Surely , we would soon be successful ? That night we ate well and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We fell asleep feeling very smug that we had cheated the surrounding hordes out of a second juicy meal . Day 3 We awoke at 6am exactly to be greeted by the most spectacular sunrise with mist over the water for added effect . After the usual breakfast we packed up and headed for the Delta . Despite our initial worries , navigation proved to OK as long as we kept a close eye on the map and were aware of our position . We saw more beavers and some small otter-like creatures which scampered across the rocks , into and out of the water . The experience was almost magical as we made our way slowly between the rocks in , quite often , narrow channels . Taking photographs was easy as wherever you pointed the camera you were bound to see something interesting ! We encountered only slight increases in flow at the rapids although the Petit Faucille required we portage . Coming out of the Delta we got a little lost , having underestimated how far we had come . However , the view of Georgian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to see a few hundred yards at most and now we could see to the horizon . Needless to say , the cameras came out again . This view was short-lived as we went straight into Root Beer Creek ( East Cross Channel ) , along with a bunch of friendly sea-kayakers . The water was indeed a deep brown colour , full of lilies and the surface alive with insects . There were many shallow sections and lots of push-overs which caused the sea-kayakers to turn back leaving us to head on alone once again . I was quite captivated by this section where the river wound back and forth over shallows with at least one beaver dam . We were constantly hopping in and out of the canoes which further added to the fun . Once again , we broke out into the wide open spaces of Georgian Bay . It was midday so we felt ready to stop . Lunch ( pitta bread and tuna ) at one of a pair of campsites at the mouth of a large channel ( the inlet with Sabina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The campsite was a very small windswept island so we decided to try the neighbouring island . Rick and Caroline paddled across while I swam . Boy ! The water was much colder here than in the river - I swam pretty fast . The second campsite proved to be idyllic with a lovely area for the tent and a fire ring with log bench already in situ . Once set up , we swam and lazed around . My back gave up on me that afternoon causing me a huge amount of pain and severely reduced mobility . However , aside from the frustration , the worst thing was that feeling of helplessness . A combination of youth , over-the-counter pain killers ( also anti-inflammatory which was the main reason for taking them ) and taking it easy saw most of the problems go away . In fact , I think the problem arose because of my poor sitting posture in the canoe and over the next few days I concentrated on sitting very upright which saw the problem go away in less than two days . Back sufferers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results and our previous optimism was now foundering . Just one fish , pleeeaasee ! ! That evening we ate a royal meal of potatoes which made a welcome change from tuna and pasta . Unfortunately , the sky , which had been clouding over all afternoon , started to threaten rain . Sure enough , it came but was light enough to allow us to sit outside and eat under a tree . We anticipated stronger rain and , by way of preparation , moved the tent away from the trees ( lightning ) and onto a sloped rock to avoid water building up . We also pulled the canoes well up and tied them off securely . That night we slept well with only light rain showers now and again . Day 4 We awoke to a cloudy day with a brisk wind blowing from the North East , the so-called prevailing winds had deserted us . The water was quite choppy with occasional white horses dancing on the wave tops . It was obvious the solo canoe would n't be controllable with the wind coming onto its side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic to you Canadian guys ) so it would be towed behind the double canoe . With great caution we set off and crossed a large expanse of water to the other side of the inlet . It was all a bit frantic but we were making reasonable progress and the canoe did n't  seem to threatened by the waves . However , as we rounded the headland to cross the next large bay ( I think this was the inlet to the French River Main Channel ) the full force of the wind and waves hit us . We battled hard into the wind to try to get up the inlet and reduce the amount of open water we would have to cross . Although we were progressing it was painfully slow and we werent able to maintain direction very well . At this point we decided to pull in and see if we could walk the canoes up further . An ingenious ( if I say so ) use of the food ropes allowed two of us to fly the canoes off a windward shore like a kite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the rocks . See below : A few hundred meters of this and we had to get in again . Despite the hilarity ( I could hardly breathe ) of Rick falling backward into a canoe to leave his arms and legs sticking up either side of the canoe , we realised that to push on would be dangerous . The risk of us actually capsizing werent great but the consequences of a capsize were . A capsize with an offshore wind would leave us in big trouble . Even if we could have made it out we would probably spend at least an hour in the water which was very cold and would most certainly lead to hypothermia or worse . Decision made , we landed on a likely looking spot and made camp . At this point Rick thought he saw something whilst collecting wood for the fire - we also saw lots of scat and what we thought looked like a bears den . A walk , later on , confirmed our suspicions - we all saw a bear ! It looked at us for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts beating quickly we made our way back to the camp and read a leaflet all about bears . This gave us some confidence that all would be well although the bit about " fighting a black bear as hard as possible is best instead of playing dead " made us laugh . Still , we were all thrilled to have seen it - we think a small female Black bear , around the size of a large Rottweiler dog . At this point we would have liked to move away from the area but the wind had actually built since earlier and this wasnt really an option . We prepared the food ropes on a separate , downwind island to be safe but otherwise hoped our usual precautions would be enough . This other island was covered in blueberries ( yummy ) but also bear scat . We were obviously very close especially as some of the scat was quite fresh . Strangely we did n't  feel scared at all . The small size of the bear and the way it had turned and fled instilled us with confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun shone for the rest of the day so we made the most of it by playing off the rocks and lazing in the sun . Swimming was possible but , again , the water was extremely cold . We also went on our last fishing foray . Having spent an hour catching- nothing we caught a rock and lost the lure . That was that . No fish , $20 poorer and a few wasted hours - oh well ! That night , before dozing off to sleep , I remember we all felt sorry for the poor bear as a million little winged fiends once again filled the woods with their incessant , eerie whine . Day 5 Up again at 6am and we were greeted to the start of a most perfect day . Clear blue skies and water like a mill pond spurred us to get going quickly and we were on the water in no time . We had thought we would make a break for up the Main Channel seeing as we had lost a day but when the decision had to made we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather was so perfect that we should press on for our original route . The trip across Georgian Bay was magical and , because the water was so calm , we headed directly across without hugging the coastline . All around was deep clear blue water often with rocks rising up in the middle of huge open expanses of water but not quite breaking the surface . I took the opportunity to stand on such a rock making it look like I was standing in the middle of an ocean with nothing but blue skies and horizon behind me . It felt terrific . Almost too soon , we turned up into the Pickerel River and entered a new landscape of rocks and sparse trees . The wind was starting to pick up now so the paddling was getting harder . Nevertheless we enjoyed the gentle turns of the Pickerel as we headed on to the second campsite ( of the group of three ) which was situated on a bend in the river . It was midday and we were tired from our 17km paddle but pleased with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back on track . A lunch of tuna and pitta bread revitalised us enough for a swim in the lovely warm water . Rick and I went some distance , spotting more of the small otter like creatures . Once back , we enjoyed a wash before lazing away the afternoon . As this was to be our last evening we ate a handsome feast for supper . We had a whole 2/3rds of a tin of tuna each ! That night we all slept well with full stomachs and tired arms . Day 6 The morning was overcast and quite cool . We ate breakfast and packed up quickly before heading off for the final leg of the journey . The water levels were low because what had been described as a shallow passage was definitely a portage . As soon as we had got through this one we were confronted with another bigger portage . It has to be said that we all hate having to get all the gear our of the boats and ferry the whole lot over , quite often , uneven terrain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling tired and a little irritable . The river started to narrow here and the lilies eventually gave way to a beaver dam followed by marsh . There was nothing for it but to get out and push/pull the canoes through the mud . All the while we were nearly falling over or getting stuck and all conscious of the risk of leeches . Strangely , this was actually good fun although we were relieved to make back out into open water once again . From then on it became a slog to get to the end . Our minds were all fixed on getting back and the quicker the better . Respite came in the form of a snack stop where we saw our first chipmunk . Although it was still early , we all wanted to finish - Wanapitei Bay went on forever even though we were paddling faster than ever before and when we turned into Hartley Bay it was some relief . The last few kilometres to the marina saw the canoes going faster and faster until ( not unlike Hawaii 50 ) we were flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaged over 8km/hr for the last five km ! ) Even though our arms were burning and threatening to give out altogether we grimly pushed on a bit further till the dock was within a hundred or so metres . We coasted in with huge grins on our faces . The whole journey had been an adventure which we will talk about for years to come . We all thoroughly enjoyed the experience and will definitely be back for more . <p> Maps Required <p> Topo Maps ( 1:50,000 ) : <p> 41 I/2 Delamere 41 H/16 Noganosh Lake <p> Other Maps : <p> French River Provincial Park map - shows all campsites and portages <p> Photo Gallery <p> Hover to see name &amp; click to enlarge &amp; see Photo Description . <p> File Download Section <h> Download GPS track <p> Just a comment incase you return someday , which I hope you do .

Many campsites on official map have overgrown <p> Thanks to Seth Wotten for the following comments <p> I have some information that would be very useful for all paddlers planning to trek up Maple . <p> Many years ago , I heard a rumor that there was a spring on top of Maple Mountain off of one of the multitude of paths going off on the north side of the mountain . The whole way over from Mowats Landing , I tried to get some confirmation from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . They answered either " No , I 've never heard of this spring " or " Yeah , that 's an old legend , but there 's no spring there .... I 've checked myself " . <p> We climbed the mountain early in the morning on our third day , and entirely confident that I would find this spring , I insisted that we bring all of our gear to the top so that we could camp up there . Once we were up there , after I had climbed the tower ( at my own risk ) and admired the view , I ventured off to the north side to find the spring . I spent hours taking the time to follow each trail a fair distance , with no success . Finally , I somehow lost one of the trails on my way back , and after a short bushwack , I was following a new trail that brought me back to the fire tower area , except , there was a tree completely obstructing the path right before the clearing . <p> Realizing that I had returned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided to check out this secret pathway that I had discovered . About less than a five minute walk down the path , I found the spring . It was not quite what I had expected , and appeared to be more of a hole in the ground than anything else , contained by some tree roots and rocks . However , I noticed a trickle of water coming from the roots , and dipped my finger in the water to find that it was frigidly cold . I ran back to the fire tower area to get my drybag , and ran back to fill my drybag with the help of my water bottle . When I returned the next morning , the water level had replenished itself to the level it was at the previous day . I have returned on several occasions since to find that the spring was still there . <p> These are the best directions I can come up with : Walk north of the fire tower towards the wooded area . There is one main path that gives you the option of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the left .... go left . The path that will take you directly to the spring is your first or most likely second right , however , it is a hidden pathway . It is covered by some type of evergreen ( probably a pine of some sort ) sitting right where the pathway begins . Pull back some branches and look for the path . <p> If you do not manage to find it , try entering the wooded area from one of the other paths and bushwacking accross . <p> Just a final note . I have noticed bear scat close to the area on a couple occasions , so I 'm guessing that the bears go there to drink too . Watch out for bears and make sure that you treat your water . <p> Left Newmarket at 5:30 p.m. in hot and muggy 32 C weather .

We declined his offer and headed up to Mowat Landing in a drizzle <p> The road in was the first time David had seen a 500 series provincial highway done in gravel ( that gradually decreased to a backwoods road ) in all his years in Civil Eng . There was nothing much at Mowat Landing but a good large ( free ) parking lot , a government dock ( no put in fees ) , and a small lodge with docking and restaurant . <p> Rain stopped just as we unloaded , and got on the water at 11 a.m . It was a 15 min. paddle to the first portage around the dam . For $6.50 you could have your motor boat ( or canoe ) trailered across the easy 270m portage . A fisher dude was having his boat taken across , and he let us throw all the gear on with his boat at no charge . Head winds all the way up the Lady Evelyn River . No current to speak of , although the rapids/falls must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddle in rocky shield country , and we could smell the pines . Two nice sites very close together on the way up to the lake ( probably 1 site on Temagami map ) , but like all of the sites we encountered for the rest of the day , they were taken with motorboat fishing parties . Did not find second site on E. side . <p> South wind on L. Evelyn and threatening weather made our stop for lunch quick at the only vacant site ( second small site on the S. ) Only room for 1 tent , on a very exposed site . We continued travelling around the south end of the East arm , and made a mad , calculated dash in the waves and head wind to the big island . Tried to find the sites in the S. Eskers recommend by Ted with the binoculars , but had to paddle right to S. end of the Eskers to find them . Looked good , but of course they were taken . The site on the point was vacant , but terrible sloped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights the generator noise from the Lodge across the way was bad . Waves got bigger , so we took the last site on the North most esker . Very nice at 5m 15 m wide , 5 m high , with sand , pine and nice swimming area . A lot of bush cleared , and trees cut on campsite ( do n't  those darn fishermen know you ca n't burn green wood ? ) and there was little protection from the wind . Very little garbage , despite the fact that there really was 3 separate camp sites along this esker , and the thunderbox was full . We set the tent up quickly , trying to pushing it back into the bush at the most protected level spot , but not wanting to enlarge the site . Thunderstorm was swinging in from S to W. to N. around us with wind still from the SSW . Just about all set up , David on last rope of tarp , and me starting supper behind a wind-break of an old table top . Got a surprise when the windbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the warning we got . Suddenly there was 15 seconds of silence . It was not enough time to take cover . <p> The storm hit from the North with full force . David ran and tried to drop the tarp , but the hail and rain ( which was coming in parallel to the water ) was too strong , and he dove to join me behind the canoe . It was rather funny - I had leaned it against two trees as a wind-break for the wind from the SSW so that I could cook , yet I had to leap across it to take shelter on the S side ! The wind had raised it and turned it up on its side so that it was being flattened against the trees . Glad we had the bottom of the boat taking the brunt of the storm but prayed that it could take the stress of the incredible wind ! The tent was flattened in seconds , and two poles broke and the ridge pole bent . It would not have mattered what type of tent we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably would have been the same . <p> The violence ended after about 10 min . Several trees ( huge ! ) came down 30m E. of campsite . Sad to think they had survived so many years and then in seconds their life was over . Very high winds and waves splashing up the 5m banks on the N side for the next 24 hours . We got lucky in that I had put a huge plastic drop sheet in the tent ( David has promised never to make fun of it again ) , and were able to crawl into the downed wreckage and fold it in half over the gear ( sleeping bags etc. ) before the rain totally soaked it through it . We were very lucky to be safe and have dry gear as the temperature really dropped ( and continued to drop for the next few days ) . Took 2 hours to priotize and clean up the damage . Thanked God many times that we intuitively react to do the right thing to help each other in an emergency and that neither one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and potatoes a welcome warm up as we tried to dry everything out . We were afraid to have a fire with winds so high it was hard to stand . Scary and scared . Listened and felt the wicked howling N winds all night . My weather predicting skills were certainly going to be tested on this trip ! <p> Sunday July 1 , 2001 ( Wind-bound on Lady Evelyn L. ) <p> Could hear the big storm gusts coming again at 4 a.m . Woke up and could see our breath at 6 a.m . Wind-bound ; off and on rain . Set about drying everything out by holding it in the wind . We were afraid to peg it on a line as the winds were too strong . Sand blew off of the esker and stung us , as did the rain that came frequently in gusts . Packed up quickly and set about moving everything to the down-slope of the lee side there was not a lot room to move about on this isle . Gulped bacon and omlet . Could hear the wind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cover under the canoe ( which we had tilted up and wedged between 3 trees ) . Spent the whole day like this , and it was very scary . David slept sitting up by the canoe . I sat and waited . We could n't read or write because of the storm . We were very cold and had to layer up exactly as if we were out in winter ( later found out it snowed in Timmins that day ) . <p> A couple from Cincinnati who had ventured out from the Lodge at Island 10 became wind-bound on our island for 5 hours before they crazily risked heading out into the 1m waves . More trees coming down scared them . They offered to take us with them , but we had built a snug shelter from the tarp , canoe , plastic and gear ( used the sail as a door ) . There was no need to risk drowning ! <p> Winds died a bit around 9 p.m. , and we saw a couple coming down the lake in a canoe . Were they every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sail they could have done the whole N. side of the lake in 45 min . <p> We spent the night in the shelter , and there was no bugs thank heavens ! No exactly romantic , but it definitely filled the adventure-seeking part of the trip . Condensation got the sleeping bags damp because we had put the plastic under the over us , but otherwise okay very snug . <p> Alarm went off at 4:30 a.m. , but David would n't wake up until I really shook him at 4:55 a.m . We leaped up and pulled tarp back and frantically packed up . Managed to paddle away by 5:30 a.m. with the wind rising again . Dashed by Island 10 , and boy is their generator noisy . Site on the point across from them looks nice , but we would n't want the noise . <p> Obisaga Narrows very pretty , and we noted that it would have been nice to have been " stuck " here . Even with the head winds and white caps we could see lovely reflections in the water of the weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along here looked fine . The N arm of L. Evelyn really had the wind blasting down it , so we crept along the N. side . Looked like 2 sites on the S. side were taken . We could see 3 canoes in the distance ( looked like they were from a camp ) and they were scattered all over the place . One more canoe pulled off an unofficial site on a point to the N. about + of the way along . ( It must have been a large one as it turned they were the group of 14 girls from Keewaydin that we met on Maple Mountain ) . Could now see the tower on Maple Mountain clearly . We got quite excited that we could be climbing it tomorrow <p> Found the portage okay in the S end of the little bay behind the island . It paced out at 100m , not 270m as the map said . Had to push a mass of floating logs away at both ends of the portage . Sucker Gut Lake has an ugly name but is gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 km rather than taking the portage . Passed one island site that was taken , then breakfasted on an island unofficial site at 8:30 a.m. across from a number of loons and 2 brown herons who did not care about us . Headed out again at 9:15 a.m. with headwinds now from the S. Found cut off to Hobart L. with the help of the topo . The scale on the Temagami map is too big , and really cant see any detail . Had a bit of trouble finding the narrows to get to Willow Island Creek . The big island it is behind is now connected by bog to the " mainland " . Fought the winds to get to the narrows from a distance the white-caps coming through there looked like dancing white water ( rapids ) ! David was hoping that this would satisfy my craving for wild water , but it did n't  quite do it . <p> Every way we turned we had headwinds , and decided that it must be the topography of the region ( later found out that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ontario ) . Hobart was pretty . First site was quite sloped and only 1 good tent pad . The " beach site " that Hap described was taken , but had a look at the second site on the E , which did look good . We had planned on going to Anvil as we had been advised that all the sites in this area would be taken , and to avoid the thundering herds of tourists we were better to camp N of Tupper Creek . David really wanted to stick to the trip plan , so on we went . Almost missed the creek in to Tupper , but made a note of it for our return trip to Maple Mountain . Took a loopy route through Old Bill L. to the creek and saw a loon on her nest with her neck stretched out and very still . Ended up by creek okay with the help of the topo . Portage was easy to find . Looked well used , but did n't  look like anyone had been on it yet this year . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and managed to drag under the big one . <p> Bessie and Inez Lakes were both quite swampy , and portages in the same condition as the one from Old Bill . Anvil was pretty-ish . Did not take time to investigate the very old sites right at the portage , although could see 3 fire rings from water . We took the site on the point at 2:45 p.m . No flat spot to put tent unless we went back into the bush and then there was 3 good spots . I wanted to sleep on the sloped sites , out from under the tress . There was enough protection from the wind , but I was spooked by our Esker experience . David humoured me . <p> No thunderbox , but absolutely no garbage . Either people must pack it out or burn it . Lots of trees down , and tonnes of loose , dried wood and brush ( area is ripe for a burn through ) . No animals on the site except for 1 red squirrel . Spent rest of day drying out gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lunch . Bug situation lousy . Lasagne for supper . Realized we totally missed Canada Day ! What a disappointment to not have celebrated it for the first time in many years ! Asleep and slip sliding at 10 : 30 p.m. up for 18 hours , and covered 34 kms . Too bad we had to make up the lost day , it would have been nice to dawdle . <p> Drizzle started again at 3:15 a.m . Awake at 7 a.m. but not quickly up . At 10 a.m. the rain finally stopped . Funny how tired we were considering that we were not at home getting up with the baby or spending the morning wrestling with Iain ! On the water at 11:30 a.m. to Maple Mountain . Checked out W campsite . It was a huge meadow that has a road coming into it . Found garbage in the bush and a dock ready to be put in . Looks like it is well used in the fall . Lousy view , and no breeze . Beach is too shallow for swimming . <p> Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Hobart or Tupper . Much easier doing them in one trip . Stopped to look at the rock garden creeks , full of trees and ledges . I gave a brief sigh , wishing we could have made the Dumoine trip for this year work out . Saw fresh signs of moose and wolf , and old signs of bear . Saw our first of many loons eating a fish . The loon was quite unconcerned with us , and gave us a show . A beaver splashed and dove as we went back through Old Bill . Into the head winds , it took 2.5 hours to get back to the creek to Tupper Lake . Tupper L. is swampy and has a beaver dam to lift over at its entrance . Mistook the campsite for the entrance to the trail to Maple Mountain . Site had 4 canoes parked in it , but the Keewaydin wanigans gave us the tip off . Nice flat and clean 4 tent site ( no thunderbox ) , but no decent swimming , and all cedars . Used the binoculars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we would have found it if we had not seen the 3 tips of the Keewaydin canoes pulled up . Have to remember that it is exactly opposite the entrance to the lake . The trail sign was back in the bush . Take-out was very mucky . <p> The first half-hour of the trail was in very bad shape . It is swampy , buggy and mucky with the boardwalk so rotted that it is almost not usable . Lots of blow-downs . Became very narrow and rugged , and was glad I had broken down and bought my first pair of hiking boots , and that the boots were waterproof . Took 30 min to get to first trail sign , another 30 min to the lake , and then 30 more min to the top . Glad we had brought lots of water , as there really was no where to get any . Trail overgrown with pines and ferns and very narrow . Once we left the swampy section , the climb was almost always up ! Met the Keewaydin gals on the way down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birchbark off of a big healthy tree . Was worried when we passed half of a ladder . Rounded the corner , and could see that the other half was still on the cliff . Scary climb up for people who do not like heights ! But not as scary as crawling up the next section ! Worth the fantastic view that suddenly appeared though . Put Silver Peak to shame . ( Silver Peaks trails paved and well groomed in comparison to this trail , and does n't  give the same surprise when you get to the top ) . Oh how we enjoyed every minute up on this beautiful ridge . <p> Had lunch in a wicked wind . Drenched in sweat , but forced to layer up as the temp . dropped . The bugs up in this neck of the woods do n't  seem to mind the wind , and have never heard that they are n't  supposed to like DEET . Many alpine meadow trails well worn , with lots of teeny maple trees to be seen . Using the topos we could see our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined to try the tower . I started up , but the wind was making it sway crazily , so I hastily came back down . Could see rain coming , sunny patches in the distance , and Ishpatina Ridge 40 km away ( Ontarios highest point ) . Did n't  take time to find the spring at the top Was surprised to find a the spring as the head of the little inlet back at the canoes . Upset that camera battery died without on the way down , right at a dramatic moment in our decent , and could not even retract the zoom or close the lens . <p> Took 1 hr 25 min to come back down and it sure was easier coming down but still a challenge to this out of shape post-partum body . No trail not markings to be seen on the way down , and at one point the trail split and it was not clear which way to go . Beat the rain , but not the bugs . Loaded up quickly and headed home to Anvil . Took 2 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 6 kms . Fresh moose tracks on our prints coming out of Inez . Exhausted and smelly we took a swim ( water very cold ) and made a " one match fire " , had Tuna Helper for supper ( note : 2 cans of dried tuna just perfect ) . Discussed our great day and decided that if we came back we would stay on Sucker Gut , or Hobart , then the next day do the climb and move on to Anvil . <p> Awake at 7 , drizzling , so up at 9:45 . Hard to get going when stiff even though we were getting more sleep than we had had in 10 months . Rain cleared to sun , then overcast . Still quite cold . Porridge and dried strawberries go down great . Have convinced David we do n't  need to cook them just add hot water to the rolled oats and cover them . New titanium grill excellent for toasting bagels and English muffins over fire or stove . <p> As we left the site an otter crossed our bow with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NE of us as we had thought , although one could easily be bushwhacked if ever needed as it had clearings and was level . Nice moose marsh to E that we could have paddled in to . Last site on lake ( 2nd on W. side ) is a gem . Large ( 6 tents ) , flat , on a point with a nice swim area , and great views . Very clean , and like everywhere else , lots of deadwood for the fire , and trees down . More sheltered than the site we had . <p> Headed NW around island and found that you can get around it either way . Beaver had made a pond with dams ( 6 ! ) all around it , so we lifted in and then out . Willow Island Creek was right there at the NNE corner . A short paddle up found us at a section with trees across it . No way around on the shore to the left . David fought his way around on the E until he saw a yellow " P " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through on shore , so forced and cut our way around and under the trees . Hard to manoeuvre a 17.5 boat in this area . Portage nice and flat and in great shape no rocks ! From here on in we paddle and wade/track/drag through sand and gravel beds ( our poor boat " bled " red all the way up the river ) and L/O numerous beaver dams . Hap says L/O rocks and do a 75m portage , followed by numerous others , but there was no point when there was a great trail ( on Temagami map ) of 495m that ran through a small one tent camp site . <p> Rain became very heavy . Canoe filled up while we were making the second trip , and needed dumping . Even layered in our good quality Gore-Tex rain coats we were cold and soaked through top to bottom . A short paddle up the creek to a 45m portage on E. Good take out and terrible put in . As we paddled away , I looked back and saw that if we had of kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rocks at the official put in , we may have avoided balancing on the wet boulders , then having to immediately L/O another beaver dam . A short paddle to the 825m . Saw HUGE fresh bear prints on a sandbar in the middle of the river not even filled with rain yet . Had to L/O a big dam just before " P " sign . <p> Even though there was a sign , it was very hard to find trail . Turned out that the creek Hap mentioned was backed up because of the dam . Once we went up the creek a bit , we could see a rocky bit that looked like a possibility , and a teeny piece of flagging tape . The official trail would now cross this creek . Trail was horrible . After the first 50m of slippery rolling rock , we were on to a trail that did n't  look used at all . How could all the previous trails look so well used , and then this one have ferns and small pines growing right in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even could n't see your feet ? Very muddy in spots as we were passing through a buggy cedar swamp . Lots of fresh moose droppings . Had to clear a lot of old dead stuff out of the way . After this one we made it a habit to carry the gear first , and then come back for the canoe and last pack . Funny though , the last 100m was in great shape , and the put-in at the other end well defined ! Too buggy to go looking for the old mine shaft that Hap mentioned . <p> Bergeron L. was just lovely with white quartz cliffs . Did not find site by portage . Had lunch at the next site down . Climbed up the 4m cliff to get to it . Only place to put a tent was in the 3 m long space in front of the fire pit ! Nice view though . Tortillas de-laminating , but the salsa and black bean dip rehydrated beautifully , and were very tasty with the jerky . Clockit Soya Snacks ( BBQ ) were a hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was super small too . <p> Steep rock and a bit of muck at the 85m portage to the Lily Pond and another rain-burst . What an incredible site awaited us ! The sun peaked through , and we found that the pond was now a lake thanks to an industrious beaver that had built two huge tiered dams , raising the lake by maybe 15 and then another 5 . What a feat ! <p> Lake was a treat . Lots of flowers and quartz . All kinds of pitcher plants on the E bog by the prospector caves . Caves were up on the rock above the scree and very interesting . Miners must have been tough cookies to do this work and we could find no blast holes ! Both caves filled with water . The top one had an interesting purple/pink strip running down the rock . It was all just fascinating , and we did not want to leave . The lake was so high we paddle right up the W arm of Niccolite L. There was certainly no beaver dam as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main body of Niccolite . <p> The largest island ( with the recommended campsite ) is now partially flooded , and did n't  look usable . The smallest island was almost all submerged and looked strange with the green trees sticking out . The small campsites had a great view , but did not stop to check them out closer . Nice tail winds . <p> The portage at the end of the lake had us both questioning our sanity . David was sure it must be the next 425 it took us so long to do it , and said it was the worst flat portage ( versus dragging and over boulders and a cliff like the one on the Chapleau ) he had done in 25 years . Unfortunately it was 235m - of misery . It was basically a spring run off creek full of small boulders with a bit of muck in between each boulder . The driving rain had made the rocks slippery and we could not step on them even to get over the blow downs . Too high to climb over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being higher , we cut 10m off by paddling up it a bit further by going to the right of the flagging tape . <p> Headed to the east . then north up the creek and could then see clearly why creek we had just crawled around was not negotiable from either end . Lockie Lake smaller than the Lily Pod but very pretty despite the head winds and white caps . Saw lots more pitcher plants and flowers on the floating bogs . All paths through the bog lead to the portage ( 425m ) which was easy . Nice sand beach put in . <p> Holden L. had small white rocks all the way around it , sort of like people do to decorate their gardens . Next 100m portage starts off interesting and has an awkward put in , but it was fine in the middle . <p> Greenwater L. was pretty , and both sites good . The S. site had room for 2 tents and a nice swimming area , but was more exposed to the howling wind , and had some fresh downs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portage . Not that that made a difference , the bear could have swam down to the next site where we stayed ! The west site had 3 nice tent pads 1 out front and 2 behind . Not a great spot to get in and out of the water , but a nice view of the cliffs . Too cold and very high winds , so did not attempt a swim . Pulled in at 5:30 p.m . All the gear was dry by 6:30 , so there were benefits to having a wind . Site did not appear to have been used in a while . The ferns were growing on all the tent pads , and the split wood that someone had kindly left behind was quite old . Lots more deadfall and tinder around ( and just the right size ) for the picking , but winds too high to have fire . Stew for supper , and enough left over for breakfast . It really rehydrated well ! Must remember that adding extra meat and veggies to this Knorr soup mix will give enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to be amazed at how clean all the sites have been , although some of the fire pits are full , and we were disappointed to see many huge half burned logs . It was very cold again , and had to layer up for bed . I think we will have terminal toque heads . <p> Alarm at 7 a.m. , and up immediately work to try and beat the wind . Stew for breakfast and then on the water at 9 after trying to work around the smatterings of rain that kept coming in and the strong wind coming from the gap in the hills across the lake . 790m portage was a grunt over the blow downs and took 1.5 hours because of the weather . The 3 wet spots Hap had mentioned were now creeks filled with black muck into which my paddle blade sunk up to the shaft . The third one was the biggest , and to make it just a " wee " bit more challenge , there was yet another tree down in the middle of it that had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with muck after a fine balancing act and just about making it out of the mire . Well , we could either laugh or cry . We did not quite collapse into each others arms in laughter ( hysteria ? ) but it was close . A pair of pheasants joined us , showing no fear . Saw a huge pine ( 2m around ) that was freshly down . It had a rock that had to be 5 wide that it had pulled up with the roots that surrounded it . <p> Little Skull a garbage lake , with an easy portage of 80m out of it into Skull . We did n't  find the first site , but from a distance the island looked good through the driving liquid " sunshine " . The long 2450m ( 4hrs ) portage would have you have you tap dancing easily around the rocks in the first 400m if it was dry . Not as much of a climb at the beginning as we expected , but then into an area with lots of trees down . The first section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top of the roots ) and then took 4 others with it . Another trail with ferns and pines growing over it so we could n't see our feet . The creek and boggy section not bad , but the bugs were awful I think a cross Canada convention had been called in our honour . Last half of the trail sloped mostly down . One spot on the trail was so overgrown , we had trouble finding a trail at all . <p> Crossing the last creek was a little tricky . We followed Yogi Bear across ( there were 3 fresh LARGE piles of scat one of them still steaming ) , and still sight-unseen friend Morris the Moose . After 4 days , we would have appreciated a glimpse ! David is not a whistler , but he sure let Yogi know we were coming by tweet tweeting all the way . There were lovely fresh prints at the put in , showing that he had moved on . Two pheasants flew out under my nose on the second trip , and one hit the paddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour later . <p> It rained the whole portage with a driving rain , until my waterproof boots were just constantly overflowing . Almost like having a ritzy jet spa for my feet except that they had turned to blocks of ice under my wool socks . The extra weight made it like walking through deep water in slow motion . I must have let the purple dry pack slip . Hurt my shoulder blade , and ended up with bad bruises all around my shoulders and upper arms . We were wet and cold again right through the raingear -not a dry spot to be found anywhere . Portage would not have been that bad if not for the weather . Between the sprinkles and the bugs , we did not stop for a snack until the very end , and had lunch on the site . Put to Mendelssohn in was okay we only had to wade out a little bit and get our feet wet Ha ha . <p> The first site had a tent pad that was exposed , and lots of old garbage behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , three good flat spots for tents and was very clean . It was around the point and very nice . David did the tarp lickety split and it looked welcoming to set up under . I was so cold we finally got our sleeping bags out , put on every dry piece of clothing we had and climbed in . David had supper ready before I dared to join him- having hypothermia was a tad unpleasant . From now on I will break down and bring an extra set of long johns , then I wont be afraid to wear them under my paddle clothes , fleece and rain suit ! Again it was too cold to swim and get rid of the Deet , and too windy for a fire . Thought it was weird that there were no fishermen from the lodge in sight . <p> Very low black clouds brought more sudden violet rain-squalls . Occasionally we could see how tall the clouds were , but above them it was beautiful sunny blue skies . Had Knorr Parma Rosa Sauce on tiny pasta tubes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to help speed the warming up , but also to eat it before the rain hit again and the bugs had time to contact all their relatives . Leaped back into the tent for the night . Once the winds died down it seemed to warm up . It is the first night we have not had to sleep layered up . <p> At 3:09 a.m. we were both suddenly awakened by a huge splash . Sounded like someone throwing boulders in the water . No splashing like moose , no snuffing like bear , just a big splash . It happened a couple of more times . The lake was very quiet , and wind had died . There were no shore noises at all . Maybe it was someone playing tricks ? Dumping toxic waste ? It started again at 3:59 , still right in front of the site , about 20m away . We heard 9 more large " 5lb rock " type splashes heading down the lake . Eerie . Probably just fish dancing after their bug appetizers <p> Alarm went off at 7 a.m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was NO longer FUNNY . It had been a terrific trip , but there are limits to how wet and cold you want to be . Thank heavens it stopped by 7:20 . Tried to do a quick pack up in between watching the skies . Found a metal plate high in a pine the pine had mostly grown over it . We would see 1962 and part of a name . Bush too dense to fight our way back to see the old prospectors cave that probably went with the claim plate . It was partly cloudy when we left at 9 a.m . Had our first real tail wind , and tried to use the sail . Of course it alternated head and then tail winds all the way down the lake , with a confused swirl of water and air where it changed . Like every other day when we fought headwinds , I just kept singing " thank Heavens we are not on Lady Evelyn ! " <p> Mendolssohn was not really that pretty until you reach the end and look south you see rolling hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin , then a group of cabins , and then another single cabin , but they were all closed up tightly . We must have imagined the boat noises last night . Maybe it was a plane ? There were 4 old aluminum boats turned over at the entrance to Spay Creek . Did not see any sign of Haps " poor campsite " on the E. shore . <p> Three beaver dams with one big L/O before the portage , and the sun finally came out ! The creek got very shallow , with LOTS ( let me emphasize the LOTS ) of logs and branches on the bottom to scrap over . It was very narrow at times ( 6 - 7 ) at times , but the weeds always showed us which way the current was going , so it was easy to stay on the right branch . Saw 3 beaver lodges in use before the portage but the only wildlife was the deer and horse flies . Paddled the rest of the river in full bug gear , even shock cording our hands in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing me because of the haze . The haze turned out to be the bugs ! <p> The portage was fantastic ( even a wheelbarrow at either end ) . Lousy , shallow clay put in . Eight more beaver dams ( 5 L/O ) , with 4 of the dams currently being maintained . The lily pond was hard to see from the creek as marsh is filling it in . There were 3 more BDs after the pond , with 2 of them L/0 . There was one major blow-down/strainer that was obviously new , and will be a real pain down the road when more logs jam against it . Only 3 very large floating logs in front of it right now that we could move , then had to pull over a limb and force under the tree . Might be possible to do a portage on the marsh on river left ( maybe 10m ) . Need a good saw , gas axe or our friend Matty-with-his-axe to clean this up in the future . David was glad we were going downstream , which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept wondering if it would have been more enjoyable to do the trip in reverse then could really take the time to enjoy Maple Mountain , and sail down Lady Evelyn . ) <p> Lots of signs of moose , but still no Bullwinkle . One turtle , lots of ducks and loons , and something BIG that rushed out of the brush and into the river just after we passed . Slowed for a quick gorp/water break our first in 3 hours . Nice and sunny with clear paddling the rest of the day , with light tail winds as we reached Big Spring Lake . Entered the brown waters of the Montreal River and checked out some surveyors tape on river left to see if it was a site , but nothing there . At Indian Lake we saw two motor boats going up with the first people we had seen in 4 days . Campsite on the east-side of the island was not on the map . Flat and room for 1 tent , two if you moved the fire-pit ( used once , 12 little stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't  not find the small poor site on map found a spot that it might have been , covered in huge downed cedars . Big black clouds building in west , so decided to keep moving , even though we had 1-2 more days . This part of the Montreal River did not entice us to want to camp and swim . <p> Had an excellent cold Black Bean Salsa Soup in boat for lunch ( funny what you discover when you are a little generous with the water for rehydrating ) . We agreed that some nice toasted tortillas would go great with it , but it still made a good filling and spicy meal . After lunch I actually put the sunglasses on that I had been toting for the last week ! <p> South end of Indian Lake on the East side had road access lots of boats , cars and cabins . Would never be stuck if arriving here and could n't find the campsite on the island . Once back on the river , we saw only 1 cabin not in great shape , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible campsite just down past this cabin on river right . It was marked with a " 12 " sign . We saw an old metal wash bucket with a sapling growing through a teeny hole in the bottom . Tree would not let go so that I could right the bucket and set the tree free . Also saw huge cedars at same spot more than 1.5 m around . <p> Quite a boring river from this point on . Only 2 rocks , lots of loons , one nice red roofed cabin , and some birdhouses all over the marsh just before the logging bridge to divert your attention . Dawdled and enjoyed the sun from 1:45 p.m. to the take-out and tried to sail . Hit a head wind just after the bridge , as we turned to do the last 500m to Mowat Landing ! How fitting We took out at 4:30 after paddling 35 kms . <p> Talked to people who were putting in their motor boats to go camping for the weekend at the take-out . Found out the L. Evelyn in getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that competition for sites is great . They reassured us that the abnormal weather that we had had was nothing personal . High winds , cold , hail and rain everywhere all week , and yes , snow in Cochrane and Timmins . They all recommended the 20 min drive to New Liskeard to stay at the Waterfront Inn , which we did . Big , clean room , with full stove , sink , counter , dishes and pots ( $89 no discounts on weekends ) . Tried out the restaurant in the motel ( fantastic view down L. Timiskaming ) ; great Caesar salad , but disappointed in the ribs . Called home to check on Sandy and found out that he had figured out that if he dived onto the cats , they could not escape , and then he could get his hands on their fur ! Was glad to find out the he was not yet walking . <p> Sat . July 7 , 2001 <p> Had a great breakfast at a place on the Main Street called Norms Forum . Place was old but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for leaving a tip ! Drove down to N. Cobalt along 11B to the unsigned Hwy 567 . We followed Lakeview Ave . and the signs for Bucke Park and Camp Ground and found that the Devils Rock trail left from Bucke Park . Brisk 45 min. walk up on the easy trail to an amazing view of L. Timiskaming from 100m up . Came back on the hiking trail in 35 min , and was glad that we did as we were treated to more great views . <p> Would like to return to the area . Cobalt has some fantastic museums on mining , fire-fighting , the great fire of 1912 , a mining driving tour , and a cafT built over and beside a mine shaft . The fire tower in Temagami charges $2 , but it had several levels with interpretative displays . Iain would love it . Nice way to return to civilization slowly a little sight seeing before having to interact with people , and a little longer to enjoy each others company without little voices of interruption . It was only on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week we had not talked about the kids ( other than mooning a little over their pictures in the morning when we packed our wallets ) , mortgage , work or anything more stressful than events , history of the area , our books , and all the great things we were seeing and how lucky we were to be doing a trip like this . The topic of weather might have come up once or twice .. <p> Final Note : This was a great trip , and we look forward to doing it again . We have completed a detailed survey and mailed it off to the MNR , and hope our comments will help preserve this beautiful area . It is not as rugged as many parts of Temagami , but weather and time can change the conditions of an area drastically . Hap Wilson said in his book ( written 14 years ago ) that this route was novice to intermediate , with some difficult portages . Experienced people in good weather conditions would enjoy this route , but until trail markings are in place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me an advanced level trip . <p> If we did this trip again , we would put in on a Sunday night and take the first available site on Lady Evelyn or start first thing Monday morning and try to get off Lady Evelyn . This way we would avoid competing with the weekenders for sites . We would also either : a ) stay either on Sucker Gut ( 1-1.5 hour paddle to Maple Mountain ) . The next day we would climb Maple Mountain early in the day , and then head on to Anvil . Or b ) If the area appeared to be relatively un-busy , then we would try for Hobart Lake ( .5hr paddle to Maple Mt ) and count this as a layover day before moving on . <p> This trip can be done in 5 days not including the climb , if you are not wind-bound and you are willing to push yourself . It can also be done in the opposite direction . The nicest lakes for layover days would be Anvil , Greenwater , Skull and Mendolssohn , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( c ) 2002 John K. Wroe <p> We took the easy way to Maple Mountain . Hell , we realized at the put-in that wed forgotten the paddles , and it was only a half-hour delay . We are fortunate in that the east portal to the Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Wilderness Park is only about 15 minutes from our back door in Haileybury . Well , less if the river is calling and you do n't  have your paddles . <p> I must warn the serious canoe trippers that this is not a tale you are interested in . Darlene and I are built for comfort rather than speed , and comfort was the pre-requisite here . We had our old 15-foot Amik which is broad and deep and has the stability and load carrying capacity of barge . But it paddles better . Not a canoe you want to portage though , unless you 've got a lot of ( highly paid ) Voyageurs on staff . And on a big lake , it is just fine . <p> The eastern portal of the Wilderness Park is reached through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 , about 100 miles north of North Bay . This puts you onto the Montreal River , which you have to cross to get to the Lady Evelyn River , which ends about 30 feet above the Montreal . One can portage , but since the owner of the lodge at the Mattawapika Dam has a tractor and a wagon , the old and decrepit paddlers will spend the $10 ( round trip ) to save unloading and loading the canoe . <p> Above the dam we entered the Lady Evelyn River , really Lady Evelyn Lake , because the current is almost non-existent . We stopped for a snack after about an hour , just about where the river comes out of the main part of the lake . Heading west onto the main body of the lake , into the sunset , we suddenly realized we could see our target in the evening light , a broad purple band dominating the western horizon . Big . And we were still miles away . <p> We camped that night on some very strange esker remnants . Lady Evelyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned it into one , split somewhat into two by the Obisaga Narrows . The rough campsite we found was in the esker remnants on the south shore of the eastern lobe . These islands form something like an English country garden maze ; you have to look at the topo maps to appreciate it . <p> Day Two Next morning we threaded our way through the maze of channels , in crisp pure morning light and emerged onto the main lake , sticking close to the south shore in a growing westerly wind until we crossed to the north shore at Obisaga Narrows . The narrows funnels the wind , and the waves were building and a storm threatening so in the early afternoon we pulled into small island just to the west of the narrows and set up camp as the rain started . There is something vaguely pleasant about being storm-stayed . The island gave us lots of shelter from the wind , and we had a large tent and no shortage of supplies so sat out the next day as well , reading and poking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to a sunny morning and stopped for tea and cookies at Lady Evelyn Lodge , operated by some friends . We were also on a quest for air mattress repair ; leaky valves are really frustrating . We headed west again , just in time to run into another thunderstorm that rolled over the top of Maple Mountain . We took shelter on a small island , thinking we might be stuck for the night again , but after an hour or so of sheltering under our tarp the rain went away and we were able to head westward again , rounding the corner to turn south into Sucker Gut Lake . <p> We settled on a small island where Willow Island Creek flows into the lake . In the evening we spent some time trying to figure out what we were looking at on the water , finally realizing it was a pair of loons with two young ones , sometimes in the water , sometimes on their backs . <p> Day Five With just a day pack we headed out in the morning and saw an extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perched about 20 feet up a fir tree , and was being attacked by a pair of sparrowhawks , diving bombing while the heron sort of snapped at them . The best we could figure was that the heron had raided their nest . We continued up the creek , which we re-named Canoe Paint Creek in honour of all the canoes which had left their mark on the rocks in the stream bed . <p> We crossed Hobart Lake , then turned left into the creek to Tupper Lake , with a couple easy liftovers . We found the ruined ranger cabin where the trail starts , and started climbing . Well , actually , there was n't a lot of climbing at first , just casual ups and downs through a marshy hillside . After about half a mile climbing began in earnest , and then we met the girls . There was a group of about a dozen teenage girls in the middle of a 29-day trip that included James Bay and the Dumoine River , and one of them was in rough shape , suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain without adequate fluids . We donated a couple of oranges to the cause . <p> What brain-dead person was in charge of the victualling for this trip ? The hike up Maple Mountain is relatively simple , except for the last couple hundred yards . Apparently there is an easier trail around the south end , but we opted for the direct approach , which involves a bit of a nervous-making traverse across the east face of the ridge . The top is unbelievable . We were standing about 1,200 feet above the surrounding land , and the wind which was just a breeze down below was a constant , withering force . We could look around , and realized we could see up to 30 miles in any direction . It brought the vastness of Northern Ontario home to us . You will have heard the stories of clear-cutting of northern forests ; from our vantage point we could only identify a couple areas of clear-cut . Amazing . <p> We hung out on the crest for a couple hours , laying in the shelter of the shrubbery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what took us four days to achieve by water could be achieved in half an hour with a float plane . I suppose we should have been making love when the plane went over , just to make the point that although they could get there quickly , there was no way we they could actually be on top of the mountain . Other than the couple hundred yards of billy-goat scramble , the trip down was significantly easier than the trip up . We had , of course , forgotten the cork-screw , so the bottle of wine destined for the crest came back down with us . And although we could have been creative in the field of bottle opening , the thought of the billy-goat scramble while under the influence gave us reason to pause . <p> We got back to the campsite , where the wine and its destiny had their intersection . Day Six We packed in a liesurely manner in the morning , and headed north on Sucker Gut with a following wind . In a little cluster of islands we detected something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diving for clams . We stopped and watched for 15 minutes , but the wind was urging us onwards . We rounded the corner from Sucker Gut into Lady Evelyn and now our following wind was a cross-wind so we tried to stick to the south shore to avoid the waves , and we poked into a little corner that had been marked on our map , a cove about three-quarters of a mile west of where the lake opens out , and found a tiny tinkling waterfall . We were out of the wind and the waves , just tucked into this tiny corner with steep rock walls , and somewhere , underneath the brush , was a trickle of water from somewhere above . A priceless Temagami moment . <p> And then it was back onto the big lake and the turn to the northeast , and this friendly supporting wind was now kicking up significant swells , especially where the lake funnels into the Obisaga Narrows and we had no enthusiasm for that type of paddling , so we sought refuge on the little island where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morning found the wind reduced , but still significant . We paddled through Obisaga , then set a small sail for the eastward journey across the rest of Lady Evelyn , with a chop of maybe 18 inches . <p> We paddled with two Americans for a brief period ; we had met them at Mowatts Landing , where Lakeland Airways had picked them up to fly to Florence Lake , where they headed east down the South Lady Evelyn River . They were much better organized than us , and a little more efficient with their sailing techniques , so left us behind . It probably took us no more than three hours to get to the river outlet where we stopped for lunch and a swim , but we caught up to our American friends at Mitchells Camp at the Mattawapika Dam . They were busily packing their canoe for the portage ; Mr. Mitchell saw us and his wagon and tractor at the ramp and we were launched in the Montreal River first . I mean , for five bucks , at the end of a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I just bought the frozen ones pre-cooked and put them in the dehydrator . As stated they are quite tasty in a one pot meal . They do take some time to come back if you just want to eat them on their own . <p> However I suggest if you are using the frozen pre-cooked ones ( e.g. in the shrimp ring ) , that you sterilize them first by a quick boil . If they already have a bacteria load in them , ( which they probably do ) , then you would be incubating some really nasty stuff in the dehydrator . You will note on the package how they are very particular in the instructions about thawing them very quickly . That 's so you do n't provide lots of time in warm conditions to incubate a large load of bacteria and associated toxins . <p> Maybe using canned shrimp instead , ( which are probably cooked in the can ) , would be better ? <p> I have dehydrated the pre-cooked frozen shrimp which were defrosted quickly and rinsed thoroughly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seasonings with salt may help . I used Club House Lemon &amp; Herbs and lightly coate the shrimp before dehydrating .

@@107413520 @2813520/ 134053 @qwx994053 <h> Black Bears <p> On one hand , the sighting of a bear is cause for excitement . It 's a very real indication to us that we 've left the city behind and are now in a wilderness area . <p> However , when we encounter any animal large enough to potentially cause injury , there is an element of fear involved also . There 's always a bit of discomfort in knowing that we 're not necessarily at the top of the food chain , even if that possibility is very , very remote . <h> Range <p> Black bears inhabit most of mainland Canada with the exception of the far northern reaches of Ontario , Saskatchewan and Alberta and Prince Edward Island . <h> Breeding <p> Black bears mate in June or July , and cubs are born in January or February while the mother is still denning . A typical litter will consist of one or two cubs , and very occasionally litters of up to four . <p> Cubs are very small when compared to the size of the mother . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " long and weighs about half a lb . <p> Cubs leave the den with their mother in the spring and are quite active by this time . By the time they are one year old , they will weigh between 25 and 50 lb . <p> Food Sources <p> Bears range far and wide in search of food , and their eating habits do not discriminate against any type of food . They are true omnivores , eating whatever is available . <p> A great deal of their food supply is vegetation , including grass and leaves . They eat large quantities of berries and nuts , and insects such as ants , grubs and grasshoppers . Bears gather these insects using their strong claws to upturn rocks and logs . <p> Carrion is a particular favourite , and the more decomposed meat is , the more attractive it becomes . <p> Bears are not particularly good hunters , although their opportunistic style of food gathering means that they will readily eat birds , rodents and fish . Bears have also been known to prey on the calves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Perhaps because of an innate fear of bears , we tend to overestimate their weight and size . In fact , most female bears weigh between 100 and 150 lb. , and males seldom weigh more than 300 lb . Very rarely , males have been observed with weights up to 600 lb. and higher . <p> The name black bear is not entirely descriptive . Bears can exhibit a wide range of colours , from black to almost white . Most cubs will show the same colouring as their mother . <p> The ambling gait of black bears may give the impression that they are slow and clumsy , but they are in fact quite speedy when necessary . Bears have been clocked at speeds of up to 55 km/hr over short distances . Far from being clumsy , they are amazingly agile tree climbers , and can move through the underbrush in complete silence . As far as the old myth that bears ca n't run downhill ... forget it ! Black bears can run uphill , downhill and over flat ground with equal ease and agility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit islands in their travels . They are comfortable in swift water , and have been spotted swimming several kilometres from shore in large bodies of water . <p> Predators <p> Because of their strength and large size , adult bears have no real predators other than humans . Bear cubs will occasionally fall victim to wolves , lynx and older bears . <p> Behaviour <p> There are several bear behaviours which are commonly misunderstood . <p> The first is the act of standing up on the hind legs . Often perceived as threatening behaviour , it is actually related to the bear trying to get a better view and scent of an object , person or animal . It is more a gesture of curiosity than of aggression . <p> Another is the act of charging . These charges are almost always " bluff charges , " intended to demonstrate the bear 's fear and desire to have the perceived threat leave the area . It is very rare that a bear would follow through on one of these bluff charges and actually make contact with a person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently into wilderness areas will vouch for the fact that black bears are quiet , shy and do their best to avoid contact with humans . A bear sighting in the wilderness is not all that common . <p> Despite of this , bears are intelligent animals , and can quickly become habituated to human presence . They learn that human food is an easy source of nutrition , and can therefore become a nuisance . Bears congregate around landfill sites because of the easy availability of food , and can also learn to steal canoeists food packs . <p> The danger of bear-human encounters is most often greatly exaggerated . Hundreds of thousands of these encounters take place every year in North America , and injuries and fatalities are so rare as to be of little concern .

The trail goes up and down some good size hills . As the trail is not used much , it is overgrown and hard to follow in a few spots . There are only afew spots to access the river to shorten the portage if water conditions permit running the bottom portion . All considered , its just a hard Try to plan this portage first thing in the day or your last one .

You may want to allow an extra day for this section of the trip . Campsites are few and far between . Until you reach Ivanhoe Lake there is not too much traffic and it is quite peaceful . Keith Sinfield Capreol , Ontario <p> Capsule reflections of the Pish . By David G. Pile While on balance ( no pun intended ) a positive experience , the route had drawbacks in addition to the one long portage . In early July , 1997 , the water level was higher than normal and we made good progress and were able to paddle some sections which might need lining or walking were the trip done at a different time . Also , we missed some landmarks provided by our outfitter due to the water level . We were looking forward to the challenge of " Run and Duck " , but realized at a lunch break that we missed it due to the water level and the force of the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to the group camaraderie and fairly typical reasons folks take such trips , would include the Chapleau area which is not as busy as other canoe destinations . Being away from major population centers makes the river systems less traveled , and the ish is certainly not well traveled . The portages around unrunnable rapids or falls are , with the one notable exception , short . Certainly shorter than many other routes . The trip can be undertaken by those with average wilderness and canoe skills . Your " average " may be different . Our party had members in a wide range of condition , including someone who had heart surgery in the past . This route has a few places which enable playtime in the rapids and one set of rapids had a portage trail which provided good views of the canoes running the rapids , virtually from top to bottom . Several of the campsites were quite nice and provided space for more tents than our group needed . The 6 of us pitched 3 2-person Sierra Designs dome tents .. Drawbacks : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " fishing camps " , there is some presence of fishing on several lakes and stretches of the Ivanhoe River . Cabins have been built at several spots and the likelihood of hearing and seeing float planes dropping off or picking up guests is high . I feel a bit let down knowing that I have paddled for hours or days to reach the same spot which now I must share with someone who only recently stepped out of a Beaver or Cessna floatplane . The last day of the trip , during the long paddle up Ivanhoe Lake toward the Provincial Park , noise from both the highway and rail line can be heard in the distance . Not significant , but it is noticeable and obviously the reason many of us take canoe trips is to get away from such reminders of the city . With the route seldom traveled , little is done in the way of upkeep so blow downs may cause some problems along portage trails or in narrow sections of the river . The condition of the campsite at the upstream end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , but I would stay at this site in an emergency only . Our group was planning on staying at this location , but having made better than expected time and arriving at mid-day , we only stopped long enough to put on bug repellent , eat a quick lunch and then push on for 2 hours and 45 minutes to the other end . Do n't  count on enjoying a stay at the upstream end of the trail . The downstream end was missed as we took the left fork to shorten the route by approximately 1/3 . As we paddled by the portage sign we noted that the trail ended near a gravel bar but the actual condition of the campsite is unknown to us . There is some evidence of the hunters who have done some campsite " upgrading " with the typical post and beam or sapling and nail construction . This is especially true of the nice campsite at the confluence of the Pish and Ivanhoe Rivers . The large campsite has a framework over which plastic sheeting is erected during the hunting season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clothesline for one team of paddlers who had dumped up river earlier . Summary : Would I paddle the route again ? Probably not , but not because it was not enjoyable . There are so many other routes and locations which draw my attention and I want to enjoy new places . If there were no cabins , float planes and a few more rapids to play in , I 'd repeat the trip , including the long portage . After all , the highlight of any trip is the mind which takes it all in , whether one is absorbing wildlife , fellow paddlers , the scenery or , in the case of some of our group , absorbing moisture from one of those navigational errors in judgement .

Pile Cleveland , Ohio <p> The Pishkanogami canoe route follows the Kinogama and Ivanhoe rivers for 105 kilometres from the once thriving , but now deserted , town of Kormak , to Ivanhoe Lake Provincial Park near Folyet on Highway 101 .

This area is due to be logged over the next few years so now is the perfect time to visit this relatively untouched wilderness . <p> Sat July 19th <p> After waving Archie and my truck good bye I turned towards the Kinogama River where my canoe and gear were strewn about on the ground . The grass leading down to the river had been flattened as if another boat had recently been launched - perhaps I would n't be alone after all . I loaded the gear into the boat and slid it down the bank and into the water . <p> It had been a hot dry summer so consequently water levels were really low and at first glance the Kinogama did n't  look like much of a river . After paddling about 50 meters it looked considerably less so . II was met by a seemingly impenetratable wall of cattails . It took about a half an hour to push , pull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain 300 meters of river . I was beginning to rethink my choice of route and wondering - " what am I going to do if the rest of the river is like this " . <p> The river then opened up into a small lake that was also choked with weeds but at least there was a small channel through them . Swimming along beside me about 50 meters to my left was bear #1 of the trip . As soon as he spotted me he took off for the far shore . Soon I was in the river , which was marshy , full of small log jams and beaver dams requiring a lift over every 100 to 150 meters . The river was passable but not easy and I remember thinking " What am I going to do if the whole trip is like this ? Ill never be done in 5 days ! " <p> I started looking for the first carry - a 500 meter portage on river left that goes up over a hill and into a small lake before rejoining the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marsh . I was beginning to really worry that I had missed it when I saw a bit of a landing and a broken off tree with a small blaze carved on it . This must be the place ! There was fresh vegetation tramped down with tracks heading off in about 5 directions , no doubt made by the people I assumed were in front of me . I followed them all for 10 -15 feet and discovered what their makers had - there was no portage here . I had wasted a half hour and gotten my legs scratched , all for nothing . If I ever catch the Boy Scout who carved that blaze , I 'll .... <p> Anyway , now that I knew where the portage wasnt . There remained the task of finding where it was . I got back into the boat , paddled 10 meters , lifted over a small beaver dam and continued on for about another kilometer . I had to repeat this operation a few more times before I came to an impenetrable jumble of logs , trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no signage and little evidence of a path but this must be the take out . I hauled the boat out onto the soft muddy bank and sure enough , there was a faint trail with only some old moose tracks in it , heading into the forest . I picked up one of the bags and the water jug and headed inland . <p> I got about 20 meters when all semblance of a path disappeared . To say that he trail was overgrown was an understatement . What a jungle ! ! I stumbled around deadfalls and the jumble of undergrowth trying to keep the trail in sight . Many times I lost it , then found it again , all the while working my way steadily up the incline . After about 300 meters , I got to the top where there was a clearing , thick with mosquitoes and deer flies . Repellent works fine for the mosquitoes but the deer flies were treating it as an aphrodisiac . II could see why these things can drive people insane . I looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . I 'd have to remember to put long pants on when I got back to the boat . The bigger problem was that the trail had disappeared . II searched for 20 minutes with no luck and was beginning to get very worried . What if this was not the portage and only some game trail ? Where was the trail then ? I had to fight back the feeling of panic that was starting to set in . <p> There was nothing to do but work my way back to the boat and see if I could find another way . Another fifteen minutes of pushing through the underbrush saw me back at the boat searching up and down the river bank for another path - all to no avail . The path I had been on had to be the one . I put on long pants , a long sleeved shirt , picked up the water jug and started back up the path . About half way to the clearing I noticed some old blue flagging tape on a tree , furthering my determination that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing , but this time I started a calmer , more methodical search and was rewarded by finding another piece of the flagging tape on a small fallen tree . This gave me a starting point for the search and within a few minutes I had found it again . The trail was difficult to follow and I lost it a couple of times but I finally emerged from the bush onto an old logging road . I knew that the trail crossed this road because nailed to a big tree on the other side was a big shiny yellow portage sign ! ( absolutely fabulous place for it , eh ? ) . <p> The trail started down a steep hill and I could see water down there , so I knew that I had finally made it through . It occurred to me that people may be accessing this route from this road and if I ever do this route again I will definitely check this out . Now that I knew that I was n't lost , the work of getting the gear across could begin . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . I usually make a carry in 2 trips , but in these conditions I knew this was out of the question . Two trips later , I had all the baggage across but I was getting tired and still had the boat to carry . I plodded back towards the boat , doing a little more housekeeping on the trail . Upon arriving back at the boat , I remember wishing that I had an apple in my pocket but since I did n't  , a 5 minute rest would have to do . I shouldered the boat and started up the path but did n't  get far before I had to put it down . There just was n't enough room above me in this jungle to carry it , so I ended up dragging it a lot of the way . Thank God for ABS . Finally , physically drained and emotionally exhausted , the boat was full of gear and had water under her . I could n't help thinking " what am I going to do if all the portages are like this ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was broken on this portage and I keep wondering " What happened to the people in the phantom boat that I was following ? " I never saw another trace of them ! I had originally planned to paddle as far as the campsite on Tooms Lake but given my physical condition that was now out of the question . Thankfully there was a spot on the north end of this little lake about 1 kilometer away . Fifteen minutes of paddling saw me pulled up on a small sand beach unloading the boat and setting up camp on the large airy site .

I was sound asleep in my tent . <p> Sun July 20th <p> By 8:00 am I was up and about getting the coffee brewed .

It was a nice camping spot , though . The river sped up through here for 500 meters or so , then slowed back down . From that point to Sawbill lake the river widened so deadfalls were not a big problem . They were seldom long enough to block the entire width of the river . You were , however forced to take a very zig-zag route to get around them . <p> It was quite marshy there and there were many ducks .

It was a matter of minutes before I had a nice dinner-sized walleye . It had taken five hours to paddle to the campsite at the north end of the lake and because of the deteriorating weather ( as well as all the portages ) I decided to camp here . It was a good choice - a big sunny spot , lots of firewood and even a lawn chair . I got the rain fly up just as the rain started . It rained off and on all night . Not pouring ... more of a heavy fog , but everything was soaked the next morning just the same . <p> Monday , July 21 <p> I waited til 10:30 am. to give the weather time to start clearing and then headed out . It was n't long before I got to the rapids at P-2 ( 100m ) . It was a small drop with some beaver workings at the start that required a liftover . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P-3 ( 60m ) . These rapids were shallow and rocky and I lined them without incident . A short paddle brought me to P-4 ( 200m ) . This carry bypassed 2 sets of rapids and fit into the " must-carry " category . The adventurous could run the first set fairly easily to a secondary take-out ( unmarked ) just above the second drop which is totally unrunable . The paddler will have to decide for himself if the risk is worth the bother to bypass just 100 meters of trail . Since I was travelling solo , I did not want to risk a swim and get swept into the second drop , so I carried the whole portage . <p> Soon I got to P-5 ( 340m ) on the left , which avoid what the guide describes as " rapids with a strong current " . The start looked deceptively easy and with the low water levels I decided to run and line it . After the first 75 meters the river curves to the right and this is where the trouble started . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lots of logs across it for good measure . It took me an hour and a half to get through it - across slippery rocks , over and under logs and then wading a shallow gravel / boulder bar at the bottom . Never again - this should be listed as " must carry " as I cant imagine running it at any water level . In high water , it would be a lot like a " slide ride " , but without the smooth soft sides . <p> A short paddle brought me to P-6 ( 60m ) This rapid was short and easy and I ran it without incident . Following closely on the right comes P-7 ( 70m ) . This run has been dubbed " run and duck " because of the low hanging cedars across the river . I think that time has lowered these trees , since I could n't imagine getting a canoe under some of them . Further complicating this run is the formation of a log jam about 20 meters upstream that is too unstable to stand on safely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around this obstacle , I seriously recommend carrying the entire portage . Its only 70 meters and avoids a potentially DANGEROUS situation . <p> The river then widened into Halcrow Lake . The outlet came shortly on the right and soon narrowed for a short distance before opening up again into a small lake . On the north shore half way down this lake , there was a nice large campsite situated on a small point of land . Continuing on for another kilometer or so , the river narrowed again and soon arrived at to P-8 ( 65m ) . The rapids here were short and steep . In high water they are likely a fun ride , but with the low water conditions on this trip , the decision to carry around them was easy . Along this section there was one small unmarked rapid as well as a low ledge . Both were easy to run and the only danger is being caught unawares by them . <p> After this , the river turned north and came to P-9 ( 20m ) that all canoeists must use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire river . It is just a short liftover in low water conditions . From here the river meandered slowly northward until it reached Vice Lake . It was in this section , where the river opens up into a marshy area that I came upon moose number 2 of the trip . Where the first one had been an ordinary - even ratty looking , small bull , this fellow was everything a moose should be . A magnificent bull in his prime that had the biggest rack of antlers I had ever seen . I imagine he will be very popular with the ladies this fall . <p> One of the highlights of the trip , a nine meter high falls is found at the north end of Vice Lake . As you approach the falls the granite walls start to rise upward and then close in , forming a gorge that squeezes the river down to about 20 feet wide at the lip of the falls . The 135 meter portage on the left starts up a steep rocky incline for 50 meters and then descends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide shows 2 campsites here -one at the start of the carry and the other near the end .

It was 5:30 pm so I set up camp quickly and had supper and was cleaned up by the time the sun was sinking below the trees . <p> The gorge looked like a great fishing spot so I got out the gear and looked over my tackle selection . I picked out a silver and pink flatfish that I had been carrying around for years - had never used it - never intended to use it ! I did n't  even know where it came from , but I thought to myself " todays the day ! " With the lure attached to my line , I climbed down to the water and casted .

I took a nasty cut on the finger from the sharp edge of his gill when he started flopping around . Moments later , the hooks were out and he was revived and swimming away . I fished for another 20 minutes and never got another nibble - probably just beginners luck for that lure . <p> Tuesday , July 22 <p> The morning dawned crisp and sunny and I was packed up , fed and on the river by 8:00 am . The direction of the river here formed an almost complete box before heading north again . There was little relief here and the area was myriad of large and small lakes all joined by easily navigable channels - in short , a fishermans paradise . I heard a few float planes coming and going but they only momentarily disturbed the solitude . <p> Before long the river turned northward again and narrowed between rocky hills . P-11 ( 360m ) soon appeared on the left and bypassed a fast shallow rapids . You have to be part mountain goat to do this carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so before levelling out and then descending slowly to the finish . I carried half the gear over and had a good look at the rapids below - the view was fabulous . I did n't  like the idea of lugging the boat and the other pack up that hill , so I decided , with a lot of apprehension ( it was a solo trip after all ) to make the run . There were 2 drops near the top that required good braces to make it through and then an easy stretch before coming to the chute near the bottom . The main chute on the right had a freshly fallen sweeper in it , so I took the eddy on the left and waded the boat through on the left side . All in all a fun , if slightly scary ride . Immediately following this portage came P-12 ( 100m ) and P-13 ( 70m ) , both on the right . They bypassed small easy rapids which were no problem to run . <p> The river from here meandered a couple of kilometers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a huge campsite here and one a bit smaller downriver about 1 kilometer . The second one was a fair climb from the river and of the two campsites , the first is by far the best . <p> Further downstream , the slow moving Ivanhoe opened up into a long narrow lake with another campsite marked in the guide as being directly across from the outlet . I had planned to camp here but I never did find it . What I did find in ( or near ) its place was a five star fly-in lodge , so I decided to continue on to the next spot - 5 km further on at the end of the next portage . <p> Bear number two was sighted 750 m from the start of the carry but one look at me and he ran into the bush . P-14(360m) iwa on the left and was a level , easy path that circumvented a rapid that dropped in two stages . The first drop was not too difficult . The guide mentions a secondary take out before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw little sign of it as it was heavily grown over . The second drop was an S-bend complete with rocks that have not been placed properly . If you decide to run this rapid , scout it well first . It was 4:30 and I was very tired , so I decided to take the portage trail - I would carry the gear over first , set up camp , eat and then go back at my leisure and get the boat . After just a few feet into the carry , there was evidence that the bear had recently been on this side of the river - a freshly dug up bees nest . The bees were still buzzing around , no doubt wondering what had happened to destroy their world and I did n't  hang around long enough to get blamed . <p> The campsite at the end of the carry had room for only a couple of tents but was one of those idyllic spots that you do n't  come across often enough . It had a huge flat slab of granite that juts out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could sit and watch the fire and as a backdrop , look upstream and watch the fires reflection in the water as it tumbled over the rocks in the deepening twilight . <p> Four days into the trip and I was filthy and would have had trouble talking a wet dog into sitting next to me . I needed a bath ! Down to the river with water jugs , pots and boat bailer to get wet and then collect water for the rinse cycle . Up by the campsite - there I was -stark naked and covered in suds ( an unusual sight at best , I assure you ) and I looked across the river to see that I was being scrutinized by bear number three ( or perhaps number two again - its tough to tell without name tags ) . I pointed to where I wanted him to go and yelled at him and off he went . The poor bear is still probably still haunted to this day wondering just what that pink sudsy thing was . <p> I keep my food in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food scraps and garbage and have never had any problem with bears , even sows with cubs . I do n't  know why , but bears in the wild seem scared shitless of humans . <p> Wednesday , July 23 <p> Today was going to be the big day - the reason you eat all the heavy stuff first . It was portage day . An hours paddle down river was P-15 ( 400m ) followed closely by the biggie - P-16 ( 3 km ) . On the way to the first rapid I kept thinking to myself how nice it would be if I could run or at least line it so as to preserve some much needed energy for the long one . <p> When I got to the portage take out I saw that it was one of those shitty ones full of jagged rocks . I paddled over to the top of the rapid and had a look down it . It was steep and fast ! About 100 meters down , just after some cube van sized rocks , it disappeared around a bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurking beyond that . I thought maybe I could run it carefully down to the corner , get out and line it from there but I was n't liking this idea much better than the rocky take out . I paddled back over to the portage , got out and paced around glaring at the rocky shore . I decided to give it a try . I got back into the boat and headed for the start of the run . It was a decision I would soon regret . <p> Minutes later I was over the lip and heading downhill . It always amazes me , that at times like this , time seems to speed up and things happen a lot faster than they should . It seemed like only seconds before I was nearing the bend . I saw that there were no eddies so I started paddling furiously backward hoping to back into some slacker water near shore . That 's when I hit the rock with the left side of the boat which sent it corkscrewing into the air and it was almost upside down as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The barrel and the dry bag bounced out as well and started their run to freedom but everything else was fastened to the boat and stayed put . After bouncing for a few feet into slower water , I stood up , grabbed the boat and waded to shore . I carefully lifted the boat up and out of the water and then flipped it right side up back onto the water . I threw my paddle into it and then looked downstream for my gear . The dry bag had snagged on a rock a few meters down but the barrel was still bouncing merrily towards the end of the rapid . Retrieving it would be no problem . The rapid flows into a large pool and the wind was blowing in the right direction so it would drift into a large bay on the right . <p> So far , things were going almost according to plan . I was , after all at the bend in the river and ready to line the boat the rest of the way down . The fifteen pounds of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as adventure . Looking back to the river , I saw that lining this was going to be difficult but not impossible . The main channel roared down the right side of the river , dividing a few times into two or three secondary channels . The trick was going to be finding a way through the many little channels through the rocks on the left side . I worked my way slowly down river , collected my dry bag and dragged the boat over some rocks to get around the left side of those cube van sized boulders . It was slow work but I was steadily making progress . After fifteen minutes there remained only one more difficult spot and the worst would be over . <p> By now , I was almost in the middle of the river , sometimes jumping , sometimes wading between the rocks and would now have to go through one of the secondary chutes that was splitting from the main flow . Just as the boat was entering this chute , I slipped on an algae covered rock and lost control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boat hit a rock , stopping its forward motion . The force of the water pulled the upstream gunwale down into the water , swamping it instantly . Now sideways and full of water , the current pinned it against rocks at both the bow and stern . It took some moments for my brain to fully comprehend the impact of the scene in front of me and I could only stare in disbelief . My brain was cycling through many emotions finally ending with ... " What am I going to do now ? " It took a few minutes to wade my way down to the boat and after reaching out and pulling up on the bow , my arms told me what my eyes already knew - this boat was n't going anywhere soon . <p> I had to fight the urge to try and do everything at once - I had to approach this with a plan and carry it out one step at a time . The first step would be to gather all my gear and be ready to set up camp at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat should prove unrecoverable . When the boat swamped , the dry bag and my paddle were set adrift again . Everything else - day pack , camera case , spare paddle , portage yoke and bailer were still attached to the boat , but the way they were thrashing around it the current , it was anybodys guess how long they would stay that way . All I could do was hope for the best . Getting the boat back minus the paddles or yoke was n't going to do me much good . I swam and waded through the pool below the boat to where the bag had pinned on the rocks and using it for stability , waded the remaining 200 meters to the bottom of the rapid . To get to the portage I had to wade across the main flow in water 2 to 3 feet deep , terrified of getting one of my feet trapped between the rocks and falling over . It was a good thing that the river fanned out a bit at the bottom , but even then I 'm not sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag for stability . <p> Now I at least had the tent , bedding and dry clothes safe and I focused my mind on what to do next . I checked on the barrel and saw that it was still over on the far side of the pool and going nowhere . I had been in the water for about three quarters of an hour now and was getting sick of it so I started walking up the portage trail . When I thought I was even with the boat , I bushwacked over to the river to see if there was any chance of rescuing it from this side . Most of the current here went along the right bank and I saw that there was no way I would be able to wade across this raging water with a rope . If the boat was to be recovered , it would have to be from the other side . <p> Back at the trails end , I was getting ready to go after the barrel when I looked up towards the boat and saw my " pelican " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to bring it very close to me , so I only had to wade out a few feet to scoop it up as it went by . It had had a rough ride down the river , so I was a little apprehensive as I opened it up . The equipment inside was undamaged and bone dry . I really like it when gear justifies its cost by performing the way it was designed to . <p> I started to walk around the pool towards the barrel . It had to be next on the recovery list as it contained , in addition to the food , the equipment I would need to rescue the canoe . I did n't  get far before the ground turned into a black oozy boot sucking muck that I would have to wade through . I thoroughly hate this disgusting shit . God knows what slithery , wormy , blood-sucking life forms are evolving in it . I gave serious consideration to eating bark and leaves until I was rescued . God , I hate this shit ! You try to find sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so deep , but you then risk slipping and falling in , making a bad situation far worse . Who wants to land on their face in this ooze ? It took a three quarters of an hour to make it over to the barrel and the same amount of time to walk back , sometimes sinking to mid thigh . I almost lost a boot a few times . <p> Finally back at the end of the portage , and after washing the goo off , I ate some lunch and thought of ways to get the boat back . The usual way this is done is to attach a rope to the boat and using carabiners to fashion a pulley , haul the boat off against the current . This method works best with lots of muscle helping to haul on the rope - muscle I did n't  have . I could n't get a rope across the river in any case because of the strong current . I decided that the best chance I would have , would be to try and pry the boat off with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the main channel to get to the other side of the river . I was starting to get scared of this river . <p> I got the saw and some rope out of the barrel , wrapped the rope around me , cut a long staff and started across . I used the staff as a third leg to help me through the fast water and like a cane to keep me from falling over the slippery rocks as I waded resolutely upstream . At this point , I really did n't  have a lot of faith that this was going to work but since my dance card was empty anyway ... As I neared the boat I came across a pole , about eight feet long and five inches in diameter - just the perfect size . To wade out to the boat , I had to cross two small chutes and wiggle between a couple of big boulders at the top of the pool that was just below the boat . Once out there , I was in a calm spot with water boiling past me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . Luck was with me in that there was a submerged rock under the boat and just in front of the rock that the bow was pinned against . I got the pole into position using this rock as a fulcrum and placed my weight on it and pushed down - the pole snapped in half like a piece of balsa wood . <p> I was just beginning to think that this might just work - but what now ? I needed a stronger pole and looking around me , I saw a stand of birch trees about 20 meters up river . One of them would do nicely . I waded back to the shore , picked up the saw and started to push my way through the nearly impenetrable bush along the shore . Once at the clump of trees , I assembled the saw and started to work and ten minutes later , I had a solid pole eight feet long and five inches thick . Back at the boat , with renewed confidence that this was going to work , I positioned the pole and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid up and off the rock and the whole boat started slowly corkscrewing and turning in the current and started to float downstream . It did n't  get far before it stopped - no apparent reason - it just stopped and hung there wallowing from side to side in the current . The front painter must have worked loose and was now wedged in between some rocks , keeping the boat from floating free of the chute . <p> Cutting the rope would quickly solve the problem ( that is , if I had a knife , which I did n't  ) so I waded out through the chest high water and snagged the boat on one of its trips to my side of the chute . Working it into slower water allowed me to pull it upstream slightly to ease the strain on the rope and with my other hand , I worked to untie the rope . The knot in the wet rope had really tightened so it was quite a job to undo it with one hand - but finally it was free and I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling the boat behind me until I had some better footing under me and the took stock of what I had . The spare paddle was hanging by a thread - it would not have been long before it would have been lost , but the portage yoke and bailer were still secure . The day bag however was gone - its a gym bag that I carry all the things that I want handy such as rain wear , binoculars etc . The contents were quite valuable and I hoped that I would find it wedged on a rock downstream and that it was n't gone for good . I still , of course had the problem of getting a ton of water out of the boat and back into the river where it belonged . <p> I was perched precariously on two rocks in chest deep water - combine that with a gimpy right arm , and I was not even going to try emptying it by lifting it up and out of the water . That left bailing - not as easy as it sounds . An ABS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to get it floating evenly with the gunwales just out of the water and then bailing like mad before a small wave comes along that rolls over the gunwales and refills the boat with water , forcing you to start over . This happened twice but eventually I started making headway . I had no idea that a canoe held this much water , and removing it , half a javex bottle at a time , is sure hard on the arm . Finally the boat was empty enough to start downstream , so I pushed off across the pool and towards shore intending to collect my saw and rope and be on my way . I was half way across when the current grabbed the boat and tried to twist it from my grasp , which wrenched my sore shoulder causing it to scream out in agony - but by now , nothing could cause me to let go of this boat . <p> Once on shore , I had to sit and wait fifteen minutes for the pain to subside enough for me to pick up my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easy - I even found my day bag half way down - it was in bad need of drying out but the only thing damaged was my tape recorder that was in a zip-lock bag that had leaked . I had been working for over three hours in deep fast flowing water , fearful that one slip could have caused death from entrapment or some broken bones from an unscheduled swim and I felt a great sense of relief that this ordeal was over . <p> I was soon loaded up and after a scan for the missing paddle ( never did find it ) , and one last look upstream , I was on the way to the next portage . Along the way , I had lots to think about . I had made many mistakes , but I realised that the root cause of this particular bit of adventure was that I had lost all perspective about why I was here in the first place . I had allowed myself to become so worried about the next rapid , that I did n't  pay the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destination and not the journey . I vowed that this was one mistake I will never make again . <p> A fifteen minute paddle brought me to the next , last and biggest portage . I had originally thought that it could be avoided by wading , lining and careful running , but now I was thinking " perhaps next time " Who am I kidding - the decision not to run it was made about two hours ago . <p> The portage was 3 km long , but only the first 1.5 km is considered a " must carry " . There is a put in at the half way point for those who want to run the last half of the rapid , which is what I planned to do . The guide showed a campsite at the start of the carry , but it was so small that it should be classified as an emergency spot at best . The trail left the river and starts off level , but after 100 meters , began to climb . Over the next 300 meters , I climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The trail then levelled off for 200 meters , before returning to the river . It then turned to the right along the brow of a steep hill which gave a fabulous view of the river , over a hundred feet below . From up there anyway , it did n't  look like such a tough run . For the last 800 meters , the trail followed the side of this winding esker and worked its way slowly downhill until I was walking on the flat river bank . Overall the trail is in good condition , with a well defined easy to follow treadway and only a few deadfalls to detour around . The turn off at the halfway point was easy to find as this path gets far more traffic than the one that continued on to the end of the portage . <p> Now came one of the highlights of the trip - 1.5 km of C-1 rapids . The only catch was that because of the low water , I had to wade the loaded boat out into the main channel to begin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portage trail had finally dried my boots out and I had dry feet at last ( well , for five minutes anyway ! ) This was a fun ride that wound its way along the esker until the river finally ran out into Ivanhoe Lake . The guide also showed a campsite at the end of the portage but I did n't  see it . What I did see as I whizzed by was a boulder beach with what looked like a big clearing farther back , up on the river bank . <p> Shortly after this on the left , there was a long flat bank about 5 feet above river level that could be used as a campsite if needed . I was getting really tired , but wanted to make the next nice large campsite , which was 5 km further down the lake . The lake was perfectly calm and it was an enjoyable one and a half hour paddle in spite of my fatigue . Once there , I had plenty to do , setting things out to dry in addition to the regular camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in just as darkness was descending . In spite of all the memories of the days events racing through my mind , sleep overtook me almost instantly . <p> Thursday , July 23 <p> Ivanhoe lake is 36 kilometers long and because there are no developed campsites , has to be paddled in one day . The lake is aligned in a southwest - northeast direction which lines it up well with the summer prevailing wind - a wind I hoped would be in my favour . Travelling solo into a strong wind is difficult at best , so I had decided that I would not attempt the long paddle today , unless the wind was in my favour . I was up at dawn , watching the morning mist rising off the water to see if it would give me an idea as to which way the wind would blow today . The mist would start to drift downstream a little causing my spirits to soar , then soon begin swirling upstream , causing me to fret . This pattern continued for about an hour and then , slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... downstream . I was packed and on my way within half an hour . <p> For the next 3 hours a gentle breeze helped my paddle propel me down the lake but the breeze was starting to pick up and was soon blowing quite briskly . This lake , while generally long and thin opens up into wide spots then narrows into small channels that soon lead to wider sections again - a pattern that continues for about 30 kilometers , after which , it then opens up into a large round body of water , 4 kilometers across . To get an image in your mind , picture a giant tadpole with a 4 kilometer diameter head and a 36 kilometer tail . <p> The wind was starting to cause problems on the wide sections , kicking up waves as large as a third of a meter . It was nothing really dangerous , but the situation required constant attention . I was meeting people now and then - the odd fishermen and some tourists at the few outpost cabins that were scattered along the shoreline . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big part of the lake , I had been paddling non stop for 7 hours , and my legs , arms and back were screaming for a rest and a chance to stretch . My bladder was also getting very insistent , so landing at the campsite for a walkabout seemed like a great idea . <p> It wasa nice big spot and not a bad place to spend my last night on the river , especially if the wind would make the lake crossing too dangerous . Fifteen minutes later , revived and refreshed , I was back in the boat and heading towards the last leg of the trip - the main lake crossing . I was entering the lake on the lee side , so the water was calm on this side , but out in the centre , I could see whitecaps - a place to definitely avoid . To make the crossing , I headed along the south shore towards a long promontory that extends out from the south shore for about one and a half kilometers - It took half an hour to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this far out . In these deepening swells , I let the wind supply most of the forward power and I concentrated more on keeping the boat at ninety degrees to the waves . Some of these waves were now approaching two thirds of a meter in height and I did not want to broach and get swamped . Once past the spit , I slipped in behind it and finished the crossing in its wind shadow . As I neared the beaches on the other side , the waves were again getting rather large but this concerned me far less than the fact that the wind had forced me to take a course that brought me ashore 1 kilometer south of Red Pine Lodge where my truck was parked ( I hoped ) . Twenty minutes later after a sideways roller coaster ride through the waves , I was on the beach in front of the lodge - I was home ! ! <p> My truck was there , complete with a flat tire . After getting the tire filled and everything packed up and loaded , I drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the night , before the long drive home in the morning . As dusk was approaching , I took a walk down to the lake for one last look . The water now was as calm as a sheet of glass and reflected in it was a magnificent magenta sunset - it was a perfect ending . 
@@107413533 @2813533/ <p> Met at " The Place " for trip briefing , gear check , food list , food shopping and fishing tackle arrangement . Mary presented each of us with a T-shirt designed especially for the trip . It read : " Les Six Voyageurs de Michigan " . We packed two food packs . Mary Jo , Tom , Milt , and Mary packed one personal pack per couple plus a smaller nap sack per couple for small stuff . Helene and I each packed a frame pack for their personals and carried camp gear , cook kit , water purifier , and first-aid kit . The goal was to make portages in one trip . Packs weighed in at 40-50 lbs . each . <p> Sunday July 18 <p> Four thirty comes early and the alarm always rings louder . We loaded gear into Mary Jos Explorer with canoes on top , two 17 Grummans . A cooler for car food and the first nights river dinner was also loaded . Drove to Whitmores where Milt had three slices of bacon ready for us that were one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We departed Whitmores at 7:03 AM and arrived in Mattice at 9:30 PM 618 miles later . The drive was a leisurely one with speeds ranging between the limit and +6 . We stopped six or seven times , twice for sit down meals . <p> The drive is beautiful up to White River and north up HWY 631 where the scenery changes to scrub brush . HWY 11 is downright ugly , flat and swampy . The town of Hearst is much larger than we expected with a lumbering town population of about 6000 and 600 restaurants , a slight exaggeration . Mattice , just to the east of Hearst , is a small community about the size of our Onekama , MI . Saturday night we stayed a Shallow Lake Missinaibi Outfitters owned and operated by Owen and Denise Korpela <p> We stayed in a double-wide trailer cabin , a part of Owen and Denises business . Milt and Mary were also renting a canoe from Owen . The place is perfect for paddlers like us . We were treated like family the moment we arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our double-wide if she had known that there were women along in the group . We laughed and wondered what other arrangements she would have made because it was already more than we expected , complete with hot showers and a TV that received TWO channels ..... AAH ! The last luxuries . <p> Monday July 19 ... The Initiation <p> Awake at 6:30 AM . We went to have breakfast at " Nancys Truck Stop " bar/restaurant , an outhouse sized roadside eatery . When we found it was closed and pulled back out onto the highway a man flagged us down and explained that they were moving and instructed us to , " Go to that building over there and follow me through the back door and well fix you right up . " Later we learned that Denise had called and told him that we were coming . The mostly French speaking waitress came to our table and explained that due to the move their menu was limited to eggs , as was her English vocabulary . Mary got a more detailed description of the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Michigan ) Community Schools . When breakfast came we learned that the eggs are served just one way , two of them over easy . We were delighted to see the eggs also served with bacon , potatoes , toast , and coffee . It was the perfect start to the first paddling day of our trip . <p> When we returned to Owen and Denises place , they showed us a video of the trip that Owen made in June when he paddled the river to clear the portage trails of the winters deadfalls . This preview of the trip helped whet our appetites for the adventure at hand . <p> We dilly-dallied around until about 1:45 PM before actually pushing off . Owen delivered us , our canoes , and gear to the river just downstream of the HWY 11 bridge crossing . With hand shakes all around we paddled off downstream . This section of the Missinaibi surprised us with its breadth , about 100 yards wide . The initial paddling is rather mundane which allowed us to get the kinks out of the muscles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was amazing how rapidly civilization was left behind , with a power line crossing not far downstream from our takeoff point being the last sign for days . <p> Less than an hour into the trip it began to rain . Nothing serious , just light misty drops . We courted a loon as we lazily followed the watery trail towards James Bay . <p> When we stopped to scout Rock Island Rapids to scout torrential rainfall of monsoonal proportions overtook us complete with close lightning strikes , hail , and gale force winds . What an initiation . While we waited out the storm on the rocks , watching our canoes fill with water , with bug dope dripping into eyes , we knew that this was merely the give and take of all such adventures . <p> Rock Island Rapids is a rather straight forward set taken for the most part down the left side between the island and the three foot standing waves in the left-center channel . <p> Milt and Mary , in the mood for an adventure of their own lined their Old Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main river channel . Milt slipped early into the lining and sprained an ankle . Fortunately this being about the 10,000th sprain of said ankle during his forty-nine years , it was but a minor problem . <p> Two or three hours downstream we arrived at Black Feather Rapids , marked CBR , Can Be Run ( more on this later ) , with a .36 mkle portage right . Upon scouting we felt that we could run it , especially since we were already soaked by the rain . This rock garden of rock gardens requires some tricky maneuvers to avoid the obstructions and three foot waves . I was worried about the others as we were first through and narrowly escaped disaster in the bodacious Class III waves . Mom and Dad made it safely to the eddy that we were in , and there being only room for two canoes , Helen and I moved on to a tricky set of lower rapids that caught us off-guard and almost tipped us . Later Milt and Mary told us that Mary lost her paddle in the big waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it miraculously popped up next to him . They then broached on a rock , but because of the makeup of the Old Towns hull they were able to slid off and find a safe eddy for a momentary respite . <p> It was shortly after this twisting run through the maze of boulders that is Black Feather that Milt informed me that CBR stands for " Check Before Running . " Oops ! <p> It was getting late and the moods of the voyageurs and daylight were taking a dive fast , so we searched for the first camp site . Everyone was looking forward to the baked potatoes and fresh green beans that we carried in special for our first nights dinner . We skipped on camp without enough tent sites and settled for the second one next to Beam Rapids , along the portage trail . It added to the canoers initiation ceremony , a wet , nosy , small , insect haven with no fishing in the dark , poor swimming , and difficult dish washing . We set up camp and prepared an abbreviated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bugs . I think the bugs ate more of us than we ate for dinner . We had to skip our " special " first-night dinner which meant that we would have to carry the heavy load for another day . One good thing is that we had fish that Helene and I caught at a creek upstream of Beam Rapids . Helene had caught a fallfish which we cooked , tried to eat and promptly renamed foulfish because it is filled with y-bones that you cant see in the dark and cant feel until they stab you in the back of the throat , to say nothing of the taste ! <p> It rained that night and the wind was gusty , rounding out the day as a perfect initiation to the three first timers and a subtle reminder to the seasoned veterans . Despite the day no one was wavering , although Mary shared with us later that she considered paddling back upstream while she and Milt were standing on Rock Island in the rain , wind , hail , and lightning , each holding a rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Day 2 Tuesday July 20 Bare Rock Point . It will have to be a better day ...... <p> A bad first day an awkward 1st camp led to a late 11:05 start . A short paddle to Kettle Falls revealed a beautiful rapids-side campsite++ that could have made day one a better day . We pulled over left , avoiding yet another portage ( .25 miles , river left ) . I think the three first time voyagers were beginning to wonder why we were trying so hard to avoid a portage . We paddled through tropic-like mist squalls , gentle current and wind all day . Milt was making three day weather predictions based on cloud types , north winds , and the way the smoke rose from the campfire . I was n't sure if this was voodoo , Indian magic , or real , but the forecast was good , so for now I was believing it . Lunch was on the swampy shore of the south end of Isabell Island , a good lunch considering the mist storm and mosquitoes . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We continued on the the right channel around Isabell and Alice Islands . Helen and I chased a couple of loons around Alice Island and noticed many sighs of beaver along the way . The campsite on the side of the river at the north end of Alice Island is a nice one , but difficult to access , high on a clay bluff . A short paddle further brought us to Bare Rock Point , a campsite+ with deep swimming , good fishing , and decent tent sites . We were visited by loons , a beaver , and an otter to remind us that we were far from home . Dad and I each caught large northern pike . My pike had been chewed on previously , probably by an even larger pike . When dad hooked his pike he was alone in a canoe and needed an emergency net run by Milt and I to land the fish . Upon cleaning it we found a mouse in its stomach . <p> The girls were getting used to the fact that the waters contained plenty of leeches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to suck your blood . The rain and mist combined with the brush that the tents were set up in made it into a mosquito haven . Helen said that one even bit her , " You know where " when she was " taking care of business . " We had our first-day special dinner out on Bare Rock Point that evening under a colorful sunset sky . In the morning Helene would count sixteen mosquito bites on one hand . <p> Day 3 Wednesday July 21 ... First Portage <p> We were late getting out of the tents ( 8:30 ) and had a tasty fried fish breakfast . The added work associated with cooking fish along with looking for Dads lost knife gave us a late start on the river ( 11:30 ) . I went for a swim with the dive mask and found Dads knife four feet under water next to Bare Rock . The day started with strong head winds and broken cumulus clouds , good current and periodic rapids . So far Milts weather forecast has been correct which is good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during these weather conditions . If that is true , then Milts forecasting techniques correlate that way smoke rises from a campfire to the appetite of fish . For now I 'll believe the weather , but not the fishing forecast . Both Mom and Dad and Helene and I had near tip-over mishaps in the unnamed rapids in this stretch before the Thunder House Falls Portage trail . By 2:30 we reached the portage for Thunder House Falls . I think everyone had butterflies in their stomachs because of the tales of drowned canoers that we had heard and read about who missed the portage and were swept over the falls . But with Milt and I laying our trusted , water sealed , topo maps in front of us as we canoed , we were able to keep track of just where we were at any given point on the river . If one is to adventure out onto a wilderness river , beset of whitewater , this ability to follow a topo map along with extensive research , allows the canoer to know the enemy and with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our first portage , 1.1 miles long . It was Milts first experience carrying a canoe and the first time for Helene and Mary carrying 45 lb. packs . It only took about a third of a mile before everyone realized why we were trying so hard to avoid portaging . The smokey memories of bugs biting you in every place that you ca n't reach with packs and canoes on your backs along with the soreness of muscles used infrequently outside of portages became vivid again for the experienced paddlers and were already permanent fixtures in the minds of the new voyagers . <p> I helped Milt lift the canoe to his shoulders and explained how to redistribute the pain as your walking by rolling the canoe forward and back on your neck . Milt was followed by Helene , then me . He made it as far as the first slippery log bridge where his boot slid between two the logs up to his ankle in muck and jammed . The canoe came down there without injury to Milt as he deposited it onto the nearest , soft looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I noticed that I put the canoe up on Milt backwards at first which must have been unbalanced and painful . Sorry Milt ! <p> The question of " Why are we doing this ? " was obviously running through our heads at this point . Mom suffered from a very sore knee and Milts was experiencing a pinched nerve and dislocated discs in his lower back for which he was scheduled to be operated one after returning from this trip . The doctors reaction when Milt informed him of this upcoming trip was , " You 're not going to injure your back any more than it already is so go ahead with the trip . " All of these thoughts and aches ran through our minds and bodies . Despite these agonies we were rewarded with a momentous lunch spot over the third drop of Thunder House Falls . Words cant describe the beautiful view of some of the oldest surface rock on earth being separated by 100 foot wide chute that was funneling the entire Missinaibi over three major drops . The falls were terminated by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , Conjurers House , a place for prayer and mystic introspection where mere mortals can commune with the gods . I wondered if the Indians prayed because of its proximity to this god-forsaken portage trail . <p> Mist was rising from the falls . The sound was like thunder , the breeze was strong and clean , and the sun was buried in sea of blue and beginning to lay low in the sky . There was n't a pause or stutter by anyone when Dad suggested that this be the camp for the night . Ahh , this is what it is all about . An early camp at one of the most scenic and remote spots in northern Ontario . We had n't  seen another person since we left Owen at Mattice and we know wed be alone here tonight . The only other visitor was a very tame and hungry red squirrel . Everyone had a chance to take a bath , thank God . Helene and I fished the eddied in the chute downstream from Conjurers House , unsuccessfully . Milts predictions have been 100% correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a correlation between the way smike rises from campfires and the way fish bite . The weather is beautiful , the sights and sounds are momentous and the fishing stinks . <p> Dinner was on the top of the 200 foot high cliffs just five feet from the ecgte , spaghetti . We had to watch our camp gear in the wind , because anything that found itself over the edge of the cliff would have been unrecoverable . <p> Day 4 Thursday July 22 ... Forever Memories <p> We woke to the thundering sound of the falls in the canyon . The sun was shining bright , something that the spectacular sunset had promised last evening . The sun illuminated the mist as it boiled out of the supper set of Falls . Everyone was refreshed and in notably better spirits after an early night and unspoiled sleep . I 'm not sure when we actually got started , but I think it was around 9:30 . <p> We had a short carry downhill to the end of the portage trail . The ominous reminder of a wrecked aluminum canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal miscalculation by two canoeists earlier in the month . <p> Canoeing started with a tricky set of Class I-II sets of rapids and short paddle to the Stone Rapids Portage Trail . The sun was bright and the breeze was strong . We were much more organized on this portage as we worked out the details yesterday . The trial was .6 mile long , wide , and easy walking except for the 40-80 lbs . on our backs , bugs , and a steep drop at the end of the trail . The bugs were bad . They 're especially bothersome when were carrying a canoe in the breeze and forget to put on bug dop like me ! The upside-down canoe provides a wind free haven for the mosquitoes , deer flies , black flies , and horse flies . Your face , neck , ears , and wrists provide an " all you can eat " smorgasbord for every six legged arthropod with a yen for human blood . At times there is nothing else you can do about the bugs gnawing away at your flesh short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course means that we have to expend the energy to lift it again . <p> Dad slipped and almost took a bad tumble with the canoe on his way down the drop-off at the end of the trail . Moms calf muscles were very tight due the corrective steps she was taking to relieve the pain in her knees yesterday . We left mom and the five of us returned for a second load . In good time we were back on the river again . We fished the eddy at the end of Stone Rapids from 12:20-1:00 unsuccessfully . Note that campfire smoke would not rise quickly if we had a fire going at this moment , according to Milts forecasting techniques . <p> Again we had a short paddle through a tricky set of rapids to the Long Rapids Portage Trail , river right . This is another portage trail that is at the head of the " Do n't  Miss This One " list . Miss it and a severe , life threatening struggle , awaits you in the gorge ahead . <p> We were organized and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we were warned that it was a doozy . Well , this is the second point in the trip that words cant begin to explain . This portage trail had everything ; steep climbs , bugs , woodland paths , shin deep mud , slippery log bridges both width-wise and length-wise , rocks , gravel , and fresh bear tracks . It had all the ingredients of a memory making challenge . Moms knee and Milts back were still ailing them and the bugs were ailing all of us , but this time I remembered to put on bug dope . It sucked ! There was n't much talking on the first trip over and almost none on the trip back . At times Milt set his canoe down and dragged it throught the mud down the trail . Being fiberglass it looked like a nice alternative to the smash-your-neck method that we stuck to . When we got back to the starting point for a second load , everyone filled their empty water bottles . We used the water purifier as a human powered drinking fountain to quench our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill next to the portage trail . <p> At one point we clearly defined the distinction between wind and breeze . Breeze is that wonderful , fresh smelling current of air that blows the bugs away and cools us off on the portage trail . On the other hand , wind , referred to as " S.O.B . wind " by Helene , is the exact same current of air that 's blows us off course broadside into a rock as we try to pick our way through the rapids . Mom says that its like we have a love-hate relationship with air . <p> I reapplied the bug dope that was flushed from my skin by sweat , muck and foliage before heading back with a pack . In time the portage was over . Nobody took the side trail to view the gorge , much to our regret later on after the trip was over . Fatigue makes cowards of us all . <p> We enjoyed a small lunch on a cobble-stone point at the end of Long Rapids . It looked like an excellent fishing eddy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went for a cool dip with the diving mask and found a fishing lure . It was a refreshing event that I recommended to the others without response . <p> The day was already long , but it was n't over yet . We were at the head of Four Mile Rapids , described on maps as " very strong with a " USE EXTREME CAUTION " notation and CBR , which I now know stands for " Check Before Runing " . Well , as Milt and Mary will attest , we CBRd by viewing the rapids from a standing position in the canoe at the head of the rapids to pick a good line , totally ignoring the " use extreme caution " warning . We all took in water at the second set that needed to be bailed in an eddy between sets . Milt and Mary were following Helene and I not knowing that I was feeling a bit cocky and interested in the biggest waves and challenges we could find . In the 4th of 5 sets I chose a chute far left that required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Milt was watching us from 50 feet behind he saw us disappear ! He said that our whole canoe , excepting our heads , went out of view in the waves as we narrowly scaved the pour-over rock to the left . A great ride ! <p> Either Milt felt tht he should avoid this chute or the river did , but his canoe only made it a third of the way over the pour-over rock ( Marys third ) . They proceeded immediately into a Class II rapids twirl and dropped off the rock . To this day , Milt does n't  admit it , but I think he was just trying to accumulate " style points " , because they came out of it with only a few gallons to bail . <p> Although the maps strongly suggested lining Four Mile Rapids , we opted to run them based on the idea that more injuries seem to occur when lining than when running , even when a tip-over occurs . These rapids were deep enough to float down without bumps or broken ankles in the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The fifth set brought us into Bells Bay , a beautiful , calm , wide bend in the river where the Missinaibi shifts from a northern to a northeastern flow . What a wonderful sight to us all . We had left the pre-Cambrian outcrops of the Canadian Shield and were now in the glacial till deposits that marks the beginning of the Arctic Wilderness . The clay banks and gravelly outwash were evidence of this change in terrain . We now began to notice Devonian limestone fossils in the sediments along the river . <p> We selected a bay side campsite and fished a bit unsuccessfully after setting up camp . Dad caught a sturgeon on Milts pole that was set up on shore . We took a picture and let it go . The scalloped potatoes were just great doctored up with our evening ritual of shaking lemon pepper , minced onions , minced garlic , Lowerys , chopped dried peppers , and crushed red peppers . Helene counted 23 bug bites on one of her hands that night and her hand looked great compared to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is stories like the memories of this day that will make it impossible to answer the question of " Why ? " when were telling these tales to our friends this winter in the comfort of home . <p> Day 5- Friday July 23 ... Slow Water Blues <p> It was a long laborious day of paddling . Helene and I werent able to move as fast which added to the misery of a monotonous long day of paddling . I caught two smallmouth bass at the mouth of the Coal River . A bush plane flew overhead as we were taking our break there . It was the first sight and sound of civilization in five days . Dad caught a walleye and lost another and Milt watched the biggest pike he ever saw jump in front of his canoe . ( Actually this happened quite often and we after learned that these were sturgeon , not pike ) The sun was shining bright . The wind was light and in our face when it blew . The fish tasted good for dinner with macaroni and cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pivabiska River . <p> Day 6 will be another long one so we hit the sack at 9:445 . Helene said that she had to pull the pencil out of my hand because I fell asleep writing . Dad heard a bear next to his tent that night . When Helene woke to our sounds to scare it away she asked what was going on . I responded , " Were scaring a bear out of our camp . " Her only reply was , " Well wake me up if I have to do anything . " With this she went back to sleep . <p> Day 6 - Saturday July 24 ... White Spruce Island <p> I was up at 6:30 . Milt and Mary soon followed . Everyone was up by 7:15 . This allowed Helene and I to push off around 9 ? 00 , twenty minutes earlier than the others which helped us to move at our own paces . We paddled over glass-like water conditions with tannic foam bubbles floating on the water downstream of the Pivabiska River . The sun was pouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slightly over our right shoulder at others . At a short morning break , someone commented how nice it was when the sun ditched behind on of the little cumulus clouds in the sky . How true it was . We laughed because this was exactly opposite to our wishes during the first two and a half days . We had lunch , deviled ham on crackers at the Soweska River opening and paddled on for another two to three hours to a beautiful spruce haven campsite just upstream from the Opasatika River mouth . We were disappointed at the signs of inconsiderate campers who left initials carved into the trees and junk , including a full sized mattress at this campsite . The river was now big enough to land float planes and this is probably a sign of it . <p> Milt and I each caught two walleyes in the pools between the shallows upstream from this site . They tasted great with rice-a-roni as a side dish . Some tree frogs or crickets kept Helene awake for awhile that night . Twice they hopped on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound spooking us for a moment . tomorrow would be a short day in comparison , so we went to bed later than normal and dreamed about pancakes for breakfast . <p> Day 7 - Sunday July 25 ... Main Sail <p> Milt and I were up early to get the fire going . Everyone else followed . We pushed off about 10:00 ; Helene and I a bit early again as to prevent holding the others up while paddling . We soon entered a set of shallow rapids just upstream of the Opasatika River . The wind was still and the sun was bright and shining on our faces and right side . The Missinaibi grew noticeably wider after the Opasatika entered . It also make a good fishing hole along the right bank . Milt and I both picked up a walleye there . Shortly after that , Helene and I pick up a snag ont the fishing line which put us back in last place . It is frustrating being last because you feel like you 're playing catch-up all day and any wildlife sightings are long gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have grown unfondly used to this position . <p> Lunch was peanut- butter on anything located on a nothing but stones island . My water purifier clogged so lunch was without liquid . As our spirits dropped , the wind picked up it was obvious that everyone wa going stir crazy with all the monotonous paddling . Mom started a trend by holding a rain poncho up to act as a sail in her outstretched arms . Mary followed with a similar act , while Helene and I strapped the lunch tarp to two paddles forming a sort of spinnaker sail and left the others in our wake , a new feeling for us . <p> Milt baked the three walleyes with the spices and dried vegees that we had . The walleye tasted great with spaghetti under the big white spruce on this island camp . just after we went to bed a strong wind storm with a bit of rain kept us awake for a short while . The wind spooked Helene and the rain soaked Mom and Dads sleeping bags . <p> Day 8 - Monday July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other day except it was a bit earlier and everyone took a little water from the overnight rain . We were up and out between 6:30 and 7:00 and ready to push off at 8:30 . It was at this site that I began to notice a trend in the daily routine of everyone . <p> Each evening when we arrived at camp , no matter how wet , whipped , or beaten we were , Milt always searched for a pile of dry firewood and cut it using a hand bow saw into 6-10 inch lengths . he always cut more than wa requested by Dad who was usually reconstructing the rock fire ring into a work of art that he called " the stove " with great pride . Soon a fire was burning and Milt was " smoking up " a ritual-like slow dance that he performed in the campfire smoke to deep the bugs off because he did n't  like using bug dope . <p> During this same time Dad prepared the cook kit and laid out the food for the night . Mom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tents and laid out the sleeping bads with periodic help from Milt , Dad , and I. In the morning , Milt and Mary were first up and either Milt or I were first out to build the morning fire . Milt and I would have a cup of " Gary coffee " which was my recipe for espresso-like black coffee that Milt claimed to make his beard grow longer than ever . Once everyone was up and having breakfast , Milt would give the morning weather and new report . This daily routine took on the name of the " Chief Moose Jaw Report . " One other daily occurrence happened as we pushed off shore each morning . Dad would sing out his one word song called " Granola . " I think he extracted the music for it from a TV commercial . It was sung in the spirit of the oatmeal-granola concoction we call " canoers breakfast " . It echoed through the hills when he sang it and may account for us not seeing much wildlife . <p> There were many other noteworthy routines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good group on this trip . Three experienced and three newly initiated wilderness canoeists . A trip like this can be made miserable if one or more do n't  take part . <p> We pushed off together on this 8th day knowing it would be the longest paddling day of the trip . We had to cover about 25 river miles with an increasingly wide and shallow river profile . The average river width has grown from about 600 feet at Mattice to about 800 feet in the parts we will be paddling today as measured off the topo maps ) . The weather was overcast and misty as Chief Moose Jaw predicted , with a 43.67% chance of rain . <p> Although it was somewhat gloomy , it was a nice reprieve from the bright sunshine that we paddled into the last three days . There was also much more current than we expected . The river was marked with shoals , shallows , and small sets of rapids that were separated by sporadic deep-water holes that would probably have been excellent for fishing if we though we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but did n't  have was wind at our backs , referred to as " nice wind " . Milt and I had improved on our sail designs and were hoping for an opportunity to try them out to save our strength for fishing in the evening . One and a half hours into the day , we encountered a set of rapids labeled the map " Use Extreme Caution " . At this point it began to downpour for a short time , something that Helene had predicted . We scouted the rapids from our canoes , as usual , and Milt and Mary took the lead in finding a successful line through the rapids . It was obvious that either their paddling confidence was up , or they really wanted to get off the river , because this was the first time they took the lead in a noted strong rapids . <p> We stopped after two hours of paddling for a riverside stretch and after four hours for lunch on a very welcome rocky point . Lunch was cheese and salami on crackers , yumm ! After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddling technique . Helene would take twenty hard strokes then rest for about six of mine . This helped to put us in the lead and stay there for the rest of the trip . Helene and I reached the camp at 4:30 , a half hour ahead of the others . I turned the fire ring into a stove and cooked up a batch of everything left in the food pack and named it " long haul stew " . Everyone washed up on a cobble stone shoal and called it an early night . My night was much earlier than the others as I fell asleep on the top of our sleeping bags and gear when I went to the tent for a change of clothes . <p> Day 9 Tuesday July 27 ... Finale <p> Day nine started with the sound of a wolfs howl during breakfast . We were now boiling water to purify it and letting it sit overnight to cool . Helene tried one of her emergency iodine water purification tablets and tried to mask the taste with Crystal Lite to limited success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems without it . We pushed off the Portage Island campsite at 10:03 , paddled into the strongest S.O.B . wind yet . The Missinaibi ends at Portage Island where the Mattagami River more than doubles it to form the Moose River which is over a mile wide at that point . Although we were paddling in a good strong current , the wind blew harder into our face testing our paddling patience for the final two hours . It was overcast and warm . <p> The paddling journey terminated at Moose River Crossing , a zero population blip on a railway map where the train tracks cross the Moose River . This was the first sign of human development , aside from a trappers cabin and MNR water station , that we encountered in nine days ; a welcome sight . Once on the shore of Moose River Crossing we were still faced with a .3 mile portage down the trestle and tracks to the town of Moose River , population two , an eighty year old Indian and his sixty year old son . From Moose River we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles north on the Moose River , just short of James Bay . <p> The portage started with a steep climb up a gravel embankment that caused Helene to fall and get turtled upside-down on her backpack . In the confusion and excitement , I forgot to help Milt hoist his canoe to his shoulders which I found out later he did by himself for the first time . <p> The only other travelers at Moose River were a threesome of solo paddlers who finished the same trip a day ahead of us . We shared highlight stories and dreams of civilized luxuries such as ice cubes and warm showers that we hoped to find in Moosonee . They told us about one paddler they met , an MNR ranger , who sprained or broke his ankle on the second day so bad that he had to finish the trip on camp-make crutches . <p> The train was right on time . We loaded our canoes and gear into a box car marked " canoe car " and boarded the passenger section agreeing with the conductor to pay for train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fifty-eight minutes across subarctic terrain with dwarf spruce the most common flora . Upon arrival in Moosonee we left our canoes in the locked canoe car and headed into town . <p> Moosonee is a strikingly more touristy than expected . We were definitely in the minority to the average nonresident tourist-like travelers . Many of them took interest in us as we walked down main street dressed in our worn canoe garb and backpacks . Or maybe they were looking at Mom who was escorting us carrying a case of Molson X that we bought moments earlier . <p> Thank God Milt and Mary thought to make reservations for rooms because Moosonee was booked . Our rooms were at the Moosonee Lodge and provided us with luxuries such as ice , hot showers , dinner at a table , a real bed . <p> We had time to look around town before going to bed . It is a rather interesting place whose roads lead nowhere . One of the most unique features revolve around the three or four taxis that seem to cruise through town on regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belie the fact that you ca n't drive there from Moosonee . Where they were going as they dashed to and fro about town is anyones guess . <p> So ended our sojourn into the wilds of the Missinaibi . The joys and aches , the sweat and laughter remain with us to this day . This journey has become more than a mere adventure , it has become a part of who we are . <p> Do n't waste your time and money buying government topos for this route ( they are too numerous , badly outdated and have no paddling info ) . Chrismar has 2 of just 3 map guides needed for this route ( the 3rd is nearing completion ) . Far more detail , route descriptions , far less expensive , waterproof , etc. , etc. 
@@107413537 @2813537/ 134052 @qwx994052 134053 @qwx994053 <h> Swift Kipawa <p> Our first design , the Kipawa , was the forerunner of a new breed of fast , seaworthy and maneuverable tripping canoes designed to meet the modern tripper 's requirements . While the Kipawa offers unprecedented performance to experienced paddlers , it also provides a secure , big-boat feeling for novices . Few canoes can bring out the best in your paddling skills so well as the Kipawa <p> We bought our Kipawa in 2004 in Stowe , VT for our yearly week-long trips into Algonquin . Paid $1100USD for a brand new Ultra Light Kevlar , cherry wood , sliding bow seat . 53lbs . This canoe has NEVER disappointed in any situation , rapids , chop , glass or wind . You do n't fight for every inch of water with this fast boat . We travel at approx 460-470lbs with gear and 2 adults and the boat loves the weight . Tracks exceptionally well and portages very easily . I agree that it is difficult to solo in . Would never go away from a SWIFT . Sights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bit hard to handle solo -- needs the weight of a second person . Also , can be tough to handle with someone small in the front . All in all , experience is dependent on how well you match its weight specs . I personally should have gone for the Mattawa for my needs . Great boat , though ! Do n't be afraid to buy used from Swift -- have n't had a problem yet and saved big time on the price . No patches or noticeable weak spots in the body , either . <p> Bought my Kipawa at the end of the 2005 season and waited until I 'd used it this summer before submitting a review . The canoe is fast , tracks well and will carry a substantial amount of gear for extended trips . At only 49 pounds , it is a joy to portage ... especially after years of lifting a 90+ pound fiberglass over the infamous Dickson-Bonfield portage in Algonquin . <p> I actually have a Temagami . But just wanted to let every one know that once you buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swift . THE SERVICE SUCKS ! ! I took my canoe in for a repair , they fixed it but sanded a 1 ' x 5 ' section and left it . It looks like crap and they are making the biggest hassle about it . They have had the canoe for 2 months and I still do n't have it fixed yet . I would recomend either a different Manufacturer or call them a throw-away canoe . Unless just about $5oo for a 3 " crack repair and some other factory damage does n't bother you . <p> Bought my Kipewa in 1990 , it 's one of the first ones built ! It 's the first canoe I 've purchased and my favorite ride . Excellent primary and secondary stability . Great cargo capacity . Solo for a day or tandem for a week + the dog , it can handle it all . Angry Openongo waves in Algonquin , windy Georgian Bay - I 'll paddle my Kipewa for another 15 years ! <p> I found the swift to be a quality choice by my stern padler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fortunate to get to use this 17 footer in all conditions and enviroments in lake and river systems . For we crossed Algonquin from west to east compleeting 180km in 16 days . We had a grueling schedule and did the trip in the hight of bug season . Needless to say this canoe ( used ) performed admiraly and held a substantial wieght for the trip was long and we did get wet only adding to the wieght factor . I personaly have afted or steared many canoes and for the size of her she handled responsively . Of course my stern man was exceptional during the river sections needless to say the whole trip at powering us through rough or complicated rapid runs . Furthermore you just cant go wrong with this exceptional tracker , We even had a sail helping on a long paddle section and it still tracked wonderfully in 2 foot waves and loaded down with aproximately 600lbs . A helpfull hint is have a strong stern man for river sections with a big canoe and u will be fine .. thanks all " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before embarking on a two week canoe trip across algonquin . It came from outfitters who rent swift canoes . It tracks well and seems to perform better with more weight in it than non . It is extremely difficult to canoe solo in the wind , but what canoe is easy to paddle solo in the wind ? The canoe withheld a fall during a 4 Km portage . The canoe 's hull did not break , but the yoke broke . We portaged for the rest of the week carrying the canoe upside down with our heads on the seats . I do not blame swift for the yoke breaking under these circumstances . On another trip the canoe performed well with three people in it who averaged 150 lbs . ( not including gear ) . I think this canoe is great and would recommend it to anyone . <p> The Kipawa is the 7th canoe I 've ever owned , and I 've taken her on 7 trips and numerous day-trips and evening paddles , so I feel comfortable in providing a review . I selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe that was light enough for me to comfortably portage . Mine is laid up in Expedition-weight kevlar and sports a kneeling thwart and sliding bow-seat . I 'll cover recommendations on the options I selected , towards the end of this review . It handles a variety of water conditions quite well , and excels in the big wave conditions one encounters on the larger lakes . Tracking is super in both lakes and the infrequent class 2 rapids I 've encountered . Although tender ( a bit jittery ) when paddled empty , it demonstrates excellent primary and secondary stability under load . I carry far more equipment than I really require , but hey , I 'm getting old and need all of those comforts , right ? ! It 's great knowing my Kipawa can handle the loads needed for week-long trips without batting an eye . Options . The sliding bow seat was a waste of money as I very infrequently paddle with anyone whose weight is so dramatically different than mine that moving a day pack either in front or behind me wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay , however I 'll be replacing it this coming spring with a home-built , quick-release seat for solo tripping . The expedition-weight kevlar lay-up has been a very good compromise between strength and weight . I stayed with the aluminum gunwales as they are lighter than the optional gunwale packages ( vinyl , wood ) and require absolutely no maintenance . The seats and thwart wood is all cherry , which looks great and have stood up well over the past 3 years with only an annual coat of boiled linseed oil .

It flows northerly for 160 miles to confluence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access is another 150 miles . Always hunting for that perfect wilderness whitewater river , Nate Houser , Ron Honaker , Gregg Doggett , Tom McCloud , Mike Elsea , Bob Kimmel , Curt Gellerman and Mike Iwachiw , with 8 solo canoes , drove the 3,800 miles from Virginia to Mayo , Yukon , and from there chartered a floatplane which carried us into the headwaters lake . <p> Bonnet Plume Lake at 3,600 feet , was a lovely place , with bare-topped mountains all around and light blue water so clear you could see rocks 10 feet deep . We spent that first day , 28 July , organizing , hiking , resting , admiring the surroundings . When the sun ducked behind a cloud it was cold with light rain spitting , but when it shone the jackets quickly came off . Fishing was good with 11 nice grayling being taken . Around 3 pm as Ron was cleaning his catch , rain mixed with sleet came pelting down . We were not alone : two guys from Munich , Germany , were camped just up-lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped off . We invited them to share our cooking fire that evening . The Germans brought 4 grayling and the French brought one , which resulted in two hours of fish frying over a poor willow fire , but mighty fine eating , and plenty for all . When the rain started falling harder it was a crowded , but warmer , wilderness with 14 people huddled underneath Bobs rainfly .. <p> The river exited the lake with 250cfs flow , but soon jumped to 800cfs , and perhaps because of recent heavy rain , the water was very turbid . Current was fast , 6 or 7 mph , cutting into gravelly alluvium , with evidence of recent higher flows . Soon we were in a the little canyon , but I find it hard to call it by that name . Its kind of a trough with very little bedrock , just a few larger boulders , and some narrowing of the river , so the rapids stayed in the non-technical 2/3 range . Though the river was much higher than normal for this time of year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We floated past yet another group of paddlers staying in camp on this gray day . Twenty something miles into the trip we came on a class 4 rapid where there is a constriction through bedrock . The portage was just 30 yds . At lunchstop a couple guys demonstrated how bush they had gone by eating leftover fish , cold , using treebark as their plate . Additional class 2+ rapids that deserved attention occurred in the next few miles , and half of a red ABS canoe , partly buried in the gravel , was seen . As the valley opened up there was a lot of braiding , though there was no problem in finding a channel with enough water to get through . <p> On the second day the river was bigger and uniformly gray , the shade of liquid concrete . Before long we were in another small canyon . The first significant rapid had a huge tongue in the center but a sneak route over a ledge on the right . Ron and Mike were bank scouting when Ron saw a canoe coming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's my boat ! ..... oh shit ! , and goes tearing down the bank . His boat , loaded with all his gear and food for the two week trip , ran the rapid perfectly and eddied out . Ron jumped into the river , swam to it , and just in time grabbed the stern as it was pulling into the current again . This was pushy class 3 water , but not difficult . Then this short canyon ended , the river bottom broadened , and there was again a lot of braiding for many miles . As the miles went by quickly with the fast current we viewed mountaintops heavily shrouded in clouds . A noble bull caribou ran along the right bank , then swam across . Camp was pitched at about mile 48 . <p> Finally ! After 3 rainy days we got a perfect morning . While enjoying Chef Nates blueberry pancakes and Bobs country ham , a black bear was spied high on the opposite mountainside . There were many flowers along the way : lots of purple fireweed , a yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fast morning on class 1-2 sections we came upon another canyon . At the entrance you could see maybe + mile , get a good look at 3 distinct rapids , and note the 100 foot canyon walls , not vertical but steep . This section starts with a river-wide ledge easily sneakable on the left , then after 200 ft a ledge that extended out from the left bank created big waves and must be passed to the right , and then an even bigger rapid just below that , where river left is the place to make a portage . Several guys ran down to the third rapid , carried gear around , lifted the boat over , and ran the rest of the canyon light , while others portaged the entire canyon . I suspect that at a normal water level most of this rapid would be quite easy , except for that third rapid . Past the canyon , there was some more class 2/3 whitewater , with big waves and holes to be avoided , but this was easily done . <p> It rained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the morning , it was really not looking good for hiking , or photography or even laying over , and the upstream wind would make it real tough to be paddling . While standing around , talking over our options , a pair of wolves suddenly appeared directly across the river on the high bank . In the lead was a buff colored animal who stopped and stared directly at us . Behind and more secretive was an almost black animal . Both were big adults . After they had studied us for 30 seconds they moved back into the woods and out of sight . Several of us went for a hike , initially through spruce up to 30 feet tall and 4 inches diameter , then as altitude was gained , on steep scree slopes where the footing was bad and the vegetation small and sparse . We reached a ridge and followed it higher , enjoying the scenery . This mountain is U-shaped , and we looked into the open part of the U , a bare bowl slowly filling with loose rock falling from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tiny , colorful domes of our tents . Our descent back toward camp was along a remarkable little creek that flowed through a sharp-sided cleft in solid rock in a series of falls and potholesa kind of seven teacups of the north . <p> The morning of 2 Aug. was clear with frost on the packs . There are massive gravel flats on the valley bottom of the Bonnet Plume , and following the channel swiftly back and forth across these flats became the name of the game for several days . The gradient stayed at 20 fpm and very uniform . There must be 3 or 4,000 cfs volume , but only occasional large waves . About 20 miles downriver we spotted 4 sheep , first at river level , then they climbed a hill and could be seen moving along the crest for some time . After a 26 mile day we reached Fairchild Creek and set up camp on the bar across its multiple mouths . It had become quite warm in the late afternoon , perhaps 80 , and after my camp chores were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 8 days ago . <p> Morning was very windy , making it feel real cold . Being well ahead of schedule , we decided that taking a day for fishing was in order , but since we 'd not had a hit from the muddy river , if we were to catch anything we would have to hike to a clear-water lake . Several of the guys picked up a trail which lead to Fairchild lake , but I decided to tow my canoe up the creek and try to reach Fairchild lake by this route . The upstream tracking went fast . The creek was usually 25 feet across , and streamside brush was rarely a problem . The gradient was uniform , perhaps 50 fpm , and with 250cs the current was constantly fast . But after 1 + hours a canyon blocked progress . Ron and I grabbed our rods and hiked over the hill , soon finding a spectacular little fall of 30 feetdefinitely not canoeable . Gazing upstream , this valley looked a lot like a beaver meadow . There were heavily used moose/caribou trails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy slog . Eventually we reached Fairchild lake and found the others casting . Its a very pretty place , a crystal clear blue lake , long and narrow , cradled below tree-covered steep hills . While we did n't  catch a trout on every cast , there were soon enough for supper . I hiked back to my boat and paddled downstream . In minutes I had overtaken Ron , who had a 15 minute head start , and a bit later I met up with the other guys who had hiked the overland route . I finished with an ear-to-ear smile ! This had to be the first ever descent of Fairchild Creek , perhaps 4 miles , and a joy it was ! While we were gone from camp the wind had died , the temperature warmeda lot , and this had brought out a swarm of gnats . These small flies looked a little like blackflies but did not biteyet there were so many they were in everything , on our skin , in the eyes , in the food . They took away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enough light in the tent for me to write trip notes . Up here it really never got completely dark all night long . <p> On 4 Aug. we awoke to a thick fog hanging 500 feet above , but temperature was mild . The river continued to have a uniform gradient : its a small-rock river , with a lot of braiding but never a problem finding a channel with enough water to float a boat . Within a half hour of launching , a small grizzly , came down the right bank , swam an erratic path across the river , looking like he was struggling , and pulled himself out on river left . He shook himself off and did an odd little dance , jumping around for no obvious reason . Later I saw several mergansers , a small falcon , some loons in flight and a couple crows . After lunch we came upon a group of 4 caribou cows with 4 calves out on an exposed gravel bar . Seeing us , they ran around , confused as they so often are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim to the mainland . And an hour later , walking a gravel bar was a small black bear . He seemed unafraid of us , just curious , and came in my direction . After shooting several pix , I grabbed a paddle and pushed off when he got 40 feet away . The mountains along this stretch of river have continued to be impressive , more vertical and more to a peak than the mountains upriver had been . The river was now mostly 100-150 yards wide in a continuously broadening valley , now a mile across . In places the river has cut its channel into the alluvial banks to a 50 foot depth . We pulled into a nondescript spot and set up camp for the night : a gravel flat 6 feet higher than river level , which had not been scoured for years , so had low growth and brush . Our progress this day was about 26 miles , and would have been more except for a persistent headwind . <p> 5 Aug Again a high , heavily overcast sky . Our cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across the gully , was mature forest , and downriver were our tents . Everyone had finished eating breakfast , and all but Ron and I were at the tents , packing . I was down in the gully and had just put the fire grid into its carrying sack , when from upriver through the woods came two light brown grizzly bears at a slow gallop . Being without pepper spray or banger at that moment , I kept the fire grid in my hands and stepped up onto higher ground . But at the gully the grizzlies stopped , looked at us or maybe got a whiff , then turned tail and ran back into the woods in the same direction they had come from . We were floating by 8:30 , a new early mark for us , and paddled near nonstop until 12:30 at which time we had covered 24 miles . After lunch the wind started to build , as it had yesterday , reaching a peak around 2:30 , then dying . We were not seeing much wildlife : a few gulls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The river was very full and swift when in the main channel , but there was also a lot of braiding . At one spot on river right was a 70 foot high alluvial hill being undercut , and as we passed , big lumps of soil and rock were cascading down into the river . We pulled into a river left gravel bar around 4pm , having traveled about 44 miles , and it had been easy with the swift current . Looking back upriver in the direction of the mountains that wed left this morning , they looked sooooo far away , but this gave a perspective on what can be done in just a day in a canoe . Throughout much of the day we had listened to the sound of sizzling bacon , the sound made by gravel hitting the bottom of the canoes , and proof that this river was moving a tremendous quantity of sand and gravel . <p> 6 Aug . The overcast was high , yet there was just barely enough light to cast a faint shadow . About 11 wed reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing and being unsuccessful , we decided to move on to the Peel . In the last half mile the Bonnet Plume braided into so many channels we really did n't  find a major flow , but there was plenty of water in these smaller channels . The confluence with the Peel was anti-climactic : no dramatic melding of the two big rivers in a huge whirlpool , great waves or turbulence . Just a quiet melding of the many small channels of the BP into the much bigger , muddy Peel . But the real surprise was the cliffs , which constrain the river on both sides just downriver . The current was fast , and with the great volume , very powerful . In only a quarter mile the river bent left , out of view , between these cliffs , and the dark purplish rock emanated a sinister feel . But inside the canyon there was no narrowing , no huge boulders in the riverbed or bedrock ledges ... only some fast current and waves , but no real rapids . Really , it was the geology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of black and whitereally zebra striped , and there were places where these layers were dramatically contorted and even set up 90 degrees on end ! The Peel moved right along , but was not uniformly as fast as the BP . We passed a place where there had been a massive landslide of several hundred yards from the right cliff down to water leveland there were still trees growing on top of the slide . About 3pm a heavy rain began , and at 4pm we pulled in at a gravel bar for a leg stretch , but the rain and wind combined to convince us to camp the night there . We had made about 40 miles downriver progress . This gravel bar was different from those on the BP , the kind formed by water flows of 30 or 50,000 cfs. , and the rocks were big , many basketball plus size . How big was the Peel ? Couldnt really tell the depth , but 10 or 15,000 cfs would not likely be too much out of line . Camp was set back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet away from the river and gave some protection from the weather . The mosquitoes started to notice us , and soon a whole lot of slapping was going on . After a spaghetti supper we sat around among the canoes out on the gravel bar , with light drizzle falling , to get away from most of them . Estimates of the height of the cliff on the opposite bank became a point of contention with guesses upwards of 300 feet . There had been some small rock falls from that cliff while we were watching , but after wed crawled into the tents , a sharp shot was heard followed by the sound of a lot of falling rock . <p> 7 Aug The threatened rain storm had not developed , but neither had any drying taken place overnight . There was again a high overcastthis was starting to remind me of a dog-days-of-August heat wave back home , but in Yukon the heat wave means a high of 70 . The current stayed at 5mph and the cliffs at the same height and appearance for mile after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and in other places the wind was blowing clouds of brown dust off the soil/alluvial cliffs . If you were to study the topo maps of the BP and Peel you would see a lot of braiding , and on the maps they look identical , but here on the ground they are very different : the BP had many smallish channels , but with the Peel there was almost always a single major channel which snaked completely across the valley floor , bumping into the opposite cliff sides . Sometime after lunchstop I saw a bald eagle , several gulls , and a black hawk with a white patch underneath its wings . Later in the day there was a lone cow moose standing quietly by the river . Around 4:30 we paddled across the Arctic Circle . If anything , it seemed to get warmer the further north we traveled , but the sun had become brighter and there was a glare on the water . We had wanted to make 60 miles for the day , and we did that . At the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody was awake at 9 pm . <p> 8 Aug . I figured that if we were to make another 60 miles this day we were going to need a lot of calories , so I made a buttermilk pancake breakfast . The scenery along the Peel became rather monotonous . The river was big and flat , sometimes flowing but a lot like lake paddling , and we really just wanted to finish off the remaining miles . We stroked steadily until lunchstop , and soon after , with maybe 50 miles remaining , the river seemed to loose all of its gradient . A sow black bear with two cubs was seen . Then we encountered the RCMP patrol boat making its weekly river reconnoiter . The Mountie asked if we were interested in a lift to Fort Macpherson . We said maybe and continued downriver , but by the time he returned on his downriver leg we had decided that this section of flat river was not worth two more days of our sweat . Canoes , people and the gear was loaded up . The ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Originally from Ottawa , he said he had really enjoyed his posting to Fort Macpherson , a community populated mostly by the Gwitchen people . Along the way he pointed out two historical sites along the river where members of " The Lost Patrol " were found dead early in the last century , and the new $2 million native peoples healing center , which looked like a modern church campground with log cabins . Five more bald eagles were seen , more than we had seen in the previous two weeks . It was a two hour trip to the ferry crossing of the river . The town of Fort Macpherson , NWT , at only a few feet above sea level , marked our furthest north , 670 26 . After a burger and fries at Minnies ( $12 CDN , but I 've got to admit they were pretty good ) , the only restaurant in town , and a fill of the gas tank , we started that 4,000+ mile homeward trip , the first leg of which was the Dempster highway , an all gravel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway . <p> So it had been a good trip . Some fine fishing in spots , a variety of wildlife , weather milder than expected and water higher than normal for August . About 320 miles in 13 days , with no mishaps . It was an easy trip , in that you can make a lot of miles without working very hard when the current is a constant 6 mph . The scenery was clean and wild , but the silty gray water was , for me , a big negative . The Bonnet Plume would be a worthwhile and suitable wilderness destination for any paddler with intermediate level paddling skills , and good common sense . Where will the next stop be in the search for the perfect river ? Only time will tell . 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @qwx994055 <p> Hey all , I wish everyone great paddling adventures this summer .

These plastic barrels certainly are the most waterproof of all options for carrying both your food and your gear . <p> These barrels can survive a bumpy ride down a stretch of class III rapids and when you retrieve it at the other end , you 're still going to find the contents safe and dry . <h> Barrel Types <p> The most common type of barrels are the blue polyethylene barrels used for transportation of bulk food and pharmaceuticals . The lids on these barrels have an 0-ring seal and generally fasten on with a metal ' snap ring ' . Occasionally , you 'll find this type of barrel with a screw-on lid . Some barrels have handles , others do n't . Common sizes are 30 litre and 60 litre . <p> This type of barrel can be carried in a soft canoe pack , or in a specially designed harness . A number of manufacturers make comfortable harnesses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some paddlers also use surplus olive barrels . These are smaller than the commercially available barrels .

They have a tightly-sealing screw-on top instead of the metal snap ring . <p> After many years of carrying our food in different types of packs , we 've recently tried using plastic barrels .

However , if a bear figures out that there 's food in the barrel and decides to get in , there is n't much doubt that the bear will win and your food barrel will lose . A good-sized black bear can peel open a car trunk to get at stored food - a polyethylene barrel would n't pose much of a challenge .

Stay away from the right side of the river here in low water . <p> After you have past the old bridge abutments , there is another big s bend . Try to stay mid stream here as the rock , a few feet from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the river . <p> As you approach Paris , by the golf course on the right bank , it is very shallow with no channel . Once through this shallow area the river deepens from the ponding effect of the dam . The take out is under the train bridge on the left side of the river . Do not paddle past the bridge , as the dam is just downriver . <p> The Cambridge - Paris rail trail runs along the east bank of the river . 134049 @qwx994049 134055 @qwx994055 <p> we did Paris to Brantford at the peak water level from what hurricane Isabelle had dumped last Sept. and stayed at the Brant Conservation area that night . Good trip , tame water .......... <p> Submitted by : Jay Alldred on 0000-00-00 <p> Be careful about using " Grand Experiences " outfitter service . On Oct.31/2004 their shuttle was a no-show and we were stranded at the end of our canoe trip . <p> Submitted by : Keith and Robin on 0000-00-00 <p> Just a follow up to the comment on the " Grand Experiences " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend ( May 23/2005 ) and we thought they were excellent . I would have no trouble recommending them . <p> Submitted by : Bruce Lindsay on 2009-02-03 <p> Watch for the rock with water bubbling up out of it near the east side of the river . It 's a natural fountain . The only place I 've ever seen such a thing . <p> Submitted by : Canoer on 0000-00-00 <p> 1 good I bad ; 50% chance of getting picked up is not excellent ! <p> Submitted by : Dale Renout on 0000-00-00 <p> Did the trip May 18,06 . Lots of water and very cold . River about 2 feet above normal . Lots of fun but saw a lot of canoes that had over turned . PS Please watch the damn in Paris they removed a body from there 2 days ago . They did n't see the sign . <p> Submitted by : Paddler on 0000-00-00 <p> A group of us paddled this route the last weekend of May/06- Excellent route , very fun swifts , particularly the sets below Glen Morris . FYI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a very " Interesting Experience " starting first with them trying to overcharge us for the kayak shuttle by $5.00 each - it was caught and fixed . However , We found them to be extremely disorganized , there was no clear direction on where to load our owned boats , or were to meet the shuttle to go to cambridge until we asked several times , then the shuttle was supposed to leave at 11:30am- 45 minutes later they actually showed up , then when we got to the site they did n't have the boats sprayskirts etc that we rented on the trailer , . So yet another 30 minute wait at cambridge to get rental boats . All they said was a meek sorry and that we had to make sure the rental boats were back by 6pm when they closed- What the fruitbat ? they have made us over 2 hours late to start this paddle and have the nerve to tell us to be on time ? I do n't think client service is a a priority for them . One of the renters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get any resolution for their tardiness and boat mix up 's . I will post if they do fix it . If not , then this is something that future customers might want to be aware of . Happy paddling ! ! <p> Submitted by : ? on 0000-00-00 <p> The rivers great ! ! But " Grand Experiences " dropped our canoe off the shuttle , ouch , ............ yep but got a free shuttle later the year . Great service , I would go back . <p> Submitted by : Sean on 2009-10-18 <p> This is a great river to paddle no matter who you are . I have paddled from Elora down to Brantford and have enjoyed every section . If you are not happy with Grand Experiences than try some of the other outfitter just like me . The 2 I use depending on what I want to do are " the heritage river canoe and kayak company " ( www.heritage river.com ) and " grand river rafting company " ( www.grandriverrafting.ca ) I chose these ones as they are both establishe reliable companies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only 2 options though . In Elora there are some outfitter that do trips in the gorge itself as well as the GRCA rents out tubes and provides a shuttle service ( great for the family ) . Further down in Kitchener you have canoeing the grand ( www.canoeingthegrand.com ) lunaticadventures ( **25;1797;TOOLONG ) treks in the wild ( www.treksinthewild.com ) blue heron rafting ( www.blueheronrafting.com ) grand river kayak ( www.grandriverkayak.com ) if you have any questions feel free to drop me an e-mail <p> Submitted by : Dannyo on 2009-08-06 <p> Try Lunatic Adventures .. small outfitting company out of St. George and a dynamite staff ! ! ! ! ! ! Ca n't say enough about them ! <p> Submitted by : Rivergal on 2009-07-17 <p> If you 're not happy with " Grand Experiences " , try Heritage River Canoe and Kayak Company based out of Brantford . They will NOT keep you waiting . <p> Submitted by : Kali on 2009-07-21 <p> Have kayaked along the Grand quite a few times and have used Grand Experiences just because it has been convenient to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never use Grand Experiences again . Numerous complaints : Always late with the shuttle pickup Boats are in terrible condition . We actually got a kayak without a seat and were told we did n't really need one . Pathetic ! Were dropped off and they had not boght enough kayaks for everyone on the shuttles , so our group ended up waiting for at least an hour for more kayaks to be dropped off . When we voiced our opinion , it fell on deaf ears . they really do n't give a %&amp;@ <p> Submitted by : OntarioPaddler on 2007-12-06 <p> Regarding Grand experiences . I 've tried this route 3 times with them . I will not use them again . First time we rented and paid for a packed lunch . Pick up was 45 mintues and they had no lunch for us . Second time I had paid extra for a sea kayak , they had only brought rec kayaks . It was hard to get the refund of the extra I had paid . 3rd time the pick up arrive an hour late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later that a family of 4 booked that morning and they got our seats even I had booked 3 weeks prior . I know , why did I try 3 times ? I have no kayak and no way to transport one so I was kind of stuck . Aside from " Grand Experiences " this is a nice run , not too hard and plenty of spots to stop for lunch ( the one you bring yourself ) . <p> Submitted by : CityBoy2708 on 2010-04-12 <p> I canoed down the Grand River ( from Glen Morris to Brantford ) for the first time last spring . We did an over night camping trip that was organized by TREKS IN THE WILD . They provided all the equipment , food and tents . Andy had great expertise about all things outdoors and Val made some wonderful wholesome food ! You should check them out at www.treksinthewild.com <p> Submitted by : Bobcatnorth on 2010-05-04 <p> We paddled from Cambridge to Paris on April 29th with Grand Experiences . The water level was low , but the river was easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 km section in 2.5 hours of paddling ( plus an extended lunch stop because we were making very fast time ) . We were the only boats on the river and the weather conditions were perfect . We found Grand Experiences great to deal with ( note we paddled on a week day - I imagine it is much busier on the weekend when I understand up to 100 boats can go out from Grand Experiences ) . <p> Submitted by : Stephanie on 2010-06-01 <p> Used Heritage for like my 7th time but did Glen Morris to Brant Park . They were busy the day we went but they did n't miss a step our ride was there early we were a little late leaving the launch area but told us not to worry about time they would accomodate us . They told us lots of tips about the river gave us water maps and phone numbers , and were there waiting for us in Brant Park even though we were 45 minutes late getting back in . Great company to choose really respectful of there clients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster section a few nice dips but a few really low spots too . The water was higher on the Paris to Brant Park side but also slower moving really had to paddle to get back . All in all another great day on the river . <p> Submitted by : Dale on 2010-07-19 <p> When the river is high this is a great trip . Lots of waves , lots of fun . On Canada day did Cambrdige to the Brantford Casinno is three hours . <p> Submitted by : Stephanie B. on 2010-10-11 <p> Went on my own on 10-10-2010 with my own kayak from the launch at the Cambridge-to-Paris rail trail by the Petro-Can on Hwy. 24 . It was a beautiful day and because the Conestogo Dam had been opened the water was fast flowing past Glen Morris especially with some good rapids by the Spottiswood Bluffs and throughout . It took me about 2hrs15min . This is a great stretch of the river and I saw a few osprey and some foxes . 
@@107413574 @2813574/ <p> This Route was done by suggestion of the great staff at Voyageurs Outfitters located on Gull Lake in the US . We had just finished a two week trip in the Boundary waters and re-supplied to go on this two week loop . The overall trip was amazing . Very few people , good fishing for walleye , lots of short portages . The hell portage was hell , muskeg up to the thy . Lemay lake is out of the way and hard to get to at low water , but definitely worth it . One of the best campsites I have ever been to . We saw more people at Louisa falls then the rest of the trip combined and it is easy to understand why so many people . The falls are wonderful . Very few people travel the route we did from Louisa to McEwen and the portages were sometimes hard to find and had lots of blow downs . The falls chain is soo cool it is worth seeing twice
