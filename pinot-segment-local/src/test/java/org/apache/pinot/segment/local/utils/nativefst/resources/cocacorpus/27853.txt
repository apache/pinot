You could make a grade level team , where all courses taught are in the team planner- and each teacher focuses on a different subject . You could also setup a team for a particular course , either in your building or across the district . <p> While all lessons may be created in a team planner , it should not be the only source of lesson plans .

They can also be place holders for additional resources , activities , and documents linked in the Scope and Sequence tab . <p> Learning Standards can also be turned into Standard Groups . <p> Standard Groups bring a second layer to the organizational group folders . Any learning standard using this icon will display an expandable and collapsible option in the teacher curriculum pane and Scope and Sequence Tab . <p> Organizational Groups <p> Organizational groups allow you to divide a course 's learning standards into a meaningful structure . Groups can be a time frame , such as a six-weeks , instructional units or both . The following outlines possible organization group structures : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Six Weeks <p> Third Six Weeks <p> Sample : Unit Organization <p> Unit 1 <p> Unit 2 <p> Unit 3 <p> Sample : Combination <p> First Six Weeks : Unit 1 <p> First Six Weeks : Unit 2 <p> Second Six Weeks : Unit 3 <p> Creating Organizational Groups <p> To create an organizational group : <p> Click the New Group button <p> Enter the name of the organization group <p> Click the Save button or hit the enter key <p> Repeat this process until all organization groups are added <p> Organizational groups will always appear at the bottom of the list . <p> Associating TEKS Courses <p> Forethought courses are aligned to single or multiple TEKS courses to link learning standards to the TEKS . Although in most cases , each course will be linked to one TEKS course and each learning standard will be linked to one TEKS objective , there may be situations where you will want to combine courses or combine learning standards . <p> To link a Forethought course with a TEKS course : <p> Select the Options tab on top <p> Navigate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Check the associated course <p> Click the Select Courses button <p> Creating Learning Standards <p> Learning standards are stored in organizational groups and at least one organizational group must exist . Learning standards , like courses , do not become active until you publish them . This allows you to work and update a course without impacting teachers and the active curriculum . <p> Activities are linked to learning standards so caution should be taken when editing or removing learning standards that have been published . Changing the meaning of a learning standard can also have a negative impact if teachers have used the standard in their planners . <p> To add a new learning standard : <p> Click the New Standard button <p> Enter the text of the learning standard <p> Select the desired standard decorator <p> Select any associated TEKS objectives <p> Click the Save button <p> Moving and Copying Learning Standards <p> Learning standards can be moved and copied within the same course or to another course , if appropriate . When a learning standard is copied , a new standard is created and existing activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the same course or to another course will move its activities . However , in order for TEKS associations to be moved , the destination course must be associated with the appropriate TEKS course . <p> To move a learning standard : <p> Select the standard to be moved <p> Click and hold on the selected standard <p> Drag and drop the standard onto a group or another standard <p> The standard will appear at the bottom of the group or just below another standard <p> You can also use the- Copy- and Paste buttons on the toolbar .
