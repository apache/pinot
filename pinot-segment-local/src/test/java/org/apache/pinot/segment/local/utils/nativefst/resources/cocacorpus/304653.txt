@@44422503 @4422503/ <h> The Art of Wynwood Cigar Factory <p> Miami , FL June 4 , 2013 Miami might have Little Havana , but its Wynwood Arts District that is making its way to be the next major cigar producer in the city. - You mightve seen the incredible new- Evoca1 mural on the side of a building in Wynwood that looks to be an art warehouse , and it is in a way , but what you probably do n't  know is that its home to the- Wynwood Cigar Factory . Once you set foot on the property , you 'll notice the distinct aroma of tobacco wafting through the air , and if you wander inside , you 'll see everything being rolled up right before your eyes by native Hondurans . To add to an already captivating visual , these workers sit at bright , beautifully colored hand-painted desks , with three of the four walls in the huge space covered with artistic murals . It would n't be Wynwood without the art , and this place takes cigar making to a whole new level , weaving in the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who better to breathe life back into one of South Floridas earliest industries than a Miami native ? Robert Caldwell is the guy who brought this vision to reality with his partner Christian Eiroa . Just this past January they opened the factory for manufacturing , making it just barely six months old . Caldwell grew up in Coral Gables and has a great love for Miami , wanting to put it back on the map as a cigar producing city . He started smoking at the age of 12 and successfully started The Hotel Humidor company five years ago to service cigars to hotel groups . When Eiroa sold his big enterprise , - Camacho Cigars , he wanted to team up with Caldwell because he had been the only one able to make hospitality cigars work . <p> Caldwells love for cigars and Miami come through in this project , which already has an extensive reach outside of Florida . Almost all of the cigars manufactured in Wynwood are shipped to retailers and hospitality groups elsewhere , with only some of the very exclusive product being sold here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sits on a 1,500 acre tobacco farm , which provides a lot of the leaves , and even the workers , found in Wynwood . The 5,000 square foot warehouse is a cigar factory , lounge , and art gallery all in one , making it a unique commodity that brings something new to the up-and-coming neighborhood . Take a tour of the space with Caldwell himself , and learn just how the Wynwood Cigar Factory sets itself apart from the rest by staying true to the art of cigar making while simultaneously showcasing local artists . <p> Robert Caldwell <p> " When you think about cigars , you think of all these countries- Cuba , Dominican Republic- you do n't  think of a brand . The purpose is to give Miami a born-and-bred brand . Wynwood is the new Miami , so the new Miami brand needs to be from Wynwood . When most people think of Miami , they think of little hole in the wall factories- the whole manufacturing district of Little Havana is just bullsh*t . " <p> " This is the Escaparate room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ready ; they just sit here and relax anywhere from six to 24 hours before getting shipped . " <p> The Escaparate room has bags of scrap tobacco left over from manufacturing the high-end cigars . Usually people sell it , but its too good to just be sold like that . Caldwell tells us that theyll probably end up using it to make a cheaper cigar later on , like a cigarillo . <p> These boxes store and air out the three core tobaccos received from the factory in Honduras . Ligero is the strongest , with a pepper and spice flavor , that acts as mostly filler for the inside of the cigar . Pelo de Oro comes from Peru and adds more sweetness to the cigar . Habano is brought in from Nicaragua , adding a smooth , caramel , buttery component . <p> Robert Caldwell <p> " Each of the three main lines of cigars made in the factory blends a variety of these leaves . The farm which they 're sent from in Honduras has various micro-climates within the 1,500 acres . From one end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out completely different . Variations in priming , height of the leaf on the plant , and the age all make up a different blend of flavors . " <p> Caldwell and his partner had a vigorous hiring process for the exclusive factory . Since Miami is n't exactly a destination city for hiring cigar manufacturing , they held a competition in Honduras with 5,000 rollers . To find the best of the best , they then narrowed it down to 300 rollers based on the cosmetics of the cigars . After that , the structure was the second criteria , narrowing it down to just 50 . Then , these 50 were unidentifiably different to the eye and feel , so they rolled a second cigar . A machine was used to test the air resistance of the inside of the cigar , bringing it down to the final 20 rollers who had the perfect product . The first eight rollers are here on 15-month Cultural Exchange visas , with the second wave coming soon . They have to keep switching them out , a tedious process , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first step in the rolling process is to create what 's called a bunch . Its prepared with an- assistant tool used in Central America that makes the cigar burn a lot better . Some purists argue that the entire process should be done completely by hand , but that also gives a greater number of returns and a lower quality cigar . This is the one tool that they 've been able to integrate to assist them . He takes five of the whole leaves , puts them into the tobacco binder , and rolls them . <p> The binder leaf is very important : its the one used on the outside of the roll that holds it all together and gives most of the initial flavor . <p> Then he uses a mold to shape them all uniformly . The cigars all get put into the slots , he puts the top on it , and stacks them . He applies a certain amount of pressure , usually until it stops twisting easily , adds an extra spin to it , and will just let them rest in there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove them . <p> Robert Caldwell <p> After they 're released from the mold , the cap is made . The roller , in this case it was a woman , takes a cylindrical tool to cut out a circle shape from the leaf . All of the cigars here use what 's called a triple cap to seal the cigar . Its a Cuban method . They use vegetable glycerin- a cellulose plant base that 's flavorless and colorless- to seal the cap . Its a very intricate and delicate process . <p> Once the cap is made , she then has a little tool to cut the cigar . She calibrates it to the desired size , then cuts it . <p> You can see the three distinct lines of the cap , hence its called a triple cap . Its a more detailed process than most cigars , which just use a single cap . You also never want to cut a cigar below the cap , just off the tip , or else you 'll lose all the flavor when smoking it . <p> While the labels are all printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having paint splattered on them . That way , no two are the same , and it gives an extra artistic feel to the finished product . <p> Theres thermometers in the factory to constantly gauge the humidity percentage in the room . If it goes below 65% , sprinklers come on to mist the room and create some dampness so the product does n't  dry out . The humidity stays between 65 and 70% . <p> Once they 're rolled and ready , they sit in the Escaparate room for a few hours or overnight . The sorting trays distinguish which cigars were rolled and on what day . <p> They then go into their boxes . On the outside of every box there 's a label with all the information : who made the cigars , what 's in the blend , the brand name , the size , and what date they were packaged- which is the very last thing . Wynwood Cigar Factorys three " crown jewels " , as Caldwell refers to them , are : Granada , Coneja , and Rout . <p> Robert Caldwell <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorda . The perfect moment to smoke one is anytime you have time to smoke . Its not something you do when youre rushed . Theyre meant for times of leisure . People smoke cigarettes because they 're addicted , but people smoke cigars to relax . Its like having a glass of wine . You 're not going to just pour it and chug it , but if its a time where you can sit down , put your feet up , and really enjoy it , that 's when you smoke . For me , I like being in my car with music or here , but not when I 'm running around . " <p> " I like my job because I like being able to innovate . I like when people tell me I cant do something . When I decided to build this factory , everybody said it was cool , but they did n't  think people would get it . Even still , people are skeptical to what I 'm doing here , and I like to prove them wrong . I like to do things my way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner , because we have to agree on everything . Everything we do has to be top-tier , from the humidification to the label that goes on the cigar , the wrapping , the box sticker Sometimes its a struggle and takes more time and energy , but if we want to be different , we have to do it right . " <p> The main artist collaboration is with Evoca1 , who has two murals outside on the factory walls . He created the original logo and boxes for the Wynwood Miami cigars , and just went with the team to do some murals in Ohio . The factory really puts an emphasis on local artists and their work not only by featuring them on the packaging , but also by putting the artists name and website as a way to promote them too . Its very much a mutual relationship . <p> Raul Flores designed all the Wynwood Honduras boxes and even painted a table that sits in the factory and is worked off of daily . <p> All the artists are locals , keeping with the mentality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny Cordero , a Miami local who 's also known as " Love the Bear " , did a limited edition set of boxes for the Miami outpost . <p> The quirky doll pictures that hang in the factory come from local artist Marcello Ibanez .
