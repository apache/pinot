Never purchase or wear a helmet without ensuring a snug fit . There are several methods and tricks to size a helmet . <p> To measure your head size , wrap a cloth tape measure horizontally around your head about one inch above your eyebrows and ears . This will measure the largest portion of your head . <p> Select the helmet size that is closest to your head size . Often times your head measurement may fall between two helmet sizes . When this occurs you should first try the smaller size . <p> When wearing a helmet , it should be snug . If it is not snug , it is too big for you . With the helmet on and chin strap fastened , if you can move the helmet easily from side to side and up and down without moving your head , the helmet is too big . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmets fit different head shapes . A helmet that will fit one person perfectly may not fit another person with the same size head , due to the shapes of their heads being different <p> HOW TO MEASURE JACKET SIZING <p> Sleeve Start with measuring your sleeve length . With your arm slightly bent , start from your neck bone , measure over your shoulder and elbow points , and end at the wrist bone . This is also called Center Back ( CB ) Sleeve length . <p> Chest Next measure your chest . You will want the total circumference of your chest at it 's largest point .

If the measured size of your hand is in between sizes of the gloves that interest you , choose the size larger if you want a loose fit and the smaller size if you like a tighter fit .

Do n't Buy Used Headgear : This can not be stated enough . Used headgear is not a safe investment , because , as these protective pieces age , their parts start breaking down .
