Because of the success of NEDP for adults in New York , the program expanded to other states as an alternative option for adults to earn a high school diploma . In 1979 , the U.S. Department of Education , through the National Diffusion Network ( NDN ) recognized the NEDP as an exemplary program worthy of national dissemination . On July 1 , 2006 , CASAS Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment Systems with assistance from the Connecticut , Maryland , and New York State Departments of Education acquired the rights to the NEDP.

The NRS began in the late 1990s , in response to the trend toward greater accountability , for both adult education and employment programs . With a system designed to demonstrate program effectiveness and improve student outcomes , the NRS provides a means of regular evaluation for adult education nationwidefor states , programs , teachers , and students . <p> In August 1998 , the voluntary nature of the NRS changed when the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act within the Workforce Investment Act ( WIA P.L. 105-220 ) became law . Mandatory statewide implementation of NRS began in 1999 . In 2000 states began submitting their student and program outcomes to the NRS .

Students discuss the importance of class attendance , working in groups , and setting long and short-term goals . The class was created in 2008 to address Florins low ESL persistence rates , which was due to irregular attendance , lack of study skills or lack of unrealistic goals . One common barrier to persistence , gained from student feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ESL class and felt uncomfortable entering the new environment alone . The ESL Orientation/Success Class gives students the opportunity to form a peer group even before starting regular ESL classes . Many of the students that attend the same Orientation/Success Class continue support each other while in ESL classes . This promising practice exemplifies the importance of targeting a problem and implementing comprehensive changes to fix that problem . In the end , ESL students at Florin Tech Center are better prepared and more excited about entering adult education classes . 108067 @qwx308067 <p> Since implementing the ESL Orientation/Success Class , there has been a significant increase in learner persistence . The percentage of students attending ESL classes for 20 or more hours at Florin Technology Education Center has increased from 75% to 89% since the implementation of the class . The agency surpassed the 2008-09 California student-level performance for all but one ESL instructional level .

Are you confused by the debate about whether these assessments should report results as " scale scores " or " grade level equivalents " ? The truth is , grade level equivalents reference the wrong performance indicators , report performance on a less relevant scale for adults , and do n't tell you what you think they do . The main reason some people prefer grade level equivalents to IRT scale scores is they think grade level equivalents are more comprehensible to a lay audience . But even this is not true .

This program began as a pilot program in 2005-2006 , in order to improve student retention and make administrative procedures more efficient . While at first it was difficult to get student " buy-in " for the managed enrollment procedures , the agency learned that after the first few terms , students were accustomed to the registration procedures and have since been prepared at the beginning of each course term . <p> Agency awarded : Burbank Adult School , 2009 <h> Summary Description of Project : <p> Burbanks managed enrollment program involves a variety of administrative and instructional procedures , such as : <p> Beginning and end dates for course terms , in which students must sign up for classes within a given period of time , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students entering the program late .

Because students enter the classes after being pre-tested , instructors can begin the class right away and the classroom experience is much more streamlined . The multi-level classes provide individualized instruction , and provide students with valuable tools and knowledge for their future classes .

@@28418932 @2118932/ <h> The Challenge <p> TeamBuilders Academy ( TBA ) is a Prince Georges Community College Workforce Development Program that offers cohort-based accelerated adult career training . The challenge the academy was facing dealt specifically with pre- and post-workforce literacy assessment . TBA needed to evaluate its program not only to determine if it was achieving its missions and goals but to determine if it was enhancing and developing participants employability competency skills , particularly in reading and math . <h> The Solution <p> The CASAS Employability Competency Skill ( ECS ) Appraisal is one of the assessments the TBA used to determine if individuals have the minimum reading and math literacy required for TBA admission . After individual(s) have been accepted into the TBA , they take a CASAS ECS pretest to determine specific workforce literacy skill deficiencies . Based on the pretest results , participants go through an Instructional phase of approximately 150 hours . Finally , the ECS post-tests determine overall learning gains . <h> The Outcome <p> The Outcome is that the TBA has a unique program training model designed to be nationally benchmarked and supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretest , and post-test . Furthermore , participants who achieve the highest ECS levels can earn a Workforce Skill Certification , through CASAS , which is indeed an added benefit specifically for the unemployed , underserved , and under-skilled population that TBA serves .

At 17 , I returned to BOCES , but the streets were calling me and I abandoned my goal . " She returned to BOCES againonly to quit when she had a bad experience . Motivated by her daughter , she returned a third time to BOCES . She struggled with her writing but stayed with it .

" I believe my first step was really the decision to return to school and get my high school diploma no matter what problems or complications came my way . This was my most important lesson in life . I just completed my first semester ( 15 credits ) at Suffolk Community College where I earned a GPA of 3.2 .

" To my fellow graduates , all of us have different roles , but now we have taken a big step and earned our high school diploma . I 'm sure you have different ideas about where you are going or what you will do next , but do n't  give up , because this is a great country and I believe there is opportunity for all of us ...

This class creates a strong pathway for students to enter the health care field . <p> Agency Awarded:San Diego Community College District , 2010 108078 @qwx308078 <p> San Diego CCD created a Personal Care Assistant/Caregiver Class based on the I-BEST model of instruction . Students receive Vocational ESL ( VESL ) instruction and vocational training at the same time , which provides a more focused curriculum designed to transition students into the workforce or continued education . This class was created due to a high demand in the community for Personal Care Assistants . San Diego CCD decided to follow the I-BEST model , used in Washington State , in order to eliminate the need for students to attend a VESL course before the vocational training course . This class is team-taught by both a VESL instructor and a vocational instructor . They work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then use those new language skills to learn practical application of the concepts . Students have both hands-on training to prepare them for the workplace as well as intensive curriculum to understand all of the material . This class creates a bridge for ESL students to enter the health care field , and ensures that they are prepared for the workplace . 108067 @qwx308067 <p> The original class was taught in the Fall of 2009 , and had a beginning enrollment of 54 students . Of these students , 44 students completed the class and earned a certificate of completion , 11 students enrolled in a Certified Nursing Assistant class and will graduate in June , and at least 5 have secured employment as caregivers . San Diego CCD exceeded the 2008-09 California state persistence level of 58.0% with a level of 63.2% , and has shown improvement in student performance in ESL levels over the past three program years .
