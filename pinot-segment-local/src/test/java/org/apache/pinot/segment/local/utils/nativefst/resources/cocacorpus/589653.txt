How do you keep your succulents alive in the first place ? ! <p> This post may contain affiliate links <p> After a disastrous first round ( RIP ) I have managed to keep my second lot of succulents alive .

One of them even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention they 're hardy little guys ? <h> 8 Key Steps To Keeping Indoor- Succulents Alive <p> Space . Avoid overcrowding . I 'm guilty of this , especially if I buy a pre-arranged dish garden . I later re-pot them if they begin to suffer . Your succulents need space to breathe and grow . There 's nothing stopping you planting multiple succs in one terrarium/container just make sure they are n't  on top of one another . Even succulents like personal space . <p> Light . Give them enough of it . Because succulents are hardy and need less watering than normal plants , people tend to think they do n't  need to be cared for in other areas either . Do n't  neglect your babies ! Succulents love light just not direct sunlight . Make sure they are positioned to get a few hours of light a day . If your plants do n't  get enough light theyll stretch toward the light and get leggy . This is a good time to propagate . <p> Temperature . Make sure they 're warm enoughand cool enough ! Succulents like to be warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ventilation . If you can , have some air flow around your plants . An open window or where all else fails , an air vent . This helps with the draining/drying of the soil and you can keep track of their watering needs . <p> Watering . Do n't  over-water . Succulents only need to be watered when their soil is completely dry so check if the soil is still soggy before their next drink ! <p> Drainage . They love well draining , gritty soil . Ideally your container of choice needs to have a drainage hole so that the soil does n't  remain soggy and drown your succulents . <p> Food . Give them a treat ! Get a plant food made specifically for cacti &amp; succulents and feed them once in a while . <p> Species . Knowing which varieties you have and their specific needs is a good start to knowing how to keep them alive . <p> I think the thing I neglect most is the food .

@@48796217 @2296217/ <p> Before I met my husband I liked to think I was relatively in tune with who I was as a person . Fun fact : I was n't . At all . <p> Marrying the military ( because let 's face it , your relationship with the Army ends up being more demanding than the relationship with your spouse ) taught me a lot about myself and better still , inspired me take a good hard look at my weaknesses and change a little . <p> Change ? Yeah , yeah . " A leopard never changes his spots " , " once a . , always a . " and all those other bitter , overused phrases . Well I call BS on that . I think people are so conditioned into thinking that change or personal growth is beyond the realm of attainability that they have become utterly relentless in their views . Well sorry Mr. Pessimist but personal growth is a realistic and achievable concept ! If were the first to point out someone changing in a negative sense , why cant we acknowledge the positive ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you someone like me who likes to have a plan ? You are ? Great . Well forget it . In the military its almost impossible to plan the time you can sit down to dinner let alone a date or a trip away . All this is dependent on your significant others particular- job of course but in this life flexibility is a must . Having a vision of what you want to do is fine but carefully executed plans rarely come to fruition which often leads to disappointment . Some people fly by the seat of their pants and are perfectly fine living day to day . I , however , like to plan things to a tee and unfortunately to cope with this , it is often best for me to fear the worst case scenario rather than feel deflated , daily . Its not everyones cup of tea and probably not the healthiest coping mechanism but I 've found myself a lot less disappointed and better again , a lot less angry . <h> Adaptability <p> If your service member is a lifer ( 20+ year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably move tens of times throughout your marriage . No mean feat ! Even if you are associated with the military for a short time then the chances of living in three or four different places is realistic . Moving so often is NOT easy , aside from the usual moving headaches it creates obstacles concerning the education of your children , the length of your career ( or if you 'll even be able to have one ) , the quality of- your relationships to name but a few . Youve got to be able to pack up and move your life in a very short time period and there 's also the possibility of a short-notice deployment in which you very suddenly find yourself spouse-less and/or a single mother for many months . <h> Strength <p> Its pretty obvious from what Ive mentioned above that being strong is n't a choice in the military . Its an absolute necessity . <p> Were all human though . Do we have ridiculous moments of weakness where we cry in our driveways- because its late at night , the dog has stepped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're trying to wash his paw with so unsuccessfully that you then think he s choking because you 're pulling so hard on his collar to get him to STAY STILLLLLLLL and you only have two hands ? <p> Yes that happens . Or so someone told me . <h> Gratitude <p> The harder my life has become as a result of being involved with the military , the greater the appreciation I have for everything , really. - My surroundings , my family , my friends , all of the wonderful things I am fortunate to have like my own home and the ability to travel extensively . It changes your view of what matters . Being grateful for the smallest things is a blessing that comes from the darker moments when you feel the worst you ever have in your whole life . <h> Knowing What 's Important <p> None of us are invincible , this we know but military life is sobering . The value of supportive family and friends is a lesson learned immediately . Most people on any military installation are nowhere near their families and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system nearby is extremely tough and the friends you will make along your military journey can be friends for life . On the other hand , military towns can be some of the trashiest and most dramatic places you will find yourself . Unless you 're that way inclined , stay out of this . It will do nothing for your happiness and you wo n't find friends or genuine support in these people . I highly recommend making new friends but thread carefully until you 're comfortable trusting them . <p> Being the spouse of a service member undoubtedly changes you . I simultaneously love and hate every second of this journey but if given the choice , I would n't change a thing . It truly is the making of who I am . <p> Ah , the comfort zone . That safe place where the only feelings you feel are warm and fuzzy . If you suddenly find yourself married to a service member you will know that your comfort zone is all but a distant memory . A place , that once in your life was a certainty until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland , totally ignorant to the culture that comes with a large scale military . When I met my husband , I saw him as any other normal guy but it did n't  take me long to realize that as well as the cultural differences associated with our places of birth I was also dunked without warning into the vastly complicated world of the US Army and earned the title military spouse . <h> The Most Overwhelming Aspects Of Military Life For The New Military Spouse <h> Equipment <p> Your childhood garage once housed tools and bicycles but yours now contains tough boxes and over-flowing rucksacks stacked to the ceiling . <p> His closet is filled with dress uniforms , covers , camouflage uniforms , tan t-shirts , PTs and huge muddy boots . Then he comes home and announces that there 's a new uniform coming out . Enter more of the above and expect to find the old stuff crammed into every spare space in your home/garage . <p> There 's a box somewhere that should be full of name tapes , patches , awards and the ruler to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always missing . <h> Terminology <p> Hell text you to say that he " has to do a brief at the Motor Pool with the CSM at sixteen hundred " . WHAT ? Or life changing conversations like " After he attends CCC you will PCS to Fort X to take command " . Again , WHAT ? <p> I mustve been with my husband for four years when I still found myself asking him what he even does all day . ( I have since found out , sort of ! ) <p> The terminology is difficult to get used to but I assure you , you will learn . Have patience ( both of you ! ) , it takes time . Ask your partner to explain the acronyms , rank and general structure of the military . There 's an awful lot but its not to difficult to understand . See it as an opportunity to learn a new language of sorts . <h> Rank <p> This one comes back to the structure . There 's a basic split : Enlisted and Officers and within each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their symbols here . Like with anything in the Army there are certain rules attached with who can be associated with who , socially . Fortunately for spouses there is no rank ! <h> Etiquette <p> Whether its stopping what you are doing ( to include driving ) to face the flag at retreat , walking on his left side while in uniform to allow him to salute if needed or not wearing a piece of his uniform all military spouses should be familiar with the dos and donts of military etiquette . <h> Deployments <p> The word all military families fear most , deployment . Anywhere from a few months to a year , your spouse could be deployed oversees and you will be left to take the reins on everything . He could miss birthdays , holidays and even the birth of babies . Unfortunately its a real and present part of being an active-duty service member . Read about our long distance story , here . There are many resources online that serve as guides and support for coping with deployment . I personally like Jo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the key to a good marriage is honesty and communication . Unfortunately in the military , your significant other may not be able to share everything about his job with you . This can be frustrating . Do n't  take it personally he probably feels immense pressure just from not being able to tell you . <h> Sacrifices <p> He makes many just by choosing a career in the military but boy , oh , boy will you make sacrifices ! You first give up your home and family to be by your S/Os side and more often than not you will also give up your own career in order to move around . Of course it is n't the end of your career if you do n't  want it to be . Many military spouses own their own portable businesses and many are homemakers and home schoolers . The list and opportunities are endless . It is entirely up to you . For someone like me with a mechanical engineering degree , it is difficult to manage a full-time career when your location is so disposable . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To put abruptly you do n't  ! Plans are for missions . Your home life however , tends to be up in the air until the last minute . Military life changes as quickly as the Irish weather !

There are certain stereotypes associated with military spouses . Some more derogatory than others . Gossip and drama persists at a rampant pace . Toxic people do n't  belong in your life . Steer clear of people who exist only to make others lives miserable . This is not a community in which we should tear one another down . Support is key among military spouses and contrary to some stories you might hear , you will make some of the best friends you will ever meet on your military journey . <h> Realizing How Strong You Are <p> I do n't  give myself enough credit for how strong I am in this whirlwind life . Nor do other friends I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the verge of tears , biting your lip to stop from FREAKING OUT about the latest piece of information he has brought home .

Then you will become a crazy succulent lady which quite frankly I think is far more economical than a crazy cat lady . <p> Those of you who follow the blog and/or my Pinterest will know about my new found love of succulents .

He redeemed himself though by buying me a beautiful Pachyveria and a prickly but cute , climbing Aloe . <p> Of course that couldnt be the end of the story . As I was shooting photos for this post I went out to the back porch where my Aloe was sunning itself and I found my brazen-faced Labradoodle out there munching its roots ! Soil everywhere and a mouth full of roots , that Dood RAN , fast . Watch this space for a post on the fate of my Aloe which I semi-saved and re-potted . <h> Propagating Succulents <p> Propagating my succulents was n't on my agenda just yet but alas , its time . I sadly disposed of my shriveled leaves and trimmed what healthy stems remained . Placing the cuttings aside , I removed any healthy leaves I could salvage by carefully wiggling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eceheveria Pearl von Nurnberg which saddened me as it was so beautiful ! Once you have all stems and leaves that you want to propagate , you will need to leave them to dry away from bright light for a few days to a week . After they are dried and have calloused you can place them in a shallow dish or tray that has a layer of well draining soil ( mixed with sand and small pebbles ) . Dampen the soil but do not drown it . Watch the magic happen ! Within a week you should see tiny succulents budding from the parent leaf/stem . The parent leaf will loosen after a while and it can be easily removed . This is when you can plant your brand new succulents ! <p> It is said that when life hands you lemons you should make lemonade . When life hands you a husband who ca n't keep your succulents alive , propagate more ! <p> Firstly , I have to say- succulents are simple adorable ! They come in all shapes and sizes and are incredibly resilient little things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearing in bridal bouquets , home decor and can even be given as stunning homemade gifts ! <h> CALLING ALL PLANT MURDERERS ! <p> Do you love the idea of house plants or garden flower beds but have a bad case of the black thumb ? Then succulents might be for you ! What 's better than living art that virtually takes care of itself ? ! <h> How To Keep Succulents <h> Planting <p> The key to planting succulents is proper drainage . They can thrive in virtually any container but without sufficient drainage your succulent will die- from sitting in soggy soil . If your chosen container does not have drainage holes or where holes can not be drilled , a pebble drainage system must exist . Placing pebbles beneath the soil in the bottom of your container will allow water to run out of the soil so it can dry out . Succulents tend to have shallow roots and small containers are best . If planting in a large container I would advise you to use some form of filler . The more soil in the container , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below for some pretty planting ideas . <h> Care <p> Just because Cacti are part of the succulent family do n't  assume all varieties can withstand extremely hot conditions . Succulents like bright sunlight but NOT direct sunlight . This is important as they will scorch ! These little guys are built to withstand drought and only need to be watered whenever the soil has completely dried out from the last watering . If you cant tell when its time , stick your finger in the soil to make sure . Try to water the soil not the plant . Be gentle , do n't  flood it ! <h> Propagation <p> There are n't  many flowers that will flourish elsewhere when snipped from the original ! This is what I love about succulents they are super easy to multiply ! You can read about succulent propagation here . <h> My Succulent Babies <h> Get Creative ! <p> There is no end to the quirky solutions you can find for planting succulents .

I 'm guilty of this , especially if I buy a pre-arranged dish garden . I later re-pot them if they begin to suffer . Your succulents need space to breathe and grow . There 's nothing stopping you planting multiple succs in one terrarium/container just make sure they are n't  on top of one another . Even succulents like personal space . <p> Light . Give them enough of it . Because succulents are hardy and need less watering than normal plants , people tend to think they do n't  need to be cared for in other areas either . Do n't  neglect your babies ! Succulents love light just not direct sunlight . Make sure they are positioned to get a few hours of light a day . If your plants do n't  get enough light theyll stretch toward the light and get leggy . This is a good time to propagate . <p> Temperature . Make sure they 're warm enoughand cool enough ! Succulents like to be warm in the Summer and cooler in the Winter months . <p> Ventilation . If you can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window or where all else fails , an air vent .

You want to scream it from the roof tops while simultaneously wanting to not tell anyone out of- sheer worry . In our social media age a tendency to share every facet of lives exists for many . Whether its a status on Facebook , a photo on Instagram or a witty one liner on twitter its so easy to share your excitement without fully acknowledging exactly who can see it . I admit it myself that sometimes I snap a photograph with social media in mind and not solely to capture a memory . <p> Let 's be honest , many of use have friends on social media we would n't exactly consider to be close . Platforms like twitter and Instagram can invite literally anyone to view your content . This is why for the most part I have n't documented too many milestones of my pregnancy on the blog . I find it rather eerie to think about who might be reading about such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read blogs daily where people go into graphic detail about the inner workings of their womb . Some announce their pregnancy on the day they discover it . Others declare the gender of their baby to the public . I have even seen some publish teaser posts inviting readers to guess babys name ! This is definitely a different pregnancy world to the one I knew growing up . Or at least the one I thought I knew . I personally am more private about my pregnancy . It is overwhelmingly exciting but I would rather contain that excitement within the bounds of my family and friends . <p> My crux with baring all throughout pregnancy however is not what I read online . I take no issue with what women choose to post and fully admit to thoroughly enjoying many of these posts ! My problem lies with the people I meet in the street <p> Whether it is due to being surrounded by such open accounts of pregnancy or just a- general sense of entitlement I have been taken aback by some of the questions I am asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popped and my pregnancy became apparent , I noticed that some people took it as a green light to ask pretty personal questions .

I do not believe that because some people happily announce their babys gender that it is free game in every other pregnancy . What makes people think they have a right to such a deeply intimate fact ? <p> Another question comes with this one and it is , " Do you know but are n't  saying ? " or " Do you reeeeeeally not know ? " . <p> STOP IT . If you have been given a firm , " we have n't found out " then please accept it and move on . <p> What names are you thinking of ? <p> Note , this is n't the question " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to know what those names are . BEFORE YOUR BABY ARRIVES . The baby is going to come out of me faster and more easily than that information . Keep walking . <p> When are you due ? because you 're tiny *stares at bump* <p> Admittedly , this is not an offensive question at all . However it is when paired with a disapproving glance at your belly and a comment about your size . Please stop skinny shaming me . I am 6ft tall and there 's plenty of torso for baby to hide in . FYI my baby is slightly above normal fetal growth rate ! Relax . <p> I 've had three children . I did not know if they were boys or girls the first two timessometimes people just do n't  know !

Personal space , people ! <p> ( My youngest child is 11 so all of this happened before most social media thankfully ! ) <p> I had my daughter before the www age , so this was a non-issue . But I definitely hear what you 're saying . My work has very vulnerable aspects , so I share a lot online ; however , I give myself permission to be vulnerable , but not intimate . I use that as a gauge for what to share and what to keep . <p> I 'm currently ( almost ) 33weeks with our second and , just like the first , were not telling anyone what names we are even considering !

@@48796226 @2296226/ <p> This year was our first Labor Day weekend without a plan . Initially we honed in on Florida . Sick of excessive heat and humidity , we changed our plans on a whim and booked a trip to Northern Georgia . How lucky we were ! Florida was a no-go thanks to Tropical Storm Hermine ripping her way right through the state and unfortunately for us , our home was also in her direct path . We left a night early to avoid driving through the storm . On our agenda for the weekend was visiting Helen , Tallulah Gorge State Park , Tallulah Falls , eating some good food and playing a round of golf ! Nothing too wild ! It turned into an interesting trip <p> Helen , Georgia is an Alpine town with a Bavarian feel right in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains . Apparently with a population of just 430 , Helen is the third most visited town in Georgia ! After spending so many years traveling around Bavaria , I must admit it does have a genuine Bavarian feel . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their old German duty station ! <p> Fussen , Bavaria is the town we would stay at whenever we visited Schloss Neuschwanstein where we got engaged . I was excited to find out that Helen is her sister city ! <p> The architecture and decor is undeniably Bavarian . <p> We ate at a really authentic German restaurant called Bodensee on the outskirts of town . To find it just cross the bridge on the main street and make an immediate left . Schnitzel after two years without it , really hit the spot ! <p> We spent a few hours walking around Helen , visiting the stores , eating and of course having a Bier ! There 's a large parking area with $5/day parking which I do n't  think is a bad deal . However if you are staying in Helen then there 's no need to move your car from the hotel . The majority of the hotels are no more than a 10 minute walk away . There 's a lot to do in Helen and around its outskirts . One fun family activity is tubing on the Chattahoochee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Labor day each year , a fest not to be missed ! <p> Our accommodation destination was Clayton , Georgia . A small town near Tallulah Falls . I wo n't talk about where we stayed because frankly , it does n't  deserve a review . It was the downfall of our trip and we were definitely disappointed to find that it was nothing like advertised and was exorbitantly expensive for the condition it was in . If you like luxury hotel stays , it is very easy to be fooled by fancy ( edited ) pictures and exaggerated descriptive words . still , we decided to make the most of it and not let the hotel get us down . <p> That night we decided not to bother eating at our destination and instead ventured into Clayton to The Laurel restaurant at The White Birch Inn . The White Birch Inn is a boutique hotel in the historic part of town and I just about died over the decor in there . It all made sense when I read the owner is an interior designer ! If only wed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ! Tallulah Gorge State Park is located in the town of Tallulah Falls , just 20 minutes away from Clayton . I was excited for this for a while but I was initially disappointed by how short the trails were . Do n't  get me wrong there are many trails but the best and most fun are for experienced hikers with real deal equipment . Someone I am not . So only two trails were available to me and my abilities . We found that one of those ( South Rim trail ) was a no-go due to a 600 step descent , something that was unfortunately a health concern for me at the time . <p> I must also add that if you are one of those hardcore hikers planning to visit the park this Autumn to hike to the gorge basin where the sliding rock/beach area is , it is closed due to dam maintenance until Memorial Day of 2017 . <p> The paths are easy and quite open ( I was worried about this due to the many snakes inhabiting the park ) . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wary of . In wet weather it can be pretty soft and slippery . Obviously appropriate footwear is a necessity . <p> If you do attempt the descent on the South Rim trail then you will arrive at the suspension bridge which allows you to cross the gorge . <p> We hiked he North Rim trail to Inspiration Point where your eyes are treated to this stunning view ! There 's a perfectly placed bench up there to sit and take it all in after your walk . This trail has a steep incline and while the path is n't difficult , it gets quite tough in hot weather . Despite the short trail ( 2.5 miles ) do not start it without water . <p> The beauty of the park is amazing . It was so nice to be away from the crippling humidity of coastal Georgia . To breathe in fresh air and hear the rush of the water from the various falls reminded me of home ! <p> The saving grace of our hotel was that it had a relatively decent golf course for my husband to play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  play .

That sounds really sad but I just really appreciate funky little coffee houses that are NOT serving me Starbucks . It turns out that The White Birch Inn also has an adjoining store/coffee shop call White Birch Provisions . Again I was in love with the design . It helped that the coffee and pastries were just as perfect ! <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358

Short dresses on me could be deemed a criminal offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my shins hot stuff !

Nothing says Goodbye , Winter ! like a pretty floral print and a little big of leg ! I instantly fell in love with the dress that ticked all the boxes . This dress not only showcases the bump adorably but also hides a multitude of sins and is SO comfortable .

I cant justify having a huge amount of decorations for just one night ( ok , yes ironic since Christmas is technically one day as well ) .

Due to the family of geckos that likes to move into all my front door wreaths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this indoors as wall decor ! If you are displaying the wreath inside then those spider legs pretty much secure themselves between the twigs . One less step score ! <p> Obviously these wreaths are supposed to be round ( duh ! ) but they are inexpensive and all vary . Choose wisely at the store . When you are ready to start , lay it flat on a table and decide what point will be the top ( where it will sit on the door hanger/nail ) . <p> After this you get to play with your webbing . I used a very small amount , stretching it to the max to ensure it looked more real . The more you use , the clumpier it will be .

You could also arrange it width ways across the bottom half or indeed , all over the entire wreath . <p> Next up spiders !

I think the worst kind of baby gear is the stuff that lasts five minutes and is then no longer of any use . Like a bassinet or a changing table . <p> I was lucky to have an old TV cabinet sitting in my garage that had the perfect potential for a changing unit . This was achieved by simply changing the color ! I was able to create a beautiful piece of furniture for the nursery that can be used as both a changing table and later , a storage unit . What I love about re-purposing a small cabinet is the versatility of the end result .

I have decided to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf which is usually for DVD players , game consoles and the like will be a place to store basics like onesies/bibs/burp cloths and the inevitable spare outfits we will need with some changes !

All I am really adding to this piece is a standard changing pad . <p> For such a huge transformation and total re-purpose , this project is the easiest I have ever done . It had two steps . <p> I have two words people . CHALK . PAINT . <p> Paint that magic potion directly onto your dust-free , un-sanded wood and watch it transform ! Granted , it took four or five coats but if you are not in a rush and have patience then you can get away without prepping .

In every situation , pregnant or not there is always one negative person who has nothing positive to say on the matter . In pregnancy , the same applies . Whether its strangers patting your belly or unsolicited advice , there 's plenty of negativity to fill your nine months and beyond . <p> I was home in Ireland briefly and sadly , I kind of regret going . Not because I received negativity but because I received support . I am aware that seems incredibly cynical and negative . I was finally able to share the pregnancy journey with those who seemed concerned , interested and happy for me . I can not describe the feeling of going through such a special time and being the only one invested in it . So I wont even try but it was very hard to leave a loving , familiar environment and return to one void of such happiness . <p> I have come to discover here that when I am in the company of others , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially go wrong . I spoke in my last post about struggling with my mental health throughout this pregnancy . The last thing any expectant first-time mother wishes to hear is what they are doing wrong or what will go wrong . It baffles me that at such a special time in life , the only sentiments offered are negative . With all due respect if you have nothing nice to say , then say nothing . <p> I understand that some people do n't  worry . I am a sensitive , intuitive person and worry comes with the territory . Do n't  get me wrong , I am confident in this pregnancy . If it werent for the external factors I would say I am loving it . But I have the normal apprehension that is to be expected when facing delivering your first baby . Fortunately , in my battalion I also have my intelligence , a strong maternal instinct and a drive to succeed . Maybe I internalize too much but I can not bear someone treating me like I know absolutely nothing . Condescending comments that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even seen an infant in my life . Negativity about the way I eat , drink or choose to care for myself during the gestation . Telling me with a loud cackle how my house will never be the palace it is now , again . UGH . <h> Like snowflakes , fingerprints and pregnancies we are all unique . <p> Why is it so hard to live and let live ? In my rant I have digressed . I have taken too long to realize that the health and well-being of myself and my child trumps literally everything else in my life . Giving these people power over your emotions is the worst way to manage . You must continue on boldly and bravely in your pregnancy . You are the mother . That intuition is strong for a reason . You know what is best for you and for baby . Embrace the positivity you receive . Be thankful for those people and their kind words , generosity and support . Give them the space in your head and heart . <h> Dealing With Negative Nancy During Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say thank you <p> Firmly but nicely state that you do not wish to discuss certain topics if they are too personal or invasive <p> Do n't  focus on the fact that your boundaries are being disrespected and allow it to become bitterness . Some people just truly believe they know everything <p> Try to remember that to them the advice is coming from a good place and not one of malice <p> Do n't  internalize it as condescension , often empty vessels simply make the most noise <p> I 'm sorry to hear that you have n't felt supported during your pregnancy . For me , one of the most important factors in having a healthy , sane pregnancy is surrounding yourself with like-minded people in the same situation , which can be difficult if none of your friends are pregnant at the same time . The bad news is that it gets much , much worse after the baby comes out .

I have no idea what it is about having a baby belly that makes peoples foot go straight into their mouths . I 'm pregnant with my 3rd and I truly think the only thing someone should say to a pregnant woman is " you look fabulous " . <p> Reminding myself that the advice is usually coming from a good place is definitely so so helpful . I 'm working on baby #2 currently , and people STILL treat me like I have no idea what I 'm doing . A polite smile and nod are usually what it comes down to for me , haha !

When you are entirely preoccupied with everything you must do to prepare for babys arrival , its easy to forget the monotonous things that still need tending to in our day to day lives . Who wants to have a newborn baby , be overwhelmed by motherhood and realize you have to go to the store for toilet paper ? Not this gal ! With just a couple of weeks left before babys arrival , I 'm sharing with you a list of things to get done that you will either have no time nor desire to do once baby arrives . <h> Your Hair ! <p> This one is n't the most important , I admit , but you deserve some pampering mama ! Its not easy waddling around feeling super uncomfortable 24/7 . Get your hair done and relish your glamorous locks before they 're full of spit up on the regular . Not to mention , finding 2-3 hours for a hair appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and important one would be to visit the dentist . Did you know that women are far more susceptible to dental problems during pregnancy ? Now is the time for a check-up or even just a clean . Who knows when you might get time to go again . <h> Make Lists <p> This is the crazy organized part of me shining through . I have compiled a list of family and friends numbers who we want to share the news of babys arrival with immediately . This helps to avoid forgetting someone when you 're running on endorphins and wont exactly be thinking of Uncle so and so who then gets super offended that he saw it on facebook . So make a list or yknow , tell everyone online and offend them all equally . Whatever your view is , its your baby ! <p> A perhaps more achievable list to compile is a list of recipients for your Thank You cards as you receive registry gifts . I did n't  have a baby shower but we were still flooded with gifts from family and friends . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sent you something . Rude ! Even if you do n't  do it as they arrive , be sure to send a birth announcement card with a thank you from baby attached . <h> Deep Clean <p> And by deep clean , I mean have your ever-so-gracious and helpful partner do it or hire someone . Do n't  attempt all that bending and scrubbing alone . Have rooms/closets organized , carpets shampooed , windows cleaned and basically any big Spring cleaning kind of task that more than likely will not get done with a newborn around . <p> Since January we have been taking a room or area of the house each week in which to deep clean blinds , window screen ledges , windows and baseboards . My husband has shampooed the carpets and we maintain a twice weekly quick and general cleaning of the whole house to keep it up . <h> Stockpile Household Necessities <p> 2 days postpartum is not the time to find out you have run out of bin liners , toilet paper , disinfectant etc . Have everything stocked up that you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be at the forefront of your mom brain . <p> I went to my local Sams Club and stocked up on TP , paper towels , trash bags , body wash , razor blades , toothpaste , pantry staples such as cereals , pasta , grains , sauces &amp; seasonings and also , a large freezer meat supply ! Im subscribed to diapers and other baby essentials on Amazon Prime so I can rest assured that will be taken care of . Basically all I will need weekly is fresh produce and dairy which my husband can help out with by quickly picking up on the way home from work . <h> Prepare The Car ( + Install Car Seat ) <p> Keep your vehicle pet hair free when babys due date is getting close ! We have an SUV that will be perfect for carting around babys gear but up until now its been the personal Uber car for our Labradoodle . Let 's just say he got WAY more lab than poodle and he sheds like a maniac every February or if he s just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car seat to ensure no floating Doodle hairs end up on the baby . Ew . Poor Darby is now limited to riding in less style in my husbands commute-to-work car . But he does n't  mind once he ends up at the park , the beach or his friend Olafs house ! <h> Prepare Freezer or Crockpot-Ready Meals <p> This one takes effort but oh goodness will it be worth it when you 're so tired you could crumple in a heap and cry ! I 'm a big supporter of the crockpot . That glorious device that I dump stuff into and can magically eat 8 hours later . Set aside an evening to plan your meals . Then spend a morning shopping for ingredients and the rest of the day assembling . Again , request help with this one . This is definitely a task where many hands make light work . Stock up on freezer bags and get to it . Itll be so satisfying to see your meals for a solid month or more all taken of ! You will be less tempted to order fast food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for new mothers , especially if nursing your baby . <h> Bonus + Often Overlooked Task ! <h> Make Arrangements for Pet Care <p> This gives me the most anxiety . Babies are n't  exactly known for their perfect , convenient arrival times on their exact due date . Were lucky to have the worlds best puppy sitter ! Shes flexible and ever so good to the Dood . Ensure you have someone lined up to take care of your pet . Decide whether they will take them to their place or stay at yours . These plans will be loose until the big day .

When you are ready to start , lay it flat on a table and decide what point will be the top ( where it will sit on the door hanger/nail ) . <p> After this you get to play with your webbing . I used a very small amount , stretching it to the max to ensure it looked more real . The more you use , the clumpier it will be .

Then succulents might be for you ! What 's better than living art that virtually takes care of itself ? ! <h> How To Keep Succulents <h> Planting <p> The key to planting succulents is proper drainage . They can thrive in virtually any container but without sufficient drainage your succulent will die- from sitting in soggy soil . If your chosen container does not have drainage holes or where holes can not be drilled , a pebble drainage system must exist . Placing pebbles beneath the soil in the bottom of your container will allow water to run out of the soil so it can dry out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . If planting in a large container I would advise you to use some form of filler . The more soil in the container , the longer it will take to dry out . See below for some pretty planting ideas . <h> Care <p> Just because Cacti are part of the succulent family do n't  assume all varieties can withstand extremely hot conditions . Succulents like bright sunlight but NOT direct sunlight . This is important as they will scorch ! These little guys are built to withstand drought and only need to be watered whenever the soil has completely dried out from the last watering .

Put on your best smile and your pointiest elbows and be prepared for an obnoxiously green , semi-racially offensive grand ol time ! I kid of course . Kind of . <p> On March 17th , the whole world seems to honor the Irish famous landmarks go green , parades are held and guinness flows more freely than usual . However , as far as parties go , America wins . You wo n't meet one American on St. Patricks Day whose Dads cousins husbands sisters mail man was Irish and therefore so are they . <h> Surviving St. Patricks Day in America <h> I-rish I Were IRISH <p> My husband always has a new anecdote for me and it cracks me up ! Now and again at his workplace my nationality will come up and the response has more than once been , " Oh really ? I 'm Irish too ! Where is she from ? ! " Now this would be a perfectly acceptable question if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , multiple people have now asked WHAT STATE I am from . Heres what 's wrong , Americans now claim Irish heritage so haphazardly that being Irish no longer means from the country . Its just a generic label and it can simply mean , Ohio . I 'm currently working my way through all fifty States in response . <h> BEGORRAH , BEGOSH , TOP O THE MORNIN <p> and all those other words and phrases that Irish people quite literally never say . They will be repeatedly shouted in your face if your nationality has been exposed . My personal tip for dealing with this is the Carlsberg response of " ci+nas , bothar , cail+n , bainne " . Irish people will know that in our native tongue this means nothing more than " silence , road , girl , milk " a collection of random words . Youve got to give the people what they want ! Tell them it means " you 've never met a nicer person " and be on your merry way . <h> DRUNKEN TOMFOOLERY <p> It sounds like a guys name ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) but in fact its the theme of the day . This is the more offensive aspect of the day for me . A lot of people in the US and beyond view drunken debauchery as the ONLY mark of a true Irishman . Mimic my accent and use stereotypical Irish-isms its fine . I do n't  take it personally because frankly I know a lot of these people genuinely like Ireland , the culture and the accent . They mean no real harm . But hearing that I 'm Irish and responding with a drunk related quip then I 'm going to get real mad , real fast ! Sometimes I like a drink . Sometimes I do n't  like a drink . Contrary to popular belief , holding an Irish passport does n't  mean I binge drink regularly and have Jameson flowing through my veins . <p> Again through my dear husband this wretched stereotype has reached me again and again .

Now should I be mad at that comment or that my friend seemed to be able to enjoy her drink with no rude comment attached at all ?

I probably should n't tell you that practically nobody in Ireland with the exception of small kids will wear green on March 17th ! But when in Romewear all the green you can ? <p> Remember to keep it clean people , weve already established the penchant for assuming were a nation of drunks but at kid friendly parades its probably best to keep your explicit t-shirts in the closet at home ! <h> PATTY , THE FORGOTTEN SISTER OF PATRICK <p> At least , that must be who she is because no Irishman is called Patty . Patty is short for Patricia , Paddy is short for Patrick . Those are the rules . " But there 's no T , it makes no sense !

Fortunately , youve all said Patty so much the leprechauns have suffered a massive decrease in population and wont be around to cause any pinch pains . <h> SHAMROCK NOT- FOUR LEAFED CLOVER <p> Shamrock was used to symbolize Christianity in Ireland and is an unofficial national symbol . Its not to be confused with the Harp which is our official national emblem and also not to be confused with a four leafed clover . Shamrock is a common three leafed clover , the four leafed version is said to be lucky because its harder to find. - The three leaves of the shamrock were used to symbolize the Holy Trinity by St. Patrick . On March 17th , people typically pin a small bunch of shamrock on their lapel or hat . Some do n't  know the meaning of small . <p> All jokes aside , America made St. Patricks Day what it is today and like anything they do , they attack it with gusto !

If drawing is not your forte then find a shape to copy or trace with a quick google search <p> Once you 're happy with the shape , cut it out ( both sides ) <p> Since the sides you have cut may have sharpie marks showing then make sure you glue this side up ! Make sure both pieces line up and apply a thin , clean line of glue around the edge . Carefully glue edge to edge in small stages 4/5ths of the way around <p> Do n't  forget to stop , you have to leave a hole for filling ! <p> When the glue is dry and you 're happy there 's no missed spots ie , holes , then turn it inside out .

It may still appear puckered in spots but you can iron those out ! <p> Start stuffing the pillow carefully , ensuring its totally filled ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it . Work out the bumps as you go . <p> The trickiest part is sealing the last gap since the fabric is now the right way around . Take your time and slowly glue it as neatly as possibly .

Its borderline psychic sometimes and that in itself can be unsettling . <p> I recently trudged through US Pre-clearance ( a wonderful affair where you clear immigration before entering the US ! ) in Dublin airport and one of the standard- questions I was asked had me thinking for a large portion of my 9 hour flight . <h> " Maam did you carry your own bag today ?

I carry burdens for people who do n't  seem to care about what they probably should care about . I carry burdens for friends and family suffering . I carry burdens for strangers I see on the news in sad or dangerous situations . So how do I prioritize my own ? <p> As someone extremely perceptive and introverted , I dislike nothing more than to be labelled too sensitive . Sensitivity is not a dirty concept . Sensitivity creates connection and intimacy . Sensitivity allows for compassion and understanding . Sensitivity is a wide open channel for love . It does n't  mean thin skin . It means deep strength but somewhere along the line we were all told its a pathetic sign of weakness . What I consider weak are those who run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and care for someone . Those who allow a loved one to carry their problems while they shamelessly continue on their carefree path . Weak are those who laugh in the face of sensitivity and take advantage of it . <p> Ive been through enough to want to give up a thousand times . Some days , I still want to but my empathy for others wont allow it . I guess empathy is stubborns over sensitive sister . <p> When something comes natural to you , its hard to deliberately stop doing it . For me , it is natural to worry for others and stress over things that are not mine to be concerned with . But who will worry for me ? Shouldnt I give myself the same courtesy I give to others and look out for myself ? Everyone desires to be supported .

By the time all my family help was gone and it was just me and her , things got better . That 's not to say that help wasnt productive or required it was . It was just coincidental that at that time my fog lifted and I found my feet as a mother . Since then we have been BFFs and I love every moment of Motherhood . <p> During my most difficult times in the early days the smallest things would have helped me a lot but I just was n't thinking clearly . You may read this list and think duh , that 's obvious and maybe so but to me it was n't . If this list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . <h> Diapers , Diapers Everywhere ! <p> If possible , have multiple changing areas . Or at least one downstairs as well as up . Stock up your changing stations BEFORE you have the baby ( I did not and had an actual meltdown having to set up diapers and wipes at 22.00 after arriving home from the hospital yes it was THAT late , do n't  ask ! ) <h> Zipideedooda ! <p> Avoid outfits with buttons . WHY do teeny tiny newborn outfits have real buttons , not even snaps , real life buttons ? ! So silly ! For the first few weeks try to find snap onesies or sleep suits with zips . <h> Dressing Down <p> Utilize the shoulder flaps on bodysuits . Most babies are not fans of pulling stuff over their heads . Plus you 're being mindful of the soft spots . Roll the onesie downward and even pull it up that way . Also , roll it down in the event of any poop-splosion ! <h> Stock-Take <p> The moment you come home from an outing with baby re-stock the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALWAYS make sure there 's a spare onesie , outfit and pair of socks replaced after use . And wipes , dear Lord do n't  forget to replace the wipes . What a horror show <h> Bib-ity , Bobity , Burp <p> Use bibs and keep burp cloths EVERYWHERE . Even while nursing , use bibs to catch spit-up and save the outfit . I do this not because I 'm so fussy that the outfit might get dirty but because it saves a ton of laundry and prevents those adorable little outfits from shrinking due to excessive washing . Unfortunately no bib or burp cloth can prevent what may or may not come out the other end <h> Puke Prevention <p> Change baby before feeding . Yes I know , I know baby may need a fresh diaper right after feeding but if he/she does n't  then you do n't  have to put them flat down and risk throwing it all back up . <p> New babies are hard work ! However , nothing can compare to the joy they bring . If you 're drowning in overwhelm do n't  be afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavailable then sit back and leave the dishes dirty and the floor unwashed . You can vacuum at any time in your life but baby will only be this tiny today . Its only a season ! <p> Did I ever mention how obsessed I am with succulents ? Maybe just a few times , like in this post and all the others . Move over pineapples , this years hot Summer motif is the cactus ! - As if the plants themselves werent adorable already- now I can not get enough of cactus themed everything . As obsessed as I am , all I have is a dish towel , a water bottle and a notebook . I think that shows some restraint . However , after doing my research for this post I think I 'm going to acquire a lot more . If you love them you 're welcome . If you hate them you 're still welcome ! I think you 'll win serious brownie points by gifting one of these to the succulover in your life . <p> This post contains Amazon affiliate links <h> Cactus Gifts For Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The- Girl Boss <h> The Moms <p> Yep , there goes my bank balance because I literally added everything on this list to my wishlist . Sigh <p> Remember that hospital bag checklist post I published before baby arrived ? here 's my update on how that stuff actually worked out for me . Clue : it did n't  . <p> At 37 weeks and 5 days pregnant I went in for one of my last routine prenatal check-ups only to find that baby was coming via c-section later that SAME day . Luckily I had tentatively packed my bags but there was still an element of surprise I was sure I 'd never experience . When you 're in shock like that , even adding the remaining 3 or 4 unpacked items can seem like a huge challenge . I mean , who is in the frame of mind right then to pack intelligently ? I was n't . Although I did curl my hair because , insanity <p> I arrived at the hospital three bags in tow . I left babys bag and my recovery bag in the car , bringing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need for waiting . Because waiting is never fun . In that bag I had my tablet , phone charger , camera and personal essentials like lip balm , hand cream , hair ties , clips etc . Mistake number one ! I did n't  need that bag . I was admitted at 3.45pm , gowned by 3.50pm and by 4.45 I was being prepped for surgery ! That bag turned into an inconvenience that had to be looked after at the nurses station and despite the fact that I was about to have major surgery and meet my baby , I was worrying about my belongings being safe . <p> Fast forward one hour . I was wheeled out of the OR , into a recovery unit where I spent another hour being prodded , poked and watched for surgical complications . Once I was sent to my room , I relaxed . I met my nurse , took my pain medication and settled into the worlds comfiest bed with baby in my arms . WE STAYED LIKE THIS FOR 2 DAYS . <p> I wore hospital gowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for skin-to-skin and feeding . Baby wore a diaper the entire time as she was skin-to-skin practically the whole stay . She was swaddled in hospital blankets and literally the ONLY thing she used that I brought was a hat ( the hospital also supplied me with 3 ) . In fact , the hospital supplied me with EVERYTHING . Diapers , wipes , blankets , hats , nasal aspirator , bath wash , wash cloths , hair brush , you name it it was there . I was so happy but also kicking myself for agonizing over the bag of goodies I had packed . Not to mention , baby was only 5lbs 11oz and to this day still hardly fits into anything I brought with me . I used nothing but deodorant and my toothbrush until I was going home when I got dressed for the first time ! The hospital provided me with all of my recovery essentials including random stuff like body wash , fluffy socks and other toiletries . <p> Long story short , I cant wait to have my second baby and rock up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well not literally but I will be going full minimalist ! <h> What I 'd Bring The Second Time Around <p> Boppy Pillow <p> Baby Going Home Outfit <p> Mom Going Home Outfit <p> 1 Muslin Swaddle Blanket <p> 1 Newborn Hat <p> Basic toiletries <p> Camera <p> I mean it , that 's it ! <p> What was your hospital stay like ? Were you given everything or left to fend for yourself ? <p> Long time , no post my friends ! Its been 8 joyful ( and exhausting ) weeks of being a mother and I was long overdue a new post . I planned on taking a month long blog break ( HA ! ) but evidently I overestimated my abilities to juggle it all . Motherhood has been the steepest learning curve of my life but I would n't change it for the world . My crafty side has been twitching from being so stagnant and today I 'm bringing you this adorable DIY name project . Put your own spin on it and add the sweetest personal touch to babys room ! <p> I love my babys name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long months agonizing over what it might be and hopefully she likes it just as much ! Im amazed by the amount of people who have n't heard the name before . In case you have n't heard of it , here 's a little background . <p> I always wanted to display the babys name in the nursery but was n't sure how . I 'm not a huge fan of letters hanging from the wall individually and since there are six of them in hers I was n't too wild about six permanent holes in my already terrible walls ! If you search baby name craft on Pinterest you will be able to scroll for hours through wood letter craft . Some of them were just too well , pinterest for me . I wanted something elegant and dainty yet without fuss . <p> To the craft store ! The best part of this was the fact that I bought everything I needed for under $15 ! I decided on scrapbook paper to decorate . Rather than sticking to one pattern I got four different kinds for a mismatched , feminine look . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew around the letters on my paper of choice , carefully cut out the shape ( using a sharp scissors ! ) then mod podged it to the wood . Done ! <p> Initially , I was going to display the letters simply . I purchased a narrow frame shelf on Amazon with the intention of propping them up against the wall but I ( horribly ) misjudged the length of the name and size of the shelf and so that was nixed . The shelf now displays some of her prettiest books in what turned into a happy accident ! In the end I chose to arrange the letters in a fun design and glue them together before hanging the name as one piece . I absolutely love how it turned out ! <h> Did you do any nursery craft ? Feel free to share in the comment section = <p> Since I have had the ability to read , I have been a bookworm . While reading seems to be a love it or hate it pastime , it is a pastime I can not imagine living without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to escape the banal , live other lives and learn without limitation . There are many things I want for my daughter , one of which is to instill the same love of reading that her Dad and I have . To see Isolde enjoying books will make my heart so happy . In fact , some of the first things I bought for babys room , while pregnant , were books ! <p> This post is in partnership with I See Me- Books . I received this book free of charge in exchange for my honest review . <h> How To Nurture A Baby Bookworm <h> Read bedtime stories <p> Reading to newborns has been linked to early speech development , wider vocabularies and better listening and communication skills . Aside from setting your child up for these benefits , some quiet story time with baby can be a lovely bonding experience . <h> Create a cozy reading nook <p> There 's something satisfying about having your own quiet space to curl up with your book , young kids like this just as much ! <h> Visit the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book each time but make visiting the book store a fun treat . Is there anything more exciting than a child asking to check out the new releases ? ! <h> Join your local library <p> Books can be expensive . Especially new releases ! Visit the library and choose from thousands of titles for free or a nominal annual membership fee . Usually the childrens section also offers fun arts and crafts activities and story telling events . <h> Start a seasonal book buying tradition <p> Whether they are new titles or pre-loved , start a tradition of acquiring a book for each season/event . St. Patricks Day , Easter , - Independence Day , Christmas etc . Its a great way to learn about the origins of the holidays while still having fun . Growing up I would also get a new book before vacations or as a gift on vacation . <h> Read a book about them ! <p> Isolde at just 4 weeks old , was lucky enough to be gifted with another book to add to her rapidly growing collection . This book though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from I See Me which is all about her . I adore it and I hope she will too . There is something so special about customized books in which the individual child is the protagonist of the story . <p> Since I met her Dad , we have traveled all over Europe and the United States and so the book Its Fancy To Be Me was the perfect choice . In the book , Isolde travels around the world experiencing the traditional dress and unique cultures of the places she visits . It is the sweetest story with gorgeous illustrations ! <p> The best part of the book is that the illustrations can be customized to have your childs hair/eye/skin color making for total customization . As well as this , her full name and date of birth is included in the first page along with a dedication of your choosing . <p> I am already planning my next purchase from I See Me for both Isolde and gifts for others . I was impressed with the quality and the book was delivered within one week . As well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch boxes and growth charts . If Isolde is anything like me she will be a puzzle master = <p> Baby arrived unexpectedly three days prior to posting but more on that later ! * <p> It is almost baby time , people ! I cant believe it , we are just days ( hopefully not weeks ! ) away from meeting baby ! On that note , I 'll be taking a month off from blogging to learn how to mom but will be active on social media and hopefully reappear here some time in May . As I reflect on my pregnancy I wanted to share with you some of my maternity photos . Over Presidents Day weekend we took a trip to Charleston where I had a surprise babymoon/maternity photo shoot thanks to my husband ! From the start , I had always wanted to do maternity photos but it was one of those things I kept putting off for a multitude of reasons . <p> We drove the short two hour drive to Charleston that Friday . I immediately kicked myself for spending two years living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sophistication . It is the gastronomic capital of the South and has all the fun of the seaside just a stones throw away . It really is the perfect city for everyone whether you want a family vacation , romantic getaway or girls weekend ! <p> Our first stop before the city was Folly Beach , a popular vacation spot just outside Charleston . We met the lovely Melissa of Oakley Photography and had a 2 hour session with her . My maternity shoot was my first ever photo shoot besides my wedding photos . I was so hesitant to have maternity photos taken because I feel a constant state of awkwardness ! Well none of that mattered . Melissa is down to earth , funny and manages to make you feel so at ease . She knows exactly what shes doing and has a great eye for flattering shots . I couldnt be happier with my photos , its been a while since I felt that pretty and she made it happen effortlessly . <p> There 's something pretty powerful about growing a little person inside you and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether its your first baby or your fifth , newborns come with overwhelmingly long to-do lists ! When you are entirely preoccupied with everything you must do to prepare for babys arrival , its easy to forget the monotonous things that still need tending to in our day to day lives . Who wants to have a newborn baby , be overwhelmed by motherhood and realize you have to go to the store for toilet paper ? Not this gal ! With just a couple of weeks left before babys arrival , I 'm sharing with you a list of things to get done that you will either have no time nor desire to do once baby arrives . <h> Your Hair ! <p> This one is n't the most important , I admit , but you deserve some pampering mama ! Its not easy waddling around feeling super uncomfortable 24/7 . Get your hair done and relish your glamorous locks before they 're full of spit up on the regular . Not to mention , finding 2-3 hours for a hair appointment wont be an option very soon ! <p> Another good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you know that women are far more susceptible to dental problems during pregnancy ? Now is the time for a check-up or even just a clean . Who knows when you might get time to go again . <h> Make Lists <p> This is the crazy organized part of me shining through . I have compiled a list of family and friends numbers who we want to share the news of babys arrival with immediately . This helps to avoid forgetting someone when you 're running on endorphins and wont exactly be thinking of Uncle so and so who then gets super offended that he saw it on facebook . So make a list or yknow , tell everyone online and offend them all equally . Whatever your view is , its your baby ! <p> A perhaps more achievable list to compile is a list of recipients for your Thank You cards as you receive registry gifts . I did n't  have a baby shower but we were still flooded with gifts from family and friends . For the love of God do n't  fail to thank those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  do it as they arrive , be sure to send a birth announcement card with a thank you from baby attached . <h> Deep Clean <p> And by deep clean , I mean have your ever-so-gracious and helpful partner do it or hire someone . Do n't  attempt all that bending and scrubbing alone . Have rooms/closets organized , carpets shampooed , windows cleaned and basically any big Spring cleaning kind of task that more than likely will not get done with a newborn around . <p> Since January we have been taking a room or area of the house each week in which to deep clean blinds , window screen ledges , windows and baseboards . My husband has shampooed the carpets and we maintain a twice weekly quick and general cleaning of the whole house to keep it up . <h> Stockpile Household Necessities <p> 2 days postpartum is not the time to find out you have run out of bin liners , toilet paper , disinfectant etc . Have everything stocked up that you use week to week . Its not like bathroom cleaning spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . <p> I went to my local Sams Club and stocked up on TP , paper towels , trash bags , body wash , razor blades , toothpaste , pantry staples such as cereals , pasta , grains , sauces &amp; seasonings and also , a large freezer meat supply ! Im subscribed to diapers and other baby essentials on Amazon Prime so I can rest assured that will be taken care of . Basically all I will need weekly is fresh produce and dairy which my husband can help out with by quickly picking up on the way home from work . <h> Prepare The Car ( + Install Car Seat ) <p> Keep your vehicle pet hair free when babys due date is getting close ! We have an SUV that will be perfect for carting around babys gear but up until now its been the personal Uber car for our Labradoodle . Let 's just say he got WAY more lab than poodle and he sheds like a maniac every February or if he s just been bathed . Weve vacuumed out the car and installed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the baby . Ew . Poor Darby is now limited to riding in less style in my husbands commute-to-work car . But he does n't  mind once he ends up at the park , the beach or his friend Olafs house ! <h> Prepare Freezer or Crockpot-Ready Meals <p> This one takes effort but oh goodness will it be worth it when you 're so tired you could crumple in a heap and cry ! I 'm a big supporter of the crockpot . That glorious device that I dump stuff into and can magically eat 8 hours later . Set aside an evening to plan your meals . Then spend a morning shopping for ingredients and the rest of the day assembling . Again , request help with this one . This is definitely a task where many hands make light work . Stock up on freezer bags and get to it . Itll be so satisfying to see your meals for a solid month or more all taken of ! You will be less tempted to order fast food . This is not only costly but not the healthiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Bonus + Often Overlooked Task ! <h> Make Arrangements for Pet Care <p> This gives me the most anxiety . Babies are n't  exactly known for their perfect , convenient arrival times on their exact due date . Were lucky to have the worlds best puppy sitter ! Shes flexible and ever so good to the Dood . Ensure you have someone lined up to take care of your pet . Decide whether they will take them to their place or stay at yours . These plans will be loose until the big day . Most people are understanding about the unknowns in this situation . <p> Surviving St. Patricks Day in Ireland is one thing . Surviving it in America when you 're Irish , is another ! Put on your best smile and your pointiest elbows and be prepared for an obnoxiously green , semi-racially offensive grand ol time ! I kid of course . Kind of . <p> On March 17th , the whole world seems to honor the Irish famous landmarks go green , parades are held and guinness flows more freely than usual . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't meet one American on St. Patricks Day whose Dads cousins husbands sisters mail man was Irish and therefore so are they . <h> Surviving St. Patricks Day in America <h> I-rish I Were IRISH <p> My husband always has a new anecdote for me and it cracks me up ! Now and again at his workplace my nationality will come up and the response has more than once been , " Oh really ? I 'm Irish too ! Where is she from ? ! " Now this would be a perfectly acceptable question if they were asking from which county or town . Alas , multiple people have now asked WHAT STATE I am from . Heres what 's wrong , Americans now claim Irish heritage so haphazardly that being Irish no longer means from the country . Its just a generic label and it can simply mean , Ohio . I 'm currently working my way through all fifty States in response . <h> BEGORRAH , BEGOSH , TOP O THE MORNIN <p> and all those other words and phrases that Irish people quite literally never say . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been exposed . My personal tip for dealing with this is the Carlsberg response of " ci+nas , bothar , cail+n , bainne " . Irish people will know that in our native tongue this means nothing more than " silence , road , girl , milk " a collection of random words . Youve got to give the people what they want ! Tell them it means " you 've never met a nicer person " and be on your merry way . <h> DRUNKEN TOMFOOLERY <p> It sounds like a guys name ( and NO I do n't  know him because he s Irish ) but in fact its the theme of the day . This is the more offensive aspect of the day for me . A lot of people in the US and beyond view drunken debauchery as the ONLY mark of a true Irishman . Mimic my accent and use stereotypical Irish-isms its fine . I do n't  take it personally because frankly I know a lot of these people genuinely like Ireland , the culture and the accent . They mean no real harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk related quip then I 'm going to get real mad , real fast ! Sometimes I like a drink . Sometimes I do n't  like a drink . Contrary to popular belief , holding an Irish passport does n't  mean I binge drink regularly and have Jameson flowing through my veins . <p> Again through my dear husband this wretched stereotype has reached me again and again . Sometimes directly to my face . Its taken me a while but I 've managed to perfect a smile that is much less psychotic than my first few attempts.If you 're familiar with The Big Bang Theory its like Sheldons smile . <p> There I am among a group of people ( all enjoying a quiet drink ) and my friend is asked what she 's drinking , she replies with the name of her cocktail and then Im asked by the same person . I tell this person what 's in my glass and the response is " of course you 're drinking , you 're Irish " . Now should I be mad at that comment or that my friend seemed to be able to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will stress again that I do n't  really take this one too personally but I DO feel awfully self-conscious every time I take a sip of my drink after such a comment . <p> I will leave my feelings on a certain drink called the Irish Car Bomb " completely out of this post ! <p> If you 're looking for something to remind you of Ireland please let it be beautiful scenery , ancient history or scholarly achievements , not excessive alcohol consumption ! <h> GREEN <p> All shades of it and all at once . If its green theyll be wearing it , eating it and drinking it . <p> Last year I attended the parade in Downtown Savannah , the second largest St. Patricks Day parade in the world . That epic thing was almost 4 hours long . It was a sight to behold and probably my best St. Patricks Day ever ! I have never seen so much GREEN ! I probably should n't tell you that practically nobody in Ireland with the exception of small kids will wear green on March 17th ! But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep it clean people , weve already established the penchant for assuming were a nation of drunks but at kid friendly parades its probably best to keep your explicit t-shirts in the closet at home ! <h> PATTY , THE FORGOTTEN SISTER OF PATRICK <p> At least , that must be who she is because no Irishman is called Patty . Patty is short for Patricia , Paddy is short for Patrick . Those are the rules . " But there 's no T , it makes no sense ! " I hear you cry ! The name Patrick is Padraig ( Paw-drig ) in Irish , hence the Paddy . <p> Men called Patrick may be known as Pa , Pat , Paddy , Pod , Pawd , Pauric , Padraig the list goes on . But never Patty . I repeat NEVER PATTY ! <p> This sign was posted by Dublin Airport last year and I think its hilarious ! <p> " Please share this simple message with your friends and relations in the United States and Canada . Using the power of your network , hopefully we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Dublin Airport " <p> Every time you utter the phrase , St. Pattys Day a tiny leprechaun dies . True Story . You do n't  want that on you , do you ? ! <p> Keep it real , protect the leprechauns . They 're dying out like the Irish language . <h> PINCH THIS <p> I do n't  know where the heck that came from but I 'm sensing its an American invention since as I said , Irish people do n't  generally take part in greening their attire . The story goes if you do n't  wear green , you 'll be pinched as a reminder that leprechauns will pinch you for the same reason . Fortunately , youve all said Patty so much the leprechauns have suffered a massive decrease in population and wont be around to cause any pinch pains . <h> SHAMROCK NOT- FOUR LEAFED CLOVER <p> Shamrock was used to symbolize Christianity in Ireland and is an unofficial national symbol . Its not to be confused with the Harp which is our official national emblem and also not to be confused with a four leafed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four leafed version is said to be lucky because its harder to find. - The three leaves of the shamrock were used to symbolize the Holy Trinity by St. Patrick . On March 17th , people typically pin a small bunch of shamrock on their lapel or hat . Some do n't  know the meaning of small . <p> All jokes aside , America made St. Patricks Day what it is today and like anything they do , they attack it with gusto ! We all must grit our teeth- and roll our eyes deep within our brains from time to time but there 's little I would change ( except Patty stop that ! ) about Irish America and the festivities of St. Patricks Day here . The relationship between our nations throughout history has been strong and continues to be . No matter where I go in the US , people have nothing but positive words and funny stories to tell about their travels to my homeland . <p> Since I ca n't be in Ireland , America is the only other place I 'd rather be ! <p> Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have passed since my last update , it feels like I just blinked and February was suddenly over . I 'm officially in the 9th month of my pregnancy and it could very well even be baby month ! Its a little bittersweet . Although I have been through the general worries that come with pregnancy , I have enjoyed this time and made a conscious effort to soak up the entire experience . I have had it pretty easy , medically , and honestly have n't yet thought I am so sick of being pregnant ! . I think I 'm going to be of those annoying women who whines about missing their bump ! <p> This post may contain affiliate links <p> Something I did struggle with and still do in my pregnancy is some emotional issues that go beyond raging hormones . Needless to say , depression and stress are not good for baby . Today , as well as a quick pregnancy update I want to share with you some of my absolute self care lifesavers in these final weeks . Now , more than ever , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that baby pack on the pounds ! Its also your final time just being you . Alone . Kind of scary , huh ? A little guilt free indulgence is just what the doctor ordered ! <h> Boppy Pregnancy Wedge <p> I bought this rather late , probably around week 28 but it has been so good for supporting the bump and my back both in bed and while sitting on the couch . <h> Essential Oil Diffuser <p> Give me all of the calming lavender oil ! I love my diffuser and its really fun to create new blends . I 'm not an essential oil expert by any means but its an interesting new world to me ! Just make sure the oils you are using are n't  harmful to your pregnancy . <h> Back Support <p> I admit I do n't  use this daily but if I have some chores to do or anything that involves standing for a little longer than I 'm used to this is a life saver ! It takes the pressure off my abdomen and also my lower back . There are far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this but for my needs its perfect . <h> Glam Glow Super-Mud Clearing Treatment <p> This ones for sure an indulgence ! I have problematic skin since I was 13 years old and pregnancy has wreaked even more havoc . This is the only glow in my third trimester . I 'm pretty certain while the mask is on I can almost feel the gunk being sucked out of my pores . Gross but satisfying . I 'm not usually one for cult beauty products but for me , this really works . <h> Compression Socks <p> As well as long road trips , I did some international travel during my second trimester so compression socks were a must for my circulation during my flights . If you 're on your feet all day , I highly suggest donning a pair of these . They are also recommended during c-section recovery if that happens to be on the cards for you . <h> Measured Water Bottle <p> After becoming dehydrated a few times I got very serious about my water intake . It is so important for baby . I drink three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thanks to the marked measurements . I drink a certain amount by a certain time of day and by 8pm I 'm confident I have satisfied my water intake ! <h> Body Pillow <p> From the start a body pillow seemed like a pointless expense . Enter the third trimester ! YOU . NEED . THIS . Sleep is fleeting or non existent . Do everything you possibly can to get some . <h> Burts Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter <p> I used this from day one . I 'm sure its more down to my body type and the fact that I 'm very slight but so far I have no stretch marks . I apply this to my belly and chest after a shower and again before bed . It does n't  react in any negative way and leaves my skin feeling so soft ! <h> 36 Weeks Pregnancy Update <p> According to the app , at 36 weeks baby is the size of a honeydew melon ! Baby weighs close to 6 lbs and is around 18.5 inches long . <p> Total weight gain <p> 24 lbs <p> Maternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans are my BFF on weekends as well as soft jersey midi dresses ! <p> Stretch marks <p> None and happy to get to 36 weeks without any but I wo n't mind too much if I still do . <p> Sleep <p> I 'm really struggling to fall asleep these past few weeks . Sticking to sleeping on my left side makes my face numb and kills my neck ! I still do ok once I actually fall asleep but getting there is so difficult . Its often well past 2am before I get to sleep . I feel exhausted all the time but trying not to nap as it makes falling asleep even more difficult . <p> Longing for <p> All the sweets , soft drinks and caffeine in the world . I guess cravings only hit me in the third trimester ! I 'm doing well with not giving in to every craving . Sodas are not consumed , coffee is only allowed once a week and sweets are kept to a minimum ! <p> Movement <p> Baby is pretty cramped in there now so feeling jabby little stretches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been feeling . It seems the baby has the hiccups often though which is a rather strange sensation . Sometimes it continues for ages . <p> Out as much as it will be . Still doing its weird half and half thing and still freaking me out . <p> Wedding rings on or off ? <p> On and still wrestling to take to them off , especially in our warm Georgia Spring weather . <p> Happy or moody ? <p> Anxious , which more often than not leads to moodiness over happiness ! <p> Looking forward to <p> Installing the car seat , placing my bags by the door and setting up some baby gear around the house . Its suddenly very real . It will feel even more real when my family visits later in the month .

This year , after an extremely emotionally demanding 2016 , my main goal is self improvement . This resolution was borne out of necessity . With my first baby arriving soon there is simply no choice to continue in the mental state I was in . Stress is not good for your growing baby so it is incredibly important to ensure you have a safe , stress-free and happy pregnancy . Taking time for yourself is easier said than done but if I could prevent even one person from feeling the strain I have felt then I would be content . <p> Whether your stress is a direct result of work , relationship issues , financial problems etc. it does not matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be detrimental to their mental health in years to come . Even at this point I feel a large amount of guilt for inflicting my sadness and worries onto my baby . Clawing your way out of a rut is n't easy and casting aside fears is less so . With every kick and hiccup from inside I am reminded and determined to be the best version of myself . Both for the baby and for my own happiness . Sometimes you will come to realize that your expectations of support are nothing more than expectation and in that situation you must be everything you need by yourself . <h> " So what can I do to minimize stress ? " <p> First of all , like any issue , recognize that you need help and be able to admit it . Even if only to yourself . Fortunately with self care , YOU can help you . All it takes is remembering be to intentional . <p> Self care practices range from the tiniest trivial activity to life altering decisions and you get to choose what is best for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put , do more of the things you love , the things that make you feel warm and fuzzy inside . If that means taking a vacation or just putting on freshly laundered pjs then do it and do it solely for you . <p> As a highly sensitive and introverted person , time outs are a necessity for me . Unfortunately time away from the chaos does n't  simply equate to positive , revitalizing me-time . I can often spend it in turmoil with a very messy , over analytical mindset . This serves me no purpose and adds to my woes . For self care to be legitimate and genuinely help you , you must be intentionally selfish and make it entirely about you . <p> These activities are so easy but we often ignore them . Sometimes we just need a little nudge ! What are some of your favorite self care practices ? <p> Yes those last few on your list were my go-tos when I was pregnant . I was HUGE so things like pedicures were super important because I could not reach my feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to get my hair done , and she was right- just a simple wash and blow out by a professional does n't  cost a fortune and makes you feel so much better ! Good luck to you Amy , I am glad you 're taking good care of yourself . <p> I so agree with your advice to do whatever is best for you . During my second pregnancy I had a lot of hip pain , and I let others expectations of me lead me to do more than I should . When you 're responsible for another life , you need to do what 's best for you and Baby ! <p> I love that you included a list of ideas for self-care ! They all sound lovely . My favorite one is writing letters to your baby . I wish I would have thought of that ! Maybe next time = <p> Girl , I 'm not even pregnant , but these self care tips are perfect .

Self care during your pregnancy can definitely set the stage for once you have your baby as well . I had to learn that the hard way , as I did n't  take good enough care of myself during my pregnancy . It was a hard transition when I had my baby ! I encourage you to educate yourself on postpartum blues , depression , and anxiety . It is so common and happens to 1 out of every 5 women . Congratulations on the baby ! <p> Definitely something that comes into my mind when I 'm feeling down during . I would hate to be debilitated emotionally once the baby arrives and trying to educate myself on PPD and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draining mentally and physically with a newborn . Thank you for the comment ! <p> I LOVE this ! = With my second pregnancy , I felt so much more aware of my baby and what my body was doing . Self-care is vital for my mental/emotional well-being during pregnancy as well as motherhood in general ! <p> I love this so much ! We have forgotten as a society how to slow down and take care of ourselves and how to help support pregnant and post partum mamas who need more rest , time off of their feet , and more nourishment than they 're getting . Thanks for sharing this and stressing how important self care is . <p> Such a beautiful post with great information . I stumbled on it and decided to read it since my sister is now pregs . I will be forwarding it to her , however , found some great tips for me too . I too am introverted and in stressful situations can be sensitive .

@@48796257 @2296257/ <p> Spring has sprung and so has my baby bump ! At 34 weeks pregnant , I am feeling lethargic , anxious and less than attractive . One sure fire way to improve my mood when I 'm feeling down is to dress myself up . Dressing up while eight months pregnant however , is no easy task . You are more than likely bored stiff of wearing whatever still fits you . Cue Pink Blush and their vast selection of gorgeous maternity dresses . <p> This post was in partnership with Pink Blush . As always , all opinions are my own . <p> I wanted something feminine and comfortable to serve me throughout the rest of my pregnancy in a warm Georgia Spring . I was also keen to find something that could be worn postpartum for easy nursing . None of us are the perfect size and shape but I find it especially hard to shop for dresses to suit my frame as I am 6 feet tall . Short dresses on me could be deemed a criminal offense and typically , maxi dresses sit somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , finding the perfect midi dress is like hitting the jackpot . <p> To flatter the bump and to suit babys nursing needs , I chose this hi-lo style midi number . Nothing says Goodbye , Winter ! like a pretty floral print and a little big of leg ! I instantly fell in love with the dress that ticked all the boxes . This dress not only showcases the bump adorably but also hides a multitude of sins and is SO comfortable . That equates to the trifecta of cute maternity clothes in case you did n't  know ! <p> I noticed the companys tagline is Effortless styles for the modern mother and theyve certainly got it right . Pregnancy clothes are typically NOT cute , let 's be honest ! If you 're searching for gorgeous , on-trend maternity wear , then I suggest taking a look at Pink Blush . You 'll find not only maternity wear but regular sizes , plus sizes , shoes and accessories too . <p> Initially , the thoughts of a maternity wardrobe horrified me which is strange because I love fashion , shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need bigger clothes . Or the effort of shopping for them but simply the fact that if you stick the word maternity in front of any item of clothing it seems to triple in price . The sting in that is the amount of time you will actually spend wearing these pieces . It is so short ! So in my pregnancy ignorance I assumed I would get away with leggings and my loose tunic style tops for the next few months . Yeah , I quickly learned that is n't going to happen . My bump is still teeny tiny but I am rocking the maternity jeans a good few weeks now . Undershirts have become weird belly tops and button down tops no longer button . <p> With that , I have started to pick up a few key pieces that are versatile enough to build different outfits around . Think essential basics like leggings , tanks , long tees , tunics , casual jersey dresses and layering items like shirts , cardigans and blanket scarves . <p> Luckily I will be spending my pregnancy sporting Winter gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Georgia Summer , ick . However , Winter really only arrives here in January so there is no need for heavy coats and huge sweaters . With upcoming trips to Ireland and Huntsville , I will need some cold weather attire occasionally but I hope to pull this off by layering basics with chunky cardigans already in my wardrobe ! <p> Comfort is the winner for me with style taking a close second . Here are some of my suggested essentials to get you through your Fall/Winter pregnancy in total comfort and the height of style = <h> BASIC TOPS <p> I would suggest buying these in white , grey and black or multiples of whichever your favorite color is ! These are perfect for layering . Wear under sweaters , kimonos , cardigans , blazer etc . I love the longer length to cover the waistband of my jeans/leggings . If you are still doing the hair-tie trick with your pants , they are perfect for hiding that too ! <h> SWEATERS &amp; LAYERING <p> None of these are maternity pieces which I love because you 'll wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airy and look great over leggings for a relaxed but dressed up look . I LOVE this plaid kimono , get your Autumn plaid shirt fix without battling buttons . Chunky knitwear is a no brainer when it comes to layers so it needs no explanation . How cute is this layered sweater ? Its also peplum which means you can wear it without the bump stretching it out ! Win ! <h> BOTTOMS <p> Maternity jeans and a pair of comfy leggings ( or 5 ! ) will be absolutely lived in throughout your entire pregnancy . I was lucky enough to get a 40% off any single item code for H&amp;M which allowed me to pick up these jeans for a steal . Overalls/dungarees are a love or hate maternity piece but I adore this skinny legged pair ! <h> DRESSES <p> If dresses are your style then they will be your splurge item . However if you find a casual dress that can take you from day to night then it will be an worthwhile investment ! Add a wide brim hat and chunky statement jewelry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress #4 with denim leggings and over the knee boots as I do n't  like bare legs with knit dresses but to each their own . <h> Check out my Bump Style Pinterest board for ways to wear similar styles <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358 
@@48796258 @2296258/ <p> Ah , the comfort zone . That safe place where the only feelings you feel are warm and fuzzy . If you suddenly find yourself married to a service member you will know that your comfort zone is all but a distant memory . A place , that once in your life was a certainty until you became a military spouse . <p> I grew up in Ireland , totally ignorant to the culture that comes with a large scale military . When I met my husband , I saw him as any other normal guy but it did n't  take me long to realize that as well as the cultural differences associated with our places of birth I was also dunked without warning into the vastly complicated world of the US Army and earned the title military spouse . <h> The Most Overwhelming Aspects Of Military Life For The New Military Spouse <h> Equipment <p> Your childhood garage once housed tools and bicycles but yours now contains tough boxes and over-flowing rucksacks stacked to the ceiling . <p> His closet is filled with dress uniforms , covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy boots . Then he comes home and announces that there 's a new uniform coming out . Enter more of the above and expect to find the old stuff crammed into every spare space in your home/garage . <p> There 's a box somewhere that should be full of name tapes , patches , awards and the ruler to make sure his dress uniform meets regulation . That darn ruler is always missing . <h> Terminology <p> Hell text you to say that he " has to do a brief at the Motor Pool with the CSM at sixteen hundred " . WHAT ? Or life changing conversations like " After he attends CCC you will PCS to Fort X to take command " . Again , WHAT ? <p> I mustve been with my husband for four years when I still found myself asking him what he even does all day . ( I have since found out , sort of ! ) <p> The terminology is difficult to get used to but I assure you , you will learn . Have patience ( both of you ! ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acronyms , rank and general structure of the military . There 's an awful lot but its not to difficult to understand . See it as an opportunity to learn a new language of sorts . <h> Rank <p> This one comes back to the structure . There 's a basic split : Enlisted and Officers and within each of them are many different ranks . Learn about the ranks and their symbols here . Like with anything in the Army there are certain rules attached with who can be associated with who , socially . Fortunately for spouses there is no rank ! <h> Etiquette <p> Whether its stopping what you are doing ( to include driving ) to face the flag at retreat , walking on his left side while in uniform to allow him to salute if needed or not wearing a piece of his uniform all military spouses should be familiar with the dos and donts of military etiquette . <h> Deployments <p> The word all military families fear most , deployment . Anywhere from a few months to a year , your spouse could be deployed oversees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . He could miss birthdays , holidays and even the birth of babies . Unfortunately its a real and present part of being an active-duty service member . Read about our long distance story , here . There are many resources online that serve as guides and support for coping with deployment . I personally like Jo , My Gosh ! blog . <h> Secrets <p> We all know that the key to a good marriage is honesty and communication . Unfortunately in the military , your significant other may not be able to share everything about his job with you . This can be frustrating . Do n't  take it personally he probably feels immense pressure just from not being able to tell you . <h> Sacrifices <p> He makes many just by choosing a career in the military but boy , oh , boy will you make sacrifices ! You first give up your home and family to be by your S/Os side and more often than not you will also give up your own career in order to move around . Of course it is n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . Many military spouses own their own portable businesses and many are homemakers and home schoolers . The list and opportunities are endless . It is entirely up to you . For someone like me with a mechanical engineering degree , it is difficult to manage a full-time career when your location is so disposable . Were all just figuring it out ! <h> Making Plans <p> To put abruptly you do n't  ! Plans are for missions . Your home life however , tends to be up in the air until the last minute . Military life changes as quickly as the Irish weather ! Learning to be a little more spontaneous will do wonders for your sanity . <h> Difficult People <p> Difficult people are everywhere . Not just in military communities . There are certain stereotypes associated with military spouses . Some more derogatory than others . Gossip and drama persists at a rampant pace . Toxic people do n't  belong in your life . Steer clear of people who exist only to make others lives miserable . This is not a community in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among military spouses and contrary to some stories you might hear , you will make some of the best friends you will ever meet on your military journey . <h> Realizing How Strong You Are <p> I do n't  give myself enough credit for how strong I am in this whirlwind life . Nor do other friends I know . It is probably because half the time you are on the verge of tears , biting your lip to stop from FREAKING OUT about the latest piece of information he has brought home . Its hard to feel strong when you 're drained inside from wondering how you 'll cope the next time he leaves . But when he does , you surprise yourself with how much of a bad a** you are ! <p> The best and most frightening thing to comprehend is that being forced out of your comfort zone makes you realize what a resilient and resourceful , strong person you truly are ! <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358

It takes the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are far more expensive ( and probably much higher quality ) ones than this but for my needs its perfect . <h> Glam Glow Super-Mud Clearing Treatment <p> This ones for sure an indulgence ! I have problematic skin since I was 13 years old and pregnancy has wreaked even more havoc . This is the only glow in my third trimester . I 'm pretty certain while the mask is on I can almost feel the gunk being sucked out of my pores . Gross but satisfying . I 'm not usually one for cult beauty products but for me , this really works . <h> Compression Socks <p> As well as long road trips , I did some international travel during my second trimester so compression socks were a must for my circulation during my flights . If you 're on your feet all day , I highly suggest donning a pair of these . They are also recommended during c-section recovery if that happens to be on the cards for you . <h> Measured Water Bottle <p> After becoming dehydrated a few times I got very serious about my water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink three of these per day and the reason I can do that is thanks to the marked measurements . I drink a certain amount by a certain time of day and by 8pm I 'm confident I have satisfied my water intake ! <h> Body Pillow <p> From the start a body pillow seemed like a pointless expense . Enter the third trimester ! YOU . NEED . THIS . Sleep is fleeting or non existent . Do everything you possibly can to get some . <h> Burts Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter <p> I used this from day one . I 'm sure its more down to my body type and the fact that I 'm very slight but so far I have no stretch marks . I apply this to my belly and chest after a shower and again before bed .

Sticking to sleeping on my left side makes my face numb and kills my neck ! I still do ok once I actually fall asleep but getting there is so difficult .

Not because I received negativity but because I received support . I am aware that seems incredibly cynical and negative . I was finally able to share the pregnancy journey with those who seemed concerned , interested and happy for me .

Its borderline psychic sometimes and that in itself can be unsettling . <p> I recently trudged through US Pre-clearance ( a wonderful affair where you clear immigration before entering the US ! ) in Dublin airport and one of the standard- questions I was asked had me thinking for a large portion of my 9 hour flight . <h> " Maam did you carry your own bag today ? " <p> I did carry my bag , of course . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrosity I had just lugged through check in . In the past five years I 've carried my fair share of heavy bags and I 'm now aware that I have carried them mentally too which led me to think about how much weight on my shoulders could I drop off and not worry about ? <p> Being empathetic involves a lot of worry and 80% of it never seems to be my own . I carry burdens for people who do n't  seem to care about what they probably should care about . I carry burdens for friends and family suffering . I carry burdens for strangers I see on the news in sad or dangerous situations . So how do I prioritize my own ? <p> As someone extremely perceptive and introverted , I dislike nothing more than to be labelled too sensitive . Sensitivity is not a dirty concept . Sensitivity creates connection and intimacy . Sensitivity allows for compassion and understanding . Sensitivity is a wide open channel for love . It does n't  mean thin skin . It means deep strength but somewhere along the line we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I consider weak are those who run from problems . Those who abandon instead of stand up and care for someone . Those who allow a loved one to carry their problems while they shamelessly continue on their carefree path . Weak are those who laugh in the face of sensitivity and take advantage of it . <p> Ive been through enough to want to give up a thousand times . Some days , I still want to but my empathy for others wont allow it . I guess empathy is stubborns over sensitive sister . <p> When something comes natural to you , its hard to deliberately stop doing it . For me , it is natural to worry for others and stress over things that are not mine to be concerned with . But who will worry for me ? Shouldnt I give myself the same courtesy I give to others and look out for myself ? Everyone desires to be supported . There 's great confidence in being enveloped by unconditional support but its not always an option . Sometimes you have to be enough by yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the weight of others baggage to she 'd that load and prioritize yourself . Especially if what you are carrying goes entirely unrecognized . For your health and your happiness , lay down the baggage and carry yourself . <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358

It is rather overwhelming looking around your home and realizing just how much you need to buy for baby . I think the worst kind of baby gear is the stuff that lasts five minutes and is then no longer of any use . Like a bassinet or a changing table . <p> I was lucky to have an old TV cabinet sitting in my garage that had the perfect potential for a changing unit . This was achieved by simply changing the color ! I was able to create a beautiful piece of furniture for the nursery that can be used as both a changing table and later , a storage unit . What I love about re-purposing a small cabinet is the versatility of the end result . You could remove the doors and add decorative storage boxes to make it more gender/theme specific or you can also choose to- keep the doors and hide boring necessities behind them . <p> I am doing the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby changing station ! The upper shelf which is usually for DVD players , game consoles and the like will be a place to store basics like onesies/bibs/burp cloths and the inevitable spare outfits we will need with some changes ! Behind the doors there is one shelf which will be home to endless diapers , wipes and also health and bath products . All I am really adding to this piece is a standard changing pad . <p> For such a huge transformation and total re-purpose , this project is the easiest I have ever done . It had two steps . <p> I have two words people . CHALK . PAINT . <p> Paint that magic potion directly onto your dust-free , un-sanded wood and watch it transform ! Granted , it took four or five coats but if you are not in a rush and have patience then you can get away without prepping . I underestimated how many coats it would need and I went through two tubs before I gave in and bought a bigger one to finish it . If in doubt , buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sand and fully prep the furniture from the start . The reason I did n't  was because I began during Summer and therefore in the height of my allergy season . It just was n't worth the agony in my eyes and the sneezing fits ! Once you are happy with the coverage you can use a clear wax to seal and protect it . <p> I 'm SO happy with the way this unit turned out and even happier that I have a piece of nursery furniture that cost me $25 !

I started blogging over 8 months ago and consistency was my initial goal . While consistency is important it does n't  necessarily mean lots of posts - a big mistake I was making . I would post on Monday , Wednesday and Friday consistently for months . I was drained . Although my stats and follow count were growing , my plate was full and my brain was empty . I was drained . I had more writers block than interest in my blog . What good were all my readers when I was churning out sub-par content ? They would get bored and leave anyway . <p> As well as poor content , by posting three times a week my posts had a shelf life of just one day . One day to promote my blog meant joining every group thread that was applicable . While it is fine to join them all , it is easy to forget that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own social media platforms , building community AND preparing new content every day was exhausting . This is all in addition to my normal day to day life . Talk about burn out . <p> It became somewhat manageable . And by manageable I mean I was stressed , irritable and ignoring my own needs physically and mentally . When it really became too much is when we had travel plans or social engagements and I would be forced to take a break . Note I said forced because that 's how the self-inflicted pressure made me feel . I would return home to masses of threads to complete , comments to answer and social media to engage with . I needed to manage the blog entirely differently . It was literally taking the reigns of my entire life . <h> I decided to give myself the gift of time <p> I dropped Fridays post .

After weeks of scheduling , the well had run dry and with family events and vacations planned I was under pressure again . Knowing I would be away from my laptop for a couple of weeks terrified me . I would have minimal time to post and I would have virtually no time to promote . So I bit the bullet and posted just on Monday for a few weeks . The result ? Shocking . I had three times the views on my posts at the end of every week . They were shared twice as much and a few of them went semi-viral on Pinterest giving me thousands of repins and thus , thousands of unique visitors and views . <p> Publishing a post every Monday has changed my blog and my life . I have time again . Time to plan , time to write , time to properly engage with my readers , time to be more creative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a growing blog ! <p> Its really scary to try to do less in order to gain more but for your own sanity and ability to have an authentic voice I highly recommend it .

Once we discovered our Doodle was an ice cube fiend I had a brain wave to combine his love of treats with his addiction to ice cubes ! I 'm going to share with you , the recipes our Dood loves . <p> If you are confused about what human food is safe for your dog to eat and what is harmful then run a quick search first . Its better to be safe than sorry and I am not an expert . As far as pantry staples go , here 's a quick list of things you might already have that is a-ok to give to your dog ! <p> Peanut Butter <p> Natural Yogurt <p> Carrots <p> Bananas <p> Blueberries <p> Strawberries <p> Pineapple <p> Cantaloupe <p> Sweet Potato ( cooked ) <h> Darby Delights <p> To make Darbys favorite frozen treats , pictured above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray ) . I like the silicon molds as they 're easy to extract the treats . <p> Each treat is nothing but a Tbsp of natural yogurt combined with a Tbsp of peanut butter and added goodies , in this case banana and carrot . <p> Layer the bottom of the shaped mold with your mixture then place diced banana ( or carrot ) on top , cover with another layer of peanut butter/yogurt mixture until shape is full . <p> Set in the freezer for 5 or 6 hours . <p> If your pup has a sensitive stomach and cant handle peanut butter then simply freeze some of the doggy approved fruits/snacks in water like a regular ice cube . Hell appreciate the treat and the cool-down at the end of his hard work licking the ice ! <p> A few Summers ago in Ireland we had our first Summer season of consistent good weather in years . The beaches were packed until all hours of the night , there was n't a pair of shorts left to purchase and I 'm sure most of the population was 90% made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish tan lines , what haunts me most about that Summer is the number of dog fatalities that occurred . I heard locally of two dogs dying from heat stroke and a number of other reports nationwide . In one tragic case , two litter mates at once . My heart was broken . People often underestimate a dogs ability to regulate their temperatures and expel heat efficiently . Hint : they are not good at keeping themselves cool . <p> As a dog owner in Georgia , I am very conscious of the effects of the intense heat and humidity on my dog . In fact , when choosing the breed to best fit our family the weight of the puppys coat was one of our top considerations ( F.Y.I. we went with a Labradoodle ) If you 're moving to sunnier climes and are concerned about what to do to keep your pup cool , read on ! <h> Recognizing Heat Stroke in Dogs <p> The onset of heat stroke in a dog can be quick and fatal . Only half of dogs who suffer from it , survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch for to ensure you dogs safety in the heat . <p> Know your breed . Some breeds will be more susceptible to heat stroke than others due to their respiratory system capabilities ( be careful with pugs , bulldogs and what I like to call muggy dogs ) . <h> Treating A Dog With Heat Stroke <p> Cool him down by rubbing him down with a wet towel , focusing on his head . Do n't  use ice . <p> Alternatively , lightly spray him down with the hose . <h> 11 Tips To Keep Your Dog Cool In The Heat <p> This goes without saying but never leave your dog in a hot car . <p> Never leave your dog outside to be exposed to extreme temperatures . What feels hot to you is much hotter for your pet . Ensure he/she has plenty of shade or a temperature regulated shelter to go into . Dogs can absolutely get sunburnt , do n't  be fooled into thinking this is a myth they can also burn their pads on hot concrete . <p> WATER ! Another obvious one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If possible replace it often with cooler water and if you can not be there make sure it is in the shade or somewhere it can not evaporate . Use a heavy bowl/container to make it difficult for your pup to tip it over . <p> Ice cubes ! I do n't  know about yours but my pup is an ice cube fiend . He will sit at the fridge at any given time hoping one might magically appear . If you 're out enjoying the sunshine and your four legged friend wants to join , fill one of his bowls with ice cubes and let him sit in the shade working on them . Alternatively , if he is n't into chewing ice cubes just add them to his water to keep it cooler . Consider freezing a toy in a block of ice for him to work out . <p> The hose . Friend or foe ? Some dogs are terrified of the hose , others love it . Our guy is 50/50 depending on his mood or whether he s feeling more Labrador or Poodle that day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with water but last week he braved a sprinkler attachment and had a little drink from it ! If you have an in-ground sprinkler system they may also like to dash through that . <p> Purchase a childrens plastic swimming pool . Yes , really ! They love it . If your dog is outside a lot then be sure to fill the pool and let him have a dip whenever he wants . <p> If you have a water baby on your hands then take him swimming ! From Memorial Day to Labor Day most popular beaches will have dog restrictions although some remain dog friendly year-round . Check out the rules in your area to avoid a hefty fine . Keep your dog on a leash and take him for a dip . If you 're land-locked and your swimming facilities happen to be lakes then ensure you enter the water at a safe access point . <p> If you do not have AC and are leaving the house make sure there is a fan near your dogs crate or wherever he sleeps . Avoid cushions and blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool floor under his belly . <p> Do not over-exert your dog . If you run with your dog or take him on very long walks then change your routine during the Summer . I walk the Dood at 6-6.30 am to beat the heat . His second walk occurs at about 8/9pm and even then it is extremely warm . <p> If you have a particularly hairy breed of dog , completely shaving him can actually be harmful . He will be used to regulating his temperature with his current coat and will be unable to manage without it . Certainly thin out the coat but reconsider an extreme shave . <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358 
@@48796269 @2296269/ <p> When I first started blogging I did n't  even consider my niche . I just wrote about what I was doing , my current situation , things that were of interest to me at that time , etc . I quickly discovered that to promote and connect with fellow bloggers my blog needed to have some type of niche in order to reach like-minded bloggers . I struggled with this definition for the first month . I was Irish , newly married and recently emigrated to the US . I liked fashion , food and travel but did n't  want my blog to be categorized so narrowly under any of these things . Getting my head around that mish-mash of interests and circumstances was hard for me and I found it difficult to , as the saying now goes , find my tribe . I came to accept that my blog is a lifestyle blog that focuses on a healthy mix of all of the above . But what 's more important is that I stopped worrying about fitting in and just continued writing . You will read a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking to your niche and while that is necessary in business , if you are blogging for fun then my response to that is , " who said so ? ! " <p> After publishing posts consistently and learning what my viewers liked the most I started to settle into my own blog and became more confident when hitting publish . I was never overly confident that the content was good but happy with what I was saying and HOW I was saying it . Although you strive to give your readers what they want , it is of the utmost importance to write what YOU want , too . Your viewers have come to your site because they like you and your content , they will return if they love it . If they leave , so be it . More will come . <p> As I said in my last post , I have seen people switch niches a lot . There 's many reasons for going beyond the limits of your niche . Perhaps you are after getting bogged down in an area you no longer have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , you had a travel blog but are now settling down into motherhood and want to focus on writing articles on parenting . Or you have been blogging about college life but are now entering the working world . There 's an array of reasons to re-brand your blog but there is NEVER a reason to not be true to yourself in your writing . <p> Which brings me back from my tangential rambling to the idea of writing in your voice . Of course I do n't  mean voice in the traditional sense- but the portrayal of your personality through the words you write . You are unique and your writing style should be too . If you are a really funny and bubbly person but write in a monotonous tone with none of the humor you possess naturally then your content will not be authentic . And although we live in a world where we can fake happiness , good fortune and popularity quite easily via social media , your blog will expose a greater portion of yourself to the world . Make that section of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful and people are perceptive beings . Posts repeatedly written in any voice but your own will be transparent and shallow . Your readers will not trust you or your content and wont engage . <p> The first thing I notice when reading blog posts , or any piece of writing for that matter , is the writing style . Now I 'm not saying mine is good . I 'm a serial user of cliches and slang which is considered vulgarity and terrible writing by some ( or most ) . In the world of professional writing I would more than likely be be condemned ! I do strive to improve my writing skills and blogging refreshes a great deal of lessons already learned about writing but when it comes to writing posts I often skip the- rules and mechanics of composing the perfect piece of literature as I try to write them as an exact reflection of myself and what I might say in a discussion with a real life person ! The wit , sarcasm , humor whatever you want to label it is exactly how I converse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are people who like my posts , those who can take or leave them and others whod rather poke out their eyes than read to the bottom . I 'm totally ok with that ! Well I 'd prefer if you held onto your eyes but I 'm fine with you leaving . Not everyone shares the same interests and opinions . <p> The way that I write , is genuine . The feelings I express , are genuine . My sentiments when I comment on your posts , are genuine . Being a genuine person is what I respect the most in any human being . I have no time for any single trait that is a fraction less than honest . <p> When I borderline stalk every social media platform you use , I love your blog ! When I like your pictures , I genuinely like your pictures . When I share your content , I really do think you have a message worth sending out . I like all of these things about you because you have probably won me over by writing in your own voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ havent found your blogging voice yet , ask yourself before publishing is this for the glory of a spike in views , free products , money , etc. ? If the answer is yes to any of the above , then I suggest you save your draft and go back to the drawing board . <p> For those of you pouring your heart and soul into your blog and feeling like you need to start writing as someone else to fit in stop it ! Explore the boundaries of your niche , find new forums to join , freshen up your content but for the love of God , keep writing in your own voice ! <h> If you struggle with finding your voice , what is it about blogging that limits your authenticity ? <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358

@@48796275 @2296275/ <h> How Military Life Changes You <p> Before I met my husband I liked to think I was relatively in tune with who I was as a person . Fun fact : I was n't . At all . <p> Marrying the military ( because let 's face it , your relationship with the Army ends up being more demanding than the relationship with your spouse ) taught me a lot about myself and better still , inspired me take a good hard look at my weaknesses and change a little . <p> Change ? Yeah , yeah . " A leopard never changes his spots " , " once a . , always a . " and all those other bitter , overused phrases . Well I call BS on that . I think people are so conditioned into thinking that change or personal growth is beyond the realm of attainability that they have become utterly relentless in their views . Well sorry Mr. Pessimist but personal growth is a realistic and achievable concept ! If were the first to point out someone changing in a negative sense , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life Changes You <h> Flexibility <p> Are you someone like me who likes to have a plan ? You are ? Great . Well forget it . In the military its almost impossible to plan the time you can sit down to dinner let alone a date or a trip away . All this is dependent on your significant others particular- job of course but in this life flexibility is a must . Having a vision of what you want to do is fine but carefully executed plans rarely come to fruition which often leads to disappointment . Some people fly by the seat of their pants and are perfectly fine living day to day . I , however , like to plan things to a tee and unfortunately to cope with this , it is often best for me to fear the worst case scenario rather than feel deflated , daily . Its not everyones cup of tea and probably not the healthiest coping mechanism but I 've found myself a lot less disappointed and better again , a lot less angry . <h> Adaptability <p> If your service member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a given that you will probably move tens of times throughout your marriage . No mean feat ! Even if you are associated with the military for a short time then the chances of living in three or four different places is realistic . Moving so often is NOT easy , aside from the usual moving headaches it creates obstacles concerning the education of your children , the length of your career ( or if you 'll even be able to have one ) , the quality of- your relationships to name but a few . Youve got to be able to pack up and move your life in a very short time period and there 's also the possibility of a short-notice deployment in which you very suddenly find yourself spouse-less and/or a single mother for many months . <h> Strength <p> Its pretty obvious from what Ive mentioned above that being strong is n't a choice in the military . Its an absolute necessity . <p> Were all human though . Do we have ridiculous moments of weakness where we cry in our driveways- because its late at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so terrified of the hose you 're trying to wash his paw with so unsuccessfully that you then think he s choking because you 're pulling so hard on his collar to get him to STAY STILLLLLLLL and you only have two hands ? <p> Yes that happens . Or so someone told me . <h> Gratitude <p> The harder my life has become as a result of being involved with the military , the greater the appreciation I have for everything , really. - My surroundings , my family , my friends , all of the wonderful things I am fortunate to have like my own home and the ability to travel extensively . It changes your view of what matters . Being grateful for the smallest things is a blessing that comes from the darker moments when you feel the worst you ever have in your whole life . <h> Knowing What 's Important <p> None of us are invincible , this we know but military life is sobering . The value of supportive family and friends is a lesson learned immediately . Most people on any military installation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . Not having a support system nearby is extremely tough and the friends you will make along your military journey can be friends for life . On the other hand , military towns can be some of the trashiest and most dramatic places you will find yourself . Unless you 're that way inclined , stay out of this . It will do nothing for your happiness and you wo n't find friends or genuine support in these people . I highly recommend making new friends but thread carefully until you 're comfortable trusting them . <p> Being the spouse of a service member undoubtedly changes you . I simultaneously love and hate every second of this journey but if given the choice , I would n't change a thing . It truly is the making of who I am . <p> I think I *could* do something like this , but being patient and understanding at the expense of my selfish benefit is not a forte of mine . I would like to think that if I were in this situation I would rise above but right now I can just applaud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you deserve ( from both your husband AND the military ! ) <p> I think its very brave of you , I know military service is very though and your husband must be away a lot of time . However , I also heard that military couples are the ones that stay together for all their life , because of the bond and the support that creates between them . <p> Thanks for this lovely post and a great insight in the life of military and family and so on . My son in law is in the Navy , I know it can be very hard , I am always happy if he does n't  get send out . He has served in Afghanistan a few years ago , for 6 months . It was a horrible time , always hoping that he will come back , and that he will come back healthy ! I do have a huge respect for any soldier ! Wishing you all the Best , god bless ! <p> The human nature , by its very being , is not rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit , but still our habits are not set in stone . Its only the desire for change that keeps us still . <p> I too am like you and absolutely love to have a plan ha ha . I would find this so difficult ! Kudos to you for being able to adapt and support your other half . Thanks for the post , Loved getting a little insight into the military wife life . xx <p> Thank you for this post . I 've recently started dating someone in the service and it is difficult to grasp , but I am slowly learning.I admire anyone who has a spouse in the military and can do the long distance relationshipbecause its tough especially when you have children involved . <p> I do n't  think I could do it ! I like to plan too much ! Not to mention all of my friends who have been virtually single mothers because their husbands have been deployed ! I thank him for his service and applaud you for standing by him . <p> My dad served as an officer for over 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he and my mom got married and got out when I was about 12 ( they had me a little later ) . My parents always made moving seem like a big adventure when I was a kid , and even though they liked seeing new places , theyve recently told me just how hard it is . People do n't  know what military spouses and families go through ! Thank you both for your service and hang in there lady = <p> I definitely understand why they played the " were going on a big adventure " game ! Even to a child , the moving can be extreme and the more means of creating normalcy , the better ! The moving is difficult but for me the separation is the killer . Its very hard to maintain any form of intimacy in a relationship when even conversing is rare . It takes a LOT of work , commitment and sacrifice despite feeling like you get nothing in return .

When I would climb into the car and hit the road from Waterford to Mayo and think that 5 hours on the road was FOREVER . Now a five hour road trip is like a brief Sunday spin to me . <p> In the last 18 months we have driven over 11,000 miles ( props to my husband who did ALL of that as I waited for my license ! ) . From Georgia to Alabama and Florida multiple times and to Missouri and Ohio for special occasions . Soon we embark on a 21 hour journey from Northern Wisconsin to Georgia .

Take a flask full of hot coffee/tea if iced is n't your style . Avoid carbonated drinks . <p> Sunglasses and lip balm are two small things I often forget but make my journey very uncomfortable do n't  make the same mistake . <p> My greatest tip of all would be to just relax . So many times I have been anxious over arrival and hotel check-in times that I have found- those are the journeys where you run into 2 hour stand-stills on the Interstate .

How do you keep your succulents alive in the first place ? ! <p> This post may contain affiliate links <p> After a disastrous first round ( RIP ) I have managed to keep my second lot of succulents alive .

There 's nothing stopping you planting multiple succs in one terrarium/container just make sure they are n't  on top of one another . Even succulents like personal space . <p> Light . Give them enough of it . Because succulents are hardy and need less watering than normal plants , people tend to think they do n't  need to be cared for in other areas either . Do n't  neglect your babies ! Succulents love light just not direct sunlight . Make sure they are positioned to get a few hours of light a day . If your plants do n't  get enough light theyll stretch toward the light and get leggy . This is a good time to propagate . <p> Temperature . Make sure they 're warm enoughand cool enough !

Succulents only need to be watered when their soil is completely dry so check if the soil is still soggy before their next drink ! <p> Drainage . They love well draining , gritty soil . Ideally your container of choice needs to have a drainage hole so that the soil does n't  remain soggy and drown your succulents . <p> Food . Give them a treat !

I do n't  feel like standing for an hour trying to dry my hair with one of those pathetic hospital/hotel dryers that feels like a small child is blowing on your head . <p> A flattering , soft jersey midi dress for going home in comfort , easeand style . <h> The Will I Need This ? Stuff- ( To Be Left In The Car ! ) <p> Do you get the sense that I 'm an organization over-achiever ? ! Every hospital is different . Some will give you everything you need and others will let you fend for yourself for the most part . At least through extensive research on this , that 's the general consensus . So while many moms tell you point blank what not to bring , others have said they werent provided with it at all . <p> This is the stuff I am unsure about and have packed in a tote bag that will stay in the car .

Despite buying newborn and 0-3 months in various brands , they all differ . Some look tiny and others look far too big . I do n't  want to take a thousand outfits with me but I would like them to fit baby , whatever size he or she turns out to be . This way I 'll have at least 2/3 outfits that will fit . <h> The Items I 'm NOT Packing <p> My own labor/delivery gown . I 100% plan to deliver baby in the hospital issued gown . I 'm vain but not spend $50+ on a designer labor gown vain . An item of clothing that will most likely end up covered in bodily fluids and newborn gunk . <p> A pillow from home . For the same reasons as above and also because there are about 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Athletic Pants . A lot of women suggest yoga pants or some form of comfy pants for after the birth . While I totally agree with the comfort factor , I understand there will be a LOT of checking down there after baby arrives . I will be in no mood to keep wriggling my way out of leggings for my nurse . Nightgowns it is ! <p> Hair tools . Straighteners , curling irons etc . Some people recommend them for photos but I do n't  see it happening even considering as fussy as I can be with my hair ! Ill be blast drying and curling my hair around a headband to get loose waves for going home day ! <p> Spring has sprung and so has my baby bump ! At 34 weeks pregnant , I am feeling lethargic , anxious and less than attractive . One sure fire way to improve my mood when I 'm feeling down is to dress myself up . Dressing up while eight months pregnant however , is no easy task . You are more than likely bored stiff of wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast selection of gorgeous maternity dresses . <p> This post was in partnership with Pink Blush . As always , all opinions are my own . <p> I wanted something feminine and comfortable to serve me throughout the rest of my pregnancy in a warm Georgia Spring . I was also keen to find something that could be worn postpartum for easy nursing . None of us are the perfect size and shape but I find it especially hard to shop for dresses to suit my frame as I am 6 feet tall . Short dresses on me could be deemed a criminal offense and typically , maxi dresses sit somewhere in the middle of my shins hot stuff ! So for me , finding the perfect midi dress is like hitting the jackpot . <p> To flatter the bump and to suit babys nursing needs , I chose this hi-lo style midi number . Nothing says Goodbye , Winter ! like a pretty floral print and a little big of leg ! I instantly fell in love with the dress that ticked all the boxes . This dress not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sins and is SO comfortable . That equates to the trifecta of cute maternity clothes in case you did n't  know ! <p> I noticed the companys tagline is Effortless styles for the modern mother and theyve certainly got it right . Pregnancy clothes are typically NOT cute , let 's be honest ! If you 're searching for gorgeous , on-trend maternity wear , then I suggest taking a look at Pink Blush . You 'll find not only maternity wear but regular sizes , plus sizes , shoes and accessories too . <p> I was always aware that babies are expensive little beings but I quickly realized just how expensive . It was an eye-opening experience setting up for baby ! I am so grateful to our families for gifting us the big ticket items like the stroller , car seat , crib etc . Between those gifts , re-purposing furniture , building our own ( thanks husband ) and my own frugality we have managed to set up for baby at a fraction of the real cost . Hopefully this post will give you an eye for a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I am not in any way stingy . In fact , I have champagne taste but live with a sparkling water budget . I would definitely call myself frugal . I shop around A LOT and a nose around Goodwill is not beneath me , especially when they carry department store overstock ( OMG ! ) . My favorite stores for great deals are Home Goods , TJ Maxx and- sometimes , one particular Ross near my home . The gems to be found in these stores are hard to beat but its often luck of the draw with what bargain they may have in stock on the day you 're visiting . This is the perfect excuse to go often ! <h> Where To Find The Best Baby Bargain <h> Goodwill <p> A year ago I walked into my local Goodwill ( my first Goodwill trip ever ) and quickly turned my nose up . I actually said EW . Fast forward to 2016 and while doing a donation drop-off at a brand new store , I gave it another chance and wandered into the baby clothes section . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty quickly that bang in the middle of 4 different Goodwill stores in my locale are two Army installations . Army posts mean families moving in and out of the area constantly . This in turn means families purging their unwanted items often . The presence of military families also means there 's lots of babies around . While many , many adult garments at Goodwill may be ratty and suspect , the baby clothes are in a league of their own . Over the course of about 8 weeks I have purchased a hoard of completely unworn or worn-once onesies and full outfits . My total is usually under $6 and I come away with 6-8 outfits . <p> Honestly , I often feel guilty buying at Goodwill . I feel like I am stealing the eyes out of someones head . They have a color-of-the-week offer which means that if you have a bunch of items on your arm bearing that color plastic barb , then that item is half price . In the infant section , this means your outfit could cost you just 49- ! On Sundays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some of my Goodwill gold includes <p> Enough adorable infant clothing to dress every baby in North America . I will re-donate any items I do n't  end up using . Brands including Ralph Lauren , Tommy Hilfiger , GAP , Janie &amp; Jack , OshKosh , Little Me , Carters and more ( 49-99- per item ) <p> V-Tech Light &amp; Move Learning Ball- that has been thoroughly disinfected and is like brand new ( $1.99 -versus- $14.99 ) <p> Two soft fold-out books including a Winnie the Pooh clip on stroller book with a tag on . Both washed like a dream ( 39- each -versus $7-10 ) <h> TJ Maxx <p> Ok , while TJ is one of my favorite stores , it can be as hit and miss as Goodwill . Their inventory changes constantly so if you spot something you have to snap it up there and then . I promise you it wont be there next week , or even later that day . I have found so many baby items at a fraction of the cost and though most of their stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got is still this current seasons styles and prints . Have a good look at something you like in case it is damaged ( it probably is n't ) and put it in your cart pronto ! Sometimes the flaw and reason an item is there is a tiny as a seam sewn off center . If you are n't  fussy , you will never even notice . <h> Marshalls <p> At Marshalls you will find similar things to TJ or even the same . If you cant find what you need at one , be sure to check the other . <h> Ross <p> I do n't  shop here very often . In fact I have purchased something from a Ross store only twice . This past weekend I was looking for something specific so I perused my local and nicest Ross ! I did n't  buy one because I have one already but they had Boppy Nursing pillows for $24 ! Granted , it was n't the cutest slipcover they make but those bad boys retail for $39.99 ! <p> I did buy a large faux sheepskin area rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere ! <h> Home Goods <p> I LOVE Home Goods . This place is the dream for kitting out babys room for a bargain . With goods much like Marshalls and TJ Maxx but with a focus on the decor side of things , obviously . Some of my finds include ; <p> More hangers ! <p> Storage boxes/Laundry Hamper ( $4-25 -versus- $15-50+ ) <p> Diaper caddies ( $6-12 -versus- $20+ ) <p> Clip on musical crib nightlight/soother ( $6 -versus $20+ ) <p> A-Z Bookends ( $7 -versus- $20+ ) <h> Amazon <p> Amazon may not be a discount store per se but as I am a Prime member it has been worth every cent . As a Prime member I qualify for free two-day shipping , unlimited free TV/movie streaming , unlimited photo storage , access to Prime Pantry ( groceries on your door step ?

If you subscribe to a total of 5 items at once then the 5% savings on each one becomes 15% ! The bargain price of sub $25 for 200+ diapers and peace of mind that they will arrive on my doorstep in 48 hours is especially worth it to me . I subscribe to dog food , baby wipes and other personal items which means I never have to remember them on my weekly grocery shop . <p> I am so happy with my baby bargain stockpile as I get such a kick out of having exactly what I wanted and still having a little extra cash in my purse !

From the start I chose to go with Bluehost . Of course you do n't  have to purchase a domain name at all . You can use any amount of free platforms to host your blog . However , if you plan to monetize your blog through ads or affiliates then many of the free options will not allow you to do that . Make sure you know what 's what . <p> You are your brand .

While some bloggers have a blatant niche by default ( travel , food , fashion , technology etc . ) I do n't  believe that every blog requires such strict boundaries . Most bloggers label their site lifestyle , inc. me for descriptive reasons . I do n't  necessarily stick to this . Your blog will evolve just as much as you will as a person . I started mine to write about the trials and tribulations of adapting to a new life in the US , the challenges of being a military spouse and talking about my home in Ireland . Since then I have given into my creative side and posted many recipes , DIYs and started to pursue a potential photography career . Towards the end of the year my blog took a rapid swing toward pregnancy and parenting with the impending arrival of my first baby . Next year I hope to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that field which will see the blog take more of a business oriented turn . In particular if you are blogging for fun , do not be bound by rules . Its your blog . There are none ! <p> Connect with like-minded people . For business , this is really important . You must have a target audience and know where to seek them out and connect . Do n't  waste too much of your time promoting to the wrong people . For-fun blogging is different , while you may have the most in common with bloggers in your niche ( I am trying to use the term loosely ) there 's no harm in connecting with others too . <p> Do n't  be a selfish group member . Blog groups are a great way to connect with other bloggers , seek advice and promote your blog . Many of these groups offer promotion threads where you can leave a link to be viewed/commented on/shared etc . In return , you must do the same for X amount of other links . These groups have been invaluable to me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , there are a vast number of people who drop their links , do not reciprocate , do not follow any of the rules and even refer to the threads as chore threads ( HA ! ) . Unfortunately you cant do anything about others lack of integrity . You will come to recognize the bad apples pattern and not waste your time , instead giving your time and connection to worthy , honest group members . <p> You can get what you want , if you 're willing to work for it . If your blog is for fun , you can have immense fun blogging . If your blog is to impact change , you can impact change . If your blog is monetized through ads and sponsored posts then you can work with brands . If your blog is for your business , you can promote your business . Obvious , right ? Well it all ties in with my last point . If you are hard working , honest and build the right network all of these individual goals are achievable. - I personally know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of blogging , people who have used their blogs to get into a position to fulfill a personal goal of theirs ( eg , writing/publishing a book , selling a physical product they have created or simply sending out a message for nothing in return ) . I blog predominantly for fun although I have made money through ads , working with brands and posted affiliate links on occasion . In general I do not seek sponsorship but will collaborate if I like the brand . I have turned down many sponsored opportunities because I did n't  like the product/brand . I wo n't post about things I do not like , use or have any interest in because they offer me cash . <p> Get creative . I have always been creative but in recent years I spent so much time up to my eyes in technological academia that I did n't  allow myself a creative outlet . Since launching my blog I have embraced arts , crafts , cooking etc. more than I ever have . Other bloggers have been more inspirational to me than I realized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog has in turn reignited my love for photography ( that I knew nothing about ) . I am just about finished a year long professional course and am in the process of signing up for more advanced modules to see where the future takes me with that . I aim to be less lazy with my images and ditch the iPhonography Ive been habitually posting as my blog graphics and use my brand new Canon more and more . Its amazing what avenues a blog is capable of taking you down , embrace them . You may very well find yourself doing something unexpected and realizing its your calling ! <p> Know your copyright rights . I have had many cases of suspiciously similar posts popping up days after posting mine but twice this year I had incidents of word-for-word plagiarism . It is so disheartening as well as infuriating that people just steal your work from under you . Sometimes its also comical the way they utterly deny it despite time stamps and welllogic . Have a copyright statement on your content . It helps to know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripped off . <p> Get to know social media trends . This was my biggest mountain to ascend . I have a love/hate relationship with social media and unfortunately you can not get away from it when blogging . I have come to love Pinterest the most . Not only is it my biggest traffic driver and largest social following but it feeds my creative side and aids my photography/blog skills . Facebook is my enemy . Reach is poor no matter how strategically you play the game and Ive known some bloggers to lose their pages without any explanation . I use it a couple of times a week but it is n't my be all and end all . I love Instagram , obviously , because photography is a big hobby of mine but when it comes to the blog I am wary of it . The vast majority of IG followers only follow to gain a follower themselves . Shortly after , they may unfollow ! I personally follow accounts of profiles I genuinely like or resonate with . Otherwise , I do not see a point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your insights will show you what your followers like and when they like to see it . Keep your content true to you but give it to them when they want it . <p> Time does n't  have to be your enemy . Do n't  be afraid to take a break ! I was totally overwhelmed with blogging at the beginning . What I did know is that I wanted to post consistently so I posted three times per week but I was n't happy . I had zero time and my content was crappy . I cut one post and started putting out two and have since whittled it down to just once per week . On occasion I will post twice . Read here to see how posting less actually benefited my blog and increased my traffic ! If you are in the blogging biz and have to be connected at all times then you should consider paid scheduling services or even hiring a virtual assistant . <p> Embrace change . Your blog changes on your terms but sometimes external factors change it for you . Example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are unwilling to budge or be diverse with content , your readers will get bored and disengage . Do n't  be afraid of trying something new . If it does n't  work , try something else ! <p> So here 's to another year , a new baby and seeing where this blogging journey continues to take me ! <p> The pregnancy journey is thrilling , especially for first time mothers . You want to scream it from the roof tops while simultaneously wanting to not tell anyone out of- sheer worry . In our social media age a tendency to share every facet of lives exists for many . Whether its a status on Facebook , a photo on Instagram or a witty one liner on twitter its so easy to share your excitement without fully acknowledging exactly who can see it . I admit it myself that sometimes I snap a photograph with social media in mind and not solely to capture a memory . <p> Let 's be honest , many of use have friends on social media we would n't exactly consider to be close . Platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your content . This is why for the most part I have n't documented too many milestones of my pregnancy on the blog . I find it rather eerie to think about who might be reading about such a personal experience of mine . <p> That said , I read blogs daily where people go into graphic detail about the inner workings of their womb . Some announce their pregnancy on the day they discover it . Others declare the gender of their baby to the public . I have even seen some publish teaser posts inviting readers to guess babys name ! This is definitely a different pregnancy world to the one I knew growing up . Or at least the one I thought I knew . I personally am more private about my pregnancy . It is overwhelmingly exciting but I would rather contain that excitement within the bounds of my family and friends . <p> My crux with baring all throughout pregnancy however is not what I read online . I take no issue with what women choose to post and fully admit to thoroughly enjoying many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet in the street <p> Whether it is due to being surrounded by such open accounts of pregnancy or just a- general sense of entitlement I have been taken aback by some of the questions I am asked on a regular basis . As soon as the bump popped and my pregnancy became apparent , I noticed that some people took it as a green light to ask pretty personal questions . Or at least questions I feel are inappropriate and would n't dream of asking others . <h> My Top Three Irritating Pregnancy Questions ! <p> What are you having ? <p> This one is the only one that makes me genuinely mad and want to respond with a passive aggressive , " a baby " . I do not believe that because some people happily announce their babys gender that it is free game in every other pregnancy . What makes people think they have a right to such a deeply intimate fact ? <p> Another question comes with this one and it is , " Do you know but are n't  saying ? " or " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have been given a firm , " we have n't found out " then please accept it and move on . <p> What names are you thinking of ? <p> Note , this is n't the question " have you considered any names ? " . This question seeks to know what those names are . BEFORE YOUR BABY ARRIVES . The baby is going to come out of me faster and more easily than that information . Keep walking . <p> When are you due ? because you 're tiny *stares at bump* <p> Admittedly , this is not an offensive question at all . However it is when paired with a disapproving glance at your belly and a comment about your size . Please stop skinny shaming me . I am 6ft tall and there 's plenty of torso for baby to hide in . FYI my baby is slightly above normal fetal growth rate ! Relax . <p> I have n't documented much of my pregnancy on the blog because I wanted to keep it private but now a part of me wishes I had ! Time has flown by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really are. - Its hard to believe I am in the final weeks of this pregnancy single digits now ! <p> I swore at the beginning I would take a weekly bump photo and it saddens me that I did n't  . I was either too busy , feeling too gross or just forgot until I was already into another week . During the first 16 weeks , there was no bump to photograph anyway ! Personally , I like to read about what different women experience at different stages . No two pregnancies are the same but it can be comforting to know what you could expect or even just know you are n't  alone in what you are experiencing. - Now that I have officially entered the third trimester , I have decided to post a little update . <h> How far along ? <p> 30 weeks <h> Babys Size <p> A cantaloupe according to my app ! Baby weighs over 3.5 lbs <h> Total weight gain <p> 18 lbs <h> Maternity clothes <p> Over-the-bump jeans ( H&amp;M Mama maternity skinny jeans are LIFE ! They are super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some maternity tops since week 25 although most werent necessary they were just cute . I still have many wearable non-maternity tops . All my leggings are my pre-pregnancy ones . <h> Stretch marks <p> None , yet but the itchiest skin &gt;. &lt; <h> Sleep <p> Theres three scenarios here : <p> If I can get to sleep at a decent hour , I am out until baby uses my bladder as a punching bag . Which is usually about 1000 times a night . In this case I usually get back to sleep . <p> I get to sleep after midnight but then sleep through until the early morning . <h> Longing for <p> To nest . All day every day . I have an insatiable desire to organize ALL THE THINGS ! <p> A somewhat comfortable sleep position . <p> To finally meet baby . <h> Movement <p> Lots and lots . Its always a party in there . Mostly early in the morning , late afternoon and around 10pm . Now that baby is getting a bit cramped in there , the movements are lessviolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If I had to say anything I would say cinnamon rolls . But you do n't  need to be pregnant to want those all the time . <h> Nausea <p> Some occasional morning weakness before breakfast . Since I was so sick in the first trimester I figure it will strike again somewhere in the third . <h> Gender <p> Waiting for baby to reveal all ! <h> Symptoms <p> Indigestion after most foods but not so much heartburn , difficulty sleeping , back ache , fatigue , general lack of motivation to do anything and although my bump is small the beginning of a very attractive waddle . <h> Belly button in or out ? <p> A weird , neither in nor out at the moment and it freaks me out so much . <h> Wedding rings on or off ? <p> Still on although at the end of most days they do n't  want to come off . <h> Happy or moody most of the time <p> Both . Predominantly moody though . Mostly feeling a mix of excitement and overwhelm in these weeks where baby has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nursery , finalizing name options , trying to relax knowing everything is ready ( HA ! When will that be ? ! ) and giving you another update ! <p> Valentines Day is a month away and in stores its hard to avoid . In fact , I saw Valentine outfits for babies in DECEMBER ! What in the world ? ! I do n't  typically observe Valentines Day in any major way like decorating the house or giving lavish presents but I do like to acknowledge it in small ways . I typically love all holidays but I guess I 'm a bit of a Valentines scrooge . One thing I can get on board with over Valentines Day are the treats ! Give me all the yummy meals , decadent desserts and sweets ! If you do n't  buy into the fancy , over-priced candlelit dinners and extravagant gifts then why not acknowledge your Valentine with a homemade sweet treat . You cant ever go wrong with chocolate cake so I whipped up these easy chocolate cupcakes and got into the festivities with a delicious pink champagne frosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese = <p> There 's always one . In every situation , pregnant or not there is always one negative person who has nothing positive to say on the matter . In pregnancy , the same applies . Whether its strangers patting your belly or unsolicited advice , there 's plenty of negativity to fill your nine months and beyond . <p> I was home in Ireland briefly and sadly , I kind of regret going . Not because I received negativity but because I received support . I am aware that seems incredibly cynical and negative . I was finally able to share the pregnancy journey with those who seemed concerned , interested and happy for me . I can not describe the feeling of going through such a special time and being the only one invested in it . So I wont even try but it was very hard to leave a loving , familiar environment and return to one void of such happiness . <p> I have come to discover here that when I am in the company of others , all I hear regarding my pregnancy is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my last post about struggling with my mental health throughout this pregnancy . The last thing any expectant first-time mother wishes to hear is what they are doing wrong or what will go wrong . It baffles me that at such a special time in life , the only sentiments offered are negative . With all due respect if you have nothing nice to say , then say nothing . <p> I understand that some people do n't  worry . I am a sensitive , intuitive person and worry comes with the territory . Do n't  get me wrong , I am confident in this pregnancy . If it werent for the external factors I would say I am loving it . But I have the normal apprehension that is to be expected when facing delivering your first baby . Fortunately , in my battalion I also have my intelligence , a strong maternal instinct and a drive to succeed . Maybe I internalize too much but I can not bear someone treating me like I know absolutely nothing . Condescending comments that almost infer I have n't held , cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Negativity about the way I eat , drink or choose to care for myself during the gestation . Telling me with a loud cackle how my house will never be the palace it is now , again . UGH . <h> Like snowflakes , fingerprints and pregnancies we are all unique . <p> Why is it so hard to live and let live ? In my rant I have digressed . I have taken too long to realize that the health and well-being of myself and my child trumps literally everything else in my life . Giving these people power over your emotions is the worst way to manage . You must continue on boldly and bravely in your pregnancy . You are the mother . That intuition is strong for a reason . You know what is best for you and for baby . Embrace the positivity you receive . Be thankful for those people and their kind words , generosity and support . Give them the space in your head and heart . <h> Dealing With Negative Nancy During Your Pregnancy <p> Bite your tongue <p> Smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state that you do not wish to discuss certain topics if they are too personal or invasive <p> Do n't  focus on the fact that your boundaries are being disrespected and allow it to become bitterness . Some people just truly believe they know everything <p> Try to remember that to them the advice is coming from a good place and not one of malice <p> Do n't  internalize it as condescension , often empty vessels simply make the most noise <p> The topic of self care is trendy right now but there is much more to it than a bandwagon . Finally , an idea with more substance than adulting or the apparently vital role Target plays in our lives . The new year brings high hopes , willingness to embrace change and goals , goals , goals ! This year , after an extremely emotionally demanding 2016 , my main goal is self improvement . This resolution was borne out of necessity . With my first baby arriving soon there is simply no choice to continue in the mental state I was in . Stress is not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure you have a safe , stress-free and happy pregnancy . Taking time for yourself is easier said than done but if I could prevent even one person from feeling the strain I have felt then I would be content . <p> Whether your stress is a direct result of work , relationship issues , financial problems etc. it does not matter . The physical affects of stress on your developing baby can be detrimental to their mental health in years to come . Even at this point I feel a large amount of guilt for inflicting my sadness and worries onto my baby . Clawing your way out of a rut is n't easy and casting aside fears is less so . With every kick and hiccup from inside I am reminded and determined to be the best version of myself . Both for the baby and for my own happiness . Sometimes you will come to realize that your expectations of support are nothing more than expectation and in that situation you must be everything you need by yourself . <h> " So what can I do to minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue , recognize that you need help and be able to admit it . Even if only to yourself . Fortunately with self care , YOU can help you .

@@48796281 @2296281/ <h> Morning Sickness Musts ! <p> If you follow the blogs social media accounts and saw my previous post , Little Pumpkin then you will already know that we are expecting ! Baby Scott arrives next Spring and we are so flippin excited ! Ive been very sick in my first trimester and I strive to do all that I can to help other women deal with morning sickness misery ! " Not another post about morning sickness ! " , I hear you cry . There are endless morning sickness remedies out there . How do I know how many there are ? Because I searched for them ALL . I read them all and I tried them all . Some worked wonders , other made me worse so I 've compiled a list of what kept me at my best during my worst ! Hopefully they can help you too . <p> Intuitively , I knew I would experience morning sickness . Its me . Everything turns my stomach , even at full health . I have a high pain tolerance but the weakest stomach and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaded nausea . I was 7 weeks 3 days at my initial prenatal exam and first ultrasound . The nurse asked me how I was feeling and I was on top of the world . She mused that I might be one of the lucky ones and I went home wondering if I was . <p> The very next day I woke up to the room spinning , stomach growling and vomit rising in my throat . T.M.I ? Get used to it . Pregnancy and dignity do n't  go hand in hand I 've found . <p> I was floored and it was a vicious cycle . I was feeling deathly sick but starving at the same time . Let 's face it the last thing you want when you are sitting on bathroom floor waiting to vomit is a big meal . I learned my lesson quickly though . The reason I was feeling so sick was because I needed food . I needed to eat something the second I woke up and last thing at night . As well as this , I needed to eat frequently to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> My Top 6 Morning Sickness Musts <p> Eat immediately upon waking and right before bedtime . In the morning I found a dry , crunchy granola bar would give me enough energy and tide me over while I was getting myself up and dressed . I would go downstairs and have breakfast right afterwards . At night time I would eat the same but maybe add a banana . This was enough to fill me in case I woke in the middle of the night . <p> Eat every 2 to 3 hours . This sounds excessive but for me it was the only way I got through my morning-noon-night sickness . I would eat at 9am , 12pm , 2/3pm , 5pm , 7pm and 9/10pm . Some of these were meals ( whatever I could keep down ) and the rest were light , dry and downright boring snacks . Meals consisted of A LOT of carbohydrates and other plain but filling foods . Bread , rice , pasta , cereals etc . Snacks were crackers , granola bars , oatmeal and fruits that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  skip on water . I know , I know , its impossible to drink liters of water while feeling so awful . I added a teaspoon of the juice of a fresh lemon to every bottle of water I drank to add some flavor . The tartness made it easier to swallow . The days where I slacked on my water intake were hell . My head spun and the nausea was undoubtedly stronger . Not to mention the most important factor all those fluids are necessary for babies development ! <p> Brew your own ginger tea . I both won and lost here . Who knew you could overdose on ginger ? Not this girl . Its rough . Trust me . I was so sick one day that I boiled the kettle , grated some fresh ginger and made my own tea . Grate your ginger into a bowl and pour hot water on top . Let it steep for a few minutes . Strain this water into a cup over a teaspoon of honey and a teaspoon of lemon then add more warm water . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bare half teaspoon of grated ginger is enough . I used too much ! The tea settled my stomach and I felt really good but the next two days were not pleasant . I had sent my body into a full digestive detox/cleanse and I do n't  need to describe that to anyone . <p> Put your go-to snacks EVERYWHERE . In the glove box of the car , in every handbag you own , in every pocket of your clothing , on your nightstand , on your coffee table , etc . Sometimes just walking to the pantry to get my food made the world spin . I liked to have things on hand at all times . <p> Something I struggled with during the worst weeks of sickness was the gross metallic taste in my excessively dry mouth . I tried sucking on glassy , fruity candy but was overwhelmed by sweetness . I recommend ginger candies just for the purpose of settling the stomach but the taste can become overpowering . What worked best for me in the end was peppermints and occasionally chewing gum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes my mind off the i 'll feeling . <p> As I said my sickness began at week 7 . It peaked at week 10 and by the very end of week 11 it became far more manageable . By the time week 12 rolled around I was waking up with more energy and barely any inkling of illness , which is typical of nearing the second trimester . The only time I feel sick now is if I allow myself to go far too long without eating . I really hope some of these tips work for someone else out there because it can feel downright hopeless and miserable . <p> I had terrible morning sickness with both of my pregnancies . Its awful . I would take the discomfort of the last month over the sickness &amp; exhaustion of the first month any day ! I agree with the eating every couple hours . If I got at all hungry , I was done for ! I had really good luck with Preggie Pop hard candies . They helped make the nausea a little more bearable . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's made with real ginger ) . Good luck , and congratulations ! ! <p> In my first pregnancy morning sickness came back after 30 weeks and was killing me insane . However , no to morning sickness tea gave me great relief and with my second baby I started drinking the tea just the sickness started in my first trimester and got my nausea alleviated . <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358

@@48796284 @2296284/ <p> Long time , no post my friends ! Its been 8 joyful ( and exhausting ) weeks of being a mother and I was long overdue a new post . I planned on taking a month long blog break ( HA ! ) but evidently I overestimated my abilities to juggle it all . Motherhood has been the steepest learning curve of my life but I would n't change it for the world . My crafty side has been twitching from being so stagnant and today I 'm bringing you this adorable DIY name project . Put your own spin on it and add the sweetest personal touch to babys room ! <p> I love my babys name . I should , should n't I ? I spent nine long months agonizing over what it might be and hopefully she likes it just as much ! Im amazed by the amount of people who have n't heard the name before . In case you have n't heard of it , here 's a little background . <p> I always wanted to display the babys name in the nursery but was n't sure how . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individually and since there are six of them in hers I was n't too wild about six permanent holes in my already terrible walls ! If you search baby name craft on Pinterest you will be able to scroll for hours through wood letter craft . Some of them were just too well , pinterest for me . I wanted something elegant and dainty yet without fuss . <p> To the craft store ! The best part of this was the fact that I bought everything I needed for under $15 ! I decided on scrapbook paper to decorate . Rather than sticking to one pattern I got four different kinds for a mismatched , feminine look . <p> Making the name was easy as pie . I simply drew around the letters on my paper of choice , carefully cut out the shape ( using a sharp scissors ! ) then mod podged it to the wood . Done ! <p> Initially , I was going to display the letters simply . I purchased a narrow frame shelf on Amazon with the intention of propping them up against the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and size of the shelf and so that was nixed . The shelf now displays some of her prettiest books in what turned into a happy accident ! In the end I chose to arrange the letters in a fun design and glue them together before hanging the name as one piece . I absolutely love how it turned out ! <h> Did you do any nursery craft ? Feel free to share in the comment section = <p> Do you struggle to keep your succulents alive ? Last Spring I posted Succulents for Beginners , a general beginners guide to planting and caring for your succulents . It was a big hit and I 'm so glad its been useful to tens of thousands of people . During the Summer I followed up with another post on how to propagate your plants . But I have left you hanging , succulovers and for that I apologize . Youve now purchased your succulents , chosen a whimsical planter and even learned how to propagate the clippings but what about the middle part ? How do you keep your succulents alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain affiliate links <p> After a disastrous first round ( RIP ) I have managed to keep my second lot of succulents alive . That 's a year now despite quite frankly , sometimes forgetting they exist . Considering I kill every other other plant ( that is n't a cactus/succulent ) , I call that a victory . One of them even survived a near fatal Labradoodle munching attack . Did I mention they 're hardy little guys ? <h> 8 Key Steps To Keeping Indoor- Succulents Alive <p> Space . Avoid overcrowding . I 'm guilty of this , especially if I buy a pre-arranged dish garden . I later re-pot them if they begin to suffer . Your succulents need space to breathe and grow . There 's nothing stopping you planting multiple succs in one terrarium/container just make sure they are n't  on top of one another . Even succulents like personal space . <p> Light . Give them enough of it . Because succulents are hardy and need less watering than normal plants , people tend to think they do n't  need to be cared for in other areas either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just not direct sunlight . Make sure they are positioned to get a few hours of light a day . If your plants do n't  get enough light theyll stretch toward the light and get leggy . This is a good time to propagate . <p> Temperature . Make sure they 're warm enoughand cool enough ! Succulents like to be warm in the Summer and cooler in the Winter months . <p> Ventilation . If you can , have some air flow around your plants . An open window or where all else fails , an air vent . This helps with the draining/drying of the soil and you can keep track of their watering needs . <p> Watering . Do n't  over-water . Succulents only need to be watered when their soil is completely dry so check if the soil is still soggy before their next drink ! <p> Drainage . They love well draining , gritty soil . Ideally your container of choice needs to have a drainage hole so that the soil does n't  remain soggy and drown your succulents . <p> Food . Give them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; succulents and feed them once in a while . <p> Species . Knowing which varieties you have and their specific needs is a good start to knowing how to keep them alive . <p> Christmas week is here ! Can you believe it ? Its a week of last minute scrambling , cleaning and preparation to go visit family for us . While Christmas is about so much more than presents gift buying , wrapping and giving is in full swing this week . I love thoughtful little gifts ! Who does n't  ? Its quite special to receive a gift that 's been handmade just for you ! That 's why I love putting together baskets and these DIY mason jar gifts . They are perfect as stocking fillers , for co-workers , secret Santa gift giving and even as last-minute gifts for the unexpected visitor ( weve all been there ! ) . <p> At this time of the year you may already have some or all of the ingredients for hot chocolate jars in your home depending on how sweet your tooth is . For me , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time of the year ! This particular jar has an added dose of chocolate in the form of chocolate chips ( I used Ghirardelli white chips for a richer flavor ) and a candy cane for stirring ! You could also get your peppermint flavor from a layer of crushed peppermints as a topping in the jar or by adding peppermint marshmallows instead of the regular kind . <h> You will need : <p> Ball Mason Jar or similar <p> Decorative ribbon or bakers twine <p> If you are super organized you could have some pre-printed labels for the lid ( I was not super organized ! ) . <h> Candy Cane Hot Chocolate <p> Hot Chocolate Mix <p> Mini White Chocolate Chips <p> Mini Marshmallows <p> Candy Cane <p> Add hot water or milk with two tablespoons from your jar and enjoy ! <p> Why not try some other hot chocolate flavors such as salted caramel , spiced white hot chocolate or even gingerbread ! <p> This blog has given me a serious case of craft-itis ! I get so much inspiration and motivation from reading hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft bug and I am thoroughly enjoying it . This week I tried my hand at a simple cloud pillow for Babys nursery . I can not sew . At all . Even a button , it WILL fall off again . I despise sewing . What I can do however , is handle a small , low-temperature hot glue gun ! <p> People often ask me if I 've chosen a theme for Babys nursery and honestly I had not , nor had I ever considered one . Unless you can call gender neutral a theme . Although I love to decorate and sit back to admire my handiwork , I get bored and over analytical . For me , something overly specific was an absolute no-no . <p> Let me tell you , choosing gender neutral decor is easier said than done . It seems these days that a lot of grey and rustic/outdoorsy decor is considered gender neutral . I personally think that stuff , although beautiful , is far more boyish than girly . After I had decided on a white crib and re-purposed my old TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! ) , I found the cutest cloud door handles on Etsy . What 's both baby appropriate and gender neutral ? The sky ! So I settled on clouds , stars , the moon etc. as my central theme that is n't a theme . <p> This easy peasy no-sew cutie will be complete in 30 minutes and costs less than $10-20 depending on where you buy your supplies and the quality you desire ! <h> You will need : <p> White fabric ( cotton , felt , fleece , velour its up to you ! ) <p> Poly-fil Stuffing 12oz ( o r see amount requirements for different projects on the package ! ) <p> Low-temp hot glue gun + extra glue sticks <p> Sharp scissors or ideally a fabric shears <p> A sharpie to draw your cloud shape <p> There is no distinct pattern for this project . I completely winged it and you can too ! <h> Method : <p> On a clean , flat surface fold your fabric in half and freehand draw a simple cloud shape on your fabric . If drawing is not your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick google search <p> Once you 're happy with the shape , cut it out ( both sides ) <p> Since the sides you have cut may have sharpie marks showing then make sure you glue this side up ! Make sure both pieces line up and apply a thin , clean line of glue around the edge . Carefully glue edge to edge in small stages 4/5ths of the way around <p> Do n't  forget to stop , you have to leave a hole for filling ! <p> When the glue is dry and you 're happy there 's no missed spots ie , holes , then turn it inside out . The reason for a thin , evenly glued edge is to avoid puckering . It may still appear puckered in spots but you can iron those out ! <p> Start stuffing the pillow carefully , ensuring its totally filled ! It may take a lot depending on how large you made it . Work out the bumps as you go . <p> The trickiest part is sealing the last gap since the fabric is now the right way around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possibly . Rushing will result in hot glue all over your hands and the outside of the pillow ! <p> Last year I did n't  have a Christmas wreath on our sad little front door but this year in our new house with a beautiful entryway there was no way I could go without ! Wreaths out there were either too expensive for me , too big , too small or justmeh . So I made my own which I love because nobody else has one . I 'm feeling festive so I guess I will share with you guys = <p> I purchased a plain artificial wreath but you could also use a fresh one ! Once I fluffed up the wreath and gave it a good shape , I sprayed on snow , topped with a large burlap bow and added the CUTEST pair of ice skates in the center . Vintage holiday decor is my favorite and I have been eyeing them up at Hobby Lobby since last year . When I found them again I could n't bear to leave them behind . I do n't  really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect solution ! <p> I do n't  need to tell you that babies are expensive little beings . It is rather overwhelming looking around your home and realizing just how much you need to buy for baby . I think the worst kind of baby gear is the stuff that lasts five minutes and is then no longer of any use . Like a bassinet or a changing table . <p> I was lucky to have an old TV cabinet sitting in my garage that had the perfect potential for a changing unit . This was achieved by simply changing the color ! I was able to create a beautiful piece of furniture for the nursery that can be used as both a changing table and later , a storage unit . What I love about re-purposing a small cabinet is the versatility of the end result . You could remove the doors and add decorative storage boxes to make it more gender/theme specific or you can also choose to- keep the doors and hide boring necessities behind them . <p> I am doing the latter . I have decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The upper shelf which is usually for DVD players , game consoles and the like will be a place to store basics like onesies/bibs/burp cloths and the inevitable spare outfits we will need with some changes ! Behind the doors there is one shelf which will be home to endless diapers , wipes and also health and bath products . All I am really adding to this piece is a standard changing pad . <p> For such a huge transformation and total re-purpose , this project is the easiest I have ever done . It had two steps . <p> I have two words people . CHALK . PAINT . <p> Paint that magic potion directly onto your dust-free , un-sanded wood and watch it transform ! Granted , it took four or five coats but if you are not in a rush and have patience then you can get away without prepping . I underestimated how many coats it would need and I went through two tubs before I gave in and bought a bigger one to finish it . If in doubt , buy the bigger tin ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prep the furniture from the start . The reason I did n't  was because I began during Summer and therefore in the height of my allergy season . It just was n't worth the agony in my eyes and the sneezing fits ! Once you are happy with the coverage you can use a clear wax to seal and protect it . <p> I 'm SO happy with the way this unit turned out and even happier that I have a piece of nursery furniture that cost me $25 ! All I purchased was the paint , wax and door knobs = <p> If you ca n't stand people who love Christmas , LOOK AWAY NOW because today I am bringing you some DIY Christmas wall art ! <p> Move over Fall , Halloween and Thanksgiving , its officially my time ! I 'm not obnoxious about it . I wont decorate for a while and blast carols from my speakers but I ADORE Christmas . I find it amusing how genuinely disgruntled many people become when others get in the Christmas spirit . You do n't  see me pitchin a fit when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can have Halloween decor in stores in July but now I 'm the worst for loving Christmas 8 weeks in advance ? As they say in the South , bless your heart ! <p> Christmas was always a special time for me and since moving away from home its become even more . It was incredibly difficult last year to spend my first Christmas in 27 years away from home . It was even harder to participate in others traditions that just did not feel right to me . Overall it was just a really emotional and sad time for me . I feel very strongly about carrying on my own Holiday traditions especially now that we are expecting . I cant wait to have Santa Claus again in our home and the magic of Christmas that only children can bring ! <p> So since November is just one sleep away I am sharing with you a super easy festive wall art I made over the weekend . This involves nothing but glue and some craft paint ! You know me , I like the easy stuff ! <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago at the craft store and separately , this laser cut decoration . There was no real plan for either and placing them haphazardly on the counter resulted in this project ! I decided to paint the cut-out gold + gold glitter top coat and attach it to the pallet . It makes a great piece of wall art that is simple yet festive ! Remember you can also stain or paint an unfinished pallet very easily if you cant find or do n't  want a distressed look . <p> First I left it painted gold with the leaf element glittered only but I loved the sparkle so much , I did the whole thing ! Its not overly glittery just a gorgeous shimmer than catches the light . <p> There are so many spooky Halloween wreaths out there but frankly , I think the price tags are equally as frightful . I am a huge fan of Fall decor and do n't  even start me on Christmas but my Halloween decorating is minimal at best . I cant justify having a huge amount of decorations for just one night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day as well ) . So I took things into my own hands using Michaels 40% off one full priced item coupon and made this MINDLESSLY easy , spider web wreath which ended up costing just $7 ! <p> You will need just three items : <p> Plain , twig wreath ( whatever size you want ! ) <p> Spider Web <p> Spiders , of course ! <p> Depending on where you are placing this and what the weather is like in your neck of the woods , you may need to use wire or glue to secure your spiders . Due to the family of geckos that likes to move into all my front door wreaths and then try jump into my house , I will probably use this indoors as wall decor ! If you are displaying the wreath inside then those spider legs pretty much secure themselves between the twigs . One less step score ! <p> Obviously these wreaths are supposed to be round ( duh ! ) but they are inexpensive and all vary . Choose wisely at the store . When you are ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide what point will be the top ( where it will sit on the door hanger/nail ) . <p> After this you get to play with your webbing . I used a very small amount , stretching it to the max to ensure it looked more real . The more you use , the clumpier it will be . I wound the web around one side , spending time making it look as true to life as I could . You could also arrange it width ways across the bottom half or indeed , all over the entire wreath . <p> Next up spiders ! Sparkly , plastic spiders are much more acceptable than live , hairy ones . This pack had six in it but I used just four . Again , depending on your wreath size , its up to you . You 're all set ! Did I mention this was TOO easy ? ! <p> Succulents do n't  ask for much making them a beginners favorite . Most varieties can be planted in small containers and because of this you can be as creative as you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted them in teacups , terrariums , regular clay pots and even shallow dishes . Here is a roundup of some really unique succulent arrangements and planter ideas . Hopefully you will be inspired to come up with something just as wacky and wonderful ! <h> Share this : <p> Who loves cinnamon rolls ? I do ! Ive been known to eat a whole pan . Not that I condone that sort of behavior ! I realized that I had n't  baked any cupcakes in a long time and as I was humming and hawing over what flavor I was craving , I saw a tube of Pillsbury Cinnamon Rolls in the fridge ( yes , I cheat sometimes ! ) and my mind was made up ! <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358 
@@48796285 @2296285/ <p> Surviving St. Patricks Day in Ireland is one thing . Surviving it in America when you 're Irish , is another ! Put on your best smile and your pointiest elbows and be prepared for an obnoxiously green , semi-racially offensive grand ol time ! I kid of course . Kind of . <p> On March 17th , the whole world seems to honor the Irish famous landmarks go green , parades are held and guinness flows more freely than usual . However , as far as parties go , America wins . You wo n't meet one American on St. Patricks Day whose Dads cousins husbands sisters mail man was Irish and therefore so are they . <h> Surviving St. Patricks Day in America <h> I-rish I Were IRISH <p> My husband always has a new anecdote for me and it cracks me up ! Now and again at his workplace my nationality will come up and the response has more than once been , " Oh really ? I 'm Irish too ! Where is she from ? ! " Now this would be a perfectly acceptable question if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , multiple people have now asked WHAT STATE I am from . Heres what 's wrong , Americans now claim Irish heritage so haphazardly that being Irish no longer means from the country . Its just a generic label and it can simply mean , Ohio . I 'm currently working my way through all fifty States in response . <h> BEGORRAH , BEGOSH , TOP O THE MORNIN <p> and all those other words and phrases that Irish people quite literally never say . They will be repeatedly shouted in your face if your nationality has been exposed . My personal tip for dealing with this is the Carlsberg response of " ci+nas , bothar , cail+n , bainne " . Irish people will know that in our native tongue this means nothing more than " silence , road , girl , milk " a collection of random words . Youve got to give the people what they want ! Tell them it means " you 've never met a nicer person " and be on your merry way . <h> DRUNKEN TOMFOOLERY <p> It sounds like a guys name ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) but in fact its the theme of the day . This is the more offensive aspect of the day for me . A lot of people in the US and beyond view drunken debauchery as the ONLY mark of a true Irishman . Mimic my accent and use stereotypical Irish-isms its fine . I do n't  take it personally because frankly I know a lot of these people genuinely like Ireland , the culture and the accent . They mean no real harm . But hearing that I 'm Irish and responding with a drunk related quip then I 'm going to get real mad , real fast ! Sometimes I like a drink . Sometimes I do n't  like a drink . Contrary to popular belief , holding an Irish passport does n't  mean I binge drink regularly and have Jameson flowing through my veins . <p> Again through my dear husband this wretched stereotype has reached me again and again . Sometimes directly to my face . Its taken me a while but I 've managed to perfect a smile that is much less psychotic than my first few attempts.If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . <p> There I am among a group of people ( all enjoying a quiet drink ) and my friend is asked what she 's drinking , she replies with the name of her cocktail and then Im asked by the same person . I tell this person what 's in my glass and the response is " of course you 're drinking , you 're Irish " . Now should I be mad at that comment or that my friend seemed to be able to enjoy her drink with no rude comment attached at all ? I will stress again that I do n't  really take this one too personally but I DO feel awfully self-conscious every time I take a sip of my drink after such a comment . <p> I will leave my feelings on a certain drink called the Irish Car Bomb " completely out of this post ! <p> If you 're looking for something to remind you of Ireland please let it be beautiful scenery , ancient history or scholarly achievements , not excessive alcohol consumption ! <h> GREEN <p> All shades of it and all at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and drinking it . <p> Last year I attended the parade in Downtown Savannah , the second largest St. Patricks Day parade in the world . That epic thing was almost 4 hours long . It was a sight to behold and probably my best St. Patricks Day ever ! I have never seen so much GREEN ! I probably should n't tell you that practically nobody in Ireland with the exception of small kids will wear green on March 17th ! But when in Romewear all the green you can ? <p> Remember to keep it clean people , weve already established the penchant for assuming were a nation of drunks but at kid friendly parades its probably best to keep your explicit t-shirts in the closet at home ! <h> PATTY , THE FORGOTTEN SISTER OF PATRICK <p> At least , that must be who she is because no Irishman is called Patty . Patty is short for Patricia , Paddy is short for Patrick . Those are the rules . " But there 's no T , it makes no sense ! " I hear you cry ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hence the Paddy . <p> Men called Patrick may be known as Pa , Pat , Paddy , Pod , Pawd , Pauric , Padraig the list goes on . But never Patty . I repeat NEVER PATTY ! <p> This sign was posted by Dublin Airport last year and I think its hilarious ! <p> " Please share this simple message with your friends and relations in the United States and Canada . Using the power of your network , hopefully we can banish the scourge of St Patty once and for all . Dublin Airport " <p> Every time you utter the phrase , St. Pattys Day a tiny leprechaun dies . True Story . You do n't  want that on you , do you ? ! <p> Keep it real , protect the leprechauns . They 're dying out like the Irish language . <h> PINCH THIS <p> I do n't  know where the heck that came from but I 'm sensing its an American invention since as I said , Irish people do n't  generally take part in greening their attire . The story goes if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder that leprechauns will pinch you for the same reason . Fortunately , youve all said Patty so much the leprechauns have suffered a massive decrease in population and wont be around to cause any pinch pains . <h> SHAMROCK NOT- FOUR LEAFED CLOVER <p> Shamrock was used to symbolize Christianity in Ireland and is an unofficial national symbol . Its not to be confused with the Harp which is our official national emblem and also not to be confused with a four leafed clover . Shamrock is a common three leafed clover , the four leafed version is said to be lucky because its harder to find. - The three leaves of the shamrock were used to symbolize the Holy Trinity by St. Patrick . On March 17th , people typically pin a small bunch of shamrock on their lapel or hat . Some do n't  know the meaning of small . <p> All jokes aside , America made St. Patricks Day what it is today and like anything they do , they attack it with gusto ! We all must grit our teeth- and roll our eyes deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would change ( except Patty stop that ! ) about Irish America and the festivities of St. Patricks Day here . The relationship between our nations throughout history has been strong and continues to be . No matter where I go in the US , people have nothing but positive words and funny stories to tell about their travels to my homeland . <p> Since I ca n't be in Ireland , America is the only other place I 'd rather be ! <p> Since I was 11 years old I have been a HUGE Harry Potter fan ( who is n't ? ) . I thought it was the coolest thing to be the same age as Harry each year he returned to Hogwarts to Hagrid , Dumbledore and the crew . I never thought I would get to experience the excitement of waiting for another book to be released again . With the glorious arrival of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and an ode to Harrys birthday , I 've been re-reading the series and watching the movies ! <p> Harry Potter may be about the wizarding world but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I enjoyed HP so much growing up that I am saddened for kids who have n't read the books and experienced the institution that is the world of Harry Potter . <p> While reading I am falling in love with the characters , the relationships and the magical world all over again . What strikes me most throughout all the dialogue are the stellar quotes of Albus Dumbledore , beloved headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry . <p> Its funny how small actions or simple statements provoke such long-winded thoughts . Or maybe its just me . I truly believe in the existence of empaths , although some skeptical folk will scoff at the idea . I feel deeply . I am very sensitive to people , situations and when something feels off I can usually instantly come to the conclusion why , even if on the surface there does n't  seem to be an obvious answer . Its borderline psychic sometimes and that in itself can be unsettling . <p> I recently trudged through US Pre-clearance ( a wonderful affair where you clear immigration before entering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard- questions I was asked had me thinking for a large portion of my 9 hour flight . <h> " Maam did you carry your own bag today ? " <p> I did carry my bag , of course . I did n't  need to be reminded of the huge bulky monstrosity I had just lugged through check in . In the past five years I 've carried my fair share of heavy bags and I 'm now aware that I have carried them mentally too which led me to think about how much weight on my shoulders could I drop off and not worry about ? <p> Being empathetic involves a lot of worry and 80% of it never seems to be my own . I carry burdens for people who do n't  seem to care about what they probably should care about . I carry burdens for friends and family suffering . I carry burdens for strangers I see on the news in sad or dangerous situations . So how do I prioritize my own ? <p> As someone extremely perceptive and introverted , I dislike nothing more than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept . Sensitivity creates connection and intimacy . Sensitivity allows for compassion and understanding . Sensitivity is a wide open channel for love . It does n't  mean thin skin . It means deep strength but somewhere along the line we were all told its a pathetic sign of weakness . What I consider weak are those who run from problems . Those who abandon instead of stand up and care for someone . Those who allow a loved one to carry their problems while they shamelessly continue on their carefree path . Weak are those who laugh in the face of sensitivity and take advantage of it . <p> Ive been through enough to want to give up a thousand times . Some days , I still want to but my empathy for others wont allow it . I guess empathy is stubborns over sensitive sister . <p> When something comes natural to you , its hard to deliberately stop doing it . For me , it is natural to worry for others and stress over things that are not mine to be concerned with . But who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy I give to others and look out for myself ? Everyone desires to be supported . There 's great confidence in being enveloped by unconditional support but its not always an option . Sometimes you have to be enough by yourself . <p> I implore those of you out there sinking under the weight of others baggage to she 'd that load and prioritize yourself . Especially if what you are carrying goes entirely unrecognized . For your health and your happiness , lay down the baggage and carry yourself . <p> Did you ever notice that the people who have grand plans for reform on New Years Eve every year are the same people who also take to your timeline every Monday morning to whine and complain about what a dreadful day it is ? Curiouser and curiouser ! No ? <p> Other than being perfectly drained by the hatred of Mondays I got to thinking about why people hold one day in every 365 in such high esteem but cant seem to recognize the first day of a new week as a similar new leaf/fresh start and all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must admit . I harbor a terrible secret <h> I LOVE MONDAYS ! <p> I do n't  have time to dwell on how miserable Mondays are instead , I 'm wishing they had more than 24 hours . I get up at the crack of dawn and I struggle to get everything done by midnight ! Its the day I brainstorm for the blog , write a few posts , create my images and think about what I can do at the weekend . <p> I 'm not sure anymore if a large portion of the public just really dislikes Monday or if yet again social media has created a nice little bandwagon to jump aboard ! I 'm going to go with the bandwagon on this one as thinking about such a high level of negativity from countless people , week after week is frighteningly overwhelming ! Just HOW is it that bad ? <p> Monday is a blanket of fresh snow , a mirror still lake , a brand new journal all yours to disturb . Why not make the disturbance worthwhile ? <h> How To Get Through Monday <p> Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put your positive pants on and set the tone for a brand new week . <p> In the space where you usually voice your dismay , write down a goal for the day or the week . <p> Hustle to make it happen . <p> Instead of the usual coffee you need to survive , try a cup of positivity . If that does n't  work then I know another cup you might enjoy . <p> Handle it . You 're a grown a** adult . <p> And if you cant do any of that then close your mouth and make Tuesday a better day ! <p> Before I met my husband I liked to think I was relatively in tune with who I was as a person . Fun fact : I was n't . At all . <p> Marrying the military ( because let 's face it , your relationship with the Army ends up being more demanding than the relationship with your spouse ) taught me a lot about myself and better still , inspired me take a good hard look at my weaknesses and change a little . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes his spots " , " once a . , always a . " and all those other bitter , overused phrases . Well I call BS on that . I think people are so conditioned into thinking that change or personal growth is beyond the realm of attainability that they have become utterly relentless in their views . Well sorry Mr. Pessimist but personal growth is a realistic and achievable concept ! If were the first to point out someone changing in a negative sense , why cant we acknowledge the positive ? <h> 5 Ways Military Life Changes You <h> Flexibility <p> Are you someone like me who likes to have a plan ? You are ? Great . Well forget it . In the military its almost impossible to plan the time you can sit down to dinner let alone a date or a trip away . All this is dependent on your significant others particular- job of course but in this life flexibility is a must . Having a vision of what you want to do is fine but carefully executed plans rarely come to fruition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat of their pants and are perfectly fine living day to day . I , however , like to plan things to a tee and unfortunately to cope with this , it is often best for me to fear the worst case scenario rather than feel deflated , daily . Its not everyones cup of tea and probably not the healthiest coping mechanism but I 've found myself a lot less disappointed and better again , a lot less angry . <h> Adaptability <p> If your service member is a lifer ( 20+ year military career ) then it is a given that you will probably move tens of times throughout your marriage . No mean feat ! Even if you are associated with the military for a short time then the chances of living in three or four different places is realistic . Moving so often is NOT easy , aside from the usual moving headaches it creates obstacles concerning the education of your children , the length of your career ( or if you 'll even be able to have one ) , the quality of- your relationships to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pack up and move your life in a very short time period and there 's also the possibility of a short-notice deployment in which you very suddenly find yourself spouse-less and/or a single mother for many months . <h> Strength <p> Its pretty obvious from what Ive mentioned above that being strong is n't a choice in the military . Its an absolute necessity . <p> Were all human though . Do we have ridiculous moments of weakness where we cry in our driveways- because its late at night , the dog has stepped in his own poop and is so terrified of the hose you 're trying to wash his paw with so unsuccessfully that you then think he s choking because you 're pulling so hard on his collar to get him to STAY STILLLLLLLL and you only have two hands ? <p> Yes that happens . Or so someone told me . <h> Gratitude <p> The harder my life has become as a result of being involved with the military , the greater the appreciation I have for everything , really. - My surroundings , my family , my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have like my own home and the ability to travel extensively . It changes your view of what matters . Being grateful for the smallest things is a blessing that comes from the darker moments when you feel the worst you ever have in your whole life . <h> Knowing What 's Important <p> None of us are invincible , this we know but military life is sobering . The value of supportive family and friends is a lesson learned immediately . Most people on any military installation are nowhere near their families and so friends become just as important . Not having a support system nearby is extremely tough and the friends you will make along your military journey can be friends for life . On the other hand , military towns can be some of the trashiest and most dramatic places you will find yourself . Unless you 're that way inclined , stay out of this . It will do nothing for your happiness and you wo n't find friends or genuine support in these people . I highly recommend making new friends but thread carefully until you 're comfortable trusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly changes you . I simultaneously love and hate every second of this journey but if given the choice , I would n't change a thing . It truly is the making of who I am . <p> We 've all experienced boredom . Common symptoms include a distinct jittery restlessness combined with mind numbing emptiness and a hint of whining ; <h> " IM SO BORED ! " <p> I am guilty of it . We all are . However after emigrating and spending an abundance of time alone I can safely say that boredom is no longer an element in my life . Sound counter-intuitive ? You see the longer I spend by myself , the more time I have to practice mindfulness and be present . A lesson so valuable to me that learning the hard way has been worth every monotonous second . It is so easy to be completely absorbed in every facet of our lives and yet not be present in any of it . Selective hearing , selective seeing in some cases and total ingratitude all contribute to wonderful things in our lives just breezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . <p> It has taken me years ( far too many years ) to realize that a great deal of my time ( and my mind ) was preoccupied with other people . Not actually with people but thinking about them . Thinking about what they thought of me . Thinking about what they were saying about me . Worrying about all of the above . Crazy right ? It drove me to retreat from large group situations , preferring the company of just one or two friends . Over time it became even more isolated than that and gradually descended into a bleak and boring existence . Something had to change but pulling yourself out of a rut is easier said than done . That 's the thing about ruts they become pretty comfortable . <p> That 's where my lesser known friend gratitude showed up . There is n't much more terrifying than reaching a certain age and your to-do list you made years ago for that age has n't  been ticked off . In the face of adversity you can sit down and descend into depression , dwelling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be grateful for everything you DO have . Life , alone , being one . Every day I started to see more . Really see and acknowledge the things in my life that made it more than enough . <p> Its hard today to recognize enough . Its next to impossible . We have so much and crave even more . Convenient everything has been detrimental to our work ethic . Simply put , we have to do very little to get most of the things we desire . Yet here we are , bored . <h> Boredom is an absurdity . <p> Boredom is nothing more than ingratitude with a whiny voice . In this life boredom is not an option . It is a state of mind wherein you have chosen defeat . <p> How much of the world have you traveled ? How many of the worlds almost 130,000,000 published books have you read ? How many people have you reached out to lately ? How many miles have you walked ? How many photographs have you looked over ? Need I go on ? Boredom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of contentment , open mindedness and gratitude . <p> Loneliness sucks , feeling deflated sucks and even the feeling of rejection is all too real . These are the moments that are your cue to be gentle with yourself . Do something selfishly and unapologetically FOR YOU . Just please do n't  choose boredom ! <p> Ah , the comfort zone . That safe place where the only feelings you feel are warm and fuzzy . If you suddenly find yourself married to a service member you will know that your comfort zone is all but a distant memory . A place , that once in your life was a certainty until you became a military spouse . <p> I grew up in Ireland , totally ignorant to the culture that comes with a large scale military . When I met my husband , I saw him as any other normal guy but it did n't  take me long to realize that as well as the cultural differences associated with our places of birth I was also dunked without warning into the vastly complicated world of the US Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overwhelming Aspects Of Military Life For The New Military Spouse <h> Equipment <p> Your childhood garage once housed tools and bicycles but yours now contains tough boxes and over-flowing rucksacks stacked to the ceiling . <p> His closet is filled with dress uniforms , covers , camouflage uniforms , tan t-shirts , PTs and huge muddy boots . Then he comes home and announces that there 's a new uniform coming out . Enter more of the above and expect to find the old stuff crammed into every spare space in your home/garage . <p> There 's a box somewhere that should be full of name tapes , patches , awards and the ruler to make sure his dress uniform meets regulation . That darn ruler is always missing . <h> Terminology <p> Hell text you to say that he " has to do a brief at the Motor Pool with the CSM at sixteen hundred " . WHAT ? Or life changing conversations like " After he attends CCC you will PCS to Fort X to take command " . Again , WHAT ? <p> I mustve been with my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he even does all day . ( I have since found out , sort of ! ) <p> The terminology is difficult to get used to but I assure you , you will learn . Have patience ( both of you ! ) , it takes time . Ask your partner to explain the acronyms , rank and general structure of the military . There 's an awful lot but its not to difficult to understand . See it as an opportunity to learn a new language of sorts . <h> Rank <p> This one comes back to the structure . There 's a basic split : Enlisted and Officers and within each of them are many different ranks . Learn about the ranks and their symbols here . Like with anything in the Army there are certain rules attached with who can be associated with who , socially . Fortunately for spouses there is no rank ! <h> Etiquette <p> Whether its stopping what you are doing ( to include driving ) to face the flag at retreat , walking on his left side while in uniform to allow him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uniform all military spouses should be familiar with the dos and donts of military etiquette . <h> Deployments <p> The word all military families fear most , deployment . Anywhere from a few months to a year , your spouse could be deployed oversees and you will be left to take the reins on everything . He could miss birthdays , holidays and even the birth of babies . Unfortunately its a real and present part of being an active-duty service member . Read about our long distance story , here . There are many resources online that serve as guides and support for coping with deployment . I personally like Jo , My Gosh ! blog . <h> Secrets <p> We all know that the key to a good marriage is honesty and communication . Unfortunately in the military , your significant other may not be able to share everything about his job with you . This can be frustrating . Do n't  take it personally he probably feels immense pressure just from not being able to tell you . <h> Sacrifices <p> He makes many just by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy will you make sacrifices ! You first give up your home and family to be by your S/Os side and more often than not you will also give up your own career in order to move around . Of course it is n't the end of your career if you do n't  want it to be . Many military spouses own their own portable businesses and many are homemakers and home schoolers . The list and opportunities are endless . It is entirely up to you . For someone like me with a mechanical engineering degree , it is difficult to manage a full-time career when your location is so disposable . Were all just figuring it out ! <h> Making Plans <p> To put abruptly you do n't  ! Plans are for missions . Your home life however , tends to be up in the air until the last minute . Military life changes as quickly as the Irish weather ! Learning to be a little more spontaneous will do wonders for your sanity . <h> Difficult People <p> Difficult people are everywhere . Not just in military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some more derogatory than others . Gossip and drama persists at a rampant pace . Toxic people do n't  belong in your life . Steer clear of people who exist only to make others lives miserable . This is not a community in which we should tear one another down . Support is key among military spouses and contrary to some stories you might hear , you will make some of the best friends you will ever meet on your military journey . <h> Realizing How Strong You Are <p> I do n't  give myself enough credit for how strong I am in this whirlwind life . Nor do other friends I know . It is probably because half the time you are on the verge of tears , biting your lip to stop from FREAKING OUT about the latest piece of information he has brought home . Its hard to feel strong when you 're drained inside from wondering how you 'll cope the next time he leaves . But when he does , you surprise yourself with how much of a bad a** you are ! <p> The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your comfort zone makes you realize what a resilient and resourceful , strong person you truly are ! <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358

Time has flown by and it has truly surprised me how fleeting these moments really are. - Its hard to believe I am in the final weeks of this pregnancy single digits now ! <p> I swore at the beginning I would take a weekly bump photo and it saddens me that I did n't  . I was either too busy , feeling too gross or just forgot until I was already into another week . During the first 16 weeks , there was no bump to photograph anyway ! Personally , I like to read about what different women experience at different stages . No two pregnancies are the same but it can be comforting to know what you could expect or even just know you are n't  alone in what you are experiencing. - Now that I have officially entered the third trimester , I have decided to post a little update . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A cantaloupe according to my app ! Baby weighs over 3.5 lbs <h> Total weight gain <p> 18 lbs <h> Maternity clothes <p> Over-the-bump jeans ( H&amp;M Mama maternity skinny jeans are LIFE ! They are super affordable too and often on sale. ) since week 16 and some maternity tops since week 25 although most werent necessary they were just cute . I still have many wearable non-maternity tops . All my leggings are my pre-pregnancy ones . <h> Stretch marks <p> None , yet but the itchiest skin &gt;. &lt; <h> Sleep <p> Theres three scenarios here : <p> If I can get to sleep at a decent hour , I am out until baby uses my bladder as a punching bag . Which is usually about 1000 times a night . In this case I usually get back to sleep . <p> I get to sleep after midnight but then sleep through until the early morning . <h> Longing for <p> To nest . All day every day . I have an insatiable desire to organize ALL THE THINGS ! <p> A somewhat comfortable sleep position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots and lots . Its always a party in there . Mostly early in the morning , late afternoon and around 10pm . Now that baby is getting a bit cramped in there , the movements are lessviolent ! <h> Cravings <p> Nothing odd and nothing in particular ! If I had to say anything I would say cinnamon rolls . But you do n't  need to be pregnant to want those all the time . <h> Nausea <p> Some occasional morning weakness before breakfast . Since I was so sick in the first trimester I figure it will strike again somewhere in the third . <h> Gender <p> Waiting for baby to reveal all ! <h> Symptoms <p> Indigestion after most foods but not so much heartburn , difficulty sleeping , back ache , fatigue , general lack of motivation to do anything and although my bump is small the beginning of a very attractive waddle . <h> Belly button in or out ? <p> A weird , neither in nor out at the moment and it freaks me out so much . <h> Wedding rings on or off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days they do n't  want to come off . <h> Happy or moody most of the time <p> Both . Predominantly moody though .

@@48796288 @2296288/ <p> I was always aware that babies are expensive little beings but I quickly realized just how expensive . It was an eye-opening experience setting up for baby ! I am so grateful to our families for gifting us the big ticket items like the stroller , car seat , crib etc . Between those gifts , re-purposing furniture , building our own ( thanks husband ) and my own frugality we have managed to set up for baby at a fraction of the real cost . Hopefully this post will give you an eye for a great baby bargain just like I found in many stores . <p> I am not in any way stingy . In fact , I have champagne taste but live with a sparkling water budget . I would definitely call myself frugal . I shop around A LOT and a nose around Goodwill is not beneath me , especially when they carry department store overstock ( OMG ! ) . My favorite stores for great deals are Home Goods , TJ Maxx and- sometimes , one particular Ross near my home . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat but its often luck of the draw with what bargain they may have in stock on the day you 're visiting . This is the perfect excuse to go often ! <h> Where To Find The Best Baby Bargain <h> Goodwill <p> A year ago I walked into my local Goodwill ( my first Goodwill trip ever ) and quickly turned my nose up . I actually said EW . Fast forward to 2016 and while doing a donation drop-off at a brand new store , I gave it another chance and wandered into the baby clothes section . I am hooked ever since ! <p> It hit me pretty quickly that bang in the middle of 4 different Goodwill stores in my locale are two Army installations . Army posts mean families moving in and out of the area constantly . This in turn means families purging their unwanted items often . The presence of military families also means there 's lots of babies around . While many , many adult garments at Goodwill may be ratty and suspect , the baby clothes are in a league of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased a hoard of completely unworn or worn-once onesies and full outfits . My total is usually under $6 and I come away with 6-8 outfits . <p> Honestly , I often feel guilty buying at Goodwill . I feel like I am stealing the eyes out of someones head . They have a color-of-the-week offer which means that if you have a bunch of items on your arm bearing that color plastic barb , then that item is half price . In the infant section , this means your outfit could cost you just 49- ! On Sundays , ALL items with the color-of-the-week tag are 50- . <p> Some of my Goodwill gold includes <p> Enough adorable infant clothing to dress every baby in North America . I will re-donate any items I do n't  end up using . Brands including Ralph Lauren , Tommy Hilfiger , GAP , Janie &amp; Jack , OshKosh , Little Me , Carters and more ( 49-99- per item ) <p> V-Tech Light &amp; Move Learning Ball- that has been thoroughly disinfected and is like brand new ( $1.99 -versus- $14.99 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip on stroller book with a tag on . Both washed like a dream ( 39- each -versus $7-10 ) <h> TJ Maxx <p> Ok , while TJ is one of my favorite stores , it can be as hit and miss as Goodwill . Their inventory changes constantly so if you spot something you have to snap it up there and then . I promise you it wont be there next week , or even later that day . I have found so many baby items at a fraction of the cost and though most of their stock is passed season or slightly flawed , some of what I got is still this current seasons styles and prints . Have a good look at something you like in case it is damaged ( it probably is n't ) and put it in your cart pronto ! Sometimes the flaw and reason an item is there is a tiny as a seam sewn off center . If you are n't  fussy , you will never even notice . <h> Marshalls <p> At Marshalls you will find similar things to TJ or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need at one , be sure to check the other . <h> Ross <p> I do n't  shop here very often . In fact I have purchased something from a Ross store only twice . This past weekend I was looking for something specific so I perused my local and nicest Ross ! I did n't  buy one because I have one already but they had Boppy Nursing pillows for $24 ! Granted , it was n't the cutest slipcover they make but those bad boys retail for $39.99 ! <p> I did buy a large faux sheepskin area rug for babys room for $30 versus the $60+ Ive seen elsewhere ! <h> Home Goods <p> I LOVE Home Goods . This place is the dream for kitting out babys room for a bargain . With goods much like Marshalls and TJ Maxx but with a focus on the decor side of things , obviously . Some of my finds include ; <p> More hangers ! <p> Storage boxes/Laundry Hamper ( $4-25 -versus- $15-50+ ) <p> Diaper caddies ( $6-12 -versus- $20+ ) <p> Clip on musical crib nightlight/soother ( $6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <h> Amazon <p> Amazon may not be a discount store per se but as I am a Prime member it has been worth every cent . As a Prime member I qualify for free two-day shipping , unlimited free TV/movie streaming , unlimited photo storage , access to Prime Pantry ( groceries on your door step ? Yes please ! ) and more . <p> As a Prime member you are also eligible to become a member of Amazon Family . You can make an Amazon Baby Registry and qualify for a FREE welcome box choc full of baby items and free samples/coupons . As well as this you will receive 15% off an item of your choice on your registry and a number of other offers including a free Kindle e-book and discounted clothing . <p> For me , the best part about Amazon Prime are the subscription options . When you subscribe to diapers ( you choose the frequency of their delivery ) you get 20% off and a $2 off coupon on your first delivery . If you subscribe to a total of 5 items at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The bargain price of sub $25 for 200+ diapers and peace of mind that they will arrive on my doorstep in 48 hours is especially worth it to me . I subscribe to dog food , baby wipes and other personal items which means I never have to remember them on my weekly grocery shop . <p> I am so happy with my baby bargain stockpile as I get such a kick out of having exactly what I wanted and still having a little extra cash in my purse ! Off the top of my head , there is over $500 of savings just from the items I have listed ( I have n't listed every single item I have purchased on this journey ! ) including the retail value of the baby clothing from Goodwill . <p> Amazon is the best for a registry since you can get so much covered under their completion discount ! I also saved buying second hand from a store near us called Once Upon a Child its a little nicer than your standard goodwill . Great tips I also loved TJ Maxx for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Kohls Sale Racks ! ! You have to go early and often sometimes its a bust , other times I walk away with TONS of stuff ! Also Old Navys kids section is AWESOME ! And they have tons of sale items there too !

@@48796290 @2296290/ <p> Its funny how small actions or simple statements provoke such long-winded thoughts . Or maybe its just me . I truly believe in the existence of empaths , although some skeptical folk will scoff at the idea . I feel deeply . I am very sensitive to people , situations and when something feels off I can usually instantly come to the conclusion why , even if on the surface there does n't  seem to be an obvious answer . Its borderline psychic sometimes and that in itself can be unsettling . <p> I recently trudged through US Pre-clearance ( a wonderful affair where you clear immigration before entering the US ! ) in Dublin airport and one of the standard- questions I was asked had me thinking for a large portion of my 9 hour flight . <h> " Maam did you carry your own bag today ? " <p> I did carry my bag , of course . I did n't  need to be reminded of the huge bulky monstrosity I had just lugged through check in . In the past five years I 've carried my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have carried them mentally too which led me to think about how much weight on my shoulders could I drop off and not worry about ? <p> Being empathetic involves a lot of worry and 80% of it never seems to be my own . I carry burdens for people who do n't  seem to care about what they probably should care about . I carry burdens for friends and family suffering . I carry burdens for strangers I see on the news in sad or dangerous situations . So how do I prioritize my own ? <p> As someone extremely perceptive and introverted , I dislike nothing more than to be labelled too sensitive . Sensitivity is not a dirty concept . Sensitivity creates connection and intimacy . Sensitivity allows for compassion and understanding . Sensitivity is a wide open channel for love . It does n't  mean thin skin . It means deep strength but somewhere along the line we were all told its a pathetic sign of weakness . What I consider weak are those who run from problems . Those who abandon instead of stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved one to carry their problems while they shamelessly continue on their carefree path . Weak are those who laugh in the face of sensitivity and take advantage of it . <p> Ive been through enough to want to give up a thousand times . Some days , I still want to but my empathy for others wont allow it . I guess empathy is stubborns over sensitive sister . <p> When something comes natural to you , its hard to deliberately stop doing it . For me , it is natural to worry for others and stress over things that are not mine to be concerned with . But who will worry for me ? Shouldnt I give myself the same courtesy I give to others and look out for myself ? Everyone desires to be supported . There 's great confidence in being enveloped by unconditional support but its not always an option . Sometimes you have to be enough by yourself . <p> I implore those of you out there sinking under the weight of others baggage to she 'd that load and prioritize yourself . Especially if what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your happiness , lay down the baggage and carry yourself . <p> When I first started blogging I did n't  even consider my niche . I just wrote about what I was doing , my current situation , things that were of interest to me at that time , etc . I quickly discovered that to promote and connect with fellow bloggers my blog needed to have some type of niche in order to reach like-minded bloggers . I struggled with this definition for the first month . I was Irish , newly married and recently emigrated to the US . I liked fashion , food and travel but did n't  want my blog to be categorized so narrowly under any of these things . Getting my head around that mish-mash of interests and circumstances was hard for me and I found it difficult to , as the saying now goes , find my tribe . I came to accept that my blog is a lifestyle blog that focuses on a healthy mix of all of the above . But what 's more important is that I stopped worrying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a billion articles online , all telling you the importance of sticking to your niche and while that is necessary in business , if you are blogging for fun then my response to that is , " who said so ? ! " <p> After publishing posts consistently and learning what my viewers liked the most I started to settle into my own blog and became more confident when hitting publish . I was never overly confident that the content was good but happy with what I was saying and HOW I was saying it . Although you strive to give your readers what they want , it is of the utmost importance to write what YOU want , too . Your viewers have come to your site because they like you and your content , they will return if they love it . If they leave , so be it . More will come . <p> As I said in my last post , I have seen people switch niches a lot . There 's many reasons for going beyond the limits of your niche . Perhaps you are after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to write about due to changes in life circumstances . For example , you had a travel blog but are now settling down into motherhood and want to focus on writing articles on parenting . Or you have been blogging about college life but are now entering the working world . There 's an array of reasons to re-brand your blog but there is NEVER a reason to not be true to yourself in your writing . <p> Which brings me back from my tangential rambling to the idea of writing in your voice . Of course I do n't  mean voice in the traditional sense- but the portrayal of your personality through the words you write . You are unique and your writing style should be too . If you are a really funny and bubbly person but write in a monotonous tone with none of the humor you possess naturally then your content will not be authentic . And although we live in a world where we can fake happiness , good fortune and popularity quite easily via social media , your blog will expose a greater portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life that is on show , honest . Writing is powerful and people are perceptive beings . Posts repeatedly written in any voice but your own will be transparent and shallow . Your readers will not trust you or your content and wont engage . <p> The first thing I notice when reading blog posts , or any piece of writing for that matter , is the writing style . Now I 'm not saying mine is good . I 'm a serial user of cliches and slang which is considered vulgarity and terrible writing by some ( or most ) . In the world of professional writing I would more than likely be be condemned ! I do strive to improve my writing skills and blogging refreshes a great deal of lessons already learned about writing but when it comes to writing posts I often skip the- rules and mechanics of composing the perfect piece of literature as I try to write them as an exact reflection of myself and what I might say in a discussion with a real life person ! The wit , sarcasm , humor whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people . That is who I am . I 'm sure there are people who like my posts , those who can take or leave them and others whod rather poke out their eyes than read to the bottom . I 'm totally ok with that ! Well I 'd prefer if you held onto your eyes but I 'm fine with you leaving . Not everyone shares the same interests and opinions . <p> The way that I write , is genuine . The feelings I express , are genuine . My sentiments when I comment on your posts , are genuine . Being a genuine person is what I respect the most in any human being . I have no time for any single trait that is a fraction less than honest . <p> When I borderline stalk every social media platform you use , I love your blog ! When I like your pictures , I genuinely like your pictures . When I share your content , I really do think you have a message worth sending out . I like all of these things about you because you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For those of you starting out , who maybe havent found your blogging voice yet , ask yourself before publishing is this for the glory of a spike in views , free products , money , etc. ? If the answer is yes to any of the above , then I suggest you save your draft and go back to the drawing board . <p> For those of you pouring your heart and soul into your blog and feeling like you need to start writing as someone else to fit in stop it ! Explore the boundaries of your niche , find new forums to join , freshen up your content but for the love of God , keep writing in your own voice ! <h> If you struggle with finding your voice , what is it about blogging that limits your authenticity ? <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358

@@48796292 @2296292/ <p> Do you struggle to keep your succulents alive ? Last Spring I posted Succulents for Beginners , a general beginners guide to planting and caring for your succulents . It was a big hit and I 'm so glad its been useful to tens of thousands of people . During the Summer I followed up with another post on how to propagate your plants . But I have left you hanging , succulovers and for that I apologize . Youve now purchased your succulents , chosen a whimsical planter and even learned how to propagate the clippings but what about the middle part ? How do you keep your succulents alive in the first place ? ! <p> This post may contain affiliate links <p> After a disastrous first round ( RIP ) I have managed to keep my second lot of succulents alive . That 's a year now despite quite frankly , sometimes forgetting they exist . Considering I kill every other other plant ( that is n't a cactus/succulent ) , I call that a victory . One of them even survived a near fatal Labradoodle munching attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 Key Steps To Keeping Indoor- Succulents Alive <p> Space . Avoid overcrowding . I 'm guilty of this , especially if I buy a pre-arranged dish garden . I later re-pot them if they begin to suffer . Your succulents need space to breathe and grow . There 's nothing stopping you planting multiple succs in one terrarium/container just make sure they are n't  on top of one another . Even succulents like personal space . <p> Light . Give them enough of it . Because succulents are hardy and need less watering than normal plants , people tend to think they do n't  need to be cared for in other areas either . Do n't  neglect your babies ! Succulents love light just not direct sunlight . Make sure they are positioned to get a few hours of light a day . If your plants do n't  get enough light theyll stretch toward the light and get leggy . This is a good time to propagate . <p> Temperature . Make sure they 're warm enoughand cool enough ! Succulents like to be warm in the Summer and cooler in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some air flow around your plants . An open window or where all else fails , an air vent . This helps with the draining/drying of the soil and you can keep track of their watering needs . <p> Watering . Do n't  over-water . Succulents only need to be watered when their soil is completely dry so check if the soil is still soggy before their next drink ! <p> Drainage . They love well draining , gritty soil . Ideally your container of choice needs to have a drainage hole so that the soil does n't  remain soggy and drown your succulents . <p> Food . Give them a treat ! Get a plant food made specifically for cacti &amp; succulents and feed them once in a while . <p> Species . Knowing which varieties you have and their specific needs is a good start to knowing how to keep them alive . <p> This blog has given me a serious case of craft-itis ! I get so much inspiration and motivation from reading hundreds of other blogs every month that I now have a massive craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried my hand at a simple cloud pillow for Babys nursery . I can not sew . At all . Even a button , it WILL fall off again . I despise sewing . What I can do however , is handle a small , low-temperature hot glue gun ! <p> People often ask me if I 've chosen a theme for Babys nursery and honestly I had not , nor had I ever considered one . Unless you can call gender neutral a theme . Although I love to decorate and sit back to admire my handiwork , I get bored and over analytical . For me , something overly specific was an absolute no-no . <p> Let me tell you , choosing gender neutral decor is easier said than done . It seems these days that a lot of grey and rustic/outdoorsy decor is considered gender neutral . I personally think that stuff , although beautiful , is far more boyish than girly . After I had decided on a white crib and re-purposed my old TV cabinet into a white changing unit ( check it out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Etsy . What 's both baby appropriate and gender neutral ? The sky ! So I settled on clouds , stars , the moon etc. as my central theme that is n't a theme . <p> This easy peasy no-sew cutie will be complete in 30 minutes and costs less than $10-20 depending on where you buy your supplies and the quality you desire ! <h> You will need : <p> White fabric ( cotton , felt , fleece , velour its up to you ! ) <p> Poly-fil Stuffing 12oz ( o r see amount requirements for different projects on the package ! ) <p> Low-temp hot glue gun + extra glue sticks <p> Sharp scissors or ideally a fabric shears <p> A sharpie to draw your cloud shape <p> There is no distinct pattern for this project . I completely winged it and you can too ! <h> Method : <p> On a clean , flat surface fold your fabric in half and freehand draw a simple cloud shape on your fabric . If drawing is not your forte then find a shape to copy or trace with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut it out ( both sides ) <p> Since the sides you have cut may have sharpie marks showing then make sure you glue this side up ! Make sure both pieces line up and apply a thin , clean line of glue around the edge . Carefully glue edge to edge in small stages 4/5ths of the way around <p> Do n't  forget to stop , you have to leave a hole for filling ! <p> When the glue is dry and you 're happy there 's no missed spots ie , holes , then turn it inside out . The reason for a thin , evenly glued edge is to avoid puckering . It may still appear puckered in spots but you can iron those out ! <p> Start stuffing the pillow carefully , ensuring its totally filled ! It may take a lot depending on how large you made it . Work out the bumps as you go . <p> The trickiest part is sealing the last gap since the fabric is now the right way around . Take your time and slowly glue it as neatly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hands and the outside of the pillow ! <p> Last year I did n't  have a Christmas wreath on our sad little front door but this year in our new house with a beautiful entryway there was no way I could go without ! Wreaths out there were either too expensive for me , too big , too small or justmeh . So I made my own which I love because nobody else has one . I 'm feeling festive so I guess I will share with you guys = <p> I purchased a plain artificial wreath but you could also use a fresh one ! Once I fluffed up the wreath and gave it a good shape , I sprayed on snow , topped with a large burlap bow and added the CUTEST pair of ice skates in the center . Vintage holiday decor is my favorite and I have been eyeing them up at Hobby Lobby since last year . When I found them again I could n't bear to leave them behind . I do n't  really have anywhere to hang more decorations so this was the perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas , LOOK AWAY NOW because today I am bringing you some DIY Christmas wall art ! <p> Move over Fall , Halloween and Thanksgiving , its officially my time ! I 'm not obnoxious about it . I wont decorate for a while and blast carols from my speakers but I ADORE Christmas . I find it amusing how genuinely disgruntled many people become when others get in the Christmas spirit . You do n't  see me pitchin a fit when you all go crazy for pumpkins in August so hush . We can have Halloween decor in stores in July but now I 'm the worst for loving Christmas 8 weeks in advance ? As they say in the South , bless your heart ! <p> Christmas was always a special time for me and since moving away from home its become even more . It was incredibly difficult last year to spend my first Christmas in 27 years away from home . It was even harder to participate in others traditions that just did not feel right to me . Overall it was just a really emotional and sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my own Holiday traditions especially now that we are expecting . I cant wait to have Santa Claus again in our home and the magic of Christmas that only children can bring ! <p> So since November is just one sleep away I am sharing with you a super easy festive wall art I made over the weekend . This involves nothing but glue and some craft paint ! You know me , I like the easy stuff ! <p> I picked up this distressed hanging pallet piece a few weeks ago at the craft store and separately , this laser cut decoration . There was no real plan for either and placing them haphazardly on the counter resulted in this project ! I decided to paint the cut-out gold + gold glitter top coat and attach it to the pallet . It makes a great piece of wall art that is simple yet festive ! Remember you can also stain or paint an unfinished pallet very easily if you cant find or do n't  want a distressed look . <p> First I left it painted gold with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , I did the whole thing ! Its not overly glittery just a gorgeous shimmer than catches the light . <p> Succulents do n't  ask for much making them a beginners favorite . Most varieties can be planted in small containers and because of this you can be as creative as you like when it comes to your planter of choice . I 've planted them in teacups , terrariums , regular clay pots and even shallow dishes . Here is a roundup of some really unique succulent arrangements and planter ideas . Hopefully you will be inspired to come up with something just as wacky and wonderful ! <p> My love of succulents is not a secret . It could n't possibly be , even if I tried . In Succulents for Beginners , I outlined how to plant a succulent and keep it alive . So be sure to check back there for the nitty gritty. - I was at a loss for where to plant my newest cactus ( Blue Candle Strawflower ) and crassula . A quick trip to the dollar store to buy a birthday balloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conundrum ! I picked up this large white coffee mug to serve as my succulent planter and some white stones to decorate . The plants cost around $3 the week prior so for a grand total of $5 I put together this little cactus garden , knocking the socks off the $15-20 pre-made counterparts ! <p> Since this mug has no drainage holes , I lined the bottom with a mixture of pea gravel and well draining soil . I then added some soil and planted the cactus . Those suckers will stab you so be careful to grip it in the right place ! Once I secured it in place I added the crassula , dispersed around the free space slightly . <p> You can add colorful sand , pebbles or moss to decorate the planter or leave it au natural . That 's the fun part and entirely up to you . You can plant these bad boys in virtually anything so be creative . I have a white container theme going on so this mug was perfect for me . <p> If you are really interested in keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industrial sized bag of pea gravel for drainage . I find the small single-serve bags of pebbles over-priced and gimmicky . <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358 
@@48796293 @2296293/ <p> Do you have an upcoming trip to Ireland but no idea what to pack ? One of the questions I get asked many times in America is if it rains all the time in Ireland . I think most Irish people will answer with a resounding " yes " but in truth , it does n't  ! We definitely have our unfair share of cold , overcast and dreary days which monopolize any memories of sunshine . We certainly do have unfortunate spells of wet weather but all the time seems like an exaggeration to me . Ireland is a beautiful country and when the sun shines it is out of this world ! <p> You could arrive in Ireland and be greeted with a miserable period of wet weather or a stretch of brilliant , warm , sunshine but more than likely you will experience a whole range of weather systems in one day ! Packing for all eventualities and a variety of different activities can be hard work . Add in the complications of carry-on luggage if you are n't  the type to check a bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first leg of a larger European trip , I will provide you with some tips to make packing for Ireland stress-free , practical and stylish ! <h> What To Pack For Ireland <p> VERSATILITY . Choose versatile , mix &amp; match items of clothing . If you 're traveling during the Winter then shorts and sun dresses clearly wont be required . I find it an awful lot easier to dress for cold weather . Choose neutral colored sweaters or cardigans to wear over jeans or trousers . If you 're visiting during milder times then these items can also we worn with capris and shorts . <p> LAYERS . Layers are key when packing for volatile weather . In Summer pack tank tops , tees and shirts to layer over shorts/jeans . In Winter , thermal long sleeved t-shirts are exceptional at keeping you warm under lightweight sweaters but still allowing you to wear a warm jacket and scarf without looking and feeling like the Michelin man . <p> RAIN COAT . Invest in a good rain coat . Do n't  scrimp on your style , there 's a vast quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather does n't  have to mean you 're stuck wearing an ugly pac-a-mac a-la the 90s . I can only dream of the Burberry Trench Mac ! <p> BOOTS . I wear boots from probably October to April in Ireland . I wont even tell you how many pairs I own . If you 're not into boots then splash out on a comfortable walking shoe . The Cliffs of Moher or Giants Causeway wont be kind to your $15 Forever 21 ballet pumps . In fact , in a shower of rain they will probably disintegrate . If you 're more casual and prefer the likes of Converse or athletic shoes then I suggest something leather rather than fabric . Even if it does n't  rain you might find yourself walking through grass , dirt or sand . <p> GET PHYSICAL . Pack your fitness gear if you 're that way inclined . There are endless hiking and biking opportunities throughout the country , not to mention gym facilities at your hotel it would be rather annoying to have to repurchase that stuff . <p> ACCESSORIES . Accessories are your best friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boa . I 'm talking about hats , scarves and gloves ! Whether its a peaked cap , wool beanie or stylish fedora Ireland can be breezy . A lot of the most beautiful things to see here are in mountainous areas and along the coast or bodies of open water , it WILL be breezy even in the Summer . As for scarves , light summer scarves can more or less always be worn and come in handy on those windy excursions . During the Winter a chunky knit scarf will not go astray . <p> ESSENTIALS . Always and I mean always have a compact umbrella tucked away in your bag . You might pull it out for 5 minutes or 5 hours but either way you 'll be dry . You can probably leave the insect repellent at home but always pack sun cream and lip balm you 'd be surprised how sneaky the sun can be even when its freezing out and the elements are never kind to your lips . I like to take my camera everywhere and also utilize the camera on my phone . Power banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Google maps is a must have f you rent a car in Ireland or even if you just wander around cities . <p> I hope this post makes choosing what to pack for Ireland easier , check out my other post on Packing Your Bags Like A Pro for additional packing tips ! <p> Being Irish and living in America , long haul flights are inevitable as is having to traverse many airports alone due my husbands limited free time for traveling . If someone were to ask me off the top of my head what is the greatest necessity for a long distance flight , aside from being seated in first class I would say having 14 inch legs . Those seats are no joke . Spending 8-10 hours sitting more upright than if you were in a full body cast is a little less than comfortable but until I win the lottery , economy awaits <p> I 've traveled back and forth from Ireland to Europe and from Ireland to the US alone many times . Traveling alone is freeing , terrifying and exhilarating all at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressful when it comes to lugging bags , virtually re-dressing yourself after the security line and just for general companionship . Its always nice to have someone there to help you out and vice versa . <p> I 'm about to embark on my 10th trans-atlantic flight and I want to share some of the lessons learned and things I take with me in order to make traveling somewhat comfortable and dare I say , enjoyable . This is just what works for me and is by no means a hard and fast rule for everyone . <h> My Personal Grievances While Traveling <h> Security Lines <p> " Where did I put the clear plastic bag of bottles ? " // " Why do I have a laptop , a tablet and a camera with me ? " // What if I beep and my stuff goes through and gets stolen while I 'm being patted down ? " // " Why is the agent SO rude ? " <p> Cue sweaty scrambling to put things back into the bag ( that was once so organized ) , put back on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way of the angry man yelling at everyone to KEEP IT MOVING . <p> Wear shoes that are easy to remove and put back on <p> Ladies : wear an outfit that does n't  require a belt <p> Remove your watch prior to joining the line or do n't  wear it at all that day <h> Gate Announcements <p> A lot of airports are so big and/or so busy your gate number will not be on your boarding pass at check-in , especially if you check in early . You need to carefully watch the flight information boards for you gate number and then watch it for change . <p> Not that I had to run to the opposite end of a different terminal at Munich airport once <h> At the Gate/Boarding <p> People . People are my grievance here . <p> STANDING UP 45 MINUTES BEFORE BOARDING just because the attendant has come to his/her station . Irish people are the worst for this and I want to stomp like a toddler every time I witness it . <p> SIT . DOWN . YOU . HAVE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  sit watching every person enter the plane and pray its not them coming to fill the empty seat beside you . And when they do , pray they get the general idea that after a polite smile , inserting headphones into your ears means " I wont be speaking anymore , goodnight " . <p> And what is with the people who fill the overhead bins with jackets forcing you to put your wheelie bag three rows down ? ! NO . <p> Or the ones who stand up to get something from their bag approximately 75 times before take-off and again at 38,000ft , 150 more times . What could possibly be in that thing that you need so desperately that often ? ! Keep it under you feet ! <h> How To Board A Plane Like A Courteous Human Being <p> Wait until your boarding zone is called . You are n't  getting on board before it so sit down <p> Do n't  run through the tunnel like a child entering The Magic Kingdom . Your seat is there waiting for you <p> When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the width of your body . Do not bang it off every single already seated passenger <p> When you get your seat have your coat already off and stow your bags while IN your row , if that 's not possible then do it quickly and smoothly <h> Finally , How To Enjoy Your Long Haul Flight <p> Make sure you have all your necessities from your overhead bag BEFORE you get comfortable or stow them beneath the seat in front of you <p> At hand , I suggest having <p> a book/tablet/laptop ( whatever your choice of entertainment is ) <p> a bottle of water <p> snacks <p> something warm , be it a blanket or your jacket <p> neck pillow <p> hand wipes/hand sanitizer <p> your cosmetic bag ( if you 're that way inclined ) <p> Make the most of the in-flight movies . If you are n't  the type to sleep on a flight like me then you 'd be surprised how quickly a long flight goes while watching some good films ! <p> Some airlines are better than others for offering beverages and snacks . In most cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite often this too , makes the flight go surprisingly quickly . <p> Use the lavatories . Duh , right ? Its daunting for some people but avoiding it is only going to make you seriously uncomfortable . <p> Move your legs around ! It can be extremely dangerous to sit stationery at such an altitude for long periods of time . Wiggle your legs around if you do n't  want to go for a walk . <p> I like to get a window seat where possible . Its not everyones cup of tea but if the rare opportunity arises for me to sleep I can turn towards the window and get my snooze . <p> Enjoy the view ! On my last flight from Orlando to Dublin it was amazing to see daylight on the horizon while still sitting in the darkness of the night . Somewhere over Greenland I looked out only to see the Aurora Borealis I wanted to scream for everyone to check it out but that would n't have been acceptable ! It was stunning . I passed 35 minutes- just watching those amazing dancing green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a blessing so many do n't  get to experience . <p> Packing . Is there a more laborious task ? How can something so awful be associated with something as lovely as travel ? Ugh . But I promise you , packing does n't  have to be the stuff of nightmares . If you do the ground work , the task itself is a doddle . <p> I am the self-professed packing QUEEN ! After many years of frequent European travel and going trans-Atlantic to the USA ( with a carry-on ! ) I have the equivalent of a PhD in the subject . <p> Physically , packing is not difficult . What is difficult is considering what you want to wear , what the weather at your destination calls for , the duration of your stay etc . This is the step that people often skip thus ending up in an 8 hour packing nightmare the night before traveling . <p> I 'm not a fly by the seat of my pants type of girl . In fact , my husband would probably call my organizational habits obsessive crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to two weeks prior , yes really . <h> How To Minimize Packing Stress <p> One-two weeks before you are due to leave look at the long range weather forecast at your destination . Unless it is changing drastically by the day you should have a fair idea of the local weather and in turn , the type of clothing and outerwear you may need . If it is changing dramatically then you will need to have clothing for opposing forecasts on hand . <p> Do laundry at least one week before . Having everything you are considering bringing at hand makes life very easy when it comes to zipping that bag up on time ! <p> Make any travel related purchases a week in advance if possible . Packing can seem daunting enough , shopping in order to be able to pack is even worse . <p> Pour your toiletries into small travel bottles in advance of your trip . Large and bulky full-sized shower gels and lotions will add ridiculous amounts of weight to your bag . <p> Hot weather vacations are probably the easiest type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pretty self explanatory : swimwear ; beachwear ; dinner-time . Done . The same could be said for a cold weather getaway . Snow apparel for day-time , chunky knits and boots for dinner etc . City breaks however , can be more difficult to plan for . Especially European travel where the weather can be rather erratic . <h> Choosing The Right Clothing <p> Bring staple pieces that can be worn multiple ways . For example your favorite jeans that can be dressed up for dinner and worn casually during the day . Or a cardigan that will provide some warmth in the day with shorts and also over your dress for dinner . <p> Always bring more tops than bottoms . <p> If you think you have too many shoes , you do . Reconsider the 5 ? stilettos . The cobble streets of Medieval Prague wont be kind to your little piggies . <p> Bring a jacket . The one thing you may not end up wearing but wont regret taking up space in your bag . <p> Wide brimmed felt or wool hats ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment and make for a stylish look while being super practical in a breezy/wet city situation . <h> The Nitty Gritty <p> Lay out everything you 're bringing in such a way that you can see everything . <p> Put shoes and boots on the bottom and in them roll underwear , tank tops , any other small items of clothing and accessories . <p> Move on to the next smallest items of clothing and roll ( roll from a flat , neat fold to ensure that they wont crease ) , then place them into the gaps created on the bottom of the case by your shoes . <p> At this point you should have built a flat , gap-less layer . <p> Now you can add any cosmetic bags , building up the rest of the layer with jeans and shorts . <p> Finally the top layer should be designated for dresses , skirts and delicate items such as tops and blouses that will easily crease . By allowing them plenty of space to minimally fold them they should survive the journey unscathed . <p> Unless you have plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When you 're done with your main bag , pack your handbag while you 're still in packing mode . <p> You are set ! <p> Go have fun on your travels you jetsetter ( you 're prepared after all ! ) <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358 
@@48796294 @2296294/ <p> Pregnancy is full of advice welcome advice , unsolicited advice , good advice , questionable advice . Its also full of anticipation . The type of anticipation Ive never experienced and I 'm an anxious person ! Time both flies and stands still and although you expect a baby , you do n't  yet have a baby so you have a lot of time alone with your thoughts . While ruminating on worries and fears is n't good for you at this time , it is a great time to get ready and research some of those things everyone whose ever been pregnant is telling you . <p> So you and google sit for many hours together building your skill-set for motherhood . With weeks to go you 've got this ! You 're ready for the explosion of love . You 're ready to be awake for the rest of your life . You 're ready to hold your little bundle and be everything she needs . You 're ready for the towering laundry and messier home . <p> But here 's the thing <p> No . You . Are n't  . <p> The reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NOTHING can prepare you for the impending shift in your head , your heart , your home your life . <h> Birth <p> I was lucky enough to have an amazing , positive birth experience despite having to undergo a c-section for a scary reason . Whether your birth is memorable for being amazing , traumatic or just miraculous in general it is a life altering experience and I 'm not sure the roller coaster of emotion connected to it can ever be written down and communicated effectively . <h> The Love <p> Oh , the love . Indescribable , earth shattering love . How something so little can reduce you to such mush is beyond my comprehension . You created perfection and the wave of awe is quite overwhelming . I would look at my baby with tears in my eyes for the first few weeks . I could not look at her without crying or wanting to . I 'm sure hormones had something to do with that also <h> Sleep Deprivation <p> We all know . We KNOW new parents ( and seasoned parents ) get no sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evil . Exhaustion makes you think horrible things , have a short temper and overall be the more gremlin version of your usual self . If sleep is for the weak then I 'm waving my white flag . I AM WEAK . There is no shame in craving your sleep with a newborn . You can not pour from an empty cup and with a newborn your cup is usually very empty . Except your coffee cup , that 's always full of the coffee you no longer get to finish ! <h> Breastfeeding <p> For me , this was the biggest shock to the system even over the loss of all sleep . I was not prepared , not remotely and this came out of nowhere and threw my whole world upside down . I thought I had researched it to a tee . To this day I am struggling with it but determined to persevere . Nursing is exhausting , especially at the beginning . It drained the life and soul out of me and made me feel like a total failure . I am not ashamed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was led to believe it would be . <h> The Loss of Yourself <p> Let me be clear here . Missing who you were does not make you selfish . It makes you a human struggling with change . When a newborn hits your home like a tornado and pjs , no make-up and four day old topknots become your new look it can be very overwhelming . You start to feel like you exist only to sustain your child and clean . It is pure survival mode with little else to spare and it can make you very , very sad . Do not feel guilty for mourning the loss of your old life . <h> Time <p> Savor every second because the time flies . Cliche or sad , terrifying reality ? Both ! I feel like I am outside my body looking at someone holding down a fast forward button while watching mine and babys life play out on screen . It will make you sad to see how quickly your baby grows up . It is of course wonderful to see them develop but equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So my advice is to STOP preparing to be ready for it all . Because you just never will . You can do the legwork for motherhood but it takes that baby in your arms to really activate your inner Mama Bear . That 's when the real learning begins . And its powerful . <p> Remember that hospital bag checklist post I published before baby arrived ? here 's my update on how that stuff actually worked out for me . Clue : it did n't  . <p> At 37 weeks and 5 days pregnant I went in for one of my last routine prenatal check-ups only to find that baby was coming via c-section later that SAME day . Luckily I had tentatively packed my bags but there was still an element of surprise I was sure I 'd never experience . When you 're in shock like that , even adding the remaining 3 or 4 unpacked items can seem like a huge challenge . I mean , who is in the frame of mind right then to pack intelligently ? I was n't . Although I did curl my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three bags in tow . I left babys bag and my recovery bag in the car , bringing in with me a small tote containing the few essentials I would need for waiting . Because waiting is never fun . In that bag I had my tablet , phone charger , camera and personal essentials like lip balm , hand cream , hair ties , clips etc . Mistake number one ! I did n't  need that bag . I was admitted at 3.45pm , gowned by 3.50pm and by 4.45 I was being prepped for surgery ! That bag turned into an inconvenience that had to be looked after at the nurses station and despite the fact that I was about to have major surgery and meet my baby , I was worrying about my belongings being safe . <p> Fast forward one hour . I was wheeled out of the OR , into a recovery unit where I spent another hour being prodded , poked and watched for surgical complications . Once I was sent to my room , I relaxed . I met my nurse , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with baby in my arms . WE STAYED LIKE THIS FOR 2 DAYS . <p> I wore hospital gowns for my entire stay , they were far more convenient for skin-to-skin and feeding . Baby wore a diaper the entire time as she was skin-to-skin practically the whole stay . She was swaddled in hospital blankets and literally the ONLY thing she used that I brought was a hat ( the hospital also supplied me with 3 ) . In fact , the hospital supplied me with EVERYTHING . Diapers , wipes , blankets , hats , nasal aspirator , bath wash , wash cloths , hair brush , you name it it was there . I was so happy but also kicking myself for agonizing over the bag of goodies I had packed . Not to mention , baby was only 5lbs 11oz and to this day still hardly fits into anything I brought with me . I used nothing but deodorant and my toothbrush until I was going home when I got dressed for the first time ! The hospital provided me with all of my recovery essentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other toiletries . <p> Long story short , I cant wait to have my second baby and rock up to labor &amp; delivery with nothing but my handbag . Well not literally but I will be going full minimalist ! <h> What I 'd Bring The Second Time Around <p> Boppy Pillow <p> Baby Going Home Outfit <p> Mom Going Home Outfit <p> 1 Muslin Swaddle Blanket <p> 1 Newborn Hat <p> Basic toiletries <p> Camera <p> I mean it , that 's it ! <p> What was your hospital stay like ? Were you given everything or left to fend for yourself ? <p> Baby arrived unexpectedly three days prior to posting but more on that later ! * <p> It is almost baby time , people ! I cant believe it , we are just days ( hopefully not weeks ! ) away from meeting baby ! On that note , I 'll be taking a month off from blogging to learn how to mom but will be active on social media and hopefully reappear here some time in May . As I reflect on my pregnancy I wanted to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day weekend we took a trip to Charleston where I had a surprise babymoon/maternity photo shoot thanks to my husband ! From the start , I had always wanted to do maternity photos but it was one of those things I kept putting off for a multitude of reasons . <p> We drove the short two hour drive to Charleston that Friday . I immediately kicked myself for spending two years living in Savannah and not visiting sooner ! Downtown Charleston oozes charm and sophistication . It is the gastronomic capital of the South and has all the fun of the seaside just a stones throw away . It really is the perfect city for everyone whether you want a family vacation , romantic getaway or girls weekend ! <p> Our first stop before the city was Folly Beach , a popular vacation spot just outside Charleston . We met the lovely Melissa of Oakley Photography and had a 2 hour session with her . My maternity shoot was my first ever photo shoot besides my wedding photos . I was so hesitant to have maternity photos taken because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mattered . Melissa is down to earth , funny and manages to make you feel so at ease . She knows exactly what shes doing and has a great eye for flattering shots . I couldnt be happier with my photos , its been a while since I felt that pretty and she made it happen effortlessly . <p> There 's something pretty powerful about growing a little person inside you and her photos exude exactly how I feel about that ! <p> Whether its your first baby or your fifth , newborns come with overwhelmingly long to-do lists ! When you are entirely preoccupied with everything you must do to prepare for babys arrival , its easy to forget the monotonous things that still need tending to in our day to day lives . Who wants to have a newborn baby , be overwhelmed by motherhood and realize you have to go to the store for toilet paper ? Not this gal ! With just a couple of weeks left before babys arrival , I 'm sharing with you a list of things to get done that you will either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Your Hair ! <p> This one is n't the most important , I admit , but you deserve some pampering mama ! Its not easy waddling around feeling super uncomfortable 24/7 . Get your hair done and relish your glamorous locks before they 're full of spit up on the regular . Not to mention , finding 2-3 hours for a hair appointment wont be an option very soon ! <p> Another good and important one would be to visit the dentist . Did you know that women are far more susceptible to dental problems during pregnancy ? Now is the time for a check-up or even just a clean . Who knows when you might get time to go again . <h> Make Lists <p> This is the crazy organized part of me shining through . I have compiled a list of family and friends numbers who we want to share the news of babys arrival with immediately . This helps to avoid forgetting someone when you 're running on endorphins and wont exactly be thinking of Uncle so and so who then gets super offended that he saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell everyone online and offend them all equally . Whatever your view is , its your baby ! <p> A perhaps more achievable list to compile is a list of recipients for your Thank You cards as you receive registry gifts . I did n't  have a baby shower but we were still flooded with gifts from family and friends . For the love of God do n't  fail to thank those who have sent you something . Rude ! Even if you do n't  do it as they arrive , be sure to send a birth announcement card with a thank you from baby attached . <h> Deep Clean <p> And by deep clean , I mean have your ever-so-gracious and helpful partner do it or hire someone . Do n't  attempt all that bending and scrubbing alone . Have rooms/closets organized , carpets shampooed , windows cleaned and basically any big Spring cleaning kind of task that more than likely will not get done with a newborn around . <p> Since January we have been taking a room or area of the house each week in which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseboards . My husband has shampooed the carpets and we maintain a twice weekly quick and general cleaning of the whole house to keep it up . <h> Stockpile Household Necessities <p> 2 days postpartum is not the time to find out you have run out of bin liners , toilet paper , disinfectant etc . Have everything stocked up that you use week to week . Its not like bathroom cleaning spray is going to be at the forefront of your mom brain . <p> I went to my local Sams Club and stocked up on TP , paper towels , trash bags , body wash , razor blades , toothpaste , pantry staples such as cereals , pasta , grains , sauces &amp; seasonings and also , a large freezer meat supply ! Im subscribed to diapers and other baby essentials on Amazon Prime so I can rest assured that will be taken care of . Basically all I will need weekly is fresh produce and dairy which my husband can help out with by quickly picking up on the way home from work . <h> Prepare The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle pet hair free when babys due date is getting close ! We have an SUV that will be perfect for carting around babys gear but up until now its been the personal Uber car for our Labradoodle . Let 's just say he got WAY more lab than poodle and he sheds like a maniac every February or if he s just been bathed . Weve vacuumed out the car and installed the car seat to ensure no floating Doodle hairs end up on the baby . Ew . Poor Darby is now limited to riding in less style in my husbands commute-to-work car . But he does n't  mind once he ends up at the park , the beach or his friend Olafs house ! <h> Prepare Freezer or Crockpot-Ready Meals <p> This one takes effort but oh goodness will it be worth it when you 're so tired you could crumple in a heap and cry ! I 'm a big supporter of the crockpot . That glorious device that I dump stuff into and can magically eat 8 hours later . Set aside an evening to plan your meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the day assembling . Again , request help with this one . This is definitely a task where many hands make light work . Stock up on freezer bags and get to it . Itll be so satisfying to see your meals for a solid month or more all taken of ! You will be less tempted to order fast food . This is not only costly but not the healthiest for new mothers , especially if nursing your baby . <h> Bonus + Often Overlooked Task ! <h> Make Arrangements for Pet Care <p> This gives me the most anxiety . Babies are n't  exactly known for their perfect , convenient arrival times on their exact due date . Were lucky to have the worlds best puppy sitter ! Shes flexible and ever so good to the Dood . Ensure you have someone lined up to take care of your pet . Decide whether they will take them to their place or stay at yours . These plans will be loose until the big day . Most people are understanding about the unknowns in this situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six weeks have passed since my last update , it feels like I just blinked and February was suddenly over . I 'm officially in the 9th month of my pregnancy and it could very well even be baby month ! Its a little bittersweet . Although I have been through the general worries that come with pregnancy , I have enjoyed this time and made a conscious effort to soak up the entire experience . I have had it pretty easy , medically , and honestly have n't yet thought I am so sick of being pregnant ! . I think I 'm going to be of those annoying women who whines about missing their bump ! <p> This post may contain affiliate links <p> Something I did struggle with and still do in my pregnancy is some emotional issues that go beyond raging hormones . Needless to say , depression and stress are not good for baby . Today , as well as a quick pregnancy update I want to share with you some of my absolute self care lifesavers in these final weeks . Now , more than ever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help that baby pack on the pounds ! Its also your final time just being you . Alone . Kind of scary , huh ? A little guilt free indulgence is just what the doctor ordered ! <h> Boppy Pregnancy Wedge <p> I bought this rather late , probably around week 28 but it has been so good for supporting the bump and my back both in bed and while sitting on the couch . <h> Essential Oil Diffuser <p> Give me all of the calming lavender oil ! I love my diffuser and its really fun to create new blends . I 'm not an essential oil expert by any means but its an interesting new world to me ! Just make sure the oils you are using are n't  harmful to your pregnancy . <h> Back Support <p> I admit I do n't  use this daily but if I have some chores to do or anything that involves standing for a little longer than I 'm used to this is a life saver ! It takes the pressure off my abdomen and also my lower back . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones than this but for my needs its perfect . <h> Glam Glow Super-Mud Clearing Treatment <p> This ones for sure an indulgence ! I have problematic skin since I was 13 years old and pregnancy has wreaked even more havoc . This is the only glow in my third trimester . I 'm pretty certain while the mask is on I can almost feel the gunk being sucked out of my pores . Gross but satisfying . I 'm not usually one for cult beauty products but for me , this really works . <h> Compression Socks <p> As well as long road trips , I did some international travel during my second trimester so compression socks were a must for my circulation during my flights . If you 're on your feet all day , I highly suggest donning a pair of these . They are also recommended during c-section recovery if that happens to be on the cards for you . <h> Measured Water Bottle <p> After becoming dehydrated a few times I got very serious about my water intake . It is so important for baby . I drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that is thanks to the marked measurements . I drink a certain amount by a certain time of day and by 8pm I 'm confident I have satisfied my water intake ! <h> Body Pillow <p> From the start a body pillow seemed like a pointless expense . Enter the third trimester ! YOU . NEED . THIS . Sleep is fleeting or non existent . Do everything you possibly can to get some . <h> Burts Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter <p> I used this from day one . I 'm sure its more down to my body type and the fact that I 'm very slight but so far I have no stretch marks . I apply this to my belly and chest after a shower and again before bed . It does n't  react in any negative way and leaves my skin feeling so soft ! <h> 36 Weeks Pregnancy Update <p> According to the app , at 36 weeks baby is the size of a honeydew melon ! Baby weighs close to 6 lbs and is around 18.5 inches long . <p> Total weight gain <p> 24 lbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Maternity jeans are my BFF on weekends as well as soft jersey midi dresses ! <p> Stretch marks <p> None and happy to get to 36 weeks without any but I wo n't mind too much if I still do . <p> Sleep <p> I 'm really struggling to fall asleep these past few weeks . Sticking to sleeping on my left side makes my face numb and kills my neck ! I still do ok once I actually fall asleep but getting there is so difficult . Its often well past 2am before I get to sleep . I feel exhausted all the time but trying not to nap as it makes falling asleep even more difficult . <p> Longing for <p> All the sweets , soft drinks and caffeine in the world . I guess cravings only hit me in the third trimester ! I 'm doing well with not giving in to every craving . Sodas are not consumed , coffee is only allowed once a week and sweets are kept to a minimum ! <p> Movement <p> Baby is pretty cramped in there now so feeling jabby little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been feeling . It seems the baby has the hiccups often though which is a rather strange sensation . Sometimes it continues for ages . <p> Out as much as it will be . Still doing its weird half and half thing and still freaking me out . <p> Wedding rings on or off ? <p> On and still wrestling to take to them off , especially in our warm Georgia Spring weather . <p> Happy or moody ? <p> Anxious , which more often than not leads to moodiness over happiness ! <p> Looking forward to <p> Installing the car seat , placing my bags by the door and setting up some baby gear around the house . Its suddenly very real . It will feel even more real when my family visits later in the month . I cant wait to hear an Irish accent = <p> Not another hospital bag post , you cry ! Yes . I 'm not even sorry because reading so many helped me immensely ! Way back in December , I had a slight baby scare which thankfully turned out fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously thinking about packing my hospital bag at just week 24 . Since then , it was not fully packed but I made it my priority to buy and organize what I needed . This week ( at 34 weeks ) I finally packed it along with the changing bag for baby . <p> After reading quite literally EVERY what to pack article in existence , I have packed some of the highly recommended hospital bag essentials along with the things I deem applicable to me . <p> Conscious that a c-section might be a possibility , I have packed enough for a more extended stay than most women will have . I have still kept those extra items practical and to a minimum . <h> The Highly Recommended Must-Haves <p> Baby Keepsake Book to get hand/foot prints and save the mess later ! <p> Camera/Tablet/Phone + chargers <p> Boppy nursing pillow to practice good nursing posture <p> Healthy snacks for after the birth in case the hospital food is truly awful <h> The Basics <p> Packing Cubes ! All hail packing cubes . Seriously , these are packing game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luggage again ! <p> Basic toiletries <p> Travel hair dryer . I do n't  feel like standing for an hour trying to dry my hair with one of those pathetic hospital/hotel dryers that feels like a small child is blowing on your head . <p> A flattering , soft jersey midi dress for going home in comfort , easeand style . <h> The Will I Need This ? Stuff- ( To Be Left In The Car ! ) <p> Do you get the sense that I 'm an organization over-achiever ? ! Every hospital is different . Some will give you everything you need and others will let you fend for yourself for the most part . At least through extensive research on this , that 's the general consensus . So while many moms tell you point blank what not to bring , others have said they werent provided with it at all . <p> This is the stuff I am unsure about and have packed in a tote bag that will stay in the car . If I do need it , my husband can grab it rather than visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Extra snacks/drinks in case the hospital food is unbearable <p> Pain relief medication <p> Post-delivery feminine products ( this could be a post of its own and I wont go into the gory details ) <p> Extra onesies in different sizes . Despite buying newborn and 0-3 months in various brands , they all differ . Some look tiny and others look far too big . I do n't  want to take a thousand outfits with me but I would like them to fit baby , whatever size he or she turns out to be . This way I 'll have at least 2/3 outfits that will fit . <h> The Items I 'm NOT Packing <p> My own labor/delivery gown . I 100% plan to deliver baby in the hospital issued gown . I 'm vain but not spend $50+ on a designer labor gown vain . An item of clothing that will most likely end up covered in bodily fluids and newborn gunk . <p> A pillow from home . For the same reasons as above and also because there are about 100 of them on the bed I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women suggest yoga pants or some form of comfy pants for after the birth . While I totally agree with the comfort factor , I understand there will be a LOT of checking down there after baby arrives . I will be in no mood to keep wriggling my way out of leggings for my nurse . Nightgowns it is ! <p> Hair tools . Straighteners , curling irons etc . Some people recommend them for photos but I do n't  see it happening even considering as fussy as I can be with my hair ! Ill be blast drying and curling my hair around a headband to get loose waves for going home day ! <p> Spring has sprung and so has my baby bump ! At 34 weeks pregnant , I am feeling lethargic , anxious and less than attractive . One sure fire way to improve my mood when I 'm feeling down is to dress myself up . Dressing up while eight months pregnant however , is no easy task . You are more than likely bored stiff of wearing whatever still fits you . Cue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This post was in partnership with Pink Blush . As always , all opinions are my own . <p> I wanted something feminine and comfortable to serve me throughout the rest of my pregnancy in a warm Georgia Spring . I was also keen to find something that could be worn postpartum for easy nursing . None of us are the perfect size and shape but I find it especially hard to shop for dresses to suit my frame as I am 6 feet tall . Short dresses on me could be deemed a criminal offense and typically , maxi dresses sit somewhere in the middle of my shins hot stuff ! So for me , finding the perfect midi dress is like hitting the jackpot . <p> To flatter the bump and to suit babys nursing needs , I chose this hi-lo style midi number . Nothing says Goodbye , Winter ! like a pretty floral print and a little big of leg ! I instantly fell in love with the dress that ticked all the boxes . This dress not only showcases the bump adorably but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That equates to the trifecta of cute maternity clothes in case you did n't  know ! <p> I noticed the companys tagline is Effortless styles for the modern mother and theyve certainly got it right . Pregnancy clothes are typically NOT cute , let 's be honest ! If you 're searching for gorgeous , on-trend maternity wear , then I suggest taking a look at Pink Blush . You 'll find not only maternity wear but regular sizes , plus sizes , shoes and accessories too . <p> I was always aware that babies are expensive little beings but I quickly realized just how expensive . It was an eye-opening experience setting up for baby ! I am so grateful to our families for gifting us the big ticket items like the stroller , car seat , crib etc . Between those gifts , re-purposing furniture , building our own ( thanks husband ) and my own frugality we have managed to set up for baby at a fraction of the real cost . Hopefully this post will give you an eye for a great baby bargain just like I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way stingy . In fact , I have champagne taste but live with a sparkling water budget . I would definitely call myself frugal . I shop around A LOT and a nose around Goodwill is not beneath me , especially when they carry department store overstock ( OMG ! ) . My favorite stores for great deals are Home Goods , TJ Maxx and- sometimes , one particular Ross near my home . The gems to be found in these stores are hard to beat but its often luck of the draw with what bargain they may have in stock on the day you 're visiting . This is the perfect excuse to go often ! <h> Where To Find The Best Baby Bargain <h> Goodwill <p> A year ago I walked into my local Goodwill ( my first Goodwill trip ever ) and quickly turned my nose up . I actually said EW . Fast forward to 2016 and while doing a donation drop-off at a brand new store , I gave it another chance and wandered into the baby clothes section . I am hooked ever since ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of 4 different Goodwill stores in my locale are two Army installations . Army posts mean families moving in and out of the area constantly . This in turn means families purging their unwanted items often . The presence of military families also means there 's lots of babies around . While many , many adult garments at Goodwill may be ratty and suspect , the baby clothes are in a league of their own . Over the course of about 8 weeks I have purchased a hoard of completely unworn or worn-once onesies and full outfits . My total is usually under $6 and I come away with 6-8 outfits . <p> Honestly , I often feel guilty buying at Goodwill . I feel like I am stealing the eyes out of someones head . They have a color-of-the-week offer which means that if you have a bunch of items on your arm bearing that color plastic barb , then that item is half price . In the infant section , this means your outfit could cost you just 49- ! On Sundays , ALL items with the color-of-the-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes <p> Enough adorable infant clothing to dress every baby in North America . I will re-donate any items I do n't  end up using . Brands including Ralph Lauren , Tommy Hilfiger , GAP , Janie &amp; Jack , OshKosh , Little Me , Carters and more ( 49-99- per item ) <p> V-Tech Light &amp; Move Learning Ball- that has been thoroughly disinfected and is like brand new ( $1.99 -versus- $14.99 ) <p> Two soft fold-out books including a Winnie the Pooh clip on stroller book with a tag on . Both washed like a dream ( 39- each -versus $7-10 ) <h> TJ Maxx <p> Ok , while TJ is one of my favorite stores , it can be as hit and miss as Goodwill . Their inventory changes constantly so if you spot something you have to snap it up there and then . I promise you it wont be there next week , or even later that day . I have found so many baby items at a fraction of the cost and though most of their stock is passed season or slightly flawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons styles and prints . Have a good look at something you like in case it is damaged ( it probably is n't ) and put it in your cart pronto ! Sometimes the flaw and reason an item is there is a tiny as a seam sewn off center . If you are n't  fussy , you will never even notice . <h> Marshalls <p> At Marshalls you will find similar things to TJ or even the same . If you cant find what you need at one , be sure to check the other . <h> Ross <p> I do n't  shop here very often . In fact I have purchased something from a Ross store only twice . This past weekend I was looking for something specific so I perused my local and nicest Ross ! I did n't  buy one because I have one already but they had Boppy Nursing pillows for $24 ! Granted , it was n't the cutest slipcover they make but those bad boys retail for $39.99 ! <p> I did buy a large faux sheepskin area rug for babys room for $30 versus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I LOVE Home Goods . This place is the dream for kitting out babys room for a bargain . With goods much like Marshalls and TJ Maxx but with a focus on the decor side of things , obviously . Some of my finds include ; <p> More hangers ! <p> Storage boxes/Laundry Hamper ( $4-25 -versus- $15-50+ ) <p> Diaper caddies ( $6-12 -versus- $20+ ) <p> Clip on musical crib nightlight/soother ( $6 -versus $20+ ) <p> A-Z Bookends ( $7 -versus- $20+ ) <h> Amazon <p> Amazon may not be a discount store per se but as I am a Prime member it has been worth every cent . As a Prime member I qualify for free two-day shipping , unlimited free TV/movie streaming , unlimited photo storage , access to Prime Pantry ( groceries on your door step ? Yes please ! ) and more . <p> As a Prime member you are also eligible to become a member of Amazon Family . You can make an Amazon Baby Registry and qualify for a FREE welcome box choc full of baby items and free samples/coupons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item of your choice on your registry and a number of other offers including a free Kindle e-book and discounted clothing . <p> For me , the best part about Amazon Prime are the subscription options . When you subscribe to diapers ( you choose the frequency of their delivery ) you get 20% off and a $2 off coupon on your first delivery . If you subscribe to a total of 5 items at once then the 5% savings on each one becomes 15% ! The bargain price of sub $25 for 200+ diapers and peace of mind that they will arrive on my doorstep in 48 hours is especially worth it to me . I subscribe to dog food , baby wipes and other personal items which means I never have to remember them on my weekly grocery shop . <p> I am so happy with my baby bargain stockpile as I get such a kick out of having exactly what I wanted and still having a little extra cash in my purse ! Off the top of my head , there is over $500 of savings just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every single item I have purchased on this journey ! ) including the retail value of the baby clothing from Goodwill . <p> The pregnancy journey is thrilling , especially for first time mothers . You want to scream it from the roof tops while simultaneously wanting to not tell anyone out of- sheer worry . In our social media age a tendency to share every facet of lives exists for many . Whether its a status on Facebook , a photo on Instagram or a witty one liner on twitter its so easy to share your excitement without fully acknowledging exactly who can see it . I admit it myself that sometimes I snap a photograph with social media in mind and not solely to capture a memory . <p> Let 's be honest , many of use have friends on social media we would n't exactly consider to be close . Platforms like twitter and Instagram can invite literally anyone to view your content . This is why for the most part I have n't documented too many milestones of my pregnancy on the blog . I find it rather eerie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal experience of mine . <p> That said , I read blogs daily where people go into graphic detail about the inner workings of their womb . Some announce their pregnancy on the day they discover it . Others declare the gender of their baby to the public . I have even seen some publish teaser posts inviting readers to guess babys name ! This is definitely a different pregnancy world to the one I knew growing up . Or at least the one I thought I knew . I personally am more private about my pregnancy . It is overwhelmingly exciting but I would rather contain that excitement within the bounds of my family and friends . <p> My crux with baring all throughout pregnancy however is not what I read online . I take no issue with what women choose to post and fully admit to thoroughly enjoying many of these posts ! My problem lies with the people I meet in the street <p> Whether it is due to being surrounded by such open accounts of pregnancy or just a- general sense of entitlement I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a regular basis . As soon as the bump popped and my pregnancy became apparent , I noticed that some people took it as a green light to ask pretty personal questions . Or at least questions I feel are inappropriate and would n't dream of asking others . <h> My Top Three Irritating Pregnancy Questions ! <p> What are you having ? <p> This one is the only one that makes me genuinely mad and want to respond with a passive aggressive , " a baby " . I do not believe that because some people happily announce their babys gender that it is free game in every other pregnancy . What makes people think they have a right to such a deeply intimate fact ? <p> Another question comes with this one and it is , " Do you know but are n't  saying ? " or " Do you reeeeeeally not know ? " . <p> STOP IT . If you have been given a firm , " we have n't found out " then please accept it and move on . <p> What names are you thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you considered any names ? " . This question seeks to know what those names are . BEFORE YOUR BABY ARRIVES . The baby is going to come out of me faster and more easily than that information . Keep walking . <p> When are you due ? because you 're tiny *stares at bump* <p> Admittedly , this is not an offensive question at all . However it is when paired with a disapproving glance at your belly and a comment about your size . Please stop skinny shaming me . I am 6ft tall and there 's plenty of torso for baby to hide in . FYI my baby is slightly above normal fetal growth rate ! Relax . <p> I have n't documented much of my pregnancy on the blog because I wanted to keep it private but now a part of me wishes I had ! Time has flown by and it has truly surprised me how fleeting these moments really are. - Its hard to believe I am in the final weeks of this pregnancy single digits now ! <p> I swore at the beginning I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't  . I was either too busy , feeling too gross or just forgot until I was already into another week . During the first 16 weeks , there was no bump to photograph anyway ! Personally , I like to read about what different women experience at different stages . No two pregnancies are the same but it can be comforting to know what you could expect or even just know you are n't  alone in what you are experiencing. - Now that I have officially entered the third trimester , I have decided to post a little update . <h> How far along ? <p> 30 weeks <h> Babys Size <p> A cantaloupe according to my app ! Baby weighs over 3.5 lbs <h> Total weight gain <p> 18 lbs <h> Maternity clothes <p> Over-the-bump jeans ( H&amp;M Mama maternity skinny jeans are LIFE ! They are super affordable too and often on sale. ) since week 16 and some maternity tops since week 25 although most werent necessary they were just cute . I still have many wearable non-maternity tops . All my leggings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet but the itchiest skin &gt;. &lt; <h> Sleep <p> Theres three scenarios here : <p> If I can get to sleep at a decent hour , I am out until baby uses my bladder as a punching bag . Which is usually about 1000 times a night . In this case I usually get back to sleep . <p> I get to sleep after midnight but then sleep through until the early morning . <h> Longing for <p> To nest . All day every day . I have an insatiable desire to organize ALL THE THINGS ! <p> A somewhat comfortable sleep position . <p> To finally meet baby . <h> Movement <p> Lots and lots . Its always a party in there . Mostly early in the morning , late afternoon and around 10pm . Now that baby is getting a bit cramped in there , the movements are lessviolent ! <h> Cravings <p> Nothing odd and nothing in particular ! If I had to say anything I would say cinnamon rolls . But you do n't  need to be pregnant to want those all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since I was so sick in the first trimester I figure it will strike again somewhere in the third . <h> Gender <p> Waiting for baby to reveal all ! <h> Symptoms <p> Indigestion after most foods but not so much heartburn , difficulty sleeping , back ache , fatigue , general lack of motivation to do anything and although my bump is small the beginning of a very attractive waddle . <h> Belly button in or out ? <p> A weird , neither in nor out at the moment and it freaks me out so much . <h> Wedding rings on or off ? <p> Still on although at the end of most days they do n't  want to come off . <h> Happy or moody most of the time <p> Both . Predominantly moody though . Mostly feeling a mix of excitement and overwhelm in these weeks where baby has become more real . <h> Looking forward to <p> Completing the nursery , finalizing name options , trying to relax knowing everything is ready ( HA ! When will that be ? ! ) and giving you another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358 
@@48796295 @2296295/ <p> Long time , no post my friends ! Its been 8 joyful ( and exhausting ) weeks of being a mother and I was long overdue a new post . I planned on taking a month long blog break ( HA ! ) but evidently I overestimated my abilities to juggle it all . Motherhood has been the steepest learning curve of my life but I would n't change it for the world . My crafty side has been twitching from being so stagnant and today I 'm bringing you this adorable DIY name project . Put your own spin on it and add the sweetest personal touch to babys room ! <p> I love my babys name . I should , should n't I ? I spent nine long months agonizing over what it might be and hopefully she likes it just as much ! Im amazed by the amount of people who have n't heard the name before . In case you have n't heard of it , here 's a little background . <p> I always wanted to display the babys name in the nursery but was n't sure how . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individually and since there are six of them in hers I was n't too wild about six permanent holes in my already terrible walls ! If you search baby name craft on Pinterest you will be able to scroll for hours through wood letter craft . Some of them were just too well , pinterest for me . I wanted something elegant and dainty yet without fuss . <p> To the craft store ! The best part of this was the fact that I bought everything I needed for under $15 ! I decided on scrapbook paper to decorate . Rather than sticking to one pattern I got four different kinds for a mismatched , feminine look . <p> Making the name was easy as pie . I simply drew around the letters on my paper of choice , carefully cut out the shape ( using a sharp scissors ! ) then mod podged it to the wood . Done ! <p> Initially , I was going to display the letters simply . I purchased a narrow frame shelf on Amazon with the intention of propping them up against the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and size of the shelf and so that was nixed . The shelf now displays some of her prettiest books in what turned into a happy accident ! In the end I chose to arrange the letters in a fun design and glue them together before hanging the name as one piece . I absolutely love how it turned out ! <h> Did you do any nursery craft ? Feel free to share in the comment section = <p> This blog has given me a serious case of craft-itis ! I get so much inspiration and motivation from reading hundreds of other blogs every month that I now have a massive craft bug and I am thoroughly enjoying it . This week I tried my hand at a simple cloud pillow for Babys nursery . I can not sew . At all . Even a button , it WILL fall off again . I despise sewing . What I can do however , is handle a small , low-temperature hot glue gun ! <p> People often ask me if I 've chosen a theme for Babys nursery and honestly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless you can call gender neutral a theme . Although I love to decorate and sit back to admire my handiwork , I get bored and over analytical . For me , something overly specific was an absolute no-no . <p> Let me tell you , choosing gender neutral decor is easier said than done . It seems these days that a lot of grey and rustic/outdoorsy decor is considered gender neutral . I personally think that stuff , although beautiful , is far more boyish than girly . After I had decided on a white crib and re-purposed my old TV cabinet into a white changing unit ( check it out here ! ) , I found the cutest cloud door handles on Etsy . What 's both baby appropriate and gender neutral ? The sky ! So I settled on clouds , stars , the moon etc. as my central theme that is n't a theme . <p> This easy peasy no-sew cutie will be complete in 30 minutes and costs less than $10-20 depending on where you buy your supplies and the quality you desire ! <h> You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleece , velour its up to you ! ) <p> Poly-fil Stuffing 12oz ( o r see amount requirements for different projects on the package ! ) <p> Low-temp hot glue gun + extra glue sticks <p> Sharp scissors or ideally a fabric shears <p> A sharpie to draw your cloud shape <p> There is no distinct pattern for this project . I completely winged it and you can too ! <h> Method : <p> On a clean , flat surface fold your fabric in half and freehand draw a simple cloud shape on your fabric . If drawing is not your forte then find a shape to copy or trace with a quick google search <p> Once you 're happy with the shape , cut it out ( both sides ) <p> Since the sides you have cut may have sharpie marks showing then make sure you glue this side up ! Make sure both pieces line up and apply a thin , clean line of glue around the edge . Carefully glue edge to edge in small stages 4/5ths of the way around <p> Do n't  forget to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When the glue is dry and you 're happy there 's no missed spots ie , holes , then turn it inside out . The reason for a thin , evenly glued edge is to avoid puckering . It may still appear puckered in spots but you can iron those out ! <p> Start stuffing the pillow carefully , ensuring its totally filled ! It may take a lot depending on how large you made it . Work out the bumps as you go . <p> The trickiest part is sealing the last gap since the fabric is now the right way around . Take your time and slowly glue it as neatly as possibly . Rushing will result in hot glue all over your hands and the outside of the pillow ! <p> Last year I did n't  have a Christmas wreath on our sad little front door but this year in our new house with a beautiful entryway there was no way I could go without ! Wreaths out there were either too expensive for me , too big , too small or justmeh . So I made my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm feeling festive so I guess I will share with you guys = <p> I purchased a plain artificial wreath but you could also use a fresh one ! Once I fluffed up the wreath and gave it a good shape , I sprayed on snow , topped with a large burlap bow and added the CUTEST pair of ice skates in the center . Vintage holiday decor is my favorite and I have been eyeing them up at Hobby Lobby since last year . When I found them again I could n't bear to leave them behind . I do n't  really have anywhere to hang more decorations so this was the perfect solution ! <p> I do n't  need to tell you that babies are expensive little beings . It is rather overwhelming looking around your home and realizing just how much you need to buy for baby . I think the worst kind of baby gear is the stuff that lasts five minutes and is then no longer of any use . Like a bassinet or a changing table . <p> I was lucky to have an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential for a changing unit . This was achieved by simply changing the color ! I was able to create a beautiful piece of furniture for the nursery that can be used as both a changing table and later , a storage unit . What I love about re-purposing a small cabinet is the versatility of the end result . You could remove the doors and add decorative storage boxes to make it more gender/theme specific or you can also choose to- keep the doors and hide boring necessities behind them . <p> I am doing the latter . I have decided to turn this into the ultimate baby changing station ! The upper shelf which is usually for DVD players , game consoles and the like will be a place to store basics like onesies/bibs/burp cloths and the inevitable spare outfits we will need with some changes ! Behind the doors there is one shelf which will be home to endless diapers , wipes and also health and bath products . All I am really adding to this piece is a standard changing pad . <p> For such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiest I have ever done . It had two steps . <p> I have two words people . CHALK . PAINT . <p> Paint that magic potion directly onto your dust-free , un-sanded wood and watch it transform ! Granted , it took four or five coats but if you are not in a rush and have patience then you can get away without prepping . I underestimated how many coats it would need and I went through two tubs before I gave in and bought a bigger one to finish it . If in doubt , buy the bigger tin ! To save time and effort you can sand and fully prep the furniture from the start . The reason I did n't  was because I began during Summer and therefore in the height of my allergy season . It just was n't worth the agony in my eyes and the sneezing fits ! Once you are happy with the coverage you can use a clear wax to seal and protect it . <p> I 'm SO happy with the way this unit turned out and even happier that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I purchased was the paint , wax and door knobs = <p> If you ca n't stand people who love Christmas , LOOK AWAY NOW because today I am bringing you some DIY Christmas wall art ! <p> Move over Fall , Halloween and Thanksgiving , its officially my time ! I 'm not obnoxious about it . I wont decorate for a while and blast carols from my speakers but I ADORE Christmas . I find it amusing how genuinely disgruntled many people become when others get in the Christmas spirit . You do n't  see me pitchin a fit when you all go crazy for pumpkins in August so hush . We can have Halloween decor in stores in July but now I 'm the worst for loving Christmas 8 weeks in advance ? As they say in the South , bless your heart ! <p> Christmas was always a special time for me and since moving away from home its become even more . It was incredibly difficult last year to spend my first Christmas in 27 years away from home . It was even harder to participate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Overall it was just a really emotional and sad time for me . I feel very strongly about carrying on my own Holiday traditions especially now that we are expecting . I cant wait to have Santa Claus again in our home and the magic of Christmas that only children can bring ! <p> So since November is just one sleep away I am sharing with you a super easy festive wall art I made over the weekend . This involves nothing but glue and some craft paint ! You know me , I like the easy stuff ! <p> I picked up this distressed hanging pallet piece a few weeks ago at the craft store and separately , this laser cut decoration . There was no real plan for either and placing them haphazardly on the counter resulted in this project ! I decided to paint the cut-out gold + gold glitter top coat and attach it to the pallet . It makes a great piece of wall art that is simple yet festive ! Remember you can also stain or paint an unfinished pallet very easily if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> First I left it painted gold with the leaf element glittered only but I loved the sparkle so much , I did the whole thing ! Its not overly glittery just a gorgeous shimmer than catches the light . <p> There are so many spooky Halloween wreaths out there but frankly , I think the price tags are equally as frightful . I am a huge fan of Fall decor and do n't  even start me on Christmas but my Halloween decorating is minimal at best . I cant justify having a huge amount of decorations for just one night ( ok , yes ironic since Christmas is technically one day as well ) . So I took things into my own hands using Michaels 40% off one full priced item coupon and made this MINDLESSLY easy , spider web wreath which ended up costing just $7 ! <p> You will need just three items : <p> Plain , twig wreath ( whatever size you want ! ) <p> Spider Web <p> Spiders , of course ! <p> Depending on where you are placing this and what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may need to use wire or glue to secure your spiders . Due to the family of geckos that likes to move into all my front door wreaths and then try jump into my house , I will probably use this indoors as wall decor ! If you are displaying the wreath inside then those spider legs pretty much secure themselves between the twigs . One less step score ! <p> Obviously these wreaths are supposed to be round ( duh ! ) but they are inexpensive and all vary . Choose wisely at the store . When you are ready to start , lay it flat on a table and decide what point will be the top ( where it will sit on the door hanger/nail ) . <p> After this you get to play with your webbing . I used a very small amount , stretching it to the max to ensure it looked more real . The more you use , the clumpier it will be . I wound the web around one side , spending time making it look as true to life as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom half or indeed , all over the entire wreath . <p> Next up spiders ! Sparkly , plastic spiders are much more acceptable than live , hairy ones . This pack had six in it but I used just four . Again , depending on your wreath size , its up to you . You 're all set ! Did I mention this was TOO easy ? ! <p> Propagating succulents is a magical experience . Ok well its not and its got a scientific explanation but once you see it happen , you will have to restrain yourself from hacking your succulents apart continuously to multiple them . Then you will become a crazy succulent lady which quite frankly I think is far more economical than a crazy cat lady . <p> Those of you who follow the blog and/or my Pinterest will know about my new found love of succulents . Back in March I posted Succulents for Beginners which much to my delight , was a hit ! <h> My Original Plants <p> If only my succulents were as successful as the blog post . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye ! As you know , I was home in Ireland for an extended stay and I entrusted my my dear sweet ( soon-to-be ex ) husband with the care of my succulents . Bless his heart , he clearly did n't  read my blog post ! Those bad boys died a serious death . Some were scorched , some drowned , others I assume died of- broken hearts . In fairness I only gave husfriend a watering timeline and little instruction . I just assumed their location was fine and casually forgot to consider that the suns position coming through my skylight would change in six weeks . Oops ! He redeemed himself though by buying me a beautiful Pachyveria and a prickly but cute , climbing Aloe . <p> Of course that couldnt be the end of the story . As I was shooting photos for this post I went out to the back porch where my Aloe was sunning itself and I found my brazen-faced Labradoodle out there munching its roots ! Soil everywhere and a mouth full of roots , that Dood RAN , fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Aloe which I semi-saved and re-potted . <h> Propagating Succulents <p> Propagating my succulents was n't on my agenda just yet but alas , its time . I sadly disposed of my shriveled leaves and trimmed what healthy stems remained . Placing the cuttings aside , I removed any healthy leaves I could salvage by carefully wiggling them away from the stem . My biggest loss was my Eceheveria Pearl von Nurnberg which saddened me as it was so beautiful ! Once you have all stems and leaves that you want to propagate , you will need to leave them to dry away from bright light for a few days to a week . After they are dried and have calloused you can place them in a shallow dish or tray that has a layer of well draining soil ( mixed with sand and small pebbles ) . Dampen the soil but do not drown it . Watch the magic happen ! Within a week you should see tiny succulents budding from the parent leaf/stem . The parent leaf will loosen after a while and it can be easily removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succulents ! <p> It is said that when life hands you lemons you should make lemonade . When life hands you a husband who ca n't keep your succulents alive , propagate more ! <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358 @qwx533358

Put on your best smile and your pointiest elbows and be prepared for an obnoxiously green , semi-racially offensive grand ol time ! I kid of course . Kind of . <p> On March 17th , the whole world seems to honor the Irish famous landmarks go green , parades are held and guinness flows more freely than usual . However , as far as parties go , America wins . You wo n't meet one American on St. Patricks Day whose Dads cousins husbands sisters mail man was Irish and therefore so are they . <h> Surviving St. Patricks Day in America <h> I-rish I Were IRISH <p> My husband always has a new anecdote for me and it cracks me up ! Now and again at his workplace my nationality will come up and the response has more than once been , " Oh really ? I 'm Irish too ! Where is she from ? ! " Now this would be a perfectly acceptable question if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , multiple people have now asked WHAT STATE I am from . Heres what 's wrong , Americans now claim Irish heritage so haphazardly that being Irish no longer means from the country . Its just a generic label and it can simply mean , Ohio . I 'm currently working my way through all fifty States in response . <h> BEGORRAH , BEGOSH , TOP O THE MORNIN <p> and all those other words and phrases that Irish people quite literally never say . They will be repeatedly shouted in your face if your nationality has been exposed . My personal tip for dealing with this is the Carlsberg response of " ci+nas , bothar , cail+n , bainne " . Irish people will know that in our native tongue this means nothing more than " silence , road , girl , milk " a collection of random words . Youve got to give the people what they want ! Tell them it means " you 've never met a nicer person " and be on your merry way . <h> DRUNKEN TOMFOOLERY <p> It sounds like a guys name ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) but in fact its the theme of the day . This is the more offensive aspect of the day for me . A lot of people in the US and beyond view drunken debauchery as the ONLY mark of a true Irishman . Mimic my accent and use stereotypical Irish-isms its fine . I do n't  take it personally because frankly I know a lot of these people genuinely like Ireland , the culture and the accent . They mean no real harm . But hearing that I 'm Irish and responding with a drunk related quip then I 'm going to get real mad , real fast ! Sometimes I like a drink . Sometimes I do n't  like a drink . Contrary to popular belief , holding an Irish passport does n't  mean I binge drink regularly and have Jameson flowing through my veins . <p> Again through my dear husband this wretched stereotype has reached me again and again . Sometimes directly to my face . Its taken me a while but I 've managed to perfect a smile that is much less psychotic than my first few attempts.If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . <p> There I am among a group of people ( all enjoying a quiet drink ) and my friend is asked what she 's drinking , she replies with the name of her cocktail and then Im asked by the same person .

Now should I be mad at that comment or that my friend seemed to be able to enjoy her drink with no rude comment attached at all ? I will stress again that I do n't  really take this one too personally but I DO feel awfully self-conscious every time I take a sip of my drink after such a comment . <p> I will leave my feelings on a certain drink called the Irish Car Bomb " completely out of this post ! <p> If you 're looking for something to remind you of Ireland please let it be beautiful scenery , ancient history or scholarly achievements , not excessive alcohol consumption ! <h> GREEN <p> All shades of it and all at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and drinking it . <p> Last year I attended the parade in Downtown Savannah , the second largest St. Patricks Day parade in the world .

I probably should n't tell you that practically nobody in Ireland with the exception of small kids will wear green on March 17th ! But when in Romewear all the green you can ? <p> Remember to keep it clean people , weve already established the penchant for assuming were a nation of drunks but at kid friendly parades its probably best to keep your explicit t-shirts in the closet at home ! <h> PATTY , THE FORGOTTEN SISTER OF PATRICK <p> At least , that must be who she is because no Irishman is called Patty . Patty is short for Patricia , Paddy is short for Patrick . Those are the rules . " But there 's no T , it makes no sense !

Fortunately , youve all said Patty so much the leprechauns have suffered a massive decrease in population and wont be around to cause any pinch pains . <h> SHAMROCK NOT- FOUR LEAFED CLOVER <p> Shamrock was used to symbolize Christianity in Ireland and is an unofficial national symbol . Its not to be confused with the Harp which is our official national emblem and also not to be confused with a four leafed clover . Shamrock is a common three leafed clover , the four leafed version is said to be lucky because its harder to find. - The three leaves of the shamrock were used to symbolize the Holy Trinity by St. Patrick . On March 17th , people typically pin a small bunch of shamrock on their lapel or hat .

Not because I received negativity but because I received support . I am aware that seems incredibly cynical and negative . I was finally able to share the pregnancy journey with those who seemed concerned , interested and happy for me . I can not describe the feeling of going through such a special time and being the only one invested in it .

The type of anticipation Ive never experienced and I 'm an anxious person ! Time both flies and stands still and although you expect a baby , you do n't  yet have a baby so you have a lot of time alone with your thoughts . While ruminating on worries and fears is n't good for you at this time , it is a great time to get ready and research some of those things everyone whose ever been pregnant is telling you . <p> So you and google sit for many hours together building your skill-set for motherhood . With weeks to go you 've got this ! You 're ready for the explosion of love . You 're ready to be awake for the rest of your life . You 're ready to hold your little bundle and be everything she needs . You 're ready for the towering laundry and messier home . <p> But here 's the thing <p> No . You . Are n't  . <p> The reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NOTHING can prepare you for the impending shift in your head , your heart , your home your life . <h> Birth <p> I was lucky enough to have an amazing , positive birth experience despite having to undergo a c-section for a scary reason . Whether your birth is memorable for being amazing , traumatic or just miraculous in general it is a life altering experience and I 'm not sure the roller coaster of emotion connected to it can ever be written down and communicated effectively . <h> The Love <p> Oh , the love . Indescribable , earth shattering love . How something so little can reduce you to such mush is beyond my comprehension . You created perfection and the wave of awe is quite overwhelming . I would look at my baby with tears in my eyes for the first few weeks . I could not look at her without crying or wanting to . I 'm sure hormones had something to do with that also <h> Sleep Deprivation <p> We all know . We KNOW new parents ( and seasoned parents ) get no sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evil . Exhaustion makes you think horrible things , have a short temper and overall be the more gremlin version of your usual self . If sleep is for the weak then I 'm waving my white flag . I AM WEAK . There is no shame in craving your sleep with a newborn . You can not pour from an empty cup and with a newborn your cup is usually very empty . Except your coffee cup , that 's always full of the coffee you no longer get to finish ! <h> Breastfeeding <p> For me , this was the biggest shock to the system even over the loss of all sleep . I was not prepared , not remotely and this came out of nowhere and threw my whole world upside down . I thought I had researched it to a tee . To this day I am struggling with it but determined to persevere . Nursing is exhausting , especially at the beginning . It drained the life and soul out of me and made me feel like a total failure . I am not ashamed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was led to believe it would be . <h> The Loss of Yourself <p> Let me be clear here . Missing who you were does not make you selfish . It makes you a human struggling with change . When a newborn hits your home like a tornado and pjs , no make-up and four day old topknots become your new look it can be very overwhelming . You start to feel like you exist only to sustain your child and clean . It is pure survival mode with little else to spare and it can make you very , very sad . Do not feel guilty for mourning the loss of your old life . <h> Time <p> Savor every second because the time flies . Cliche or sad , terrifying reality ? Both ! I feel like I am outside my body looking at someone holding down a fast forward button while watching mine and babys life play out on screen . It will make you sad to see how quickly your baby grows up . It is of course wonderful to see them develop but equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So my advice is to STOP preparing to be ready for it all . Because you just never will . You can do the legwork for motherhood but it takes that baby in your arms to really activate your inner Mama Bear . That 's when the real learning begins . And its powerful . <p> I 've had this Motherhood gig for just over 12 weeks now , I do n't  claim to know it all . In fact most days I feel like a complete and utter failure . If ever there was anything to etch away at your self esteem its a newborn baby . For the most part the inside of my head is an abyss of self doubt . <p> Did I do that right ? Is she getting enough food ? Is that pain because of the way I fed her ? Did she just drink bath water ? Great now she 's choking on it . <p> The first few weeks were hard , I have no shame in admitting how much I struggled ( let me clarify that I was NO less grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions to process . I was drowning in depression , completely overwhelmed with the new work load , incredibly guilty for all of that but also bursting with love for my newborn baby . How is that possible all at once ? <p> I was surviving not thriving and it was making me so sad that by being so preoccupied with the negative was making me miss that time with my baby . By the time all my family help was gone and it was just me and her , things got better . That 's not to say that help wasnt productive or required it was . It was just coincidental that at that time my fog lifted and I found my feet as a mother . Since then we have been BFFs and I love every moment of Motherhood . <p> During my most difficult times in the early days the smallest things would have helped me a lot but I just was n't thinking clearly .

WHY do teeny tiny newborn outfits have real buttons , not even snaps , real life buttons ? ! So silly ! For the first few weeks try to find snap onesies or sleep suits with zips . <h> Dressing Down <p> Utilize the shoulder flaps on bodysuits . Most babies are not fans of pulling stuff over their heads . Plus you 're being mindful of the soft spots . Roll the onesie downward and even pull it up that way . Also , roll it down in the event of any poop-splosion ! <h> Stock-Take <p> The moment you come home from an outing with baby re-stock the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALWAYS make sure there 's a spare onesie , outfit and pair of socks replaced after use .

Even while nursing , use bibs to catch spit-up and save the outfit . I do this not because I 'm so fussy that the outfit might get dirty but because it saves a ton of laundry and prevents those adorable little outfits from shrinking due to excessive washing . Unfortunately no bib or burp cloth can prevent what may or may not come out the other end <h> Puke Prevention <p> Change baby before feeding . Yes I know , I know baby may need a fresh diaper right after feeding but if he/she does n't  then you do n't  have to put them flat down and risk throwing it all back up . <p> New babies are hard work ! However , nothing can compare to the joy they bring . If you 're drowning in overwhelm do n't  be afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavailable then sit back and leave the dishes dirty and the floor unwashed .

Clue : it did n't  . <p> At 37 weeks and 5 days pregnant I went in for one of my last routine prenatal check-ups only to find that baby was coming via c-section later that SAME day . Luckily I had tentatively packed my bags but there was still an element of surprise I was sure I 'd never experience . When you 're in shock like that , even adding the remaining 3 or 4 unpacked items can seem like a huge challenge . I mean , who is in the frame of mind right then to pack intelligently ? I was n't . Although I did curl my hair because , insanity <p> I arrived at the hospital three bags in tow . I left babys bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me a small tote containing the few essentials I would need for waiting . Because waiting is never fun . In that bag I had my tablet , phone charger , camera and personal essentials like lip balm , hand cream , hair ties , clips etc . Mistake number one ! I did n't  need that bag . I was admitted at 3.45pm , gowned by 3.50pm and by 4.45 I was being prepped for surgery ! That bag turned into an inconvenience that had to be looked after at the nurses station and despite the fact that I was about to have major surgery and meet my baby , I was worrying about my belongings being safe . <p> Fast forward one hour . I was wheeled out of the OR , into a recovery unit where I spent another hour being prodded , poked and watched for surgical complications . Once I was sent to my room , I relaxed . I met my nurse , took my pain medication and settled into the worlds comfiest bed with baby in my arms . WE STAYED LIKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my entire stay , they were far more convenient for skin-to-skin and feeding . Baby wore a diaper the entire time as she was skin-to-skin practically the whole stay . She was swaddled in hospital blankets and literally the ONLY thing she used that I brought was a hat ( the hospital also supplied me with 3 ) . In fact , the hospital supplied me with EVERYTHING . Diapers , wipes , blankets , hats , nasal aspirator , bath wash , wash cloths , hair brush , you name it it was there . I was so happy but also kicking myself for agonizing over the bag of goodies I had packed . Not to mention , baby was only 5lbs 11oz and to this day still hardly fits into anything I brought with me . I used nothing but deodorant and my toothbrush until I was going home when I got dressed for the first time ! The hospital provided me with all of my recovery essentials including random stuff like body wash , fluffy socks and other toiletries . <p> Long story short , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to labor &amp; delivery with nothing but my handbag . Well not literally but I will be going full minimalist ! <h> What I 'd Bring The Second Time Around <p> Boppy Pillow <p> Baby Going Home Outfit <p> Mom Going Home Outfit <p> 1 Muslin Swaddle Blanket <p> 1 Newborn Hat <p> Basic toiletries <p> Camera <p> I mean it , that 's it ! <p> What was your hospital stay like ? Were you given everything or left to fend for yourself ? <p> Long time , no post my friends ! Its been 8 joyful ( and exhausting ) weeks of being a mother and I was long overdue a new post . I planned on taking a month long blog break ( HA ! ) but evidently I overestimated my abilities to juggle it all . Motherhood has been the steepest learning curve of my life but I would n't change it for the world . My crafty side has been twitching from being so stagnant and today I 'm bringing you this adorable DIY name project . Put your own spin on it and add the sweetest personal touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should , should n't I ? I spent nine long months agonizing over what it might be and hopefully she likes it just as much ! Im amazed by the amount of people who have n't heard the name before . In case you have n't heard of it , here 's a little background . <p> I always wanted to display the babys name in the nursery but was n't sure how . I 'm not a huge fan of letters hanging from the wall individually and since there are six of them in hers I was n't too wild about six permanent holes in my already terrible walls ! If you search baby name craft on Pinterest you will be able to scroll for hours through wood letter craft . Some of them were just too well , pinterest for me . I wanted something elegant and dainty yet without fuss . <p> To the craft store ! The best part of this was the fact that I bought everything I needed for under $15 ! I decided on scrapbook paper to decorate . Rather than sticking to one pattern I got four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Making the name was easy as pie . I simply drew around the letters on my paper of choice , carefully cut out the shape ( using a sharp scissors ! ) then mod podged it to the wood . Done ! <p> Initially , I was going to display the letters simply . I purchased a narrow frame shelf on Amazon with the intention of propping them up against the wall but I ( horribly ) misjudged the length of the name and size of the shelf and so that was nixed . The shelf now displays some of her prettiest books in what turned into a happy accident ! In the end I chose to arrange the letters in a fun design and glue them together before hanging the name as one piece . I absolutely love how it turned out ! <h> Did you do any nursery craft ? Feel free to share in the comment section = <p> Since I have had the ability to read , I have been a bookworm . While reading seems to be a love it or hate it pastime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As well as something to do , reading allows one to escape the banal , live other lives and learn without limitation . There are many things I want for my daughter , one of which is to instill the same love of reading that her Dad and I have . To see Isolde enjoying books will make my heart so happy . In fact , some of the first things I bought for babys room , while pregnant , were books ! <p> This post is in partnership with I See Me- Books . I received this book free of charge in exchange for my honest review . <h> How To Nurture A Baby Bookworm <h> Read bedtime stories <p> Reading to newborns has been linked to early speech development , wider vocabularies and better listening and communication skills . Aside from setting your child up for these benefits , some quiet story time with baby can be a lovely bonding experience . <h> Create a cozy reading nook <p> There 's something satisfying about having your own quiet space to curl up with your book , young kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores <p> You do n't  necessarily need to buy a book each time but make visiting the book store a fun treat . Is there anything more exciting than a child asking to check out the new releases ? ! <h> Join your local library <p> Books can be expensive . Especially new releases ! Visit the library and choose from thousands of titles for free or a nominal annual membership fee . Usually the childrens section also offers fun arts and crafts activities and story telling events . <h> Start a seasonal book buying tradition <p> Whether they are new titles or pre-loved , start a tradition of acquiring a book for each season/event . St. Patricks Day , Easter , - Independence Day , Christmas etc . Its a great way to learn about the origins of the holidays while still having fun . Growing up I would also get a new book before vacations or as a gift on vacation . <h> Read a book about them ! <p> Isolde at just 4 weeks old , was lucky enough to be gifted with another book to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incredibly special . It is a a personalized book from I See Me which is all about her . I adore it and I hope she will too . There is something so special about customized books in which the individual child is the protagonist of the story . <p> Since I met her Dad , we have traveled all over Europe and the United States and so the book Its Fancy To Be Me was the perfect choice . In the book , Isolde travels around the world experiencing the traditional dress and unique cultures of the places she visits . It is the sweetest story with gorgeous illustrations ! <p> The best part of the book is that the illustrations can be customized to have your childs hair/eye/skin color making for total customization . As well as this , her full name and date of birth is included in the first page along with a dedication of your choosing . <p> I am already planning my next purchase from I See Me for both Isolde and gifts for others . I was impressed with the quality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as books , you can also purchase adorable puzzles , lunch boxes and growth charts . If Isolde is anything like me she will be a puzzle master = <p> Baby arrived unexpectedly three days prior to posting but more on that later ! * <p> It is almost baby time , people ! I cant believe it , we are just days ( hopefully not weeks ! ) away from meeting baby ! On that note , I 'll be taking a month off from blogging to learn how to mom but will be active on social media and hopefully reappear here some time in May . As I reflect on my pregnancy I wanted to share with you some of my maternity photos . Over Presidents Day weekend we took a trip to Charleston where I had a surprise babymoon/maternity photo shoot thanks to my husband ! From the start , I had always wanted to do maternity photos but it was one of those things I kept putting off for a multitude of reasons . <p> We drove the short two hour drive to Charleston that Friday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savannah and not visiting sooner ! Downtown Charleston oozes charm and sophistication . It is the gastronomic capital of the South and has all the fun of the seaside just a stones throw away . It really is the perfect city for everyone whether you want a family vacation , romantic getaway or girls weekend ! <p> Our first stop before the city was Folly Beach , a popular vacation spot just outside Charleston . We met the lovely Melissa of Oakley Photography and had a 2 hour session with her . My maternity shoot was my first ever photo shoot besides my wedding photos . I was so hesitant to have maternity photos taken because I feel a constant state of awkwardness ! Well none of that mattered . Melissa is down to earth , funny and manages to make you feel so at ease . She knows exactly what shes doing and has a great eye for flattering shots . I couldnt be happier with my photos , its been a while since I felt that pretty and she made it happen effortlessly . <p> There 's something pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos exude exactly how I feel about that ! <p> Whether its your first baby or your fifth , newborns come with overwhelmingly long to-do lists ! When you are entirely preoccupied with everything you must do to prepare for babys arrival , its easy to forget the monotonous things that still need tending to in our day to day lives . Who wants to have a newborn baby , be overwhelmed by motherhood and realize you have to go to the store for toilet paper ? Not this gal ! With just a couple of weeks left before babys arrival , I 'm sharing with you a list of things to get done that you will either have no time nor desire to do once baby arrives . <h> Your Hair ! <p> This one is n't the most important , I admit , but you deserve some pampering mama ! Its not easy waddling around feeling super uncomfortable 24/7 . Get your hair done and relish your glamorous locks before they 're full of spit up on the regular . Not to mention , finding 2-3 hours for a hair appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and important one would be to visit the dentist . Did you know that women are far more susceptible to dental problems during pregnancy ? Now is the time for a check-up or even just a clean . Who knows when you might get time to go again . <h> Make Lists <p> This is the crazy organized part of me shining through . I have compiled a list of family and friends numbers who we want to share the news of babys arrival with immediately . This helps to avoid forgetting someone when you 're running on endorphins and wont exactly be thinking of Uncle so and so who then gets super offended that he saw it on facebook . So make a list or yknow , tell everyone online and offend them all equally . Whatever your view is , its your baby ! <p> A perhaps more achievable list to compile is a list of recipients for your Thank You cards as you receive registry gifts . I did n't  have a baby shower but we were still flooded with gifts from family and friends . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sent you something . Rude ! Even if you do n't  do it as they arrive , be sure to send a birth announcement card with a thank you from baby attached . <h> Deep Clean <p> And by deep clean , I mean have your ever-so-gracious and helpful partner do it or hire someone . Do n't  attempt all that bending and scrubbing alone . Have rooms/closets organized , carpets shampooed , windows cleaned and basically any big Spring cleaning kind of task that more than likely will not get done with a newborn around . <p> Since January we have been taking a room or area of the house each week in which to deep clean blinds , window screen ledges , windows and baseboards . My husband has shampooed the carpets and we maintain a twice weekly quick and general cleaning of the whole house to keep it up . <h> Stockpile Household Necessities <p> 2 days postpartum is not the time to find out you have run out of bin liners , toilet paper , disinfectant etc . Have everything stocked up that you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be at the forefront of your mom brain . <p> I went to my local Sams Club and stocked up on TP , paper towels , trash bags , body wash , razor blades , toothpaste , pantry staples such as cereals , pasta , grains , sauces &amp; seasonings and also , a large freezer meat supply ! Im subscribed to diapers and other baby essentials on Amazon Prime so I can rest assured that will be taken care of . Basically all I will need weekly is fresh produce and dairy which my husband can help out with by quickly picking up on the way home from work . <h> Prepare The Car ( + Install Car Seat ) <p> Keep your vehicle pet hair free when babys due date is getting close ! We have an SUV that will be perfect for carting around babys gear but up until now its been the personal Uber car for our Labradoodle . Let 's just say he got WAY more lab than poodle and he sheds like a maniac every February or if he s just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car seat to ensure no floating Doodle hairs end up on the baby . Ew . Poor Darby is now limited to riding in less style in my husbands commute-to-work car . But he does n't  mind once he ends up at the park , the beach or his friend Olafs house ! <h> Prepare Freezer or Crockpot-Ready Meals <p> This one takes effort but oh goodness will it be worth it when you 're so tired you could crumple in a heap and cry ! I 'm a big supporter of the crockpot . That glorious device that I dump stuff into and can magically eat 8 hours later . Set aside an evening to plan your meals . Then spend a morning shopping for ingredients and the rest of the day assembling . Again , request help with this one . This is definitely a task where many hands make light work . Stock up on freezer bags and get to it . Itll be so satisfying to see your meals for a solid month or more all taken of ! You will be less tempted to order fast food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for new mothers , especially if nursing your baby . <h> Bonus + Often Overlooked Task ! <h> Make Arrangements for Pet Care <p> This gives me the most anxiety . Babies are n't  exactly known for their perfect , convenient arrival times on their exact due date . Were lucky to have the worlds best puppy sitter ! Shes flexible and ever so good to the Dood . Ensure you have someone lined up to take care of your pet . Decide whether they will take them to their place or stay at yours . These plans will be loose until the big day . Most people are understanding about the unknowns in this situation . <p> Here I am at 36 weeks pregnant . Yes six weeks have passed since my last update , it feels like I just blinked and February was suddenly over . I 'm officially in the 9th month of my pregnancy and it could very well even be baby month ! Its a little bittersweet . Although I have been through the general worries that come with pregnancy , I have enjoyed this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . I have had it pretty easy , medically , and honestly have n't yet thought I am so sick of being pregnant ! . I think I 'm going to be of those annoying women who whines about missing their bump ! <p> This post may contain affiliate links <p> Something I did struggle with and still do in my pregnancy is some emotional issues that go beyond raging hormones . Needless to say , depression and stress are not good for baby . Today , as well as a quick pregnancy update I want to share with you some of my absolute self care lifesavers in these final weeks . Now , more than ever , is the time to get all the sleep you can to help that baby pack on the pounds ! Its also your final time just being you . Alone . Kind of scary , huh ? A little guilt free indulgence is just what the doctor ordered ! <h> Boppy Pregnancy Wedge <p> I bought this rather late , probably around week 28 but it has been so good for supporting the bump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch . <h> Essential Oil Diffuser <p> Give me all of the calming lavender oil ! I love my diffuser and its really fun to create new blends . I 'm not an essential oil expert by any means but its an interesting new world to me ! Just make sure the oils you are using are n't  harmful to your pregnancy . <h> Back Support <p> I admit I do n't  use this daily but if I have some chores to do or anything that involves standing for a little longer than I 'm used to this is a life saver ! It takes the pressure off my abdomen and also my lower back . There are far more expensive ( and probably much higher quality ) ones than this but for my needs its perfect . <h> Glam Glow Super-Mud Clearing Treatment <p> This ones for sure an indulgence ! I have problematic skin since I was 13 years old and pregnancy has wreaked even more havoc . This is the only glow in my third trimester . I 'm pretty certain while the mask is on I can almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gross but satisfying . I 'm not usually one for cult beauty products but for me , this really works . <h> Compression Socks <p> As well as long road trips , I did some international travel during my second trimester so compression socks were a must for my circulation during my flights . If you 're on your feet all day , I highly suggest donning a pair of these . They are also recommended during c-section recovery if that happens to be on the cards for you . <h> Measured Water Bottle <p> After becoming dehydrated a few times I got very serious about my water intake . It is so important for baby . I drink three of these per day and the reason I can do that is thanks to the marked measurements . I drink a certain amount by a certain time of day and by 8pm I 'm confident I have satisfied my water intake ! <h> Body Pillow <p> From the start a body pillow seemed like a pointless expense . Enter the third trimester ! YOU . NEED . THIS . Sleep is fleeting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some . <h> Burts Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter <p> I used this from day one . I 'm sure its more down to my body type and the fact that I 'm very slight but so far I have no stretch marks . I apply this to my belly and chest after a shower and again before bed . It does n't  react in any negative way and leaves my skin feeling so soft ! <h> 36 Weeks Pregnancy Update <p> According to the app , at 36 weeks baby is the size of a honeydew melon ! Baby weighs close to 6 lbs and is around 18.5 inches long . <p> Total weight gain <p> 24 lbs <p> Maternity clothes <p> Living in leggings and flowy tees ! Maternity jeans are my BFF on weekends as well as soft jersey midi dresses ! <p> Stretch marks <p> None and happy to get to 36 weeks without any but I wo n't mind too much if I still do . <p> Sleep <p> I 'm really struggling to fall asleep these past few weeks . Sticking to sleeping on my left side makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ok once I actually fall asleep but getting there is so difficult . Its often well past 2am before I get to sleep . I feel exhausted all the time but trying not to nap as it makes falling asleep even more difficult . <p> Longing for <p> All the sweets , soft drinks and caffeine in the world . I guess cravings only hit me in the third trimester ! I 'm doing well with not giving in to every craving . Sodas are not consumed , coffee is only allowed once a week and sweets are kept to a minimum ! <p> Movement <p> Baby is pretty cramped in there now so feeling jabby little stretches and pokes rather than the previous full body flips I had been feeling . It seems the baby has the hiccups often though which is a rather strange sensation . Sometimes it continues for ages . <p> Out as much as it will be . Still doing its weird half and half thing and still freaking me out . <p> Wedding rings on or off ? <p> On and still wrestling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring weather . <p> Happy or moody ? <p> Anxious , which more often than not leads to moodiness over happiness ! <p> Looking forward to <p> Installing the car seat , placing my bags by the door and setting up some baby gear around the house . Its suddenly very real . It will feel even more real when my family visits later in the month . I cant wait to hear an Irish accent = <p> Not another hospital bag post , you cry ! Yes . I 'm not even sorry because reading so many helped me immensely ! Way back in December , I had a slight baby scare which thankfully turned out fine ! Being so unprepared for the hospital frightened me into seriously thinking about packing my hospital bag at just week 24 . Since then , it was not fully packed but I made it my priority to buy and organize what I needed . This week ( at 34 weeks ) I finally packed it along with the changing bag for baby . <p> After reading quite literally EVERY what to pack article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended hospital bag essentials along with the things I deem applicable to me . <p> Conscious that a c-section might be a possibility , I have packed enough for a more extended stay than most women will have .

At 34 weeks pregnant , I am feeling lethargic , anxious and less than attractive . One sure fire way to improve my mood when I 'm feeling down is to dress myself up . Dressing up while eight months pregnant however , is no easy task . You are more than likely bored stiff of wearing whatever still fits you . Cue Pink Blush and their vast selection of gorgeous maternity dresses . <p> This post was in partnership with Pink Blush . As always , all opinions are my own . <p> I wanted something feminine and comfortable to serve me throughout the rest of my pregnancy in a warm Georgia Spring . I was also keen to find something that could be worn postpartum for easy nursing . None of us are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shop for dresses to suit my frame as I am 6 feet tall . Short dresses on me could be deemed a criminal offense and typically , maxi dresses sit somewhere in the middle of my shins hot stuff ! So for me , finding the perfect midi dress is like hitting the jackpot . <p> To flatter the bump and to suit babys nursing needs , I chose this hi-lo style midi number . Nothing says Goodbye , Winter ! like a pretty floral print and a little big of leg ! I instantly fell in love with the dress that ticked all the boxes . This dress not only showcases the bump adorably but also hides a multitude of sins and is SO comfortable . That equates to the trifecta of cute maternity clothes in case you did n't  know ! <p> I noticed the companys tagline is Effortless styles for the modern mother and theyve certainly got it right . Pregnancy clothes are typically NOT cute , let 's be honest !

I definitely agree with you about the hair tools-I have been contemplating bringing them for pictures but I think I will just rock natural curls ! <p> This is such a great guide ! As a mom I agree on the no leggings , they were such a pain for me . I stayed in dresses/nightgowns well after I left the hospital . <p> When I was packing for my delivery , I read somewhere to take some hard candy/mints to help with dry mouth . I did n't  pay too much attention but did throw some jolly ranchers in my purse . In the hospital my mouth was so dry and I drank so much water my doc literally told me to stop drinking water lol . Those hard candies came in handy SO MUCH ! <p> lol i think we took really similar things , I 'm like you i was not going to spend 50 box on a hospital gown when i can use the one from the hospital lol . Especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a pillow when the hospital has theirs . I took yoga pants but you are so right i wore the hospital gown all through my stay , i just kept changing them . They are always coming to run tests and look down there so it was a lot easier in the yoga pants ! great guide ! <p> OH my gosh ! A DRESS to go home in ! ! ! WHOA ! I 'm on baby number four and NEVER thought of that ! ! ! ! This one will be in June too ( all the rest in the cold months ) a dress is BRILLIANT ! ! ! <p> I 'd also suggest an extra bag ( or storage cube ) if you have lots of family and friends around , we wished we had something extra with our first one to bring ALL of the GIFTS home ! ! ! We went home with about 3 times as much as we went in with . = <p> Even for packing sake a dress is so easy !

It turned out great and I had the right amount items ! = <p> Very great list ! My hospital bag has changed with each baby . For the first one , the hospital staff probably thought we were moving in . We brought everything ! I ended up having to stay for 5 days so we used a lot , but the logistics of getting everything into the car was not easy . We brought way less with our second baby and I got to go home the following morning .

@@48796305 @2296305/ <p> There 's always one . In every situation , pregnant or not there is always one negative person who has nothing positive to say on the matter . In pregnancy , the same applies . Whether its strangers patting your belly or unsolicited advice , there 's plenty of negativity to fill your nine months and beyond . <p> I was home in Ireland briefly and sadly , I kind of regret going . Not because I received negativity but because I received support . I am aware that seems incredibly cynical and negative . I was finally able to share the pregnancy journey with those who seemed concerned , interested and happy for me . I can not describe the feeling of going through such a special time and being the only one invested in it . So I wont even try but it was very hard to leave a loving , familiar environment and return to one void of such happiness . <p> I have come to discover here that when I am in the company of others , all I hear regarding my pregnancy is what will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last post about struggling with my mental health throughout this pregnancy . The last thing any expectant first-time mother wishes to hear is what they are doing wrong or what will go wrong . It baffles me that at such a special time in life , the only sentiments offered are negative . With all due respect if you have nothing nice to say , then say nothing . <p> I understand that some people do n't  worry . I am a sensitive , intuitive person and worry comes with the territory . Do n't  get me wrong , I am confident in this pregnancy . If it werent for the external factors I would say I am loving it . But I have the normal apprehension that is to be expected when facing delivering your first baby . Fortunately , in my battalion I also have my intelligence , a strong maternal instinct and a drive to succeed . Maybe I internalize too much but I can not bear someone treating me like I know absolutely nothing . Condescending comments that almost infer I have n't held , cared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negativity about the way I eat , drink or choose to care for myself during the gestation . Telling me with a loud cackle how my house will never be the palace it is now , again . UGH . <h> Like snowflakes , fingerprints and pregnancies we are all unique . <p> Why is it so hard to live and let live ? In my rant I have digressed . I have taken too long to realize that the health and well-being of myself and my child trumps literally everything else in my life . Giving these people power over your emotions is the worst way to manage . You must continue on boldly and bravely in your pregnancy . You are the mother . That intuition is strong for a reason . You know what is best for you and for baby . Embrace the positivity you receive . Be thankful for those people and their kind words , generosity and support . Give them the space in your head and heart . <h> Dealing With Negative Nancy During Your Pregnancy <p> Bite your tongue <p> Smile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you do not wish to discuss certain topics if they are too personal or invasive <p> Do n't  focus on the fact that your boundaries are being disrespected and allow it to become bitterness . Some people just truly believe they know everything <p> Try to remember that to them the advice is coming from a good place and not one of malice <p> Do n't  internalize it as condescension , often empty vessels simply make the most noise <p> Initially , the thoughts of a maternity wardrobe horrified me which is strange because I love fashion , shopping and everything related . It was n't the fact that I would need bigger clothes . Or the effort of shopping for them but simply the fact that if you stick the word maternity in front of any item of clothing it seems to triple in price . The sting in that is the amount of time you will actually spend wearing these pieces . It is so short ! So in my pregnancy ignorance I assumed I would get away with leggings and my loose tunic style tops for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't going to happen . My bump is still teeny tiny but I am rocking the maternity jeans a good few weeks now . Undershirts have become weird belly tops and button down tops no longer button . <p> With that , I have started to pick up a few key pieces that are versatile enough to build different outfits around . Think essential basics like leggings , tanks , long tees , tunics , casual jersey dresses and layering items like shirts , cardigans and blanket scarves . <p> Luckily I will be spending my pregnancy sporting Winter gear . I can not imagine being pregnant in the height of a Georgia Summer , ick . However , Winter really only arrives here in January so there is no need for heavy coats and huge sweaters . With upcoming trips to Ireland and Huntsville , I will need some cold weather attire occasionally but I hope to pull this off by layering basics with chunky cardigans already in my wardrobe ! <p> Comfort is the winner for me with style taking a close second . Here are some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in total comfort and the height of style = <h> BASIC TOPS <p> I would suggest buying these in white , grey and black or multiples of whichever your favorite color is ! These are perfect for layering . Wear under sweaters , kimonos , cardigans , blazer etc . I love the longer length to cover the waistband of my jeans/leggings . If you are still doing the hair-tie trick with your pants , they are perfect for hiding that too ! <h> SWEATERS &amp; LAYERING <p> None of these are maternity pieces which I love because you 'll wear them long after baby arrives . Kimonos are light and airy and look great over leggings for a relaxed but dressed up look . I LOVE this plaid kimono , get your Autumn plaid shirt fix without battling buttons . Chunky knitwear is a no brainer when it comes to layers so it needs no explanation . How cute is this layered sweater ? Its also peplum which means you can wear it without the bump stretching it out ! Win ! <h> BOTTOMS <p> Maternity jeans and a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely lived in throughout your entire pregnancy . I was lucky enough to get a 40% off any single item code for H&amp;M which allowed me to pick up these jeans for a steal . Overalls/dungarees are a love or hate maternity piece but I adore this skinny legged pair ! <h> DRESSES <p> If dresses are your style then they will be your splurge item . However if you find a casual dress that can take you from day to night then it will be an worthwhile investment ! Add a wide brim hat and chunky statement jewelry to dress these basic dresses up ! I personally would pair dress #4 with denim leggings and over the knee boots as I do n't  like bare legs with knit dresses but to each their own . <h> Check out my Bump Style Pinterest board for ways to wear similar styles <p> If you follow the blogs social media accounts and saw my previous post , Little Pumpkin then you will already know that we are expecting ! Baby Scott arrives next Spring and we are so flippin excited ! Ive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do all that I can to help other women deal with morning sickness misery ! " Not another post about morning sickness ! " , I hear you cry . There are endless morning sickness remedies out there . How do I know how many there are ? Because I searched for them ALL . I read them all and I tried them all . Some worked wonders , other made me worse so I 've compiled a list of what kept me at my best during my worst ! Hopefully they can help you too . <p> Intuitively , I knew I would experience morning sickness . Its me . Everything turns my stomach , even at full health . I have a high pain tolerance but the weakest stomach and I was anxious in the early weeks of my pregnancy awaiting the dreaded nausea . I was 7 weeks 3 days at my initial prenatal exam and first ultrasound . The nurse asked me how I was feeling and I was on top of the world . She mused that I might be one of the lucky ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The very next day I woke up to the room spinning , stomach growling and vomit rising in my throat . T.M.I ? Get used to it . Pregnancy and dignity do n't  go hand in hand I 've found . <p> I was floored and it was a vicious cycle . I was feeling deathly sick but starving at the same time . Let 's face it the last thing you want when you are sitting on bathroom floor waiting to vomit is a big meal . I learned my lesson quickly though . The reason I was feeling so sick was because I needed food . I needed to eat something the second I woke up and last thing at night . As well as this , I needed to eat frequently to avoid any sensation of hunger which in turn equated to nausea . <h> My Top 6 Morning Sickness Musts <p> Eat immediately upon waking and right before bedtime . In the morning I found a dry , crunchy granola bar would give me enough energy and tide me over while I was getting myself up and dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At night time I would eat the same but maybe add a banana . This was enough to fill me in case I woke in the middle of the night . <p> Eat every 2 to 3 hours . This sounds excessive but for me it was the only way I got through my morning-noon-night sickness . I would eat at 9am , 12pm , 2/3pm , 5pm , 7pm and 9/10pm . Some of these were meals ( whatever I could keep down ) and the rest were light , dry and downright boring snacks . Meals consisted of A LOT of carbohydrates and other plain but filling foods . Bread , rice , pasta , cereals etc . Snacks were crackers , granola bars , oatmeal and fruits that I could stomach like bananas , blueberries and strawberries . <p> Do n't  skip on water . I know , I know , its impossible to drink liters of water while feeling so awful . I added a teaspoon of the juice of a fresh lemon to every bottle of water I drank to add some flavor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I slacked on my water intake were hell . My head spun and the nausea was undoubtedly stronger . Not to mention the most important factor all those fluids are necessary for babies development ! <p> Brew your own ginger tea . I both won and lost here . Who knew you could overdose on ginger ? Not this girl . Its rough . Trust me . I was so sick one day that I boiled the kettle , grated some fresh ginger and made my own tea . Grate your ginger into a bowl and pour hot water on top . Let it steep for a few minutes . Strain this water into a cup over a teaspoon of honey and a teaspoon of lemon then add more warm water . The key here is to not use too much ginger , a bare half teaspoon of grated ginger is enough . I used too much ! The tea settled my stomach and I felt really good but the next two days were not pleasant . I had sent my body into a full digestive detox/cleanse and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put your go-to snacks EVERYWHERE . In the glove box of the car , in every handbag you own , in every pocket of your clothing , on your nightstand , on your coffee table , etc . Sometimes just walking to the pantry to get my food made the world spin . I liked to have things on hand at all times . <p> Something I struggled with during the worst weeks of sickness was the gross metallic taste in my excessively dry mouth . I tried sucking on glassy , fruity candy but was overwhelmed by sweetness . I recommend ginger candies just for the purpose of settling the stomach but the taste can become overpowering . What worked best for me in the end was peppermints and occasionally chewing gum . Chewing gum helps to produce more saliva and I find it takes my mind off the i 'll feeling . <p> As I said my sickness began at week 7 . It peaked at week 10 and by the very end of week 11 it became far more manageable . By the time week 12 rolled around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inkling of illness , which is typical of nearing the second trimester . The only time I feel sick now is if I allow myself to go far too long without eating . I really hope some of these tips work for someone else out there because it can feel downright hopeless and miserable . <p> Autumn is finally , officially here and while everyones talking about all pumpkin everything , I 've been keeping a tiny pumpkin of my own a big secret ! <h> WERE HAVING A BABY ! <p> Did I get to the point quick enough ? I feel like I could burst with relief from keeping it quiet for so long !

We have travelled a lot but travelling sane always becomes a challenge . We never stand in queue for boarding we either board on priority as we have a baby or wait till everyone else has boarded .

@@48796309 @2296309/ <p> When I first started blogging I did n't  even consider my niche . I just wrote about what I was doing , my current situation , things that were of interest to me at that time , etc . I quickly discovered that to promote and connect with fellow bloggers my blog needed to have some type of niche in order to reach like-minded bloggers . I struggled with this definition for the first month . I was Irish , newly married and recently emigrated to the US . I liked fashion , food and travel but did n't  want my blog to be categorized so narrowly under any of these things . Getting my head around that mish-mash of interests and circumstances was hard for me and I found it difficult to , as the saying now goes , find my tribe . I came to accept that my blog is a lifestyle blog that focuses on a healthy mix of all of the above . But what 's more important is that I stopped worrying about fitting in and just continued writing . You will read a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking to your niche and while that is necessary in business , if you are blogging for fun then my response to that is , " who said so ? ! " <p> After publishing posts consistently and learning what my viewers liked the most I started to settle into my own blog and became more confident when hitting publish . I was never overly confident that the content was good but happy with what I was saying and HOW I was saying it . Although you strive to give your readers what they want , it is of the utmost importance to write what YOU want , too . Your viewers have come to your site because they like you and your content , they will return if they love it . If they leave , so be it . More will come . <p> As I said in my last post , I have seen people switch niches a lot . There 's many reasons for going beyond the limits of your niche . Perhaps you are after getting bogged down in an area you no longer have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , you had a travel blog but are now settling down into motherhood and want to focus on writing articles on parenting . Or you have been blogging about college life but are now entering the working world . There 's an array of reasons to re-brand your blog but there is NEVER a reason to not be true to yourself in your writing . <p> Which brings me back from my tangential rambling to the idea of writing in your voice . Of course I do n't  mean voice in the traditional sense- but the portrayal of your personality through the words you write . You are unique and your writing style should be too . If you are a really funny and bubbly person but write in a monotonous tone with none of the humor you possess naturally then your content will not be authentic . And although we live in a world where we can fake happiness , good fortune and popularity quite easily via social media , your blog will expose a greater portion of yourself to the world . Make that section of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful and people are perceptive beings . Posts repeatedly written in any voice but your own will be transparent and shallow . Your readers will not trust you or your content and wont engage . <p> The first thing I notice when reading blog posts , or any piece of writing for that matter , is the writing style . Now I 'm not saying mine is good . I 'm a serial user of cliches and slang which is considered vulgarity and terrible writing by some ( or most ) . In the world of professional writing I would more than likely be be condemned ! I do strive to improve my writing skills and blogging refreshes a great deal of lessons already learned about writing but when it comes to writing posts I often skip the- rules and mechanics of composing the perfect piece of literature as I try to write them as an exact reflection of myself and what I might say in a discussion with a real life person ! The wit , sarcasm , humor whatever you want to label it is exactly how I converse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are people who like my posts , those who can take or leave them and others whod rather poke out their eyes than read to the bottom . I 'm totally ok with that ! Well I 'd prefer if you held onto your eyes but I 'm fine with you leaving . Not everyone shares the same interests and opinions . <p> The way that I write , is genuine . The feelings I express , are genuine . My sentiments when I comment on your posts , are genuine . Being a genuine person is what I respect the most in any human being . I have no time for any single trait that is a fraction less than honest . <p> When I borderline stalk every social media platform you use , I love your blog ! When I like your pictures , I genuinely like your pictures . When I share your content , I really do think you have a message worth sending out . I like all of these things about you because you have probably won me over by writing in your own voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ havent found your blogging voice yet , ask yourself before publishing is this for the glory of a spike in views , free products , money , etc. ? If the answer is yes to any of the above , then I suggest you save your draft and go back to the drawing board . <p> For those of you pouring your heart and soul into your blog and feeling like you need to start writing as someone else to fit in stop it ! Explore the boundaries of your niche , find new forums to join , freshen up your content but for the love of God , keep writing in your own voice ! <h> If you struggle with finding your voice , what is it about blogging that limits your authenticity ? <p> Get comfortable , you 're in this one for the long haul ! Nothing could have prepared me for the world of blogging . I was under no illusion that it would be easy to consistently post to the website but starting out that was about the extent of my concern . How quickly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shamrocks is 3 months old today ! To be 100% honest ( because I do n't  see the point in being any other way ) , thus far the negative aspects of running this blog outweigh the positives but I 'm optimistic in thinking that wont always be the case . <p> Blogging is EXHAUSTING , it infiltrates your entire day , consumes a great deal of your thoughts and gobbles up vast quantities of your time and energy . In the beginning when I was desperately trying to teach myself how to do everything at once , I skipped meals and hardly slept thankfully it is n't like that anymore . This is the number one stinger for me ; I am a perfectionist . A perfectionist who is excellent at organization but terrible at time management . Instead of separating tasks and adhering to a strict schedule I like to think that I can juggle 50 things simultaneously . I always know exactly what needs to be done but do not have the patience to do them separately . I am slowly learning to complete tasks , one action at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do at once . Blogging has taught me that it takes far less time to compartmentalize than it takes to sort through a huge mass of chaos . Good old fashioned pen and paper lists have become my saviors . <p> One of the first things you will learn about writing a blog and building a following is that you must post consistently . This does not mean that you have to post every single day to keep your viewers interested but you should post on a fairly consistent schedule . Whether it is once , twice or three times a week your subscribers will come to know your posting schedule and expect new content on those days . The key is to post according to your own capabilities , i.e. how much time you have to commit to writing , posting and promoting your work . The other and most important point here is quality . You can post every single day of the year if you wish but realistically how good or unique will those posts be ? Strive to publish your best pieces and if this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not claiming any expertise here and my blog is still in its infancy but I have made these mistakes and posted thrice a week only to churn out utter rubbish . I have since removed content that A ) I did not put my best efforts into B ) Does not fit into my niche C ) Had little to no views/engagement . <p> Which leads me to my next point , write about what you want , using your voice/personality and what is inherently YOU . I post about my personal journey , things that interest me and that are relevant to my life . Through that I connect with like-minded people experiencing the same and building that network is a dream . I have seen blogs start around the same time as mine and have been following their blogging adventure as much as my own . I have seen some shoot to success from day one , I have seen others grow at a snails pace and adapt to their niche as they find their feet in the blogging world just like me . I have even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of again but I have also seen others sell out quickly to affiliate programs and brands that seemed to be nothing to do with their overall blog mission . Monetizing your blog is possible through EXTREME hard graft . Some are lucky and soar almost directly into a financially cushy blog spot , others kill themselves for cents per month . In April I applied ads to my site but the monetization of Sass &amp; Shamrocks was not my reason to launch . I truly write for release , fun and the connections/friendships made along the way . <p> Let me tell- you about some people you will endure experience on your blogging journey . People can be flippin terrible . It is wrong of me to tar a portion of the population with one brush so I 'll illustrate this via anecdotes about actual negative interaction on Sass &amp; Shamrocks . Does anyone have frenemies ? Yknow the ones you thought you left back in high school the types who smile at you in the street but for some reason have an inward distaste for your existence , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see that there are a few lurkers . Facebook insights are revealing . Very revealing . For example , the single person who consistently hides my posts regardless of what they are . The person who hides every post relating to my trip home to Ireland . Baffling considering they could just unlike the page and never have to suffer such awfulness . As a side note here is why these people SHOULD unlike your facebook page by Alyssa ( a gem I 've met through this wild trip ) . <p> Following to unfollow . Frustrating and fruitless ! I am not a mass follower . I follow people in stages , over time on different social media platforms because A ) I like them B ) They fit into my blogs niche . If I do n't  get a follow back , I still follow them after all , I chose to follow them . If however their content no longer interests me or I realize that maybe they do n't  fit into my niche as much as I thought and therefore have no engagement then I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not like the follow for follow mentality where I wake up to 30 new followers who unfollow within 24 hours because I have n't returned the favor . This is n't a game of you scratch my back , I 'll scratch yours . With social medias new and complex algorithms it is not beneficial to follow and have followers who do not interact with you . It damages your reach and you will find yourself and your content buried at the bottom of the popularity pile . More gold I have learned through this experience . <p> Blog comments . This s a source of contention for me for two reasons . The first being negative comments . I 'm all for constructive criticism and debate on my posts but telling me I am stupid and selfish ( yes people take the time to write and publish comments like that ! ) is unnecessary . Not to mention , I am not going to approve such comments and display them on my blog . The second peeve here is comment threads . I participate in forums whereby I read other bloggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you read the post thoroughly and leave a genuine , intelligent comment . The aim of this is to support others blogs , discover new bloggers and build a network . Unfortunately a large amount of participants enter these threads merely for the number of views to be gained ( and I assume , money ) . They use it as a tactic to heighten views and you will find comments on your blog such as " great post , thanks for sharing " or " great tips " only to have spent five minutes writing an essay on theirs while it is evident they did n't  even read yours . Its as disheartening as it is false and a big lesson through this has been learning the importance of genuine engagement on my blog . I just stumbled on this excellent article by Gary Vaynerchuk explaining why your view count and social media popularity really means crap . When I first started blogging , the stats were the be all and end all for me . Now my main aim is connection and genuine interaction . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week to assess where I am going wrong and work on correcting those issues . <p> Plagiarism . My soul hurts as much as my brain does when I see a blog post that is identical to mine days or- just hours after publishing . This has happened to me three times in these past three months . I suffer from writers block often . Evidently so do they since they read posts and regurgitate them on their own websites with no credit . I do n't  have the energy to battle it out with these people . But one in particular was someone who had a massive following . Its incredibly frustrating knowing hundreds of thousands of people are actually reading your content that someone else has hijacked . Where is the integrity ? The blogging world is over-saturated , we all know this but I firmly believe that using our own voices , ideas , opinions etc. can result in something entirely unique . I 've learned there will always be someone lurking , waiting to use your achievements for their own ego boost and the hard part is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetitive , action may be taken and here 's how . <p> That is seriously enough about the negativity in blogging . I find it draining to even talk about it but these are the facts of the last three months . I need to give major props to the positive , warm people I have come to know over the last quarter . I struggle in Georgia to make friends even in a military community . Whether it be cultural differences or the limitations of my visa process , I spent a lot of time on my own . One of the reasons I launched the blog was to put myself out there and open doors to new experiences . That definitely happened and although I have come into direct contact with more negativites than positives , it is the elation of the positive experiences and words of the wonderful , supportive people out there that keep me striving towards something greater . <p> If you want to test out your range of emotions and experience all of them at once I recommend that you start blogging . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is enraging , it is amusing , it is jealous , it is liberal , it is passionate , it is ignorant to list but a few . You are placed in a little corner of the world wide web and given a voice . You can use that voice to inform , help or upset others . You can change a life . I 'm not saying I do but you are in this unique position to be heard which is sometimes difficult to achieve in real life . Sharing this piece of myself is scary but rewarding when someone says " I get it " . You can be as transparent as you like and conversely , as private as you wish . You can be a light or you can be the dark . The most important thing is that you are you . <p> Some days I still want to figuratively , flip over the table that is this blog and say F this crap ! ( *Amy OUT* Obama mic drop , style ) other days I feel like I want to change the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened and lot still has n't  .

@@48796310 @2296310/ <p> Not another hospital bag post , you cry ! Yes . I 'm not even sorry because reading so many helped me immensely ! Way back in December , I had a slight baby scare which thankfully turned out fine ! Being so unprepared for the hospital frightened me into seriously thinking about packing my hospital bag at just week 24 . Since then , it was not fully packed but I made it my priority to buy and organize what I needed . This week ( at 34 weeks ) I finally packed it along with the changing bag for baby . <p> After reading quite literally EVERY what to pack article in existence , I have packed some of the highly recommended hospital bag essentials along with the things I deem applicable to me . <p> Conscious that a c-section might be a possibility , I have packed enough for a more extended stay than most women will have . I have still kept those extra items practical and to a minimum . <h> The Highly Recommended Must-Haves <p> Baby Keepsake Book to get hand/foot prints and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boppy nursing pillow to practice good nursing posture <p> Healthy snacks for after the birth in case the hospital food is truly awful <h> The Basics <p> Packing Cubes ! All hail packing cubes . Seriously , these are packing game changers . Buy a set and never deal with chaotic luggage again ! <p> Basic toiletries <p> Travel hair dryer . I do n't  feel like standing for an hour trying to dry my hair with one of those pathetic hospital/hotel dryers that feels like a small child is blowing on your head . <p> A flattering , soft jersey midi dress for going home in comfort , easeand style . <h> The Will I Need This ? Stuff- ( To Be Left In The Car ! ) <p> Do you get the sense that I 'm an organization over-achiever ? ! Every hospital is different . Some will give you everything you need and others will let you fend for yourself for the most part . At least through extensive research on this , that 's the general consensus . So while many moms tell you point blank what not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at all . <p> This is the stuff I am unsure about and have packed in a tote bag that will stay in the car . If I do need it , my husband can grab it rather than visiting the nearest shops with the worlds most embarrassing shopping list . <p> Extra snacks/drinks in case the hospital food is unbearable <p> Pain relief medication <p> Post-delivery feminine products ( this could be a post of its own and I wont go into the gory details ) <p> Extra onesies in different sizes . Despite buying newborn and 0-3 months in various brands , they all differ . Some look tiny and others look far too big . I do n't  want to take a thousand outfits with me but I would like them to fit baby , whatever size he or she turns out to be . This way I 'll have at least 2/3 outfits that will fit . <h> The Items I 'm NOT Packing <p> My own labor/delivery gown . I 100% plan to deliver baby in the hospital issued gown . I 'm vain but not spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clothing that will most likely end up covered in bodily fluids and newborn gunk . <p> A pillow from home . For the same reasons as above and also because there are about 100 of them on the bed I will be in . <p> Athletic Pants . A lot of women suggest yoga pants or some form of comfy pants for after the birth . While I totally agree with the comfort factor , I understand there will be a LOT of checking down there after baby arrives . I will be in no mood to keep wriggling my way out of leggings for my nurse . Nightgowns it is ! <p> Hair tools . Straighteners , curling irons etc .

@@48796312 @2296312/ <p> I was always aware that babies are expensive little beings but I quickly realized just how expensive . It was an eye-opening experience setting up for baby ! I am so grateful to our families for gifting us the big ticket items like the stroller , car seat , crib etc . Between those gifts , re-purposing furniture , building our own ( thanks husband ) and my own frugality we have managed to set up for baby at a fraction of the real cost . Hopefully this post will give you an eye for a great baby bargain just like I found in many stores . <p> I am not in any way stingy . In fact , I have champagne taste but live with a sparkling water budget . I would definitely call myself frugal . I shop around A LOT and a nose around Goodwill is not beneath me , especially when they carry department store overstock ( OMG ! ) . My favorite stores for great deals are Home Goods , TJ Maxx and- sometimes , one particular Ross near my home . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat but its often luck of the draw with what bargain they may have in stock on the day you 're visiting . This is the perfect excuse to go often ! <h> Where To Find The Best Baby Bargain <h> Goodwill <p> A year ago I walked into my local Goodwill ( my first Goodwill trip ever ) and quickly turned my nose up . I actually said EW . Fast forward to 2016 and while doing a donation drop-off at a brand new store , I gave it another chance and wandered into the baby clothes section . I am hooked ever since ! <p> It hit me pretty quickly that bang in the middle of 4 different Goodwill stores in my locale are two Army installations . Army posts mean families moving in and out of the area constantly . This in turn means families purging their unwanted items often . The presence of military families also means there 's lots of babies around . While many , many adult garments at Goodwill may be ratty and suspect , the baby clothes are in a league of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased a hoard of completely unworn or worn-once onesies and full outfits . My total is usually under $6 and I come away with 6-8 outfits . <p> Honestly , I often feel guilty buying at Goodwill . I feel like I am stealing the eyes out of someones head . They have a color-of-the-week offer which means that if you have a bunch of items on your arm bearing that color plastic barb , then that item is half price . In the infant section , this means your outfit could cost you just 49- ! On Sundays , ALL items with the color-of-the-week tag are 50- . <p> Some of my Goodwill gold includes <p> Enough adorable infant clothing to dress every baby in North America . I will re-donate any items I do n't  end up using . Brands including Ralph Lauren , Tommy Hilfiger , GAP , Janie &amp; Jack , OshKosh , Little Me , Carters and more ( 49-99- per item ) <p> V-Tech Light &amp; Move Learning Ball- that has been thoroughly disinfected and is like brand new ( $1.99 -versus- $14.99 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip on stroller book with a tag on . Both washed like a dream ( 39- each -versus $7-10 ) <h> TJ Maxx <p> Ok , while TJ is one of my favorite stores , it can be as hit and miss as Goodwill . Their inventory changes constantly so if you spot something you have to snap it up there and then . I promise you it wont be there next week , or even later that day . I have found so many baby items at a fraction of the cost and though most of their stock is passed season or slightly flawed , some of what I got is still this current seasons styles and prints . Have a good look at something you like in case it is damaged ( it probably is n't ) and put it in your cart pronto ! Sometimes the flaw and reason an item is there is a tiny as a seam sewn off center . If you are n't  fussy , you will never even notice . <h> Marshalls <p> At Marshalls you will find similar things to TJ or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need at one , be sure to check the other . <h> Ross <p> I do n't  shop here very often . In fact I have purchased something from a Ross store only twice . This past weekend I was looking for something specific so I perused my local and nicest Ross ! I did n't  buy one because I have one already but they had Boppy Nursing pillows for $24 ! Granted , it was n't the cutest slipcover they make but those bad boys retail for $39.99 ! <p> I did buy a large faux sheepskin area rug for babys room for $30 versus the $60+ Ive seen elsewhere ! <h> Home Goods <p> I LOVE Home Goods . This place is the dream for kitting out babys room for a bargain . With goods much like Marshalls and TJ Maxx but with a focus on the decor side of things , obviously . Some of my finds include ; <p> More hangers ! <p> Storage boxes/Laundry Hamper ( $4-25 -versus- $15-50+ ) <p> Diaper caddies ( $6-12 -versus- $20+ ) <p> Clip on musical crib nightlight/soother ( $6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <h> Amazon <p> Amazon may not be a discount store per se but as I am a Prime member it has been worth every cent . As a Prime member I qualify for free two-day shipping , unlimited free TV/movie streaming , unlimited photo storage , access to Prime Pantry ( groceries on your door step ? Yes please ! ) and more . <p> As a Prime member you are also eligible to become a member of Amazon Family . You can make an Amazon Baby Registry and qualify for a FREE welcome box choc full of baby items and free samples/coupons . As well as this you will receive 15% off an item of your choice on your registry and a number of other offers including a free Kindle e-book and discounted clothing . <p> For me , the best part about Amazon Prime are the subscription options . When you subscribe to diapers ( you choose the frequency of their delivery ) you get 20% off and a $2 off coupon on your first delivery . If you subscribe to a total of 5 items at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The bargain price of sub $25 for 200+ diapers and peace of mind that they will arrive on my doorstep in 48 hours is especially worth it to me . I subscribe to dog food , baby wipes and other personal items which means I never have to remember them on my weekly grocery shop . <p> I am so happy with my baby bargain stockpile as I get such a kick out of having exactly what I wanted and still having a little extra cash in my purse ! Off the top of my head , there is over $500 of savings just from the items I have listed ( I have n't listed every single item I have purchased on this journey ! ) including the retail value of the baby clothing from Goodwill . <p> The pregnancy journey is thrilling , especially for first time mothers . You want to scream it from the roof tops while simultaneously wanting to not tell anyone out of- sheer worry . In our social media age a tendency to share every facet of lives exists for many . Whether its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a witty one liner on twitter its so easy to share your excitement without fully acknowledging exactly who can see it . I admit it myself that sometimes I snap a photograph with social media in mind and not solely to capture a memory . <p> Let 's be honest , many of use have friends on social media we would n't exactly consider to be close . Platforms like twitter and Instagram can invite literally anyone to view your content . This is why for the most part I have n't documented too many milestones of my pregnancy on the blog . I find it rather eerie to think about who might be reading about such a personal experience of mine . <p> That said , I read blogs daily where people go into graphic detail about the inner workings of their womb . Some announce their pregnancy on the day they discover it . Others declare the gender of their baby to the public . I have even seen some publish teaser posts inviting readers to guess babys name ! This is definitely a different pregnancy world to the one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I knew . I personally am more private about my pregnancy . It is overwhelmingly exciting but I would rather contain that excitement within the bounds of my family and friends . <p> My crux with baring all throughout pregnancy however is not what I read online . I take no issue with what women choose to post and fully admit to thoroughly enjoying many of these posts ! My problem lies with the people I meet in the street <p> Whether it is due to being surrounded by such open accounts of pregnancy or just a- general sense of entitlement I have been taken aback by some of the questions I am asked on a regular basis . As soon as the bump popped and my pregnancy became apparent , I noticed that some people took it as a green light to ask pretty personal questions . Or at least questions I feel are inappropriate and would n't dream of asking others . <h> My Top Three Irritating Pregnancy Questions ! <p> What are you having ? <p> This one is the only one that makes me genuinely mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby " . I do not believe that because some people happily announce their babys gender that it is free game in every other pregnancy . What makes people think they have a right to such a deeply intimate fact ? <p> Another question comes with this one and it is , " Do you know but are n't  saying ? " or " Do you reeeeeeally not know ? " . <p> STOP IT . If you have been given a firm , " we have n't found out " then please accept it and move on . <p> What names are you thinking of ? <p> Note , this is n't the question " have you considered any names ? " . This question seeks to know what those names are . BEFORE YOUR BABY ARRIVES . The baby is going to come out of me faster and more easily than that information . Keep walking . <p> When are you due ? because you 're tiny *stares at bump* <p> Admittedly , this is not an offensive question at all . However it is when paired with a disapproving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please stop skinny shaming me . I am 6ft tall and there 's plenty of torso for baby to hide in . FYI my baby is slightly above normal fetal growth rate ! Relax . <p> I have n't documented much of my pregnancy on the blog because I wanted to keep it private but now a part of me wishes I had ! Time has flown by and it has truly surprised me how fleeting these moments really are. - Its hard to believe I am in the final weeks of this pregnancy single digits now ! <p> I swore at the beginning I would take a weekly bump photo and it saddens me that I did n't  . I was either too busy , feeling too gross or just forgot until I was already into another week . During the first 16 weeks , there was no bump to photograph anyway ! Personally , I like to read about what different women experience at different stages . No two pregnancies are the same but it can be comforting to know what you could expect or even just know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have officially entered the third trimester , I have decided to post a little update . <h> How far along ? <p> 30 weeks <h> Babys Size <p> A cantaloupe according to my app ! Baby weighs over 3.5 lbs <h> Total weight gain <p> 18 lbs <h> Maternity clothes <p> Over-the-bump jeans ( H&amp;M Mama maternity skinny jeans are LIFE ! They are super affordable too and often on sale. ) since week 16 and some maternity tops since week 25 although most werent necessary they were just cute . I still have many wearable non-maternity tops . All my leggings are my pre-pregnancy ones . <h> Stretch marks <p> None , yet but the itchiest skin &gt;. &lt; <h> Sleep <p> Theres three scenarios here : <p> If I can get to sleep at a decent hour , I am out until baby uses my bladder as a punching bag . Which is usually about 1000 times a night . In this case I usually get back to sleep . <p> I get to sleep after midnight but then sleep through until the early morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . I have an insatiable desire to organize ALL THE THINGS ! <p> A somewhat comfortable sleep position . <p> To finally meet baby . <h> Movement <p> Lots and lots . Its always a party in there . Mostly early in the morning , late afternoon and around 10pm . Now that baby is getting a bit cramped in there , the movements are lessviolent ! <h> Cravings <p> Nothing odd and nothing in particular ! If I had to say anything I would say cinnamon rolls . But you do n't  need to be pregnant to want those all the time . <h> Nausea <p> Some occasional morning weakness before breakfast . Since I was so sick in the first trimester I figure it will strike again somewhere in the third . <h> Gender <p> Waiting for baby to reveal all ! <h> Symptoms <p> Indigestion after most foods but not so much heartburn , difficulty sleeping , back ache , fatigue , general lack of motivation to do anything and although my bump is small the beginning of a very attractive waddle . <h> Belly button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor out at the moment and it freaks me out so much . <h> Wedding rings on or off ? <p> Still on although at the end of most days they do n't  want to come off . <h> Happy or moody most of the time <p> Both . Predominantly moody though . Mostly feeling a mix of excitement and overwhelm in these weeks where baby has become more real . <h> Looking forward to <p> Completing the nursery , finalizing name options , trying to relax knowing everything is ready ( HA ! When will that be ? ! ) and giving you another update ! <p> There 's always one . In every situation , pregnant or not there is always one negative person who has nothing positive to say on the matter . In pregnancy , the same applies . Whether its strangers patting your belly or unsolicited advice , there 's plenty of negativity to fill your nine months and beyond . <p> I was home in Ireland briefly and sadly , I kind of regret going . Not because I received negativity but because I received support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was finally able to share the pregnancy journey with those who seemed concerned , interested and happy for me . I can not describe the feeling of going through such a special time and being the only one invested in it . So I wont even try but it was very hard to leave a loving , familiar environment and return to one void of such happiness . <p> I have come to discover here that when I am in the company of others , all I hear regarding my pregnancy is what will or will potentially go wrong . I spoke in my last post about struggling with my mental health throughout this pregnancy . The last thing any expectant first-time mother wishes to hear is what they are doing wrong or what will go wrong . It baffles me that at such a special time in life , the only sentiments offered are negative . With all due respect if you have nothing nice to say , then say nothing . <p> I understand that some people do n't  worry . I am a sensitive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  get me wrong , I am confident in this pregnancy . If it werent for the external factors I would say I am loving it . But I have the normal apprehension that is to be expected when facing delivering your first baby . Fortunately , in my battalion I also have my intelligence , a strong maternal instinct and a drive to succeed . Maybe I internalize too much but I can not bear someone treating me like I know absolutely nothing . Condescending comments that almost infer I have n't held , cared for or ever even seen an infant in my life . Negativity about the way I eat , drink or choose to care for myself during the gestation . Telling me with a loud cackle how my house will never be the palace it is now , again . UGH . <h> Like snowflakes , fingerprints and pregnancies we are all unique . <p> Why is it so hard to live and let live ? In my rant I have digressed . I have taken too long to realize that the health and well-being of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Giving these people power over your emotions is the worst way to manage . You must continue on boldly and bravely in your pregnancy . You are the mother . That intuition is strong for a reason . You know what is best for you and for baby . Embrace the positivity you receive . Be thankful for those people and their kind words , generosity and support . Give them the space in your head and heart . <h> Dealing With Negative Nancy During Your Pregnancy <p> Bite your tongue <p> Smile and nod <p> Say thank you <p> Firmly but nicely state that you do not wish to discuss certain topics if they are too personal or invasive <p> Do n't  focus on the fact that your boundaries are being disrespected and allow it to become bitterness . Some people just truly believe they know everything <p> Try to remember that to them the advice is coming from a good place and not one of malice <p> Do n't  internalize it as condescension , often empty vessels simply make the most noise <p> The topic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to it than a bandwagon . Finally , an idea with more substance than adulting or the apparently vital role Target plays in our lives . The new year brings high hopes , willingness to embrace change and goals , goals , goals ! This year , after an extremely emotionally demanding 2016 , my main goal is self improvement . This resolution was borne out of necessity . With my first baby arriving soon there is simply no choice to continue in the mental state I was in . Stress is not good for your growing baby so it is incredibly important to ensure you have a safe , stress-free and happy pregnancy . Taking time for yourself is easier said than done but if I could prevent even one person from feeling the strain I have felt then I would be content . <p> Whether your stress is a direct result of work , relationship issues , financial problems etc. it does not matter . The physical affects of stress on your developing baby can be detrimental to their mental health in years to come . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for inflicting my sadness and worries onto my baby . Clawing your way out of a rut is n't easy and casting aside fears is less so . With every kick and hiccup from inside I am reminded and determined to be the best version of myself . Both for the baby and for my own happiness . Sometimes you will come to realize that your expectations of support are nothing more than expectation and in that situation you must be everything you need by yourself . <h> " So what can I do to minimize stress ? " <p> First of all , like any issue , recognize that you need help and be able to admit it . Even if only to yourself . Fortunately with self care , YOU can help you . All it takes is remembering be to intentional . <p> Self care practices range from the tiniest trivial activity to life altering decisions and you get to choose what is best for you . Nobody knows you better than yourself ! Simply put , do more of the things you love , the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means taking a vacation or just putting on freshly laundered pjs then do it and do it solely for you . <p> As a highly sensitive and introverted person , time outs are a necessity for me . Unfortunately time away from the chaos does n't  simply equate to positive , revitalizing me-time . I can often spend it in turmoil with a very messy , over analytical mindset . This serves me no purpose and adds to my woes . For self care to be legitimate and genuinely help you , you must be intentionally selfish and make it entirely about you . <p> These activities are so easy but we often ignore them . Sometimes we just need a little nudge ! What are some of your favorite self care practices ? <p> Initially , the thoughts of a maternity wardrobe horrified me which is strange because I love fashion , shopping and everything related . It was n't the fact that I would need bigger clothes . Or the effort of shopping for them but simply the fact that if you stick the word maternity in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sting in that is the amount of time you will actually spend wearing these pieces . It is so short ! So in my pregnancy ignorance I assumed I would get away with leggings and my loose tunic style tops for the next few months . Yeah , I quickly learned that is n't going to happen . My bump is still teeny tiny but I am rocking the maternity jeans a good few weeks now . Undershirts have become weird belly tops and button down tops no longer button . <p> With that , I have started to pick up a few key pieces that are versatile enough to build different outfits around . Think essential basics like leggings , tanks , long tees , tunics , casual jersey dresses and layering items like shirts , cardigans and blanket scarves . <p> Luckily I will be spending my pregnancy sporting Winter gear . I can not imagine being pregnant in the height of a Georgia Summer , ick . However , Winter really only arrives here in January so there is no need for heavy coats and huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will need some cold weather attire occasionally but I hope to pull this off by layering basics with chunky cardigans already in my wardrobe ! <p> Comfort is the winner for me with style taking a close second . Here are some of my suggested essentials to get you through your Fall/Winter pregnancy in total comfort and the height of style = <h> BASIC TOPS <p> I would suggest buying these in white , grey and black or multiples of whichever your favorite color is ! These are perfect for layering . Wear under sweaters , kimonos , cardigans , blazer etc . I love the longer length to cover the waistband of my jeans/leggings . If you are still doing the hair-tie trick with your pants , they are perfect for hiding that too ! <h> SWEATERS &amp; LAYERING <p> None of these are maternity pieces which I love because you 'll wear them long after baby arrives . Kimonos are light and airy and look great over leggings for a relaxed but dressed up look . I LOVE this plaid kimono , get your Autumn plaid shirt fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to layers so it needs no explanation . How cute is this layered sweater ? Its also peplum which means you can wear it without the bump stretching it out ! Win ! <h> BOTTOMS <p> Maternity jeans and a pair of comfy leggings ( or 5 ! ) will be absolutely lived in throughout your entire pregnancy . I was lucky enough to get a 40% off any single item code for H&amp;M which allowed me to pick up these jeans for a steal . Overalls/dungarees are a love or hate maternity piece but I adore this skinny legged pair ! <h> DRESSES <p> If dresses are your style then they will be your splurge item . However if you find a casual dress that can take you from day to night then it will be an worthwhile investment ! Add a wide brim hat and chunky statement jewelry to dress these basic dresses up ! I personally would pair dress #4 with denim leggings and over the knee boots as I do n't  like bare legs with knit dresses but to each their own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear similar styles <p> If you follow the blogs social media accounts and saw my previous post , Little Pumpkin then you will already know that we are expecting ! Baby Scott arrives next Spring and we are so flippin excited ! Ive been very sick in my first trimester and I strive to do all that I can to help other women deal with morning sickness misery ! " Not another post about morning sickness ! " , I hear you cry . There are endless morning sickness remedies out there . How do I know how many there are ? Because I searched for them ALL . I read them all and I tried them all . Some worked wonders , other made me worse so I 've compiled a list of what kept me at my best during my worst ! Hopefully they can help you too . <p> Intuitively , I knew I would experience morning sickness . Its me . Everything turns my stomach , even at full health . I have a high pain tolerance but the weakest stomach and I was anxious in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was 7 weeks 3 days at my initial prenatal exam and first ultrasound . The nurse asked me how I was feeling and I was on top of the world . She mused that I might be one of the lucky ones and I went home wondering if I was . <p> The very next day I woke up to the room spinning , stomach growling and vomit rising in my throat . T.M.I ? Get used to it . Pregnancy and dignity do n't  go hand in hand I 've found . <p> I was floored and it was a vicious cycle . I was feeling deathly sick but starving at the same time . Let 's face it the last thing you want when you are sitting on bathroom floor waiting to vomit is a big meal . I learned my lesson quickly though . The reason I was feeling so sick was because I needed food . I needed to eat something the second I woke up and last thing at night . As well as this , I needed to eat frequently to avoid any sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Top 6 Morning Sickness Musts <p> Eat immediately upon waking and right before bedtime . In the morning I found a dry , crunchy granola bar would give me enough energy and tide me over while I was getting myself up and dressed . I would go downstairs and have breakfast right afterwards . At night time I would eat the same but maybe add a banana . This was enough to fill me in case I woke in the middle of the night . <p> Eat every 2 to 3 hours . This sounds excessive but for me it was the only way I got through my morning-noon-night sickness . I would eat at 9am , 12pm , 2/3pm , 5pm , 7pm and 9/10pm . Some of these were meals ( whatever I could keep down ) and the rest were light , dry and downright boring snacks . Meals consisted of A LOT of carbohydrates and other plain but filling foods . Bread , rice , pasta , cereals etc . Snacks were crackers , granola bars , oatmeal and fruits that I could stomach like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on water . I know , I know , its impossible to drink liters of water while feeling so awful . I added a teaspoon of the juice of a fresh lemon to every bottle of water I drank to add some flavor . The tartness made it easier to swallow . The days where I slacked on my water intake were hell . My head spun and the nausea was undoubtedly stronger . Not to mention the most important factor all those fluids are necessary for babies development ! <p> Brew your own ginger tea . I both won and lost here . Who knew you could overdose on ginger ? Not this girl . Its rough . Trust me . I was so sick one day that I boiled the kettle , grated some fresh ginger and made my own tea . Grate your ginger into a bowl and pour hot water on top . Let it steep for a few minutes . Strain this water into a cup over a teaspoon of honey and a teaspoon of lemon then add more warm water . The key here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half teaspoon of grated ginger is enough . I used too much ! The tea settled my stomach and I felt really good but the next two days were not pleasant . I had sent my body into a full digestive detox/cleanse and I do n't  need to describe that to anyone . <p> Put your go-to snacks EVERYWHERE . In the glove box of the car , in every handbag you own , in every pocket of your clothing , on your nightstand , on your coffee table , etc . Sometimes just walking to the pantry to get my food made the world spin . I liked to have things on hand at all times . <p> Something I struggled with during the worst weeks of sickness was the gross metallic taste in my excessively dry mouth . I tried sucking on glassy , fruity candy but was overwhelmed by sweetness . I recommend ginger candies just for the purpose of settling the stomach but the taste can become overpowering . What worked best for me in the end was peppermints and occasionally chewing gum . Chewing gum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind off the i 'll feeling . <p> As I said my sickness began at week 7 . It peaked at week 10 and by the very end of week 11 it became far more manageable . By the time week 12 rolled around I was waking up with more energy and barely any inkling of illness , which is typical of nearing the second trimester . The only time I feel sick now is if I allow myself to go far too long without eating . I really hope some of these tips work for someone else out there because it can feel downright hopeless and miserable . <p> Autumn is finally , officially here and while everyones talking about all pumpkin everything , I 've been keeping a tiny pumpkin of my own a big secret ! <h> WERE HAVING A BABY ! <p> Did I get to the point quick enough ? I feel like I could burst with relief from keeping it quiet for so long ! I agonized for weeks- about whether or not I would announce this on the blog but I figured I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little strange to suddenly become a mom blogger without ever mentioning becoming a mother <p> Baby Scott will be making an appearance next Spring . Babys photos probably wont feature on the blog but our adventures undoubtedly will . He or she will be our greatest one of all ! <p> Everything coming our way is very exciting . I have loved everyones blog posts that have helped me through this pregnancy so far and given me great advice for the future .

@@48796313 @2296313/ <p> Happy Birthday , Sass &amp; Shamrocks ! The blog is one year old today ! - A whole year of consistent blogging , I cant believe I did it ! I wish I could say its been a consistently wonderful experience . Its been rather stressful at times but it has been a profound and steep learning curve where I 've learned lessons not only about blogging but about other people and myself . <p> The blogging world is simultaneously simple and extremely complex . I jumped in head first and definitely felt like I was drowning very quickly . I do n't  think its ever possible to learn it all when it comes to the internet , blogging and social media . The whole environment transforms so rapidly that every day there is something new to learn . <p> While I learned many complex lessons ( the hard way ) , here are some of the more basic things I have come to realize which may help those those new to blogging or those considering set up a website for the first time . <h> 12 Lessons In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I pondered for a while before purchasing my domain . I researched online- and read horror stories of transferring domain names to different hosting platforms which involved losing all content and subscribers . From the start I chose to go with Bluehost . Of course you do n't  have to purchase a domain name at all . You can use any amount of free platforms to host your blog . However , if you plan to monetize your blog through ads or affiliates then many of the free options will not allow you to do that . Make sure you know what 's what . <p> You are your brand . The way you communicate and let your personality shine through to your website will end up being your brand . Think about this especially if you are using your blog to promote your business . You may be extremely witty , opinionated or curse like a sailor but will this hurt your brand ? That being said you must stay true to who you are and be honest in order to gain your readers trust and build a genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Screw niche blogging . While some bloggers have a blatant niche by default ( travel , food , fashion , technology etc . ) I do n't  believe that every blog requires such strict boundaries . Most bloggers label their site lifestyle , inc. me for descriptive reasons . I do n't  necessarily stick to this . Your blog will evolve just as much as you will as a person . I started mine to write about the trials and tribulations of adapting to a new life in the US , the challenges of being a military spouse and talking about my home in Ireland . Since then I have given into my creative side and posted many recipes , DIYs and started to pursue a potential photography career . Towards the end of the year my blog took a rapid swing toward pregnancy and parenting with the impending arrival of my first baby . Next year I hope to add photography to my categories and maybe even offer services in that field which will see the blog take more of a business oriented turn . In particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound by rules . Its your blog . There are none ! <p> Connect with like-minded people . For business , this is really important . You must have a target audience and know where to seek them out and connect . Do n't  waste too much of your time promoting to the wrong people . For-fun blogging is different , while you may have the most in common with bloggers in your niche ( I am trying to use the term loosely ) there 's no harm in connecting with others too . <p> Do n't  be a selfish group member . Blog groups are a great way to connect with other bloggers , seek advice and promote your blog . Many of these groups offer promotion threads where you can leave a link to be viewed/commented on/shared etc . In return , you must do the same for X amount of other links . These groups have been invaluable to me for getting my blog out there and for making new friends . However , there are a vast number of people who drop their links , do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even refer to the threads as chore threads ( HA ! ) . Unfortunately you cant do anything about others lack of integrity . You will come to recognize the bad apples pattern and not waste your time , instead giving your time and connection to worthy , honest group members . <p> You can get what you want , if you 're willing to work for it . If your blog is for fun , you can have immense fun blogging . If your blog is to impact change , you can impact change . If your blog is monetized through ads and sponsored posts then you can work with brands . If your blog is for your business , you can promote your business . Obvious , right ? Well it all ties in with my last point . If you are hard working , honest and build the right network all of these individual goals are achievable. - I personally know people who have reeled in a steady income from two months of blogging , people who have used their blogs to get into a position to fulfill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , selling a physical product they have created or simply sending out a message for nothing in return ) . I blog predominantly for fun although I have made money through ads , working with brands and posted affiliate links on occasion . In general I do not seek sponsorship but will collaborate if I like the brand . I have turned down many sponsored opportunities because I did n't  like the product/brand . I wo n't post about things I do not like , use or have any interest in because they offer me cash . <p> Get creative . I have always been creative but in recent years I spent so much time up to my eyes in technological academia that I did n't  allow myself a creative outlet . Since launching my blog I have embraced arts , crafts , cooking etc. more than I ever have . Other bloggers have been more inspirational to me than I realized . My creative side seeping out through little projects for my blog has in turn reignited my love for photography ( that I knew nothing about ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and am in the process of signing up for more advanced modules to see where the future takes me with that . I aim to be less lazy with my images and ditch the iPhonography Ive been habitually posting as my blog graphics and use my brand new Canon more and more . Its amazing what avenues a blog is capable of taking you down , embrace them . You may very well find yourself doing something unexpected and realizing its your calling ! <p> Know your copyright rights . I have had many cases of suspiciously similar posts popping up days after posting mine but twice this year I had incidents of word-for-word plagiarism . It is so disheartening as well as infuriating that people just steal your work from under you . Sometimes its also comical the way they utterly deny it despite time stamps and welllogic . Have a copyright statement on your content . It helps to know the legal protocol and who to contact if you are being ripped off . <p> Get to know social media trends . This was my biggest mountain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unfortunately you can not get away from it when blogging . I have come to love Pinterest the most . Not only is it my biggest traffic driver and largest social following but it feeds my creative side and aids my photography/blog skills . Facebook is my enemy . Reach is poor no matter how strategically you play the game and Ive known some bloggers to lose their pages without any explanation . I use it a couple of times a week but it is n't my be all and end all . I love Instagram , obviously , because photography is a big hobby of mine but when it comes to the blog I am wary of it . The vast majority of IG followers only follow to gain a follower themselves . Shortly after , they may unfollow ! I personally follow accounts of profiles I genuinely like or resonate with . Otherwise , I do not see a point . There are strategic times to post on various SM platforms , your insights will show you what your followers like and when they like to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them when they want it . <p> Time does n't  have to be your enemy . Do n't  be afraid to take a break ! I was totally overwhelmed with blogging at the beginning . What I did know is that I wanted to post consistently so I posted three times per week but I was n't happy . I had zero time and my content was crappy . I cut one post and started putting out two and have since whittled it down to just once per week . On occasion I will post twice . Read here to see how posting less actually benefited my blog and increased my traffic ! If you are in the blogging biz and have to be connected at all times then you should consider paid scheduling services or even hiring a virtual assistant . <p> Embrace change . Your blog changes on your terms but sometimes external factors change it for you . Example , my pregnancy gave a new avenue to travel down . If you are unwilling to budge or be diverse with content , your readers will get bored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new . If it does n't  work , try something else ! <p> So here 's to another year , a new baby and seeing where this blogging journey continues to take me ! <p> More posts , more traffic , more subscribers , right ? In my case , wrong . I started blogging over 8 months ago and consistency was my initial goal . While consistency is important it does n't  necessarily mean lots of posts - a big mistake I was making . I would post on Monday , Wednesday and Friday consistently for months . I was drained . Although my stats and follow count were growing , my plate was full and my brain was empty . I was drained . I had more writers block than interest in my blog . What good were all my readers when I was churning out sub-par content ? They would get bored and leave anyway . <p> As well as poor content , by posting three times a week my posts had a shelf life of just one day . One day to promote my blog meant joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine to join them all , it is easy to forget that you must also complete them . Fulfilling group requirements , managing your own social media platforms , building community AND preparing new content every day was exhausting . This is all in addition to my normal day to day life . Talk about burn out . <p> It became somewhat manageable . And by manageable I mean I was stressed , irritable and ignoring my own needs physically and mentally . When it really became too much is when we had travel plans or social engagements and I would be forced to take a break . Note I said forced because that 's how the self-inflicted pressure made me feel . I would return home to masses of threads to complete , comments to answer and social media to engage with . I needed to manage the blog entirely differently . It was literally taking the reigns of my entire life . <h> I decided to give myself the gift of time <p> I dropped Fridays post . Every week I started to schedule just two posts . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and save the weightier post for Wednesday . This meant that I had Thursday through Sunday to get maximum exposure . I started to see my traffic rise and my posts shared to social media twice as much as before . <p> Then I hit the dreaded writers block . After weeks of scheduling , the well had run dry and with family events and vacations planned I was under pressure again . Knowing I would be away from my laptop for a couple of weeks terrified me . I would have minimal time to post and I would have virtually no time to promote . So I bit the bullet and posted just on Monday for a few weeks . The result ? Shocking . I had three times the views on my posts at the end of every week . They were shared twice as much and a few of them went semi-viral on Pinterest giving me thousands of repins and thus , thousands of unique visitors and views . <p> Publishing a post every Monday has changed my blog and my life . I have time again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to properly engage with my readers , time to be more creative , time for myself and all with the added bonus of a growing blog ! <p> Its really scary to try to do less in order to gain more but for your own sanity and ability to have an authentic voice I highly recommend it . That being said if blogging seven days a week is what YOU want to do then by all means do it ! You have to find your balance . Ironically I have been posting twice a week again lately , not every single week but more often than I had been . With being pregnant and the holiday season now in full swing , I simply have a lot more to say . Lucky you , or poor you depending on how you see it = <p> PIN FOR THE WIN ! If you 're blogging without utilizing a Pinterest account then you are missing out ! I get it , youve just started blogging and now you 're buried beneath countless social media platforms . My advice would be to optimize one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ignore the rest . If you are trying to juggle a thousand accounts to promote your blog but do n't  have time to write the blog then the practice is redundant . I focus mainly on Pinterest and Facebook and occasionally I dip my toes in Instagram and Twitter . Facebook is like a moody teenager . Some days she is obliging and sweet as pie , other days she hates your guts and refuses to help you . I will conquer Facebooks wildly complicated algorithms one day but for now , I 'm going to tell you about Pinterest . <p> When I first started blogging I developed an irrational fear of being away from my laptop . I became a stat stalker . I would see my hard work flatline if I took a day off and it affected me . If I kept this up it would have meant that I had no life outside this blog . Luckily I learned that lesson early on and made myself a blogging schedule . Sometimes this thing called life happens and that schedule changes but I try to adapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting bored of hearing bloggers sing the praises of Pinterest . I thought it was worthless and it was doing nothing for me . That was wrong of me . Pinterest is now my biggest traffic driver . For Sass &amp; Shamrocks , it was Succulents For Beginners that took off first . The pin now has over 4000 repins ! Of all social media platforms , Pinterest extends the shelf life of your content beyond measure . I now have two pins that sit there and pull in thousands of viewers a week and I do n't  have to do a thing ! <p> Pinterest has changed its algorithms and it has a drastic affect on your reach . Prior to the recent changes , you could join group boards ( more on those later ) and reach masses with your one little pin . Now , more than ever , Pinterest will reward the growth and popularity of your own personal boards . This of course means success takes longer but what 's the harm in a bit of hard work ? <p> I started my blog in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of April . here 's just a small sample of the growth I achieved by using a social media platform I used all along for fun anyway ! <h> 12 Steps To Optimize Your Pinterest Account <h> Get A Business Account <p> Firstly , how do I have Pinterest analytics as seen above ? I switched my personal account to a business account . Its free and can be done without losing the pins/followers on your original account . After a couple of days you will be able to see the behavior of your followers and pins . This is a very handy tool for determining what your followers like to pin . <h> Enable Rich Pins <p> What 's a rich pin ? Necessary ! Rich pins look more professional , stand out and they are also a nifty tool to prevent anyone claiming your content as their own . They contain more embedded information such as where the pin has been shared from , direct links and for small businesses , pricing . Get them now ! <h> Give Your Account Your Blog Name <p> Remove the bells and whistles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters and wide spacing between letters . Give your account your blog name plain and simple . If you want to include your own name then put it after the blog title or in parentheses . <h> Simple Descriptive Board Labels <p> The name game applies to your boards too . Give your boards clean , simple and applicable labels . No characters , no spacing . I have entitled mine in upper case letters . <h> Niche Boards <p> Pin to boards that fit your niche . If you have other boards you can not part with then make them secret and continue pinning to them . I totally have a board dedicated to giant , fluffy Old English Sheepdogs but you cant see it ! . Analyze the demographics of your followers . Maybe you do n't  have kids but have a lot of mom blog followers who enjoy your DIY and Food boards create a board they may like related to kids/parenting/family vacation ideas etc . Of course pin to the board the things YOU like . It is your account after all . <h> Join Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else that you can pin to . Some of these boards have thousands of followers and can be a good place to get your content seen . You will need to be invited to the board before you can pin . Often , the owner of the board will leave an email address in the board description so you can send a request to join . If you are struggling to find boards in your niche , search for some on PinGroupie . <h> Spring Clean Old Content <p> This was the kick starter for me . Stale pins are hurting your reach and engagement Regularly ( once a month/two months ) go through your pins and remove the ones with less than four repins . Pinterest rewards popularity . You need to repin and like pins that have a good repin record . This means your followers will engage with them also . <h> Choose Your Timing <p> Pinterest is typically the most active between 8pm and 1am and saturday mornings are also popular . Pin during these times as there will be more pinners available to save your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started in April with 45 followers and at present I have over 700 . I gained organic followers by following in my niche , **25;93;TOOLONG their content and pinning more of what my followers want ( thanks , analytics ! ) . It started slow but now I gain between 10 and 20 followers daily and even more if I get involved in Pinterest threads . <h> Pin Often <p> I also gain followers so consistently because I pin often . I do n't  mean time-sucking dedication to the site or the type of obsession that means you abandon your family and friends for that little red button . No , I mean picking up your phone and pinning 2/3 things when standing in line at the bank or waiting on a friend for coffee . If you absent minded-ly pin throughout the day it does n't  even feel like a task . This is something I would do anyway before I even started the blog . <h> Create Pin Friendly Images <p> Pinterest likes vertical images with some white space and lots of color . Ensure you are creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye-catching and get buried . Be as creative as you wish but make sure your brand is n't overly fussy or glaringly busy . This will turn people off . Pinterest is a visual place and images catch the eye more than content , initially . <h> Add Descriptions <p> Make sure your pin descriptions contain key words related to the content . Some people say with the new algorithm changes you do n't  need to include hashtags but I still use one or two that I think fits best along with a short description . <p> I now have a number of pins that keep my blog alive when I am busy living my real life and you can too . Let me know in the comments how you find Pinterest . <p> When I first started blogging I did n't  even consider my niche . I just wrote about what I was doing , my current situation , things that were of interest to me at that time , etc . I quickly discovered that to promote and connect with fellow bloggers my blog needed to have some type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled with this definition for the first month . I was Irish , newly married and recently emigrated to the US . I liked fashion , food and travel but did n't  want my blog to be categorized so narrowly under any of these things . Getting my head around that mish-mash of interests and circumstances was hard for me and I found it difficult to , as the saying now goes , find my tribe . I came to accept that my blog is a lifestyle blog that focuses on a healthy mix of all of the above . But what 's more important is that I stopped worrying about fitting in and just continued writing . You will read a billion articles online , all telling you the importance of sticking to your niche and while that is necessary in business , if you are blogging for fun then my response to that is , " who said so ? ! " <p> After publishing posts consistently and learning what my viewers liked the most I started to settle into my own blog and became more confident when hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was good but happy with what I was saying and HOW I was saying it . Although you strive to give your readers what they want , it is of the utmost importance to write what YOU want , too . Your viewers have come to your site because they like you and your content , they will return if they love it . If they leave , so be it . More will come . <p> As I said in my last post , I have seen people switch niches a lot . There 's many reasons for going beyond the limits of your niche . Perhaps you are after getting bogged down in an area you no longer have anything to write about due to changes in life circumstances . For example , you had a travel blog but are now settling down into motherhood and want to focus on writing articles on parenting . Or you have been blogging about college life but are now entering the working world . There 's an array of reasons to re-brand your blog but there is NEVER a reason to not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back from my tangential rambling to the idea of writing in your voice . Of course I do n't  mean voice in the traditional sense- but the portrayal of your personality through the words you write . You are unique and your writing style should be too . If you are a really funny and bubbly person but write in a monotonous tone with none of the humor you possess naturally then your content will not be authentic . And although we live in a world where we can fake happiness , good fortune and popularity quite easily via social media , your blog will expose a greater portion of yourself to the world . Make that section of your life that is on show , honest . Writing is powerful and people are perceptive beings . Posts repeatedly written in any voice but your own will be transparent and shallow . Your readers will not trust you or your content and wont engage . <p> The first thing I notice when reading blog posts , or any piece of writing for that matter , is the writing style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serial user of cliches and slang which is considered vulgarity and terrible writing by some ( or most ) . In the world of professional writing I would more than likely be be condemned ! I do strive to improve my writing skills and blogging refreshes a great deal of lessons already learned about writing but when it comes to writing posts I often skip the- rules and mechanics of composing the perfect piece of literature as I try to write them as an exact reflection of myself and what I might say in a discussion with a real life person ! The wit , sarcasm , humor whatever you want to label it is exactly how I converse with people . That is who I am . I 'm sure there are people who like my posts , those who can take or leave them and others whod rather poke out their eyes than read to the bottom . I 'm totally ok with that ! Well I 'd prefer if you held onto your eyes but I 'm fine with you leaving . Not everyone shares the same interests and opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The feelings I express , are genuine . My sentiments when I comment on your posts , are genuine . Being a genuine person is what I respect the most in any human being . I have no time for any single trait that is a fraction less than honest . <p> When I borderline stalk every social media platform you use , I love your blog ! When I like your pictures , I genuinely like your pictures . When I share your content , I really do think you have a message worth sending out . I like all of these things about you because you have probably won me over by writing in your own voice . <p> For those of you starting out , who maybe havent found your blogging voice yet , ask yourself before publishing is this for the glory of a spike in views , free products , money , etc. ? If the answer is yes to any of the above , then I suggest you save your draft and go back to the drawing board . <p> For those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling like you need to start writing as someone else to fit in stop it ! Explore the boundaries of your niche , find new forums to join , freshen up your content but for the love of God , keep writing in your own voice ! <h> If you struggle with finding your voice , what is it about blogging that limits your authenticity ? <p> Get comfortable , you 're in this one for the long haul ! Nothing could have prepared me for the world of blogging . I was under no illusion that it would be easy to consistently post to the website but starting out that was about the extent of my concern . How quickly I learned that this was not to be . Sass &amp; Shamrocks is 3 months old today ! To be 100% honest ( because I do n't  see the point in being any other way ) , thus far the negative aspects of running this blog outweigh the positives but I 'm optimistic in thinking that wont always be the case . <p> Blogging is EXHAUSTING , it infiltrates your entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gobbles up vast quantities of your time and energy . In the beginning when I was desperately trying to teach myself how to do everything at once , I skipped meals and hardly slept thankfully it is n't like that anymore . This is the number one stinger for me ; I am a perfectionist . A perfectionist who is excellent at organization but terrible at time management . Instead of separating tasks and adhering to a strict schedule I like to think that I can juggle 50 things simultaneously . I always know exactly what needs to be done but do not have the patience to do them separately . I am slowly learning to complete tasks , one action at a time rather than half a**ing everything I attempt to do at once . Blogging has taught me that it takes far less time to compartmentalize than it takes to sort through a huge mass of chaos . Good old fashioned pen and paper lists have become my saviors . <p> One of the first things you will learn about writing a blog and building a following is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to post every single day to keep your viewers interested but you should post on a fairly consistent schedule . Whether it is once , twice or three times a week your subscribers will come to know your posting schedule and expect new content on those days . The key is to post according to your own capabilities , i.e. how much time you have to commit to writing , posting and promoting your work . The other and most important point here is quality . You can post every single day of the year if you wish but realistically how good or unique will those posts be ? Strive to publish your best pieces and if this means only once a week then so be it . I am not claiming any expertise here and my blog is still in its infancy but I have made these mistakes and posted thrice a week only to churn out utter rubbish . I have since removed content that A ) I did not put my best efforts into B ) Does not fit into my niche C ) Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my next point , write about what you want , using your voice/personality and what is inherently YOU . I post about my personal journey , things that interest me and that are relevant to my life . Through that I connect with like-minded people experiencing the same and building that network is a dream . I have seen blogs start around the same time as mine and have been following their blogging adventure as much as my own . I have seen some shoot to success from day one , I have seen others grow at a snails pace and adapt to their niche as they find their feet in the blogging world just like me . I have even seen some disappear into the internet abyss never to be heard of again but I have also seen others sell out quickly to affiliate programs and brands that seemed to be nothing to do with their overall blog mission . Monetizing your blog is possible through EXTREME hard graft . Some are lucky and soar almost directly into a financially cushy blog spot , others kill themselves for cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site but the monetization of Sass &amp; Shamrocks was not my reason to launch . I truly write for release , fun and the connections/friendships made along the way . <p> Let me tell- you about some people you will endure experience on your blogging journey . People can be flippin terrible . It is wrong of me to tar a portion of the population with one brush so I 'll illustrate this via anecdotes about actual negative interaction on Sass &amp; Shamrocks . Does anyone have frenemies ? Yknow the ones you thought you left back in high school the types who smile at you in the street but for some reason have an inward distaste for your existence , well if you promote your posts through your facebook page you will see that there are a few lurkers . Facebook insights are revealing . Very revealing . For example , the single person who consistently hides my posts regardless of what they are . The person who hides every post relating to my trip home to Ireland . Baffling considering they could just unlike the page and never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why these people SHOULD unlike your facebook page by Alyssa ( a gem I 've met through this wild trip ) . <p> Following to unfollow . Frustrating and fruitless ! I am not a mass follower . I follow people in stages , over time on different social media platforms because A ) I like them B ) They fit into my blogs niche . If I do n't  get a follow back , I still follow them after all , I chose to follow them . If however their content no longer interests me or I realize that maybe they do n't  fit into my niche as much as I thought and therefore have no engagement then I will unfollow at a later date . Its not personal . I do not like the follow for follow mentality where I wake up to 30 new followers who unfollow within 24 hours because I have n't returned the favor . This is n't a game of you scratch my back , I 'll scratch yours . With social medias new and complex algorithms it is not beneficial to follow and have followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach and you will find yourself and your content buried at the bottom of the popularity pile . More gold I have learned through this experience . <p> Blog comments . This s a source of contention for me for two reasons . The first being negative comments . I 'm all for constructive criticism and debate on my posts but telling me I am stupid and selfish ( yes people take the time to write and publish comments like that ! ) is unnecessary . Not to mention , I am not going to approve such comments and display them on my blog . The second peeve here is comment threads . I participate in forums whereby I read other bloggers posts and leave a comment on them . The deal is that you read the post thoroughly and leave a genuine , intelligent comment . The aim of this is to support others blogs , discover new bloggers and build a network . Unfortunately a large amount of participants enter these threads merely for the number of views to be gained ( and I assume , money ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will find comments on your blog such as " great post , thanks for sharing " or " great tips " only to have spent five minutes writing an essay on theirs while it is evident they did n't  even read yours . Its as disheartening as it is false and a big lesson through this has been learning the importance of genuine engagement on my blog . I just stumbled on this excellent article by Gary Vaynerchuk explaining why your view count and social media popularity really means crap . When I first started blogging , the stats were the be all and end all for me . Now my main aim is connection and genuine interaction . I have cut back to only viewing my stats once a week to assess where I am going wrong and work on correcting those issues . <p> Plagiarism . My soul hurts as much as my brain does when I see a blog post that is identical to mine days or- just hours after publishing . This has happened to me three times in these past three months . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they read posts and regurgitate them on their own websites with no credit . I do n't  have the energy to battle it out with these people . But one in particular was someone who had a massive following . Its incredibly frustrating knowing hundreds of thousands of people are actually reading your content that someone else has hijacked . Where is the integrity ? The blogging world is over-saturated , we all know this but I firmly believe that using our own voices , ideas , opinions etc. can result in something entirely unique . I 've learned there will always be someone lurking , waiting to use your achievements for their own ego boost and the hard part is rising above that . If it becomes more sinister or repetitive , action may be taken and here 's how . <p> That is seriously enough about the negativity in blogging . I find it draining to even talk about it but these are the facts of the last three months . I need to give major props to the positive , warm people I have come to know over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends even in a military community . Whether it be cultural differences or the limitations of my visa process , I spent a lot of time on my own . One of the reasons I launched the blog was to put myself out there and open doors to new experiences . That definitely happened and although I have come into direct contact with more negativites than positives , it is the elation of the positive experiences and words of the wonderful , supportive people out there that keep me striving towards something greater . <p> If you want to test out your range of emotions and experience all of them at once I recommend that you start blogging . It is fun , it is draining , it is therapeutic , it is enraging , it is amusing , it is jealous , it is liberal , it is passionate , it is ignorant to list but a few . You are placed in a little corner of the world wide web and given a voice . You can use that voice to inform , help or upset others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but you are in this unique position to be heard which is sometimes difficult to achieve in real life . Sharing this piece of myself is scary but rewarding when someone says " I get it " . You can be as transparent as you like and conversely , as private as you wish . You can be a light or you can be the dark . The most important thing is that you are you . <p> Some days I still want to figuratively , flip over the table that is this blog and say F this crap ! ( *Amy OUT* Obama mic drop , style ) other days I feel like I want to change the world . Its only been three months . A lot has happened and lot still has n't  .

@@48796315 @2296315/ <h> Have You Found Your Blogging Voice ? <p> When I first started blogging I did n't  even consider my niche . I just wrote about what I was doing , my current situation , things that were of interest to me at that time , etc . I quickly discovered that to promote and connect with fellow bloggers my blog needed to have some type of niche in order to reach like-minded bloggers . I struggled with this definition for the first month . I was Irish , newly married and recently emigrated to the US . I liked fashion , food and travel but did n't  want my blog to be categorized so narrowly under any of these things . Getting my head around that mish-mash of interests and circumstances was hard for me and I found it difficult to , as the saying now goes , find my tribe . I came to accept that my blog is a lifestyle blog that focuses on a healthy mix of all of the above . But what 's more important is that I stopped worrying about fitting in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online , all telling you the importance of sticking to your niche and while that is necessary in business , if you are blogging for fun then my response to that is , " who said so ? ! " <p> After publishing posts consistently and learning what my viewers liked the most I started to settle into my own blog and became more confident when hitting publish . I was never overly confident that the content was good but happy with what I was saying and HOW I was saying it . Although you strive to give your readers what they want , it is of the utmost importance to write what YOU want , too . Your viewers have come to your site because they like you and your content , they will return if they love it . If they leave , so be it . More will come . <p> As I said in my last post , I have seen people switch niches a lot . There 's many reasons for going beyond the limits of your niche . Perhaps you are after getting bogged down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about due to changes in life circumstances . For example , you had a travel blog but are now settling down into motherhood and want to focus on writing articles on parenting . Or you have been blogging about college life but are now entering the working world . There 's an array of reasons to re-brand your blog but there is NEVER a reason to not be true to yourself in your writing . <p> Which brings me back from my tangential rambling to the idea of writing in your voice . Of course I do n't  mean voice in the traditional sense- but the portrayal of your personality through the words you write . You are unique and your writing style should be too . If you are a really funny and bubbly person but write in a monotonous tone with none of the humor you possess naturally then your content will not be authentic . And although we live in a world where we can fake happiness , good fortune and popularity quite easily via social media , your blog will expose a greater portion of yourself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on show , honest . Writing is powerful and people are perceptive beings . Posts repeatedly written in any voice but your own will be transparent and shallow . Your readers will not trust you or your content and wont engage . <p> The first thing I notice when reading blog posts , or any piece of writing for that matter , is the writing style . Now I 'm not saying mine is good . I 'm a serial user of cliches and slang which is considered vulgarity and terrible writing by some ( or most ) . In the world of professional writing I would more than likely be be condemned ! I do strive to improve my writing skills and blogging refreshes a great deal of lessons already learned about writing but when it comes to writing posts I often skip the- rules and mechanics of composing the perfect piece of literature as I try to write them as an exact reflection of myself and what I might say in a discussion with a real life person ! The wit , sarcasm , humor whatever you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is who I am . I 'm sure there are people who like my posts , those who can take or leave them and others whod rather poke out their eyes than read to the bottom . I 'm totally ok with that ! Well I 'd prefer if you held onto your eyes but I 'm fine with you leaving . Not everyone shares the same interests and opinions . <p> The way that I write , is genuine . The feelings I express , are genuine . My sentiments when I comment on your posts , are genuine . Being a genuine person is what I respect the most in any human being . I have no time for any single trait that is a fraction less than honest . <p> When I borderline stalk every social media platform you use , I love your blog ! When I like your pictures , I genuinely like your pictures . When I share your content , I really do think you have a message worth sending out . I like all of these things about you because you have probably won me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of you starting out , who maybe havent found your blogging voice yet , ask yourself before publishing is this for the glory of a spike in views , free products , money , etc. ? If the answer is yes to any of the above , then I suggest you save your draft and go back to the drawing board . <p> For those of you pouring your heart and soul into your blog and feeling like you need to start writing as someone else to fit in stop it ! Explore the boundaries of your niche , find new forums to join , freshen up your content but for the love of God , keep writing in your own voice ! <h> If you struggle with finding your voice , what is it about blogging that limits your authenticity ? <h> 37 Comments <p> I struggled to find a niche too so now I have just accepted that I do n't  really have one and I just post bits and bobs of everything . I do n't  think you categorise my voice either but I do try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this because I connect with bloggers more often when I understand who they are . When there are different voices under one name I can tell that too and it turns me off . I think being honest and sharing about yourself is key . <p> Great information for anyone starting out . Ive been at it for a year and just write like im talking to friends , because that 's how I 'll get my point across . I have a marketing background , so picking my niche was as simple as asking " who is my ideal reader " . <p> This is great ! While I was able to narrow down my niche for Natural Living I have a feeling it will expand some and on occasion I write the post that has nothing to do with Natural Living . The biggest thing I have learned just like you mentioned is to be true to yourself . <p> Amy , this is so great ! I can totally relate to a lot of the feelings you are going through . I 'm just starting out and am constantly seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't  really fit into a perfect niche and I think that is okay ! I cant believe your blog is only 3 months old it looks great and you have clearly found your voice . I 'm looking forward to following along on your blogging journey . <p> Best , Alex <p> P.S. Welcome to the States ! I have n't been to Savannah yet but it is high on my list of places to visit . <p> I completely agree with you . I was actually talking about this the other day ; when I was thinking of attracting more people related to my niche . But in the end of the day , I will write about what moves me , about what I am passionate about , and that , for me , is being genuine . As much as I 'd like to connect to as many readers as possible , I also do blogging for fun . So keep what you are doing , remain faithful to your true self : ) <p> This is a niche that I just love . I promote Strong voice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the same issue . What was my niche ? I did n't  even have a clue . I started writing to help others find their voices and learn that they have a niche and something to say that others would love to hear about . Great Post . <p> Great article ! Being genuine is 100% why I enjoy blogging so much connecting with people in an authentic way . I too sometimes find it difficult to place myself or the blog into one niche . Great read ! XO <p> Amy ! ! This is beautiful . Yes x10 . Authenticity is what makes a blog worthwhile . You can tell when people really care as opposed to when they 're just trying to give people what they want to see . Its easy to get lost in what everyone else does but at the end of the day , our differences are our strengths = <p> Great post Amy ! I do n't  really have a niche either but that 's because I like so many different things in life . But I also think its important to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is definitely what draws people and keeps them reading = <p> I 've often wondered what people mean when they say they like my writing style , but I think you 've hit the nail on the head with the personality thing . I try to just be me and write my blog as if I 'm having a conversation with someone . I prefer the same thing when I 'm reading blogs . <p> Choosing a niche for the blog is a struggle indeed because I believe that everything is linked to one another . I have a lifestyle blog and there are so many things that I can include in it . I also do food and travel related posts so I have just defined my niche by the target market not by topic really . <p> Being true to what you blog will naturally bring out your " voice " . I think , it is such a shame if well fake everything we put into our blog because one day , somehow , people will get to know the real us . And it is not good if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will be sharing . I was all over the place when I started . Now I feel a little more focused . I have my demographic and niche . I still write in my own voice but now I post twice a week- once for my readers and once for me , by that I mean Mondays are aimed at blogging and biz tips while Thursdays write about things I enjoy , experience have tried or just rants I find entertaining lol <p> Great post ! I changed my niche a while ago . Somehow had to do it . My personal life changed a lot and I did n't  want to be that personal any more and stopped writing anything too personal . At the same time i changed the name of my blog and unfortunately lost a lot of my readers partly because they could n't find my blog any more but partly because of its content ( I think so ) . <p> For me , its not blogging that limits my authenticity . Im introverted and have a hard time letting people in . My goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not " fake , " I just do n't  get very deep ( yet ) . I have lots of post ideas , I just need to let my thoughts flow and write them . <p> Great post ! I 'm trying to have some type of health , fitness and wellness blog as I 've been an athlete my whole life but its harder than I thought to come up with content for it As I 'm getting more comfortable in this role as a blogger I absolutely want to combine it with a youtube channel as well . Take care ! <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> . <h> Networks 123357 @qwx533357 123358
