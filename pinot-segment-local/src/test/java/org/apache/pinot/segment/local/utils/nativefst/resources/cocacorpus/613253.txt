Argh . <p> My fantasies this time around are two : <p> I 'd love to be able to put a number of different maps on a single 64gb SD card , so I 'm not always changing out cards . I seem to recall this being impossible or extremely difficult with the Garmin maps I purchased . <p> I know Basecamp is unsatisfactory in many respects , but I would like to be able to make the most satisfactory use of it possible , which includes easy ways to transfer maps , waypoints , routes , etc. , to and from my Oregon 600 . <p> Given these crazy fantasies , should I purchase the Garmin Tope 24K ( Southeast ) map in download or SD card format ? @qwx126745 @qwx126747 @qwx126746

It 's a single-channel multiplexing receiver , the same as the GPS 45XL marine unit . All of these receivers were essentially made obsolete 6.5 years ago when the Lowrance/Eagle and Garmin 12-channel receivers appeared . That was at the very end of 1996 and the beginning of 1997 . Unfortunately , it seems that the 90 was n't replaced by the GPS 92 ( 12 channel ) until 1998 , a year later . So the better model has been around just over 5 years . <p> Because of the large difference in performance between the 1-channel and 12-channel receivers , I 'll bet that most people have upgraded by now , and there are few GPS 90 customers left . At some point Garmin has to abandon support for old units . <p> I 've still got a 45XL ; it still works fine . I do n't have to worry about compatibility with new databases , since it does n't use any .

The Emap and the GPS II+ are fairly old , but they still build them because people still buy them . When people stop buying , they will stop building . <p> If the GPS-90 was still being purchased , they would support it . If not , they will drop it . <p> I sincerely doubt that Magellan or any other company would do it differently . <p> I personally do n't think that a new GPS once every six years is excessive .

@@9273749 @2473749/ @qwx126744 <p> Just to confuse you more , some maps have " grid north " which is not true north or magnetic north ! <p> Try to follow the logic of " how do I use my GPS " to answer your question . In my case , I use paper maps in the woods , and use a compass to walk headings between waypoints since a slow moving person in heavy canopy ca n't rely on the GPS to show direction of travel . I have maps with a true north grid . I have a compass that has a settable magnetic declination . So I set the compass for the 14 degree west magnetic declination , set the GPS to show " true north " and then all the headings transferred from GPS to compass or paper will agree without additional math . Of course , if your maps are printed differently , or your compass is n't adjustable , you may want to do something different .

Just wondering what setting should I use for North . <p> The GPS reads and calculates based on the " map , " with true N-S and E-W lines ( grid , ) just like you would if you were trying to determine bearings , distances , or whatever from a map . So it ignores the magnetic declination or variation ( with normal grid lines aligned N-S/E-W ) . Therefore you would normally set the GPS receiver at " True North , " or leave it at that default setting . Everything ( no compass is involved - yet ) so far ignores the magnetic variation effect . <p> Now suppose that you are using an orienteering map with grid lines aligned to magnetic N-S instead of true N-S . You will need to adjust the GPS receiver to work with this " variation . " So you set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variation are terms that are also used and mean the same thing . ) GPS read-outs now give you numbers based on your orienteering map grid . If a map has some oddball grid , many GPS receivers have the option to set a " User 's Grid . " <p> Now let 's bring in a compass , a much more common ( and necessary ) situation . All common compass needles point to the North Magnetic Pole , which is off in Canada somewhere , instead of at the Geographic North Pole . If your compass has an adjustment for the magnetic variation , look it up , set it , and now your GPS ( set at True North , ) common map ( with true N-S/E-W grid lines , ) and your adjusted compass all work together with the Earth 's " true " north-south and east-west lines , whether they are latitude-longitude , UTM , or some other " true " grid . <p> But what if your compass does n't have an adjustment ? Using just a map and compass , you will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compass , or plot ( physically or mentally ) the " adjusted " grid lines on your map . Remember , they both must agree . <p> Now you are thinking that the GPS and compass must also agree , right ? And the GPS and map must also agree , right ? And your thinking is correct . Whatever you use must be in agreement with the other components . That is why the GPS receiver has the option of " True North , " " Automatic Magnetic Variation , " or " User Defined Variation . " <p> Let 's use an example as a exercise ; You have a " True North " grid map , a compass without adjustment capabilities , and a GPS receiver . You park your car , and depart for the Lost Dutchman 's Mine ( marked on your map ) . First thing you want to do is " Mark " the car 's position . After you find the mine , and determine that you need some tools to get the gold out , you take a short cut back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position on the GPS , you use the read-out information to navigate back . If you also use your compass to set and follow bearings ( where you are really going is called the heading , ) what do you set the " HEADING " on the GPS at ? ( My 12XL says HEADING , and offers True , Grid , User , and Auto as options . ) ( A ) <p> Soon you realize that the GPS is ignorant of cliffs . So you decide to use map and compass . Are there any changes or corrections that you need to consider ? ( B ) <p> After awhile , you are not sure where you are , so you turn the GPS back on , locate yourself , and use the GPS readings to get back to your car . Was there anything you had to change to insure that you " bump " into your car ? ( C ) <p> Answers : <p> ( A ) Since you will transfer the GPS 's numbers to your compass , you should have your GPS set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the easier " Auto , " especially if you are n't sure what the variation is . <p> ( B ) If you orient the map based on the compass reading ( north points along north line ) , you need to adjust for variation by rotating the map the same number of degrees as the variation ( also in the correct direction ) . <p> ( C ) If you only use your compass with the GPS , no change is necessary , since the magnetic variation is already set in your GPS . If you still consult the map , it will need to be rotated to keep in sync with the compass and GPS . <p> Jim Stamm &lt;&gt; writes : &gt;Now let 's bring in a compass , a much more common ( and necessary ) &gt;situation .

A magnetic compass tells you the local direction of the Earth 's magnetic field . This field points roughly north-south , but not exactly towards either the geographic or magnetic north poles . <p> It 's easy to confirm this . Find the location of the Magnetic North Pole on a globe ( it 's currently at about 82N , 112.4W , about 730 km west of Alert , which in turn is at the northernmost tip of Canada ) . Hold a string between there and your own location . Note the angle between the meridians of latitude and your string - that 's the true bearing to the magnetic north pole . Compare that to your local declination from a map . <p> Here in Vancouver , the bearing to the magnetic north pole is 3 degrees . The local magnetic declination is 20 degrees . Clearly , the magnetic compass does n't point anywhere near the MN pole . <p> Or , if you 've got a GPS receiver , just enter a waypoint at 82N 112.4W , and " goto " it . Compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the actual declination from a map .

However , it ca n't contain the field in fine detail , so it could be somewhat off the true field . <p> To use the declination from a map , you should n't just use the indicated declination , which was valid only when the map was printed . Often , maps also tell you the rate of change of declination , and if you multiply that by the number of years between the map date and the current date and add it to the map declination , you get a more accurate estimate of current declination . This should be more accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed , but could be less accurate if decades have passed since the map date . <p> Then there are a couple of online magnetic field calculators that will estimate your declination based on more accurate models .

I think one reason I 've got myself confused is that I looked for such an indicator line previously but could n't find one . After some further experiment this morning I assume the reason is that it only appears if OptionsData SetTimezoneLocaltime is enabled . <p> My Garmin GPS 12 is set to an Offset of +01:00 ( for BST ) . I recorded a few seconds of track , starting at 08:16 . Then I downloaded it as usual to my PC with GPS Utility . The Time column , headed ' UTC ' , shows trackpoint 1 as 07:16 , i.e. the UTC time ( old-fashioned ' GMT ' to me ) . After saving it as Test.txt , my editor shows the first 5 lines as : <p> But on checking , I saw that GPSU had Localtime unchecked . After enabling it and setting it to +01:00 and saving again , that 4th line you described duly appeared . <p> I now realise that I 've naively been assuming that GPSU *automatically* records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Offset . Even now I 'm still not entirely clear about the effect of setting my GPS 12 Offset ? Does it change the actual data recorded ? Or - as it seems from my experiments - does that remain at GMT regardless ? IOW , requiring me to change it via GPSU 's Offset setting if I want anything other than raw GMT ? That would imply that the only value in setting it is to ensure its screen displays local time ? <p> As mentioned previously , in France I should have changed the GPS 12 from +01:00 to +02:00 . Another complication muddying the water is that my tracks were temporarily stored on my Pocket PC during the holiday . After each day 's walk , because of the 1024 trackpoint limit , I used G7toCE to download the track to my Pocket PC . Then I saved it ( for safety ) in two separate formats , ' Fugawi Trk ' ( . TRK ) , and ' Ozi Plot ' ( . PLT ) . Then , on return home , I synced them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Fugawi type prompted GPSU to display a message that rattled me a bit : " PCX5 file . Change File Saving format to PCX5 ? " But I do n't think a Yes or No answer made any difference to the trackpoint times . ) <p> The bottom line appears to be that I should have : 1 ) set my GPS 12 to +02:00 2 ) taken care that G7toCE was n't altering or overriding any offsets or other time settings in its Configuration menu 3 ) set GPSU to +02:00 before I opened the files on my PC . <p> Given all this , it 's tempting to work in GMT throughout ! But then all my photos ( taken on a camera with time correctly set to local time ! ) would then be out of sync &lt;g&gt; . <p> &lt;snip&gt; &gt; I now realise that I 've naively been assuming that GPSU &gt; *automatically* records the data recorded by my GPS 12 , including the &gt; Offset .

I now realise the GPS 12 Offset setting affects *only* the displayed time . <p> The NMEA standard for GPSr communication can work with multiple units connected together , e.g. data-logger , navigation controller , GPS receiver , radio comms unit , etc . You could not have different units , which may have been set to different time zones ( by accident or for whatever reason ) talking to each other using different time references . The time offset in your GPSr is ONLY for local display . If you travelled from Portugal to Spain you could set your GPSr display to the new time zone but you would not want your tracklog to show a one hour jump ! <p> The GPS satellites actually work in their own " GPS Time " which is the same as UTC but without the Leap Seconds that we people like .

Jim , <p> I 've had similar questions about double differencing . <p> Pseudoranges give a fine solution directly from single difference equations . In fact , if you solve single difference equations using elimination , you generate double difference equations in the first step . There seems to be no value at all in double differencing pseudorange equations . <p> The real power of double differencing is with phase . Phase equations introduce a new clock variable and N new phase variables . Even if you know your location exactly , say from the pseudorange calculations , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equations . <p> The double difference " trick " is , instead of solving for the phase variables j1 , j2 , ... , jn , you solve for the differences j2-j1 , ... , jn-j1 . You now have N-1 difference variables and you have the clock variable . With N equations , you have a solution . <p> My own misconception was thinking double differencing consisted of subtracting single difference equations . Instead , the essence of double differencing is redefining the phase variables . <p> I know my explanation is quite different from the textbooks . I guess I 'm stumbling through it just like you .

DDPR = ( PRroverprn - PRrefprn ) - ( PRroverhi - PRrefhi ) c . DDCP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPrefhi ) Calculating pseudorange position with DDPR can be done but is not very sensible since the ( added ) noise on DDPR is larger than e.g. the added noise on SDPR ( PRroverprn - PRRefprn ) . So the position scatter will be larger than in the single difference case . The fun is of course in DDCP . This observation allows sub-cm level relative positioning once the integer ambiguities are known . If your receivers are stationary , you can calculate the so-called ' float ' ambiguities by entering the SD position in the DD carrier phase equations . After some 10 or 20 minutes the averages of the float ambiguities may be close to an integer value . Then enter the rounded ( integer ) ambiguities in the carrier phase equations , and lo and behold , you now have ( pseudo ) range equations based on carrier phases and with mm accuracy , the basis for mm level positioning . This is an easy and very basic procedure . Not very practical , but it introduces one in an intuitive way into mm level positioning . @qwx126745 @qwx126747 @qwx126746

So &gt;all that the receiver would be able to see is the noise with no signal . &gt; Placing a GPS antenna outside let 's it pick up the proper signal in &gt;addition to noise and deliver that combination inside through a coax &gt;cable and then retransmit it from a second antenna placed close to the &gt;GPS receiver . &gt; &gt;So the key to their operation is n't so much the wideband amp as the &gt;antenna placed outside the building where it can pick up the GPS &gt;signals . <p> As others have noted the GPS signal is way below the background noise ( due to temperature of the antenna , etc ) but also each satellite is transmitting on the same frequency but with its own pseudo random code which I believe is 1023 bits long .. The GPS receiver time shifts the signal until it matches a specific code for a given satellite . Newer receivers do this in parallel so they can detect all visible satellites at once .

If you compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite , you will see that for some satellites the values increase every second , and for others the values decrease from second to second . You should be able to determine which is which by looking at the change in pseudorange values . Satellites that are getting closer will show are positive increase in carrier phase , and satellites which are moving away will decrease from second to second . <p> Wether this causes the overall carrier phase value to be negative depends on how the receiver initialises the carrier phase value . A common method is to start the carrier phase track off at zero when the receiver is turned on , and this will lead to negative carrier phase values for the satellites that are moving away from the receiver . <p> Thanks for the replies , Tom and Peter .

The direction of A to B is InvTan ( ( Be - Ae ) / ( Bn - An ) ) . If ( Be - Ae ) is positive that is East direction while if ( Be - Ae ) is negative that is West direction . Next if ( Bn - An ) is positive that is North direction while if ( Bn - An ) is negative that is South direction . So the result is a four-quadrant direction . For example S20E as a four-quadrant direction would be 160 degrees as a clockwise azimuth from North ... <p> Next calculate the distance Ds from A to B as the square root of ( ( Be - Ae ) 2 + ( Bn - An ) 2 ) . <p> Now , it was said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in elevation as Df . The vertical angle is InvTan ( Df / Ds ) . <p> Finally , if the situation busts UTM zone boundaries then ellipsoid inverse calculations for direction and distance are going to be needed . <p> I managed to solve the problem and generate an excel spreadsheet that computes antenna pointing azimuth and elevation from earth station and aircraft GPS ( WGS84 ) coordinates . <p> Although this solution seems to work well based upon some specific simple test cases , there are still some rough edges to work , including how to avoid trig functions ' blowing up ' as well as ' divide by zero ' errors that can be induced at certain latitudes and longitudes I may move to quaternian methods to avoid these annoying issues . Also I expect to utilize statistical or Kalman filtering to ' smooth out ' the dish movement commands which will be based on periodic updates of aircraft location . <p> The methodology involved first converting the GPS 84 coordinates to a cartesian ' earth centered ' coordinate system , then subtracting the coordinates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a cartesian coordinate system ( North , East , Height ) based upon the earth station GPS coordinates . I knew that this solution had already been done , and I was able to find references to it without bursting too many blood vessels . <p> If anyone has further interest in this solution , post a message here and I will be glad to follow up . <p> All in all it was a fun exercise that had me lurking in the local technical library for reference material , and brushing up on my matrix and linear algebra skills which have become a bit rusty from lack of use . <p> Regards , <p> Steve <p> steve wrote : &gt; I have been looking into how to compute Azimuth and Elevation from a &gt; fixed set of coordinates ( ground level ) to a moving set of coordinates &gt; ( an aircraft ) assuming both sets of GPS coordinates are known ( Lat / &gt; Long / El ) .

For example , if I 'm not wrong , NMEA outputs glonass satellites by their slot(+64) . GPS instead outputs the PRN . Basically with the GPS any satellite can have a PRN ( and so , an I 'd in the NMEA stream ) that is indipendent from it 's orbital position ; Glonass instead have ( al least it seem so ) the NMEA I 'd determined by orbital position ( slot ) . What can change is the frequency channel ( maybe ... considering that there is also the limit of the same freq on antipodal satellites ) . <p> Someone with more knowledge of the Glonass numberig scheme that want to help to clarify the situation ?

@@9273829 @2473829/ <p> SUNNYVALE , Calif. , May 21 , 2004 -- Trimble ( NASDAQ:TRMB ) today introduced the GeoRadio 2.4 GHz for surveying applications using robotic total stations . The new radio solution allows for license-free use in most areas worldwide . By using state-of-the-art spread spectrum technology , the compact , low-power GeoRadio 2.4 GHz reduces radio interference and resists jamming for superior performance on busy job sites . <p> By using the globally available 2.4 GHz Industrial , Scientific and Medical ( ISM ) devices band , the GeoRadio eliminates the need for licensing . Rather than using a fixed channel , the radio 's spread spectrum technology enables signals to ' hop ' over a wide range of frequencies . The sending and receiving radios change frequencies in unison , creating reliable communications over a spread of frequencies and reducing the vulnerability to interference , jamming and multipath fading . The Trimble GeoRadio 2.4 GHz uses the frequency range 2401 to 2470 MHz . <p> The 100mW GeoRadio 2.4 GHz system also provides a long-range radio link that reaches up to 1,200 meters ( 3,937 feet ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station , increasing efficiency and productivity on the job site . <p> Easy to use and versatile in functionality , the GeoRadio 2.4 GHz radio is controlled by the user 's choice of field software , whether it 's the Trimble Survey Controller , Trimble Survey Pro or Geodimeter CU software . The user can even switch the radio on and off through the software . The integrated solution can also be used with the Trimble ACU , TSCe and TDS Recon Controllers . <p> The GeoRadio 2.4 GHz is fully compatible with the Trimble 5600 Total Station Series and the Geodimeter 600 series and will be offered as an upgrade for existing users . The GeoRadio 2.4 GHZ is expected to be available mid-June of 2004 through Trimble 's Geomatics and Engineering dealer network . <p> It 's disquieting that the FCC has thrown so much " stuff " into the 2.4 GHz band ...

NMEA is a communication protocol that sends a series of current position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT used to transfer files full of tracks , but rather to ( only ) provide information on a second-by-second basis about where the GPS is and the signal quality - the software used to plot this current data is often called " moving map " because the map plots each current move of the vehicle or boat as provided by the NMEA data stream . The transfer of tracks , maps , and waypoints is more properly called a " file transfer . " If you go to the communications screen of the Explorist , you will find that " file transfer " is the first choice and NMEA position sending is the second choice . Somewhare in the documentation , I believe , is the notion that NMEA is a serial protocol . In fact , I do n't know if this is technically correct , or if NMEA protocol describes ONLY the " sentence " synax of the messages , not the physical link to transmit them . In fact , most programs expect a serial transmission of NMEA data ( like OxiExplorer , for example ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disk storage device on USB . <p> This seems to be the biggest problem with the Explorist series - a lot of users are not communications experts ( nor should they be ) , and are confused by the use of two entirely different protocols to transmit data for different purposes . In addition , there are differences between the Windows 98 and Windows XP operating systems that are significant ( automatic USB recognition in XP ) and not documented in the GPS manuals . Finally , the Explorist series may require the translation of some data before it can be used in MapSend . All in all , a very confusing situtation . After years of experience with all sorts of GPS and all sorts of PCs and software , I still ave to " fell my way " with the Explorist series some times .

Experience has shown that the recommended data format and message structure were generally sound , and that the 25% overhead required for the parity coding guarantees a highly robust channel for the differential GPS corrections . The results of usage of the RTCM SC-104 standard have been have been highly successful . While 8-10 meters ( 95% ) was originally targeted for shipboard applications , results have generally been better than 5 meters , often achieving 1-3 meters .

Governments have taken advantage of the SC-104 standard by prescribing it as the format for publicly supported radiobeacon broadcasts of differential GPS corrections . Scandinavian and North American countries have announced plans to equip their coastal waters with these services . This medium is highly attractive because of its inexpensiveness and accessibility . <p> The major revisions in Version 2.1 have been the following : <p> 1 . Update chapters 1-3 , and add a section on GLONASS. 2 . To allow service providers to define the meaning of the station health field . 3 . To fix some message types previously designated as tentative , and to add new messages which support real-time kinematic applications . 4 . Provide additional guidance material in Chapter 5 and Appendices I-IV . <p> There is additional work currently in progress to address messages to support differential GLONASS , provide guidance for interfacing between radiobeacon-based data links and GPSreceivers , and to provide standards for ground-based radiobeacons differential GPS stations .

Type 1 is computed in the base receiver by computing the error in the range measurement for each tracked SV . <p> TYPE 2 - messages are automatically generated when a new set of satellite ephemeris is downloaded to the base receiver . It is the computed difference between the old ephemeris and the new ephemeris . Type 2 messages are used when the base station is transmitting Type 1 messages . <p> TYPE 3 and 22 - RTCM type 3 and 22 are the base station position and the antenna offset . Type 3 and 22 are used in RTK processing to perform antenna reduction . <p> TYPE 6 - is a null frame filler message that is provided for data links that require continuous transmission of data , even if there are no corrections to send . As many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gap between two correction messages ( type 1 ) . Message 6 is not sent in burst mode . <p> TYPE 9 - Serves the same purpose as Type 1 , but does not require a complete satellite set . As a result , Type 9 messages require a more stable clock than a station transmitting Type 1 ' s , because the satellite corrections have different time references . <p> TYPE 16 - RTCM type 16 is simply a text message entered by the user that is transmitted from the base station to the rover .

@@9273853 @2473853/ <h> Trimble Fast Static Survey - Problem <p> Hi , I 'm using Trimble 5800 ( R8 ) GPS system with ACU . I 've been using it mostly for RTK . Now I need it also for Fast Static . Unfortunelly I can not start surveying in this mode . I can start base receiver without problem , but when I 'm starting rover receiver it stops on information " Staring survey " ( with progress bar up to c.a. 90% ) and it tells me " waiting for satellites , no survey " . Does anyone knows why is it like that and what I 'm doing wrong ? I can see 6 or more satellites so it should n't be a problem ? I 've clean also receiver 's memory and I 've checked all settings .

I created two different manual routes . For the first route I selected my brothers house in the suburbs , and from the City menu I selected Detroit as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alerted me I was near the Detroit Proximity waypoint . I had the proximity waypoint set to 10 miles , and my brothers house was 9.8 miles from the City of Detroit menu selection . The second manual route used a friends house . He is 1.5 miles from the Detroit border , but 10.3 miles from the City of Detroit location as found in the City menu . The alarm did not go off for his location . Resetting the proximity distance to 15 miles and using my friends house again caused the proximity alarm to go off . The location shown in the City Menu for Detroit is approximately 5 miles south of Eight Mile road , which is the border of Detroit and the suburbs . So the answer is to use the location you find in the Cities menu as the starting point to set the distance you want for your proximity waypoint . <p> " Roger Mundy " &lt;&gt; wrote in message news : ... &gt; Perhaps this question has been asked before , but I could not find the &gt; answer doing a search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proximity Waypoints ( the 76CS ) .

When choosing to use a proximity waypoint in the 76CS you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose from a saved waypoint , restaurant , hotel , cities , etc . If I choose the city of Detroit from the Cities menu it chooses a predefined location for the city . In this case the Boston Blvd &amp; glynn St area . That is approximately 5 miles south of the Northern border which is eight mile rd . Now if I were to create my own waypoints to put around the Detroit border and give them different names , I could use those 10 waypoints in my proximity waypoints .

The first two generations on TomTom ( GO classic and GO 300/500/700 ) used insensitive GPS chips that could not cope with signals attenuated by the athermic glass found in certain cars such as Citroen Xantia , Peugeot 607 , Renault Safrane , Ford Galaxy etc . But later TomTom models changed to parts made by SiRF that reputedly overcame those problems . ( Now that SiRF is losing a patent claim from Broadcom over the chips TomTom may soon be headed back to deaf . ) <p> One day I 'll tell the story about how I picked up a rental car at Zurich airport , my TomTom GO in my hand , and then drove off towards Vaduz ( Liechtenstein ) without a care in the world or a map in the car : - ( <p> " Walt " &lt;&gt; wrote in message LONG ... &gt;I am about to purchase a new Citroen Grand C4 Picasso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if this is likely to affect reception by my , &gt; yet to be purchased , Sat Nav ? &gt; If so , can anyone recommend a Sat Nav that WO N'T be affected ? &gt; Thanks for any help . <p> I have a Citroen C5 , My Navman PIN570 needs an external antenna ( or mount the it up by the mirror where there is an opening ) I also have a BT bluetooth unit ( ebay special ) which I sit just behind the rear seat !

@@9273905 @2473905/ <h> Auto Routing <p> I recently purchased a Garmin etrex Vista C GPS unit and also have the MapSource MetroGuide Europe software ( version 7 ) .

I have the Forerunner , and I do n't believe there is any way to change the default display of Lat/Long . Using the ForeRunner logbook feature does not help either . ( That program is terrible , but that 's another story ) . With the latest versions of the software , you are able to load the waypoints into MapSource . Perhaps you can change the display of the Coord. there via Edit Preferences Position Tab .

Another bad example .. I ca n't log different workouts . For Example , Running and Bicycling . They are all mixed in together . Would be nice to filter on just Running , or just Bicycling to see how you are doing . The Bicycling times make me look like I 'm running faster . Ahhhh !

Or , if you want to use GeoConv for track-reduction , you first have to use other means to convert MPS to some GeoConv-supported format ( PCX5 , Waypoint+ , OZI-explorer , Magellan , NMEA etc . ) <p> That is an interesting tidbit on active track versus saved track that I 'll experiment with on my own emap . <p> Getting back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route by hand in mapsource by looking at the track . I think the person who has done the route once can use their judgement in creating the route , rather than some clever computer algorithm . Not that I have anything against automation , but I think the task itself is just too simple . <p> I do n't know about the Etrex , but one annoying feature of the emap is that the gps will attempt to enter a route or track midway if there is a midway waypoint that is nearby . That it , the gps wo n't force you to go to the start of the route or track . This can be a problem if the terrain does n't allow you to enter the route or track midway . What I do is navigate to a waypoint that is at the start of the route or track . Once I am there , I then set up the GPS to follow the route or track . <p> I think Garmin wrote the software with the idea that somebody might start midway in a route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Eventually , the little connectors broke in the battery housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up that Garmin said it had been abused ! I got my money back ( with a little legal threatening ! ) and bought from another dealer . New on is fine and dandy . For my money , check that you have the latest firmware installed and just keep an eye on it . If it happens on a regular basis , get in touch with Garmin . But be very careful of the battery contacts ! <p> 1 The battery contacts are very fragile , and according to the original dealer , Garmin stated that the battery should not be removed ! @qwx126745 @qwx126747 @qwx126746

Both reference systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the accuracy of the Doppler reference frame ( about a &gt; meter ) . &gt; &gt; On Jan 2 , 1994 , a new realization called WGS84(G730) was introduced . This &gt; version was derived from the International Terrestrial Reference Frame &gt; ITRF91 . This was the point at which WGS84 was no longer compatible with &gt; NAD83 . The offset was about 2 m at the origin ( there was also a significant &gt; misalignment of the axes ) . The total difference in Canada amounts to about &gt; 1.5 m. &gt; &gt; Later , on Sep 29 , 1996 , another realization called WGS84(G873) was &gt; introduced . It was derived from the more accurate ITRF94 . Finally , in Jan &gt; 2002 , WGS84 was once again updated . This time it was derived from the even &gt; more accurate and stable ITRF2000 . This current one is called WGS84(G1150) . <p> &lt;&gt; kirjoitti viestiss+ : ... &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I am looking for a formula to convert coordinates from NAD83 to WGS84. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Could anybody help ? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks . &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my freeware GeoConv to convert between datums like NAD83 &gt;&gt; &gt; and &gt;&gt; &gt; WGS84 : &gt;&gt; &gt; LONG ... &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However , since NAD83 and WGS84 are so close to each other , you do n't &gt;&gt; &gt; need &gt;&gt; &gt; any conversion tools or formulae in this case ; just consider NAD83 and &gt;&gt; &gt; WGS84 equal ( at least for navigation and positioning ) &gt;&gt; &gt; ..... &gt; &gt; WGS-84(G1150) differs from NAD83(CORS96) by up to 2 meters depending on &gt; where you are in the US. &gt; <p> Yes , I knew that , but 2 meters is less than the average residual error in many 3D-similarity transformations between older datums and WGS84 . Therefore I said , that we could consider NAD83 and WGS84 equal at least for navigation and positioning . If one needs a conversion between WGS-84(G1150) and NAD83(CORS96) , that gives smaller residual errors , he needs to use more accurate transformation methods or calculate transformation parameters for a small area .

Even the very old Germany Roads &amp; Recreation will do . <p> Moreover you can use MetroGuide Europe ( version does n't matter , newest is v6 ) .

I do n't have the TOPO in Garmin memory card to know how the GPS can handle the whole map . So I guess it may give the option to select the region you want to use ( just a wild guess ) . <p> The key to doing what you want is to : - Install Mapsource , Trip &amp;Waypoint manager on your computer . - Purchase only Mapsets on DVDs , not on microSD cards - Install/Unlock the mapsets on your computer .

Since the original poster made no mention of seeing the ' Memory is Full ' alarm message I think it 's likely he simply ran out of the 2000 allowed trackpoints and erasing waypoints and/or routes wo n't improve the situation . <p> gps4less schrieb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific knowledge I will ask the &gt; question tomorrow of the garmin service men to see if they can she 'd any &gt; light on the message ( it may just be a common message for whatever part of &gt; the memory is full and there is no interrelation - or .... ) @qwx126745 @qwx126747 @qwx126746

I 've also got all the cabling on the bike to link to my &gt; intercom system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; &gt; Has anyone got any useful suggestions .. ? Are there any third party maps &gt; around .. ? I do n't need all of Europe , just the UK and maybe &gt; France/Germany , plus if at all possible the west coast of the USA , mainly &gt; California and Arizona . &gt; &gt; Cheers &gt; &gt; Ivor &gt; @qwx126745 @qwx126747 @qwx126746

For GPS - I found that particulary with Navman - unless you had a lock before you switched off and stayed in the same spot then - it took for ever to get a lock . So I either tell it where I am - then where to go to - or give it a reset so it finds the sats from a cold start . <p> So I 'm doing more cold starts that are necessary . I find the keypad entry a little small - but it works - I use hand writing recognition more than that - It took me a while to learn how to write to the pad - but now its faster than picking letters off the pad . <p> Look at settings - memory and the programs running - PDAs quite frequently do n't close programs down correctly .

I understand they will not be updating the maps now due to the cost of porting them for PDA which is really nice for a new ie 2 month old machine cost -140 before xmas . I do work a lot in poor signal areas in the wilder bits of Cumbria and the High Peaks so shadowing by the hills is an issue and what does seem to knock it out is ground radar I do work on and off airfields and once lost it takes yonks to re-acquire a lock but I will try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It is latitude/longitude with WGS84 all the time . <p> " A Garmin receiver will ALWAYS output W/R/T data referenced to WGS84 using Garmin protocol , and display using WGS84 if configured to do so " . It may be that the receiver stores data internally in a format that is independent of datum references - e.g. ECEF . <p> So , if you retrieve the data via Garmin protocol download , it 's always WGS84 , and if you set the device to WGS84 in the setup menu , it will show WGS84 referenced data . However , it does n't tell you how the data is actually stored internally . <p> Well , if you have gone this far into the depths of the unit it should be pointed out that all measurement systems , even ECEF have a datum reference . The center of the earth is a calculated value and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by WGS84 . <p> Dale &gt; &gt; So , if you retrieve the data via Garmin protocol download , it 's always &gt; WGS84 , and if you set the device to WGS84 in the setup menu , it will &gt; show WGS84 referenced data . However , it does n't tell you how the data is &gt; actually stored internally . &gt; &gt; - Carsten &gt; <p> You are mixing apples and oranges here . ECEF is a Coordinate System while WGS84 is a Datum ; two very different things . Most coordinate systems that the general user is familiar with generally fall into one of two categories : Angular , for example the lat/lon format we commonly use and Rectangular ( also called Grid ) , as in UTM or State Plane coordinates . Both angular and rectangular coordinates are convenient for defining a point on the surface of the earth . ECEF is a coordinate system used by the NAVSTAR system . ( BTW - ECEF comes from Earth Centered Earth Fixed ) . ECEF uses the x , y , z axis system . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the earth 's mass . Any point on the surface of the earth OR in space can be defined using the ECEF system . <p> A Datum can be thought of as a mathematical model of the shape of the earth . It defines the ellipsoid and the origin used by the cartographer when creating a map . Most civilian GPS receivers are able to display points using many different datums ; my Garmin GPSMAP 76S has more than a hundred .

Any mapping program that allows you to import your own map images should do this datum conversion . <p> Second , althought the NMEA standard *says* that the lat/long should be in WGS84 , some manufacturers disregard that . In particular , Garmin receivers report position in whatever datum you 've selected for the user interface . For this to work properly , the mapping program needs to do a double datum conversion , accounting for both the GPS reporting datum and the map datum . Some programs do this , some do not . <p> Garmin actually outputs the datum used for the NMEA output as a proprietary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacGPS Pro may read this datum and use it to automatically configure their datum conversion , with no user help . Other software that is n't Garmin specific probably ignores the Garmin private sentence , and so it must be manually configured with the GPS reporting datum . @qwx126745 @qwx126747 @qwx126746

AFAIK modern Aus maps use UTM but I think that there were other coordinate systems . You must also set the correct datum - this is very important since the difference between the default WGS84 and an older Aus map datum can be several hundred metres . Older maps use AGD66 or AGD84 depending on where you are ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones will probably use GDA94 , which I believe is consistent with WGS84 .

The station then transmits this information on a certain long wave band as correction data . A D GPS receiver receives the correction information and applies this correction to the signals received from the GPS satellites . With increasing distance of the receiver to the DGPS reference station , the atmospheric influences on the signals get more and more different and the correction get less and less accurate . If the distance between the reference station is large , the signals from the satellites travel through different parts of the atmosphere , being influenced in different ways . Even worse , due to the large distance the receiver may receive data from completely different satellite where no correctional information are provided in the correctional data . This effect where the reference station does not provide the right data for correction due to large distance to the receiver is called spatial decorrelation ' . Because of these phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 km with good accuracy . <p> For the SBAS systems ( WAAS , EGNOS , MSAS ) this is different . Here , the monitor stations do not provide single isolated corrections but from all stations together a correction map is calculated for a wide area . Every single receiver then corrects its own position itself by use of this data . That way , the accuracy that can be achieved is even better than with D GPS . If the receiver is outside of the area where valid TEC map data are provided , the receiver should use the build in standard ionospheric correction and then there should be no difference between WAAS/EGNOS switched on or off in the receiver setup menu in these cases . But since most manufacturers recommend switching WAAS/EGNOS off if not within the area where the signals are provided for , it may be assumed that the receivers do not make full use of all information provided and do not check whether the correction should be used or not . That way , the position may be even worse when WAAS/EGNOS is switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please , boys - all these ornithological references make you sound like my 17-year-old trying to suck me in to a serious conversation about Tom Cruise 's role in " Top Gun " .

Probably would be , but again it 's not Garmin maps that are being targeted but rather creation of own maps based on GPS collected data or data in public domain .

I would think not if you owned the map and only use GPS derivative yourself .

( Sam , are you sure it is ITAR instead of just a result of how the tracking loops work in cheap consumer GPS 's with limited CPU power ? &gt; Operational limits &gt; Altitude &lt; 18,000 m or velocity &lt; 515 m/s &gt; Either limit may be exceeded but not both ( in non-military GPS &gt; receivers ) . <p> This is ITAR . Not really " military " gps 's per-se just ones that need to be treated as munitions . &gt; These restrictions do not apply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GPS signals . You can always build your own receiver &gt; without restrictions of any kind . <p> You can also just change the firmware . That should be a lot simpler than building a whole receiver from scratch . <p> I know one open source phone that has problems making the software for the GPS module available because of ITAR fears . It would be too easy for someone outside of the US to remove the restrictions and in the past ITAR has applied to exporting easily modified software . <p> Now that I 've written all that , here is a thread from 2.5 years ago dealing with this . <p> On 20 Set , 20:14 , N.

@@9274065 @2474065/ <h> Replacing a broken screen on a 40lm <p> I got a " new " Nuvi 40lm ( new to me , though it was used ) , then promptly ... dropped it and broke the screen .

These 17 files are from the root of the first topo CD . <p> - Click on the file named setup.exe . MapSource installs ( again ) , from the hard disk . Only this time it knows to look in the location you installed from for all the topo maps . <p> - In MapSource , in the Select A Product listbox , or the View &gt; Products menu , you new see MetroGuide plus all the regions for the Topo maps . <p> - It 's nice in that once you select a location , you can jump between a Topo map and MetroGuide seamlessely . <p> On We 'd , 23 Jul 2003 01:10:00 GMT , Daryl &lt;&gt; wrote : &gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the West one that was &gt; already on my hard drive , but it did n't work .

The maps tab of MapSource will display how many MB 's of maps you have selected . Just remember you must send all the map segments as one transfer , subsequent transfers will overwrite the initial one . I do n't know how large the segments are in this latest version of his maps , but in the older version I have downloaded the segments seem fairly small .

Do I have to consider other factors and sentences as well , e.g. signal to noise ratio found in GSV sentences ? <p> Some receivers are designed not to generate a PVT solution if a parameter is out of threshold . My Trimble ensign would not give a fix if the HDOP was greater than 12 . SNR may be another constraint . Professional mapping receivers often allow users to set thresholds ( SNR , number of sats , DOPs , diff corrections , etc. ) to ensure that fixed meet user criteria . <p> Another explanation could be filtering , particular if you 're stationary . <p> Also note that you need a minimum of 3 or 4 SVs in nicely shaped constellation to get a halfway accurate position - a few tens of degrees above the horizon &amp; spaced evenly around the compass would be nice .

Does anyone have experience with the TomTom Go map data for Boston ( TeleAtlas ) ? <p> I realize that Garmin is coming out with the c320/330 models in March to address the usability issues for novice users , but a few of the routing screens do n't appear to show as much data as the TomTom ( from the demo ) . <p> Does anyone in the group presently use the TomTom Go in Boston with the most recent map data ? If so , how well is it working for you ? How up to date is it with all of the changes on I-93 and the Mass Pike connections ? @qwx126745 @qwx126747 @qwx126746
