Music fans could n't help noticing that the track bears an uncomfortably strong likeness to a popular song from the past : TLC 's 1999 hit " No Scrubs . " Did Ed copy from the iconic pop group ? Many listeners seemed to think so . @qwx162444 <p> In a surprising behind-the-scenes move this week , Ed seemed not just to acknowledge the accusations , but validate them . <p> Before we get to that , though , it might help to review the tracks . The biggest similarity seems to occur shortly before the first chorus of Ed 's song . He sings , " Boy , let 's not talk too much / Grab on my waist and put that body on me . " <p> Listeners on social media noted that the passage bears an uncanny melodic resemblance to the chorus of " No Scrubs , " when TLC sings , " No , I do n't want no scrubs / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love from me. " @qwx162444 <p> Beyond that snippet , the chords in the two songs are nearly identical , too . <p> In other news ... the chords to the melody of Shape of You &amp; No Scrubs are exactly the same . Ed got some splaining to do <p> Well , Ed apparently agrees . In the official music-rights database maintained by the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers , he edited the " Shape of You " songwriting credits this week to include the " No Scrubs " writing team : Kandi Burruss , Tameka Colette ( better known as Tiny ) and Kevin Briggs . Ed 's acknowledgement is n't just a symbolic gesture , either ; the " No Scrubs " trio now will earn royalties from sales and streams of his single . <p> Kandi and Tiny took to Instagram to express thanks to Ed for acknowledging their contribution .

The man is a legend ; even if you 've never watched any of his books-turned-films , you know they 'll leave you crying . @qwx162444 <p> His stories follow a formula : Boy and girl fall in love . The cruel and fickle finger of fate tears them apart . Someone dies . There 's a twist where a major secret is revealed . And then somehow " even if it 's not in the way you wanted " the couple ends up together . <p> You 've got to admit : Sparks ' formula works better in some of his movies than others . So here 's a definitive ranking of the top 8 " from the least satisfying to the most romantic of the bunch . <h> 8 . " Safe Haven " <p> Relativity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least best ) is Save Haven . The story follows a mysterious blonde woman ( Julianne Hough ) who flees her house in Boston ( holding a bloody knife " so obvs something crazy went down ) , buys a one way ticket to North Carolina , and settles down in the small town of Southport . While there , she lives a simple life as a waitress named Katie and falls in love with her widowed neighbor , Alex ( Josh Duhamel ) . @qwx162444 <p> Then ' wanted ' posters start popping up all over town warning of a woman named Erin accused of attempted murder . Shockingly ( not really ) the woman on the posters looks exactly like Katie . Slowly , KatieErin 's secret pre-Southport life is uncovered and the reason she had to flee her home in Boston is without-a-doubt compelling . @qwx162444 <p> It 's not the twist of Erin 's secret past that landed Safe Haven in last place on this list , but rather the twist at the very end of the movie that revealed this movie should n't be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a letdown when you 're looking for a legit love story . <h> 7 . " The Longest Ride " <p> 20th Century Fox @qwx162444 <p> This film starts with a guy falling head-over-heels for a girl from an entirely different world . Classic Sparks . <p> He 's Luke ( Scott Eastwood ) , a local bull-riding superstar on the rise . She 's Sophia ( Britt Robertson ) , a city girl with an art gallery internship waiting for her in NYC . It does n't seem like this budding couple have much of a future " or they would n't if this was n't a Nicholas Sparks film . <p> As fate would have it , on their way home from their first date , they come across a car wreck and rescue an old man " and his box of retro letters " from the wreckage . Sophia visits the old man , named Ira , in the hospital and he recounts his love story with his late wife , which happens to share a ton of similarities with Sophia and Luke 's budding romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ira 's sweeping period romance with Ruth , told through flashbacks , Sophia and Luke 's implausible love story pales in comparison , and that 's what makes this movie 's two-hour long runtime feel like a little much . <h> 6 . " The Best of Me " <p> Relativity Media @qwx162444 <p> This story is about 1990s high school sweethearts from opposite sides of the tracks who get torn apart by circumstances beyond their control during their senior year . Twenty years later , they reunite in their hometown for the funeral of their mutual friend and all their feelings come bubbling up again . <p> If that sounds oddly familiar , it 's because the plot sounds just like The Notebook . And therein lies The Best of Me 's biggest flaw : it 's insanely derivative , right down to a kissing-in-the-rain scene ripped out of Noah and Ally 's story . It even stars James Marsden ! <p> What The Best of Me borrowed from The Notebook , The Notebook did better . Like why did all the high school scenes meant to be taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( at the latest ) ? And although young Dawson and old Dawson were equally hot , why did they look nothing alike ? It was distracting . @qwx162444 <p> But do n't go thinking you wo n't need a box of tissues on hand while watching this flick . There 's a twist ending that will rock your world . In other words , even the weakest Sparks ' films are enough to leave you sobbing into your pillow over how beautiful and tragic love is. <h> 5 . " The Last Song " <p> Touchstone @qwx162444 <p> Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth met and fell in love on the set of The Last Song , so it goes without saying that their chemistry as Ronnie and Will was off-the-charts on screen . Sadly , this flick did n't have much more going for it than its star players . <p> But as predictable as all that was , I can get past it . it 's Ronnie and Will 's absurd reunion at the end of the movie that left me rolling my eyes . We all root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetched . <p> So how could I place The Last Song at number five ? Well , Miley and Liam 's chemistry is enough to propel it to the middle of the pack , and Miley 's song for the film , " When I Look at You , " was " The Climb " sequel we all needed in our lives . <h> 4 . " The Lucky One " <p> WB @qwx162444 <p> Zac Efron portrays the hunky main character Logan Thibault , which means this Sparks-gem is already on good footing . Logan is a U.S. Marine serving in Iraq who finds a picture of a woman on the ground just before a mortar attack destroys the place he 'd just been sitting , killing most of his comrades . Logan keeps the picture , believing it 's a lucky charm and later decides to track down the girl . <p> Logan finds her " her name 's Beth . But Logan ca n't work up the nerve to tell her why he suddenly walked into her life . She assumes he 's interested in a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances that lead them to fall in love ( this is a Nicholas Sparks flick , after all ) . @qwx162444 <p> As an audience , we already know his secret is A. ) kind of creepy ; and B. ) going to hella backfire once Beth finds out . And that 's this movie 's biggest flaw " you 're sitting there the whole time wondering why Logan would n't just tell the truth from the beginning ... @qwx162444 <p> Still , you wo n't be able to ignore the insane levels of steamy chemistry Logan has with Beth , played by Taylor Schilling . There 's an actual steamy shower scene that pretty much captures this fact . And as far as endings go , this one definitely has a twist , but it does n't come out of left field like some of Sparks ' other films ( see #8 ) . Barring the creepy-secret storyline , this movie is a solid pick for your next cry fest . <h> 3 . " Dear John " <p> Screen Gems @qwx162444 <p> Who could forget how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the first five minutes ? Channing Tatum 's John jumps into the water to retrieve a stranger 's purse and she turns out to be Savannah ( played by Amanda Seyfried ) " the love of his life . Obvs . <p> Of course , no love story is simple in Sparks ' hands . Even though John and Savannah fall swiftly in love , John is in the army , and after the September 11 attacks , he feels compelled to re-enlist . The couple are pulled apart by war , but they try to keep their love alive through letters . @qwx162444 <p> What Dear John does a little better than the rest of the bunch is portray a refreshingly realistic version of young love . John and Savannah love each other " there 's no doubt about it . But in many cases , life does get in the way of budding romance and , sometimes , the power of love is n't enough to sustain a relationship . <p> Do n't get me wrong , though : Mr. Sparks always gives you hope for ill-fated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . <h> 2 . " A Walk to Remember " @qwx162444 <p> Landon Carter ( Shane West ) is a wise-cracking high school senior who 's constantly up to no good , but when one of his school pranks goes too far , he 's forced to start tutoring after school and take part in *gasp* the school play in order to avoid expulsion . While serving his sentence , he constantly spars with his altruistic , exceptionally unpopular classmate Jamie Sullivan ( Mandy Moore ) , who 's determined to make him see the good in the world . Even though she 's the last person you 'd expect him to fall in love with " OK , who am I kidding ? You know he 's totally going to fall for her . @qwx162444 <p> I wo n't spoil the ending if you 're one of the three people in the entire world who has n't streamed this classic a thousand and one times , but of course there 's a twist , a tragic death , and a bittersweet ending . @qwx162444 <p> It 's formulaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes what 's best about Sparks ' movies and boils it down to the basics . Yes , there was a sweeping romance , but it did n't have to take place across multiple timelines to come across . And there was a twist , but it felt natural " not like an absurd ploy to shock you ( again , see #8 ) . <p> Jamie and Landon eventually feel like they could be your own classmates , and that 's what makes the ending that much more gut-wrenching. <h> 1 . " The Notebook " <p> Could any other movie be at the top of this list ? <p> New Line @qwx162444 <p> The Notebook starts with an elderly man in present day reading a love story from a notebook to an elderly woman at a nursing home . The story follows Noah ( Ryan Gosling ) , a poor young man who falls passionately in love with a rich girl named Allie ( Rachel McAdams ) the summer before she goes to college in the 1940s . Allie 's parents disapprove of this star-crossed romance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts . But when Noah spots Allie by chance years after they split up , he becomes to determined to win her back " despite the fact that she 's engaged to someone else . <p> You know how I said A Walk to Remember stuck to the basics ? Well , The Notebook is the opposite . It dialed all of Sparks ' tropes up to 1000. @qwx162444 <p> Of course , by the end of the movie , the elderly man and woman are weaved seamlessly into the story and their connection to Allie and Noah ( surprise ! ) makes their romance even more epic " and will leave you inconsolably sobbing on the floor . But in The Notebook , it works . Unlike many of Sparks ' later movies , every piece of this intricate love puzzle fits together perfectly , including the most grand twists " and that 's what makes it the best of the best .

Well , for starters , they 've got Emily Blunt filling Julie Andrews ' shoes as Ms. Poppins and Tony-winner Lin Manuel Miranda as the chimney sweep , Jack .

" This is n't an easy or cheap option , obvi , but when it 's an emergency " like , you have a huge whitehead on the tip of your nose the day before senior portraits " it might be worth it . <p> 2 .

In fact , researchers think part of the reason people hate the word " moist " so much is that it reminds them of vaginal discharge . ( Seriously . ) <p> Of course , we 're sloooowly starting to get past some of the weird taboos about periods and pit hair , so who knows " maybe someday discharge wo n't be such a hush-hush topic either . After all , discharge is not only totally normal but it 's actually crazy helpful too . " The purpose of discharge is to keep the vagina healthy by cleaning , moisturizing , and preventing infections , " says Stephanie Wyckoff , MD , an OB/GYN at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley , CA . In addition to keeping things balanced , it can also alert you when something 's out of whack . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 .

Stringy or stretchy <p> " Around day 14 of your cycle , you may notice a discharge the consistency of egg whites , " says Sherry Ross , MD , an OB/GYN and author of She-ology : The Definitive Guide to Women 's Intimate Health .

But there are a few other possible causes for the excess moistness ( sorry ) " like an infection , a lost tampon , or a reaction to a new soap . If it 's bothering you , let your doctor know . <p> 5 . Brown or bloody <p> If you just got done with your period , it 's likely leftover blood evacuating the premises . But if you have random mid-month spotting , or this is n't the first time you 've noticed blood in the mix , or even if you 're just weirded out by it , talk to your gyno " she can help you figure out what might be causing it .

Nonexistent <p> It 's okay if you do n't have any discharge at all " everyone 's output is different .

@@12930737 @1530737/ <h> 21 Things You Absolutely Must Know About Painting Your Nails <p> 1 . Three strokes are all you need . As you 're painting your nails , it 's best if you use three strokes to apply the polish . " First , you want to dip the brush into the bottle and get a decent-sized bead of polish at the edge of your brush , " nail pro Simcha Whitehill says . " You want the polish to do the majority of the work and spread out as it 's placed on the nail " the brush is there to just guide the dot of polish into place . Starting at the base of your nail , stroke the brush to the left , to the right , and then down the center . Voila ! @qwx162444 <p> 2 . Always use base coat . " It might take you some extra time , but it gives the colored polish something to adhere to , making your manicure last a couple of extra days longer , and it prevents staining on your nails from pigmented paint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip brush to help tidy up the edges of your nail . We 've all colored outside of the lines , but when you do it with nail polish , you want to be precise in your clean-up technique . Whitehill suggests dipping an old lip brush into nail polish remover and swiping it around your nail bed to clean up the edges . <p> 4 . Find the right white . White nail polish could n't be cooler than it is right now " it 's a super-mod , must-wear shade . But when you 're choosing a bottle , you want to make sure the formula is thick and creamy , so that it does n't go on too sheer or streaky . To make sure it 's opaque , take the brush and wipe it against the inside of the top of the bottle ; if the polish is sheer against the inside of the bottle , it 's not pigmented enough . One to try : Chanel Le Vernis Nail Colour in Eastern Light . <p> 6 . Swipe on cuticle oil religiously . " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the salon is to use cuticle oil , " Whitehill says . " It instantly hydrates them . Then , apply it over your entire nail after you 've painted your nails " if you accidentally hit them against something , the oil offers some slip , so they 're less likely to nick . " @qwx162444 <p> 7 . Hold your hands under cold water post-paint job . Holding your hands under cold water or dipping your fingertips into ice water for a bit helps them dry faster . @qwx162444 <p> 8 . Make your neon polish pop . To get your neon paint to be even brighter , apply a white or an opaque nude shade as your first coat of polish . Neons tend to be sheer , so this helps make them seem thicker . <p> 9 . Apply thin " not thick " coats of polish . Anytime you 're painting your nails , to get your polish to dry faster , apply three thin coats compared to one or two gloppy layers , because they 'll never dry . @qwx162444 <p> 10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place aka your fridge . Storing your nail polish in the refrigerator helps the formula to last longer . Especially since heat and sunlight can alter the thickness and color . <p> 11 . Thin out too-thick nail polish with thinner . " You can pick up nail polish thinner at your local beauty store " a few drops added to your polish that 's too thick is all you need , " she says . <p> 12 . Never shake your nail polish . " Instead , roll it back back and forth between your two hands , holding the polish vertically , " Whitehill notes . " This ensures there will be no air bubbles in the lacquer or on your nails as you paint it on . " <p> 14 . Only bust out the nippers when you have a hangnail . This is the ONLY time you should be reaching for the cuticle nippers . " Hangnails are inevitable , even if you use moisturizer often , and unfortunately the only way to get rid of them is to trim them away , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth when you file them . " Always stroke the file in one direction , otherwise it will tear the tip of your nail and leave it jagged , " Whitehill explains . " Filing them incorrectly can also lead to splitting , peeling , and breaking . " @qwx162444 <p> 16 . Stay away from hot water . " Do n't do your nails and then do the dishes or hop into the shower , " Whitehill says . " Hot water is nail polish 's natural-born enemy " it causes the nail bed to expand , forcing the polish to expand with it , typically causing it to crack in the process . " <p> 17 . Use non-acetone nail polish remover whenever possible . " Non-acetone is n't as drying to the nail , so if you have a problem with peeling or dry nails , you 'll want to use this formula , especially if you 're trying to strengthen your nails , " she says . <p> 19 . Use a cotton ball to help remove your glitter polish . Glitter polish is a bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whitehill suggests soaking a cotton ball in acetone remover , forming the cotton ball over each nail , and then letting it sit on your fingertips for a few minutes . " Then , gently apply some pressure and wipe the polish off with the cotton ball " the glitter should slip right off with it . " @qwx162444 <p> 20 . Always use three-free polish . Formulas labeled as such are free of formaldehyde , toluene , and dibutyl phthalate ( DBP ) " ingredients that can raise health concerns if you 're exposed to them over a prolonged period of time " are safer and healthier to be using over the course of your life , she says . Try brands like Essie , Butter London , and Deborah Lippmann to name a few . <p> 21 . Always use a top coat . And when you apply it , always swipe the very tip of your nail . That way , when you 're typing and hitting your tips against the keys constantly , you 'll be less likely to get chips .

Even though she loved playing Lizzie McGuire , getting people to see her as anything other than the iconic role after the show ended almost seemed impossible at one point . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na be , and after that " four years , five years after that " and I was still Lizzie McGuire to people and that was super annoying , " she revealed to Between the Lines . As much as you loved Lizzie , you can imagine how frustrating it would be if everyone always thought of you as your sixth grade self , which is basically how Hilary felt . But now that Hilary is older and has found success as a pop star and TV star post-Lizzie , she 's grateful for the experience . " Now it 's not annoying . I do n't care now . I 'm grateful for it . " @qwx162447 @qwx162444 <p> 10 of 17 <p> 10 . You start to outgrow the Disney Channel roles . <p> You go through a lot of changes during your tweens and teens , so it 's not surprising that as the Disney Channel stars grow up on set , they also begin to outgrow the roles that first made them famous . " Disney is a machine , and I 'm grateful for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I feel like being part of that environment made me crave the reaction from other projects even more . " The good news is , like Selena , many of your fave Disney Channel stars gone on to become the major fave pop stars and movie stars you know and love today . @qwx162447 @qwx162444 @qwx162444 <p> 11 of 17 <p> 11 . If you 're not careful , you 'll become a pop star . <p> Since many Disney Channel shows involve music and singing , it 's not shocking that many of the stars go on to become pop stars , like Miley , Selena , and Hilary , to name a few . But that 's not necessarily a good thing , according to well , at least one former Disney Channel star . When Even Stevens star Shia LaBeouf was asked if he ever considered himself the male Hilary Duff , he said no , but he could have been . " I never came out with a music thing , even though Disney will push you that way , " Shia told MTV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dig It " from Holes , now .

Zendaya and Bella Thorne can totes relate . " Zendaya and I were put in a very unfortunate position where we were kind of forced to compete against each other , " Bella Thorne shared of her experience starring on Shake It Up . " Which made the whole first season of the show just very awkward for us . We wanted to love each other , but yet we were constantly being put against each other . It was , ' Who 's better at this ?

Everyone thinks they know you just because they know your character . <p> While it 's amazing to play a character people know and love , it can also be frustrating ( and super lonely ! ) when everyone expects you to be that character irl too . " People start to think that because you come from Disney that you 're a certain way ... You 're perceived to be such an angel , and really you 're just an actor that booked a job , " Austin &amp; Ally starRoss Lynch revealed to CBS , Philadelphia .

The biggest pressure probably comes from trying my absolute best to please everyone while still trying to figure out exactly who I am .

So it might seem like booking Disney roles is a no-brainer once you get your foot in the door . But Alyson says that could n't be further from the truth . " The assumption is that once you 're in with the Disney Channel , you 're in . But I still auditioned for every single thing I got with them , " Alyson revealed on an episode of The Night Time Show podcast . " In fact , I was still sent on first calls with people who had never been on an audition in their lives , up until the end . Which was kind of frustrating . I was grateful , but then I was like , Man , I 've been on 12 shows for you and I 'm coming in here auditioning for three different roles and not getting any of them and it 's almost like you do n't know who I am or what I 'm capable of .

They give you opportunities beyond acting . <p> Debby Ryan admits that Disney Channel stardom came with some challenges , like fans confusing the real her for the characters she played on Suite Life on Deck and Jessie . But in an interview with Lady Gunn , Debby says her behind-the-scenes experience with the network imparted some amazing skills and lessons about the industry that she still uses today . <p> " They have such a system in place to where it 's really difficult to fail , but it 's not going to be done for you , " Debby said of Disney Channel 's team . " In my relationship with Disney , the more that I learned , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment that led Debby to apprentice with the network 's directors " and ultimately direct four episodes of Jessie herself . <p> " I just automatically started doing things to make the days go faster and easier , which turned into a huge learning experience , " Debby recalled . " If there was something I could do to make the shot funny and interesting , and to where we did n't have to shoot it 47 times I was happy to help to help . They took care of me , but they did n't baby me . " <p> Getty @qwx162444 <p> 17 of 17 <p> 17 . It can be hard to book roles after starring in a kids ' show . <p> As much of a big break as booking a lead role on a Disney Channel show is , Bella Thorne knows firsthand how hard it can be to book roles after your show ends . <p> " It was really hard to get a job after the show , " Bella revealed in this week 's episode of MTV 's Happy Sad Confused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to see me because they were like , ' She 's a Disney actress . ' For me , it was like starting back at the bottom and working my way up all the way again . " <p> That whole starting all over again thing can be frustrating , especially considering it was never Bella 's dream to be a Disney Channel star in the first place . " Do you think that I wanted to be a Disney girl ? Did you think I wanted to do that ? " Bella continued . " We were about to live physically on the street if I did n't have that role . We were living off Stouffer 's coupons , and that 's all we had to eat every day . That may not sound like a big deal to everybody , but when you 're a single mom raising four kids with debt and you have nothing to your name , it 's f***ing s***ty . " <p> " I did n't want to audition for Shake It Up ! " she added . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sing . I do n't dance . I 'm basically tone deaf , and I 'm not funny . So I do n't know why I 'm here . ' And everybody just started laughing . They all thought it was a joke . " <p> But it looks like it all worked out for Bella in the end . After all , she is the star of her own show now !

Whether it 's on your boobs , back or anywhere in between , body breakouts are The . Worst . Not to mention , dealing with below-the-chin bumps is a totally different beast than facial acne . Here 's the scoop on what causes it " plus , how to treat and prevent future body breakouts. @qwx162444 <h> The Cause <p> Acne is caused when oil gets clogged in a pore and it becomes inflamed , says Dr. Hadley King , dermatologist at New York City 's Skinney Medspa . Body blemishes tend to be red , raised and tender , and they usually pop up in areas that have a high concentration of oil glands ( like the chest and shoulders ) . <p> Your hormones effect how much oil your glands produce , so the more oil your bod makes , the higher the chance you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before your period are when your skin 's oil levels spike and could trigger a pimple SOS . <p> Another cause of body acne ? When perspiration and bacteria get trapped in the pores and cause infection due to tight or sweaty clothing . ( That 's why it 's a good idea to get out of workout gear after practice or a gym sesh . ) <h> The Treatment <p> Ready to zap some zits ? Here 's your clear skin cheat sheet : <h> Boob-ne and Chestne <p> Sports bras , tight crop tops or even your favorite bralette can give you a serious case of boob sweat , which can lead to blemishes . Try to get out of your top as soon as you can and treat any chest flair-ups with a salicylic acid toner ( like Neutrogena 's Oil-Free Stress Control Triple-Action Toner , $7.49 , amazon.com ) . Use it at night to exfoliate and reduce oil build-up on the congested spots . Also keep blemish-busting towelettes in your bag , so you can wipe away grime right after a sweat-sesh or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan for any zits that pop up on the upper chest as well . But , do pay attention if your spots tend to be more puss-like . There 's a chance you could be dealing with folliculitis , an infection of the hair follicles . " It can occur anywhere on skin , " says Dr. King . " If over the counter treatments with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide do n't seem to work , go meet with your dermatologist to see . " @qwx162444 <h> Back-ne <p> The struggle is real when it comes to back breakouts . Not only is it hard to apply treatment to your backside , but also the skin is thicker , making it difficult for acne-fighting products to soak in and start working . Back breakout can be triggered or amplified by your conditioner ( especially if it 's an oil-based one ) , which can clog pores , too . Make sure to wash , condition and thoroughly rinse your hair before cleansing your body . Then apply an antibacterial benzoyl peroxide wash with a body brush ( our fave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazon.com ) . With the brush , scrub the upper shoulders to make sure any leftover conditioner residue is removed . Afterwards opt for a lightweight zit-zapping spray such as AcneFree 's Body Clearing Acne Spray ( $9.34 , amazon.com ) since it 's easy to mist all over your back . <h> Butt-ne <p> Yoga pants and leggings are comfy , but wearing gym clothes all day can cause zits on your booty . " The tighter the material , the more likely you 'll have a breakout , " says Dr. Elizabeth Tanzi , Founder &amp; Director of Capital Laser &amp; Skincare . <p> The best way to treat flair-ups is with glycolic pads ( like Nip + Fab 's Glycolic Fix Exfoliating Facial Pads , $12.99 , amazon.com ) . The glycolic acid in them gently exfoliates and helps turn over skin cells on your bum . Avoid using a physical scrub down there since that can make acne worse . If there 's just one zit , dab on a spot treatment ( like Kate Somerville 's EradiKate To-Go Acne Treatment , $22 for twelve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comfy pair of cotton undies . " Cotton is great since it let 's skin breathe and wo n't trap anything in pores , " says Dr. King . Similar to boob-ne and chest-ne , if you do n't see improvement , go see your doc since it could be folliculitis. @qwx162444 <h> Arm and Leg-ne <p> First , make sure it 's really a pimple . If it 's a tiny red or skin colored bump that 's painless , it may be keratosis pilaris or KP . KP tends to be on the backs of arms and legs and occurs when skin builds up around the hair follicle . It 's a genetic condition and tends to run in families , so there 's a chance you got KP from your mama . It 's also more likely to affect people with drier skin or eczema , so use a lotion with urea ( like Eucerin Professional Repair Extremely Dry Skin Lotion , $9.99 , jet.com ) if your bod is on the dry side . It moisturizes and exfoliates at the same time without clogging up pores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eczema or dry skin , KP can still be happen , " says Dr. King . " If it does happen to you , treat it with a 12% lactic acid lotion , " says Dr. Tanzi . One similar to AmLactin 's Moisturizing Body Lotion ( $14.19 , amazon.com ) helps smooth out skin by gently turning over skin cells . And , if it 's definitely a zit ? Use salicylic acid wipes daily and opt for a pimple-busting wash in the shower . <h> When It 's Time To See A Doc <p> If your skin has n't improved after four weeks of consistent use of over-the-counter treatments , book an appointment with your derm . Why ? Body acne is much harder to combat than facial acne . Bodne tends to be more inflammatory ( think : big red bumps or cysts instead of just blackheads ) , making it challenging for drugstore creams to clear everything up on their own " especially with severe breakouts . Also , your body is a much larger area compared to your face . " It 's much harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you can on your face , " says Dr. Tanzi . <p> There are two main ways doctors treat body acne : Topical creams or oral medication . For milder cases , prescription level benzoyl peroxide creams or retinoids may do the trick . A retinoid is a treatment that has a high-level of vitamin A , which helps unclog pores . Aczone gel is another great option . Unlike benzoyl peroxide , it wo n't bleach clothes and it tends to be gentler on skin than a retinoid . But even with heavy-duty topicals , there 's a chance you 'll need something more to really clear skin . @qwx162444 <p> Enter : Oral medication . Depending on your needs , your derm may decide to put you on a pill to help . From antibiotics to birth control to other drugs such as spironolcatone or accutane , there are lots of options . Make sure you discuss with your parents and your doctor the best one for you then get ready to say hello to a blemish free bod.

In promotional interviews for show , Cole seems pretty hyped for his new role . There 's just one aspect of Jughead he 's not completely satisfied with : the character 's apparent sexual orientation . <p> Cole reportedly pushed for Jughead to be openly asexual but was unable to make it happen . " I come from an educational environment that really praises , as do I , the forms of representation that are otherwise lacking in our public media , " Cole explained . " But at the end of the day , I still had to do my job . " <p> That does n't mean a conversation around asexuality ca n't happen in future seasons , he was quick to note . " I think there 's still a lot of room in Riverdale for that , " Cole said . " Asexuality is not one of those things in my research that is so understood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that narrative could also be something very interesting and vey unique and still resonate with people , and not step on anyone 's toes . " <p> In fact , Jughead hooking up with women could lead to more authentic character growth , Cole mused . " I think sexuality especially is one of those fluid things where oftentimes we find who we are through certain things that happen in our lives , " he said . " If season one is one of those events or something like that needs to happen in season one for Jughead to eventually realize that kind of narrative , I 'd love to play with that too . " <p> A post shared by Riverdale ( @thecwriverdale ) on Dec 15 , 2016 at 10:02am PST @qwx162444 <p> Here 's hoping Cole gets the chance to tackle that storyline , as asexuality is virtually invisible in mainstream entertainment and widely misunderstood in real life . <p> For what it 's worth , Jughead sounds like a compelling character either way . " Society 's not been too nice to him because he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life has been pretty hard . He 's got a really super strong moral fiber and he holds on to that . He values friendships , and he 's super choosy about the people he let 's in . But when he let 's them in , he goes full throttle with it . " <p> Basically , Jughead is the anti-Cody Martin . But you 're probably going to love him just the same . <p> UPDATE 1/20 , 11:02 AM : It looks like Cody was onto something when it comes to Jughead 's future character growth . Showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa revealed to MTV that Jughead 's story arc could eventually address his sexuality . <p> " Cole and I have talked about it a ton , " he shared , confirming Cole 's earlier statements about fighting to portray Jughead as asexual . " The way we 're treating Riverdale , especially Season 1 , is it 's an origin story . So I think all of the kids are discovering themselves , and a big part of that is discovering their sexuality , their sexual selves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for growth throughout the series , apparently . After all , they are all just high schoolers . " Rather than have everything fully formed " for instance , we 're not going to start with Archie 's band or Jughead 's asexuality or any of the things that have become canon " those are all stops on the way to the journey until the show catches up to 75 years of Archie history , " he explained . <p> Basically , just because Jughead has romances with women in season one does n't mean that he 's straight . Irl , discovering your sexuality is a journey that can take years or your whole life , so it makes sense that Jughead 's sexuality is something that gets addressed over time . <p> Let 's hope that Riverdale gets many , many seasons and has the opportunity to flesh Jughead 's character out in a way that stays true to the comic .

Marlon 's wife Coral and all of their eggs are attacked by a ferocious fish , leaving Nemo and Marlon the only survivors . If you thought that scene was sad , this theory will absolutely break your heart . Some fans believe Nemo never survived the attack , and the movie is just an allegory of Marlon dealing with the stages of grief . The evidence ? Let 's start with the fact that in Latin " Nemo " means " nothing , " hinting to Nemo being nothing more than a figment of Marlon 's imagination .

If you 're wondering why we did n't mention the " Pixar Theory " <p> Most Disney fanatics are familiar with the intricate theory that attempts to connect every movie in the Pixar universe . But there 's one problem -- it claims that Cars is set in the future , when animals no longer exist due to pollution . But Cars takes place shortly after the construction of Interstate 40 , which bypassed Route 66 a few decades ago . As shown in flashbacks , most of the Cars characters were in Radiator Springs during its heyday . Most cars do n't last 20 years , so it 's unlikely they 'd survive from the mid-20th century all the way into a dystopian future .

Hairy nipples . <p> Do n't freak out if you find a few dark hairs around your nipples ( or more than a few ! ) . Almost everyone has some hairs around their nipples .

One boob is larger than the other . <p> Having breasts ( or nipples ! ) that are two different sizes is actually totally normal , especially when you 're still going through puberty . The difference may seem more noticeable when your breasts first start developing , and breasts do n't always develop at the same rate . But do n't stress . Your boobs will eventually catch up to each other , although they probably wo n't ever be exactly identical .

How else would we be able to watch Clay ride off into the sunset with Tony and Sky if those questions were left COMPLETELY unanswered ? @qwx162444 <p> The thing is , considering the book the series was based on was a standalone novel that tied every loose ending into a bow , viewers have been left wondering why the producers added so many subplots and details to the series if they did n't intend on addressing them definitively in the end . <p> And the answer seems pretty obvious : They wanted to leave the door open for a second season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " things were n't left open in the hopes of a sequel , " he also expressed interest in watching a second season and admitted he was n't allowed to reveal Netflix 's future plans for the series either way .

And considering the show is called 13 Reasons Why , it seems like there must be a new question that has to be answered in thirteen reasons to recreate the formula that worked so well for season one . @qwx162444 <h> What school tragedy will drive the narrative ? <p> If you watched the last episode of the series closely , it looks like we got a pretty distressing hint at what could be in store for the students at Liberty High : Tyler is planning a school shooting , or that 's what it looks like . <p> Toward the end of the series , Tyler is shown rifling through a trunk of guns he 's keeping in his room .

One might have hoped her tapes would teach everyone involved in her death to be kinder to the people around them . Instead , in the process of dealing with the fallout from the tapes , Tyler , who was already completely ostracized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like even more of an outsider .

If it is , it 's likely the producers will figure out a way to have Tyler explain why everyone made his list . <p> Perhaps Tyler will take his thirteen victims hostage within the school and the present-day storyline will go down over the course of one day as Tyler explains why everyone made his hit list in flashbacks ?

That is , if it 's handled correctly . <h> The question is : Should " 13 Reasons Why " even go there ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide should never be an option .

But if Tyler 's shooting becomes the driving force behind season two , he 'll probably be explaining the reasons why he believes thirteen people 's actions against him meant they deserved to die at his hands . It 's a completely different concept and one that 's infinitely harder to accept as viewers . <p> Besides that , while the tragedy of losing Hannah to suicide and the tapes she left behind were a great concept for a poignant TV show , using the same formula for a season two at the same school runs the risk of feeling like a contrived cash-grab rather than authentic commentary on teen issues . @qwx162444 <p> But who knows ?

" on your forehead . But keeping tabs on your period with free apps like Period Tracker Lite means you 'll never be stuck without a tampon in your purse when you need it " and you might feel better knowing exactly when it 's coming . " When you 're cranky or tired or bloated , sometimes it just helps to know you 're not crazy " it 's your period causing those feelings , " says Jennifer Ashton , M.D. , an ob-gyn and the author of The Body Scoop for Girls . Plus , docs say there 's proof that taking OTC meds up to 48 hours in advance ( yup , that far ahead of time ) will make your cramps significantly less painful throughout . @qwx162444 <h> 2 . Your instinct is to curl up in a ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should actually get off your butt . At least a little . <p> Listen , no one is saying you need to run a 5k when your period makes you feel like someone has drained the energy out of you with a syringe . But there 's legit scientific evidence that exercising to the point where you 're a little bit winded ( think : walking at a **37;102;TOOLONG pace ) will make you feel unbelievably better . " Exercise triggers your brain to release endorphins , which are your body 's natural pain reliever , " explains Melisa Holmes , M.D. , an ob-gyn and founder of Girlogy.com .

That boost is very , very temporaryand the comedown is even worse . " It 's OK to indulge a little , but what will actually satisfy those cravings best is whole grains or complex carbs , " says Dr. Ashton .

Resist the temptation to try a crazy miracle period drug . @qwx162444 <p> Avoid super-powered PMS drugs that sound too good to be true , says Dr. Ashton .

Instead , Dr. Ashton recommends green tea or coffee with just a touch of sugar , if you must . ( And have it before 4 p.m. so it does n't keep you up " a good night 's sleep is #1 when it comes to coping with exhaustion and crankiness . ) <p> Real talk : You 've got 35-ish years of periods ahead of you .

@@12930822 @1530822/ <p> The great thing about movie remakes is that the filmmakers get to go back and repair all the plot holes that accidentally ended up in the original . The new Beauty and the Beast is no exception " it fixes a bunch found in its 1991 predecessor . But in doing so , the film may have accidentally created a NEW plot hole ... or not , if you believe a wild new fan theory making the rounds this week . @qwx162444 <p> *SPOILERS AHEAD* <p> The biggest plot hole in the original movie was pretty glaring : The people in Belle 's village somehow were completely unaware of the Beast 's castle " an enormous royal structure looming right next to their town " until Belle ended up captive there . <p> The new movie patches this up with a quick little detail . We learn that the enchantress cursed the townspeople , too , causing them to forget that the prince , the castle , and its inhabitants ever existed . Simple ! <p> Except this change seemed to open up a whole new incongruity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his servants did n't age . As an example , look at Chip : He 's still a young child when he regains his human form at the end of the movie . @qwx162444 <p> Fair enough , but the weird thing is that people outside the castle did n't seem to age , either . For instance , when Mrs. Potts changes back from a teapot to be reunited with Mr. Potts from the village , both spouses look to be about the same age as one another . How could that be ? <p> " The village of Villaneuve is caught in the Enchantress ' curse as well , " Hainted wrote . In other words , the enchantress did n't just erase memories of the prince and his castle ; she also " locked the village in a time loop . " In a nutshell , nobody ages because they live the same day over and over again . <p> If you think about it , the theory kind of makes sense . Why is Belle able to breeze through the village 's crowded marketplace without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do . Belle even remarks that the town baker always has the same goods . <p> According to the theory , Belle and her father , Maurice , are exempt from the curse because they moved to town after it took effect . And the reason the townsfolk find them odd is because they age normally with the passing years . <p> So there you have it : the possible reason the villagers are so judgey and predictable . More incentive to reverse the curse !

You wan na stay in bed foreverrrrrrrr . <p> Even the chillest girl has the occasional morning where she just does n't want to face the day . But if you 're repeatedly feeling too freakin ' drained to rip yourself from the covers ( a crazy combo of physical exhaustion and emotional NOOOOO ! ) , it 's time to take stock of the worries that may be weighing you down . " Stress is an energy-drainer , because it secretly sends all of your body systems into overdrive , " says Jane Pernotto Ehrman , M.Ed , a behavioral health specialist at Cleveland Clinic 's Wellness Institute . @qwx162444 <h> 2 . One catch with the *so tired* thing ? You ca n't actually sleep . <p> Another legit reason that stress is making you wake up feeling like death : You spent a good chunk of the previous night tossing/turning/wishing your brain would just TURN OFF ALREADY . " I call it ' wired and tired , ' " explains Lucie Hemmen , Ph.D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Practice bumps back homework , which bumps back bedtime " and by the time you 're ready to go to sleep , you 've pushed yourself past the point of exhaustion . " Real talk : That wired feeling may be a sign that sneaky stress hormones are pumping through your body at unhealthy levels , just to help you survive your ridic day . And when you 're experiencing that crap-night-of-sleep cycle on repeat ? It 's maybe time to give your schedule some breathing room . @qwx162444 <h> 3 . You 're legit sick , like , every other day . <p> When you 're in high-stress mode , your immune system can be suppressed up to 30% " making you more likely to catch every single cold or flu that 's circulating around your school .

Your memory goes fuzzy , your focus becomes non-existent , and your ability to actually listen gets squashed . It 's like stress hijacks your brain . <h> 5 . Your head feels all sorts of tight and/or explode-y . <p> OK , think about the last time someone spooked you : Your shoulders instantly scrunched up , right ? And your neck muscles tightened ? Well , that response to danger actually dates way back to caveman days : " It 's an animal instinct to protect the jugular , " says Ehrman .

If it was stored in a hot place ( like a glove compartment ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidentally ripped it with your teeth or nails while opening the wrapper , or if you use the same condom more than once ( never do this ! ) . @qwx162444 <p> Some girls are allergic to latex : Condoms are typically made of a material called latex , and about one to six percent of the general population is allergic to it , according to the Centers for Disease Control . ( That stat goes up to 8 to 12 percent for people who wear latex gloves frequently , like doctors and nurses . ) If you 're only mildly allergic , you might develop red skin , hives or itching . More severely allergic people can develop a runny nose , sneezing , itchy eyes , a scratchy throat , and in very rare cases , go into anaphylactic shock . If you happen to have a latex allergy , it 's still possible to use condoms " you just need to buy the non-latex kind . Find them at your local drugstore ( $14 at Walgreens ) . Non-latex condoms are about three percent more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when putting them on . <p> You need to be prepared : Unlike the IUD or the Depo-Provera shot , you actually need to carry condoms with you if they 're your chosen method of birth control . Girl 's got ta be ready . It sounds obvious , but no condom = no sex . <h> Who They 're Best For : <p> Again , condoms are the only form of birth control that can protect against STIs . They 're a must if you or your partner are sexually active with more than one person , or if you or your partner have n't both tested negative for STIs . Other methods of birth control tend to require visits to your doctor or a clinic , so if you 're concerned with cost or health insurance , condoms are an awesome alternative . <h> PROS <p> More regular periods : One of the main perks of going on the Pill is that once your body adjusts ( which can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months ) , you 'll be able to predict exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your period : Hate getting your period every month ? Some versions of the Pill only cause you to bleed a couple times a year , Dr. Brightman says . <p> Clearer skin : Dermatologists often prescribe the Pill to girls who struggle with acne . The Pill is packed with the hormone estrogen , which suppresses androgen , the hormone that causes extra oil production , which leads to zits . The FDA has approved three types of the Pill for acne treatment " Ortho Tri-Cyclen , Estrostep , and YAZ. @qwx162444 <h> CONS <p> It does n't protect against STIs : Only condoms do that . Unless you and your partner are exclusively monogamous ( and you trust them ! ) and you 've both tested negative for STIs , you should still use condoms " even if you 're on the Pill . <p> You have to take it at the same time every day : In order for the Pill to be effective , you need to take it at approximately the same time every day " preferably within an hour or two " in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially important if you 're taking a low-estrogen , progestin-only , or mini version of the Pill , all of which are more sensitive . " For young women who have trouble remembering other medications , or to do things on a regular basis , perhaps birth control pills are not the best choice for them , " Dr. Brightman says . <p> It may put you at risk for clotting : If you have a family history of clotting while on the Pill or pregnant , this method of birth control can be dangerous for you , Dr. Brightman advises . Instead , opt for condoms , an IUD , or the Depo-Provera shot . <p> You need a prescription from a health care provider : That means you need to schedule an appointment with your doctor or visit your local clinic . If you get a prescription , it 'll likely show up on your parents ' health insurance , so it 's a good idea to discuss going on the Pill with your parents first . ( Awkward ? Maybe , at first . Important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Definitely . ) <h> Who It 's Best For : <p> The Pill is an effective way to prevent pregnancy , regulate your period , and for many , improve your skin . If you 're comfortable with the responsibility of taking the Pill at the same time every day and do n't have a family history of blood clots in women who are on the Pill or pregnant , it could be the right method of birth control for you . If , however , you 're worried that an appointment with your doctor or clinic will lead to unwanted charges on your parents ' health insurance , the Pill might not be the best option for you at the moment , but it 's worth revisiting if you become comfortable with talking to your parents about going on birth control . @qwx162444 <h> An IUD <p> An IUD ( intrauterine device ) is a small , T-shaped piece of plastic that a doctor can insert into your uterus for long-lasting pregnancy prevention . IUDs are 99 percent effective at preventing pregnancy . Unlike other methods of birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no possible way to use it incorrectly . <h> PROS <p> You can be protected for years : You still need to be conscious about preventing STIs , but when it comes to preventing pregnancy , you 'll be safe for years to come . Depending on the type of IUD you choose , you can be protected from pregnancy for up to two , three , five , or 10 years . If you want your IUD removed , no problem " your doctor can remove it at any time . @qwx162444 <p> Better periods ( maybe ) : There are two types of IUDs : hormonal and non-hormonal . Hormonal IUDs contain the hormone levonorgestrel , which changes your uterine lining to create much lighter periods . Some girls also find they stop getting cramps with this type of device . Non-hormonal IUDs keep your periods about the same , or slightly heavier , and you might experience a few more cramps . <h> CONS <p> Itdoes n't protect against STIs : Only condoms can do that . Unless you and your partner are exclusively monogamous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both tested negative for STIs , you should still use condoms " even if you have an IUD . <p> Insertion can be uncomfortable : Dr. Brightman describes the sensation as " a very strong period cramp , " plus a crampy feeling immediately afterward . If you 're worried about the pain , she says you can take two Advils or Aleves before your appointment . That said , Dr. Brightman says her younger patients are actually tougher when it comes to dealing with the discomfort than her older patients who have had children ! <p> Unpredictable bleeding : Your bleeding might become unpredictable " aka you might not get your period when you expect it to come . That can be a little disconcerting at first , but in Dr. Brightman 's experience , she 's never seen a patient with a hormonal IUD ever get pregnant . <p> The cost : The IUD is the most expensive method of birth control in terms of up-front costs , but many people find it to be a cost-effective choice over the years . Between the cost of insertion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple hundred dollars . ( The exact price that you or your parents would pay depends on your insurance . ) <h> Who It 's Best For : <p> If remembering to buy condoms or taking the Pill sounds like a lot of work to you , the IUD is a minimal effort solution to preventing pregnancy . Hormonal IUDs have the added benefit of easier-to-manage periods , so they 're also worth talking to your doctor about if you experience heavy periods and cramps . Since this form of birth control requires a visit to your doctor or a local clinic and it 's a costly procedure that will show up on your health insurance , you might want your parents on-board with your decision . Your mom might feel iffy about IUDs at first , but let her know that today 's IUDs are totally safe and popular " not like the more dangerous versions of decades past . @qwx162444 <h> The Depo-Provera Shot <p> The Depo-Provera shot is a form of birth control that 's injected into your muscle ( like a vaccine ) and lasts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of when you start your period . If you get the shot injected at regular 12-week increments during the first five days of your period , it 's more than 99 percent effective at preventing pregnancy . But if you do n't get the shot in regular 12-week increments , that figure translates to 94 percent effective . @qwx162444 <h> PROS <p> It lasts for three months : Once you have the shot , you should use condoms as a back-up method for the first week , and then you 're free to have sex without fear of getting pregnant for the remainder of the next three months . <h> CONS <p> It does n't protect against STIs : Only condoms can do that . Unless you and your partner are exclusively monogamous ( and you trust them ! ) and you 've both tested negative for STIs , you should still use condoms " even if you 've gotten the shot . <p> It lasts for three months : Yep , it can be both a pro and a con . If you experience any negative side-effects ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moodiness ) , you 'll have to deal with them until the shot wears off . <p> It 's not safe for long-term use : Long-term use is associated with a loss of bone density . While the shot might be the right solution for you now , you want to consider other methods of birth control for later in life . Your doctor will be able to recommend exactly how long it 's safe for you to use the shot . <h> Who It 's Best For : <p> If remembering to buy condoms or taking the Pill sounds like a lot of work to you , the shot is a minimal effort solution to preventing pregnancy . However , the shot is only advisable if you 're ready for the responsibility of making regular doctor 's appointments every 12 weeks . If that sounds like more trouble than it 's worth to you , a different form of birth control would be a better fit for your lifestyle .

@@12930934 @1530934/ <h> The Punishment For Being Mean to Your Starbucks Barista <p> This week , when the Internet gave us this viral video that parodies why Starbucks baristas really spell names ridiculously wrong , everyone who has ever walked into a Starbucks had a good laugh . Real Starbucks baristas laughed even harder . Turns out , the joke is pretty close to the truth . One assistant manager talked to our friends at Cosmopolitan.com about how she finds the greatest joy in the everyday way she messes with her customers . " I really love my job , " she says . <p> How often do you intentionally spell someone 's name wrong on his or her coffee cup ? Most mornings , I do it just to mess with people . I love to see their reactions . But my regulars have come to love it . I have a lot of Jessicas that come in , and I 've done every variation on that name you can imagine . In fact , I 've done just about every name that the video shows . <p> Has anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular customer named Bob , and the first time I spelled his name Boob , I went even further . I yelled it as loud as I could , " Boob , your latte is ready , BOOB ! " He did n't really care for that . He made a little scene , and my manager gave him a free drink to calm him down . Now he has a sense of humor about it . Now , when he walks in with a scowl on his face , I spell his name " Boob , " just to give him a little smile . <p> How often do people complain about the misspellings ? I never really get many complaints about the name being wrong ; it 's normally about the drink being wrong . There was one girl who said her name so fast I had no idea what she said . I asked her to repeat it a few times , and I still could n't figure it out . Then I realized it was Shaniqua . I have no idea how to spell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it out . " Hey , Shaq , here 's your caramel macchiato ! " She just gave me a dirty look and said , " Really , Shaq ? " I smiled and she left . She still comes in all the time . @qwx162444 <p> Is this an unwritten barista code of conduct ? Does every barista do this ? I do n't know if everyone does it , but when I asked my manager if she does , she admitted most Starbucks employees use it as a marketing tool . Most people are n't going to post a photo to social media of a cup with their name spelled right . I just use it as a way to be funny , but now I get why people use it as a way to promote the business . <p> How else do you entertain yourself at work that annoys customers ? Sometimes the whole staff will gather together with espresso shots and sing " Shots " by LMFAO at the top of our lungs . We are extremely loud . Sometimes people sing along " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Do you ever give regular milk to someone who asks for skim ? Oh yeah , all the time . And we 'll give them regular espresso shots when they ask for decaf . I do n't do it if someone is being nice , and I 'd never give a caffeinated drink to someone who was pregnant if they did n't order it . But if someone is being pushy or rude , I do it . For example , I 'll be making a drink and someone looks over the partition and asks , " Did you push the decaf button ? Wait , I think the decaf button is over there . " One time a customer actually tried to come behind the counter to verify where the decaf shots are located . I was like , " Sir , you can not come back here . " He said , " I just always see you guys push different buttons back here , and I just want to know where the right one is . " And you know what ? Now you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe even a double . @qwx162444 <p> Have you ever spit in a drink ? Oh no , I would never do that . Besides , we have cameras on us all the time . <p> Has anyone ever made you so angry that you wanted to spit in his or her drink ? A customer made me cry once . It was late , and I was closing by myself . She was a larger woman with a very loud voice . She comes in talking on her phone and orders a green tea latte . She did n't specify if she wanted it hot or iced or what kind of milk she wanted , and she would n't listen to me . So I rang her up for a hot one and gave it to her . She took a sip and spit it out on the counter . She said , " Is this nonfat ? Is this sugar-free ? Is this 180 degrees ? " I said , " I did n't know what you wanted . I can remake it . " Her reply : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she tasted it , shrugged , and said , " This will do , " and left . She comes back to the store 20 minutes later and says the drink is horrible and demands a new one . I opened the lid , and it 's a cup full of cold milk . Our green tea lattes are really green from the matcha powder we use . I started to make her a new one and asked , " So , what happened to the matcha in there ? " and she snapped at me : " Are you seriously questioning me ? You 'd better make my latte , bitch ! " I started to cry , and she kept terrorizing me . It was awful . But I still would n't have spit in her drink . I do n't want to intentionally hurt anyone in any way . <p> How much coffee do you drink a day ? If I 'm working , I usually have my trenta-size coffee , and I 'll get my free refill as well and drink it throughout the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I also get a hot mocha when I leave . <p> Do you have trouble sleeping ? It 's weird . Some days , I could drink a quad shot of espresso and go right to sleep . Or I could drink a double shot and be awake all night . @qwx162444 <p> What are your favorite drinks and snacks Starbucks offers ? I like a caramel macchiato , mocha vanilla , or chai vanilla . And I really like the pumpkin cream cheese muffins . <p> Do you come home reeking of coffee smell ? Yes . I have to shower and wash my clothes right away . But I do n't think I 'll ever really get sick of the smell . <p> It 's fall , so Starbucks is pushing the pumpkin spice latte hard . How do you really feel about it and the other holiday drinks ? I personally really love the pumpkin spice latte . But I get it with half the syrup because I do think it 's on the sweet side . If it 's made correctly , I could drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our best drinks . I 'm not really a fan of the gingerbread latte though . <p> Do you ever tell customers if you do n't like a drink ? I do , but I tell them it 's my opinion first . Then I 'll have another barista who maybe likes it give their opinion too . I 'd rather them hear how I feel than buy a $5 drink , hate it , and we have to make something else . <p> What 's the best type of customer ? <p> I love my regulars or anyone willing to spend their time talking to me so I can learn their likes and dislikes . I also really like customers who try samples . I do n't know why customers do n't want to try samples . It 's free . <p> Can you ask to sample anything in the store even if you 're not offering it up in those tiny cups ? Yes , you can ask to sample anything . Just do n't tell me you do n't know what a Frappuccino tastes like and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making Frappuccinos because it has the most steps out of every drink . I 'll make the samples for you , but I 'm kind of annoyed with you now . The type of person who would ask for that is also the type of person who would ask for it when I 'm clearly really busy . <p> What 's the worst type of customer ? Someone who comes in on their phone and expects me to know what they want just by glancing at them . So , is it a grande nonfat latte ? No ? Hello ? And then I get a dirty look . Or anyone who slams their money down on the counter . It 's one of my pet peeves . I held my hand out here gently for a reason , you know . Impatient customers are annoying too . Anyone tapping their foot or jangling their keys . Just stop it . And the OCD inspectors " someone who orders a caramel macchiato layered but then asks why it 's not stirred up . <p> Do you correct people when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice way . If someone says a large , and I grab a vente , then they say they want a " large large , " I 'll say , " Oh , you want the trenta size . " A big annoyance for all of us is when people put an X in espresso . And everyone calls our Frappuccinos " frappes , " like at McDonald 's . Eww , this is not McDonald 's . <p> Do the people who hand out the coffee get upset when the customer has disappeared ? Do we have a fit ? Not necessarily . If it 's really busy , we freak out when someone else takes it because then we have to remake it and put it at the top of the list . Normally , we just call it out every couple of minutes because that person could be on the phone or in the bathroom . After five minutes , we pull it to the side , re-steam it if it 's a hot drink , or add more ice to an iced one . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normally , I 'll offer it if someone wants it . Or I 'll put it in little sample cups . But if it 's something with a lot of different changes in it " like black tea with a shot of espresso , soy milk , and sugar-free vanilla " no one wants to try that . So I 'll throw it out . @qwx162444 <p> What has been the most annoying drink order ? I have it memorized . There 's a customer who came in a couple of weeks ago and asked for one of our cups , then she took out a pen and drew out exactly what she wanted : six pieces of ice , a shot on top of that , a splash of soy milk , six more pieces of ice , another shot , soy milk , then she wants that blended . Then , on top of that , two pumps of raspberry , one pump of peppermint , one venti scoop of ice and a pump of our Frappuccino base , then blended again . Then sugar-free vanilla on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream , caramel drizzle , hazelnut drizzle , chocolate drizzle , mocha drizzle , and vanilla drizzle . That 's a high-maintenance drink . It came out chunky because our blender could n't really handle it , and we did n't even know how to ring her up . <p> Do you ever enforce the customer-only bathroom rule ? I believe it 's only been once when a homeless man came in and he locked himself inside for over an hour . He was washing himself in there . I let him finish , and we told him he had to leave . Then we had to clean that bathroom extensively . But I do n't mind people coming in just to use the bathroom . We have pretty clean bathrooms . Do what you got ta do . <p> How old is the food really ? All the food you see out was made that day . We freeze it when it comes in , but we would never put Wednesday food out on a Thursday . We throw away all the unused food at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so wasteful . One year , I got permission to donate all our unused pastries to a food pantry right around Thanksgiving , and I loved that . I should do that more often . <p> What food do people love most , and what should everyone avoid ? People love the cake pops and all the pumpkin stuff when it 's in season . And I pull about a dozen blueberry yogurt muffins every day , and we still sell out . Do n't eat the croissants . They 're just not up to the quality of Starbucks . A good croissant is n't in the refrigerator , and most of our customers know that . <p> What do you think of people who buy one coffee and sit there all day using Wi-Fi ? It does n't bother me . We have enough seats in there . If you do n't buy anything for a long time , we 'll go over and ask if you want water and get a feel for what you 're up to . But we wo n't kick you out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My favorite part of my job is the customers . I love seeing the light in their faces when they try a new drink and they love it . One customer was tired of her vanilla latte and wanted something different . I made her a black and white mocha , and she was so excited she told me I reinvented her palate . It 's those little things that outweigh the bad . <p> What 's the worst part of the job ? Probably cleaning . It 's just so much cleaning all day long . <p> What surprised you most about this interview ? Do you have any hilarious Starbucks experiences to share ? Let us know in the comments !

If it 's a group activity ( like paint balling ) , someone will suggest adding more people to your crew so that it 'll be cheaper for each person . If it 's somewhere where the price is set for each person ( like a movie ) , someone will want to know if there 's a cheaper option somewhere else .

The planner drops the ball . Sometimes , someone pitches some plans to the group chat and everyone is so down for the cause ... <p> Giphy.com <p> But then there 's no follow up . The group chat is left in the dark wondering , " What 's going on ? Is this happening ? " Sooner or later , the original person who got everyone hyped up for the group outing says they do n't feel like planning it , which is a major let-down. @qwx162444 <p> 8 .

Most polyps do n't require treatment " they go away on their own . Fibroids might require medication to shrink down .

But despite all the amazing perks , traveling so far away from home to go to school definitely has its downsides. @qwx162444 <p> 1 . The tuition hike . Why should you be punished just because your dream school was n't in the same state you were born in ? <p> 2 . Not knowing if you can make it home for Thanksgiving . A plane ( or train or bus ) ticket home might cost more than it 's worth to spend a couple of days with the fam , especially since a few weeks later , you 'll be coming home for over a month for winter break . <p> 4 .

If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you rarely need anything more than good ol ' denim jacket to keep warm even on the chilliest of nights , the idea of needing a heavy coat and array of accessories to brave the snowy , freezing winters in a state like Massachusetts or upstate New York seems so foreign . What do you even wear to combat the winter cold ? What is a winter coat , exactly ? <p> 5 . Figuring out what to do with all your stuff at the end of the school year . How are you supposed to move all your stuff from point to A to point B when you literally live on the opposite side of the country ? Do you rent a storage unit and put all your stuff there for the two-month break and just bring home the essentials ? Or do you rent a U-Haul and drive every single possession home even though it 's like a 10-hour drive ( not counting rest stop breaks ) and you 'll have to end up bringing most of it back in the fall . <p> 6 .

Sometimes for the worse ( in the case of your friend Casey who all the sudden made a million new friends and has no time for you ) and sometimes for the better ( like in the case of Jake , who grew a foot taller and suddenly is paying attention to you during your high school get-together ) . Sure , people change in college , no matter where they go to school , but when you are too far apart to see them often , it can feel really dramatic and jarring when you 've been away for several months , and you come home to a brand new person with little to no warning . <p> 8 .

And then you latch onto your roommate 's fam every time they visit . Your parents ca n't take off work just to hop on a flight across the country on the reg , so you end up being the parentless orphan at parents weekend . Your roommates fam totally takes pity on you and invites you to dinner with them and everything , but you ca n't help feeling like a bit of a stray puppy looking for a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , you just want your mom .

So your parents are constantly sending you care packages and and your friends are always texting you asking when your coming home so you can meet up . It 's awesome that your friends and fam love and miss you , but it can also be stressful . Finding time to FaceTime with mom and dad , text with all your friends from home and keep up with their lives on insta , while trying to make new friends and you know , study and go to class , is a lot to balance .

From how it 'll be the best time of your life to why living in dorms suck . But there are some things you wo n't hear from any upperclassmen , advisors , or recent grads . From textbook hacks to roommate realities , here are the top things no one tells you about your first year of college ! <p> You wo n't be sleeping until noon . <p> Number one thing college tour guides wo n't let you forget : You get to pick your own schedule ! And they never forget to mention how they picked their classes so they have no class on Wednesday and Friday . But what they often do forget to mention is that upperclassmen get first dibs on class times , and freshman are often left with the 8am death slot . <p> You might not click with your roommates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your roommates " after all , you will be living with them for a year and they may be the only people you know for a while . The truth is , sometimes you and your roommates wo n't click , but that 's okay . You can be a good roommate without being best friends . And it might work out better in the long run : You 'll be able to avoid the inevitable fights that comes along with sharing a tight space , because it 's easier to set boundaries when your roommate is n't your BFF . Plus , there will be plenty of opportunties to find your college crew through other outlets , like the countless clubs and events on campus . <p> Beware of the ride-moochers . <p> If you 're a freshman and are lucky enough to have a car , you 'll be amazed at how many people will want to be your friend . You 'll also be amazed by how many of those friends only text you when they need a ride . @qwx162444 <p> Skipping classes is not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most professors do n't take attendance , and you wo n't get in " trouble " if you do n't show up to the most boring lecture ever .

True , you can sometimes drop a class for certain reasons , but it can cost you : you 'll have to buy a new book ( new semester = new edition ) , pay for the class all over again , and lose a precious slot on your schedule next year that could have been used for a class you 'd actually enjoy . Moral of the story : Go to class . <p> Courtesy of the Company <p> The food can get old fast . <p> You 'll start out super excited about your unlimited food plan , but you 'll realize midway through the semester that the dining commons serve the same meals over and over , and you 'll get totally sick of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time . Luckily , there are some genius tricks for making the cafeteria food feel fresh . <p> Make sure you figure out what kind of party you 're hitting up before you splurge on a new outfit . Many college house parties are pretty casual , so if you show up dressed to the nines , you could look like a rookie . <p> But the boys are n't that different from high school . <p> Everyone tells you that all the cute upperclassmen are on the lookout for freshmen to flirt with , so you end up spending all night standing against the wall waiting for that cutie across the room to come over and live up to the hype .

Make an appointment as soon as you can and beat the rush of students that will be knocking on his or her door at the end of the semester . And remember : your advisor can be a great source of advice , but you 're the one who is ultimately responsible for your own academic success .

@@12931003 @1531003/ <h> 15 Ways to Make Your Breath Smell Good All the Time <p> Having amazing-smelling , kissable breath is easier than you think . Debra Glassman , D.D.S. and Jennifer Jablow , D.D.S. , both cosmetic dentists based in NYC , tell you how exactly how to get it . <p> 1 . Eat a healthy , balanced diet . Fatty foods break down and create ketones , a byproduct of fat that sits in your stomach and ferments ; the odor of ketones then come back up through your esophagus and can stick to your tongue . That 's why it 's important to add healthy carbs like broccoli , carrots , sweet potatoes , and fresh fruits into your diet , which balance out the fats and promote better breath . <p> 3 . Snack on more apples or any other crunchy , healthy foods . The hard texture of apples , celery , carrots , etc. , can remove food caught between your teeth and rub away bacteria that sit on them , creating that " sweater " feeling when you run your tongue over your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toothbrush . <p> 4 . Drink lots of water . H2O lubricates your mouth , keeping bacteria at bay , and also keeps your body functioning normally . Bottled sports drinks , sodas , and some bottled iced teas are preserved with citric acid , which not only contributes to bad breath but wears away the enamel on your teeth . Soda is even more acidic and can literally take paint off wall , so lower your intake of drinks of the sort and replace them will good , old water . <p> 5 . Drink more green juice and less coffee . Green juice contains low levels of acid , while coffee contains high amounts , which can lead to bad breath . And keeping your body at an alkaline level rather than an acidic level will make it function better overall . @qwx162444 <p> 6 . Chew on fresh mint leaves or parsley . If you want to naturally freshen your breath , stash one of these herbs in a sandwich bag and take them to go . The mint will help freshen your breath and up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jablow says , which works against the creation of volatile sulphur compounds , aka the rotten egg smell ( caused by hydrogen sulfide ) and the barnyard smell ( caused by methyl mercaptan ) . <p> 7 . Eat yogurt . Probiotics , which are in foods like yogurt , give you the proper enzymes you need to break down foods sufficiently and decrease the chance of food fermenting in your stomach . They help you get all the nutrients out of your food as well . <p> 8 . Brush and floss every single day . Sure , flossing is an extra step , but it 's an important one . Brushing your teeth helps eradicate the plaque and bacteria on your teeth , but flossing helps dislodge anything that your toothbrush could n't get to . If you do n't floss regularly , the food in between your teeth will feed the bacteria in your mouth , and the more nutrients you give the bacteria , the more the bacteria will give off stinky acids that cause bad breath . <p> 9 . Clean your tongue . Bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ byproduct that causes a gross stench . When you use a tongue scraper or brush your tongue , you remove any bacteria , byproducts from the bacteria , or plaque that form . <p> 10 . Rinse with alcohol-free mouthwash that contains a zinc compound . The goal is to always keep your mouth moist , because your saliva helps wash away odor- and cavity-causing bacteria . Avoid mouthwashes that contain alcohol , which dries your mouth out and leads to more bacteria and eventually bad breath . Dr. Glassman suggests opting for a mouthwash without alcohol , or even creating your own at home using 1 tablespoon baking soda poured into 1 cup warm water with a few drops of essential peppermint oil . " The baking soda is antibacterial , there is n't any alcohol it in , and it can help freshen your breath in a pinch if you run out of mouthwash , " she says . @qwx162444 <p> " It 's also important to pick up an alcohol-free mouthwash with a zinc compound in it , since zinc kills the volatile sulphur compounds , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product line Intelliwhite IntelliFresh Oral Rinse Fusion , which also contains peroxide that kills the bacteria that sits under the gum line . <p> 11 . Chew sugarless gum that contains xylitol . Chewing gum increases salivary flow and helps remove some bacteria and staining , but you want to make it 's sugar-free so you 're not feeding the bacteria in your mouth and contributing to bad breath . Opt for a brand that contains the sweetener xylitol , which is antibacterial . It helps fight cavities and bacteria while improving the health of your teeth and gums . Try SuperSmile Whitening Gum With Xylitol . <p> 12 . Pop a breath gel in your purse . If you have temporomandibular joint and muscle disorders ( TMJ ) and ca n't chew gum , use an on-the-go breath gel with xylitol to freshen you breath in a snap .

You can also opt for mints that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xylitol Mints . <p> 13 . Steer clear of cigarettes . You already know all the reasons cigarettes are super , super bad for you , but here 's another reason never to smoke : Smoking not only dries out your mouth and body tissues , the nicotine actually squeezes the blood vessels so you 're not getting healthy saliva flow . This combo is what disrupts your mouth 's normal functioning process and leads to bad breath . To avoid this from happening , stop smoking or never start . Ever . @qwx162444 <p> 14 . Apply flavored lipgloss . This is n't going to turn your garlic breath into the most amazing-smelling breath ever , but it will help mask the odor until you get the chance to brush and floss your teeth . <p> 15 . Visit your dentist regularly . Especially if your bad breath is n't going away and you 've tried all of the above , since you could be dealing with something more serious .

@@12931006 @1531006/ <p> Ever had the urge to re-watch every Disney Channel original series from start to finish , but there just is n't enough time in the world to do it ? After all , they 've been airing since 1995 . Well , we 've ranked them all ( ok , only the live-action ones ! ) in order of priority . From the ones you can totally skip ( or save for when you 're super bored over winter break ) to the shows you absolutely must , must , must relive as your next TV binge , here 's the definitive ranking of Disney Channel live-action series . @qwx162444 <h> 29 . So Random ! ( 2011-2012 ) <p> It was a bummer when Sonny with a Chance was canceled , but the bright side was Sonny 's show-within-a-show So Random ! was picked up as a spinoff series . You so wanted to love it , but it just did n't have the personality and charm that Sonny did , which is prob why it got tragically canceled after one season . *tear* <h> 28 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney Channel is known for kids ' programming , this show about a dog who talks and blogs about life , while cute and funny , seemed a little too juvenile when you were younger . So you 'll probably want to save this one for when you 're babysitting . <h> 27 . Jonas ( 2009-2010 ) @qwx162447 <p> As much as you loved being able to watch The Jonas Brothers on your screen every week , their Disney Channel show , Jonas , was a bit of a mess . It took a whole season of goofy , slapstick high school shenanigans before it finally found its footing as a more serious show about the ups and downs of being in a famous boy band in its second season . But by then , it was too late and the show was canceledafter two seasons . It 's worth watching if you 're a major Jonas Brothers fan , but based on its Disney Channel chops alone , this one is , sadly , skippable. @qwx162444 <h> 26 . I Did n't Do It ( 2014-2015 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twins ' never-ending struggle to get out of trouble with the various grownups in their lives , the show is told in constant flashbacks , which can get pretty annoying after a while . <h> 25 . Best Friends Whenever ( 2015 - Present ) <p> Time traveling besties going back in time to fix their biggest mistakes whose plans never work out according to plan ? Sign us up ! It 's a hilarious show with pretty epic special effects , but it 's only been on the air for a blink of an eye compared to the Disney Channel 's other epic shows , so it should n't take it personally for ending up so low on the list . It still has time to work its way up . <h> 24 . BUNK 'D ( 2015-Present ) @qwx162447 @qwx162444 <p> BUNK 'd follows Emma , Ravi , and Zuri Ross from Jessie from their comfy penthouse in New York City to Camp Kikiwaka , the summer camp in Maine where their parents met when they were younger . The show is funny and cute enough , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lap of luxury try and adjust to life in the great outdoors . But frankly , like Best Friends Whenever , it 's only been on the air for a few months and ca n't hold a candle to all the amazing Disney Channel classics just yet . <h> 23 . A.N.T . Farm ( 2011-2014 ) <p> This Glee-like show about three best friends attending a school for super-talented kids was beyond fun to watch when you were younger and China Anne McClain continuously blew you away with her amazing vocals . But unlike some of the other Disney Channel shows , it never felt all that relatable tbh . Still , it 's always fun to catch an episode everyone once and a while for some serious nostalgia . <h> 22 . Cory in the House ( 2007-2008 ) <p> Even though That 's So Raven fans were thrilled to see more of Raven 's hilarious and mischievous little brother Cory Baxter after the series ended and his high-profile White House antics always kept you glued to the screen , Cory in the House just did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 21 . Shake It Up ( 2010-2013 ) <p> Shake It Up was your standard Disney Channel show about regular girls getting their big break in the entertainment industry and all the ups and downs that come with being famous , only it was about two besties becoming backup dancers on one of their local dance shows . Kind of like Hairspray meets Hannah Montana . The show was all types of awesome , partly because the dance routines in every episode were on-point , but mostly because it gave us the epic on-screen and IRL besties Zendaya and Bella Thorne ! @qwx162444 <h> 20 . Flash Forward ( 1995-1997 ) @qwx162447 <p> Flash Forward was Disney Channel 's very first television show and it followed next-door neighbors and best friends Tucker and Becca through the ups and downs of middle school . Watching it today , you 'd never believe it aired on the Disney Channel . From its realistic sets ( which have all but disappeared on the network 's shows ) to its totally basic main character Becca literally being you in middle school , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come by these days . *tear* That 's why every true DC fan absolutely must rewatch this gem of a show , but others might find it a little too ... well , basic for their tastes . @qwx162444 <h> 19 . Sonny with a Chance ( 2009-2011 ) @qwx162447 <p> Sonny With a Chance was so amazing because you could totally put yourself in Sonny 's shoes and relate to her wide-eyed excitement over getting to star on her favorite TV show . It would be like you getting the chance to go back in time and star in Hannah Montana or Lizzie McGuire ! Not to mention , you got to hear Demi Lovato 's amazing vocals bless your ears every now and again as Sonny . Sadly , the beloved series came to an early end after only two seasons . *tear* <h> 18 . In a Heartbeat ( 2000-2001 ) <p> This Disney Channel original gets major points for portraying teenagers in a high-stakes job that is n't being a secret celebrity . Nope , In a Heartbeat follows a group of teens who work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their normal lives while dealing with the pressures and emotions that come with being EMTs . If you 're looking for some old-school Disney Channel nostalgia but want a break from the overused **27;483;TOOLONG kids ' show storyline , this is the perf show to rewatch. @qwx162444 <h> 17 . Liv and Maddie ( 2013-Present ) @qwx162447 <p> Twins Liv and Maddie Rooney are complete opposites , and they 're portrayed by Dove Cameron and ... Dove Cameron . Yup , though Disney Channel totes could have gone out and found a set of twins to play Liv and Maddie , Dove plays both of them and still manages to give them both super unique , hilarious personalities of their own . This show gets MAJOR points for that alone ! But Liv &amp; Maddie also shows that even though you and your sibs may not have much in common , you 'll still always have each other 's backs , which anyone with a sibling can relate to no matter how old you get . @qwx162444 <h> 16 . Jessie ( 2011-2015 ) <p> Even though everyone was super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after three seasons , fans were super psyched to see Debby Ryan return to their screens as a hilarious wannabe actress nannying for the Ross family in NYC while she tries to get her big break . And the fact that it was the first show to portray siblings who were adopted only made it even more AWESOME ! Rewatching Jessie is such a blast because it makes you feel like maybe just maybe babysitting your annoying next door neighbor is just a stepping stone to becoming the world 's next biggest superstar . <h> 15 . Austin &amp; Ally ( 2011-2015 ) @qwx162447 <p> Who would n't love a show about two musicians who are completely opposite " super confident Austin and beyond shy Ally " skyrocketing to fame after he records a music video for a song she wrote and it goes viral , and of course , they fall in love along the way ? It falls right in the middle of the pack , because while it 's standard Disney fare , with its regular girl/boy becomes a superstar overnight concept , Ross Lynch and Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices , that you ca n't help but fall for this one , no matter how many times you 've seen it . Seriously , you 'd have to be heartless not to love this show ( and rewatch it shamelessly over and over again ) ! @qwx162444 <h> 15 . Phil of the Future ( 2004-2006 ) <p> Just imagine how painfully hard it would be to go back and try to fit in during the ' 90s , before cell phones and laptops and Instagram ! Now you know how Disney Channel 's original time traveler , Phil Diffy felt trying to act like he belonged in 2004 , when he was actually from the super-advanced year of 2121 . Can you even imagine not going crazy in such conditions ? You 'll totally relate now to Phil 's futuristic struggle every time you parents make fun of your text-speak or your selfie addiction . <h> 14 . Girl Meets World ( 2014-Present ) @qwx162447 @qwx162444 <p> Girl Meets World follows the ups and down of Riley Matthew 's teenaged life . She just happens to be daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AKA ' 90s TV 's #1 couple . The show is almost too real as it deals with struggles that every teen girl goes through on a daily basis , from crushes and bullying to learning about autism . The show definitely does its namesake justice and also gives fans of the original series a peak into what the original characters are up to 15 years later for the best of both worlds . *nostalgia* <h> 13 . Good Luck Charlie ( 2010-2014 ) <p> Every older sister feels the need to give their little sibs the best chance of surviving their crazy family by imparting every bit of older-sister wisdom they have to them . That 's why Good Luck Charlie is so relatable . Teddy Duncan 's vlogs to her newborn sister as she goes through her own teenaged ups and downs resonated with you on a spiritual level . Whenever your family is driving you absolutely nuts , you can count on a rerun of Good Luck Charlie to remind you you can totally get through life in one piece . <h> 12 . The Jersey ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preteen 's fave show about four teenagers who discover a sports jersey that magically transports them into famous sports stars ' bodies during high-stakes games . It literally made YOU feel like an all-star player during every episode while simultaneously teaching important lessons about confidence and friendship.It also had an unbelievable list of amazing special guest sports stars , like Peyton Manning and Laila Ali , that made the series feel even more real . This show deserves a rewatch , because it 's one of the only Disney Channel shows that revolves around sports and how they can be a powerful outlet for young boys AND girls to learn and grow . <h> 10 . K.C. Undercover ( 2015-Present ) @qwx162447 @qwx162444 <p> It may be a more recent addition to the network , but K.C. Undercover is the most girl-poweriest show there is when it comes to Disney kids ' programming . And with the incredible Zendaya in the lead as K.C. , how could it not be ? K.C. is a secret spy kicking major villainous butt with her spy family , and it 's just nonstop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do anything . Even though it just started this year , rewatching these episodes never gets old because they 're so action-packed , relatable , and HILARIOUS . Plus , Zendaya . Need we say more ? <h> 9 . The Famous Jett Jackson ( 1998-2001 ) @qwx162447 <p> This gem of a Disney Channel show about a young superstar named Jett who moves his hit television show to North Carolina so he can have a semi-normal life was the original Hannah Montana . It had a crazy list of iconic special guest stars , like Britney Spears and Destiny 's Child , and taught an important life lesson in every episode . Even though its star , Lee Thompson Young , committed suicide tragically in 2013 after struggling with bipolar disorder , this Disney Channel show is an amazing , uplifting legacy he left behind . @qwx162444 <h> 8 . So Weird ( 1999-2001 ) @qwx162447 <p> Unlike most Disney Channel shows , So Weird was dark , creepy , and twisted . It was basically the X-Files for kids and followed Fi Phillips as she traveled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paranormal activity on the road . It 's a pity Disney Channel got squeamish about how scary the series was and decided to replace the main character Fi to revamp it as a lighter show in its third season . While everyone loved the new lead , Alexz Johnson as Annie Thelen , the show lost part of its allure when it did away with its dark tone . Even so , this series is endlessly rewatchable because it delves into more mature issues other Disney Channel shows do n't , like death and loss , and honestly , is still pretty scary . @qwx162444 <h> 7 . The Suite Life on Deck ( 2008-2011 ) <p> This is probably the one and only Disney Channel spinoff that lived up to the original series , probably because it used the same exact formula as the original , just set on a cruise ship instead of in a hotel . See #6 to see all the reasons why this is a must re-watch. <h> 6 . The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody ( 2005-2008 ) @qwx162447 <p> The Suite Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to count . Not only did it give you two cute twins for your tween self to crush on , but they were also living the dream life . As siblings who get to spend their days at the lavish Tipton Hotel because their mom is the lounge singer , you could n't help but tune in every week to catch the Martin twins ( played by Disney Channel royalty Dylan and Cole Sprouse ) wreak havoc on the hotel with the help of their misfit family members who also live there . The show was so good , it got a spinoff where the twins got up to more mischief as always , only on a ship . See #7. @qwx162444 <h> 5 . Hannah Montana ( 2006-2011 ) <p> Of course Hannah Montana is rounding out the top five . The show about a teen living a double life as a regular girl by day and a superstar by night was so popular , it kicked off a ton of other Disney shows about regular girls becoming celebs . This show resonated so much with Disney Channel fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a superstar , but also because 13-year-old Miley Cyrus was the charismatic actress that could pull off playing a totally regular girl in one breath AND a high-fashion pop star in the next . <h> 4 . Wizards of Waverly Place ( 2007-2012 ) <p> Who knew how relatable and amazing a show about a family of wizards could be ? ! Even though Wizards is about three magical siblings who will one day have to battle it out to keep their powers , the amazing cast and its focus on family values is what made it one of the Disney Channel 's best and longest-running shows , with a whopping 106 episodes ! It also happened to be Selena Gomez 's breakout role as the hilarious Alex Russo , giving you a glimpse into where all that amazing Selena sass originated . <h> 3 . Even Stevens ( 2000-2003 ) @qwx162447 @qwx162444 <p> This show was about the misadventures of the Stevens family " mainly the shenanigans of the youngest brother Louis , who was played by the super talented Shia LaBeouf before he turned into a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a classic because it featured a character everyone could relate to , from the little brother who could n't do anything right and looked up to his older sports-star brother to the middle sister who always felt out of place . In the end , they all had each other 's backs though , and that 's what family is all about ! It was Disney Channel 's first real original HIT and it really kicked off the golden age of the Disney Channel . It 's basically American history and therefore , a must rewatch. <h> 2 . Lizzie McGuire ( 2001-2004 ) @qwx162447 @qwx162444 <p> Lizzie McGuire was every girl living a normal life and feeling like the world was against you and not having anyone understand how amazing you totally ARE ( except your small group of besties of course , which Lizzie had in her amazing friends Miranda and Gordo ) . Lizzie was the first Disney Channel show to get its own movie and thank goodness for that , since it surely paved the way for other Disney Channel originals like Hannah Montana and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilary Duff walked right into every teen girl 's heart with her relatable portrayal of a normal girl with normal problems , but still managed to make every experience seem extraordinary ( which is totes how you felt growing up ) . You can never get sick of rewatching this classic because it touches on basically every high school experience , from your first breakup ( darn that mail boy that broke Lizzie 's heart ! ) to being a total fangirl 100% of the time ( *goes to rewatch classic Aaron Carter episode* ) . <h> 1 . That 's So Raven ( 2003-2007 ) @qwx162447 <p> Coming in at number one is That 's So Raven because it combined the best parts of every one of the Disney Channel 's best shows . It had the relatable aspect with Raven being a regular girl dealing with her crazy family ( especially her annoying little brother ) , her crushes , and all the typical high school woes . But the show also had a touch of the supernatural , as Raven could see the future , which obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known for , like that time Raven saw herself kissing Chelsea 's crush in a vision and had to do everything possible to stay away from him , or when Raven dressed up as her mother ( #iconic ) to avoid her actual parents finding out that she mouthed off in class so she could keep her new phone . It had musical and dance episodes on top of special epsthat delved into serious issues like body-shaming and racism . Raven Symone is a household name to this day thanks to this iconic Disney Channel original , and watching her in the beloved role is just as amazing now as it was when you were a kid .

Here 's how to deal going into spring semester . <p> Lauren Keech <p> By Michelle Ruiz <p> Aug 4 , 2016 <p> " Any college women who battled the freshman blues &amp; might be willing to talk to me about it for a story ? " I tweeted earlier this semester . Within minutes , I heard from Danielle ( not her real name ) , an 18-year-old freshman at a university in Massachusetts .

After her very first college class , " I was so overwhelmed that I had to hide in a bathroom stall for a good 45 minutes before I could come out .

I cried because I ca n't figure out why it is so easy for me to make friends in my hometown but not at my new school . " <p> Erin Mitchell <p> Lauren Keech @qwx162444 <p> You 'd never know it from the shiny , happy , super-fun depiction of college in movies and TV shows , but beneath the flying Frisbees , frat parties , and funny a cappella concerts on the quad , many college freshmen are struggling . While colleges ' handling of campus sexual assault remains an ongoing battle , mental health issues are also gripping college students , especially freshman , from cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " freshman blues " " to more serious battles . <p> Last year UCLA 's Higher Education Research Institute ( which has studied the lives of incoming college students every year for the last 50 years in its American Freshman report ) found that the 150,000 freshmen they surveyed rated their emotional health as lower than any class since 1985 . When asked to rate their emotional health compared to their peers , only about 51-percent said theirs was " in the highest 10 percent " of people or even " above average . " Freshman also said that they felt overwhelmed and felt depressed in the past year more frequently than classes of years past , and that they were spending less time socializing with friends and more time focused on academics . @qwx162444 <p> With the pressure surrounding college admissions reaching new heights , " It seemed as though students were really buckling down in their senior year to make sure that they got into college , " noted study author Kevin Eagan , an assistant professor and managing director of the Higher Education Research Institute . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressed out . They were pretty anxious . Many of them were feeling more depressed .

Anxiety and depression are often linked , experts say , as dealing with long-term anxiety can lead to depression , or one may feel anxious about their battle with depression .

Without family in the mix , you might feel more free to either binge or not eat enough , quit exercising or exercise far too much . Being thrust into college , among hundreds or thousands of other 17- and 18-year-olds , can also force you to consider complicated questions about your family background , your economic upbringing , race , ethnicity , and sexual or gender identity ( this can be particularly overwhelming for first-generation or low-income freshman ) . <p> " It 's not as if as there 's this light switch and we 're suddenly ready for the whole adult world , " says Gregory Eells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornell University , which has been hailed one of the best universities in the country in providing mental health services to its students .

" In reality , Commerford says , " the connections you grab who might live next door to you might not be kindred spirits . Building new friendships is a process during your first year . It can take a while to meet people that you have a lot in common with . " @qwx162444 <p> In some cases , the shaky , early days of freshman year and a case of the normal , expected " freshman blues " can escalate into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , now " around winter break and beyond . ( If that happens , experts advise seeking help from your college mental health center " more on that later . ) With the stress of new adulthood and living on your own , the late teens and early 20s are a time when mental illnesses can manifest for the first time , whether someone is in college or not , says Eells , especially if someone is already genetically predisposed . About half of the people seeking counseling services at Cornell have already experienced mental health issues before arriving at college . <p> " I struggled intensely with depression my whole life , and , even though I expected the opposite , it only intensified when I when I went away to college , " said Erin Mitchell , a 20-year-old junior at Penn State in Pennsylvania . " My freshman year of college was probably both the best and worst year of my life . " <p> During a tough childhood that included mental illness in her family , Mitchell idealized college , expecting it to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't really have many of in high school ) , and even , possibly , love . But " being thrust into all these new social situations triggered my anxiety in the worst possible way , " she recalled . @qwx162444 <p> As Mitchell discovered her high expectations of freshman year were naive , her depression raged on . " I let myself get sucked into unwanted friends-with-benefits situations with super gross boys , " she said . " I 'd feel like crap about myself because of this person except for the , like , one hour every weekend night when I got bootycalled . " <p> Burdened by depression and anxiety , Mitchell mostly ignored academics her first year " so much so that her GPA is still recovering two years later . Academic-related anxiety and depression is a common theme among freshmen who seek counseling , says Eells , whether because college academics are much more difficult than those at some high schools , or because students who long identified as the smartest kid in their old school are suddenly one of many . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are than other people Cornell , for one , is a terrible place to be , because there 's tons of people smarter than you , " Eells says . <p> It 's also easy to lie in your extra-long twin bed refreshing Instagram instead of going to the awkward ice cream social in your dorm and " friending " people IRL . But being glued to your phone makes it that much harder to put yourself out there , meet new people , and find the same kind of support at college that you might have had at home . The UCLA American Freshman report found that current incoming college students are socializing with friends less than ever before : In 1987 , 38-percent socialized at least 16 hours per week with friends ; by 2014 , that number dropped to 18-percent . <p> " The first week of school , we all stayed in our rooms with our door shut , " remembers Sara , who is naturally shy . " The first couple of weeks , I was like , ' I feel like I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the last decade , " we are starting to see some of the influence of social media , " says UCLA 's Eagan . " Students might text their roommate rather than turn around from the computer and have a conversation with their roommate . It 's part of a new reality . " <p> Mid-way through her first semester , Sara was tired and bored of sitting in her room and hearing the roar of the nearby football games she was too shy to attend , so she took matters into her own hands . She joined a sorority , something she never thought she 'd do . She started grabbing coffees with her " sisters " and feeling less alone . " When I came back in the spring , I knew what to expect , " she said . " I had gotten to know some of my sorority sisters better , and then I realized that I missed them over Christmas break . " <p> Looking back , Sara sees her rough first semester of freshman year as a case of the " freshman blues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rather than an anxiety disorder or depression . An important distinction is that she was able to function in her everyday life : sleep , get out of bed , attend class , and , as awkward as it was at times , venture to the dining hall with some girls from her hall . But when feelings of anxiety , or depression , or both , make you feel unable to sleep or get out of bed , eat , attend class , or socialize , " that 's when you know it 's time to seek help , " Eells says . " If it 's more than the initial homesickness , the best advice is to seek care . " <p> Visit your school 's mental health center ( most colleges have them ) for a consultation and let a counselor know what you 're going through " you may need more counseling or , in some cases , medication . Of course , you do n't need to wait until your symptoms get to the point where you ca n't get out of bed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling with anxiety or depression , try to go as soon as you are able . If you had issues with anxiety or depression in high school " even if you 're doing better when you come to college " experts suggest making a plan for maintaining your care at school , just in case you have a flare-up . @qwx162444 <p> " I 've seen students who have a history of anxiety or depression say , ' Oh , I 'll be at college and everything will be fine . This is n't my past . ' I 've seen that be a dangerous strategy , " says Eells . Making a connection at the mental health center or scheduling a periodic check-in is a proactive way to take care of yourself in your brand new world . Though the stigma of seeing a therapist is slowly falling away , freshmen women who are struggling should remember that they 're hardly alone , and that there 's no shame in reaching out to get assistance . As Commerford says , " seeking help is an act of courage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need help sometimes . " <p> Seeing a counselor at Penn State 's mental health center and eventually starting to take antidepressants helped Erin through her freshman year " from hell . " " I was worried that going to counseling would validate my fear that I was ' crazy , ' but it actually made me feel 90-percent less crazy , " she said . In addition , she cited getting a gym membership as helping her feel more physically and mentally healthy . " A key piece when you 're having a tough time ( and even when you 're not ) is self-care , " noted Commerford . " Are you taking good care of yourself ? Are you getting enough sleep ? Eating regularly ? Without sleep and food , even the hardiest person begins to have symptoms . Do you do things regularly to relax , get your mind off things , have fun ? Do you talk about your life and feelings with friends , family , and get that support ? " <p> Erin also found solace in a new support network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshman year . Though she was vigilantly anti-Greek before coming to college , she decided to try rush on a whim , and came to realize that not all sorority girls fit the stereotype she 'd perceived as catty . " My sorority was my greatest resource for friendship and really saved my life , " Erin says . Realizing that her FWB relationships were triggering her depression , she wrote off casual hookups with guys who did n't treat her to her standards . " I still deal with depression and anxiety . I think that 's a permanent part of my life , " she says , " but the good thing is that , through a lot of trial and error , I 've figured out how to deal with it , and it does n't control me. " @qwx162444 <p> Erin Mitchell , with her sorority sisters <p> Sarah Northey <p> " I experienced the lowest of lows in college , but sticking it out and making active choices to try to get better from it and return from failing grades and crippling depression instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Erin adds . <p> A month after our first emails , Danielle is doing better at her Massachusetts college . She has n't yet sought counseling , only because her symptoms are slowly subsiding : During one of the late nights when she could n't sleep , she realized she was n't the only one on her floor with lights peeking out under the door . A group of people on her floor stayed up late talking and hanging out . She still does n't like to party , but she 's met a few people on her floor that do n't , either , or she keeps her door open for late-night hangouts with those who do go out . <p> Things still are n't perfect , but they 're a lot better . She 's even thinking about becoming a resident advisor next year to help new freshmen through their own tough times : " It 's really amazing how far I 've come since that day in the bathroom stall .

In the books , we 'd gotten to see Ginny and her relationship with Harry grow , whereas in the movies , Ginny never really got much screen time ( which is totes not okay ) , and it was like , BAM : @qwx162444 <p> But the heartwrenchingly amazing way they brought Albus Dumbledore 's death to the big screen made this movie so hard to put this low on the list . It was such an important part of the story , and the movie definitely did n't disappoint ( other than , you know , Dumbledore having to die ) . <p> 5 . Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix ( 2007 ) <p> Order of the Phoenix was the fifth book , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect sense that it 's number five on our list , too . It was the first movie to feel really dark .

And these challenging topics came at the perfect time because Daniel , Rupert , and Emma 's acting was better than ever in this movie ! Then there was the angst that comes with growing up that Harry totes understood . <p> We feel you Harry . We really do . <p> 4 . Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ( 2005 ) <p> We 're getting to the best of the best ! Goblet of Fire takes the fourth spot simply because it 's gloriously adventure-packed awkward !

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows : Part 1 &amp; 2 ( 2010-2011 ) <p> First of all , Deathly Hollows gets a million points for the genius idea to split the book into two movies , not only because we got more Harry Potter films , but because it inspired other movie adaptations to expand their final chapter into two ( like TheHunger Games ) ! The two Deathly Hollows movies come in nearly at the top of the list , and it 's because they gave us our happy ending . We got to see our faves defeat Lord Voldemort after seven long years ( and an EPIC final battle scene ! ) , and then we got to see them married with kids , which brought the tears . For real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azkaban ( 2004 ) <p> There was no other choice . Prisoner of Azkaban is , no doubt , the most amazing Harry Potter film there is .

It was colorful , and quirky , and it introduced us to epic characters , like Sirius Black , and showed us new sides to old characters , like the Whomping Willow *wink wink* ! Most importantly , in Prisoner of Azkaban , Daniel , Rupert , and Emma were more comfortable than ever acting with one another , which made our fave magical trio 's friendship even stronger and more relatable on screen . <p> What do you think of our ranking ?

She worried about fitting in , making her volleyball team , and acing her classes . Come senior year , I had bigger worries . What seemed to be so important back as a freshman was nothing compared to what I considered important as a senior . I began thinking about how to survive out in the real world in college .

I was actually in South Carolina on vacation at the time , but I forced my dad to abandon the fam and take me to the movies because nothing was going to stop me from seeing it ASAP . Yes , I was that obsessed with Lizzie McGuire . I remember the film being epic , amazing , and Oscar-worthy . I got it on DVD the second it came out and watched it at least 35 times in the month that followed . @qwx162444 <p> But now I 'm 24 . Will The Lizzie McGuire Movie live up to my memories of it ? Was Paolo as studdly as I remember ? Is Hilary 's Italian accent actually convincing ? Will Lizzie 's performance of " This is What Dream Are Made Of " still make me cry with joy ? I re-watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 1 . Lizzie 's parents freaking out about her trip to Rome is so your parents . Her mom rambled on about how worried she is and kept saying the same thing over and over . Her dad jumped in with that totally irrelevant Shakespeare quote . You could just replace her parents with yours and no one would notice . <p> DISNEY <p> 2 . Kate noticing Lizzie was wearing the same dress she wore to the spring dance under her graduation robe is next-level weird . Why is she so obsessed with Lizzie ? @qwx162444 <p> DISNEY <p> 3 . LOL at Mr. Escobar asking Lizzie to deliver the commencement speech 20 seconds before graduation . I get that the president and vice president were n't there for some reason , but it seems fake for that responsibility to fall on the treasurer . Like is a speech THAT important at a junior high graduation ? Was the valedictorian not available ? And do n't speeches have to be approved anyway ? <p> DISNEY @qwx162444 <p> 4 . Imagine Lizzie had her graduation #FAIL in 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would have gotten uploaded to YouTube and went insanely viral all over the world . Lizzie had it easy . It could have been way worse . <p> DISNEY <p> 5 . Miss Ungermeyer TOTALLY would have gotten fired for that speech . Did she seriously just call kids " trailer trash " and suggest they were all going to end up folding clothes at the Outlook Mall ? <p> DISNEY @qwx162444 <p> 6 . Lizzie and Gordo 's plane ride shenanigans , though ? So obviously meant to be together . And when he took her up to the roof of the hotel ! SWOON . <p> DISNEY <p> 7 . And who knew Gordo had game ? " I 'm in Rome with my best friend , I 'm good , " he says when Lizzie tells him to make a wish in the fountain . TOTAL BOYFRIEND MATERIAL . Why did it take so long for Lizzie to see it ? ' <p> DISNEY @qwx162444 <p> 8 . Lizzie 's description of Isabella and Paolo 's music is too accurate .

" But for driving around in the car with the top down , putting on your lip gloss , loving life kind of thing ? They 're good . " Description on point . <p> DISNEY <p> 9 . Lizzie has apparently never heard of stranger danger . She just jumped onto a moped with Paolo , no questions asked ? I do n't care how famous or cute he is . <p> DISNEY @qwx162444 <p> 10 . Paolo unloaded Isabella 's dirty secrets on Lizzie WAAAAAY too quickly . She should have known he was no good . <p> DISNEY <p> 11 . I knew Ethan was good at something .

Also , should n't Paolo have realized Lizzie can actually sing and abandon his whole stupid plan anyway ? <p> Disney @qwx162444 <p> 19 . Enough with the crocodile tears , Lizzie . You were n't missing Gordo when you were ditching him to sing and dance with Paolo ! <p> Disney <p> 20 . But at least she admitted she was being selfish in the next scene . I guess I can forgive her . <p> Disney @qwx162444 <p> 21 . Why did n't Miss Ungermeyer care that Ethan was hanging out in Lizzie 's hotel room ? Pretty sure there were no boys allowed in my hotel room on my sophomore United Nations trip to NYC . <p> Disney <p> 22 . SURPRISE ! Gordo was right the whole time . I ate this stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 23 . The plot might be unbelievable , but watching that scumbag Paolo get embarrassed in front of the entire country is still beyond satisfying . <p> Disney <p> 24 .

Your mind might immediately jump to pregnancy ( if you 're sexually active ) or a serious medical condition ( if you 're not ) . But there are actually a bunch of different reasons why your period might be out of whack . We talked to Jennifer Ashton , M.D. , a New Jersey-based gynecologist and the author of The Body Scoop for Girls : A Straight-Talk Guide to a Healthy , Beautiful You , about the different factors that can cause your period to get off track and when you should be concerned . @qwx162444 <p> Here are 10 possible reasons you 're not getting your period on the regular . <p> 1 . You started menstruating within the past two years . <p> Puberty is a gradual process .

Ashton calls your first cycles " training wheels " for the next couple of decades . " If the period is irregular in the first two years , we usually do n't get worked up over it because it 's so common , " she says . <p> Most girls get their periods between the ages of 8 and 16 , although getting it earlier or later than that is n't necessarily cause for concern . Not every irregular period is an urgent problem . The younger you are , and the more recently you 've begun menstruating , the less likely there 's any cause for concern " your body just takes a while to get used to its new habits . But regardless of what your period is like , Ashton recommends visiting a gynecologist for your first appointment between the ages of 13 and 15 . You wo n't necessarily need a physical exam , and it 's a great opportunity for you to ask your doctor any questions you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're tracking it wrong ( or you 're not tracking it at all ) . <p> If your menstrual cycle is healthy , the first day of one period and the first day of the next period should be between 21 and 40 days . <p> If you do n't track your period , there 's a chance you might not even notice you 're irregular . It 's tough remembering exactly when you got your last period ( was it the day of your chem quiz ? or did it start the day of your history quiz ? ) , so if you do n't use a period tracker app on your phone already , download one now to best stay on top of your health . Period Tracker Lite is free on iOS and Android , and it 's easy and discreet to use . @qwx162444 <p> 3 . You 're underweight . <p> While there 's no minimum weight or body mass index ( BMI ) required to menstruate , you do need a certain percentage of body fat in order to have regular periods . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standpoint , " Ashton explains . " If a girl is underweight , her brain thinks she 's in a situation of famine , so it 's not the best time to reproduce . " <p> You might have heard that highly athletic girls with low body fat sometimes lose their periods . While this is biologically possible , most girls who are on their school 's sports teams or working out at the gym wo n't experience this unless they 're doing something extreme , like training for a marathon or triathalon . <p> If you suffer from an eating disorder or are concerned that your weight may be interfering with your cycle , talk to your doctor . <p> 4 . You have polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) . <p> PCOS is a disorder that causes your body to make the right types of hormones , but in the wrong ratios . Doctors are n't sure if it 's caused by genetics or if there 's a specific trigger , but girls with PCOS often have periods that are very spaced out " six to eight weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a year after their first cycle , because their hormone imbalance causes overactivity in the ovaries . Other symptoms of PCOS include weight gain , oily skin or acne , depression or mood swings , and hair loss or hair growth . If you happen to have any of these symptoms , you do n't necessarily have PCOS , but if you experience a few or more and are concerned you might have it , talk to your doctor . @qwx162444 <p> 5 . You just started taking a form of hormonal birth control . <p> The Pill , the patch , the NuvaRing , the Depo-Provera injection , and most types of the IUD are all forms of hormonal birth control , which changes the levels of estrogen and progestin in your body that affect your period . It can take awhile for your body to adjust , especially if your cycle was irregular to begin with . <p> In addition to lowering your risk of pregnancy , hormonal birth control is often prescribed to girls with really irregular periods to help make their cycles more predictable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take some trial and error to figure out which form of hormonal birth control works best from you . <p> " Most birth control pills ( if not all ) will ' regulate ' a period in time . It 's just a matter of finding the right pill that works for that particular girl , " Ashton says . Non-hormonal forms of birth control like condoms , by the way , do not involve hormones and therefore , wo n't affect your period . <p> By the way , hormonal birth control does not completely eliminate your risk of pregnancy . Even with proper use , it still has an eight percent failure rate per year , according to Ashton . To reduce your risk of pregnancy further , you can use a condom in addition to taking the Pill . <p> 6 . You 're not taking the Pill properly . <p> Birth control pills come in two types : monophasic , where every pill in the pack is the same , and triphasic , which has a variety of active pills ( containing different types and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't include hormones ) . If you take triphasic birth control , you bleed during the week you take the placebo pills . But if you skip the placebo pills , you wo n't bleed . @qwx162444 <p> It 's also important to take the Pill at the same time every day , without missing a day . " If girls miss pills or skip days or take it at widely variable times during the day , that can cause irregular bleeding , " Ashton says . It can also make the Pill less effective . <p> Need clarification on how to take the Pill properly ? Talk to your doctor . Remember , there are several different types and brands of the Pill , so you need to be sure you 're taking it as directed . <p> 7 . Your cycle is syncing up with another girl 's . <p> If you live with other girls and women who menstruate , like your mom , a sister , or a roommate , there 's a good chance you 'll eventually wind up on the same cycle , Ashton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's incredibly common " and it explains why you might get your period on a day you did n't expect . <p> 8 . You 're taking certain medication . <p> If you 're taking meds for depression , anxiety , bipolar disorder , or another psychiatric disorder , they could potentially disrupt your cycle . " The more medications you 're on , the more potential there is for irregular bleeding , " Ashton says . <p> This does n't mean you should go off your meds without consulting your doctor . Ask your doctor about your options " you might be a good candidate for hormonal birth control , like the Pill or an IUD . <p> 9 . You 're experiencing vaginal bleeding , but not because of your period . <p> Not every instance of vaginal bleeding is a result of your period . In extremely rare cases , you might bleed due to an infection , a tumor , a bleeding or clotting disorder ( such as Von Willebrand Deficiency ) , or a foreign object inserted into your vagina . One way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for another reason is to track your cycle , but if you have concerns , speak with your doctor . <p> 10 . You 're pregnant . <p> Missing your period is one of the earliest signs of pregnancy . If you 've been sexually active and miss your period , you might be pregnant . No matter how vigilant you 've been about birth control or condoms , there 's always a small risk of pregnancy . If you think you might be pregnant , purchase a pregnancy test at a drugstore or a health clinic ( like Planned Parenthood ) . <p> Ashton also cleared up some common misconceptions about irregular cycles : For the average teen girl , stress , poor diet , and frequent travel or exercise will not affect your period . Remember , if you 're concerned about what is or is n't going on with your cycle , talk to your doctor . <p> And if you 've ever wondered what NOT wearing a tampon or pad during your period would be like , read this brave gal 's tale of free bleeding .

@@12931061 @1531061/ <h> 7 Major Mistakes You 're Making With Your Eyebrows <p> Daily plucking is strangely satisfying for some , yet the pros warn against it . Brow specialists Michelle Wu and Santi Garay at Browhaus , an international brow and lash grooming company , say tweezing about once every three weeks is best . That way , hairs that may be on different schedules have time to grow out , which will make your brows look more even . " Overplucked brows do n't frame the face very well , " says Wu . Plus , the full eyebrow has been trendy for awhile and is showing no signs of going away . <p> 2 . Using an old pair of tweezers <p> If hairs are slipping through your tweezers or you 're struggling to bring the two points together , it 's time to invest in some new tools . And do n't let them get all gunky in your makeup bag : Clean them with a dab of isopropyl alcohol after each use to avoid bacterial build-up . <p> To avoid the dreaded unibrow , some women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A larger space between the eyes make the nose look bigger and eyes too far apart , " says Malynda Vigliotti , owner of Boom Boom Brow Bar in New York City . The beginning of your eyebrow should line up with the bridge of your nose " not the outer edge of your nostril . " The further in , the better , " Vigliotti adds . Do n't overdo it when it comes to the outer brows , either . To find out where your eyebrow should end , imagine a diagonal line from the corner of your nose to the outside corner of your eye . It may help to use a pencil as a visual guide . <p> 4 . Making too much of an arch <p> Rainbow- or paisley-shaped brows leave a face looking perpetually surprised .

Tweeze below the brow to create a lift . If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade in the shape before plucking to help you see what you 're doing better . Then , pluck around that shape " but no more than that . <p> As we said , tweezing below the brow can create a nice lift " but do n't neglect the top , Joey Healy , celebrity eyebrow stylist , told Good Housekeeping . " You want a nice , thick brow , " he says . " But there 's a difference between thick and polished , and thick and messy . " Keep the above-brow area free of stray hairs , as they tend to look more noticeable there . <p> 6 . Overusing your eyebrow pencil <p> Just a few feathery strokes with an eyebrow pencil ( never an eye pencil ; it wo n't adhere as well ) can take your brows from so-so to gorgeous and well-defined .

Use light strokes to shade in any patchy areas , and trace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shadow , not draw in your brows , " says Vigliotti . If a pencil is too much for you , Vigliotti suggests using an angled brush dipped in a brow powder that 's about a shade or two lighter than your natural hair color . <p> 7 . Never seeing a brow professional <p> If you 're at all unsure about your brow look , or made a mistake like overplucking and want to fix it , get yourself to a brow bar . Even if you only see a pro once or twice a year , they can help you find the natural shape of your brow and give you helpful guidelines for your at-home routine .

If Edward had stepped into the sunlight in Volterra , most humans would have simply wondered if some pale guy had doused himself in a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vampire . <p> 3 . And why did Edward have to travel all the way to Volterra to reveal himself anyway ? ! <p> Vampires were killed all the time by other vampires and the werewolves . Why did n't Edward just pick a fight with the Quileute tribe by breaking their treaty instead of traveling all the way to Volterra , Italy to " expose " himself as a vampire in front of the Volturi ? Then there 's the fact that fire kills vampires . Both would have been much more efficient options . So dramatic ! @qwx162444 <p> 4 . Why can Jasper manipulate Bella 's emotions ? <p> Summit <p> Bella 's mind shield is able to block any vampire power that affects her brain . That 's why Edward and Aro could n't read her mind , Jane could n't make her feel pain ( it was only creating the illusion of pain ) , and Zafrina could n't make her see visual projections she was able to make everyone else see . Alice could to see her future , though , because Bella 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the question is : Why could Jasper change Bella 's emotions ? After all , would n't manipulating her emotions technically be messing with her mind ? <p> Stephanie Meyer tried to answer this question on her website , explaining that unlike the other vampires powers , Jasper 's power is actually affecting Bella physically by adjusting her pulse and endorphins to calm her down.Why is Jasper 's power the only " science-based " power then while the rest are supernatural , though ? Considering the fact that Jasper could alter her physically , could n't Jane have just as easily inflicted pain by manipulating nerve endings ? And Zafrina could have manipulated the optic nerves . @qwx162444 <p> 5 . Why did Jasper go so crazy over Bella 's paper cut ? <p> Summit <p> Jasper is the youngest vampire in the Cullen pack so he has the hardest time resisting human blood . But one would assume that since he goes to high school with so many humans on a daily basis , he should have gotten used to minor bloody situations that tend to happen all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bloody noses , AND paper cuts ! So why did he lose complete control and try to attack Bella when she got a simple paper cut during her birthday party with the Cullens ? @qwx162444 <p> Some have theorized that Bella 's blood smelled better than other humans ' blood , but in the book , Bella was only Edwards " singer " ( the one person whose blood smells exceptionally good to him ) . So unless Bella 's blood was exceptionally tasty-smelling to all vamps , there 's still no reason Jasper should have freaked out so epically ... <p> Bella was Edward 's " singer , " and every vampire has one . But there was some indication throughout the books that Bella 's blood might have been more fragrant than other humans ' blood . James seemed to be more attracted to it in Twilight , and Alice said that it smelled particularly " nice . " Some have theorized that Bella 's blood was , in fact , special , which would explain Jasper 's reaction to her paper cut ( see #4 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it so special ? Does she have a special blood type the world has never seen before ? Is it her low iron ? WHAT IS IT ? ! @qwx162444 <p> 7 . How could Alice see future stock market trends in her visions ? <p> Alice helps the Cullens make money by seeing future stock market trends with her powers . But what 's confusing is Alice 's visions are subjective and change depending on the choices people make that may affect and change an outcome . Quick finance lesson : Stock market performance is way more complex than one person making a single decision and the company 's stock rising or plummeting as a result . Hundreds of people might decide to buy or sell a stock on any given day for different reasons , which means Alice never could have seen a reliable vision of the future when it comes to the stock market . <p> 8 . How was Bella able to control herself as a newborn ? <p> Summit @qwx162444 <p> Much of the series is spent explaining that it is a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urges to prey on humans . As we all know , Jasper could n't even handle himself around Bella 's paper cut in New Moon , and he 'd been a vampire for nearly 150 years at that point . <p> Yet , after Bella turns , it takes her mere weeks to get her urges in check . It 's explained away by suggesting that since Bella was so close to the Cullens and knew what to expect after being turned , she was able to stop herself from giving into her vampire urges . But that does n't really make sense . Bella had only known the Cullens for about 2 years at that point . How could Bella repress 150 years worth of blood-thirsty vampire urges just because she 'd known about the struggles for 2 measly years in advance ? <p> 9 . How could Bella and Edward kiss if his skin is meant to be harder than stone ? <p> Summit @qwx162444 <p> In the books , vampires ' skin is described as being marble-like in texture and harder than granite . If that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty unpleasant , if not entirely painful , experience ? Nothing like having your human lips being squished by two slabs of marble-like stone , right ? WRONG . Ouch . <p> 10 . How did Bella get pregnant ? ! <p> This is probably the most common question amongst Twihards . In the book , when a human is turned into a vampire , all their body fluids turn into venom . So if all of Edward 's body fluids are venom , that means he would n't have had any sperm to impregnate human Bella . Since venom is poisonous to humans , we 're assuming it would n't be able to work in its place to create a human life . <p> Plus , Edward uses his mouth to suck James ' venom out of Bella at the end of Twilight . But if Bella has an open wound on her wrist , would n't it be counterproductive for a vampire ( whose mouth is filled with venomous saliva ) to suck the venom out ? Would n't he have just gotten his own venom into Bella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would n't have been able to get pregnant in Breaking Dawn , because she should have turned into a vamp all the way back in Twilight . sigh

What 's up with Landon 's " appropriate punishment " ? <p> So , Landon gets caught drinking on school property and trespassing and what his principal sees as " appropriate punishment " is Landon helping the janitorial staff after school , tutoring kids on the weekend , and getting the lead in the school play . <p> WB @qwx162444 <p> Ummm , besides having to work on the janitorial staff for free , the principal basically just gave Landon two extracurriculars to put on his college applications .

How did Landon land the lead role in the school play , anyway ? <p> Let me get this straight . Landon " who has no prior theater experience " has to participate in the school play as a punishment for drinking on school property , and they hand him the lead role on a silver platter ?

You 're bombarded by what seems like a million messages about pube-grooming " friends who talk about being totally bare , waxing ads at every salon " and you 're all like : Is this THE norm ? Am I a freak ? Should I shave-it-all-off stat ? But the truth is , some girls &lt;3 a bare bikini area , while others get a little freaked by feeling exposed . Still others may be into a little bit of a trim but not all that psyched about the upkeep of taking *any* of it alllll off . ( Seriously , it can get to be a pain . ) So consider your pubic-hair stylings a very personal preference , says Jennifer Ashton , MD , an ob-gyn and author of The Body Scoop for Girls . Just like anything else you 'd do to your bod " your haircut , your nail art , your makeup routine ( or lack thereof ) " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Butwhy do I feel so much presh to go bare ? <p> Believe it or not , this trend toward full ( or even partial ) hairlessness down there is fairly recent . " It really changed drastically when porn become more readily available online , " explains Melisa Holmes , M.D. , an ob-gyn and founder of Girlology.com . Now a mini-industry has popped up around this fad " Brazilian waxes that cost more than a pair of jeans , endless options for " bikini trimmers , " etc . It 's not wrong to get rid of it , but know the forces that are at work here . And only do it if that 's what *you* like best . Period . <h> 3 . So guys h8 hair down there , right ? <p> It is impossible to speak on behalf of The Universe of Dudes ! But our very informal focus group yielded a resounding : **31;698;TOOLONG do you . And while it sucks that there 's no clear-cut consensus , we 're going to counter that with a big oldwho cares ? ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are he has hair , " says Dr. Holmes . " Hello ! Double standard ! " The bottom line is : No one move will please #TheWorld . So put pleasing YOU first ! <h> 4 . But is n't pubic hair sorta dirty ? As in I should want to get rid of it ? <p> It *can* seem to get a little dank down there , sure . You 've got tons of sweat glands and oil glands up in that area , which can make for a pretty clammy , maybe slightly odor-y environment . But it 's no dirtier than any other part of your body ! And as long as you wash it with a little bit of mild , non-scented soap in the shower , you 'll keep the hair clean . Promise . In fact " not to be gross " but some girls say they hate going totally bare because there 's nothing there to " catch " their vaginal discharge , and *that* makes them feel uncomfortable ... sometimes even red and itchy . " At the least , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening alone , because the skin there is so sensitive , " warns Dr. Holmes . " Trimming is fine , but shaving can create a problem . " Good to know ! <p> Trimming is fine , but shaving can create a problem . <h> 5 . Should I shave , or wax , or something else ? <p> Waxing is fine " and TBH , it will probably leave you with a smoother surface and slightly less frequent upkeep than shaving " but real talk : Ripping your hair out is incredibly OUCH . So only go that route if you 're down to withstand about an 8 on a 10-point pain scale . On the other hand , depilatory creams can be pretty painless , but you have to read the package and the instructions VERY carefully , because not all are made for the uber-sensitive skin of your vulva and bikini line . ( And even those that are can irritate " even burn " your skin if left on too long . ) Shaving , then , can feel like an easier and more familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your legs , so you 've got the basics down , right ? <h> 6 . I want to shave . Now how ? ! <p> OK , first up : Grab a hand mirror and some sharp scissors and trim your hair in the spots you want to shave first . This pro move will keep your razor from getting all clogged up . Then hop in the shower and clean the area with some mild soap and warm water . ( Yup , no pre-pool party , " oops-I-forgot " quickie jobs " this step is *super* important for preventing a major skin reaction ... see #8 ! ) " Any time you shave or wax , that hair follicle on your skin is going to be opened up , " explains Dr. Ashton . " That makes it easy for bacteria to enter and cause an infection . " So once you 're sure you 've washed that area well , take a brand new blade or a fresh-and-sharp disposable razor ( because , FACT : pubic hair is the thickest hair on your body ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair , i.e. in the direction it 's growing . Using small strokes " and holding your skin taut with the other hand " will help protect against nicks and cuts . And of course : Take . It . Slow . <p> Take . It . Slow . <h> 7 . Will it really grow back **29;731;TOOLONG ? <p> Nah , says Dr. Holmes . This one 's a myth ! The only thing that will change the type of hair or the speed of its growth is hormones . " It has a sharp edge after you shave , so it just feels thicker or coarser , " she says . <h> 8 . What 's with all the little bumps ? <p> So you shavedand now it 's like your bikini line is breaking out on you ? That 's likely folliculitis , aka razor burn , and it happens when bacteria get inside those little hair follicles and inflame them , causing those prickly pink-and-white bumps you 're seeing . Many times this issue will resolve on its own within a few days , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying a little 1% hydrocortisone cream ( available near the first aid stuff at the drugstore ) or an ointment with vitamins A and D/zinc oxide ( aka diaper rash cream ) . And if it does n't clear up or it 's driving you nuts ? See your doctor for a prescription for an antibiotic . " It can really , really help , " says Dr. Ashton . <h> 9 . But I just have this one BIG bump ? <p> It 's as if the hugest , most painful pimple of your life has sprung up right by your swimsuit line , huh ? Just in time to go to the beach ? #Blessed . Do n't freak , though " this simply sounds like an ingrown hair , which happens when dead skin cells clog up a hair follicle and force the hair that 's inside to grow sideways under the skin ( rather than up and out ) . Resist the urge to dig or pick , and instead , treat it once a day with a mild toner containing salicylic acid " the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this treatment works on your groin or your pelvis area , but you do n't want to apply it right up in your privates , duh ! In that case , leave it alone , and see a doc for treatment if the itching/burning/pain gets serious . <h> 10 . Wait , why 's it so darn itchy down there now ? <p> Sneaking scratches through your bikini bottoms is not a good look . But it helps to know that The Dreaded Itch is probs caused by prickly dry skin or some sort of inflammation , which itches like *cray* as it heals . If you 're shaving with soap , try switching to shaving cream , since it 'll moisturize your skin a little more . And to prevent to the tiny bumps and micro-nicks that cause aforementioned irritation , use a brand new razor and shave safe : Clean Skin , Wet Hair , Warm Water ... Ca n't Lose .

@@12931105 @1531105/ <h> 15 Surprising Ways to Heal a Pimple <p> Yes , you read that right . There 's tons of research that shows that blue-colored light can help lessen bacteria in skin . How that translates to acne ? It speeds up healing by helping to kill bacteria , explains Dr. Francesca Fusco , a NYC dermatologist at Wexler Dermatology . You can sit in front of a blue light at the doc 's office but there are also totally safe and affordable at-home masks that shine blue colored light , too . ( We like Tanda Zap or IlluMask which also emits anti-inflammatory red light to calm skin , too . ) And if you tend to get deep , super red pimples , the light is more likely than topical treatments to reach where the bacteria lies . @qwx162444 <p> 2 . Alternate between a gentle and anti-acne cleanser . <p> Sounds weird but it 's true : Using too many drying ingredients in your cleanser and treatments can actually over-dry skin and exacerbate your acne by making your skin think it needs to produce more oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pores can become even more clogged , " explains Dr. Debra Luftman , a dermatologist in Calabasas and Beverly Hills and member of the Simple skincare advisory board . Instead , use a mild cleanser that cleans and instantly hydrates like Simple Skincare Micellar Cleansing Water in the morning and use an anti-acne formula typically laced with salicylic or glycolic acid in the evening . <p> 3 . Put a sticker on it . <p> Well , one laced with pore-clearing salicylic acid , of course . Not only does it provide just-the-right amount of an active ingredient to the area , it also keeps it from getting wiped away on your pillow or wiped away . Plus , it can help you keep your hands off it , which is a big no-no , especially for deeper pimples with no whitehead . Try : Peter Thomas Roth Acne-Clear Invisible Dots . ( And see what happened when we gave these a test drive ! ) <p> 4 . Use a pimple-fighting concealer . <p> Think about it : for all the time it 's on your skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering it up . Look for a concealer laced with exfoliating and therefore pore de-clogging salicylic acid such as e.l.f . Zit Zapping Concealer . <p> 5 . Reach for over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream . <p> You know , the white creamy stuff you put on your mosquito bites or a hive . " If applied as a thick spot treatment , directly on a pimple , it can reduce inflammation quickly , " explains Dr. Fusco . In some cases it can also prevent the formation of a dark spot where the pimple was . But know that less is more and you only want to apply it right on a specific pimple once ( as in one time only per pimple ! ) and not all over your face . That 's because hydrocortisone contains a steroid , so over applying it can actually worsen a breakout . @qwx162444 <p> 6 . Always remove your makeup before you work out . <p> We get it : You barely have time to exercise and you sometimes want to look cute when you do . But when you work out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where your makeup sits " in pores , " explains Dr. Luftman . " Then you touch your face and press whatever bacteria is at the gym into your skin .

But if skin is makeup free , pores are more likely to stay in the clear and breakouts are able to heal . Try Simple Skincare Micellar Make-Up Remover Wipes before you hop on the treadmill . <p> 7 . Apply aspirin . <p> If it can take down a headache , it can take down a pimple thanks to its anti-inflammatory powers . But only use this on the big red kinds , not every single tiny whitehead that pops up .

Wear sunscreen . <p> Not only can the mineral-based formulas that contain zinc oxide ( like BeautyRx Solar Defense Sheer Sunscreen SPF 50 ) help speed up healing , the SPF will ward off sun damage that can keep a spot lingering long after it 's gone flat . But be sure to use a sunscreen that clearly states ' oil-free ' on the label so that you are n't using one that contains potentially pore-clogging oils ( note : that most face formulas for daily use are always oil-free ) . @qwx162444 <p> 9 . Ice it . <p> " Ice is a potent anti-inflammatory , especially in the face of acute inflammation like with a pimple , " says Dr. Karen . " Icing has two benefits " first , it reduces redness by causing the dilated blood vessels to constrict . It can actually take it down in terms of size and flatten it out , too . " Before applying makeup , place an ice cube on a red , raised pimple for a few 30 second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prepared that the ice will be cold and make your skin red for a bit . ) <p> Yoga poses that increase blood flow to the face ( think inversions like wheel , bridge or downward dog ) can speed up healing by delivering fresh blood to the area . That does n't mean you can do one move and expect to see results though . Practice daily at home in the morning or before bed ( at night is when skin goes into super repair mode naturally ) or hit a yoga class . Just be sure to keep skin and your mat clean and bacteria free by wiping down your mat pre and post workout with an antibacterial wipe or lay a clean towel on top . <p> 12 . Coat it with calamine lotion . <p> The pink goopy stuff you put on bug bites is super soothing . To transform it into a pimple fighter , before shaking the bottle , pour out the liquid that that pools at top so that you 're only getting the pure calamine paste , then use a cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It can help dry it out more rapidly without over drying the surrounding skin , " says Dr. Karen , who suggests applying this with caution ( a tiny dot is all you need ! ) and just once a day is enough to get the beauty benefits . @qwx162444 <p> 13 . Apply a hot compress . <p> Red , tender , underground pimples that you just know are filled with puss can be hard to reach with topical treatments since they can only seep so far down into skin . Instead , apply a warm-hot compress ( simply soak a washcloth in warm water ) to stimulate your body 's clean up crew cells to come and clear up the spot and bring the gook to the surface , suggests Dr. Fusco . <p> 14 . Put eye drops on it . <p> You know how they can instantly take the red out of eyes ? Well , it has the potential to do the same for skin . " They act like a vasoconstrictor , which means it closes down small blood vessels , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , but it can lessen the red appearance of a pimple , at least for a few hours . Add a drop directly on the spot , or soak the tip of a cotton swab then dab it right on top . <p> 15 . Try a benzoyl peroxide spot treatment . <p> While salicylic acid is a great exfoliator that can get rid of dead skin cells that can clog pores and therefore perfect to help maintain clear skin , it 's benzoyl peroxide that 's able to kill the puss inside a pimple that 's already popped up . Warning : it can be super harsh so you want to only put a tiny amount right on the pimple and do n't do it more than once a day . Plus , " it can bleach your sheets and pillowcases so consider placing a white towel on your pillowcase before bed , " says Dr. Fusco.

Here are the most common skincare mistakes when caring for acne-prone skin -- and what to do instead . <p> 1 . The mistake : Roughly cleansing acne-prone skin . Using harsh , abrasive products or tools ( such as a loofah ) can actually cause you to breakout more ! According to Dr. Warren Shapiro , Senior Vice President of Research and Development at Neutrogena , overscrubbing and using harsh scrubs can irritate your skin and make it harder for acne to clear and heal . <p> The solution : Stay away from abrasive cleansers and scrubbing tools . Use a gentle exfoliator a few times a week , and if you 're afraid of being too rough with your hands , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritating your skin . <p> 2 . The mistake : Dabbing acne medication only on pimples . Acne medications not only speed the healing of existing pimples , explains Sergio Nacht , Ph.D. , Senior Vice President of Science and Technology for Advanced Polymer Systems , they also help prevent new pimples . <p> The solution : To keep skin in the clear , apply a thin layer of acne medication ( one containing benzoyl peroxide will help kill the bacteria ) over the entire area where pimples tend to occur . <p> 3 . The mistake : Squeezing pimples . Picking at pimples can spread infection , making skin worse--not better . And , according to Dr. Nacht , the result can be scarring . <p> The solution : Use an acne medication , such as a spot treatment , and do n't touch ! <p> 4 . The mistake:Not rinsing well enough when washing your face . When you rinse , you take away suds along with dirt and oil . " If you do n't completely rinse the soap away , " says Shulman , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mistake : Skipping sunscreen . " Even if the weather is cloudy , the UV rays get through , and every exposure adds up , " says Darrell Doughty , Head of Investigative Skin Care for the Oil of Olay Skin Care Center . This can result in changes in your skin color and texture , wrinkles and fine lines appearing earlier and an increased possibility of developing skin cancer . A sunburn can dry out pimples temporarily , but it can end up making you break out even more , because your skin reacts to the drying effect of the sun by producing even more oil . <p> The solution : For optimum protection apply a facial moisturizer that contains sunscreen of SPF 15 or more every day . Look for one that says non-comedogenic on the bottle to ensure it does n't have pimple-causing ingredients . <p> 6 . The mistake : Inconsistent use of acne medications . Acne medication is n't as effective if you only apply it two or three times a week , offers Dr. Nacht . Alternately , trying to compensate by over-applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in redness and overdrying . Plus , pimples wo n't heal any faster : Skin can only absorb or utilize a certain amount of the product 's active ingredients , regardless of how many times you apply it . <p> The solution : Since acne medication works for six to 12 hours , it should be applied consistently two or three times a day . Remember , you ca n't cure acne-- just control it . <p> 7 . The mistake : Not using moisturizer if your skin is oily . If your skin is shiny or has an oily feel , it does n't mean you should avoid moisturizing . After washing , your skin 's relatively dry as a result of the cleansing process , explains Doughty . All cleansers , even water , take out some level of moisture . Using a moisturizer will replace this , protect your skin and prep it for makeup . @qwx162444 <p> The solution : Go with a moisturizer that wo n't add oil or a greasy feel . <p> 8 . The mistake : Smoking . You already know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason never to light up . " Nicotine constricts blood vessels , including those which feed your skin , " states Dr. Nacht . The complexion consequence ? Your skin becomes deprived because it does n't receive proper nourishment from your blood . <p> The solution : Do n't smoke ... ever . For clear skin as well as a dizzying host of other reasons ! <p> 9 . The mistake : Drying out the skin on your body . <p> Being in water that 's too hot or staying in the bath or shower for too long wo n't hydrate your skin and can cause skin to lose vital ingredients that help to hold moisture in the skin , explains Dr. Shapiro . <p> The solution : " Your bath or shower water should be warm enough to be comfortable , but not overly hot , " says Dr. Shapiro . " All you need is a few minutes in the shower . In the bath , you do n't want to stay in the water long enough to get that ' prune ' effect . " Set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentle cleanser , such as Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Body Gel . <p> 10 . The mistake : Drying out your skin in an attempt to control acne and oil . Using harsh soap can actually strip sebum from your skin , explains Dr. Brett Shulman , Clinical Assistant Professor of Dermatology , University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry . " Sebum helps give skin its flexibility and pliability . Without this the skin can ' crack ' and you can lose the skin 's barrier function . This increases the risk of irritation and infection . " <p> The solution : Always use a mild cleanser or cleansing bar followed by a not-too-drying acne solution containing a low percentage of salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide.

@@12931117 @1531117/ <h> 10 Questions Guys Have About Bras " Answered <p> First of all , wearing a bra is a choice . No one has to wear one . But the majority of girls choose to wear bras to support their breasts , minimize uncomfortable movement and bouncing , prevent their nipples from showing through their clothes , and to create a rounder shape . @qwx162444 <p> 2 . How do you know what size you are ? <p> Through some combination of advanced trigonometry and sorcery . Seriously . You measure right under your boobs and round to the nearest whole number . If the number is even , add four . If it 's odd , add five . This is your band size ( 32 , 34 , 36 , and so on ) . Next , measure around your boobs , level with your nipples , and round to the nearest whole number . This is your bust measurement . Subtract your band size from your bust measurement to find your cup size . If the difference is one inch , you 're an A ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're a C , and so on . You might also be an AA ( less than one inch of difference ) or a DD ( which is the size immediately after D , not E , weirdly enough ) . <p> Victoria 's Secret and most department stores offer professional bra fittings , in which a sales assistant measures you in the dressing room ( either while you 're completely topless or wearing an unpadded bra ) . Your first professional bra fitting might be a little awkward , but having an expert all up in your business can be the difference between a poorly-fitting bra and one that hugs you like a dream . <p> 3 . Why do bras come in so many different types ? <p> Because different outfits and occasions require different bras . Here 's a primer : <p> Lightly lined bras ( sometimes called t-shirt bras ) create a seamless look under t-shirts and other thin tops . These are the MVPs of any girl 's underwear drawer . <p> If a girl is wearing a top that 's light-colored or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show through the shirt . To prevent that , girls often prefer to buy bras in a shade that matches their skin tone . Too many brands , unfortunately , just stock one shade of nude " beige . ( Just like drugstores often only sell Band-Aids in beige . ) If we could rock bright pink bras with green stripes 24/7 , we would . Trust us , the temptation to buy lots of pretty , fancy bras in different colors with lace and ruffles is so real . But those bras just are n't that practical for daily wear . <p> A properly-fitting bra should n't ever be painful , but no girl would ever compare putting on a bra to strapping two fluffy clouds to her chest . Wearing a bra is similar to wearing shoes " they make you feel more secure , but less relaxed . If a bra is too small , the straps and underwire can dig into your skin in a really uncomfortable way . If it 's too big , the straps can fall down and the underwire can ride up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 7 . What 's the big deal about taking your bra off at the end of the day ? <p> Bras typically unclasp in the back with a hook-and-eye closure . If you grab the two sides of the clasp and push them lightly together , the hook will slide out of the eye . Whatever you do , do not try to pull the bra over our heads ( unless it 's a sports bra or a bralette ) . That wo n't end well . <p> 9 . What 's the deal with bras that open in front ? <p> Some bras open in the front . These bras typically have a plastic clip that you can snap open , then slide apart . <p> 10 . Are girls really impressed if a guy can unhook a bra with one hand ? <p> Nah . While that sounds smooth , even most girls need two hands . We understand if a guy needs two , as well .

Gel manicures differ from acrylic ones . Acrylic nails are made with a powder dipped in solvent . " They 're essentially used to lengthen the nail or provide a stronger top layer over the natural nail , " explains Miss Pop . Sometimes they come in colors , but usually they 're clear or natural-toned . Gels , on the other hand , come in nail polish shades , and are made hard by being cured under a UV or LED lamp . <p> 2 . Gels do weaken your nail beds , butit 's mostly because of the removal process . Many people worry about getting gels because they fear their nails wo n't be able to breathe , but nails are actually dead to begin with , so they do n't need to breathe ! Your nail beds and cuticles are what 's important " they 're made of living tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safest to get gels removed at a salon , though it usually costs $10-$20 . Just make sure the manicurist is removing your gels carefully . " No one should be scraping your nail bed aggressively . The product should just crumble off , " says Miss Pop . <p> 3 . There are ways to remove gels at home safely . If you want to save money and a trip to the salon , you can take the gels off yourself . You just have to be extra careful : You need 100 percent acetone , or better yet a gel remover you can pick up at any drug store or beauty supply store . They tend to be more expensive but are formulated to be less harsh than pure acetone . To remove , soak your cotton ball in the acetone or gel remover and place it on top of your nail . Wrap with foil . Then , wrap your hands in a hand towel " this encourages the removal process . Depending on your gel , this can take 15 minutes to an hour , depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the gel is crumbling or sliding off , gently use a rubber-ended cuticle pusher to clean the gel off of your nail bed . Do not file or scrape ! You also want to keep your nail beds hydrated . Miss Pop recommends using cuticle oil and moisturizer . " Even if you do n't have a gel mani , those products will help your nails stay healthy and strong , not to mention stave off hangnails , " she says . @qwx162444 <p> 4 . UV radiation can be dangerous to your health . " Conventional wisdom says unnecessary exposure to UV rays is bad for you , " says Miss Pop , " but they have been part of salon services forever . Those purple-colored lights that help your nails dry are actually UV lights ! " She opts out of using any UV driers or light gel-curing lamps because she has a history of skin cancer in her family , and it 's better to be safe than sorry . If you do love your UV lamp for gel or drying time , put on sunscreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge improvements in gel technology , and many brands have converted to LED curing , which does n't have the scary UV side effects . Companies such as OPI , Essie , and CND use LED lights . Ask your salon for that option . <p> Studio D <p> 5 . At-home gel kits work ! Well , kind of . Brands such as Sally Hanson , Ciate , and Kiss make at-home kits now with tiny little LED lamps . If you want to save money and have control over doing your own nails , they 're a good option to try . Generally they last a bit longer than a regular manicure " maybe 10 days " but are definitely not salon quality . You really have to follow the instructions down to the last detail and have a pretty steady hand to get a perfect gel nail . <p> 6 . Gels cost anywhere from $35 to well within the hundreds for fancy nail art . How much you 're going to pay for a gel mani really depends on where you live , but also what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one color start around $35 . That 's more than a regular manicure for sure , but they do last at least twice as long . <p> 7 . Gels generally last 2-3 weeks . The best part about gel manis is how long they last . If you have a bunch of events coming up back to back like prom , internship interviews , and family vacays , gels can be the perfect solution because they last about two full weeks with no chipping . Keep in mind , thought , that how long they last does depend on your body chemistry , the product itself , and how it 's applied . But however long your gel lasts , you 'll love your nails the entire time . =

In fact , a lot of people do it , and enjoying it does n't make you weird . In case your sex ed class skipped a lesson on masturbation , we got you covered . Ellen Kate Friedrichs , a health and sexuality educator in Brooklyn , NY breaks down what you need to know . <p> 2 . It involves more than just your vagina . Your sex ed classes might have glossed over the clitoris , but most people actually experience pleasure through clitoral stimulation , not vaginal penetration . <p> 3 . It 's totally normal . One study in 2011 found that 58 percent of girls ages 14-17 had masturbated at least once . <p> 4 . Guys do it , too . That same study found that 80 percent of guys ages 14-17 had masturbated at least once . <p> 5 . It does n't make you a bad/weird/gross person . You 're not a freak or a pervert . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't masturbate , that does n't mean you 're a prude or there 's anything wrong with you . It 's a totally normal thing that can help you explore your body and get more in tune with it . <p> 6 . It 's a helpful way to learn about your body . No two bodies are the same , so no two people like the exact same rhythms or movements . It 'll take some trial and error to figure out exactly what works for you , and it 's easier to do this without the pressure of having a partner right in front you . " You can learn about your body before you ever have sex with a partner and then , down the line , you can show a partner what you like , " Friedrichs says . <p> 7 . You might have an orgasm . When a person is aroused , their muscles tense up . An orgasm is the release of all that tension , plus a rush of an endorphin called serotonin that spills into your blood stream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make someone feel happy , giddy or sleepy , " Friedrichs says . " It can be hard to tell if you have had an orgasm since every body will experience orgasm a bit differently . But if you think of it like a roller coaster ride , with the moment before you descend being the peak of orgasm , it can help . " @qwx162444 <p> 8 . Orgasms do n't happen instantly . " Do n't give up , even if you think it is n't working , " Friedrichs says , estimating that it might take you anywhere between a minute or an hour ( or more ) to have one . <p> 9 . But an orgasm is n't necessary to enjoy the experience . " While orgasms are nice and most people can learn to orgasm , if you like masturbating and are n't orgasming , that 's fine too ! " Friedrichs adds . <p> 10 . It 's the safest form of sex . Yep , masturbation is a form of sex " solo sex . And since there 's no risk whatsoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it without worrying about your health or safety . <p> 12 . Make sure to pee when you 're done . The most common cause of urinary tract infections ( which can make you feel like you need to constantly pee and potentially lead to more serious complications ) is when bacteria from the anus accidentally travels into the urethra . You might have heard that you can get a UTI from wiping the wrong way when using the bathroom " back to front , instead of front to back " but they can also occur if you touch your anus before touching your vagina ( even if your finger just grazes the area accidentally ) . Peeing helps flush out any potential bacteria . <p> 13 . You can masturbate and still be a virgin . " Most people believe that a virgin is someone who has n't had sex with another person , not someone who has never had anything in their vagina , " Friedrichs explains . So if you insert a finger inside your vagina , but have n't had sex with a partner , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make you looser down there . Unless you 're doing it so frequently it 's interfering with the rest of your life , it 's absolutely healthy and fine to enjoy solo sex . You wo n't suddenly become looser down there and it wo n't ruin your ability to enjoy being with a partner " those are both myths . <p> 15 . If your boyfriend or girlfriend masturbates , it does n't mean they 're not into you . You can be totally satisfied with your relationship and still touch yourself . " Sometimes people worry about this out of insecurity or because they have a misunderstanding about what masturbating is all about , " Friedrichs says , noting that a lot of people report masturbating more often when they 're happy in their relationships . So if anything , take your partner 's actions as a compliment .

Not their best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this mashup " recorded as a charity single " is a passable ( albeit catchy ) rehash of iconic ' 70s punk band Blondie 's covered-to-death " One Way or Another " and Irish rock band The Undertones ' " Teenage Kicks . " Otherwise , nothing special . @qwx162444 <p> Giphy <p> 81 . " Got ta Be You , " Up All Night <p> Sure , 1D 's second-ever single was a rockin ' power ballad in its time , and it foreshadowed Liam 's destiny as the group 's go-to falsetto guy . But has it held up over the years ? Surely not . <p> 80 . " Something Great , " Midnight Memories <p> The title might be too generous , but this mostly inoffensive song 's biggest fault is burying Louis 's powerhouse ( and heartbreaking ) solo at the very end . It 's undoubtedly the best part of the track " and perhaps one of the best parts of all of Midnight Memories . <p> 79 . " Stole My Heart , " Up All Night @qwx162444 <p> In another life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the club beat it deserved to be . But why , just why is Liam so breathy ? <p> 78 . " Change My Mind , " Take Me Home <p> If we 're talking ballads , " Change My Mind " is n't 1D 's most memorable . But it 's sweet and decidedly not annoying , like some of the other ones ranked lower on this list . That 's a plus in our book . <p> 77 . " Midnight Memories , " Midnight Memories <p> If " Up All Night " from their first album grew up and joined an ' 80s cover band , bought a leather jacket , and got a YOLO tattoo , then you 'd get " Midnight Memories . " As it is , this title track probably best belongs on the next edition of Guitar Hero . <p> Giphy <p> 76 . " Over Again , " Take Me Home <p> Props to the boys for tackling these Ed Sheeran-penned lyrics . They do a fine job , but it definitely leaves you wondering what it would 've sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Save You Tonight , " Up All Night <p> Thanks but no thanks , boys " ladies do n't need your saving . <p> Getty <p> 74 . " Same Mistakes , " Up All Night <p> A decent but ultimately safe ballad , " Same Mistakes " is a nice reprieve from the dance-heavy second half of this album . <p> 73 . " Act My Age , " Four ( bonus track ) <p> Do n't get us wrong : This song is a blast . It 's the Irish dancing song/Pirates of the Caribbean theme song hybrid we did n't know we needed . But do n't start a song with " When I 'm fat and old ; " we 're not ready to imagine that just yet . <p> 72 . " Rock Me , " Take Me Home <p> " Rock Me " is pretty repetitive and chanty as far as 1D songs go , and that 's saying something . And with a nice spelling lesson during the bridge , it 's def not as sexy as it 's making itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock You " -lite beat . <p> On a rock-heavy album , this is the closest thing to the pure pop of their earlier work . It may not be their best , but at the very least , it 'd make a welcome addition to anyone 's beach vacay playlist . <p> 68 . " Do n't Forget Where You Belong , " Midnight Memories <p> Maybe this song about the boys ' undying friendship meant a bit more before , you know , Zayn up and left . But it 's the thought that counts , right ? <p> Getty @qwx162444 <p> 67 . " I Want to Write You A Song , " Made in the A.M. <p> With lyrics full of romantic gestures , this song is almost guaranteed to make your heart squeal . And while we 're digging the " Hey There Delilah " -esque guitar , the literal songwriting sound effects in the background are more than a little distracting . <p> 66 . " Right Now , " Midnight Memories <p> Lyrically , it 's not very original : Band goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But with a soaring chorus and requisite ooh-oohs , it 's fun to sing along . <p> 65 . " I Should Have Kissed You , " Up All Night ( bonus track ) <p> Pretty standard pop fare , but dang , if it is n't catchy . <p> 64 . " Up All Night , " Up All Night <p> The lyrics might be relatively tame , especially for a party anthem , but the beat is fun enough to make anyone want to dance to Katy Perry on replay , just like the boys sing on the bridge . <p> 63 . " Moments , " Up All Night ( bonus track ) <p> Despite its potentially dark subject matter " fans have speculated the song is about death " " Moments " ( written by prince of tears Ed Sheeran ) was the first real hint of what the boys could accomplish with slower , softer material . No wonder they kept it on the setlist for their first three concert tours . <p> 62 . " C'm on , C'm on , " Take Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot guy at the party forgot about his date , and suddenly , he wants to dance with you . Add that to the electro-pop beat , and it 's the stuff rom-coms are made of . <p> 61 . " Summer Love , " Take Me Home <p> Not a cover of the Justin Timberlake song , and definitely not a Grease-inspired duet between Harry and Louis . But this album closer gives each of the boys a chance to shine vocally " Niall , especially " and it 's a sweet end to a near-perfect track list . @qwx162444 <p> 60 . " Infinity , " Made in the A.M. <p> In an alternate universe , this would probably be the end credits song to a movie adaptation of a John Green novel , for better or for worse . But while the verses take their time getting off the ground , the chorus really soars " and gets stuck in your head when you least expect it . <p> 59 . " Better Than Words , " Midnight Memories <p> You ca n't deny the brilliance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonus points for a Shakira/ " Hips Do n't Lie " reference tossed in there . <p> 58 . " Still The One , " Take Me Home ( bonus track ) <p> One of the bonus songs off the gargantuan 17-track Yearbook Edition of Take Me Home ( we 're not even going to count the additional three tracks on the Target deluxe edition ) , " Still The One " is a great pop song , but it suffers for being the very last track on an album already chock-full of them . <p> 57 . " Spaces , " Four <p> Much of Four is a testament to how far the boys have come , vocally and thematically , in just four years . " Spaces , " in particular , showcases the best of what they can do as a group , even if it 's on an otherwise unremarkable song . <p> 56 . " Story of My Life , " Midnight Memories <p> Never mind the fact that people are still confused about what the lyrics mean . The main attraction here is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heralds the era of a newer , more mature One Direction . <p> Giphy.com @qwx162444 <p> 55 . " Magic , " Take Me Home ( bonus track ) <p> As its title would suggest , this bonus track is bubblegum pop at its most undeniable , with an intro you 'll be hard-pressed to get out of your head for days . <p> 54 . " Back For You , " Take Me Home <p> The other ( and better ) half to Midnight Memories ' " Right Now , " this is as good as stadium pop gets . Ca n't you just picture the boys singing this to you " and only you " from the stage ? <p> 53 . " Fool 's Gold , " Four <p> This is a beautiful song that 's as raw and open as 1D ever let themselves get . It might also be their first song to actually convince you that they 're normal boys capable of feeling heartbreak . <p> 52 . " Last First Kiss , " Take Me Home <p> What makes this power ballad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lyric : " I wan na be first , yeah / wan na be the first to take it all the way like this . " Color us intrigued . <p> 51 . " Does He Know ? " Midnight Memories ( bonus track ) <p> If you 're paying attention , then you 'll recognize the opening riffs as the melody to Rick Springfield 's ' 80s hit " Jessie 's Girl , " another homage to an era that obviously influenced this album . But what follows is quintessential 1D , from its rocking ohs to its " I 'm better than your boyfriend will ever be " vibes . @qwx162444 <p> 50 . " Little Things , " Take Me Home <p> Yes , the lyrics can get a little cringe-y sometimes ( we do n't need to be reminded of how we still have to squeeze into our jeans , thanks ) but its heart is in the right place . Thank Mr. Sheeran , again , for helping the boys slow it down on an otherwise upbeat album . <p> Tumblr/1D-TW-Things <p> 49 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boys take their cue from UK ' 90s rock band Oasis for this one . And while it 's a little slow , it 's not " Once in a Lifetime " slow , and its emotionally resonant lyrics about falling in love keep it from becoming boring . <p> 48 . " Loved You First , " Take Me Home ( bonus track ) <p> You could take the opening lines " Girl that should be me driving to your house / knocking on your door , kissing you on the mouth " to be a little creepy if uttered by anyone other than the boys , but they 're easily forgettable by the time you 're bellowing along to the final chorus with Zayn. @qwx162444 <p> 47 . " Nobody Compares , " Take Me Home ( bonus track ) <p> You 're lying if you say you 've never screamed the chorus to this song at the top of your lungs , in the shower , natch . <p> 46 . " She 's Not Afraid , " Take Me Home ( bonus track ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friends , then you 'd probably blast this jam all weekend . Sure , it 's hard to believe that any girl would be afraid of falling in love with any of these lads , but we 're willing to overlook that little white lie . <p> 45 . " I Wish , " Up All Night <p> For a song with a relatively unhappy premise ( being in love with somebody who 's in love with somebody else ) , " I Wish " is a solid jam . Maybe it 's the relatable subject matter , or maybe it 's because the chorus sounds like something taken straight out of the mid-00s , but this is a sad song we can also groove to . <p> 44 . " Night Changes , " Four <p> For the most part , this does n't differ much from their usual themes of growing up and living while they 're young . But the boys put on their best serious face for a single that 's slower and a bit more contemplative ( think T.Swift 's " 15 " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this beautiful but somewhat boring single offers them a rare chance at thoughtfulness . <p> Giphy @qwx162444 <p> 43 . " Little Black Dress , " Midnight Memories <p> The boys try their hand at glam rock , and they sound amazing . There 's not much else to this other than a loop of " I wan na see the way you move for me , baby , " but with those guitar riffs and the right balance of sexiness , what more do you need ? <p> 42 . " Heart Attack , " Take Me Home <p> Before Taylor gave us her screeching STAY ! in " All You Had to do Was Stay , " Niall had the **30;762;TOOLONG OWW ! in " Heart Attack . " This is a great punch of pop , and a highlight on an album full of highlights . <p> 41. " 18 , " Four <p> The best and sweetest of Ed Sheeran 's songs written for 1D , " 18 " tells a story of high school romance that anybody can relate to . And if Louis 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a puddle by the song 's end , then you 're not human and definitely made of stone . <p> 40 . " Ready to Run , " Four <p> Tumblr @qwx162444 <p> Basically the sequel to " Story of My Life , " this borrows from some of the acoustic elements of Midnight Memories and builds and builds until its stadium-worthy bridge . We 'll run away with you any day , boys . <p> If you think this one starts off similarly to Kelly Clarkson 's " Since U Been Gone , " then you would n't be surprised to learn that this was her song first . And bless you , Kelly , for giving it up . Do n't get us wrong " she sounds great singing it , but there 's just a special something that the boys have on their version . <p> 37 . " End of the Day , " Made in the A.M. <p> This one 's a grower , if only because it 's kinda disorienting at first listen . In fact , it sounds like two songs mashed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Harry sings " just me , her and the moon " = swoon ) , and then the preachy , slower-tempo choruses . That being said , this sort of experimentation is definitely a musical step forward for the boys , and should be more along the lines of what future albums ( yes , future albums ) put out . <p> 36 . " Illusion , " Four ( bonus track ) <p> " I promise falling for me wo n't be a mistake , " the boys sing somewhere around the 30-second mark , and they make good on that promise . While the first verse might not sound like anything special , the chorus is bright and irresistible . And fun fact : Liam wrote this for his girlfriend , Sophia , so feel free to aww the next time you listen . @qwx162444 <p> 35 . " What Makes You Beautiful , " Up All Night <p> Where it all began . This is the one that single-handedly brought boy bands back to life ( can you hear the cowbells in your head ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another group of X-Factor has-beens . <p> Giphy.com <p> 34 . " A.M. , " Made in the A.M. ( bonus track ) <p> This one 's a suitably mellow note for the album to end on , with just the right touch of nostalgia to have you thinking back to everything these boys have accomplished in the last five years . All of that combined with the fact that this features the first-ever curse word in a 1D song , you 'll probably play this at beach bonfires with your friends for the next couple years . <p> 33 . " History , " Made in the A.M. @qwx162444 <p> If " A.M. " is a campfire song , then ca n't you just imagine a singalong to this one at a 1D stadium concert ? And whether you hear this as a song Harry , Liam , Louis , and Niall wrote for each other or as a farewell track to Zayn after his departure , we dare you not to cry after Louis sings " this is not the end , this is not the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best Song Ever , " Midnight Memories <p> A great song on its own ( though maybe not the best ever ) , this was first tied to the release of their One Direction : This Is Us documentary , and then inexplicably attached to Midnight Memories , where its chorus of oh-oh-ohs and yeah-yeah-yeahs seems a little bit out of place . <p> 31 . " If I Could Fly , " Made in the A.M. <p> This ballad is a quiet stunner , simple and sweet with nothing more than a piano and the boys ' vocals . From Harry 's tender high note to the heartstring-tugging refrain of " for your eyes only , " this is as close as the boys get to making us cry Adele-level tears . <p> 30 . " Irresistible , " Take Me Home ( bonus track ) <p> It 's a shame that this song only lives on the Target deluxe edition of Take Me Home , because the harmonies and lyrical depth would 've instantly shut down the early critics who argued 1D were incapable of both . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fool 's Gold " and amps it up tenfold . <p> 29 . " Walking in the Wind , " Made in the A.M. <p> With its almost spoken verses and sweeping choruses , this is exactly what we 'd picture ourselves listening to while frolicking through a field of flowers and ... um , walking in the wind . And it 's def the best of Made in the A.M. 's three maybe-goodbye songs , just ahead of " A.M. " and " History . " <p> 28 . " Perfect , " Made in the A.M. <p> This is a by-the-numbers pop song , and probably as conventional as things get on Made in the A.M. But the chorus is irresistible ( not to mention that maybe-diss at Taylor in the bridge ) , and as the second single post-Zayn , it 's the , ahem , perfect showcase of talent for the remaining four boys . @qwx162444 <p> 27 . " Girl Almighty , " Four <p> Have the boys ever sounded this giddy on a song before ? Forget the fact that the melody goes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are completely bonkers ; we dig the retro vibe and the gusto with which the boys toast the mythical girl almighty . <p> 26 . " Stockholm Syndrome , " Four <p> The boys try their hand at extending one metaphor over the course of an entire song ( do n't worry , they have n't kidnapped anyone ) and it really pays off . The beat is the funkiest we 've heard from them yet , but the chorus has a fair enough share of whoas to clear any doubt that you 're listening to a 1D song . <p> 25 . " Happily , " Midnight Memories <p> Unabashedly more Mumford-esque than " Story of My Life " ( in a good way ! ) with a couple dashes of The Lumineers thrown in , " Happily " is a burst of sunlight on this album . If you 're not singing and stomping along to this song with your friends in a sunflower field , then you 're doing something wrong . <p> 24 . " Drag Me Down , " Made in the A.M. <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clear that " Drag Me Down " was the appropriate introduction to an album full of new sounds , even though it might not be the best one on it . But on its own merit , the song is punchy and unfussy pop-rock with a couple teases of EDM thrown in the mix . The boys sound great ( but you already knew they would ) , especially with Harry filling in for Zayn on high note duty . <p> 23 . " Never Enough , " Made in the A.M. <p> In one interview , Niall said he was proudest of this track for its " new sound " " and after one listen , we totally understand . This is so high energy that it would n't sound out of place on a previous album , but it 's just kooky enough that it 's hard to imagine it on any other album but this one . From the grunts to the maniacally high-pitched " come on ! " s , this is a weird experiment gone totally right . @qwx162444 <p> 22 . " Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Made in the A.M. ? It seems unfair to have relegated this to an EP , especially because its themes of longing and seeking comfort make it the perfect complement to actual MITAM track , " If I Could Fly . " And even though the boys have reminded us time and again that it 's okay to be vulnerable , they have n't done it quite as effectively as they do here . <p> 21 . " You and I , " Midnight Memories <p> That horrifying music video aside , " You and I " is 1D balladry at its most excellent . Simple and restrained up until the epic final chorus , this us-against-the-world song is ridiculously romantic without ever seeming like too much ( particularly swoon-worthy lyric : " not even the gods above / could separate the two of us " ) . And Zayn 's incredible high note is capital-i Iconic . <p> Columbia Records @qwx162444 <p> 20 . " Clouds , " Four <p> Take that killer intro , add a bombastic chorus , throw in a couple sassy lines ( " someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / you 're gon na want the air that I breathe / you 're gon na wish you never left me " ) and you get this no-holds-barred breakup anthem unlike anything we 've heard from them before . It 's a showstopper of a song , and the pitch-perfect end to the standard release of this album . <p> 19 . " Little White Lies , " Midnight Memories <p> This is as close as the boys have ever gotten to a dubstep-style drop in a song , and it 's a successful experiment that makes us wish they 'd try it out some more . All 1D songs make us want to dance , whether in our living rooms or alone in the bathroom , but this one would have no problem fitting in on an actual dance floor . <p> 18 . " Steal My Girl , " Four <p> Problematic lyrics aside ( no girl belongs to you , boys ) , " Steal My Girl " opens 1D 's best album yet on a high note , juxtaposing poppy lyrics such as " Every jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock melodies that would n't sound unfamiliar on a Journey or ABBA record . The boys sound ecstatic on the bombastic chorus , and we honestly ca n't blame them . <p> 17 . " Hey Angel , " Made in the A.M. <p> As far as album openers go , this is one of the boys ' strongest " and one of the most ambitious " across their five albums . And while it might not be revolutionary in terms of its lyrics , its Britpop-influenced sound makes " Hey Angel " one of their more sonically experimental songs to date , and it pays off as the perfect entry point to the rest of Made in the A.M. <p> 16 . " Love You Goodbye , " Made in the A.M. <p> This is one of those tracks that really makes you wish the boys were taking this album on tour , because it 's hard to imagine hearing it anywhere else other than a stadium lit up with cellphones ( and lighters , if people still do that ) . It might start off slow , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar riff , all the way up to a heartstopping high note from MVP Louis . @qwx162444 <p> 15 . " Through the Dark , " Midnight Memories <p> Of the two folksy , guitar-driven songs on this album , " Through the Dark " really succeeds where " Story of My Life " fails by painting a believable portrait of til-the-end romance . Extra kudos for a lovely chorus and lyrics that , you know ... actually make sense . <p> 14 . " Kiss You , " Take Me Home <p> Every now and then , it 's good to loosen up and just have fun , and that 's exactly what this is : three minutes of pure , unadulterated fun . This has just about everything you could ask for in a pop song , from ridiculous lyrics ( " I just wan na show you off to all of my friends / making them drool down their chinny-chin-chins " ) to a chorus the whole car can sing along to . And good luck trying to get that hook out of your head . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.M. ( bonus track ) <p> Essentially the sequel to " No Control , " " Temporary Fix " does n't quite match the raw , addictive quality of its predecessor , but it gets close . Still , it 's an upbeat lead-in to the rest of the bonus tracks , and it has a chorus custom-built for screaming at the top of your lungs " except maybe not the lyric about touching you where your heart is . <p> 12 . " Where Do Broken Hearts Go , " Four <p> Finally : a song with Niall taking the lead vocals , and he absolutely kills it on the first verse . From there , it 's a rousing ' 80s throwback packed to the gills with guitar solos and frantic synths , never losing any of the power or leftover energy from " Steal My Girl " and " Ready to Run " before it . We can hear the stadium-wide sing-along now . @qwx162444 <p> 11 . " Live While We 're Young , " Take Me Home <p> Yes , the beginning licks are reminiscent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 70s , The Clash 's " Should I Stay or Should I Go , " but that 's not the most noteworthy part of Take Me Home 's lead single . That honor belongs to the unprecedented task of not just recreating the magic of " What Makes You Beautiful , " but also surpassing it by a mile . It 's carpe diem in song form , best listened to with all your friends and the top down on an open highway . <p> 10 . " Wolves , " Made in the A.M. ( bonus track ) <p> There 's a reason that " Wolves " has become its own Tumblr meme ( seriously , just look ) , and it 's because this song is a playful bop that you ca n't help but dance to . Lyrically , it might be cut from the same cloth as " Steal My Girl " " minus the questionable possessiveness " but any qualms you might have about revisiting old territory immediately disappear once you hit the oooh-filled bridge , which proves that these boys still kill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 . " Fireproof , " Four <p> This was the first song any of us heard from Four , and it was an excellent tease for what to expect . Old school yet definitely mellower than the other tracks surrounding it , " Fireproof " highlights the band 's sonic flexibility : it 's the ideal kickback song , but it would n't sound out of place reaching the farthest corners of a massive arena , either . <p> 8 . " Olivia , " Made in the A.M. <p> Georgia Rose and Diana who ? This could-be-a-Beatles-song stands out for sounding like nothing else they 've ever done before ( are those strings we hear ? ) , and gets bonus points for that bold sampling of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 's " Pure Imagination " in the bridge . And even though Harry has said that Olivia is n't so much a person but more of an idea , it 's inevitable to imagine yourself in this hypothetical Olivia 's shoes while the boys sing this earworm-y love letter to you . @qwx162444 <p> 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that should 've been . Starting with that glossy opening hook , this is grown up 1D at their sexiest , from Harry 's slinky vocals on the first verse to the euphoric way Louis ca n't contain it anymore on the chorus . While there 's no questioning just what this song is about ( " Waking up / beside you I 'm a loaded gun , " really ? ) , it 's a glitter-rock triumph that deserved more attention than it got . <p> 6 . " Strong , " Midnight Memories <p> Kicking off a persistent theme of nautical imagery in their later tracks , " Strong " is a straightforward but earnest love song , and it 's their best one yet . The boys take turns spouting metaphors for endless love ( " My hands , your hands / tied up like two ships " ) that might have sounded overdramatic on their earlier albums , but register as sincere now that they 've grown up a bit . Paired with " Happily , " which comes immediately after this on the tracklist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 5 . " I Would , " Take Me Home <p> How things can change in a year . While Up All Night 's " I Wish " has the boys pining meekly from afar , " I Would " is a confident , more playful take on the same theme , only this time with more upbeat and with a greater sense of self-deprecation ( " I ca n't compete with your boyfriend / he 's got 27 tattoos " ) . While we ca n't imagine Harry ever walking alone in the rain , this song paints the boys as their goofiest and most endearing selves . <p> 4 . " Change Your Ticket , " Four ( bonus track ) <p> A rare bonus track that outshines the standard ones . The boys swap out over-production for an infectious guitar riff straight out of the 1975 's " Girls , " lending them a more mature sound that nicely bridges the playfulness of earlier albums with the soulfulness of their newer work . The lyrics asking a mystery lover to stay a couple more days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't go ! " rolls around , you find yourself wanting to linger and hear more . It 's a fantastic song all around , and as far as pop songs go , this one is timeless . @qwx162444 <p> 3 . " They Do n't Know About Us , " Take Me Home <p> If it ever bothered them being compared to other boy bands before them , then the boys do n't let it show on this track , which has them giving their best Backstreet Boys impression yet , including the mandatory piano intro and synth drum solo . But it 's also so much more than an homage to the boy bands of the ' 90s : from the spirited chorus to Louis 's tender bridge to Zayn 's inhuman vocal runs at the end , this is a 1D song in its purest form . This should go down in history as one of the best boy band power ballads ever , and when it 's this flawlessly executed , why would n't it ? <p> 2 . " What A Feeling , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this album that shines a light on 1D 's future , it 's this one . The boys have drawn inspiration from rock history as early as Take Me Home , but it 's taken up until now for them to borrow an idea from their dads ' favorite music and also make it into something that 's wholly theirs . That breezy beat might be lifted straight out of ' 70s rock band Fleetwood Mac 's playbook , but it takes the boys ' plaintive harmonizations and beguiling lyrics ( seriously , " with no way out and a long way down / everybody needs someone around " might be one of their best lines ever ) to make this the album standout that it is . Based off Liam 's tweet calling this song one of his favorites , " What A Feeling " sounds a lot like the kind of music they want to be making in the future " in which case , we 'll be eagerly anticipating that sixth album even more . <p> 1 . " One Thing , " Up All Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song that caught your interest , but this is the one that dragged you in and kept you here for five years . After all , this gave you the first glimpse of what the boys of 1D were made of , and the first real excuse to Google each of their names without shame . Whereas " WMYB " " and most of Up All Night " leans heavily on Liam and Harry for their vocals , " One Thing " gives each of the boys a moment in the spotlight , and an opportunity to steal our hearts with one of their catchiest choruses to date . There 's a reason that " One Thing " remains a fan favorite after all these years : It 's the perfect pop song , and the best reminder of why we fell in love with these boys in the first place .

Line your lips first for a precise application . <p> Kathryn Wirsing <p> Matte lipstick is super pigmented so it 's easy to get color outside the line of your lips .

Dab highlighter onto the middle of your bottom lip to get a fuller effect . <p> Kathryn Wirsing @qwx162444 <p> Bold matte lipstick can actually make your lips look smaller so this trick will help counter that effect . Highlighter adds extra volume on your bottom lip where the sun would naturally hit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlighter , like Sephora Collection MicroSmooth Baked Luminizer , to keep the matte look intact . <p> Kathryn Wirsing/Dana Tepper @qwx162444 <p> 9 . When you want to reapply , take everything off and start over . <p> Kathryn Wirsing <p> If your lipstick starts fading , it can be tempting to just pop another layer on top . But matte lipstick is too drying for more than one layer . Even Kylie Jenner recommends just one thin layer of her lipstick . Your best bet is to start over totally from scratch . Carry around a makeup wipe to touch up in between classes . <p> 10 . If you 're having trouble removing really stubborn matte lipstick , use some Vaseline on a tissue . <p> Kathryn Wirsing <p> If your lips are stained from wearing lipstick all day , affordable Vaseline will take it all off .

They never want to hang out . Your friend should WANT to hang out with you . If getting them to spend time with you feels like pulling teeth , chances are , they do n't appreciate your company as such as you appreciate theirs . Yes , sometimes people are just busy , but if someone 's really your friend , they 'll find time for you . @qwx162444 <p> 2 .

But if you notice that your friend is constantly turning down invitations to hang and then only reaches out when they happen to need a ride or want to use your new curling iron , then they 're probably using you . <p> 4 . They only talk about themselves . <p> Giphy.com @qwx162444 <p> If you find that you 're constantly listening to your friend talk about their problems , offering them advice , and consoling them , but never get the same effort in return , it 's a sign your friend does n't have your best interests at heart , or they 're just really self-centered . Both are signs they might not be the best friend . <p> 5 . They never share anything with you . The opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to your friend and sharing your deepest secrets with them , but they never return the favor , they may not consider you a close enough friend to trust you . Sure , some people find it harder to open up than others , but if your life is an open book and their life is kept under lock and key , then things are seriously one-sided and that 's not what true friendships are about . <p> 6 . They constantly dish your secrets in front of other people . <p> Giphy.com @qwx162444 <p> It 's understandable to slip up and accidentally reveal a secret every once and a while when you and your friend run in the same circles , but if your friend is constantly apologizing for " accidentally " revealing a secret that you asked them to keep between you , they 're probably not the most trustworthy friend . Either they like gossiping or they just have a blabbermouth and your secrets probably are n't safe with them . <p> 7 . They talk badly about everyone to you . If your main line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talking smack about other people , chances are they gossip and talk smack about you to other people , too . <p> 8 . They judge you . It 's one thing for your friend to be honest and offer you constructive criticism ( like when she tells you it 's probably not a good idea to get close to that guy you 're crushing on who has a girlfriend , even if he is giving you mixed signals ) .

If they ca n't deal with you and the little quirks that make you you , then that 's a sign you should cut them off . True friends will love you for you and never be ashamed for people to know you 're their bestie. @qwx162444 <p> 11 .

You might think that you just have to match the color to your skin and you 're good to go , but powder can actually be a little more tricky than that , especially , if you have oily skin . If your skin tends to get greasy , Lijha recommends going a shade or half a shade lighter . " This is because when powder touches oil , it oxidizes , " she explains . " Then the powder will possibly get more peachy or brown , depending on the shade . " If you have dryer or combination skin , however , matching your powder to your skin is fine . @qwx162444 <p> 5 .

Warwick Davis , AKA Professor Flitwick , even went so far as to say it was his favorite part of the park at a recent panel discussion , given that the British pub-inspired menu reminded him so much of home . Granted , that 's not saying much since British cuisine is notoriously not great , though not without its charms . @qwx162444 <p> At the recent opening , I volunteered as tribute and sampled many of the dishes , and have composed a rough guide of which ones will melt in your mouth and which ones will make you hurl regardless of whether or not you go on the rides . <p> 1 ) Fish and Chips . <p> WWoHP Universal Hollywood <p> A British classic , the cod is generously battered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut into wedges with crispy edges , as is the proper way . While it looks very authentic , it still has that synthetic taste that often plagues theme park food . This is also one of the oilier items on the menu , and you can really feel the grease oozing out of every bite . If , like myself , you 're a bit sensitive to high fat content , best to stay away . <p> 2 ) Beef , Lamb and Guinness Stew . <p> WWoHP Universal Studios @qwx162444 <p> This dish is rich and hearty and perfect for those cold , rainy days California is so well-known for ( LOLZ ) . The flavor is a little bland for my taste , but the fact that it comes in a bread bowl gives it major bonus points because there 's nothing better than breaking off the stew-soaked bread afterwards . <p> 3 ) Bangers &amp; Mash . <p> WWoHP Universal Studions Hollywood <p> Bangers &amp; Mash is fun Britishspeak for " sausages and mashed potatoes . " It 's a simple dish , but when executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three Broomsticks is perfect : the sausages are juicy and golden-brown on the sides , topped with caramelized onions and gravy , and placed on a bed of stewed cabbage , roasted tomato , and minted peas that lend the illusion of healthy eating . If you want to show off and be truly British , you should mush the peas with the side of your fork . <p> 4 ) Shepherd 's Pie . <p> WWoHP Universal Studios Hollywood @qwx162444 <p> My favorite item on the menu . Underneath that golden crust lies a treasure trove of minced meat and fresh vegetables stirred into bubbling , salty gravy . Because the meat is cut up into tiny portions and because it comes with salad that has a light but creamy dressing , this is also by far the most flavorful but guilt-free dish I tried . <p> 5 ) Soup and Salad Combo . <p> WWoHP Universal Studios Hollywood <p> Most of the soups are surprisingly bland despite having very exciting names , but the Potato and Leek did not disappoint . It 's chunky and warms you right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though grandma brewed it with the vegetables she grew in her garden . <p> 6 ) Lemongrass Chicken . <p> WWoHP Universal Studios Hollywood <p> It tastes like chicken , nothing more , nothing less . Nice , predictable , boring old chicken with good ol ' corn-on-the-cob as a side . @qwx162444 <p> 7 ) Apple Pie . <p> WWoHP Universal Studios Hollywood <p> Switching to desserts , the apple pie was legit . You break the crust with the spoon and let it mix with the sweet , oozing goodness inside . Needs a little more cinnamon , but otherwise , just like mom makes it . <p> 8 ) Sticky Toffee Pudding . <p> WWoHP Universal Studios <p> You can not , I repeat , CAN NOT , leave Hogsmeade without eating this delectable dessert . I mean , look at it . It 's like a gleaming tower of happiness . Unlike the other desserts , this item is 100% British , and consists of a moist cake covered in pieces of caramel and chocolate dripping in toffee sauce and a tophat of vanilla ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my laptop . <p> 9 ) Butterbeer . <p> Kevin Kolczynski <p> Served in traditional , frozen , fudge , and potted creme , the butterbeer is as much of an attraction as any of the rides . However , everyone agrees that while it 's beautiful to look at the drink , which is an enchanted amber color topped with a perfect layer of foam , it 's way too sweet . It tastes like you squirted butterscotch into a cream soda and the best part of drinking it is the novelty of holding the ice-cold mug and the fun of giving yourself a mustache from the froth .

This is obviously great news for West Coasters , who will no longer have to apparate all the way out East to get in on the magical fun . But what new delights does this long-awaited theme park have in store , and how does it stack up to its counterpart in Orlando ? We checked out the park ourselves during a sneak preview , and here 's what we 've got for you : @qwx162444 <p> 1 . It 's a lot smaller . The Hollywood park is roughly half the size of the 13-acre lot in Orlando , and while a Diagon Alley section is reportedly in the works , the current park only offers Hogsmeade and Hogwarts castle .

This wizarding world features two rides : The Flight of the Hippogriff , an outdoor roller coaster , and Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey , a motion-based dark ride located within Hogwarts Castle . The line for the latter ride rather ingeniously takes you through all the favorite spots within the castle , like Dumbledore 's office , the Gryffindor Common Room , the Greenhouse ( which offers stunning views of the surrounding valley ) , and the staircase in which all of the paintings delightfully bicker . All of this exists in Orlando as well , but the difference is that the Hollywood rides have received an upgrade : The roller coaster is higher and faster , and the dark ride has been upgraded with effects that make the images sharper and brighter .

@@12931177 @1531177/ <h> 21 Things You Should Know Before Getting Your First Tattoo <p> Getting your first tat is terrifying and exciting , and you ( and your parents ! ) probably have a million questions . How bad will it hurt ? How do you know a parlor is safe ? How much will it cost ? Here are all the things you need to know before you get inked for the first time . <p> 1 . Prices vary . Tattoo parlors adjust prices based on the size and style of the tattoo you want , and if they know you 're a tat virgin , they might try to up the price on you . It 's a good idea to call and ask for an estimate before you go in , although that may change slightly once the design is drawn . If you can , bring someone who knows tattoo pricing to help you negotiate and make sure you do n't get ripped off . @qwx162444 <p> 2 . But DO N'T go bargain hunting . Many parlors have minimum prices ( usually $50 or $100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't cost much more than that . So if someone 's willing to do your tattoo for $15 ? PASS . Sketchy artists could mean infections and shoddy work , and since your tattoo will be on your body for life and your health could be at risk , it 's an investment worth the money . While some parlors do tattoo sales for holidays , like Halloween , where you can pick a pre-drawn design for a discounted price , in general , this is n't a time to bargain shop . Instead , save up for a professional , reputable tattoo artist . " If you ca n't afford to be tattooed by the artist that you want , you need to wait until you can instead of settling for ' fast food , ' " says celeb tattoo artist , Bang Bang McCurdy , who has tattooed celebs including Kylie Jenner , Justin Bieber , Miley Cyrus , Selena Gomez , Demi Lovato , Cara Delevingne , and Katy Perry . " You wo n't regret waiting , but you can absolutely regret not waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get one . But some states will allow you to get one earlier with a parent 's permission . <p> 4 . Research the parlor beforehand . Just because the tattoo parlor is within walking distance from your dorm , does n't mean it 's a quality shop . Visit the shop and ask about their artists ' licenses , and also check out reviews online . Tattooing laws differ by state , so you should research the guidelines in your state and make sure anywhere you 're considering has the proper licensing and adheres to those guidelines . " It 's very important for a client to feel comfortable with how clean the studio is , " McCurdy says . " Ask an artist : What do you do to clean in between tattoos ? How often do you clean this station I 'm going to be tattooed on ? What kind of surface do you tattoo off of ? ' " @qwx162444 <p> 5 . The parlor should be spotless . Getting a tattoo is n't a minor change like coloring your hair . They 're literally creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't taking proper precautions . The shop should look and smell as clean as a hospital . <p> 6 . Make sure the artist opens the needle package in front of you , uses a new , disposable ink cup , and wears clean gloves throughout the process . Reusing needles can spread infection , or cause you to contract a serious illness , like HIV or Hepatitis B , so your artist should use a new , single-use needle . <p> 7 . Make sure the surface you get tattooed on is a non-porous material . Porous materials , like wood , can be difficult to fully sanitize , so it 's not a good option for a tattoo station . " A porous surface , like rock and marble , would not be something that your tattoo station should be made of , " says McCurdy . " It should be stainless steel , or a sterilizable material like stainless . " <p> 8 . Follow the artist you 're considering using on Instagram . After you have the parlor picked out , check out their artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . Follow them on Instagram to get a better feel of their work and definitely read the comments . <p> 9 . The way the design looks in the sketch is pretty much how it will look on your skin . The artist will redraw your tattoo before they apply it , so make sure you 're especially observant when you okay the design . Be extra aware of spelling ( it 's not common that you 'll get a misspelled tat , but it does happen ) , and do n't be afraid to speak up about any changes you want . Remember : This is forever . <p> 10 . If the artist makes you feel uncomfortable , LEAVE . If they get sassy when you ask them to adjust the design , leave . If they shame your tattoo idea , leave . If they just generally make you feel weird or uncomfy , leave . Getting your first tattoo is scary and they should n't be adding to your nerves or making you feel bad . " I think that in our industry it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in to speak to an artist and is going to be met with a nose-in-the-air kind of attitude , like ' I do n't want to do this girl 's silly tattoo , ' " McCurdy says . " I do n't think that it 's a fair thing or that a client should put up with that . You should find someone who wants to do your tattoo. " @qwx162444 <p> 11 . Bigger tattoos can take multiple sessions to complete . Larger designs , or ones with a lot of color can take multiple sessions to finish , so your tattoo might not be finished after your first visit . A bigger tat with a lot of detail or color might take two sessions , while an entire sleeve may take months to complete . On the other hand , a simple tattoo , like a small black star , should only take about 5 minutes . Ask your artist to give you an estimate of how long it will take . <p> 12 . Think about your tattoo for at least a year before you commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of the word ' timeless ' because your tattoo will be timeless , even if your design is not , " McCurdy says . " So you have to think about the amount of time that tattoo is going to spend on your body and the image that you 're going to put there , and the way you design it really has to be designed with the word ' timeless ' in mind . " What you think will look cool rn , may change so you want to think hard about the design and make sure you are still as into it months later . Remember : your tastes may change over time but this will last forever . <p> And while it might seem like a fun thing to do with your friends on spring break or before graduation , getting a spur-of-the-moment tat is probably not a great idea . " Think twice before jumping into a tattoo , " adds Dr. Cameron Rokhsar , a cosmetic dermatologist who often deals with tattoo removal . " Do n't do it on a whim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all the stories I get from my patients . Tattoos of boyfriends and girlfriends are a no-no " people always regret it . " <p> 13 . Do n't get inked before your beach vacay . The quote you want on your rib cage will look great with that sassy cut-out swim suit , but tattoos take at least two weeks to heal , so you wo n't be able to swim ( pool chemicals and ocean bacteria are bad for a healing tattoo ) or hang out in direct sunlight ( even healed tattoos are sensitive to UV rays ) if you get it on spring break . Your best bet : Just wait until you get home and make sure to wait at least a few weeks before you plan to spend time in the sun , or at the beach or pool . @qwx162444 <p> 14 . You 'll have to get your tattoo touched up . Tattoos fade over time no matter how well you treat them , because your skin is always shedding new layers . So eventually you 'll have to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can go to any artist to get it touched up , but if you liked your original artist and their work , it 's always best to go back to them . A lot of parlors will give you a touch-up for free , but others charge . Like normal tattoos , touch-up pricing varies based on the amount of work you need done , so if you 're curious , ask your artist for an estimate . <p> 15 . Tattoos fade faster in spots that are often in direct sunlight . " There are certain parts of your skin that are exposed to more sun , so pigments can break down quicker , " McCurdy says . " Like the outside of your arm , it will age differently than the inside of your arm that is n't exposed to as much sun throughout your life . " If you 're outside a lot and worried about fading , considering getting inked in a spot that 's less exposed like the inside of your wrist . <p> 16 . The pain depends on the tattoo 's placement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that being said , pain tolerance differs for each person . Generally , though , tattoos placed right over bones tend to hurt the most . So a tattoo on your foot or ribs might be an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 , while a bicep tat might only be a 4 . And of course , the bigger the tattoo , the longer you 'll be in pain . @qwx162444 <p> 17 . If you do n't end up liking your tattoo in 10 years , you can get it covered up . It 's pretty easy to get a tattoo covered up , especially if it 's small . A good artist can put a new design over it , covering the original tattoo completely " some parlors even specialize in cover-ups . So even if you do change your mind one day , you wo n't be stuck with tattoo that you hate . <p> 18 . Or you can get it removed . You can get your tattoo removed with a laser treatment . Depending on the ink color , stubbornness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can take several sessions , or just one . Blue , black , and green inks are easier to remove with laser treatment.Dr . Rokhsar says that the lasers can detect those colors more easily , so they remove them more accurately . Lighter colors , like yellow and white , are more difficult to remove . While the process eliminates the tattoo , it can leave scarring and the procedure can be pricey . <p> Salons offer the service , but since they are not medical professionals , you should never use them for tattoo removal . Go to a real , licensed doctor to get the procedure done . If you 're worried that it will hurt or heard horror stories of people who got tattoo removed , the procedure is safe and can be very painful when not done by a doctor . " Removing a tattoo , actually , is not painful at all . If you go to a doctor , the doctor will numb it ... with a local anesthetic , " Dr. Rokhsar says . " When you read about people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not going to doctors . They 're going to various spas , not medical doctors . Spas can not administer anesthetic injections . A doctor can can administer local anesthetics , so you 'll feel zero pain . " @qwx162444 <p> 17 . You might not be able to get the exact tattoo you want . If you want to get a lyric in a really tiny font , your artist might refuse . If a font is too small , it can bleed together over time , so the designer might ask you to compromise with a little bigger font . Remember : Your artist is an artist and a professional , so if they have some serious feelings about your design , hear them out . <p> 18 . You may have to be shaved first . If they 're tattooing your arm , or another particularly hairy part of your body , they might have to shave the spot beforehand " like a doctor would before a surgery . You can ask in advance if you should shave the area before coming in , but most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will itch afterward . During the healing process , new tattoos will itch , kind of like a scab . But make sure you do n't scratch it , because you can peel off the ink , leaving spots of un-tattooed skin on your tattoo . ( If you do accidentally scratch some ink off , your artist can fix it . ) Dr. Rokhsar says scratching can also lead to infection , so instead , slap your tattoo gently for relief . He also recommends trying using a Cortizone cream to take away the itch safely . <p> 20 . Avoid long showers after you get inked . It 's important to keep your new ink clean by gently washing the area with anti-bacterial soap and water , then patting it dry three times a day . And a little water wo n't hurt it , but try to avoid spending too much time in the shower or bath after getting inked . Soaking your tattoo is n't good for it , because the water will slow down the healing process by deteriorating your newly-forming skin . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets a lot of water in the shower , like your back , try to keep your showers short and limit the area 's contact with water until it heals . <p> 21 . You CAN be allergic to the tattoo ink . While it 's not common , ink allergies do happen . " I 've seen patients who are allergic to some components of some inks where they become super inflamed , " Dr. Rokhsar says . If you 're worried , he recommends doing a spot test first . " They can do a test where they put the ink under your skin and just wait a few weeks , " Dr. Rokhsar adds . If you do react badly , the tattoo might become inflamed , but Dr. Rokhsar says it can be treated with steroids from your doctor .

" @qwx162444 <p> Joanna , 15 , San Jose , CA <p> Rosy cheeks are only fun when there 's flirtation involved ! If you want to just cover the redness , use a green-tinted concealer , which neutralizes redness and helps create an even skin tone ( try Physicians Formula Gentle Cover Cream Concealer in Cover Green , $6 , drugstores ) . Dot the concealer over your flushed areas and blend before putting on the rest of your makeup . However , if the redness never goes away or seems to be worsening over time , you may have a condition called rosacea . In that case , make an appointment with a dermatologist . He or she can prescribe medication to help control the symptoms and get you back to blushing for fun !

It might be because the boys in your class understand your weird , twisted sense of humor and they 're into all the same sports teams , or maybe it 's just because you 've been friends since middle school . One thing 's for certain though : It 's not because they 're less drama . In fact , sometimes it feels like the opposite . @qwx162444 <p> 1 . Your girl friends are convinced that you and one of your guy friends secretly love each other . How many times do you have to say there 's nothing romantic going on between you ? Just because you get along and have a great time together does n't mean you 're soul mates , gosh . <p> 2 . Whenever they learn something new ( and gross ) about periods , they feel the need to confirm the information with you . <p> 3 . They 'll never understand your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally connect when it comes to your love for the Cubs , but they always draw a blank when you start fangirling over One Direction ( or whatever boy band you 're into at the moment ) , or obsessing over Kylie and Tyga 's latest snapchat vid . Whatever . You do n't have to connect on everything . @qwx162444 <p> 4 . You are expected to speak for all girls in existence . You do n't have all the answers , ok ! <p> 5 . They talk about gross guy things around you . You get it . You 're one of the guys . But that 's where you DEFINITELY draw the line . You are not that close . <p> Giphy <p> 6 . They 're brutally honest about whether or not your crush likes you . Even though it hurts , you probably need to hear it . Your girlfriends are jumping through hoops to explain why that guy from study hall ghosted you , because they 're your number one fan and want you and your crush to work out . But your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that likes you would n't ghost you , so it 's time to move on . <p> 7 . At the same time , their friendly advice is useless . Their idea of making you feel better after a breakup usually consists of something like , " Eff them , " or " Whatever , they do n't deserve you then , " and then they move on . But you kind of need to rehash your entire relationship and figure out what went wrong for the next three weeks , and it definitely is n't a " whatever " situation ! @qwx162444 <p> 8 . Guys are afraid to ask you out because they think you 're dating one of your guy friends . It 's like you need to wear a sign that advertises your single status 24/7 in order to get across that you and your guy friends are just , well , FRIENDS . <p> Tumblr <p> 9 . Or they 're convinced you 'll end up dating one of your guys friends . They say that they were friends with their ex first and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " Your point ? " The key is that YOU do n't want anything romantic with your guy friends , so it should n't matter . <p> 10 . Your guy friends get protective if they do n't like the person you 're into . The thing is , they 're horrible at expressing why they do n't like them . When you ask them why , they 're just like , " F*** them , " or " He 's a jerk ! " And you 're just like , but WHY ? ! @qwx162444 <p> 11 . And expressing feelings is pretty much not a thing . You have to bug them and bug them to admit they 're hurting after they get totally crushed by someone they like , because it seems like they 're neurologically incapable of dealing with their feelings . <p> 12 . It amazes you that your guy friends do n't even talk to each other about feelings . You do n't take it personally when your BGF wo n't open up to you about his breakup because he wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two closest girl friends every single thing that your bae says and does . Your girl friends pretty much write every other text you send to your S.O . ( particularly when you guys are fighting ) . But your guy friends just do n't do that with each other and that 's the way it is . <p> 13 . One of them is absolutely in love with you . No matter how much you all swear you 're " just friends " and that 's it , things will inevitably get complicated with one of them . <p> Giphy @qwx162444 <p> 14 . And then your other guy friends will try to be that guy 's wingman and make it happen between you two . Which just makes EVERYTHING really awkward . <p> 15 . If you shut down one of your guy friend 's advances , you feel like you ca n't hang out with them like you used to anymore . Even if the one crushing on you tries to be cool , the fact that he has a crush on you will haunt you every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over whether or not you 're inadvertently leading him on . <p> 16 . Or he does n't try to be cool about it , and accuses you of friend-zoning him . Ummm , there 's no such thing as friend-zoning . You ARE friends . You do n't have to like him just because he likes you . And any guy that says this does n't need to be your friend anyway . <p> 17 . If you 're the one with a crush on one of your guy friends , you 're terrified they 'll find out . Which would put your awesome friendship in jeopardy . <p> 18 . People who do n't know you assume that you just do n't like girls . Which is n't true . You love girls and def have close girl friends . You just happen to have more guy friends .

@@12931211 @1531211/ <p> The character of Jeff Atkins in 13 Reasons Why , played by Brandon Larracuente , was just awesome . He was a jock , but he did n't let that get in the way of being super cool to the less popular Clay . His genuine personality made you fall in love with him . Which is why you were a sobbing , blubbering mess for at least three days after he died in a shocking car accident on the show . @qwx162444 <p> Jeff Atkins deserved better . I repeat : JEFF ATKINS DESERVED BETTER . <p> There 's been a lot of speculation about whether or not Jeff having had a couple drinks earlier in the night contributed to his accident or if it was only caused by the missing stop sign Sheri accidentally downed . But Brandon wanted to make one thing clear : That 's all details , because Jeff should n't have been on the road at all . <p> Seventeen.com had a long chat with Brandon about his character and the events that led up to his tragic death in the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 Reasons Why shed light on . Read on to find out the important lessons he took away from the show , how he feels about Sheri as a character , and more . <h> 17 : What was the process like landing this role ? <p> Brandon : " It was a pretty lengthy one . I had auditioned originally for the role of Justin Foley . I sent in a self-tape from my home in Florida . I flew out to California shortly after for unrelated stuff and just happened to receive a callback while I was already in California . I went in and they brought me back several times after that . At the final callback they offered me the role of Jeff , who is n't a character in the book . " <h> 17 : Was the idea of playing a brand new character exciting or intimidating ? <p> Brandon : " It was exciting because I did n't have to follow guidelines . I could just kind of build the character originally the way I wanted him to be . They gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I appreciate . " <h> 17 : Did you know from the beginning that Jeff was going to die ? <p> Brandon : " Actually , I knew from the first day I began filming . They told me his fate unfortunately . At first I did n't know how to feel about it , but then after a while , I was like , ' I have every episode to make a positive impact . ' I just try to look at it in a positive way and every character on this show serves a purpose . I made sure my character severed his purpose before his unfortunate accident . " @qwx162444 <h> 17 : Was it important to show that not all jocks are jerks ? <p> Brandon : " Absolutely . We could even take it a step further . I think it just shows the message we were trying to portray . Spread kindness to everyone , not just the person in your ' clique . ' I think kindness can be spread genuinely as long as you know both parties are willing to put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat everyone equally no matter what background they come from , or profession , or race they may be . " <h> 17 : There 's been a lot of speculation about what caused Jeff 's accident . It seemed like he was n't drunk . Plus , the stop sign was missing . Why do you think the writers added that ambiguity to the story ? <p> Brandon : " I hear a lot of people from my own experiences say , ' I 'm a great drunk driver , ' or ' I only had a few drinks . ' I hope people can learn from this that one drink is too many . It does n't always necessarily have to be your fault . You can see from the story , it was n't Jeff 's fault the stop sign was down . But it 's important to always be vigilant and aware . Luckily there are apps like Lyft and Uber that we can now use to get people home . I think it 's great that the show raises awareness on so many issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Could Jeff 's accident also be sending a message about underage drinking as well ? <p> Brandon : " You know what , I 've never looked at it that way wow , that 's actually a great analysis . Drinking underage is illegal . I do n't want to say it 's karma , but maybe it was the universe 's way of saying if you do the wrong thing , bad things can happen . Yeah , wow , I never looked at it that way . If he was n't going for a beer run and underage drinking , he never would have hopped in the car and gotten into an accident . It happens way too often . It 's funny " I never even went to my first high school party until after my senior year was coming to an end . My parents were a little strict . But looking back at it now , I do n't regret it one bit . I applaud them and I thank them . " @qwx162444 <h> 17 : What was it like filming the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was , considering all I had to do was really lay there . It was tough . Every time we would film , Dylan ( Clay ) would run up to the car and he would have to come up to the car and react . And his performance " I would get chills . It was hard not react to . So we had to do it over and over . It was hard to see myself looking back on the monitor after a few takes . Honestly , it taught me a lesson . It taught me to never take a risk like that . Drinking and driving is never okay because life is so short . <p> " I think the episode where I passed away , Clay was like , ' See you Monday ? ' and I looked at him and said , ' Yeah , ' absolutely not knowing that that was the last time I 'd see him . So it 's hard . Dylan gave a performance and being a part of it " it definitely gave me chills then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I never want to see you like that . ' Spoken like a true mom . " <h> 17 : Let 's talk about Sheri . Just like Jeff , she had very little to drink at the party . But she inadvertently contributed to Jeff 's death by not reporting the stop sign she downed while looking for her charger . And that 's such a tragic and complicated situation . What lesson do you think she learned from this whole experience ? <p> Brandon : " Accidents happen . I think she was so afraid " maybe because her dad let her take the car out that night and said do n't do anything stupid and she ends up knocking down a stop sign . I think fear kicked in at that point . She let that fear take over and instead of doing the right thing in the moment , she chose to do the wrong thing . I know when it comes people , they sometimes look at life like no one is around . How 's it going to impact the world ? Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could leave our keys at home by accident and then get pissed because you have to walk all the way back home and get your keys . But then you avoid an accident that 's destined to happen down the road because you would have been there if you had been a few minutes earlier . So , I think everything happens for a reason . So , I think Sherri 's purpose was to show you that it 's okay to admit your wrongs . Because the truth will always come out . No matter what , the truth always , always comes out . @qwx162444 <h> 17 : What has the fan reaction been like for you ? <p> Brandon : " It 's been pretty crazy . It 's been a blessing in a way because I hope every single person in the cast with this increased following " we can all do our part to try and change people 's lives now . We 've been put in the spotlight as far as social media goes . In reality , we have 500,000 followers , 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's our job to affect those people 's lives . Whatever the number , I think it 's our job and duty . So many people are looked at in the public eye as role models . I do n't think they got there by any fluke . People look up to them and people look up to us now and we have to take on that task . Affecting people 's lives is so much more important than posting a picture and getting a million likes . If we could reach one person going through the same things as Hannah , Clay , Jeff or anyone in the cast with a post , that means more than anything to us. <h> 17 : There 's been talk of a second season in the works .

And if they do end up picking it up for a season two , I trust them . We left a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a second season all of those questions be answered .

There are so many other talented actors , but I had the honor of working with Suicide Squad director David Eyre . It all happened so quick I tried in the moment just to soak it all in while there because it was such amazing experience . It comes out in December . "

My decision to go so far away had nothing to do with hating my home or wanting to run away . My main motivation was my desire to study international relations . Unfortunately , I ca n't study international relations in Montana . Plus , most internships in my field are in D.C. or New York . So for me , it was n't an option , I had to go ! It 's definitely hard at times , but , honestly , I do n't regret my decision at all . I love it here ! I am so happy I had this opportunity and would n't change it for anything in the world . So for those of you girls who want to go far away , or for those of you who are just curious , here are some pros and cons to going super far for college ! <p> Pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scary , it can also be such a bonus ! You ca n't go home once a month or whenever you want , which makes you really dependent on yourself alone . I think this forces you to grow up that much faster and really be independent , so you 'll be more prepared for the " real world " after you graduate . <p> jenna and friends <p> Con : One of the biggest problems I 've faced is dealing with the fact that my friends and family are in a different time zone . When you want to call home in the morning you ca n't because your family is n't awake . If you want to call at night you have to stay up later to fit in with their schedules . It 's tough , but it 's worth it to keep in touch . @qwx162444 <p> Pro : The best thing about going so far away is getting to meet all new people ! A lot of my friends who stayed in town still hang out with the same group of people they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school , I also want to make new friends in college . Being somewhere where you know absolutely no one forces you to meet new people , because you do n't have the crutch of already established friends . <p> jenna in dc <p> Con : A big problem with going far away is the chance of curveballs coming your way . One of my friends here has a parent who got diagnosed with cancer the week after we moved in . Being so far away is super hard on him because he ca n't be around his dad as much as he would like . @qwx162444 <p> Pro : By expanding your environment and your friend group you get a totally different worldview ! If you hang around with only one group of people , in one area of the U.S. , you will keep getting the same perspectives .

Cranberry Sauce <p> Some people make cranberry sauce from scratch and , apparently , it can be very delicious , but for most of us , this stuff just comes plopped out of a can , and it 's all kinds of gelatinous grossness. <h> 9 . Green Beans <p> Getty <p> You eat green beans all the time . It 's pretty much an every day kind of food . Which is why on Thanksgiving , when there are such amazing side dishes that could be taking up room on your plate , green beans just feel like a waste of space . <h> 8 . Rolls <p> Getty @qwx162444 <p> Rolls fall pretty low on the list because they 're really , pretty hit or miss , depending on your fam 's policy on rolls . Some people just get store-bought roles and they 're meant to help soak up the extra sauces and juices on your plate , but have no personality of their own . But some people make homemade biscuits and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot and soft so that the butter melts when you put it on top . In which case : yum . <h> 7 . Gravy <p> Getty @qwx162444 <p> Gravy only falls so low on the list because it 's more of a dressing than an actual food , but it 's really Thanksgiving 's unsung hero . It can literally go on almost anything and make it a hundred times better . Your turkey a little dry ? Throw some gravy on it ! Grandma 's potatoes need some more flavor ? Pass that gravy ! <h> 6 . Sweet Potato Pie/Pumpkin Pie <p> Getty <p> There 's a bit of a war going on between pumpkin pie eaters and sweet potato pie eaters . While families that cook pumpkin pie every year insist that it has a unique taste all its own and would beat out sweet potato pie in a second ( it 's all about the texture and the texture of a well-made pumpkin pie beats out SPP every time ) , sweet potato pie eaters would definitely beg to differ ( it 's all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver the unique blend of spices , blah blah , more foodie talk ) .

Corn Bread <p> Getty <p> Not everyone eats corn bread on Thanksgiving , but those who do , know that it 's the best of bread , sweet corn , and warm butter mixed into one . And it 's crumbly , melt-in-your-mouth goodness is its final selling point . YUM . <h> 4 . Stuffing <p> Getty @qwx162444 <p> Stuffing is a Thanksgiving staple for so many reasons , but mostly because it brings together all the best things Thanksgiving dishes into one delicious side dish .

Some people add sour cream and butter to make it as fluffy as a cloud and that 's what it literally tastes like . A buttery cloud . How could you not love this ? @qwx162444 <h> 2 . Sweet Potatoes <p> Getty <p> The best thing about candied sweet potatoes is that it 's basically a desert disguised as a standard dish . It 's basically sweet potatoes mashed up and mixed with tons of sweet stuff like cinnamon , nutmeg , and brown sugar and then topped with even more sweet stuff like marshmallows or pecans and even more cinnamon and brown sugar . So it 's dessert for dinner , basically . <h> 1 . Turkey <p> Getty <p> Turkey has to come in first place , just because , well , it 's TURKEY , which is THE Thanksgiving staple . The thing that parents slave over for hours on end , basting and seasoning to perfection . Some people like it golden with just a bit of crunch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin burnt and chewy . Some people ditch the skin all together and just dive into the meat . That 's what 's so special about it .

And you know what ? That 's probably NBD , because life is hectic . And sometimes , you 're legit not hungry . But when your decision to bypass breakfast or ditch out on dinner is maybe driven by a sneaky little diet thought ( " well , cutting a few calories ca n't be SO bad " ) " your one-time choice could spiral into a habit that can hurt you . " Skipping meals is n't just a gateway to eating disorders like anorexia " it 's also one of the biggest predictors of overeating and unhealthy weight gain , " explains Kimberli McCallum , MD , a psychiatrist in St. Louis . Here 's *exactly* how your body rebels as you push it closer and closer to starvation mode " and why eating healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . @qwx162444 <p> 1 . Your brain turns into MUSH . <p> Let 's say that last night you made acquaintance with a delicious pepperoni-and-pineapple pizza and consequently pushed it a slice ( or two ) past your usual limits . So to compensate , you think : " Bright idea = , I 'll skip lunch ! " But even after missing a single meal , your body is all like , HELL NO . And your blood sugar takes a dramatic nosedive " dragging your ability to think straight right along with it . " Your brain runs primarily on glucose , " explains Kristin Kirkpatrick , RD , manager of wellness nutrition services at the Cleveland Clinic . " When there is n't enough sugar in your blood to pull from , you lose your ability to focus . " In other words , it 's not *just* those hunger pangs and visions of French fries keeping you preoccupied in Spanish class . Your brain straight-up ca n't function .

Much like your concentration , your mood plummets along with your blood sugar " turning you into a snap-at-everything mess who also lacks the literal brainpower ( see above ) to realize she 's being a beast . But it gets even worse if you continue missing meals . That 's because fasting kicks your body into survive-at-all-costs mode , triggering the primitive stress response you needed to outrun predators back in the day . " You start to feel jittery and anxious , and your big picture thinking turns off , " says Dr. McCallum . This flood of stress hormones translates into MAJOR outbursts and deep depressions in situations where you 'd normally just shrug off the drama or disappointment . Basically , you become the moodiest , least-fun version of yourself . @qwx162444 <p> 3 . You 're soooo much more likely to overeat . <p> Ironic , huh ?

Fact : You 're more likely to gain weight , too . <p> Yup , the overeating thing has something to do with it . But the real danger kicks in as you move from skipping a meal here and there to severely restricting yourself . At that point , you actually start messing with your metabolismand storing everything you eat as fat . " Our bodies are programmed to survive at all costs , " explains Kirkpatrick .

Most girls start menstruating anywhere between 9 and 15 years old , often around the time that other women in their families got theirs .

Both products require a prescription . Emergency contraception works by inhibiting or delaying ovulation , preventing fertilization , or preventing implantation of a fertilized egg .

It also does not protect against future acts of intercourse , so it is important that you use another form of birth control if you have sex again . <p> Generally , emergency contraception costs $55 and upwards ( the price includes examination , pregnancy test , and pills ) ; costs can be less -- or even nonexistent -- at family planning clinics and health centers .

The hard pavement was filthy , the buildings crowding too close together , but the lights were bright and beautiful . And the streets were full of monsters . Jace had only seen them before in his father 's instructional manuals . Vampires in their finery , faces dead white as paper . Lycanthropes with their too-sharp teeth and their smell of wolf .

But how could a human girl see through his glamour ? <p> He had woken up shivering , cold as if his skin had been stripped away . It was frightening to feel so vulnerable , more frightening than any demon . He would have to ask Hodge about runes for nightmare protection in the morning . Perhaps there would be something about it in one of his books . <p> But there was no time now .
