And while their advice is honest and valuable no doubt , pregnancy is a uniquely magical , highly individual experience . While many aches , pains and elation that expectant mothers experience during gestation bear similar qualities , no two fetuses will form the same , as will no two pregnancy symptoms will parallel one another . <p> However , one of the most crucial aspects to a safe , healthy gestation period is monitoring and planning , from both your doctor and you .

Be sure to log any of these initial body changes in your pregnancy calendar . <p> Doctors visits will likely consume a fair share of your time during the first trimester , as your practitioner will likely perform a series of blood , pap smear and urinalysis tests to ensure the long-term health of your pregnancy . <p> Second Trimester : Settling In <p> As the gestation period progresses , expectant mothers can expect to start feeling some fetal movement in their second trimester . <p> By the 21st week of pregnancy , most babies begin feeling the urge to stretch their tiny limbs , offering up some serious jabs for their mommys tummy .

When a school uses the Response to Intervention model , periodic testing is used to ensure that students have a positive response to interventions that the teacher selects . An RtI lesson plan template is a useful tool to ensure that all of the data tracking obligations are met . <p> For educators to succeed in this model of service delivery , a great deal of data must be maintained in an organized fashion . Testing dates , results , and changes to the selected intervention must all be tracked for future analysis and decision making purposes . <h> About the RtI Lesson Plan Template <p> One item to note in the RtI lesson plan template is the name and type of intervention used . When a teacher is required to give multiple interventions to multiple students , it is vital that the data recorded matches with the appropriate intervention . The data is useless if this does not happen . <p> For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select for a student to improve their reading fluency . A raw score of 27 might mean a positive result for a specific intervention . On a different intervention that uses a different time frame for assessment , that same score would indicate a major problem . <p> Another important piece of data to include in the RtI lesson plan template is the date of the test . Students change a great deal over the course of a school year . A score on a progress check in September means something completely different from that same score occurring in May . Since the goal of Response to Intervention is to indicate how a student responds to an intervention over time , the date is an extremely important piece of the data picture . <p> Since interventions in the RtI model are based on research and their proven impact on student learning in prior use , the fidelity and integrity of the interventions implementation is crucial to the process . Therefore , if any changes are needed when administering an intervention , those changes should also be marked on the template @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementation changes create a positive or negative impact on the students performance . <p> A final piece of information to include on the template is the intended outcome for the lesson . Otherwise known as the target skill , every lesson in the RtI model is designed to show improvement in a specific skill area . In the past , teachers could say that a lesson was designed to improve student reading . With the Response to Intervention model , a teacher must be much more specific with the intent of their lesson . This intent should also be denoted in the template . <p> The use of this template will allow the teacher to keep track of all the important factors that go into effective Response to Intervention planning . The finished product will contain all the information in one place that the teacher needs to make informed , data-driven decision about the education of their students in the RtI model .
