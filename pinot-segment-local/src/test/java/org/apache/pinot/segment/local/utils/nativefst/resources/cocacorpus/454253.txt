@@7515531 @715531/ <h> CarPro Iron X 1 Liter ( 34 oz ) <h> CarPro Iron X 1 Liter ( 32 oz ) <p> CarPro Iron X advanced pH-balanced ( pH-7 ) formula safely breaks down ferrous metallic contamination caused by automotive brakes , rail travel , and construction from delicate vehicle surfaces . It can be used on paint , plastic , chrome , glass , and alloy wheels . Iron-X works by forming a water-soluble complex with the iron particles lodged in the surface , allowing them to be rinsed free , and cleaning deeper than washing or claying alone . Available in Original , Lemon Scent , and concentrated Paste formulas for stubborn contaminants , Iron X is the original and still the best acid-free iron fallout remover . <p> The IronX Paint and wheels Decontamination System was developed as a method of removing paint contamination beyond what can be removed by washing or claying alone ! If you are familiar with detail clay , you know it is capable of removing above surface contaminants that have bonded to the paint . The IronX is designed to remove what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Airborne chemical compounds and ferrous particles ( particles containing iron ) actually penetrate the paint and create corrosive compounds that eat deep into the paint 's sub-layers or paints pin-holes . This is a gradual process that often is not evident until it 's too late . Claying does not remove the entire particle which will continue to spread beneath the surface if not dissolved . <p> During the use of your vehicle , brake dust and road grime become sintered to the surface of the car paint , rims and wheels due to the high temperature conditions they are normally exposed . Brake dust contains high levels of iron and once sintered to the rim , becomes extremely difficult to dissolve or remove without the use of harsh chemicals . Iron X opens up the paint 's pores to release ferrous particles and to neutralize caustic compounds that have developed in the paint 's subsurface . Ongoing damage is immediately stopped and future damage is prevented by removing the ferrous particles . <p> Iron X sprays on as a transparent liquid . As the cleansing liquid begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn purple/ red . The purple/red coloration is the Iron X Cleaner forming a bond to the sintered iron on the car paint and wheel and changing its state to a water soluble complex for easy removal . Stubborn , baked on grime may take a small amount of agitation . Rinse car paint and wheels thoroughly with a power washer and wipe dry . <p> CarPro Iron X is used by body shops for pre-cleaning prior to detailing and by dealerships for new and used car prep . It is proven to deliver a clean , glassy smooth vehicle that is protected from the harmful effects of paint contamination . No other is as fast and effective at removing multi-layer paint and wheels contamination . <p> Features : <p> Removes Iron Particles and prevents the spread of iron-related damage &amp; helps to protect your vehicle from paint system failure . <p> Safe for use on all solid car surfaces and will not deteriorate clear coats .

This is not required but is how I like to do it for best results . <p> D.-For best results apply to a mostly dry surface . A few drops of water is ok . <p> 1. -Shake the bottle . <p> 2. -You can cover the surface with Iron X by spraying it everywhere but that can be wasteful . I recommend that you spray as needed and spread it with a small sponge or applicator to cover the entire surface . You may also consider using an atomizer type spray bottle or HVLP gun . In any case evenly cover the surfaces you wish to decontaminate . The product is strong so you do n't  have to be wasteful . Just make sure it contacts the entire surface . <p> 3. -Allow the product to dwell for 5 minutes in the shade . Do not allow it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see the product dissolving ferrous particles as it turns color . On darker colored paints everything is happening in exactly the same way . Its simply more difficult for you to view the color changing affect . I have read people saying the product works better on lighter colored cars but that is illogical and is not the case . It works the same regardless of car color . <p> 4. -After allowing to dwell take a damp ( not soaked ) grout or other paint safe sponge ( or other media if you prefer ) and agitate the surface . <p> 5. -Thoroughly rinse the surface . <p> Do n't  forget to rinse your media out also . I like to have a dedicated Iron X sponge but that is n't necessary . <p> Iron X Facts and Frequently Asked Questions : <p> How iron particles appear on your car surface and where ? <p> Iron particles are all around us , and ofcourse on our cars after traveling through the environment . They can be made from your car braking , driving near other cars , big trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the car surface and once they " stick " to your paint due to there sharp edges together with sunshine they start to bake into the soft car paint layer where they oxidize and rust . <p> How to prevent iron dust from etching your paint ? <p> Its almost impossible to prevent the irons to stick on the surface , but it has been proven that inorganic coatings ( such as Cquartz &amp; C1 ) that have self-cleaning effects can reduce the quantity of iron that adheres to the surface . <p> How to remove iron particles from surface ? <p> There are few options . Clay bar is one of them however claying will remove most of the irons by shaving them , which leaves some underneath the surface where it can not reach . Also clay could possibly mar your paint with micro scratches together with the iron it catches . Another option is by oxalic acid solutions . Though it may remove iron you ca n't be sure it is safe on paint , which depends on dilution ( low pH ) , and its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The third option is by Iron X , a pH neutral product , which reacts only with iron particles which it dissolves . IronX contains a specific chemical that reacts aggressively with iron BUT and its big but , this chemical is very unstable if not mixed in the right % , its sensitive to heat as well . This means it can even react with open air and change color to red/purple without any contact with iron ! <p> Why does it change color ? <p> Iron X changes color to red/purple when coming in contact with iron particles , this is due to chemical reaction between the chemicals and iron . However some other products change colors as well . The change in color does not necessarily mean a product is dissolving iron . There are very cheap chemicals that change their character simply by contact with air . <p> Why the bottle is transparent ? <p> We use transparent bottles so the customers can see if color of liquid has reacted , with the metal spring inside the sprayer or even in the open-air contact , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . However with Iron X it is still very strong even if it becomes a pink color . <p> Why we now use special full plastic spray heads ? <p> In the past we faced complains about the changing color inside the bottle . this was due to the metal spring inside the spray head , which most triggers use including the so-called chemical resistant types . These spring are mostly made in China and have rust on them from their creation . That was why we recently started using only plastic springs inside the triggers . This way no more possibility of reaction with any irons until the product is used . The new triggers are marked with small stickers on them , to define from old ones . <p> Will Iron X stain chrome wheels or chrome trims ? <p> No , its completely safe to use on any chrome wheels , trim , or bare aluminum wheels . There is only one condition : Do not let it dry under sun light <p> Will Iron X discolor wheel weights ? <p> Yes , it will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the lead color to green . However light agitation will recover the original color . <p> Will Iron X affect brake calipers ? <p> For most high end calipers it will not affect them however we have heard from customers in the past that Iron X can affect the paint color of low quality acrylic painted calipers . For this reason we advise you to be more careful not to spray on them . <p> Will Iron X remove wax from car paint ? <p> Yes , if its a highly organic oil type it will affect the wax properties . If its a synthetic polymer sealant it wont affect it much . On Cquartz or other inorganic coatings it wo n't affect them at all . In fact it is even recommended for use on them . <p> Does Iron X remove tar spots as well ? <p> No , Iron X reacts only with iron particles . <p> Is Iron X safe to use on 3M films venture-shields ? <p> Yes , there is no problem at all using it on clear bra 's and others . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the chemical used , you can not avoid this . If it does n't  smell so strong it means it has very little effect on iron or is a very diluted or inferior formula . We do advise you to use a facemask and latex ( or Nitrile ) gloves while using Iron X. <p> Why Iron X has low to medium viscosity ? <p> The viscosity was the struggle between the best impact with iron and the best/safest way to easily remove it from the surface . If you make the product too thick will not react well with iron particles due to the thickener additives . If you make it too thin there will only be a short reaction time , which will leave some iron behind . With Iron X we have attempted to find the sweet spot between these two challenges to hit the center of the target with our solution . <p> Can I leave Iron X to dry on the surface ? <p> Yes , you can leave Iron X on the surface to dry , but not under direct sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition to dry . <p> How can I remove iron in a more economical way ? <p> There are few ways . Buy in bigger size containers if you know you are going to use it more in future . Buy the eco refill packs , these save the cost for the plastic bottle and triggers + its weight for delivery . You do n't  need to " soak spray " your car and wheels with Iron X. A light spraying and agitating will do the job as well . Iron X is powerful enough to handle with a few spritz on the surface . Another option is by using a HVLP ( high volume low pressure ) gun together with air pressure you can save much of the liquid and spray the surface well . Use Iron X Snow Soap for maintenance , using it neat on car surface or wheels will be a powerful iron remover with very low consumption however you will need to agitate and leave on the surface to react .

Only use microfiber detergent or liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perfumes . When washing consider a second rinse cycle to remove any remaining detergents if needed . NEVER use fabric softeners or dryer sheets . When drying either hang dry or dry on a very low heat cycle and never leave them in the dryerlong enough to heat up . A dry microfiber that is heated to a certain point melts and becomes a danger to paint . Rinsing your new towels in the washer is always a good habit but also be aware that some colors may bleed onto others if you mix colors during that first wash cycle . After use microfiber should be stored , washed , and kept separate according to their task . In other words you would never use a wheel towel and then mix it with your paint towel . Mixing wax and sealant towels with glass and drying towels are a good way to remove absorbency from or cause streaking with your drying towels . Interior or doorjamb towels will collect sand and particles you would never want in your paint buffing towels so keep those separate as well .

Microfiber towels should only be washed with other microfiber towels . If you wash with other types of fabrics like cotton , etc , the microfiber will retain lint from those fabrics . Wash with Micro-Restore which contains everything you want and nothing you do not . NEVER use fabric softeners or dryer sheets . When drying , dry on a very low heat cycle and never leave them in the dryerlong enough to overheat . A dry microfiber that is heated to a certain point melts and becomes a danger to paint . Rinsing your new towels in the washer is always a good habit but also be aware that some colors may bleed onto others if you mix colors during that first wash cycle . After use microfiber should be stored , washed , and kept separate according to their task . In other words you would never use a wheel towel and then mix it with your paint towel . Mixing wax and sealant towels with glass and drying towels are a good way to remove absorbency from or cause streaking with your drying towels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never want in your paint buffing towels so keep those separate as well just to be safe . <p> Points to Review : <p> All microfiber should be washed once before use to remove any loose fiber from the towel . <p> Bold or bright colors should be washed separate the first time to avoid color exchange .

I like to have a dedicated Iron X sponge but that is n't necessary . <h> Iron X Facts and Frequently Asked Questions : <p> How iron particles appear on your car surface and where ? <p> Iron particles are all around us , and ofcourse on our cars after traveling through the environment . They can be made from your car braking , driving near other cars , big trucks , train rails , industrial zones etc . They adhere to the car surface and once they " stick " to your paint due to there sharp edges together with sunshine they start to bake into the soft car paint layer where they oxidize and rust . <p> How to prevent iron dust from etching your paint ? <p> Its almost impossible to prevent the irons to stick on the surface , but it has been proven that inorganic coatings ( such as Cquartz &amp; C1 ) that have self-cleaning effects can reduce the quantity of iron that adheres to the surface . <p> How to remove iron particles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of them however claying will remove most of the irons by shaving them , which leaves some underneath the surface where it can not reach . Also clay could possibly mar your paint with micro scratches together with the iron it catches . Another option is by oxalic acid solutions . Though it may remove iron you ca n't be sure it is safe on paint , which depends on dilution ( low pH ) , and its not safe to use for your own health and environment . The third option is by Iron X , a pH neutral product , which reacts only with iron particles which it dissolves . <p> Why it changes its color ? <p> Iron X changes color to red/purple when coming in contact with iron particles , this is due to chemical reaction between the chemicals and iron . However some other products change colors as well . The change in color does not necessarily mean a product is dissolving iron . There are very cheap chemicals that change their character simply by contact with air . <p> Why we now use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we faced complains about the changing color inside the bottle . this was due to the metal spring inside the spray head , which most triggers use including the so-called chemical resistant types . These spring are mostly made in China and have rust on them from their creation . That is why we use only plastic springs inside these triggers . This way no more possibility of reaction with any irons until the product is used . <p> Will Iron X stain chrome wheels or chrome trims ? <p> No , its completely safe to use on any chrome wheels , trim , or bare aluminum wheels . There is only one condition : Do not let it dry under sun light <p> Will Iron X discolor wheel weights ? <p> Yes , it will . Wheel weights are made from lead , Iron X will change the lead color to green . However light agitation will recover the original color . <p> Will Iron X affect brake calipers ? <p> For most high end calipers it will not affect them however we have heard from customers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low quality acrylic painted calipers . For this reason we advise you to be more careful not to spray on them . <p> Will Iron X remove wax from car paint ? <p> Yes , if its a highly organic oil type it will affect the wax properties . If its a synthetic polymer sealant it wont affect it much . On Cquartz or other inorganic coatings it wo n't affect them at all . In fact it is even recommended for use on them .

But this is not simply a polish <p> In less than the time you take to polish a car with conventional products , CarPro Essence is capable of removing swirls , building your clear coat thicker , leaving higher gloss , and laying down a semi-permanent coat of protection ! Oh and it wipes off like a dream ! <p> Incredibly Essence also leaves a perfectly smooth , deep , reflective , primed layer to build on with CQuartz or Reload ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever and bonds together seamlessly , forming a shell of Extreme Gloss and protection ! <p> If your using Essence by machine and you wait until the vehicle is finished then you can apply Reload or CQuartz after you finish the vehicle starting in the same direction you polished . If you want to be ultra safe you can still Eraser but in our testings to date we have not seen any failure when we skipped Eraser . <p> If your using Essence by hand then we recommend you use Eraser before coating . <p> 3 - How long does CarPro Essence last ? <p> We expect 1 year on its own BUT we recommend applying reload or CQuartz over top for the much better hydrophobics and dirt resistance . This will provide 115+ Degree contact angle instead of 90 deg contact angle ( not so good ) with Essence alone . <p> 4 - So , I can use Essence with CQuartz ? <p> Yes , any CQuartz coating and any of our CarPro Nano sealants like Reload it will work great . <p> 5 - How does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CQuartz ? <p> It bonds to the paint , the CQuartz bonds to it and merges . The SiO2/resin in it are heat activated by the machine polishing process . If using by hand or in very cold temps you should Eraser the vehicle before coating . <p> 6 - So , if this has SiO2 quartz protection inside it why are you guys telling me to top it with Reload or CQuartz ? <p> Great question ! The protection is there as we stated BUT the contact angle of the water beads and the dirt repellency is not very good / not on par with Reload or CQuartz . <p> 7 - Is CarPro Essence super easy to use ? <p> Yes , usually extremely easy ! It is but there are always other variables . As always there can be a little learning curve on some paints . IF you run into a paint where it seems to stick a bit then you need to change your pad type and or your machine speed , arm speed , or pressure . <p> On very soft paints especially ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following method : Use a microfiber padSpread super fast on speed 1Raise speed to about 3-4 depending on machineUsing minimal pressure ( about a pound or so + weight of machine ) use VERY slow arm movement across the section and go only one single pass . <p> Finally for some paints , consider faster arm movement with half bites into the section , backing up , and then moving forward to avoid any sticking of product . <p> 8 - What if I leave a spot that seems like the Essence stuck to it ? <p> Simply apply a dot of Essence on the area , run over it with fast arm speed , and immediately wipe off the residue . It may simply wipe off with a suede and a dot of Essence as well . <p> 9 - When should I wipe off the residue ? <p> On some paints you could actually leave it there an hour and it is still super easy to wipe off . On soft or porous paints we recommend wiping off immediately after each section . <p> 10 - What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid them becoming " crispy " with SiO2 ? <p> Yes , clean your pads very well with APC/water after use . During use it does n't  harden due to the repeated saturation of more Essence on the pad . <p> 11 - What about my microfiber wiping towels ? <p> Yes , wash your towels well or soak them after use if you cant place them in the washer soon after . <p> 12 - So what are the biggest benefits to using CarPro Essence ? <p> There are a LOT of applications and benefits where Essence excels beyond anything previously available . Gloss on another levelHours saved per vehicleEase of finishing even the most difficult paintsThickening of the coating ( Essence builds a glossy and reflective quartz coat ) which bonds with the paint and merges with CQuartz or Reload if we apply it after Essence.PPF We all know its not the best looking means of protection so this was a really cool find ppf and clear bras LOVE CarPro Essence ! The clarity and gloss of ppf is VERY visibly enhanced when Essence is used on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essence ? How large are the abrasives ? <p> Essence uses the same abrasives from Reflect but less of them . However , due to the viscosity and balance of a number of other ingredients we do see an unexpected amount of cut on some paints ( especially when paired with a Megs microfiber cutting pad ) <p> 14 - How does this work ? Is this some kind of marketing nonsense ? <p> No , thanks for your patience as we launched this ! Answers to any questions will be answered in this thread . Feel free to post any others you have ! <p> 15 - Can I use CarPro Essence without compounding first ? <p> That depends Certainly you can and certainly it will produce excellent gloss . As for durability this would be theoretically ill-advised . On many paints it will also cut FAR more than you can imagine in concert with a Meguiars microfiber cutting pad . As far as how durable it will be and what your goal is you should compound first to remove oxidation and scratches . <p> In other words if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you want to have long term protection then you SHOULD compound first . As for the finish and deeper swirls that is what test sections are for when choosing if Essence provides the cut you desire . <p> 16 - What about Essence topped with CarPro Hydro2 ? Or Hydrofoam ? ! <p> Yes , in this case I would advise that you wait until the vehicles next visit or anytime after 5 days to apply Hydro2 or wash with Hydrofoam . In my experience using Essence and then maintaining with CarPro Hydrofoam = Magic <p> 17 - How long until it can get wet ? <p> 1 hour before you should allow release into water . BUT remember we are applying Reload or CQuartz over the top so if CQuartz is the choice for topping then CQuartz will still need its cure time to avoid water spots . <p> 18 - If my car already is in good condition ... recent decon , polishing , and now has wax on it can I simply use Essence ? Or do I need to strip the existing protection first ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many variables - with some wax , sealants , and the right pad and pad cleaning etc it would be fine BUT I would n't risk it . I would kill the wax off well with strong iron X Snow soap cleaning , then proceed . We may update this after we have enough field testing to prove otherwise . <p> 19 - What is the shelf life expectancy ? <p> 1 Year <p> 20 - Should I strip existing protection if paint is in great shape to apply Essence ? <p> Yes , I would strip the wax or sealant as a minimum prep step . <p> 21 - How much should I apply ? like a polish ... or sparingly like a coating ? <p> More like a polish . For using the CarPro Gloss pad we apply sparingly for most paints . With Microfiber Pad we use more . <p> 22 - How far will the 5oz bottle go ? <p> 2-5 cars depending on the goal , the paint , the pad , and more <p> 23 - Can Essence be used as sort of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has CQuartz and/or Reload on it , then follow with CQuartz and/or Reload again ? <p> Yes , you can use to " heal " a damaged existing CQuartz coating . Keep in mind that its possible to damage some the existing CQuartz hydrophobic surface when you " heal " any micro marring with Essence but if you are coating again over the top then it should be a moot point . If you are not coating again over the top then you are trading - fixing the light marring for a less hydrophobic and dirt repellant surface . <p> 24 - Does this have to be used with CQuartz or Reload or can I use something else as a LSP or do I even need to worry about using a LSP ? <p> We believe you can use a lot of different lsp that work well with this . We have n't tested others products with it so not positive the results but that is our estimate . I would wait a bare minimum of an hour if applying a sealant or wax with high solvent content in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car to see if an hour is enough .

It will work with any foam pad really BUT depending on the paint you may have more or less luck with different pads .

Our friends at KXK Dynamics certainly were ... so they decided to do something about it ! Now YOU can punch out your very own 1 3/8 " , 2 " , and 2 3/4 " pads in minutes from the comfort of your own shop ! The XP Pad punch series of products furthers the #1 goal of KXK Dynamics to place the power squarely in YOUR hands to increase the efficiency and profitability of your business ! <p> When KXK approached me with their early prototype and the question of : " Would you be interested in introducing this product to the industry ? " My first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately by a moment of conflict within ... Would I lose sales on the smaller pads we currently offer ? Maybe ...

Will this product make many of my customers happy ? Oh yes ! Is there a product currently available in our industry that accomplishes what this does ? No ! The list goes on but you get the point ... And here we are today ! <p> The XP-3 can easily create ( 3 ) pads out of a single 6 " pad while still leaving room for ( 3 ) 1 " pads from its little brother ( the XP-1 ) ! In other words ... for every pad you turn into " swiss cheese " to create your 6 new pads you save $24 ! <p> The 2 3/4 " pads produced by the XP-3 will fit any 2 1/2 " to 2 3/4 " backing plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible machines day in and day out .... so for your " RUPES Mini " backing plate they came up with an ingenious solution ... Punch it ! ( See Tip 3 at bottom ) <p> But ... why not make the XP-3 cut a true 3 " pad in the first place ? This decision was based almost entirely on one simple but CRUCIAL variable ... A 3 " diameter punch would yield only ( 2 ) 3 " pads from a 6 " Megs pad . By creating a slightly smaller punch size for the XP-3 you are able to increase your yield of 3 " pads by 33% and lower product costs even further ! <p> For those of you that do not use 3 " pads very often this tool may not be a necessity ... For every one else its a " no brainer " ! <p> The choice ... is simple mathematics .

The XP-3 punch size was controlled by one single variable . The pad is faced " velcro side " DOWN and the punch centered directly over it . Then it is punched in the same manner as a pad .

Microfiber towels should only be washed with other microfiber towels . If you wash with other types of fabrics like cotton , etc , the microfiber will retain lint from those fabrics .

NEVER use fabric softeners or dryer sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle and never leave them in the dryerlong enough to overheat . A dry microfiber that is heated to a certain point melts and becomes a danger to paint . Rinsing your new towels in the washer is always a good habit but also be aware that some colors may bleed onto others if you mix colors during that first wash cycle . After use microfiber should be stored , washed , and kept separate according to their task . In other words you would never use a wheel towel and then mix it with your paint towel . Mixing wax and sealant towels with glass and drying towels are a good way to remove absorbency from or cause streaking with your drying towels . Interior or doorjamb towels will collect sand and particles you would never want in your paint buffing towels so keep those separate as well just to be safe . <p> Points to Review : <p> All microfiber should be washed once before use to remove any loose fiber from the towel . <p> Bold or bright colors should be washed seperate the first time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few washes minimum as there is always a chance for color bleeding between distinctly different Microfiber towel colors

When exposed to UV light in the sub 400 range , TiO2 becomes a photo catalyst oxidizer ( PCO ) as well which creates hydroxyl radicals and super-oxide ions which are two times stronger disinfectants than chlorine and 1.5 times stronger a disinfectant than ozone . <p> After applied , does it produce any odor ? <p> No , it does not have any odor . If applied to surfaces with for instance tobacco odors , those odors will go away . <p> Does this So2Pure liquidhave a shelf life ? <p> Basically , there is no shelf life . This solution should be stored in a dark , cool environment long term however . <p> After it is applied , how long does it last ? <p> The Titanium crystals in So2Pure liquid form bonds that are semi-permanent . In case of some materials that may undergo a physical peeling off by some force ( such as carpets , mats , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every 6 months . <p> Does So2Pure liquidcause any fabric discoloration or any streaking effects on solid surfaces ? <p> So2Pure liquid can be applied to fabrics , curtains , carpets , woods , tiles , ceramics , glass , even metal and painted surfaces . If the surface is exposed to direct sunlight , do not apply to black or very dark colored surfaces as the oxidation process can remove some pigments from surfaces . Indoor light is not strong enough to cause this oxidative reaction on fabrics and surfaces however . When spraying any surface with So2Pure liquid , it is always advisable to spray a small area first ( test area ) then allow to dry to make sure the solution does not react with the surface . Once you are confident that the fabric or material can safely be treated , spray the surface until it is completely moistened then wipe off with any type of MF to work the So2Pure liquid into the fabric or other . Allow the area to completely dry . <p> Exactly what types of odors will So2Pure liquideliminate ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as treated surfaces become resistant to microorganisms , mold , bacteria , viruses , smoke , odors , etc . It removes odors from the air when a treated surface is exposed to certain light thus creating the photocatalytic oxidative superoxide ion and hydroxyl effect . <p> Does it work in cold environments such as freezers ? Yes . Microbes that come in contact with a treated surface will cease to exist . <p> Does So2Pure liquid get rid of cigarette odors from tar and nicotine that have penetrated surfaces ? <p> Yes . If a second hand smoke contaminated surface ( second hand smoke is known to have over 400 known cancer causing chemicals ) is treated with TiO2 PCO Solution , the odor will soon disappear . However , the discoloration caused by second hand smoke does not disappear . It is therefore advisable to first wash smoke contaminated surfaces that show discoloration before treatment . <p> How does the intensity of light effect the ability of this Nano TiO2 liquid to create friendly oxidizers which purify the air ? <p> As a characteristic of titanium dioxide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ultraviolet rays of 400nm range or lower . It is more affected by the intensity of the ultraviolet rays rather than the intensity of light itself . However , any air pollution , VOC , or odor that comes in contact with a surface treated with So2Pure liquid will become oxidized.

Wash with Micro-Restore , which contains everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use fabric softeners or dryer sheets . When drying , dry on a very low heat cycle and never leave them in the dryer long enough to overheat . A dry microfiber that is heated to a certain point melts and becomes a danger to paint . Rinsing your new towels in the washer is always a good habit but also be aware that some colors may bleed onto others if you mix colors during that first wash cycle . After use microfiber should be stored , washed , and kept separate according to their task . In other words you would never use a wheel towel and then mix it with your paint towel . Mixing wax and sealant towels with glass and drying towels are a good way to remove absorbency from or cause streaking with your drying towels .

Additionally , Microfiber Madness will double the donation at the end of this event in December 2016 . That means , ( for example ) if we sell 100 shirts then we create a donation of $650.00 , so it becomes $1300.00 total provided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected until December 2016 and will be donated at Christmas . Microfiber Madness decided to put that money towards the charity organization called " Make a wish foundation " . It has its roots in the USA and has offices in nearly every country in the world . The idea behind " Make A Wish " is , to make wishes come true for children with life-threatening medical conditions . If one of these children dreams for example of a meet &amp; greet with its favorite athlete or superstar , Make A Wish tries to make this dream come true . Or if a child has a wish of a new computer , they try to make it happen ! It is proven , that this it not only about making a wish come true ! The psychologic benefits are huge , because when wishes came true , often children and even the family gain new strength to deal with the situation and do n't  lose the will to fight ! " Make A Wish " is a 100% non-profit organization , working only with donations , so we decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is a ZERO profit item and we are thrilled to be a part of it at Sky 's the Limit Car Care !

The total thickness is only 3/8 " , which conforms to the workability needs of the users of modern polishers , while the foam interface , constructed of the highest rated open cell foam , allows for working large flat areas as well as contours . <p> With the innovation and advent ( by RUPES ) of long throw polishers , pads must endure an entirely new level of energy as they are thrown in two directions simultaneously at speeds and distances the pads of the past did not have to endure . Because of these factors , Buff &amp; Shine chose to use the highest rated heat-resistant and chemical-resistant adhesives they could acquire . After a heavy polishing session , simply wash them and they 're ready to use again ! <h> Features : <p> Versatile : From heavy cut to polish stage possible with this single pad type 
@@7516009 @716009/ <h> CarPro ECH2O Concentrate 17oz. ( 500ml ) <p> EcH2o is an entirely new waterless cleanser and gloss-enhancer built on 2 years of research and development by CarPro Chemicals ! EcH2o was designed to work in harmony with ceramic coatings and even provides easy cleaning of non-coated or waxed surfaces ! Based on a SiO2 hybrid framework and an eco-friendly organic lubricant solution , EcH2o safely cleans and glosses a variety of exterior vehicle surfaces with ease ! <p> Paint and chrome take on an entirely new level of gloss and reflection with this incredible formula and better yet it is easy to use even in extreme heat and direct sun on painted surfaces ! Our solution to providing a swirl free and eco friendly waterless experience is a blend of proprietary lifting agents combined with natural organic extracts and lubricants . <p> The secret to the safe cleansing abilities provided by EcH2o is a combination of its modified high gloss SiO2 component and its innate cleansing abilities , which easily removes dust and light dirt whilst leaving behind a wet , glass-like surface ! The finish left by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CarPro SiO2 sealants and CQuartz coatings throughout the years ! <p> In conjunction with a quality microfiber towel , the lubricants aid in safely removing the larger particles from the surface while the remnants of the EcH2o solution become an active cleaner across the surface and begin to loosen any particulates that were left behind . Before the final step ( noted in the product directions ) the solution may dry to a fine haze indicating it is ready to wipe off any remaining product effortlessly ! <p> No , the organic lubricants in Ech2o are GREAT for aiding in safe quick detailing but lubricants can hinder the bonding of CQuartz to the surface . For that purpose , stick with Eraser for a wipe-down solution . That is what Eraser was designed for . <p> Can I use Ech2o for wiping down a car that I just coated ? <p> That depends on your definition of " Just " . Ech2o has very effective cleaners in it so we do NOT want to introduce a cleaning solution to a ceramic coating that is STILL undergoing a very complex curing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / wiping off dust then yes . In that case dilute Ech2O 1:25 and gently remove any dust . <p> How do I use it ? <p> As a high QD dilution Spray and wipe . <p> For waterless - take a look at the product videos tab . <p> Why do you have a range of dilutions mentioned ? <p> There are a lot of variables in detailing . Level of dust and dirt , temperature , humidity , preference , technique , and existing surface protection are just a few of the variables . In general we would recommend you start with 1:15 for waterless wash and 1:25 for Quick Detailer . <p> Can I use Ech2O on Chrome ? <p> Oh Yes ! It leaves the chrome incredibly clean , slick , and glossy ! <p> Can I use Ech2O on Glass ? <p> Yes , it works excellent ! <p> Can I use Ech2O on interiors ? <p> You can use Ech2O on some interior surfaces but we would recommend using CarPro Inside for most interior surfaces !

Microfiber towels should only be washed with other microfiber towels . If you wash with other types of fabrics like cotton , etc , the microfiber will retain lint from those fabrics . Wash with Micro-Restore which contains everything you want and nothing you do not . NEVER use fabric softeners or dryer sheets . When drying either hang dry or dry on a very low heat cycle and never leave them in the dryerlong enough to heat up . A dry microfiber that is heated to a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your new towels in the washer is always a good habit but also be aware that some colors may bleed onto others if you mix colors during that first wash cycle . After use microfiber should be stored , washed , and kept separate according to their task . In other words you would never use a wheel towel and then mix it with your paint towel . Mixing wax and sealant towels with glass and drying towels are a good way to remove absorbency from or cause streaking with your drying towels . Interior or doorjamb towels will collect sand and particles you would never want in your paint buffing towels so keep those separate as well just to be safe
