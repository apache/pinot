@@98430850 @2630850/ <h> Are you properly prepared to invest in a pre-construction condominium ? <p> The good news about investing in pre-construction condos versus resale condos is that , for a change , time is now on your side . <p> When buying a pre-construction condo you can use the benefit of time by quickly grabbing something that immediately gets your attention , then taking extra time to later confirm your decision , without the risk of losing any money or the unit you have selected . <p> In these scenarios , you have a legally protected time based rescission period ( 10-day cooling off period ) to consider and finalize your decision . It starts when you sign and submit the initial purchase agreement . This means that you can tie up a unit you like , and then really start analyzing the details to determine if it 's the right purchase for your needs. - During the 10-day period , if you change your mind for any reason the developer will simply release you from your contract , no strings attached and no fees incurred . <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does n't mean you should n't be properly prepared before you start making selections . There are a lot of variables that should be considered to help you make both a great selection and buying decision . <p> Here are some points you should be considering ahead of time ; <p> Which locations interest you ? Do some initial online research . Here is an example of a search using com , for new condos priced between $500,000 $600,000 , in the Yonge and Eglinton area of Toronto . <p> Start thinking about the type of condo project you like . Are you going with a luxury project , or do you have a tight budget and you just want to get into the market with a small , functional condo unit ? <p> Consider the length of your condo investment . Are you planning on assigning your contract to someone else before the project is registered or are you buying so that you can rent it longer term and benefit from property appreciation ? <p> Look into quality real estate representatives to represent you . Selectively chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Platinum Agents can get you the Platinum or VIP access to units before the project opens to the public , when pricing is lowest and there is much more available selection . <p> Have a chat with a mortgage broker so that you can get a feel for what your condo budget should be . There 's no point in buying a condo for $600,000 when you will only qualify for a mortgage to buy a $450,000 condo . <p> Start reading up on the pre-construction condo buying process . It really is different from buying resale properties ( not in a bad way , just different ) , with its own procedures and vernacular . <p> Following through on these items should not only help you with making a decision , it should help you in making a great real estate investment choice .

It 's brand new with a fresh coat of paint , never before used appliances , and the latest infrastructure . <h> How can anything go wrong ! <p> Well the truth of the matter is sometimes things do . Without Tarion Warranty , a few hiccups like retouching the walls or an unexpected leak , can cost you a lot of money that you never expected and might not have after just purchasing . <p> Created in 1976 , Tarion is warranty coverage for homeowners on new condominiums and freeholds . It is a contract between purchasers and builders where the primary purpose is to protect homeowners . This warranty covers homeowners up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states their purpose is to : <p> Tarion assists homeowners with the transition into their new home and serves in , Ontario 's public interest by enhancing fairness and building confidence in the new home buying experience ' . <h> If your Builder has Tarion Warranty , you can be protected from the following : <p> -Unsuitable construction for habitation -Water penetration through basement or foundation walls -Defects in the electrical , plumbing , and other systems -Major Structural Defects Etc . <p> However , there are a lot of restrictions and limitations within the warranty . Tarion is extremely strict and will not accept any claim received after the deadline . Many homeowners fail to recall guidelines and as a result can not claim deficiencies found in their homes ( even if it 's the builder 's fault ) . <p> To ensure you are taking full advantage of Tarion and its coverage , below is some key information you should know . <h> Before you move in : Pre-Delivery Inspection or PDI <p> The PDI is generally done 1-2 weeks prior to closing and is a crucial step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk through is the first time you will see your home in its finished state . You will need to pay special attention and report any items that are damaged , missing , incomplete and not operating in good condition on the PDI form . Small damages like chipped paint to larger problems such as malfunctioning fixtures need to be reported immediately . <p> It is critical not to skip this step ; if you report a deficiency after your PDI , the damages may not be covered and the repairs will be at your own cost . For example , if you report chipped paint after moving in , Tarion can dispute that the process of moving in as a plausible cause . <h> After you move in : Warranty Claims <p> In your first year of moving in , you have two opportunities to file a warranty claim : a 30-Day Form can be submitted during the first 30 days of occupancy and a Year-End Form during the last 30 days of your first year 's possession . Both forms should report any unresolved items from your PDI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is important to remember that you can not submit multiple forms for your 30-day and Year-End form . Only the first form submitted will be accepted , so it is crucial to ensure all the information on the form is noted and correct . <p> In your second year of possession , Tarion will cover any items listed under the Two-Year or Major Structural Defect warranty and thankfully , you can submit more than one form ! However , after your second year of occupancy , Tarion will only cover major structural defects up to the end of your seventh year of possession . Homeowners need to note that every warranty form covers different items . For example , a deficiency you discover in your second year of occupancy may not be covered under the Two-Year warranty but may have been under the 30-Day or Year-End warranty . <p> Patience is a virtue when dealing with Tarion . After a warranty claim form is submitted it can take up to 120 days for it to be fixed or resolved . If the problem is still not fixed within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarion directly and request a conciliation inspection . REMEMBER IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR CLAIMS . If a conciliation inspection is not requested within the 30 days , the claim will be considered resolved . Dealing with Tarion can be a headache but looking at damaged items is a bigger eyesore . You want your new condominium to be a good investment and the last thing you want to deal with as a homeowner , is to pay out of your own pocket for pre-existing damages . <h> Always Research the Builder <p> It is so important to look into the builder 's warranties and reputation of dealing with major problems so you can rest assured that your new purchase will be in good hands . Reliable builders like Tridel always make sure their residents are taken care of and so a Tridel Condo has Tarion Warranty on every suite . <p> Be proactive and do your research first .

It gives the investor a stable , accurate forecast on mortgage payments over the term of their loan as well as a clear understanding of the impact of those payments on cash flow and ROI . The downside is that the fixed rates are usually higher , and if the bank rates trend downward , there is no way to get out of a fixed rate , in order to benefit from that down trend during the term of the initial financing . <p> Many real estate investors often think of the difference between fixed and variable rates almost as a type of insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The rationale for using a variable rate is also straightforward .

It 's important you understand all the tax issues and benefits that are available to you as an investor . <p> Let 's walk through an example of a typical first time condo investor . <p> Samantha lives in Toronto and wants to invest in a condo . She plans to purchase a condo for $365,000 , rent it for $1,700 a month for at least three years , and then sell after the value increases . Samantha plans to borrow $200,000 to make this investment . What tax issues are important for her to consider before investing in this condo ? <p> Making the best use of tax deductions <p> Following Canada Revenue Agency ( CRA ) rules , if you own a rental property , any net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . Rental income is usually reported on a calendar-year basis . Samantha will have a gross rental income of 12 x $1,700 = $20,400 . Samantha can use deductions to reduce that income and minimize the tax burden . <p> All reasonable expenses incurred in operating the property can be deducted . This can include the insurance cost , property taxes , condo fees , mortgage interest , electricity , heat , repairs and even advertising for tenants . If Samantha borrows money to make the down payment on the rental property , interest on that loan is also deductible . <p> Samantha may also be able to claim depreciation , also called capital cost allowance ( CCA ) , which is normally 4% for residential property . With respect to claiming CCA , the tax implications for Samantha are considerably complicated and for the purpose of simplicity will not be considered for the time being . More information on this topic can be found here . <p> The CRA allows Samantha to classify certain expenses like repair and improvements into two categories : current or capital expenses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting improvement ) of her property or improve it beyond its original condition are usually capital expenses . An expense considered to recur more often is usually considered a current expense . Current expenses can be used as a deduction against rental income , but capital expenses are added to the original cost of the property for consideration when the property is sold . <p> Since this will be Samantha 's only rental property , she will be allowed to deduct motor vehicle expenses assuming that her rental property is in the general area in which she lives , she personally does part ( or all ) of the repairs and maintenance to the property , and she uses her vehicle to transport tools and materials to the property . <p> Creating the tax table and a simple ROI table <p> To highlight how this actually works while keeping things simple , the table below shows how Samantha can deduct reasonable expenses to minimize her annual tax due on her condo rental . <p> Samantha 's statement of real estate rental : <p> Gross rental income from condo <p> $20,400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest ( first year ) <p> -$7,400 <p> Less condo fees ( $400 monthly ) <p> -$4,800 <p> Less property tax <p> -$2,700 <p> Less legal and accounting fees <p> -$1,000 <p> Less repair to broken closet door , new paint <p> -$400 <p> Less condo insurance <p> -$350 <p> Less motor vehicle expenses <p> -$275 <p> Less advertising for tenants <p> -$150 <p> Net rental income from condo <p> $3,325 <p> The net rental income figure of $3,325 would be taxed at Samantha 's marginal tax rate . The resulting tax paid is much less than would be the case if Samantha did not make effective use of deductions to minimize her tax liability . For example , not making use of available deductions greatly affects Samantha 's effective return on income ( ROI ) . As a general tax tip , Samantha should keep an accurate record of all expenses to make tax time something to look forward to ! <p> Return on income ( ROI ) outcomes : <p> Net rental income <p> Tax paid on rental income* <p> No deductions <p> $20,400 <p> $8,160 <p> Reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax rate <p> Samantha sees that by using available deductions she can keep $6,830 ( $8,160-$1,330 ) that would have otherwise been paid to the government . <p> The key thing to consider here is that there are a number of deductions that are unique to Samantha and that another investor most likely has different tax circumstances and deductions available . In any case , professional advice from accountants and lawyers with investment real estate experience should never be overlooked . <p> The bottom line is this : Strategic investors know and understand that not having a clear tax strategy can be very risky . Samantha should be clear about having a good long term tax strategy in place to avoid serious tax repercussions . It 's highly advisable to consult with a tax specialist when creating a tax strategy . Samantha should have an open dialogue with her accountant to set a clear mandate .

@@98430887 @2630887/ <h> The One Condos Sam Mizrahi Tells Us All the Luxurious Details <h> " Are the floor plans in The One Condos still as customizable as they were when we discussed last time ? " <p> 100% . One of the big interesting features of this building is your ability to customize . Luxury to me is measured in units of one . That to me is luxury . Regardless of the scale . It does n't matter if I 'm building a 12 storey like 181 Davenport or 9 like 133 or 128 Hazelton , or we 're building the super tall super structure of what 1 Bloor will be , it 's still going to be a super high end luxury building because we 're measuring it in units of one where you as a home owner will come and be able to custom design your units to exactly the wishes that you want . You want to move things around no problem . There 's no limits of what you can do because of the structural engineering that we 've done in this building . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> " That 's where in a lot of buildings the customization stops . " <p> Correct and we 've proven that . If you look at 133 or 128 Hazelton . Every purchaser that went in there , there 's not 2 units that are the same , and the home owners had absolute discretion on where they wanted their kitchens , where they wanted their bathrooms and there 's no limits to it because we 've done that already in 2 buildings that are done so we know what we 're doing we know how to engineer it . <h> " Does that bring huge construction headaches ? " <p> You know everyone says that and maybe the answer is yes but the reality is I do n't know any better because I came from custom home building where it was normal to me . So maybe I got acclimatized to it , so for me its just my normal where as for everybody else , it might be such a headache or a nightmare but for us we did n't know any better . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other way . The way I look at it , - no is not an option . Let 's get it done . - If we ca n't figure out how to engineer something like this we should n't be in the business of doing it . <h> " Where will the units fall in terms of price point ? Is it similar to what we discussed last time ? " <p> The market is very different . I think you 're going to see price point starting at $1200 a square foot &amp; up from there depending on the height &amp; view . <h> " Are these going to be smart units ? " <p> Absolutely . These are going to be state of the art smart homes . All the lasts features and technology in them . The apps will work into your IOS system and into your phone . <h> " So we know this building is different from typical condos , what special features does it have ? " <p> There are so many features in this building that set them apart but a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the build , construction , finishing details that we 're putting in , this is our flagship in terms of finishing details , the luxury , and the quality of the suites . But if we go into the functionality the building has , the amenity space is going to have a rooftop for the penthouse and the sub penthouse . There 're going to have sky gardens , these are going to be backyards in the sky at basically 1005 feet . With swimming pools , private pools , private outdoor fireplaces , winter gardens that are very unique that have never been done before . On the 10th floor there 's a pool deck overlooking Yonge &amp; Bloor which is going to be open 365 days of the year so it 's heated , full snowmelt , open swimming pool with full amenities areas that you can use in January . The pool will be at 100 degrees . It 's creating an environment that 's never been seen before in Toronto in terms of living . <p> We 're going to have a connection to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Toronto Pearson airport to this building without ever being outside , using the new LRT &amp; everything else going in , so that 's very unique . <p> Full valet for cars , 24 hour concierge , and security . The building is going to have 2 full floors of amenities . From screening rooms to full functioning kitchens and entertainment spaces basically to a state of the art gym , spinning studios , Pilates , high definition golf to billiard to ping pong to sports area for anything you want to do . We sort of took a magic wand and asked for a wish list from purchasers of what they 'd want to see in the building and we incorporated it . <p> The One Condos also gives the ability to go underground and walk into Holt Renfrew or Hudson Bay or anything else . We 're building a sleeve that will connect to future developments in the south . These are all things that the building 's not only built for today but built for the next 100 years of how we see the city growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and transportation and so forth . <p> And on top of that , one of the other unique features is the retail that 's connected with the residential here in the building . This is going to completely reshape and transform high street retail on Bloor St W. We have a global flagship anchor tenant coming in that 's building a flagship unlike anything that has ever been seen in Canada or North America . There 's very limited number of super flagships that 's being built globally and we are one of the very few . <h> " You ca n't tell us the tenants ! " <p> The anchor tenants are going to do the announcements themselves ! We 're probably 90 120 days away . I think the city and the country is going to be very proud of what 's going to be put there . We 've spent a lot of time specifically engineering for our anchors . We 've actually reversed engineered the building for that in order to have uncontaminated retail space . <h> " What 's the parking like ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valet and we 're doing that for a number of reasons primarily security for the building . We want to control all vehicles any deliveries and cars . As a result we have to inspect and we park it , there 's no one who can self-park . Parking maintenance is built into the maintenance fees if you require a parking spot . <h> " Considering your interested buyers , it 's likely that these owners may have multiple vehicles . " <p> There 's a large number that will have cars and a large number who wont have cars , who are going to be taking the TTC connection because of the fact that we 're connected . Anybody that wants a parking spot will have the availability and of course they 'll have full access . We 're putting stackers in so that each parking spot becomes two . That 's another reason why you ca n't self-park . <h> " Will there be restaurants and nightlife right in the building ? " <p> Yes . Absolutely . We have an incredible hospitality entertainment anchor that 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of an international world class high street of tenant . It 's going to be a mix of restaurants . 6 different ones along with a lobby bar and lounge area . There will be outdoor space as well for entertainment and dining with a rooftop terrace and a patio that 'll be about 41 meters up overlooking the city . <p> It 's going to be something that Toronto has not seen yet . <h> " You 've been building in Yorkville for a long time , how have you seen Yorkville progress in the last 10 years and how do you think The One is going to affect it ? " <p> The neighbourhood has matured and really become more and more what I would call an international neighbourhood in terms of its presence over what I 've seen in the last ten years . And I think The One is going to be a further catalyst and inspire others to do more of this type of development in the city where we 're looking at it not from a locality or perspective of the neighbourhood but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international view . And- with Toronto becoming really a mosaic of different cultures and the diversity that Toronto has become , we 're like the United Nations in terms of diversity now , and with that comes a lot of culture , a lot of history , a lot of sophistication from many different world class city 's that are now coming into Toronto specifically as we see 100,000 migrants in the GTA every year . <p> I think what The One Condos is going to do is it 'll inspire , it 'll be the catalyst for many more of these types of formats of retail and residential and how the symbiotic between residential and the retail come together with the pedestrian experience at grade level . Combine that with what Yorkville is about , it 's really just starting to tie it all together . Were creating a destination similar to what we 've seen in many other buildings around the world like Rockefeller Centre , Empire State Building , Hearst Tower , The Gherkin in London &amp; many others . And I think Toronto is now at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of architecture and buildings that have form &amp; function . 
@@98430888 @2630888/ <h> Renting Out Your Condo In Toronto ? Heres What You Should Know ! <p> Investing in an income property is a great solution to help you pave your way to a mortgage free home . What 's better than making money on a rental while having your mortgage paid off ? Whether you are thinking about renting a new or resale unit , below are a few things you should know before diving into the condo rental game . <p> As a landlord , there are corporation guidelines you and your tenants must follow . For instance , when you find a tenant , you must notify your condo corporation in writing within 20 days of the tenancy starting . You should let the corporation know : your intentions on renting out the unit , your current residing address , amount of rent you will be charging and your tenants ' full legal name/s . The same rule applies when you decide to stop renting out your unit . Again , you will need to inform your condominium corporation within 20 days of the tenancy ending . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after that are considered to be on a month-to-month ' basis . This means that they do n't need to renew their lease but are required to give 60 days notice prior to moving out . Tenants also have many rights in Ontario , with one of them concerning pets . Although you can refuse to rent to someone who owns a pet , you ca n't evict an existing tenant for having a pet . Of course , these are just a few of the many guidelines you and your tenants will need to follow . <p> Renting out your unit and learning all these rules can be a severe headache , but using a real estate professional can often help with the process . Realtors know the in 's and out 's of leases and can lead you through rental guidelines . Although most realtors charge 1 month 's rent for commission , they will assist you in drafting up legal documents , posting your listing on MLS and help you determine a realistic rental price for today 's market . They screen potential tenants and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment letters and references too . CondoNow has an extensive list of qualified and experienced agents , located all over the city . <p> It is important to note that renting out a resale unit compared to a unit in a brand new building is very different . One thing you should be aware of is the HST rebate . In 2010 , the HST rebate was introduced with the purpose of discounting a percentage of the HST for first time homebuyers . This being said , every new condominium sold in Toronto has an HST rebate built into it . <p> With the HST rebate , there are 2 scenarios that can occur . <p> 1 ) The buyer as the end user ' <p> The first scenario is that the buyer purchased the condo with the intention of it being their primary residence . This means that the buyer will be the end-user ' and they are buying it to live in rather than renting it out . If this is the case , the buyer will qualify for the rebate and upon closing the builder will collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your rebate and now you can rest easy . Wrong ! Even after you receive your HST rebate , you still need to abide by ongoing conditions in order for you to avoid having to pay back the amount PLUS interest . If you decide to sell the property or rent it out within a year of occupancy , the rebate must be repaid . It is only after a year of occupancy that there will be no further repercussions made in regards to the rebate . <p> 2 ) Investors <p> This leads us to the second scenario where a buyer or investor is planning to use the unit as a rental property . In this case , the buyer will have to pay the HST prior to closing which will significantly increase the price of the unit . This being said , it may be a better option to wait a year into your occupancy . <p> There are a lot of rules and regulations to think about when renting out a unit in a condominium and even more to consider when renting out a pre-construction unit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many restrictions condominium corporations have for rentals . The intent of this article is not to be read as a form of legal or tax advice , but to be read as an informative piece . Renting out your unit can earn you big bucks and have many benefits but it is always important to consult a Real Estate Lawyer to- avoid any legal complications .

@@98430893 @2630893/ <h> Staying Sane While Investing in Torontos Condos <p> Are you looking to purchase a new condo in Toronto right now ? To put it simply , you are n't  alone . The market is busy these days , and it seems like everyone wants to buy.The shopping process can be- stressful , competitive , and exhausting . Here are four tips to help you keep your sanity while you make your way through Torontos condominium market . <h> 1 . Do Your Research Before You Start Looking for Specific Properties <p> One of the biggest mistakes you can make in shopping for a Toronto condo right now is to start seeing condos and get attached to something without knowing much about the state of the market . The fact is that Torontos condo market is very hot right now . With foreign investors taking a new interest in the market and plenty of locals looking to buy as well , condo prices are high " particularly in hot neighborhoods like Yonge-Eglinton or Casa Loma . In other words , you can start looking at the Toronto Life map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get attached to anything until you 've started researching condo prices in those areas . Depending on what your budget is , it may well render certain parts of the city unaffordable for you . <h> 2 . Figure Out Your Budget <p> Speaking of affordability , its incredibly important when it comes to buying a condo in Toronto . Would you rather try to live beyond your means in one of the citys top neighborhoods or live comfortably in a slightly less sought-after ( but still beautiful ) area ? If you want to keep your sanity , your answer will always be the latter option . Figure out your budget and pair that information with your research on different neighborhoods and prices . If you cant afford housing in Forest Hill , focus your search elsewhere . Youll save time and avoid the heartbreak of having to walk away from a dream condo that just happens to be $50 thousand out of your price range . <h> 3 . Get an Agent <p> Yes , there are a lot of resources online right now that can help you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you find a really good agent . CondoNow has a great resource for viewing and finding an agent that just right for your needs . - A great agent will help you to find a condo that fits your lifestyle , wants and needs , meshes with your budget , and that ( hopefully ) is close to your optimal location . <p> Our CondoNow Agents are more tapped into the market than you can hope to be , and will point you toward new listings , or off-the-beaten-path listings , that you might not have known about otherwise . The Agent you get matched with will also be able to stay in the loop on which properties have bids , which can help you strategize on where to make your offers . Of course , you can still do research on your own and send listings to your agent if you want to see a property , but having an agent to steer the process will keep you from falling behind the rest of the buying crowd . <h> 4 . Avoid Bidding Wars <p> When you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can make an offer and win the bid before any other potential buyers get involved . In a situation where there is another interested buyer , though , be sure to think carefully before you dive into a bidding war . The Toronto condo market is a battlefield right now , which might convince you that you need to double down and up your bid if you get challenged over a dream condo . However , the vibrancy of the market also means that new developments are popping up every month and that you can almost surely find another dream condo if you hold out for a little longer . Weighing these options is important since getting into a bidding war could cause you to make the kind of rash or emotional decisions that push people way over their budgets . <h> Conclusion <p> Ultimately , your budget should be your one unbreakable rule . Knowing what you can afford and keeping that figure in mind at all times will help you zero in on the right properties . Avoid ill-advised decisions , and come out on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallet intact . Just be ready for the possibility of disappointments and false starts : in a market this busy , they are next to inevitable .

And I 've always said that being in Yorkville , being at Yonge &amp; Bloor , I think there 's a huge moral responsibility to do something that 's going to be great with no compromises at The One Condos . <h> " How many people does it take to make a building like this and what other construction facts do you know ? " <p> Over 4,000 people . 6800 metric tons of steel . A LOT of glass . The ground floor is going to be sheets of glass . 3.5 m wide by 34 ft and there 's only 3 places in the world you can manufacture those . It 's very special glass with no iron . <h> " On that note what kind of special challenges do you face constructing a building so tall and such a narrow tight lot in Downtown Toronto ? " <p> It 's a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building and we have employed really the worlds experts who have done these buildings and we 're doing it together . We 're going to be using a jump system to build The One . The jump system is a new form of building , similar to what 432 Park Avenue in Manhattan used &amp; the Burj Khalifa in Dubai where you 've got narrow sites and super high rise structures going in . Basically it 's like Lego . We 're going to be using the latest technology in the jump system methodology . You 've got wind , here 'll be mass dampers going on top . <h> " Speaking of mass dampers I know many places have it as an architectural feature . " <p> Correct . 100% . You start to see it on the crown of the building . This is a state of the art architectural mass damper , again very similar to what was done at 432 Park Avenue recently . <h> " What 's the plan for the Presentation Centre ? " <p> Our presentation gallery is right now under construction . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screens that you swipe onto the walls . It 's going to be something that Canada 's never seen . We 're actually building it with a firm in California . It 's going to be spectacular at the same level of this building . We 're anticipating it being operational before September and we 're having an 18 foot model created by Forster which is just going to be incredible . <p> We have such a huge interest . Over 3,000 on the waiting list right now and I think half the building is going to be gone before the presentation gallery even opens . We 're also going to be using the gallery to do the purchaser selections . Construction for shoring , excavation , and tie backs before September . We 're going to start right away to put our anchor retail tenants in <h> " We believe this is a once in a lifetime opportunity . This is n't going to be a project with huge turn over . People are going to buy these to stay in it . " <p> Well if you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had basically no trades . I took a very large unit for myself and my family . I took one of the penthouse units . I just know there will be nothing else like this in the city . <h> " What 's your management style , how do you employ , and how do you chose your team ? " <p> My own personal style is we hire more on attitude vs. skill . Skill you can get but the attitude of the people in terms of our internal team is the most important to me . Because we 're very passionate about what we do and everybody that is on the team is extremely passionate about what they 're working in and the department they 're working in . We partner with people that not only have a passion but are experts in their fields and have done these types of developments in the past . For them it 's not a job it 's like breathing . You 're very lucky when you find your purpose where you do something that you love . And for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I love doing . The people we partner with and who we employ are as passionate as we are and that comes out in the building at the end of the day . <p> And of course the customer interaction . Even the sub-contractors , they 're so proud to be part of this project . For them it 's their super flagship . We look at employing people that share the same value systems as we do and in the buildings that we 're building . <h> " It 's said you are a perfectionist , and even once repainted an entire garage because you did n't like the colour , tell us the story ? " <p> Oh . Yea , Ha . For me as I said it 's our art . Every detail to me is the most important things . And I look at areas that are maybe not as important as the suite so even the underground garage for example . I think the reference your making is to 133 Hazelton 's garage . I came in and I did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor was finished , and this is after the building had closed , residence had moved in . I just did n't like the way it was looking with the car marks , condition and- colour . So we went ahead and- redid the entire garage for no reason other than I did n't like the colour and how it matched with everything . I wanted it to be perfect . We asked everyone to move their cars out &amp; we sent them a letter and- I said you know I 'm sorry I do n't like the colour , how it 's finished , I do n't like the shade . <h> " That 's not a likely thing for a developer just to spend money on something like that . " <p> Yea the homeowners could n't believe it either , there 's nothing wrong with it and even though a lot of people did n't notice it or did n't really care about it , I cared about it . At the end of the day , the details of the hinges on the door the colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs in the building and even the font on the firehouse cabinet and the colour that label it , to me are as important as the marble , the appliance , the finish of the paint , the carpet , the hardwood floor , the kitchen , the bathroom , details like that to me are as important . They 're the same level . When you bring all those details in concert , that 's when you get a super luxury building . <p> Lytton , the townhouses I did in Lytton . There were only 6 townhouses at the corner of Avenue Rd &amp; Lytton Blvd across from the park and I love it because it 's a timeless classic low-rise single family townhouse complex that we did . It really framed the gateway into Lytton Park . To me it 's a timeless architecture that meets what that whole area is about . It was really the start of my career . We put in incredible detail into those townhomes with internal elevators , rooftop gardens , and created a home on a scale that allowed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same home owners from the beginning are still there . <p> To me that was the beginning for me besides the custom home that Ive done . 133 Hazelton I 'm so proud of , it 's so beautiful . 181 that 's being registered , everyone 's moving in and the construction will be done by the summer . Every development I 've done to me are like my kids . They 're sort of like my children . Each one is sort of part of the same hand but each fingers sort of different . They 're all unique to me . Each one of them I love and each one of them is so different . <p> Again it 's my expression it 's my art collaborating with the community , stakeholders , the city , and creating something that you drive by and its beautiful . These are not trendy buildings , they 're really anchored in very deep rooted values . And they 're very current in design and you know they 've got all the amenities that you want . The One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's funny cause I 'm going from 6 townhomes in Lytton , and everything in between , so I 'm sort of book ending it . <h> " How are you going to measure the success of The One Condos ? " <p> Homeowners . The measure is how the home owners live in those buildings and how they feel . The success of the building is as successful as the home owners that live in them and how happy they are . How it integrates in the community , provides shelter , and- is a place where you make memories . For me that 's what it 's about . How many great memories the home owners have . And the city has . The success will be how the city , the country , the world , views it once it 's complete and if it does everything I believe it 's going to do . <h> " Any final thoughts you want to leave us with ? " <p> I 'm just extremely grateful to be able to do what I 'm doing and to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten it to where we 've gotten it now and to be able to complete this . It 's an incredible honour . We took very big risks and did things that people thought could n't be done . For me could n't was n't a possibility we 're very lucky that we have an incredible team that supported us and I could n't have been happier with the city . You know the city really got behind us and supported this project . For me I 'm just extremely grateful and happy that we can now execute this building . <h> " We hope it 's a huge success . It 's a great opportunity for Toronto as a whole to show the world who we are . " <p> I agree with you . Amen to that . When I was talking to a lot of people this project is bigger than Toronto , it 's bigger than Canada . - When you think about Toronto architecturally the last thing is the CN tower that was built in the 60s . That 's what defined Toronto on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like other cities have . This will be the first of I hope many to introduce Canada to the international architecture stage . To show the world what structurally engineering wise , design wise can be done in Canada . This is the first super tall 300+ m in Canada &amp; I 'm hoping this wo n't be the last . <p> <p> Thank you again Sam Mizrahi for all the insider details . We are so excited to see this project launch and wishing you the very best for The One Condos.

@@98430901 @2630901/ <h> Should I Hire an Agent or Buy Direct from a New Condo Developer <p> When buying a new Condo in Toronto , you have a few options when it comes to whom you use for help . Navigating the real estate markets and its rules and regulations can be difficult . One of the first things you will need to consider is if you should hire a real estate agent or buy directly from the developer . <p> There are benefits and drawbacks to both sides of this equation . A lot depends on the development you are buying , your level of experience and the experience of the agent or builder representative you choose . <p> Here are a few things you should consider when making this decision : <p> Who has the good connections ? Experienced real estate agents will be invited to all the VIP Condo Sales and community events , staying well aware and up-to-date on the latest projects . Plus , they will have relationships with builders and developers , which could lead to negotiated agreements that are beneficial to your best interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden buying opportunities . They can also often help you analyse data and better predict trends around your search . <p> Saving money . A good realtor will review their client 's closing agreement and ensure they are n't being charged for unnecessary items from the developer or builders ( e.g. community building fees the city did n't charge ) . <p> Understand floor plans . Agents will be able to point out any small details , such as the location of garbage shoots on your floor . If your condo is n't built yet , they can take you through the floor plan and fill you in on every detail . Floor plans are n't the easiest to read , and buyers can often miss small details . Sites such as condonow have great details on condo floor plans . <p> Familiarity with developer contracts . Realtors will be able to tell you exactly what you 're getting , pointing out any legal clauses that possibly have been issues in the past . <p> Buying direct from the developer almost always means your buying a pre-construction condo , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . With pre-construction you are obviously the first owner so you get to customize the purchase . They can often be cheaper than re-sale and you have more time to save for the overall down payment . <p> However , you 're relying on a floor plan that may look completely different once it 's finished and you may have to pay phantom rent ( payments you pay the builder that do n't count toward your mortgage ) . <p> The biggest difference when working direct with a developer 's sales rep , is that they represent the building , not you . They may have just been hired by the project and may have very little experience related to your contract or some of the more complicated details of the project . <p> Whichever route you choose , there are 2 things you should never compromise on : <p> Research . Research is essential . After all , you 're making a major investment . Research not only the reputation of the builder , but also the developer , potential real estate agents , legal contracts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and negative . You need to be prepared and know how to handle the situation if something happens . Some great examples of comparisons such as this condo comparison for the entertainment district in Toronto can be found here <p> Seek other legal advice . Seek out legal advice outside of what the developer or home builders recommend . Builders often recommend law firms so they can get to their projects as quickly as possible . But that often leaves you with a 50-page contract you do n't understand , written in their favour . Do n't sign it without going over it with a lawyer " one you seek out personally . <p> Condo buying is fraught with twists and turns that can be confusing for anyone buying a home , new or seasoned . However , hiring an agent or buying directly from the developer relies ultimately on your specific wants and needs . Do as much research as you can first , so that you 're in a good position to start , regardless of what direction you untimely end up taking . 
@@98430903 @2630903/ <h> The One Condos Sam Mizrahi Reveals What Makes this Toronto Condo One of a Kind <p> It 's over a year later and a lot has changed for The One Condos since our last exclusive interview . We had the privilege of interviewing Sam Mizrahi again and he gave us all the luxurious details on what is sure to be one of the most iconic residential structures in Toronto . - We 've learned about the floor plans , the amenities , and the pure luxury of the building . Sam also tells us about the extravagant Yorkville area and what it means to be at One Bloor West . <p> Part 1 of 3 <h> " So , last time we interviewed you was over a year ago , since then , quite a lot has changed ! How is the project coming along ? " <p> Incredibly well . I could not be more grateful with the evolution the building went through because I think we got a better building out of it . We 've had consultations with the city over 2.5 years , the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did with the OMB of settling with the adjacent neighbours , and you know what , when we got to the OMB , there were no appellants . That was because we evolved their concerns and took their concerns to reengineer the building . We got a better building out of it . <h> " Do you think any other condos built or under construction in Toronto are in the same league as this building ? " <p> You know I ca n't say because I do n't have knowledge of every application . I would say this is a very unique building . You know there 's only one and excuse the pun , but there 's really only one building like this . I ca n't imagine , even ourselves being able to replicate this anywhere else in the city for a variety of reasons . We have a cost of over a billion dollars in the building just in construction . If you think about that and just do the math , where else in the city could you do the same and be able to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor tenants you would need and the rent rates you would need and when you start to do all that math , there 's very few places that command that type of price to be able to build a project of that nature and to basically have something that really exceeds all expectations without any compromises . Usually what ends up happening is you end up compromising somewhere in the building . Because of just financial reasons . This building has got 0 compromises in it , like 0 . And that 's why it is what it is . And when you build something like this and develop something where you have n't compromised to any aspect of the building , you really ca n't replicate that . <p> This is our Art . We 're building and we 're putting our heart and soul and our sweat and tears into it to build something that really is one of a kind . It truly is a one of a kind building . And the exoskeleton and the structural engineering of the building and the forming and the finishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the building . You know we have 31 foot sidewalks all with snow mount heated , there 's going to be a gathering area for festivities like the Christmas tree and water features like fountains and things like that where it 's a gathering place . There 's so many aspects of this building really when I think about it , you know this is Bloor Street , it 's the equivalent of what you 'd see us doing on Fifth Avenue in New York or Michigan Ave or London in Knightsbridge . There 's really nowhere else in the city where you can do that . There 's only one Yonge and Bloor there 's only one Bloor street to build something like this architecturally . You know , if someone asked me where 's number 2 of this development , I do n't know ? I struggle with it . <h> " When we last spoke , this One Bloor West Condo was 72 residential floors with 544 units , we understand that you guys have actually reduced that ? " <p> We 're going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're probably going to be 380/370 units . But a lot of people are probably going to be combining units from what we 've seen before and I think we 're probably going to have less than 350 units . <h> " For the buyers who combine units is it going to be the same deposit structure ? " <p> Same deposit structure . Same in all our buildings : 20% over a year plus 5% on occupancy . <h> " What 's amazing is that The One Condos has the height and the view . " <p> You can see all the way to New York . We actually have a drone that went off to show you each view shot . What 's amazing is Yonge &amp; Bloor and where we 're located in the South West Corner . Yonge &amp; Bloor is on the top of Toronto 's topography and going south to the lake , the elevation goes down . Because the lake is at a lower altitude than Yonge &amp; Bloor , it 's almost like you 're putting the building on a pedestal at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to tell you they took my breath away . Every angle the view stretched for like decades . <h> " What floor do you need to be on for an unobstructed view ? " <p> 25 floors for unobstructed views . I could n't believe it . We kept going back because I thought something was wrong with the cameras . But it 's right . The reason is our ground floor is 34 feet . Our podium is at 61 metres . Retail 18 foot , amenities 18 feet and then you jump in the residential at 10 feet . We got approved at the OMB for an 82 storey building at 306.6m or 1005 ft but its equivalent to 100 storeys because of the ceiling heights . <p> The views are just unbelievable . It 's unbelievable . East view you 'd have to be higher up in the building but because of the way we 've angled and done everything , your views are still clear because you 're seeing through the building . <h> " So with such a tall building , how many elevators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton of time in the elevators ? " <p> 27 elevating devices in The One Condos , and the core that take you to the residential units out of the 27 are 8 . Wait time of less than a minute . We 're using smart technology where the elevators are floating amongst the floors and its destination request . They 're basically destination elevators , so the computers run on the traffic and destination requests and the elevators float in the building . There 's actually no buttons inside the elevator . <h> " And The One Condos Interior Design is by ? " <p> It 's Foster + Partners . <h> " Who will be managing the building after its incorporated ? How will you ensure your standards of luxury are maintained ? " <p> We will be running it after it 's built as well to insure that . Who better to run the building afterwards than the person who built it ? Because we know every detail . We will run it as long as the condo board wants us to . For sure the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have an obligation to do it . I 'm going to be on the board because I 'm owning a unit there . Nobody better than us to ensure that the same value system and quality we have in the building is maintained throughout . <h> " Does the building have any high performance / environmental features ? " <p> We 're utilizing greenhouse construction- and we have undertaken the City of Toronto 's Tier 2 environmental standards which is the highest one they have . So we have everything from a green roof to all the low-VOC in any of the paints and the hardwoods all going into the greenhouse certified methodology . Plus the building is built to the 9001 standards , which is standard for us . All units have their own heat pump units with humidifiers and HEPA filters . This is really going state of the art in terms of air quality air handling systems are going to be second to none , also specifically for our anchor tenants who have a requirement for those types of system . Everything about this building is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything I 've seen in Canada . It 's really taking it to the next level in terms of environmental .

@@98430920 @2630920/ <h> Helping Your Kids Invest In a New Condo <p> The cost of a new condo in Toronto has risen significantly over the past few years and most younger adults are now simply being squeezed out of the market . The result , parents are stepping in to help with the purchase by either assisting with the down payment or co-signing so a loan can be approved . <p> Parents participate primarily in 2 differently ways to help their children buy their first condo . Some parents have the finances available to offer a loan and others are able to offer the money straight up as a gift . How much parents can help is also affected by how many children they have . They will often want to make sure that each child has the same option when it comes time for them to leave the family nest . <p> There are a few key questions any supportive parent should ask themselves before offering to help their children with this type of real estate investment . They need to first be sure the child will be making enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upkeep and repairs of the property . <p> Also , the parent needs to be sure that if the child is married , that the marriage is stable and properly structured legally . One way to avoid any potential issues in this area is to make sure that the money given in this scenario is done as a loan and not as a gift . This does not necessarily mean that the loan needs to be ever paid back , but it does give the parent the option to ask for the loan to be repaid in case something like a separation or divorce does take place . <p> If a parent co-signs for a mortgage loan , they will either be listed on the title or as a guarantor of the property . Lenders can often make this a necessary step even if the parents only have a 1% interest in the property . - As long as the parents are on title , this 1% can not be transferred back to the children at any time without a new mortgage being put in place . <p> Another issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan is the eligibility of the HST new home rebate . If someone other than a parent is assisting with the loan , then the buyer will not qualify for this rebate . According to the law , everyone on the title needs to be moving in to the new home or has to be a direct relation to the person moving in . If the buyer receives the rebate and the income tax authorities investigate in the future , the buyer could be responsible for up to $27,000 . <p> Parents need to be aware that if they are listed on the mortgage , then they are responsible for any missed mortgage payments .

@@98430926 @2630926/ <h> Condo Rental Agreements " What you can and ca n't do as a landlord <p> If you are either currently or considering becoming a real estate investor and you plan on renting out your condo investment property , it 's important to fully understand what you can and can not do as a landlord of your property . Specifically if your investment takes the shape of a new condo , the devil is often in the details . <p> Here is a great example to consider . Recently , three Ontario Divisional Court Judges made a ruling that landlords were not allowed to enter an occupied property in order to take pictures. - The ruling clearly stated that landlords can only enter an rental property is if the lease states that they may , if and only if they receive written consent from the tenant , for each entry request . <p> In one case , the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Board had evicted a tenant who would not allow their landlord to take pictures in order to list the property for sale. - The tenant only refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet. - The Ontario Land and Tenant Board evicted her stating that the lease allowed entry to the landlord under any circumstances. - However , during the appeal process , the Divisional Court Judges stated that the lease was in fact not written with that specific stipulation . <p> According to sections 26 and 27 of the Residential Tenancies Act of 2006 , the landlord may only enter a property for certain reasons. - These reasons include a case of emergency , to clean the unit if the lease states that it needs to be done by the landlord , to show the unit to prospective tenants , to do repairs , to allow a potential mortgagee or insurer to see the property or to carry out an inspection of a property. - A landlord needs specific permission from the tenant to enter for any and all other reasons . <p> For the appeal , the judges stated that even though the landlord was allowed to enter the property and show it to prospective tenants , there was nothing in writing that allowed the landlord to take pictures whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ending than another one a few years back. - In that case , a landlord had taken pictures inside a property for a damage inspection. - Those pictures were eventually deemed necessary because they were taken for inspection purposes and were therefore allowed in the Residential Tenancies Act .

What makes the Tea Garden Condos different from any other condo ? Explain the vision . <p> Henry Strasser : - After the success of Jade Condos we wanted something very small and unique . The Tea Garden will be an 11-storey , boutique building . Amenities included will be a fitness centre , tea-lounge and outdoor hot tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a tea and relax . We 're trying to create something that does n't currently exist in the marketplace . <p> CN : Tea Garden is a unique name in itself , please tell us how you came up with it ? <p> HS : Basically , Teagarden court is the street/cul-de-sac where the building will be located . We 're aiming at a broader demographic including new Canadians . - We wanted an exotic name to help capture that broader consumer base . Tea is a big part of Eastern cultures " The name was a perfect fit <p> CN : Kirkor Architects have an impressive resume which includes the Cinema Tower and the Chicago , what 's it like working with them ? <p> HS : It 's great because they know the area better than anyone else having constructed approximately 8 buildings in the area . We 've worked with them in the past and it was a pleasure . Interior design will be handled by Thomas Pierce who we have also worked with before Tea Garden . They are very trendy and have a contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average price per square foot is a competitive $584/per sqft . We have a great location which is key for success . Tea Garden will feature a mix of units : townhouses , lofts , and 95 one and two bedroom units . Suite sizes range from 480 sqft to approximately 900 sqft range . There are no bachelors/studios . Our penthouses range from 604 sqft to 932 sqft . Prices range from the mid $200 's to the high $500 's . Estimated completion for Tea Garden will be in early 2018 . <p> CN : Who will be the target buyer at the Tea Garden Condos ? <p> HS : Demographics in the area predict that we 'll get a lot of buyers that will occupy as their primary residence , including first-time buyers and empty-nesters . The building we designed and went after has a boutique feel . Investors will probably interested in the smaller units for rentals . A lot of the interest we 've attracted thus far have been the bigger units with people looking to downsize . We really wanted to keep the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CN : We know your original plan was for 14 storeys and 144 units which got reduced to 11 storeys and 111 units , why the reduction ? <p> HS : Unfortunately we could n't secure all the land we needed to sustain the original plans . The land we currently have can sustain 11 storeys with a 12th floor amenity space so we went with that . Same reason we went with three row housed instead of five . Sometimes compromises have to be made . <p> CN : We know that this site took some negotiation with multiple single-family home owners . Please explain what this process is like . <p> HS : We wanted five houses right away but had to deal with every person individually . We got number 2-4-6-and 10 . However we could n't buy #8 . Someone gave him a better offer which he took and he did n't give us a chance to match . That 's why we had three houses in a row but could n't get the five. - It 's quite the experience dealing with all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CN : Do you anticipate any issues with construction ? <p> HS : No , it should be very easy to build . It 's not downtown which is good and we also have access off Teagarden court . Of course I 'd like to have all 5 houses in a row but it is what it is . <p> CN : Bayview Village has definitely changed in the past 5 years , how do you see the area in the next 3-10 years after the Tea Garden Condos is built and for the future ? <p> HS : It 's booming . We see a Pusateris , revamped mall , and many other amenities coming to the area . Every time I go to the mall something new is being built or renovated . I do n't know if there is any more land to add more retail but we can potentially see more retail . The location is a minute from everything and it 's great to see these new condos support the area . <p> CN : We know in the near future Phantom Development plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us about this project ? What should we look forward to ? <p> HS : Everyone wants it , that 's all . Every broker , agent , everyone . ( Smiles ) I 'm just joking . It 's a big one , literally the best location in the city . We hope to launch in the fall . Right now we 're designing the sales centre . It 's a beautiful project . We feel this one will be better suited for an investors interested in small units . <p> CN : Any future plans for Phantom Development ? <p> HS : We have lots on our plate . We hope Tea Garden is successful and moves quickly . Cumberland is a six-year plan . We 'll get Tea Garden off the ground then work on Cumberland . We typically try and buy the best location , give value to the purchaser and sell for less than our competitors . Cumberland has a different magnitude so we wo n't be able to finish quickly . It 'll be a six-year project no matter what . <p> CN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Condos ? <p> HS : We 'll be able to better measure it in 4 months . It 's a small project so I 'm hoping to start construction in a year . We 'll know very quickly in sense of sales . We 're hoping people love our layouts and finishes as much as we do , because it 's hard not to love the location . <p> CN : Any last words ? <p> HS : Tea Garden is the best location in that area , literally 50 feet from Bayview Village . We think we have an edge over everyone else . The price point , the finishes , and location are the best in the area . Make sure you get in at launch .

@@98431166 @2631166/ <h> New Condo Rental Guarantees " How they work <p> Rental guarantees are becoming one of the more popular incentives offered by new condo builders in the GTA . New Condo Investors in turn are gaining peace of mind from the financial safety net that can accompany this type of new condo construction promotion . <p> How Does a Rental Guarantee Work ? <p> While there are many variances between agreements in most rental guarantees , also known as leaseback agreements , the contracts will usually include a guaranteed rental dollar amount per unit per month , which then spans over a 1 to 2 year term . The amount of rent is pre-determined by the developer using expected rental appreciation rates for that specific area . <p> An example of a current rental guarantee in downtown Toronto : <p> Rent is guaranteed at 6% of your purchase price on a monthly basis . You receive the rental payments monthly and your condo is professionally managed for the duration of the contact . <p> Typically the rental guarantee contracts have a clause allowing you to opt out and rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits ? <p> The most up front benefits of having a rental guarantee in place are that your unit will be occupied and you will receive rent payments , for a set term . The side benefit to this is that it makes the process of obtaining a mortgage on the property a little easier . <p> Things to look for in a rental guarantee contract <p> The devil is in the details . As with any contract or program there are always pros and cons . It 's a great idea to shop around and become familiar with different offerings . Minimally the guaranteed rental rate should cover your monthly overhead . It also should be at or above the current market rate . Make sure you check the date for when the rental income commences . Ideally you want it to begin from the time you take possession of the condo ( Pre-registration ) . Some rental guarantees may begin the date your mortgage kicks in ( registration ) and you officially own the property. - This could create a small gap where you new condo sits empty and you do not have any rental income .
