For instance , during the campaign , Trump proposed eliminating personal exemptions while expanding tax breaks for child and dependent care , but the latest White House outline barely touched these topics , Luscombe said . <h> Capital-gain continuity <p> Top rates on long-term capital gains , which got as high as 35% in the 1970s , have come down since then to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately of- adjusting these rates. - This implies- the current three levels- of- 0% , 15%- and 20%- could continue on capital gains ( and qualified dividends ) . <p> A related- question is whether capital-gains rates will be linked to ordinary tax rates , as is currently the case. - For example , people who fall into the- 10% or- 15%- brackets on ordinary income pay a 0% capital gains rate , while those- in the next four- ordinary brackets pay 15% on- capital gains .

The one-page White House update did n't address this , though subsequent comments by Administration officials suggest current retirement incentives will be retained . Retirement-plan simplification also is a possibility , Luscombe said . <p> If either the standard deduction is increased- or- itemized deductions scaled back , fewer people would itemize , simplifying tax-return preparation and planning for millions . <h> Repeal of affluent taxes <p> Several- taxes that apply to a fairly small subset of wealthy taxpayers face- repeal- under Trump .

These include- the fate of the 0.9% Medicare tax- on earned income . <h> Corporate tax rates <p> The recent " Trump bump " stock market rally has been based- in part on the prospect of lower corporate tax rates .

At 6-3 , 200 pounds , fast and physical , King would have looked good opposite the similarly built Richard Sherman . <p> And if another team waves the proper trade bait to lure Sherman away , King would seem to give the Seahawks a good start toward replacing him . <p> At No. 31 , the pick the Seahawks sent to San Francisco , the 49ers took Alabama linebacker Reuben Foster . <p> Foster was the 2016 Butkus Award winner .

Ethan Pocic is 6-6 , 317 pounds , and played center at LSU .

And they spoke on that Sunday , the day before the national championship game . <p> And we know Dooley , a West Orange , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the University of North- Carolina Wilmington job that went to longtime North Carolina assistant C.B. McGrath . <p> We also know the New Mexico program seems to be a bit of a mess and apparently another name most have mentioned as a frontrunner along with Dooley consistently in the search has said he also is " not in the running for the job . " That 's what Cross reportedly told The Albuquerque Journal on Sunday . <p> In a Monday morning tweet , ESPN 's Goodman wrote : " With James Borrego &amp; Scott Cross out of the situation at New Mexico , two- names still in the mix as of last night : Joe Dooley and Steve Forbes . " <p> Forbes , of East Tennessee State , was briefly mentioned early on during speculation , shortly after Craig- Neal was fired just before midnight two Friday nights ago . His name also has picked up steam , especially within the fanbase , recently . <p> Forbes is 51-20 , including 28-8 in Southern Conference play , in two East Tennessee State seasons after serving as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during which the Shockers made the Sweet 16 . The Bucs won the SoCon tournament and made their 10th NCAA tournament appearance last season . As a 13th seed , they lost , 80-65 , to fourth-seeded Florida in Orlando just before 14th-seeded FGCU 's 86-80 loss against third-seeded Florida State on March 16 . <p> The New Mexico athletic department seems to be a bit of a mess . The Journal reported Sunday that New Mexico Gov . Susana Martinez has used veto power to " remove state funding for New- Mexico colleges and universities from a Legislature-approved spending package . " According to the story , 58 percent of the- University of New Mexico 's funding comes from the state . That apparently means state universities ca n't submit their 2018 budgets- by the usual cutoff date of May 1 . <p> Krebs told the Journal in an email all of that will have " no impact " on the coaching search . And earlier in the week , he told the Journal money wo n't be an obstacle to the hire . <p> Buy Photo <p> Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his team during a game against University of North Florida at Alico Arena in Fort Myers , Fla. , on Monday , Jan. 30 , 2017 . ( Photo : Logan Newell/Special to the Naples Daily News ) <p> But as the Journal reported , New Mexico athletics , which owes the fired - Neal $1 million for his buyout , had a $1.54- million deficit last year , and men 's basketball attendance dipped to a 51-year low last season . Krebs told the Journal last week some- layoffs are coming . Unlike most non-mid-majors , the Lobos fly commercially . Just over four years ago , Steve Alford ( who ended up- leaving for UCLA ) had a package that could have paid him $2 million per year . Krebs hired Neal at $750,000 and he made $950,000- last season . <p> In a Sunday blog , Geoff Grammer , who covers the New Mexico beat for the Journal , wrote : " Now , some suggest what 's being offered- is n't near the compensation package Neal was receiving and that other concerns might have an impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is $275,000 . Kavanagh gave him a $35,000 bump after last season and is working on another extension and raise . He said Monday he and Dooley " had good dialogue " about that before the Final Four , but they have not communicated about the New Mexico situation since Dooley gave Krebs permission to speak with his coach , a common professional courtesy . <p> Dooley is 92-44 at FGCU , including 26-8 last season . He has led the Eagles to their only two Atlantic Sun regular-season titles and- back-to-back NCAA tournament appearances . <p> Neal was 76-52 at New Mexico . The Lobos were 17-14 last season and failed to make the NCAA tournament for the third straight- year . He was fired just before midnight , Albuquerque time , on March 31 . <p> In a press conference last week , Krebs said he 's looking for a coach who will make New Mexico a " regional national power " again as- well as one that contends for the Mountain West title and an NCAA tournament berth every season . He said he expects the Lobos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who settled on elevating Neal from assistant to head coach after just four days in 2013 following Alford 's departure to UCLA , said the- next hire must be a fantastic player developer and an " outstanding recruiter . " He also said he must be a " proven head coach , " which- seemed to eliminate Borrego . Yet some Albuquerque media outlets reported that Borrego had been offered and accepted the job Thursday night . <p> Krebs also said during the press conference : " We 're going to have to be creative on the financial package we put together in order to attract- the best candidate , and I think that 's someone who 's willing to be flexible about the financial package as well . " <p> This all might have been just too much for Dooley -- who has a loaded roster for next season -- to deal with .

Baez , used as a utilityman during the season but mostly as a second baseman in the playoffs , put on a defensive clinic during the first two rounds . <p> He frustrated the San Francisco Giants with his ability to go deep behind second base to snag grounders and turn singles into outs , then amazed the Los Angeles Dodgers , once by running in from short right field to defend a bunt and another time by converting a 4-3 double play with remarkable body control . <p> Baez also twice started double plays by alertly letting liners hit the ground just before catching them on a short-hop and nabbing frozen runners off base . <p> He 's the most natural baseball player I 've ever seen play the game , ' ' said Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks , who benefited from Baez 's glove work in winning Game 6 of the NLCS .

After overcoming his homesickness and learning English , he became a star at Montverde Academy , a prep school outside Orlando . <p> He and Baez played travel ball together and , in February 2011 , they faced each other in a high school game attended by more than 100 baseball officials intent on getting a first-hand look at two of that year 's most exciting seniors . <p> I remember that game , ' ' Lindor said with his ever-present smile .

He 's even drawing comparisons to Hall of Fame second baseman Roberto Alomar , a fellow Puerto Rican . <p> At the plate , Baez has tempered his attacking style , cutting down his strikeouts to 24% and batting .273 with 14 homers and 59 RBI in 142 games . <p> I had such a big leg kick and swung so hard that I could n't stay balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Baez said .

They failed to persuade lawmakers to increase cash going into- land purchases through the Florida Forever program . <p> This year , land conservation is faring- even worse . Lawmakers- have proposed defunding a program that pays ranchers not to develop their lands , therefore freeing the state from having to manage those properties . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to give Florida Forever , and neither is close to the $100 million some environmentalists hoped .

Next fall was going to be his time to shine . <p> " I worked my whole life for it and- I started my first game Sunday night , " the midfielder said about the Bulls ' first spring game at Gannon University , " and Monday morning it was all gone . " <p> Shortly after 8 a.m . Aspenleiter and his teammates gathered in a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that UB men 's soccer was among the four sports the university had decided to cut . Their careers , at least at UB , were over . <p> " Everyone was completely blindsided , " said Aspenleiter , an- All-Greater Rochester pick and the Monroe County Division II Player of the Year in 2014 as a Mendon senior . <p> Players heard rumors about- budget issues and that soccer might be losing a scholarship or two . But nothing like this , " Ryan Aspenleiter said , his voice still hushed- about 60 hours after finding out his career might be done . " No one ever expected this . " <p> UB also announced it's- dropping- baseball , men 's swimming and divining and women 's rowing . The cuts start for the 2017-18 school year . In addition to Aspenleiter , who helped Mendon win a state co-championship in 2013 , Le Roy 's Ethan Witkowski was also on the Bulls soccer team .

That 's the minimum necessary to compete at the Division I. The university says eliminating these four teams will save it $2 million annually . The Buffalo News reported that UB 's athletic budget in 2015-16 was $31.9 million , third-highest in the 12-team Mid-American Conference . Its- struggling football program accounts for $7.53 million . <p> UB athletic director Allen Greene told the News a proposal for a new $18 million field house for football is still moving forward . <p> The MAC requires league members to field teams in football , men 's and women 's basketball and women 's volleyball . <p> The cuts " followed a comprehensive review , " of its athletic budget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The timing could n't have been worse , " Aspenleiter said . <p> That 's because spots and scholarships at most other schools are locked in for the fall season , making it tougher for UB players to find a new school. - The timing also stings for men 's soccer because the Bulls were coming off two solid seasons . They went 12-4-3 last fall " the most wins they 've had since 2005 " and 8-7-4 in 2015 , their first winning season since 2008 . UB also just celebrated Russ Cicerone becoming its first Major League Soccer Draft pick ( fourth round ) . <p> The timing is even worse for one UB assistant coach , former Rochester Rhinos player Michael Tanke . The 27-year-old- left his job as an assistant at the University of Dayton in late February to start at UB in early March . Now Tanke will soon be out- of a job . A Rhinos midfielder from 2011-13 , he'd- spent two years at Dayton . <p> It begs the question : How long ago did the administration know soccer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bulls head coach Stu Riddle left on Jan. 9 to take the head coaching job at Northern Kentucky . Assistant Davie Carmichael was elevated to the top job a- few weeks later . UB was one of only four MAC schools to play men 's soccer ( with Akron , Bowling Green , Northern Illinois and Western Michigan ) . West Virginia plays in the MAC in men 's soccer , too , so it 's down to a five-team league . <p> Ryan Aspenleiter signs an autograph for a young fan after at UB Bulls men 's soccer game .

" <p> " My recommendation is for Brevard County to eliminate the use of polystyrene containers on all public property and by vendors on public property and local government contractors , " Booth said in her request . <p> " I know cost is a factor " in why such products are commonly used , Booth said . <p> But she contends that the environmental and health costs should outweigh the monetary costs . <p> She told commissioners that more than 110 counties and cities nationwide have placed restrictions on polystyrene . <p> According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department , less than 1 percent of polystyrene is recycled in the United States , - largely because of a relatively high recycling cost of more than $3,000 per ton . <p> Booth says she plans to follow up with the county on the progress of devising the pilot program . <p> Depending on how the county proceeds , the county response to Booth 's proposal indicated that it could affect purchases of supplies by the county , food service vendors who do business on county property , public events hosted on county property and private events held at rented county park sites . <p> Booth said she hopes to address the Brevard School Board about the authorizing a similar program with Brevard Public Schools , since the County Commission action does not affect the school system . <p> County Commission Vice Chair Rita Pritchett promised to contact school board members , asking that they to push the issue as well . <p> " I do n't like these at all , " Pritchett said , holding up the school food tray that Oliver handed her moments earlier . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written comments received from Brevard County government departments to the Speak Up Brevard citizen request to eliminate use or sale of polystyrene products on public property : <p> Natural Resources Management Department : " Use of less harmful products is preferred for protection of public health , natural resources and wildlife . However , the costs and benefits of alternative materials , as well as the cost and feasibility of education and enforcement , need to be considered . A pilot program or phased-in approach could be considered . " <p> Parks and Recreation Department : " Parks is in a difficult position to facilitate this recommendation . We have approximately 238 active agreements/contracts and have permitted 4,671 rentals . " <p> Purchasing Department : " A phased-in approach would need to be considered to allow existing agreements to term , or contracts would need to be renegotiated to incorporate the restrictions . Area local businesses would need to be educated and allowed sufficient time to exhaust their inventory or coolers , cups , plates , bags , etc . The community as a whole would need to agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents of Brevard County . But , - to do so , the cost to educate and enforce can be significant to the county taxpayer . " <p> Solid Waste Management Department : - " Because polystyrene is very light and bulky ( probably about 95 percent air ) , it takes up a lot of space in trash- cans and dumpsters , which means they become full more quickly , need to be emptied more often . Therefore , - disposing of large quantities of polystyrene increases collection costs to the customer . Since the Solid Waste- Management Department annually assesses customers for disposal based on the number of trash containers- they use and the frequency of collection , dealing with large volumes of polystyrene does impact the costs for- collection and disposal . On a per-ton basis , it is more expensive to manage loads of polystyrene versus heavier waste streams , as it takes more effort to handle and compact . "

Terms like launch angle and exit velocity are creeping into the baseball lexicon , and it 's not just number crunchers jumping on board . The successes of Josh Donaldson , Bautista and Kris Bryant are changing the way hitters and coaches think about the swing . ( AP Photo/Eric Christian Smith , File ) ( Photo : The Associated Press ) <p> Josh Donaldson and Reggie Jackson stood off to the third base side of the batting cage , a pair of former American League MVPs discussing their craft in spring training . When the Blue Jays star hopped in to take his swings , Mr. October pulled out his phone to shoot video , a visual aid for his job as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's swing , it 's something new and different , " the 70-year-old Jackson said . " I wanted him to interpret it for me . " <p> Donaldson is an early adopter to a growing big league trend " hitters fixated on producing fly balls . Or , as Donaldson put it recently on Twitter : <p> " Just say NO .... to ground balls . " <p> Donaldson put his career on the upswing by , well , swinging up , and he 's not alone . Toronto teammate Jose Bautista achieved stardom by adding some loft , and Chicago Cubs slugger Kris Bryant has prioritized hitting the ball in the air his entire career . Detroit 's J.D. Martinez and the Dodgers ' Justin Turner have made millions since deciding to shoot for the sky . <p> It does n't take an aerospace degree to see why . On ground balls in 2016 , big league hitters had a .239 average and .258 slugging percentage . On line drives and fly balls combined , they hit .411 with a .785 slugging percentage . <p> For those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore . Over the past two seasons , MLB.com posted data provided by Statcast , a tracking system that records the distance , speed and trajectory of batted balls . <p> The numbers make one thing clear " it 's good to hit the ball hard , but it 's better to hit it hard and high . <p> " I 've done a lot of research , " Donaldson said . " I 'm confident in what I do and I believe in it . " <p> Before the 2013 season , Donaldson re-engineered his swing with the help of Bobby Tewksbary , a hitting instructor whose playing career topped out in the independent Can-Am Association . The 33-year-old works out of a facility in Nashua , New Hampshire , and has helped a number of major leaguers , including Chris Colabello , A.J. Pollock and Matt Joyce . <p> Tewksbary is on a mission to make hitters better by debunking the axiom against swinging up . He felt his own career was hindered by the hitting instruction he got as a young player " he was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Johnny Little League coach says to swing down , get on top , and hitters will literally swing down , " he said . <p> Tewksbary thinks the terminology does more harm than good " and he 's not nearly the most famous dissenter of that baseball adage . <p> In his book The Science of Hitting , Ted Williams bemoaned that hitters " always heard that the ideal swing is level or ' down . ' " The Hall of Famer advocated a " slight upswing " because it " puts the bat flush in line with the path of the ball for a longer period . " That is , if the ball is traveling down from the pitcher 's hand to the catcher 's glove , the best chance at solid contact is to swing the bat on the same plane " up toward the pitcher 's release point . <p> " For years and years , people have disagreed with the greatest hitter of all-time , " Tewksbary said . <p> None of those hitters swung like they were hunting for well-placed ground balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full-blown upper cut . The adjustment for players like Donaldson is more subtle than just selling out for air balls . <p> " I 'm going up there to drive the ball , which means get the ball in the air , " said hulking Phillies catcher Cameron Rupp , who hit 16 homers in 105 games last season . <p> " I want to be on plane with the ball as early as I can and stay through it as long as I can , " he added . " That creates backspin . That creates the ball getting in the air . That 's kind of what I 'm looking to do . " <p> For generations , hitters have been instructed to drive the knob of the bat toward the ball . Instead , Donaldson keeps his hands close to his back shoulder longer , letting his barrel first tip slightly toward the catcher . That allows him to get the bat on plane with the pitch sooner and swing through the ball on a slight upward trajectory . <p> The science can get technical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab to the diamond . <p> " To start to get into angles and lift and launch , I mean , we 've got some smart guys , " Boston manager John Farrell said , " but they might not be going to Harvard . " <p> The fact is that not all players think they 'd benefit from more information . Plus , hitters are n't keen on reconstructing their swings after they 've already reached the majors . <p> " The more technical I get , the bigger hole I dig , " Boston slugger Mitch Moreland said . " I try to keep it as simple as I can . " <p> " You do n't launch at this angle , this and that , " added Red Sox outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr . " Whether it 's down or up , hard always has more of a chance of being a hit than soft . " <p> But results from hitters like Donaldson and Bryant are n't going unnoticed . On a near-daily basis , players hear talk of launch angles and exit velocities on TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , if they want it . <p> " There 's too much data to ignore the value of hitting the ball in the air , " Tewksbary said , adding that the approach is " not new , but the understanding we have is new . " <p> And so is the appreciation . The success stories are piling up " last year , Washington 's Daniel Murphy , Texas ' Jonathan Lucroy and Detroit 's Nicholas Castellanos improved their performance after significantly cutting their ground ball rates . <p> It 's not just the number crunchers taking notice anymore . <p> " Google me , it will tell you that I understand the swing , too , " said Jackson , a Hall of Famer with 563 career home runs . " But I have a job to do for the Yankees , to help the new players , to help this organization win . So I take the time to hear and understand the new vernacular . " <p> Jackson found in his cage-side chat that Donaldson has n't reinvented the wheel so much as he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ty Cobb to Miguel Cabrera , " Jackson said , " when you get to the baseball , whether it 's Cobb , Ruth or Gehrig , or Donaldson and Bautista , the impact ( of the bat on ball ) travels in the same spot . <p> " Josh Donaldson does what I did , " Jackson added . " He 's different getting there , but in the pay zone , he is taking the same groceries home that I did . " <p> <p> AP stringer Mark Didtler contributed to this story from Tampa , Florida .

A committee once spent 45 minutes debating whether a cheerleader should legally be considered an athlete , then passed nine exemptions to the state law in less than a minute , said Barbara Petersen , president of Florida 's First Amendment Foundation . <p> Legislators ' decisions are facing more scrutiny this legislative session because a scoring system drafted by Petersen will evaluate- their support for government openness . She said the public does n't understand how 1,119 exemptions to the state 's Sunshine Law can affect them , and legislators are n't always aware of all the implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who profess to support open government , but when push comes to shove , they take action that 's contrary to the public ability to oversee its government and hold it accountable , " Petersen said . <p> The scoring system for the Florida Society of News Editors will assign points for about 10 critical government openness bills this legislative session . Legislators will get three points for a floor vote , seven points for co-sponsoring a bill and 10 points for sponsoring a bill that 's on the list . Votes against openness will lose points ; votes for openness gain points . Legislators can also get a bonus point for communicating with the foundation about the bill . The scores ultimately will be compared to the session 's most extreme legislator " good or bad " and turned into standard letter grades for comparison . A perfectly neutral legislator will get a C. <p> Petersen said that criteria is as objective as it can be . The subjective part is in choosing which bills to criticize . Petersen said she 's looking for the most substantive , far-reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation to conceal addresses of groups of people , will not be on the list , she said . <p> A shoe-in for Petersen 's list : A revised proposal by Sen. Greg Steube of Sarasota , who would make attorney 's fees optional in lawsuits that a government agency loses . <p> Palm Beach County Commissioner Dave Kerner , who served four years in the Florida House of Representatives , said First Amendment Foundation 's selection of bills may make the scorecard too subjective . However , the scorecard can help drive the public to understand more of what the Legislature does with open records . <p> Kerner said the Sunshine Law 's access to public records is critical to public accountability of government . Yet some restrictions to Sunshine are fully justified , said Kerner , who helped pass a bill that cleared the way for the sheriff and state attorney to serve on the county 's Criminal Justice Commission by partly exempting their activities on the commission from Sunshine Law scrutiny . He also worked to better exempt address information of police officer 's spouses and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would agree those were good changes , said Kerner , a Democrat . <p> " I 'd encourage citizens to look at the substance of the bills before relying on a subjective score , " he said . <p> Petersen wants legislators to look more closely at the substance of the bills before voting on them and think of the implications for government sunshine . <p> Florida legislators are often tracked , and sometimes graded , on how they vote on bills being tracked by groups , from marijuana advocates to the Florida Sheriff 's Association . <p> Petersen said the scorecard should bring more openness to politicians ' attitude about government openness . Some restrictions have side effects , such as increasing costs and delays associated with getting government records that harm the public seeking information about government and burden the agencies . <p> " By doing this project and paying attention to what our legislators are doing , I hope that we educate the public and educate the legislators on the importance of these issues and bring attention and more consideration to all of these exceptions to the constitution , " she said .

@@97747297 @1947297/ <p> This is n't a column where I 'm going to tell you that Leonard Hamilton is a great coach . <p> Because I do n't believe that . I personally think he 's a good coach who has a very good team this season . One that has a chance to have a special postseason if it plays well . Or , on the flip side , a bitterly disappointing one if it does n't . <p> Such is life in the NCAA Tournament . <p> But what this column is intended to do is acknowledge what a great job Hamilton did with THIS team . And in reality , what he 's done with his program after the disappointment of the previous four years . <p> It 's not just that the Seminoles have won 25 games heading into the Madness , but it 's HOW they won those games . <p> Think about the last time FSU made it this far . It was 2012 . The Seminoles had just won an ACC Championship and like this team were a 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that struggled , sometimes mightily , on the other end of the court and yet was still able to win because it was just so suffocating on defense . <p> Now five years later the Seminoles are a No. 3 seed again . Only this time they 've won 25 games largely because of how efficient they are on offense . <p> There 's been a dramatic shift in how Hamilton coaches over the past half decade . No longer do we watch his team expecting an ugly , grind-it-out 53-48 type of game . <p> The Seminoles are second in the ACC in scoring and second in field goal percentage . <p> They 've scored 100 or more points five times this season . And nine times they 've scored at least 90 . <p> It 's a brand new style of play . <p> And Hamilton should be commended for that . <p> Again , this is n't to imply Hamilton has been a great coach at FSU . Five NCAA Tournaments in 15 years does n't qualify for that adjective . But is to say that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy so late in his career . <p> In 2012 , FSU was a senior-laden team that finished No. 5 in the country in field-goal percentage defense , No. 163 in offensive efficiency and No. 328 ( ! ! ! ) in turnover percentage . <p> In 2017 , FSU is most certainly not a senior-laden team and is currently No. 42 in field-goal percentage defense , No. 17 in offensive efficiency and No. 42 in turnover percentage . <p> Read those two sentences again . Let those numbers sink in . <p> That is a whole lot of change in just five years . <p> From 2009 to 2012 FSU was the best defensive team in the country . And more often than not when the Seminoles won " and they did that a lot during that stretch - the score would be somewhere in the 60s or low 70s . <p> Now , because of an influx of really skilled players ( which always helps ) , Hamilton wants team to play faster . Wants his team to get up and down more , pressure the ball more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities on the other end . <p> When Florida State wins now the score is usually in the 80s . Sometimes in the 90s . <p> Again , this is not normal for a coach to alter his style and philosophy like this . <p> Coaches who experience success at a high level are n't usually open to changing their ways so late in their careers . And do n't roll your eyes , people ! Hamilton DID experience success " four straight NCAAs , a Sweet 16 and an ACC title are terrific accomplishments " before this season . <p> He could 've tried to get back to those days . To recruit more guys like he had at the turn of the decade : Not overly skilled on offense but with potential to be defensive stoppers . <p> Instead he brought in Dwayne Bacon and Jonathan Isaac . That 's worked out pretty well , too . <p> And five years after their last appearance the Florida State men are back in the NCAA Tournament .

But there were two problems with this- seemingly measured approach . <p> For starters , the permission to settle- refugees in Michigan was not his ( or any- governor 's ) to deny . Someone unfamiliar with Snyder might have concluded that he was- clueless about the- federal government 's exclusive dominion over- immigration policy . But the governor was- merely exploiting the- ignorance of Trump 's Islamophobic constituents . <p> Last week , Adler again insisted- that Snyder had merely been seeking more detailed information about the- process , and that he had eventually received it . <p> So did the additional information satisfy the governor 's concerns ?

The jackpot was split three ways , by winning tickets in Kansas , Illinois and Maryland . <p> Would n't we all like to know what the winning numbers are ?

The jackpot was split three ways , by winning tickets in Kansas , Illinois and Maryland . <p> What will happen if you win a big prize ? Winners of large prizes must bring the winning ticket to lottery headquarters -- the amount at which you must show up in person varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction . The ticket will be examined by lottery security staff for authentication . The lottery usually gives some advice on seeking financial and legal advice along with some practical advice like getting an unlisted phone number . All but a very few states and provinces have laws that require the lottery to make public the name and city of every winner ( to assure the public that there are real winners ) . The lottery will ask the winner to participate in a press conference . Most take that option . It really is a good idea to get it over with since the press is likely to pursue your story until they get some questions answered . Questions are usually along the lines of " will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the money ? " or " how did you tell your family you won ? " After a few weeks the excitement usually dies down and you can go about your life . <p> Can winners remain anonymous ? Usually no . State and provincial lawmakers want the public to know that the lottery is honestly run and so require that at a minimum the name of the winner and their city of residence be made public . This way the public can be reassured that the prize really was paid out to a real person . <p> Some large lottery prizes pay out over a period of several years . What if the holder of this type of prize dies before collecting it all ? - In this case the prize is considered to be part of the estate and is passed along to the winner 's heirs . Contrary to popular belief , the prize does not revert to the government . The only exceptions are " win for life " games where a prize is guaranteed for the rest of the winner 's life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . <p> How long do I have to claim my prize ? The time to claim a prize varies from place to place , but typically is between six months and one year . <p> What happens to prizes that are n't claimed ? The disposition of unclaimed prizes varies from lottery to lottery and is governed by the laws of that state or province . In some cases all unclaimed prizes reenter the prize pool and increase the payout on future games . In other cases the money goes to the government to benefit the causes the lottery supports .

What we will never support , and neither should legislators , is any effort that makes it more convenient for minors to obtain liquor illegally . <p> This is a well-established Florida law that requires distilled spirits to be sold in a separate location from groceries . There has never been an outcry from the public about it because customers do not make a big deal out of walking a few extra feet to get from one store to the one that sells liquor next door . The outcry would understandably come from parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minors . <p> Year after year , Walmart uses the same talking points to support the repeal of a safety law in our state . Same playbook , same basic play with a slight route adjustment to account for technology influencing the marketplace and the profits of a global company . <p> Regarding fairness , it is entirely unfair to parents , law enforcement and all of our communities to do away with a law that prevents minors from having easy access to liquor through stores where they are free to roam and touch anything on the shelves unchecked . The current law protects against minors wandering into a liquor aisle unnoticed , with no one close enough to stop them from stealing or drinking from a bottle . <p> Based on the troubling details in a recent Bloomberg Business report titled , Walmart 's Out-of-Control Crime Problem Is Driving Police Crazy , which I encourage everyone to read , supporters of the repeal have a far bigger issue to worry about than this annual attempt at removing a law that has proven to keep minors safe .

Having portion control can be very helpful , and if you do n't often cook at home , picking up a meal like this- means no leftovers or extra ingredients . <p> But as someone who can broil a salmon filet and- make it taste delicious , keep some cooked brown rice handy , open a bag of frozen snap peas and eat 15 minutes after getting home , the concept seems a little silly to me , especially Fit Food stop .

@@97747413 @1947413/ <p> Sometimes accepted wisdom is n't so wise . Back in December I chastised a friend of mine , who booked a Southwest Airlines itinerary from the Northeast to the South with a connection in Chicago rather than Dallas . I patiently explained how savvy travelers should avoid cold-weather hubs during the winter . <p> I was quite wrong . In fact , the U.S. Department of Transportation 's latest Air Travel Consumer Report indicates that in December more flights arrived on time at Chicago Midway than at Dallas Love Field ( 82.0% to 73.4% ) ; what 's more , Midway also beat Love Field for on-time departures ( 74.1% to 65.6% ) . <p> So was this a one-time fluke ? Statistics say no . The extraordinarily harsh winters of recent years mean airports in warmer climates are experiencing fairly frequent doses of snow and ice . Some southern facilities are n't always prepared to deal with freezing temperatures , as exemplified by shortages of deicing fluid and snowplows . In short , it 's time to rethink accepted wisdom . <p> Snowballs in Dixie <p> Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough winter . The DOT 's latest on-time statistics reflect flights through December , but even without hard data we know that January , February and March have seen thousands of delayed and canceled flights . <p> Much of the industry 's negativity has centered on Dallas/Forth Worth . Recently , travel columnist Joe Brancatelli called DFW " the nexus of March 's evil , " noting more than 6,600 flights had been canceled there within 30 days , nearly twice as many as at Chicago O'Hare . Brancatelli concluded : " None of this comes as a surprise to travelers who increasingly view DFW as an unreliable facility in winter . " <p> In February , the Fort Worth Star-Telegram analyzed DOT data and found DFW ranked first in delays due to weather among the nation 's 29 largest " reportable " airports between 2009 and 2014 . DFW ranked eighth in canceled flights , at 2.25% . But this analysis did n't specifically address winter , so it included quite a few Texas thunderstorms . <p> Snow in North Texas is no anomaly . In December , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American 's hub in DFW , at just 65.2% , thus continuing a trend . In December 2013 , DFW 's on-time departures were even worse " 61.2% " while only 51.8% of flights departed on time at crosstown Love Field . Recently DFW has issued multiple statements on its winter weather responses . <p> As for Atlanta , the world 's busiest airport has weathered winter much better than Dallas in recent years . But when snow and freezing temps do hit Georgia , itineraries can unravel quickly , as they did during a storm in January 2014 . Those connecting through ATL when snow is predicted would be wise to rebook if possible . <p> Of course , many factors besides weather determine an airport 's on-time performance , including airborne congestion , ground congestion , navigational technology and the airlines themselves . In December , Delta led all U.S. carriers in on-time arrivals at 88.9% , far outpacing rivals American ( 76.7% ) , United ( 72.4% ) and Southwest ( 72.0% ) . ( Such statistics do n't include data for these carriers ' regional partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems safe to correlate performance among major airlines and their hubs ; it 's no surprise Delta was No. 1 in December , the same month Atlanta ranked first in arrivals and Detroit ranked first in departures . <p> Surprises abound <p> I decided to dig down and compare on-time arrivals and departures over the past five winters at ten major hubs in the Northeast , Midwest and South . I selected Atlanta , Chicago O'Hare , Dallas/Fort Worth , Denver , Detroit , Minneapolis-St . Paul and Newark , and eliminated fair-weather hubs such as Houston and Phoenix . And although Southwest does n't fit the traditional network hub-and-spoke model , I included three " focus cities " that serve as de facto hubs : Baltimore/Washington , Chicago Midway and Dallas Love Field . <p> What I found was that accepted wisdom should n't always be accepted . Exhibit A : Which of these ten major hubs posted the best on-time arrival and departure record in February 2014 ? It seems counter-intuitive to suggest MSP in snowy Minnesota , yet it 's true . <p> Here 's a month-by-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a Delta hub and Southwest stronghold " recorded some of the best on-time performance . But the leaders in on-time departures during recent Decembers were two other northern hubs Delta acquired from Northwest : Minneapolis and Detroit . The worst on-time stats for holiday flying were at Newark , the former Continental hub now operated by United . <p> January . In years past , geographical advantage paid off for Atlanta and both Dallas airports ( DFW and Love Field ) , though on-timers in Dallas plummeted this winter . Baltimore " a Southwest focus city " also performed well , as did Minneapolis . The worst on-time records during January were notched in Newark and Chicago 's O'Hare ( hub to both American and United ) and Midway ( Southwest ) . <p> February . It 's often the coldest and snowiest of months , but Atlanta and Baltimore have been more reliable than most hubs , and Minneapolis confounded expectations during February as well . In recent years O'Hare and Newark have lagged in on-time performance . Denver " a key city for United , Frontier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mountainous location it led in delayed departures only once , in February 2012 . <p> The lesson learned is that geography is n't the only consideration when connecting in winter , and do n't always assume warmer average temperatures = punctuality . <p> Booking smarter <p> Obviously we 're all at the mercy of the weather gods .

@@97747460 @1947460/ <p> The White House recently announced that it would be removing regulations subjecting its Office of Administration to Freedom of Information Act requirements . <p> The move is based on a court ruling from 2009 , and the curious timing has raised some eyebrows . But first let 's give you the basics : <p> Q : What is the Office of Administration ? <p> A : The Office of Administration , established by President Carter in 1977 , is a component of the Executive Office of the President that provides back-office support for the president . The office handles human resources , information technology , facilities and record-keeping support for the White House . <p> Q : What is the real impact of removing FOIA regulations ? <p> A : Since it was first established by President Carter in 1977 , the Office of Administration responded to FOIA requests under the Carter , Reagan , George H.W. Bush and Clinton administrations . The office is no longer required by regulation to respond to those requests . <p> The Office of Administration 's exemption from FOIA closes off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a significant part of the White House . Even if the Office of Administration does not legally have to respond to requests , repealing the FOIA regulation means there is no longer a mechanism to request " discretionary disclosures . " <p> Q : What is a discretionary disclosure ? <p> A : A discretionary disclosure is the voluntary disclosure of White House records . The Office of Administration has previously released White House visitor logs , annual salaries for the White House staff , and even White House beer recipes . Earnest said Tuesday those disclosures would continue despite the lack of a FOIA office . <p> Q : What about the other offices within the White House ? <p> A : Some other offices within the Executive Office of the President will continue to honor FOIA requests . They include the Council on Environmental Quality , the Office of Management and Budget , the Office of National Drug Control Policy , the Office of Science and Technology Policy and Office of the United States Trade Representative . <p> Presidential offices not subject to FOIA include the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Office of Administration , the Office of the Vice President , the Council of Economic Advisers , the National Security Council , the Office of Policy Development , the Domestic Policy Council , the Office of National AIDS Policy , the National Economic Council and the President 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board . <p> Q : Why is the White House doing this ? <p> A : The White House said the cleanup of FOIA regulations is consistent with court rulings that hold that the office is not subject to the transparency law . The most recent of those rulings came six years ago as the result of a lawsuit brought against the Bush administration by liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington . <p> CREW sued over e-mails deleted by the White House " as many as 22 million of them , by one accounting . The White House at first began to comply with that request , but then reversed course . <p> In 2009 , a federal appeals court in Washington found that the Office of Administration was exempt from FOIA " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the president and his staff and therefore , under our precedent , lacks substantial independent authority . " <p> The court ruled that the White House must archive e-mails , but it is not required to release them under FOIA . Instead , they can be released at least five years after the end of the administration under the Presidential Records Act . <p> Earnest called the repeal of the office 's FOIA regulation an " administrative change " that " has no impact on our compliance with the Freedom of Information Act . " <p> Q : What about transparency advocates ? <p> A : They say it ignores 30 years of historical precedent that the office was subject to FOIA . They also noted the irony of choosing to apply this ruling during the 10th annual Sunshine Week , an effort by news organizations and watchdog groups to highlight issues of government transparency . 
@@97747462 @1947462/ <h> How to spot a lottery winner <p> The Florida Lottery used to put a code on scratch-off lottery tickets . The three letter code was an indication of whether the scratch-off was a winner or not . An FTN for example , meant the ticket was a $15 winner . If the code was FHN , the ticket was a $500 winner . <p> A code such as KVX , or some other seemingly random and undecipherable group of letters , meant the card was n't a winner . <p> These codes are used by many states on their scratch-off tickets . And there is even a website and Facebook page devoted to the codes so that people can double-check their scratch-off tickets before discarding them . The codes were n't visible until the latex above them was scratched off , just like when you scratch off other areas on the card . <p> The Florida Lottery is phasing out the scratch-off code system . It is n't being used on any of the newer scratch-off ticket games . <p> John Szymonik contacted me , a bit upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is removing the codes to increase their profit . <p> Many of the games are confusing , Szymonik said , making it easy to misinterpret a winning card . He gave me an example of once playing a " bingo " instant lottery ticket that called for 20 scratches for four games on each card . He thought it was a loser but when looking at the code saw it indicated the scratch-off was a winner . <p> Szymonik said he could never figure out where he had a " bingo " on the card , but because he saw the code he did n't throw the ticket away . When he took it to a retailer , it was a $300 winner as the code showed . <p> Szymonik suspects the games are designed to be confusing so that people do n't realize they are winners . That way the lottery makes more money because people will buy the tickets but never claim the prize . <p> Some of the games do seem difficult to understand . As an example , here are the instructions for a $25 Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any of the winning numbers , win prize shown for that number . Get a ( 2X ) , ( 5X ) , ( 10X ) , ( 25X ) , ( 50X ) OR ( 100X ) symbol and multiply your prize shown for that symbol by that amount ! Get a ( $100 ) symbol , win $100 automatically . Get an ( ALL ) symbol , win all $25 prizes shown for that symbol ! " <p> I guess if you are n't reading carefully or do n't fully understand how to play , you might not know you 've won . But if you are a novice player , you might not know about codes either . <p> The lottery said the codes were printed on scratch-off tickets so retailers could validate them . That information is now embedded in the bar code . <p> There are many ways to determine if a ticket is a winner without knowing the code . After you buy a ticket and scratch it off you can get the ticket validated by : <p> Taking the ticket to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And there is no need to worry about getting cheated out of your lottery winnings if you sign the back of the ticket and print your name , address and phone number . Also , when you go to a retailer and the ticket is a winner , the machine plays a tune heralding the win . <p> So here 's what I think the people who play scratch-offs should do . Sign the tickets and take them to a retailer and see if they are winners before you throw them out . It 's simple enough and does n't take any deciphering of codes or complicated instructions . <p> If you suspect any shenanigans involving Florida Lottery tickets or vendors , contact the Office of the Inspector General online , by email , or by writing Office of the Inspector General c/o Florida Lottery , 250 Marriott Drive , Tallahassee , FL 32301.

@@97747465 @1947465/ <p> Note to our readers : Here are some of the best places recommended by The News-Press award-winning visuals journalist Andrew West on where to watch and photograph the November Supermoon , which will bring the moon the closest it has been to Earth in the last 70 years . <p> Buy Photo <p> Andrew West photographed the moon setting over the Sanibel Causeway in January of 2014 . ( Photo : Andrew West/The News-Press , Andrew West/ The News-Press ) <p> My recommendations for places to shoot from are finding a place with a local landmark to put the moon into context with it . <p> In this part of Florida that can be challenging . <p> First , because Southwest Florida does n't have hills or mountains there are n't many places to naturally climb and capture the Supermoon rising from an elevated location . <p> Second , Southwest Florida has limited options simply because of the fact we have fewer landmarks to shoot with the moon that- provide a contrasting foreground for the Supermoon as it rises . Some of the more famous examples of Supermoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberty in New York City , the Space Needle in Seattle and Big Ben in London . <p> Ideally , you will- have people in the frame , or some kind of subject ( like a building or bridge ) - to further enhance the contrast of the full moon rising . That is why those previously mentioned examples have been shared around the world as top examples . <p> Another tip as far as picking your location to shoot : know what time the Supermoon is expected to rise- so you can be set up and ready to go and shoot , shoot , shoot , - You do not want to be moving around very much as it is rising because the window of opportunity for a winning photo decreases as the Super Moon rises into the sky . <p> Here are some places and landmarks- I would recommend in Southwest Florida you can use to enhance your photography of the Super Moon . <p> 1 . The Sanibel Lighthouse : It is one of the most well known spots in Southwest Florida . You have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right juxtaposition because of where the moon rises . It would be best to shoot from boat . <p> 2 . Fort Myers Beach shrimp boats : The shrimp boats are one of my favorite places . I have photographed full moons from the other side of Matanzas Pass on Fort Myers Beach . <p> 3 . An open pasture : Think of the sprawling farm land east of Fort Myers . Look for a spot- with single large trees or a windmill on it that can be silhouetted as the moon rises behind it . <p> 4 . Sanibel Causeway : - This is a great landmark in Southwest Florida . Very striking . <p> 5 . Centennial Park : Look to use one of the- sculptures located in the park- for your- foreground . <p> 6 . Fish- houses in Pine Island Sound : - The fish houses are- one of the prettiest spots in Southwest Florida. - Similar to the Sanibel Lighthouse , I would recommend shooting from a boat . <p> 7 . Southwest Florida International Airport : An airplane taking off provides a unique foreground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west side of the property ( near the UPS and FedEx hubs ) that would provide an ideal place to try and capture this shot . <p> If you just want to get a photo and have nothing in front of it , you just need to find an open field or a rooftop on on a high-rise or a bridge ( there are many too choose from in Southwest Florida ! ) - Find a- spot where- you can see the horizon far off in the distance . An example would be from the top of the Mantanzas Bridge at Fort Myers Beach . This way you will be able to see it come up from the ground on the horizon . <p> Share your photos with me .

@@97747471 @1947471/ <h> What 's the best retirement advice you ever got ? <p> I never had the opportunity to get retirement advice from my dad . He died at 43 , when I was only 16 . He never even had a chance to experience retirement . I 've often wondered what he would have told me and my two brothers . <p> So , I talked to people from all walks of life from around the country over the past few months , and I put the same question to each of them : What was the best retirement advice you ever got , and who gave it to you ? Turns out the advice came from everywhere " moms , dads , teachers and even mentors . It 's all good solid advice that I 'm sure many of us would have loved to receive , specially when we were in our 20s . <p> Mike Jacobs , Alexandria , Va. , retired <p> My best retirement advice was from two people : <p> My first senior level manager at work in the 1970s , who told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can as early as you can . <p> My mom , who told me to invest in real estate ... " They are n't making any more land . " <p> The best retirement advice I ever got was from my father . He told me to open up a low- cost mutual fund account , like an index fund , and set it up to automatically invest money from my bank account and automatically reinvest the dividend . What happens is that you forget that it 's even there and depositing , but it 's growing on its own . Fast forward 10 to 20 years and you have a sizable investment . Without saying these words , he was teaching me the time value of money and the value of compound interest " two super retirement musts ! He has since passed away , but I thank my father for his wisdom and advice . #RIP . <p> When I got my first " real " job out of college , my boss told me two things . First , he told me to give up one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement account . That was an easy $50 . He showed me that by staying home one or two nights a month would make an enormous difference to me years later in retirement because of those compounding dollars . He also told me how important it was to make sure that I took advantage of " free money " my employers would give to me in terms of a matching contribution to my retirement plan . Even if you have to scale back , those contributions from your employer ca n't be replaced . I valued that advice , and still follow it to this day . <p> Whoever said it was the Golden Years lied , but it beats the alternative . Live each day with appreciation for what you have , and do n't worry so much over what you do n't have . <p> These were words of wisdom from Dr. Frank , who was one of my closest clients , a good friend , really . We spent a lot of time together discussing all aspects of life . His candid conversations opened a whole new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the not-so-good parts . He was born in 1919 , which places us nearly 50 years apart , yet we spoke as if we were peers . A retired dentist , he gave passionately back to his profession , a passion he instilled in me . His advice and guidance , which I still hear today , helps me frame and most importantly , re-frame my state of mind as well as my clients ' state of mind . <p> A piece of advice I developed from his wisdom and share with clients is , " It 's never too late until your view switches from the roses to the roots . " It 's not how you start , it 's how you finish . There are a lot of amazing individuals who accomplished great things later in life . Never give up a dream or ambition . This has been very helpful in the wake of the financial crisis , where some clients were literally starting over or recovering from " sudden retirement syndrome .

One client in particular worked a couple days of week at his own business and had a standing Wednesday-night meeting with friends for over four decades . As those friends began to pass away , we scheduled our client meetings over dinner on Wednesday evenings and continued to do so until his passing a few years ago . Retirement did n't mean that he retired from the life he had created during his working years . My successful retirees continue to make goals for themselves . One couple spent their travel time volunteering all over the world teaching English to other cultures and they continued this type of travel into their late 70s . Finally , the best advice that comes from those in their post-working years " live in the moment and appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the difference in my life came from my father . He worked as a mapmaker for the Army , but had a keen interest in the financial world . We were not a wealthy family , but he saved and invested and closely followed interest rate fluctuations and other financial news . <p> My father 's words of wisdom came not in the form of a pithy phrase , but in his regular discussions of money matters with me , even when I was just a young boy . His passion was clear . We talked about money at the dinner table . I have fond memories of joining him on occasional outings to buy government bonds . <p> He taught me the value of saving and the importance of having a financial plan . Most important , he showed me that building financial security is not just about the size of your paycheck , but about how you manage what you have . <p> Joe Heider , president at Cirrus Wealth Management , Cleveland <p> The best advice I got was from one of my first early career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to set up an investment strategy that you stick with even in good and bad times . It 's important to keep a long-term view and not to be overly reactive . <p> My father also passed along great advice and taught me the importance in picking a percentage of income to set aside , as though it becomes part of your monthly expenses . If you pick a set percentage , as income grows over time that strategy will continue to work for you no matter your income level . As income grows naturally your outflow will grow as well and therefore you will keep up with whatever your lifestyle is at retirement . <p> George Fraser , author and motivational speaker <p> I got some advice many years ago from an uncle who retired . He said to me , " George , do n't retire , unless you have something lined up that is more fulfilling , something that gives you greater joy and greater satisfaction . If you do n't have that lined up , do what you are doing . Do n't retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocking chair , you do n't ' want to watch TV . " <p> He said the worst thing I ever did was retire . I had no hobbies . I just thought I did n't want to do this work anymore , but I did n't have any other work . That 's the best advice I got . And the best advice I can give to anyone . The best advice I could give anyone who is thinking about " retirement " is to keep learning . Never stop learning . <p> When my wife and I were just starting out , in the early 1980s , our MetLife adviser " a nice fellow named Bill Foy " was a contemporary of ours and , like me , a native of the New York City area . Maybe his familiar accent helped his advice seem more welcome to me . Bill told us that we should put aside whatever we could , however small , into a 401(k) account , even if it seemed insignificant , using dollar cost averaging . In explaining that term to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing badly , we 're buying things on sale " when the market is doing well , we are buying a small piece of a successful stock . That has always been in mind , and seems to have helped us understand that every little bit helps . <p> Roger Crandall , MassMutual CEO : <p> The best retirement advice I can think of came from none other than Albert Einstein . He called compound interest the most powerful force in the universe . Starting early and reinvesting what you earn on your investments is the single best thing you can do . Sit down and look at what happens when you compound interest for 30 , 40 or 50 years . If people start young , no matter how small , and keep it up until they retire , the rest will take care of itself . <p> USA TODAY retirement columnist Rodney Brooks is the author of a new e-book , Is One Million Dollars Enough ?

Stallworth spent more than 21 hours , or about 12 percent of the time , outside the SOAR area and more than seven and a half hours , or nearly 4.5 percent of the time , at his home . <p> Over two days in February , he claimed 20 hours of regular pay but was at home , restaurants or a gas station for " extended periods of time " totaling more than five and a half hours , or more than a quarter of the time .

In the Moore case , the OIG found that from Jan. 15 , 2015 , through Feb. 6 , 2015 , he turned in 179 hours , including 32 hours of SOAR overtime and 6 hours of other overtime .

" They 're not sitting around in their pajamas and bedroom slippers and watching ' Captain Kangaroo .

Here are some of the offerings from popular hotel brands : Wyndham Hotel Group earlier this year partnered with Matrix by L'Oreal to bring new products to guests at the company 's midscale and economy brands . Wyndham Hotel Group <p> When designing guest rooms at the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City , choosing the right bathroom toiletries was just as important as choosing the right bedding . <p> " It 's a big deal if your bath amenity is bad , " says Jeff David , managing director of the Knickerbocker , a historic Times Square building that re-opened as a hotel in February 2015 . " It 's almost like buying a Mercedes and the stereo is bad . " <p> Toiletries used to be an afterthought for hotels .

That 's no longer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying to infuse personality into every aspect of the guest experience . The competition to provide amenities that will wow guests has turned fierce , and hoteliers say they are spending more time and effort to choose the right ones . <p> In addition to providing even more types of toiletries " think facial foam and makeup remover wipes " hotels are customizing toiletries or even teaming up with celebrities to lend their names to bathroom products . <p> " Every product , service or amenity a hotel provides impacts its branding , for better or for worse , " says Chekitan Dev , a marketing and branding expert at Cornell University 's School of Hotel Administration . " Bathroom amenities are typically not the reason a guest stays at a hotel but can play an important role in increasing satisfaction and repeat purchase . " <p> The factors that go into choosing toiletries can range from scent to bottle size to how eco-friendly they are to how well they appeal to different genders and age groups . <p> " The psychology of an amenity is really interesting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , the designers of the eco-conscious 1 Hotels chain- tried more than 100 brands of toiletries before deciding to create their own natural , paraben-free brand . <p> The product team at Comfort Inn and Comfort Suites looked at 20 to 30 options before they too developed their own proprietary brand called RAIO , says Anne Smith , vice president of brand strategy for parent company Choice Hotels . <p> Hilton Worldwide 's staff typically tries out 15 to 20 different brands of toiletries before landing on the right one , says Cindy Patton , the company 's senior director of product development . <p> Most of the hotel companies declined to disclose how much they spend on bathroom amenities , but Smith says a Comfort brand hotel may spend from $7,000 to $13,000 on bath amenities per year . David says the Knickerbocker spends about $5 per room a day on amenities . <p> Emilie Hoyt , founder and president of LATHER , a California skin care products line that has worked with hotels , says she wo n't offer discounts to lure clients .

" It 's a win-win . " <p> The demand is there . A survey conducted by Hilton found that 52% of travelers use their shower amenities . <p> " I think people are more in touch with well-branded luxury products and I think things can catch fire quicker through social media , " says Kemper Hyers , senior vice president of design for Starwood Capital Group , which developed the Baccarat Hotel in New York . " This makes great amenities a real plus for a hotel .

" When you 're away from home for that long , you want to use products that remind you of home or are more special than what you use every day . " <p> The types of toiletries a hotel offers sends a message about how it wants to be perceived , hoteliers say . <p> For instance , the Ritz-Carlton is an established luxury brand , so when it sought out a new line of bath amenities in 2012 , it went with Asprey , a British luxury goods house that dates back to 1781 . Guests get a package of Asprey Purple Water shampoo , shower gel , conditioner and body lotion along with soap , shaving and dental kits . They 've been so popular that guests commonly use one set of amenities per day , says Steven Holt , regional director of public relations for the Americas . <p> The Baccarat Hotel created its own line of toiletries , working with renowned French perfumer Francis Kurkdjian on the scent . <p> Ian Schrager , who developed the EDITION hotel in New York , wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So the hotel teamed with high-end perfumer Le Labo to create a custom scent for its toiletries . <p> At Conrad Hotels and Resorts , guests can customize their preferences for toiletries via the Conrad Concierge mobile app . Among the options are Shanghai Tang 's new line of Mandarin Tea products and vegan skincare products from Tara Smith Vegan Hair Care . <p> Much like they 've done with their restaurants , many high-end hotels now are teaming up with celebrities to create lines of amenities. - The Knickerbocker got celebrity hairstylist Ted Gibson to design its bath amenities. - Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts- has an exclusive partnership with fashion designer Salvatore Ferragamo . <p> Some hotels are concentrating more on the environmental impact of their toiletries . <p> Starwood Hotel and Resorts ' specialty select brands , which include Element and Four Points , have dispensers in every shower . Before settling on that , they considered many factors , including whether or not shower gels would pump out with ease . <p> " A lot of research went into making this decision and really the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispenser for their bath products ? " says Brian McGuinness , global brand leader of those brands . " Through trial , we found that they 're very amenable to it . " <p> When the toiletries are a hit , hoteliers say they are glad to see their guests take them home with them. - And in fact , many do. - Hilton 's recent survey showed that 73% of travelers leave with their bathroom amenities . More than 35% of business travelers said that they do . <p> " It 's a testament to the great guest experience delivered by the hotel when guests want to take a little part of that stay home with them , " Smith of Choice Hotels says .

The current program , which uses taxpayer money to help keep premiums to about 40 percent of actual cost through subsidies , is expected to be extended . <p> Lawmakers have extended the program in the past , and there is n't a short-term alternative . Florida 's two senators " Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Bill Nelson " are for reauthorization , so is U.S. Rep. Francis Rooney , who represents Lee and Collier counties .

Without reauthorization of the program and implementation of the subsidies , individual policies on secondary homes , as well as commercial properties , could increase 18 percent a year until actual rates are met . Subsidies for primary homes will remain . <p> Subsidies have always been a part of the NFIP . They were needed , especially in Southwest Florida , to keep older structures , built in compliance with elevation standards and building codes at the time , from paying astronomical rates as updated elevation standards and building codes from the early 1980s until 2008 took those structures out of compliance . <p> Approximately 20 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the full amount . <p> Skyrocketing flood insurance rates are nothing new . When changes were made to the program about five years ago in an attempt to eliminate the subsidies , under Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act , rates zoomed off the charts . Homeowners in Florida saw premiums climb from $1,000 to $23,000 , in some cases , especially in coastal communities . <p> To calm the alarming increases brought on by Biggert-Waters , the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 was passed to put a cap on how much rates could increase annually . <p> Insuring the risky <p> Florida policyholders " and there are 1.7 million - account for 27 percent of all the annual NFIP premiums .

As the primary provider of inpatient care ( in Lee County ) we have a responsibility to be able to provide that . <p> " That requires the amount of capital spending that we 've been doing and will continue to do for the next three to five years . " <p> Q : So , is the need for more hospitals or more outpatient expansion ? <p> A : " I think it 's going to be both . There 's going to be a considerable need for more beds in next five to 10 years . But when you layer upon that the ways we're- trying to reduce hospital admissions ( through more preventative and outpatient services ) that will be mitigated considerably . <p> " We really want to keep people out of the hospital , and when they 're in the hospital try to get them home quicker . " <p> Q : What else do you want to tell the community ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's best for this community .

The researchers are married . ( Photo : Andrew West/The News-Press ) Buy Photo <p> When there is a mosquito-borne virus outbreak in Florida , there is a chance Scott Michael and Sharon Isern will get a call about it . <p> Michael and Isern are husband and wife , and they are researchers and professors at Florida Gulf Coast University . The virologists have worked at FGCU since 2004 and are known in Florida and beyond for their work related to mosquito-borne viruses . <p> The researchers have used their expertise when asked over the years to conduct tests for mosquito-borne viruses , including when there were dengue outbreaks in the Florida Keys , Martin- County and the Miami-Dade area . Last year , they were sought out when Florida was being hit with cases of Zika . <p> Michael and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a breakthrough when it comes to preventing and treating it . They received a $1.7 million National Institutes of Health grant to help with developing a dengue vaccine , and they have licensed a dengue antiviral treatment to a company for further development . <p> Their latest research , the result of work with a team of international scientists , focused on the 2016 Zika outbreak in Florida that was of particular concern in Miami-Dade . The- research , published in May in- Nature , a preeminent science journal , shows Zika was- in Florida before its first clinical diagnosis , and it was introduced into the state at least four times . <p> " We work with infectious diseases that are major human pathogens , so our entire intent is not to be known for what we do but rather to put ourselves out of business , " Michael said . <p> Bob Gregerson , dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at FGCU , said the research Michael and Isern have produced sets a high bar for other researchers at the university . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nature , " he said . " It 's just very unusual , and that speaks volumes about the quality of their research . " <p> Michael and Isern have offices down the hall from each other on the third floor of FGCU 's Seidler Hall . In addition to doing research in a laboratory there , their responsibilities include training and teaching undergraduate students who want to be scientists and researchers . <p> " This is what we do for our jobs and for our hobby , " Michael said . " It 's not that we do n't do anything else and have absolutely no fun . But this is the kind of a job " - being a professor consumes your life . It 's a passion . " <p> Last year , the Miami-Dade Mosquito Control District reached out to the researchers and asked if they were going to do any Zika testing . They started conducting tests on mosquitoes in about June and continued to do so until sometime in August . <p> " There were so many coming in that there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mosquitoes from throughout the state because Zika was such a big deal , " Isern said . <p> The virologists had a bunch of questions about last year 's Zika outbreak and set out to answer- them with their team that included FGCU students . <p> The researchers found : - <p> GThe first clinical diagnosis of Zika was in July , but the researchers believe- it was in the state as early as spring 2016 . <p> GThere were at least four and as many as 40 introductions of the virus into the state . The researchers found four versions of Zika persisted in the state while the others did not . <p> GThe scientists traced three of the four Zika virus ' origins to the Caribbean and the other to Central America. - <p> GOnce here , each virus stayed active about 100 days before fizzling out . <p> " There are a number of different ways that Zika could be getting here , " Michael said . " So people wonder whether it 's brought on by infected mosquitoes or by infected people , and either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> State officials already have started a campaign , warning Florida 's residents that the state is at risk for another Zika outbreak this summer . <p> Zika can be spread through the bites of infected mosquitoes , sexual intercourse and blood transfusions. - <p> Those infected with the- virus can show symptoms , including a mild fever and red eye , or none at all. - <p> The biggest concern about the virus is it has been linked to the birth defect Microcephaly when contracted by pregnant mothers . <p> Isern said she , too , thinks Zika will be a problem for Florida again this summer , with travelers to tropical and subtropical destinations being infected by- mosquitoes , bringing the virus back to the state and possibly starting a transmission chain. - <p> The other concern Isern said is mosquitoes that were infected with the virus last year passing it on to the offsprings in their eggs . <p> " When it starts to rain , they will hatch , " she said . " So there will be Zika infected mosquitoes that can start the transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus in 2016 , - according to Florida Department of Health statistics. - <p> As of Thursday , 71 cases of infections had been reported this year , the statistics show. - <h> Love and science <p> Michael and Isern met in 1988 at John Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland . <p> Isern was a senior pursuing her undergraduate degree in chemical engineering , and Michael was a third-year graduate student working on earning his doctorate in chemistry . <p> " He crashed a chemical engineering picnic and that was that , " Isern said . <p> Michael and Isern married in 1990 . <p> As Isern pursued a doctorate degree , first at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and then at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , Michael did postdoctoral fellowships at the schools . <p> At the time , Michael was interested in HIV research . <p> Michael said once HIV started to be considered a treatable disease rather than a death sentence , he switched his research interest to dengue . <p> " So I am like , ' OK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that kills lots of people , babies , and has the largest impact of any mosquito-transmitted virus in the world , " ' he said . <p> Isern critically critiques Michael 's ideas , and she provides the visual creativity " - think illustrations - " they include in their work . <p> " In terms of working together on science , she 's an amazing experimentalist , " Michael said . " She can design experiments to tell you the results for real " the truth and not what it is that you want to see . "
