With this package highly realistic water effects and avalanches were created offline , recorded as Bink videos , and dynamically merged into real-time cutscenes to display visual effects that would be otherwise impossible to render . Less accurate effects could be rendered in real-time , though they would n't appear anywhere near as dramatic or thrilling . <p> As well as those enhancements , the PC release of Rise of the Tomb Raider also sees several game settings improved with new features and functionality , and the addition of entirely new settings . Not to mention the option to utilize NVIDIA technologies like DSR , G-SYNC , SLI , and Surround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those effects in our screenshots as we examine Rise of the Tomb Raider 's many settings and PC-only upgrades . We 'll also show comparisons that highlight their benefits , and reveal their relative performance cost at 1920x1080 , the most popular PC gaming resolution . Furthermore , we 'll reveal the GPUs you require for a max setting experience , and demonstrate how NVIDIA technologies can enhance your time in Rise of the Tomb Raider 's stunning environments . <p> This being the PC , you can of course crank many of the settings to Very High , bolstering graphical fidelity that bit further . To discover the system you 'll require for a maxed out experience skip to our settings summary . <p> Rise of the Tomb Raider PC-Exclusive Graphics Enhancements <p> As is the case with the vast majority of multi-platform titles , Rise of the Tomb Raider looks even better on PC thanks to graphics settings that can run at higher detail levels . In addition , there 's a new game-wide application of tessellation , a new shadow setting that applies realistic softening , supersampling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Combined , the PC-exclusive options and other enhancements increase fidelity far beyond the level seen on other platforms , delivering the definitive Rise of the Tomb Raider experience . <p> For detailed explanations of every enhancement , and demonstrations of their capabilities , keep reading . For a first look , check out our Rise of the Tomb Raider Tech Trailer below : <p> Ambient Occlusion <p> Ambient Occlusion ( AO ) adds contact shadows where two surfaces or objects meet , and where an object blocks light from reaching another nearby game element . The AO technique used and the quality of the implementation affects the shadowing 's accuracy , and whether new shadows are formed when the level of occlusion is low . Without Ambient Occlusion scenes look flat and unrealistic , and objects appear as if they are floating . <p> BTAO , seen originally in the Xbox One edition of the game and further tweaked for this PC release , is inspired by a 2012 AO technique called Scalable Ambient Obscurance ( SAO ) . Microsoft built upon the ideas presented in the linked SAO paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customize it for Rise of the Tomb Raider . The result is a technique that is better and faster than Horizon Based Ambient Occlusion ( HBAO ) , which we developed back in 2008 . <p> In 2013 however we improved upon every aspect of HBAO to create HBAO+ , and now in 2016 the latest iteration of HBAO+ is found in Rise of the Tomb Raider , creating richer , deeper , more accurate ambient occlusion shadows that further bolster the visual fidelity of the game 's fantastic graphics . <p> As you can see in our interactive comparisons below HBAO+ brings out every detail of every surface , and helps reveal the depth and detail added by the PC-exclusive surface tessellation , which enhances objects , walls and floors throughout the game with small bumps , cracks , ridges , and other flourishes . <p> Here we see how HBAO+ 's accuracy enables all the folds in the tent 's cloth to be seen , as well as a general improvement to the accuracy of ambient occlusion shadowing on and around other objects and surfaces . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occlusion technique improves upon BTAO , which is itself rather good . With HBAO+ , AO shadowing is improved , entirely new shadows are rendered , and detail has even greater depth and realism , with the smallest of details being accurately shadowed . <p> Performance : The cost of Ambient Occlusion in Rise of the Tomb Raider can vary from scene to scene , especially in the early parts of the game . In the larger hub areas and later story sequences the cost of BTAO is around two frames per second , and HBAO+ a few frames per second more . <p> Given the immense improvement to image quality , HBAO+ is recommended for all but the slowest systems . <p> Anisotropic Filter <p> Texture Filtering , Anisotropic Filtering , and other similarly named options affect the sharpness of textures , especially those seen in the distance , on oblique angles , or on the sides of the screen . Without Texture Filtering surfaces appear blurry , and image quality is significantly degraded . <p> In Rise of the Tomb Raider players can choose between several Anisotropic detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Performance : Anisotropic Filtering has a negligible performance cost on PC , with the delta being just 1.2 frames per second between 2x and 16x . Trilinear Filtering does give you a significant speed-up , but no sane person should select the option unless they wish for the complete loss of texture fidelity game-wide . <p> Anti-Aliasing <p> The main anti-aliasing option in Rise of the Tomb Raider is FXAA , a fast post-process solution that anti-aliases edges and transparencies to a decent degree . It may not be to everyone 's taste , because of texture blur and the introduction of temporal aliasing , but typically in modern games traditional Multisample Anti-Aliasing ( MSAA ) techniques are either incompatible or too demanding . Those seeking an alternative can try Rise of the Tomb Raider 's other anti-aliasing option , Supersampling Anti-Aliasing ( SSAA ) . <p> SSAA acts much like NVIDIA Dynamic Super Resolution , increasing the internal rendering resolution of the game before downsampling the result to the display 's screen resolution . On a 1920x1080 monitor , 2x SSAA renders Rise of the Tomb Raider at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output has significantly more detail per pixel , increasing the quality of texturing , the fidelity of effects , and the visibility of background detail . And aliasing is all but eliminated , delivering a super high-quality picture . <p> Of course , the performance cost is immense , as it would be when rendering natively at a higher resolution on a high-resolution monitor , or using Dynamic Super Resolution to boost the rendering resolution . If you have the horsepower though you can combine SSAA with higher rendering resolutions to output at an effective 7680x4320 , which is how DeadEndThrills produced these stunning screenshots . <p> As the following comparisons hopefully demonstrate , FXAA often has little affect on aliasing in Rise of the Tomb Raider at 1920x1080 , and while SSAA can improve image quality by a significant degree , downsampling with NVIDIA Dynamic Super Resolution offers greatly flexibility . Compared to SSAA , which essentially offers two resolutions to downsample from , NVIDIA Dynamic Super Resolution gives you seven , plus the ability to utilize in-game or out of game post process options . This enables greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior picture quality . <p> In many of the caverns and tombs , FXAA anti-aliasing has minimal impact on image quality , bar the slight-to-moderate blurring of detail , which is especially noticeable on specular effects in this example . <p> Thanks to the Dynamic Foliage setting , almost all of the game 's foliage sways and blows in the wind , making temporal aliasing a particular issue at 1920x1080 . If you can , boost the resolution or inject a superior post-process anti-aliasing technique . <p> January 29th , 2016 Update : The launch-day build of the game added a SMAA post-process anti-aliasing mode . As you can see in the comparisons below it leaves many surfaces and edges aliased , and in some cases fails to anti-alias them whatsoever , but it does at least avoid FXAA 's blurring of textures . Also included in the new set of comparisons is a look at an alternative SMAA technique that is injected into the game via a tool called ReShade . Popular with many enthusiasts , ReShade enables the alteration of a game 's appearance through a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-aliasing and ambient occlusion solutions , often producing better results than the in-game settings . <p> As the comparisons demonstrate , ReShade 's injectable post-process SMAA is the best post-process anti-aliasing solution for Rise of the Tomb Raider . It anti-aliases edges far better than SMAA , as is particularly evident on the laptop , desk and lamp , and does n't blur textures like FXAA . <p> Setting ReShade SMAA up is pretty simple : download the ReShade app , extract the archive , open Mediator.exe , follow the steps in the readme to add Rise of the Tomb Raider , click on the " Pipeline " tab , untick everything other " SMAA - SweetFX " , click " Apply " , switch back to the " Setup " tab , save or update your preset , and click " Permanent Push To Application " . Now start Rise of the Tomb Raider , configure your options in the launcher to disable anti-aliasing , and load the game . If you 've done everything correctly you 'll see some ReShade info on the top left of the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our screenshots . <p> You can then tweak the SMAA options in Mediator on the SweetFX &gt; SMAA tab , and make further changes to the game 's appearance through the many other included options . Alternatively , download other people 's ReShade profiles from here . <p> Performance : As detailed earlier , SSAA can have a significant performance cost , similar to the cost of increasing the rendering resolution . That turns out to be 13 FPS for 2x SSAA , and 21 FPS for 4x SSAA , which pushes our reference-speed GeForce GTX 980 Ti below 30 FPS . If you have a SLI setup though , SSAA is a viable option . The newly-added SMAA , meanwhile , runs about a frame per second slower than FXAA , despite its poor coverage . And ReShade SMAA is that bit slower , though definitely worth it in our opinion . <p> Our recommendation stands following the update : use ReShade SMAA if you dislike FXAA , or better yet downsample with NVIDIA DSR and add a post-process solution on top , be that FXAA , SMAA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights and adds some fringes of light , but here in Rise of the Tomb Raider its integral to the look of scenes , emphasising tunnels , items of interest , transitions to exterior locations , and more . <p> In addition , HDR and adaptive tone mapping are utilised in concert to bolster the fidelity of what we ordinarily see from a Bloom effect , making it a must-have setting in Rise of the Tomb Raider . <p> Thanks to the inclusion of Screen Space Reflections , Bloom and HDR lighting is reflected on bodies of water and other suitably reflective surfaces , too . <p> Performance : Being a post-process effect Bloom costs just a single frame per second in the overwhelming majority of locations . <p> Depth of Field <p> Depth of Field is prevalently used for cinematic effect in Rise of the Tomb Raider , helping enhance moments of action and drama . <p> In cutscenes , variable focus depth of field is utilised , with Bokeh applied to out of focus shapes and particles , imparting a cinematic appearance on these professionally-acted segments of story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , typically minutes-long cutscenes , ' Very High ' Depth of Field is fully utilised even when the lower-quality ' On ' setting is selected in the graphics menu . <p> In shorter cutscenes that transition into and out of gameplay , ' Very High ' applies the full Bokeh treatment as before , while ' On ' applies a less precise blur lacking Bokeh . <p> Below , we highlight a spoiler-free moment from a " cinematic " , which features identical Depth of Field blurring and Bokeh effects regardless of the setting chosen in the menu . <p> During gameplay , depth of field is applied selectively to distant game elements , when diving underwater , during blizzards , in other scripted moments , and screen-wide when activating Lara 's Survival Instinct ability that highlights items of note in the environment . <p> Using the ' On ' setting , depth of field is visible during many of these scenarios , albeit at a lower quality with less blurring , and without Bokeh . Using ' Very High ' , max quality " cinematic " depth of field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the edge of the screen , to the occasional distant building or landmark , underwater , during blizzards , and in Instinct mode on all game elements . <p> Below a dramatic gameplay scene does a particularly good job at demonstrating the differences between the detail levels . <p> Similarly , blizzards also receive the Very High treatment , creating a real sense of limited visibility from the storm raging around Lara . With ' On ' , a slight blur can be seen if you enhance the pixels in Photoshop . <p> Performance : Depending on whether it 's a gameplay scene , cutscene or cinematic , and the amount of action occurring , Very High Depth of Field costs between three and seven frames per second . <p> If you 've got the performance to spare , Very High will greatly increase the fidelity of the game 's often-stunning cutscenes , and will slightly improve fidelity during general gameplay . <p> Dynamic Foliage <p> On Xbox One the occasional larger piece of foliage could be affected by the movement of Lara , and by the weather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the density of foliage has been increased , too , making for a more realistic and immersive environment . <p> With the ' High ' setting selected , foliage sways in the wind , and bends and parts as Lara , enemies and larger animals traverse through the environment . See it in action at 02:40 in the Rise of the Tomb Raider tech vid : <p> Lower detail levels reduce the amount of interactive foliage and also decrease the density and detail levels of foliage , especially so on Low , which we recommend avoiding unless you 're in dire need of performance . <p> Performance : Lens Flares have a minimal cost , albeit one that 's a smidge higher than other post-process settings in the game . <p> Level of Detail <p> As you 'd expect , the Level of Detail setting adjusts the quality and visibility of game elements at medium and long ranges to improve performance on slower systems . Per Nixxes Software , the studio that created the PC version , " for specific cases where large areas are replaced with low-res placeholder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent these areas with higher fidelity content , even when the full content is streamed out . " This allows performance to be increased without completely removing all detail , which would otherwise leave a void in the scene . <p> In addition , Level of Detail can affect the visibility of lighting effects , visual effects and shadows , most noticeably on Medium and Low . <p> At close range some detail can be scaled back , and the occasional shadow removed . Note also the steps-slash-shelves above the water in the center of the picture - skulls , bones and other remains are removed in favour of general debris , an example of the mesh replacement mentioned by Nixxes Software . <p> Across wider views geometry is scaled back , additional detail removed , and forests thinned out , though never is the overall draw distance affected ; you can always find your way from A to B by following the always-visible landmarks . <p> Performance : Adjusting the level of detail can be particularly beneficial in scenes featuring numerous lights , visual effects , and shadows affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time the gain from switching to Low from Very High is only around six to seven frames per second . <p> PureHair <p> PureHair is Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix 's hair rendering technology , which like our own HairWorks technology adds tens of thousands of hair strands to a character model . These hairs act realistically , swaying and moving in concert with character movement , and can be affected by water , wind and snow , and are lit and shaded in real-time by the scene . <p> In Rise of the Tomb Raider , up to 30,000 strands of hair are applied solely to Lara , with large groups of hairs controlled by master strands that dictate their movement and properties , preventing each individual hair strand from acting independently , and keeping physics calculation costs in check . <p> In-game , three options are on offer : ' Off ' disables PureHair entirely , adding approximated hair rendering in its place ; ' On ' is the recommended detail level for most players , with a good amount of hairs visible and full physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds cinematic-quality PureHair to every moment of the game , increasing hair strand counts to 30,000 in close-ups . <p> And as with the previously-discussed Depth of Field effects , ' Very High ' hair is rendered during longer cinematics even if ' On ' is your selected setting . <p> During gameplay the difference between the two PureHair settings is tough to spot , especially when you can only see the back of Lara 's head unless you manually turn the camera . In the two sets of comparisons below , note the thicker hair and the additional strands of hair near the hood of her jacket . <p> Other humans as well as animals and fur-lined coats are comprised of alpha textures , placed onto " Alpha Cards " as individual clumps of hair . These can then be positioned and layered on a model or asset to create high-fidelity hair and fur , albeit without the dynamic movement of Lara 's PureHair . The developer images below take you through the process . <p> Performance : As with other hair rendering technologies dynamic level of detail scaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly . During gameplay , Lara 's hair costs between 4 and 8 frames per second depending on the camera 's position , up to 12 frames per second when the camera goes in for a close-up , and between 14 and 20 frames per second during cutscenes and cinematics . <p> If you can afford the cost , enabling PureHair increases the realism and fidelity of Lara 's hair as she runs , jumps and blasts her way through Rise of the Tomb Raider . If not , the look of the basic hair is OK , and there is a basic level of approximated movement . For most though , ' On ' is the recommended level , adding realistic hair at a minimal performance cost during gameplay . <p> Screen Effects <p> Blood , hexagonal flares , dirt , snow , and other effects can appear on-screen with this setting enabled . Compared to Tomb Raider 2013 , these effects fade and fall from the screen faster , and are only brightly lit when a light source is shining directly at the the game 's virtual camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's surfaces can reflect the world around them , improving fidelity greatly or subtly depending on the reflectivity of the surface in question . Most visibly , bodies of water reflect their surroundings , enhancing image quality greatly . <p> Without Screen Space Reflections the muddier water of the game can look particularly flat and dull , decreasing image quality and immersion . <p> Screen Space Reflections are visible throughout the game , though sometimes only for a split second . <p> Performance : Screen Space Reflections often cost a significant number of frames per second , though in this case we 're looking at just a few frames per second thanks to an efficient implementation from Crystal Dynamics and Nixxes . <p> Specular Reflection Quality <p> Specular Reflection Quality was introduced with the first Rise of the Tomb Raider update . As the name suggests it affects the quality of specular reflections , which can be found on floors , walls and other surfaces and objects throughout the game . Note however that larger bodies of water , like those shown in our interactive comparisons in the Screen Space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run at max quality at all times . <p> Many applications of Specular Reflections are subtle within Rise of the Tomb Raider , naturally enhancing the quality of a scene through the addition of glimmer and other small details you ordinarily would n't pay attention to . On occasion though a larger puddle of water will be seen with enough surface area to clearly reflect details in the environment . <p> It is on these larger wet surfaces that the impact of the new setting is particularly evident . With Very High , reflected detail is significantly clearer , and in-motion flickers and shimmers far less , bolstering image quality . On High , the value enabled in previous versions of the game , reflection quality is reduced , and aliasing introduced from the blending of the lower-resolution specular reflection with the full-resolution scene . Furthermore , foliage and other transparencies blended with the lower-resolution specular reflections can see their fidelity decreased as well , reducing clarity and detail by a fair degree . <p> In the interactive comparisons below , note the clarity of the foliage reflection , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detail of leafy foliage , the addition of aliasing around the cobblestones , the higher degree of aliasing on foliage , and the addition of aliasing on the building 's porch next to " Reload Checkpoint " . <p> At higher resolutions the impact of Specular Reflection Quality is less pronounced , though those with an eagle eye will spot the loss of fidelity on Lara 's bow next to the second arrow 's feather , as well as the aforementioned issues . <p> At 4K we also see the impact on specular-enhanced terrain when the Specular Reflection Quality is decreased . <p> Performance : Surfaces with Screen Space Reflections are far more noticeable in Rise of the Tomb Raider , but it is the surfaces with Specular Reflections that are in fact more pervasive , subtly enhancing many scenes , and clearly enhancing others . It should come as no surprise then that Specular Reflections can have a greater impact on performance , and have this impact far more frequently . <p> With this new Specular Reflection Quality setting players can now improve graphical fidelity beyond the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or increase performance by lowering the it to ' On ' , from ' High ' . <p> Shadow Quality <p> As the name suggests , Shadow Quality adjusts the quality of shadows . There 's nothing particularly exciting to add , as the setting merely adjusts the shadow map size . In other words , the resolution and detail of shadows . <p> On High , the second best setting , some shadow definition is lost on finer details , like the chain link fence and leaves shown in examples below , and temporal instability begins to creep in . On Medium this is particularly evident , with dynamic shadows flickering heavily as they move . <p> Off , meanwhile , is only for the slowest of systems , completely removing dynamic shadows , and removing the vast majority of other shadows , too . The loss of fidelity is immense , especially in outdoor daytime environments where shadows ordinarily cast by trees and other objects are entirely missing . <p> Performance : If you 've got performance to spare , setting Shadow Quality to High will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , set Shadow Quality to Very High to maximize the fidelity of the many shadows seen during gameplay , and to further increase fidelity when using the Sun Soft Shadows setting detailed below . <p> Sun Soft Shadows <p> A supplementary shadow setting , Sun Soft Shadows naturally softens shadows cast as a result of sunlight . Typically this results in the softening of foliage shadows , though other shadows can also benefit , though not as noticeably . <p> Because Sun Soft Shadows is enhancing already-cast shadows , the quality and efficacy of this effect changes with your Shadow Quality setting . For instance , Very High Shadow Quality and Sun Soft Shadows Very High results in clearly defined leaves that are softened , removing the unnaturally sharp shadows that you simply do n't see in reality . <p> Decreasing Shadow Quality , meanwhile , decreases the clarity and detail level of said leaves , and so softening smudges the shadow . This does however mask the low-res appearance of said shadows , and helps combat the flickering that can occur . <p> The first half of Lara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other snowy regions . To depict her travels through these snow-filled environments adaptive level of detail tessellation is employed , creating realistic snow tracks as Lara , characters and animals move through the environment . <p> The result is a more accurate and detailed implementation that creates tracks of varying depth and width based on the movement and action of characters . And as with the Arkham Origins technique , ambient occlusion shadowing is accurately applied , further increasing the fidelity of the effect . <p> Without tessellation enabled in-game , some snow deformation is still rendered in select scenes where the effect is crucial to the story . For instance , when Lara is tumbling and trudging through waist-high snow . In areas with only a light coating , the adaptive tessellation technology is disabled and basic footstep imprints rendered instead . <p> Elsewhere in the PC edition of Rise of the Tomb Raider , new PC-only tessellation enhances the geometric detail of many surfaces and objects throughout the game . Floors , walls , statues , trees , destructible barriers , climbable surfaces , and other game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of detail . Moreover , the added geometric detail is realistically shadowed by your selected Ambient Occlusion technique , and bends shadows cast upon them , subtly enhancing the appearance of innumerable scenes and surfaces for the duration of your time with Rise of the Tomb Raider . <p> Some applications of tessellation are extremely subtle , but not this one . <p> Examples of tessellation can be found in virtually every scene , further improving PC image quality . Here , the climbable rock face is enhanced , enabling shadows and Ambient Occlusion shadowing to be applied realistically . <p> In the first hub area , which is predominately covered by snow , ground tessellation can be fairly sparse . <p> Later areas , as well as tombs and cliffs , feature many more enhanced surfaces and objects , improving the image quality of just about everything . <p> Performance : With a Maxwell GeForce GTX 900 Series graphics card , which crunches tessellation tasks up to three times faster than previous-generation NVIDIA GPUs , Rise of the Tomb Raider 's tessellation costs around four frames per second . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may go unnoticed as you charge through the game 's environments . As such , if you 're in need of extra performance you can safely disable it without harming image quality too significantly . Those who can enable the extra tessellation will bolster image quality that bit further . <p> Texture Quality <p> Unsurprisingly , Texture Quality adjusts the clarity and quality of textures game wide , and in Rise of the Tomb Raider four detail levels are on offer . <p> From our comparisons and over 16 hours of gameplay and testing , we can confidently state that the difference between Very High and High is minimal in most scenes , with only the occasional object or surface suffering a noticeable loss of detail . Below High , the level found on consoles , detail and clarity does decrease across each scene , with barely any surface untouched . <p> On Lara , close-ups expose the gulf in image quality between High and Medium , and reveal one of the few textures that benefits greatly from the Very High setting . <p> If you look closely there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this scene , starting with the generator on the bottom left of the picture ; on the large wall we see more detailed markings from the freezing and thawing of water and ice , with Very High enabled . <p> Those with 4GB GPUs are recommended to use High as VRAM stuttering can be observed on Very High , especially when swapping between gameplay , cutscenes and cinematics , and between gameplay zone transitions . <p> For a smooth experience with those max-quality , 4K x 4K textures , a 6GB GPU is instead recommended . And to crank things up to 4K ( 3840x2160 ) , with Very High textures and max settings , we 'd recommended GeForce GTX TITAN X GPUs with 12GB of VRAM , as usage can near 10GB over prolonged sessions . <p> Performance : As you 'd expect , adjusting Texture Quality has a minimal impact on performance , with only two frames per second separating Very High and Low . <p> Vignette Blur <p> An extremely subtle effect , Vignette Blur slightly blurs the corners of the screen in select scenes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconsciousness , or the surroundings are scorching hot from a fire , for example . <p> Performance : Given the subtlety of this post-process effect you 'll be unsurprised to learn that it costs less than 1 frame per second . <p> Settings Wrap-Up <p> As you 've likely gathered by now Rise of the Tomb Raider can be extremely demanding when every setting is maxed out . You do n't have to run at max settings , but many an enthusiast desires that definitive level of detail . So for those that want to know , here is the GeForce GTX 900 Series benchmarked at three of the most popular resolutions , with max settings and FXAA Anti-Aliasing enabled : <p> Click to enlarge <p> In our demanding scene that makes full use of the game 's settings , performance is bottlenecked at 1920x1080 , with only 8-10 frames per second being gained on our fastest GPUs when run in SLI . Other scenes run significantly faster , but this location half-way through the game better represents performance in many of the game 's scenes and areas , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference-speed graphics cards we pushed through the 60 FPS barrier , and with CPU overclocking , custom GPU coolers ( as found on almost all graphics cards ) , and the higher clock speeds that accompany said coolers , we 're sure performance would be far higher for you at home . <p> For max setting 4K gameplay , meanwhile , you 're going to need the best of the best , and maybe even a 3-Way SLI configuration , which is supported by the SLI profile in our new Rise of the Tomb Raider Game Ready driver . <p> If you want to improve performance , consider dialing Depth of Field and PureHair down to ' On ' from ' Very High ' , disabling tessellation , and taking Dynamic Foliage and Shadow Quality down a notch . The differences can be observed in the static screenshots found on this page , but during gameplay you 're far less likely to notice , especially if you 're a game who has Motion Blur enabled and makes constant use of the Sprint button . <p> NVIDIA Dynamic Super Resolution <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activate Dynamic Super Resolution ( DSR ) to receive up to 4K-quality graphics on your HD monitor . How it works is simple : compatible games , such as Rise of the Tomb Raider , are rendered at a higher , more detailed resolution , and the image intelligently shrunk back down to the resolution of your monitor using a custom-made filter , giving you up to 4K-quality graphics on your screen . The video below explains more , and the images show how to activate the setting in the NVIDIA Control Panel . <p> With DSR enabled , textures benefit from improved clarity , aliasing is further reduced , objects have better definition , vegetation is more detailed , and distant game elements are clearer . If you 've used DSR in other games you 'll know of these benefits already , but if you have n't had the chance here 's a look at how Rise of the Tomb Raider 's graphics scale with rendering resolutions . <p> Performance : Using a reference GeForce GTX 980 Ti , the DSR rendering resolution was increased in a benchmark that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding moments . <p> And with SLI enabled , here 's a second set of results . <p> If you 've got the hardware , and dial back the detail of high-cost settings by a single notch , a 4K experience can be attained on SLI configurations .

And to close , we 'll look at overall performance on our range of GPUs , revealing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every setting . <p> To start , check out some Gears of War 4 3840x2160 4K gameplay captured on a GeForce GTX 1080 , in a pre-release build , meaning it looks even better now . <p> With so many graphics settings Gears of War 4 can be configured to run on almost all DirectX 12-capable GPUs , including the venerable GeForce GTX 750 Ti , which runs at around 45 frames per second , on average , at 1920x1080 , with a mix of medium and low settings . However , playing with settings turned down does a disservice to the game The Coalition has crafted , so Microsoft is recommending gamers experience Gears of War 4 with a GeForce GTX 970 or GeForce GTX 1060 , or a GeForce GTX 1080 if an Ultra-setting 3840x2160 4K experience is desired . <p> Gears of War 4 's 30-plus graphics settings have over 100 options , though in the interests of time some options are grouped together in our guide . Below we 've thoroughly examined each setting and option , demonstrating their image quality with interactive screenshot comparisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the conclusion of the guide we 've tested overall performance with Ultra and Insane settings to reveal the level of performance required to max out Gears of War 4 . <p> Ambient Occlusion Quality <p> Ambient Occlusion ( AO ) adds contact shadows where two surfaces or objects meet , and where an object blocks light from reaching another nearby game element . The AO technique used and the quality of the implementation affects the shadowing 's accuracy , and whether new shadows are formed when the level of occlusion is low . Without Ambient Occlusion scenes look flat and unrealistic , and objects appear as if they 're floating . <p> In Gears of War 4 , the Ambient Occlusion option enables players to choose from three increasingly-better versions of The Coalition 's customised Screen Space Ambient Occlusion ( SSAO ) technique , and with the " Ambient Occlusion Intensity " slider adjust the amount of AO rendered . <p> First , let 's take a look at the Quality settings at default levels of Intensity : <p> As you 'd expect , AO effects are more accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater impact across scenes with longer view distances . And by raising the Ambient Occlusion Intensity from +7 , we can increase the minimum amount of AO rendered : <p> In other locations +15 is far too high , so we recommend leaving this setting at the +7 default . <p> Performance : The Coalition 's SSAO implementation has a fairly light touch on Medium and High , costing 2 frames per second at most . On Ultra that raises to 6 FPS , which may be a smidge too high for some systems . <p> As for Ambient Occlusion Intensity , it has no impact on performance whatsoever . <p> Anti-Aliasing Quality <p> Temporal Anti-Aliasing ( TAA ) is employed at all times in Gears of War 4 to reduce aliasing screen-wide , and to counteract the shimmering and flickering of anti-aliased edges when the camera or player 's viewpoint is in motion , or when game elements in the scene are moving . For example , as each tree , branch , leaf , and blade of grass sways in the wind in an early scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminishing the quality of the picture . <p> In Gears of War 4 , four detail levels are aptly on offer , each reducing the degree of aliasing , and improving the quality of the Temporal Anti-Aliasing . In interactive comparisons and screenshots , edge aliasing improvements are extremely difficult to discern ; in motion , higher settings reduce dithering and blurring seen on moving game elements at 1920x1080 . <p> If the Scaled Resolution is increased to 2560x1440 or higher on a 1920x1080 monitor , Medium delivers a sufficient level of anti-aliasing and temporal anti-aliasing , without the highly noticeable dithering and blurring . Though to completely counter the issue , Anti-Aliasing Quality needs to be raised to at least High . <p> In addition , the game 's anti-aliasing slightly blurs the scene , as do all forms of post-process anti-aliasing . To negate this problem the Scaled Resolution setting can be employed for DSR-style Downsampling , or Sharpening can be activated . As you 'll see in its dedicated section later , Sharpening applies post-process , Photoshop-style techniques to artificially improve clarity , at the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible aliasing from applying Sharpening , or from simply using a lower screen or render resolution , the " Temporal AA Sharpening " option can be activated . This increases the efficacy of temporal anti-aliasing , but increases edge aliasing on geometry and objects that are n't moving when the camera is static . <p> In the interactive comparisons below you observe this occurring on the flag and window , which respectively look better and worse when the level of Temporal AA Sharpening is increased . <p> Performance : Given the very low cost of the game 's Anti-Aliasing ( 0.3 FPS separate Low and Ultra ) , all players should use Ultra to maximise fidelity , ideally in combination with some resolution scaling , which can increase sharpness and clarity without having to use the two Sharpening settings . <p> Bloom intensifies and improves the appearance of bright lights , and the look of a scene when bright Bloom lighting interacts with other visual effects . Furthermore , it enables the use of the Lens Flare Quality setting . <p> Three detail levels are available , along with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloom effects throughout the game : <p> Elsewhere , Bloom is n't as noticeable , often being confined to glow around a light , or a flare of light on armor . Interestingly , the less-accurate Medium is more aesthetically-pleasing than High due to its more-visible approximated look . <p> Performance : Being a post-process effect Bloom costs less than a single frame per second , with that cost raising to a whopping 1.6 frames per second on Ultra . <p> Capsule Shadow Quality <p> Before the release of Unreal Engine 4.11 , characters in scenes lit by indirect lighting would appear to float across the terrain due to the lack of grounding shadows ( Ambient Occlusion helped , but not enough ) . With the new Capsule Shadow Quality effect , very soft indirect shadows are now cast by capsule representations of characters , grounding them to the terrain , as demonstrated in this image : <p> In Gears of War 4 the effect is less pronounced due to the camera position and the speed of the action , but when you do see the setting at work it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultra adds Capsule Shadows to virtually all characters and NPCs in a scene ; High limits the number of enhanced characters to your crew and the nearest few enemies ; and Medium greatly reduces the detail of the shadow , lowering image quality . <p> Performance : Costing 1.3 frames per second at most , Capsule Shadows are an inexpensive way to improve fidelity and realism in indirectly-lit scenes . <p> Character Level of Detail <p> Character Level of Detail alters the quality of non-player character models , and those of enemies , too . In simple terms : <p> Ultra enables all characters to be rendered at max detail at all distances <p> High enables all characters to be rendered at max detail , though the quality will decrease as the distance from a character increases <p> Medium sees two nearby characters rendered at max detail , another two characters at the next-highest detail level , and everyone else the lowest detail level <p> Low has one nearby character rendered at max detail , another at the next-highest detail level , and everyone else at the lowest detail level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over range than on Medium and High <p> In practice , the adjustments Character Level of Detail makes are impossible to see , even in levels filled with massive waves of enemies . Enlargements with Photoshop do show pixel-level changes , and if you 've got the keenest of eyes you may note the changing LOD during gameplay , but it 's safe to say most wo n't . <p> Performance : This super subtle setting has a 0.8 FPS spread between it 's minimum and maximum settings , so you may as well leave Character Level of Detail on Ultra for the highest-quality experience . <p> Character Texture Detail <p> On the surface Character Texture Detail seems self-explanatory , but dig a bit deeper and you 'll discover that it adjusts the texture resolution of weapons and vehicles , as well as those of characters . <p> In the interactive comparisons below we see the limited impact of the setting in real-time cinematics , where only a few select textures are affected . <p> Performance : Like other texture settings in Gears of War 4 , and other games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only being gated by the amount of available VRAM on your graphics card . And as max settings at 4K consume less than 6GB of VRAM , most modern GPUs will have no issue setting this and other in-game texture settings to Ultra at 1920x1080 , the most popular gaming resolution . We must point out , however , that " 6GB+ " is officially recommended for Ultra , so your mileage may vary . <p> Note : with a mechanical hard drive and 4-Core CPU , the unpacking and loading of textures and associated mipmaps will take longer and use more CPU cycles , in turn taking CPU cycles from other tasks . Potentially this could decrease your framerate , increase loading times , and temporarily limit maximum GPU utilisation if your system becomes CPU-bound while streaming in textures during gameplay . This occurs with all four texture settings , but is most easily seen when raising the World Texture Detail setting due to the volume of textures it controls . For the best experience play Gears of War 4 on a SSD , and use a CPU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Gears of War 4 's Depth of Field ( DoF ) setting adds out of focus blurring exclusively to cutscenes rendered in real-time ( other cinematics are pre-rendered video files ) . On the " Insane " setting , designed for the most powerful PCs , DoF is upgraded to Circle Depth of Field , first seen in the stunning " A Boy &amp; His Kite " demo . <p> Compared to the Gaussian Depth of Field used on Medium , High and Ultra , Circle Depth of Field more closely resembles the out of focus effects seen on the latest cameras , further improving blur quality . However , its impact is only seen on occasion due to its subtlety and the non-stop movement of the camera in cutscenes . For an example , look to the interactive comparisons below - Circle DoF smooths and further blurs specular detail , and counters the dithering and aliasing that can be seen around the holes through which we see characters . <p> Performance : Designed for the very best GPUs , Insane Depth of Field is a 17.6 FPS premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rendering everything else in the game in a cinematic , so if you were running at 30 FPS during gameplay , you could be running at around 12 FPS in a cutscene with this " Insane " Circle Depth of Field . The often-identical Ultra , meanwhile , is 5.7 FPS slower than Low , and the good-enough High is just 2 FPS slower . <p> Most folks should probably use High , as Medium only applies Depth of Field blurring in select scenes , as demonstrated above in our interactive comparisons . Ultra offers only marginal improvements over High most of the time , and " Insane " simply is n't worth the cost unless you 've got a supercomputer from the future that can power through the pain without flinching . <p> Dynamic Resolution Scaling <p> For some years console games have employed techniques that dynamically lower a game 's rendering resolution when the action heats up , helping maintain the desired 30 or 60 FPS target . Now , we 're seeing the same technology on PC , in Forza Motorsport 6 : APEX , Forza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly it can help you maximize image quality , and retain a smooth level of performance in even the most intensive moments of a game . <p> In the screenshots above we 've done the following : <p> Set a framerate cap , which enables the use of Dynamic Resolution Scaling <p> Increased the rendering resolution by 33% to 2560x1440 using the Scaled Resolution setting , which works just like NVIDIA DSR and Downsampling options in other games <p> Enabled Dynamic Resolution Scaling in the Advanced Video settings <p> Set the maximum amount of Dynamic Resolution Scaling to 33% in the Advanced Video settings <p> During gameplay this combination of settings will deliver a Downsampled 2560x1440 experience on a 1920x1080 display , greatly improving image quality game-wide , and if performance should dip below 90 FPS the Downsampling will be reduced by up to 33% until game load is reduced and performance is once again available for Downsampling . This prevents the rendering resolution from going below the screen resolution , avoiding upscaling , and makes full use of all available performance at all times . <p> And of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very scalable game , you can use Dynamic Resolution to decrease the internal rendering resolution below your screen resolution , without sacrificing HUD and menu clarity . <p> Effects Texture Detail <p> When you think about visual effects in games you think about explosions , fire , and smoke , which are often rendered with individual particles and other technologies . But given the right conditions and some technical know-how , fire and other effects can be created with layered textures , most commonly in the periphery or background of a scene where players are unable to examine the effect in detail . <p> On occasion though you can get up-close , revealing how the effects are altered by the setting : <p> In a wider view , the resolution of the smaller fire effect is less visible , and only with Photoshop enlargement or interactive comparisons can you see the improvements to blending and resolution on the larger fire effects and the smoke : <p> Performance : Like other texture settings , Effects Texture Detail has a negligible impact on performance , only being gated by the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With Environment Reflections enabled objects and surfaces that have reflective properties reflect the world around them , which in some instances can greatly change the look of a scene . Primarily you 'll note the impact of this setting on wet floors , and on the characters ' armor , which will remain unrealistically shiny and bright in dark scenes . <p> Performance : Costing only 1.3 frames per second , Environment Reflections is a worthy addition for most configs given its impact on image quality . <p> Foliage Draw Distance <p> Predominantly , Foliage Draw Distance affects the rendering distance of grass and small flowers , though a few bushes and larger plants are also affected . As you 'll see below , Ultra displays grass as far as the eye can see , and also increases the fidelity of foliage by the bridge ; Medium cuts the draw distance right back ; and Low prunes just about everything ( remaining foliage may be affected to a degree by the World Level of Detail setting ) . <p> You may have also noticed that Foliage Draw Distance affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocks and pebbles controlled by the World Level of Detail setting . In some scenes this has a significant impact on image quality : <p> Performance : Assuming the presence of grass , rocks , and other affected game elements , Foliage Draw Distance can cost up to 2.9 FPS . <p> In our opinion , High is as low as you should go given the reduction in foliage and rock density , and increase in draw and pop-in that occurs on Medium . <p> Lens Flare Quality <p> Lens Flare adds halos and highlights when the camera is pointed in the direction of a bright light . As the comparisons below demonstrate , higher detail levels increase the resolution of the effect , adding visible separation between flares . <p> Performance:Gears of War 4 's occasionally-seen lens flares cost at most 2.1 frames per second . Note however that Bloom Quality must also be enabled to use Lens Flares , making the combined cost that bit higher in many scenes . <p> If you 're in desperate need of extra performance , and do n't want to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are by no means crucial to achieving a high level of overall image quality . <p> Light Scattering Quality <p> A rarely-seen effect in Gears of War 4 , Light Scattering enables volumetric light to be cast through dynamic objects , adjusts the quality of blending with transparencies and other game elements , and adjusts the quality of the shadows and shapes that affect its appearance . <p> Performance : Enabling Medium Light Scattering Quality costs 1.4 frames per second , which for most players should be a sufficient level of detail given the infrequency of the effect 's use . In comparison , High costs 2.3 FPS , and Ultra 3.3 FPS . <p> Light Shaft Quality <p> Throughout Gears of War 4 you 'll see many light shafts ( A.K.A. God Rays and Crepuscular Rays ) , but only those generated by sunlight in a few Acts of the game are affected by the Light Shaft Quality setting . <p> As you can likely tell from the screenshots and comparisons above , higher detail levels increase the number of light shafts , the quality and precision of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . <p> Performance : Light Shafts will cost you 1.1 frames per second to activate , and 2.5 FPS to max out . <p> Our recommendation : use High or Ultra as Medium loses a large amount of detail . <p> Lighting Texture Detail <p> Lighting Texture Detail affects the quality of Lightmaps and Shadowmaps in Gears of War 4 . Lightmaps enable the brightness of surfaces and fixed objects in a statically-lit scene to be pre-calculated and saved to a texture , allowing a game to run faster , and Shadowmaps operate much the same for shadows . At close range , however , real-time shadows that are more aesthetically-pleasing may be shown instead to maximize image quality and realism . <p> As one would expect , the quality of these light and shadow maps increases with the detail level , creating richer , more-realistic scenes with more aesthetically-pleasing lighting and shadowing . Take a look below : <p> Performance : Like the other texture settings , Lighting Texture Detail has a negligible impact on performance . <p> Particle Spawn Rate <p> Shooting surfaces , killing enemies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spawn Rate the visual quality of particle-based effects can be adjusted . In practice , turning down the setting results in less smoke being emitted by your assault rifle , smaller puffs of smoke and dirt when shooting an object , fewer pieces of debris being emitted when shooting the ground , and less blood and gore when killing enemies . Smoke and dozens of other effects found throughout the game also utilize particles , so decreasing the Particle Spawn Rate can have a noticeable impact on effect fidelity . <p> As ever , capturing the full impact of a dynamic particle effect is next to impossible in screenshots , though we can somewhat demonstrate with this Min vs . Max comparison where the density of smoke is much lower , as is the intensity of the smaller fires beneath the helicopter . <p> Performance : It 's tricky to ascertain the maximum performance cost of this setting as we ca n't evaluate every use of particles throughout the game , but in the testing we did conduct the delta between minimum and maximum was 2.4 FPS . <p> Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting enables Eye Adaptation and Tone Mapping , and adjusts the quality of Translucency , which can be applied to special effects , translucent materials , and more . As for Eye Adaptation , that functions like the " HDR " settings in older games , simulating how eyes gradually adjust when moving from bright to dark areas , and vice versa . And Tone Mapping maps the wide range of High Dynamic Range colors into the small Low Dynamic Range of monitors , so they can display said colors , and so the look of scenes can be dynamically adjusted for stylistic effect . <p> Adjusting the effect in locations throughout the game made a microscopic difference to image quality , though undoubtedly there are locations that benefit ( our pre-release , perf-final build lacks some levels , and does n't include multiplayer maps that make use of varied lighting conditions ) . Given the similarly microscopic 0.4 FPS performance cost of Ultra , you may as well set this to max for those occasions when it is noticeable . <p> Refractions <p> With Refractions enabled , light traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , altering the appearance of the scene . The effect can be clearly observed in the occasional cinematic , when standing under or near splashing or falling water , when looking at open bodies of water , and when looking at the engines of flying enemies . <p> Performance : Bending and distorting your image will set you back 0.6 FPS . <p> Scaled Resolution <p> Like NVIDIA DSR , Scaled Resolution renders the action at a higher , more detailed resolution , and automatically shrinks the result back down to the screen resolution of your monitor . Everything seen is of a significantly higher fidelity , and looks sharper and clearer , too . And if you 've got the performance you can crank the resolution up to 7680x4320 , 400% higher than 1920x1080 , the most popular gaming resolution . <p> As detailed earlier , Scaled Resolution can be combined with Dynamic Resolution Scaling to increase image quality across the game , without sacrificing performance in the game 's most demanding moments , making it a must-have for anyone with spare performance . <p> Screen Space Reflections <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflections and reflective shine , though in many cases these are pre-calculated via the Lighting Texture Detail setting , or come courtesy of the Environment Reflections setting . <p> For real-time , dynamic Screen Space Reflections ( SSR ) , capable of reflecting characters , effects , and other game elements within the visible ' screen space ' of the player , look in particular at puddles , larger bodies of water , and visibly-glossy surfaces . For instance , the interactive comparisons below show a wet floor dynamically reflecting the bullet impact , the impact smoke , the bullet smoke , objects , a character , and the glowing pods in the corner . <p> As the detail level is raised the clarity and accuracy of reflections is steadily increased , and dithering that is particularly noticeable at lower resolutions is removed . Finally , as we switch to " Insane " , reflections are upgraded to a next-generation , super high-quality glossy technique that enables them to appear less artificial by applying a realistic blur as the distance from the source increases . These " Insane " reflections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of surfaces in a scene . For examples , take a look below . <p> Performance : With 6 FPS covering Low to Ultra , we 're recommending High if Ultra is that bit too expensive : High costs only 0.5 FPS more than Medium , is much clearer , has almost no dithering , and is 1.3 FPS faster than Ultra ( 4 FPS faster at 4K ) . " Insane " , meanwhile , lives up to its next-gen billing , running 38 frames per second slower than Ultra , and even slower at higher resolutions . It looks great , but is only recommended for the very best GPUs . <p> Screen Space Shadow Quality <p> Gears of War 4 's marks the debut of Screen Space Shadow Quality , a brand new Unreal Engine 4.13 technology that can add a considerable amount of shadow detail to foliage , ground debris , cliffs , and other detailed game elements in view of the player . <p> If The Coalition were to solely use cascaded shadow maps , their quality would need to be significantly higher to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quality setting , and that would of course make the shadow maps far more expensive to render . By using this new technique increased levels of shadow detail can be added throughout the scene , complementing the work of the game 's other shadow settings , with a minimal performance cost . <p> Performance : Between detail levels we noted only minute changes , and only at lower resolutions . At higher resolution , save a frame or two per second by selecting Medium or High . <p> Shadow Quality <p> Gears of War 4 's Shadow Quality setting primarily affects shadows cast on dynamic game elements , either from scene lights or your weapon 's flashlight , though other uses can also be found here and there . <p> For the most part , the scenario presented below is typical for Shadow Quality : Low disables almost all of the setting 's shadows ; Medium adds the bulk of the shadows back ; High increases shadow map resolution and quality , which improves existing shadows and adds new ones ; and Ultra improves things further still . <p> Performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plentiful number of characters , Shadow Quality can cost up to 6.7 FPS extra on Ultra , though High and Medium are n't far behind , whilst delivering shadows of noticeably lower quality . As such , we recommend players aim to enable Ultra , even if other settings have to be dialed back . After all , shadows are in every scene of the entire game , and the ones cast on your character are front and center at all times . <p> Sharpening <p> Temporal Anti-Aliasing unavoidably softens the screen when doing its thing . Often , enthusiasts turn to tools like ReShade to counteract this softness through the injection of screen sharpening . This however introduces additional aliasing and temporal aliasing , and in some cases can get players into hot water with anti-cheat tools in multiplayer games . <p> To save players the trouble of jumping through hoops Gears of War 4 includes in-game Sharpening , as well as Temporal Anti-Aliasing Sharpening . The latter deals exclusively with edges , while this Sharpening setting tackles textures , though you can avoid using both with a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately render skin in games , additional techniques and technologies are required . In real and virtual worlds light bounces from most objects and surfaces , which we can accurately and easily render with any number of technologies . In comparison , light striking skin is absorbed and diffused , with some rays being re-emitted , albeit at a lower intensity . Without a suitable technology simulating this effect character skin is uniformly lit , detracting from the quality of the picture . <p> In Gears of War 4 , Subsurface Scattering ( SSS or SSSSS ) is employed to achieve the desired result , though only in real-time cinematic cutscenes . In ideal circumstances , such as the one shown directly below , SSS can be clearly seen . <p> Performance : Medium and High cost 0.3 and 0.6 FPS more than Low , respectively , while Ultra will set you back 2.6 FPS . Given the marginal improvements Ultra offers in the majority of the game , those seeking extra performance are recommended to dial SSS back to the aforementioned lower-quality settings . <p> Texture Filtering <p> Texture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect the sharpness of textures , especially those seen in the distance , on oblique angles , or on the sides of the screen . Without Texture Filtering surfaces may appear blurry , and image quality is degraded . <p> In Gears of War 4 players can choose between four Anisotropic detail levels , but as you 'll note below there 's a less dramatic impact on image quality than is ordinarily seen . Even so , you should only pick 16x given the power of modern graphics cards and the low cost of Texture Filtering on PC . <p> Performance : Unsurprisingly , Texture Filtering has a negligible performance cost on PC , with the delta being just 1 frame per second between 2x and 16x . As such , there 's no reason not to use 16x , even on potato PCs . <p> World Level of Detail <p> As the name suggests , this setting adjusts the amount of detail in the world . In practice that translates to the addition of extra branches and leaves on trees , thicker foliage in spots that are n't affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , more detailed bricks , ruins and roofs , more detailed rocks , and additional details on objects here and there . <p> Performance : World Texture Detail costs slightly more than other texture settings due to its impact on bump mapping , but we would n't recommend saving performance by dropping to High given the importance of the setting to overall image quality . <p> Gears of War 4 is an extremely scalable game , and runs at quite the clip on Ultra settings on many GPUs , even at 2560x1440 . At 4K , only the NVIDIA TITAN X approaches 60 FPS , achieving a tantalizingly-close 56 FPS in the in-game benchmark . With a quick overclock however , it was up to 65 FPS , delivering a super smooth , Ultra-quality experience . <p> Click to enlarge .

@@20827159 @827159/ <h> Call of Duty : Black Ops 3 Graphics &amp; Performance Guide <p> It 's November once more , meaning it 's time for another Thanksgiving , more apocalyptic Black Friday shopping scenes , and the latest release in the venerable Call of Duty franchise . This year , Black Ops 3 is the game on deck , bringing 4-player campaign co-op , 4-player co-op survival , 4-player co-op Zombies , the ever-popular multiplayer mode , and a whole bunch of other stuff . <p> Under the hood there 's an upgraded engine , a new renderer , an improved animation systems , new lighting effects , numerous other tweaks , and a whole lot more . For PC gamers , all game modes are now accessible via a single . exe , removing the need to launch separate versions of the game in Steam and swap between . exes every time you change mode . Also worth noting : graphics setting changes no longer force a level reload , or require the . exe to be restarted , making setting configuration a painless process . <p> In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demonstrate their impact on image quality , reveal their relative performance cost at 1920x1080 , the most popular PC gaming resolution , and also look at a couple of enhancements that are possible using NVIDIA software tweaks . So strap in for our latest Graphics and Performance guide . <p> Black Ops 3 developer Treyarch does n't offer a recommended system configuration for players , but does say that you 'll need a Intel Core i3-530 , 6GB of RAM , and a GeForce GTX 470 with 1GB of VRAM , at minimum . <p> Stepping up to the plate , we benchmarked our range of GPUs , searching for cards capable of solid , smooth 60 FPS at a High level of detail in the ever-popular multiplayer mode , which will be the go-to mode for most over the lifetime of Black Ops 3 . <p> For this guide , we benchmarked the more-demanding single-player mode to demonstrate the maximum performance impact of each setting . At the conclusion , we 'll look at overall max-setting performance for those seeking a system capable of the definitive level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 Graphics Settings <p> Black Ops 3 's twelve graphics settings are for the most part self-explanatory , having a singular purpose that 's detailed by the name . Nevertheless , we 've thoroughly examined each and demonstrated their image quality and relative performance below . <p> Ambient Occlusion <p> Ambient Occlusion ( AO ) adds contact shadows where two surfaces or objects meet , and where objects block light from reaching another nearby game element . The AO technique used and the quality of the implementation affects the accuracy of AO shadows , and whether new shadows are formed when the level of occlusion is low . Without Ambient Occlusion , scenes appear flat and unrealistic , and objects float on surfaces . <p> In Call of Duty : Black Ops 3 a custom in-house solution is employed , with four levels of detail . As our following interactive comparisons demonstrate , the Black Ops Ambient Occlusion technique ( BOAO ) can improve image quality by a good degree . <p> With time of observe the world , the benefits of BOAO are clearly evident , but during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you notice the extra shadows under the seating ? <p> It should be noted that Multi-GPU systems can only be toggled between BOAO On or Off . Evaluating performance , image quality and the config file , it would appear that " On " is the single GPU 's " Extra " mode . <p> Performance : There 's a 9 frame per second delta between Extra and Low . In the vast majority of scenes you 'll be hard-pressed to notice the difference , and even in the best AO test locations the loss of image quality on Low is ... low . <p> As in Advanced Warfare and other games sporting the latest implementations of SMAA , SMAA T2x includes a temporal anti-aliasing component , helping reduce the shimmering of anti-aliased edges when they or the camera moves . Like other implementations of the technology the improvement is excellent , and is recommended for anyone who can afford the mode 's slightly higher FPS cost . <p> Even in static shots , SMAA T2x has a significant advantage over SMAA 1x , decreasing the severity of aliasing quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps rectify aliasing issues around the blackboards . The Filmic variant of SMAA T2x , meanwhile , decreases the severity of the noticeable background aliasing , but increases the degree of aliasing on shadows and other game elements in the scene . <p> In this second set of images and comparisons you can better evaluate the difference between SMAA T2x , and Filmic SMAA T2x . Note the changes on textures , the loss of clarity on the word " Fire Alarm " , the changes in lighting , and the changes to the vibrancy of shiny metal . <p> Ultimately , your choice of Anti-Aliasing technique will be personal preference , but overall we 'd give the nod to SMAA T2x . Do note , Multi-GPU systems see a reduction in the number of available options . In this case , SMAA T2x and the Filmic versions of both SMAA options are removed , decreasing image quality by a noticeable degree at 1920x1080 . At higher resolutions aliasing is less of an issue , and temporal aliasing is n't as noticeable , but it 's still a blow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Performance : Despite being post-process options , we see a comparatively high performance cost for Anti-Aliasing in Black Ops 3 , with SMAA T2x costing up to 10 frames per second . <p> Dynamic Shadows <p> A simple on-off option , Dynamic Shadows toggles the rendering of shadows from objects and game elements that can move , be that a ceiling fan 's blades , a NPC , or a mug on a desk ( the fidelity of these shadows is dictated by the Shadow Map Quality setting , which is detailed further down the page ) . <p> Performance : Given the massive loss of image quality from removing dozens of shadows in every scene , you 'll want to enable this setting even on a Potato PC . <p> Combined with Extra Quality Shadow Maps , Dynamic Shadows can cost up to 13 frames per second . On lower Shadow Map detail levels the cost is a negligible 3 frames per second , though this will vary with the complexity and action with a scene . <p> Mesh Quality <p> The detail level and fidelity of trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements is controlled by the Mesh Quality setting , as is the visibility of some distant detail . As you 'd expect , the level of detail gradually decreases as the setting is turned down , but never do the affected game elements appear an eyesore . <p> Performance : Mesh Quality 's cost varies from map to map and level to level , but in general it has a minor impact on performance . <p> Order Independent Transparency <p> Call of Duty games have all kinds of action on-screen , and with so much stuff potentially overlapping you need to layer things correctly to prevent glitches and corruption , and general mis-layering , like having a higher layer in Photoshop accidentally occlude something important . This is computationally inexpensive with solid geometry , but with transparencies it 's the opposite . <p> Enter Order Independent Transparency ( OIT ) , which correctly layers transparencies at a comparatively low cost , ensuring transparent smoke correctly renders in front of a window , which renders correctly in front of foliage , for example . Previous methods were view dependent , requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved , were constructed from multiple rendering passes , and often produced less-than-perfect results . <p> As you 'll see later , OIT is by no means free , but its performance impact is just a fraction of that required for other less-efficient techniques . And as an added bonus , it also enables players to activate the high-impact Volumetric Lighting setting . <p> Our first set of comparisons exemplify the function and impact of OIT - with the setting disabled , the glass , the detail on the glass , the waterfall , and the insides of the rooms on the left and right are rendered incorrectly . In other words , game elements are mis-layered or invisible , and image quality is degraded . <p> In the course of our testing we found the expected mis-layered and occluded transparencies , as demonstrated above , and also discovered that OIT enabled light to be rendered correctly through transparent surfaces , adding glow and bloom , and brightening the displays of monitors and other tech . <p> In dozens of tests we observed no differences whatsoever between High and Medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in large , graphically-intensive combat scenes featuring multiple layers of smoke , foliage , and transparencies . Saying that , having played the entire campaign , plus multiplayer , we 've yet to note any OIT-related corruption on Medium . <p> Further examination of the game 's file reveals that Medium reduces the maximum number of overlapping transparency layers by half . As stated however , we 've yet to note any degradation of image quality even in highly complex scenes . <p> Performance : At around 8 frames per second OIT is n't free , but it does enable transparencies and light to render correctly . Undoubtedly then , those wanting a high level of fidelity should enable it . And given the complete lack of visible difference between Medium and High , one can safely skip the costlier detail level . <p> Render Resolution <p> In Black Ops 3 you select your Screen Resolution for the rendering of menus and the user interface , for instance 1920x1080 on a 1920x1080 monitor , and then select your Render Resolution , which adjusts the resolution of your graphics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1600x900 on their 1920x1080 monitor , whilst retaining crisp and clear menus and UI elements , and gamers with performance to spare to increase their Render Resolution all the way to 3840x2160 ( 4K ) for significantly improved image quality . This is commonly referred to as Downscaling and Downsampling , for the reduction and increase , respectively , of rendering fidelity . <p> When Downsampling , every aspect of a game 's graphics is rendered at a higher quality and then shrunk down to your Screen Resolution , creating a more detailed picture with less aliasing . But as most games lack a built-in Downsampling feature we released our free NVIDIA Dynamic Super Resolution ( DSR ) technology alongside the GeForce GTX 970 and 980 , enabling gamers to Downsample in the vast majority of titles . <p> Because Black Ops 3 does feature a built-in Downsampling option , we can combine the two to increase the effective rendering resolution to an incredible 7680x4320 on a 1920x1080 monitor , creating a playable ' bullshot ' . At this level of detail , minute details on surfaces can be easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance , and every other element of the game sees an increase in fidelity . <p> Few will have the necessary hardware to power a 7680x4320 experience , but many do have sufficient gear for 3840x2160 on their 1920x1080 monitors . NVIDIA DSR and the in-game Render Resolution setting are both capable of rendering at this level , so we put them through their paces to discover if either had a performance or image quality advantage of note . <p> The answer : image quality is a tie , though Render Resolution does gain a minor victory by running a few frames per second faster . In stills , the 4K NVIDIA DSR screenshots of course look better , but in-game they 're being dynamically downsampled to 1920x1080 where there 's no discernible difference . <p> For those intending to use these options , here 's a look first at Render Resolution . Note the reduced aliasing , the increasing number of flowers , the ever-thicker foliage , the new ground detail rendered on the right of the screen , and the higher-quality background . <p> In-game the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination are virtually identical , with Rendering Resolution doing a superior job on some game elements , and NVIDIA Dynamic Super Resolution on others . <p> Performance : To wrap things up , here 's a look at the performance of the two modes . <p> And for fun here 's how a pair of GeForce GTX 980 T is perform when the resolution is set to 3840x2160 and we start cranking up the Render Resolution setting , all the way to an effective 7680x4320 . <p> Shadow Map Quality <p> Also known as " Shadow Quality " , you 'll be amazed to learn that Shadow Map Quality adjusts the quality of shadows . At their highest detail levels , just about everything is clear and well defined as you 'd hope and expect . <p> In many scenes , and every multiplayer location we tested , " Extra " has no impact on image quality . Investigating further , we discovered it only affects the smallest and most detailed of shadows , such as these : <p> The game 's configuration file in C : Program Files ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extra enables multi-sampled shadow filtering , and steps up the quality of shadows once more . Interestingly , there 's room to increase shadow quality even further by doubling SpotShadowTextureSize= to 8192 , and quadrupling OmniShadowTextureSize= to 2048 . You can also adjust the maximum number of character shadows that are rendered by editing ActorShadows= . <p> Performance : In single-player , where the Extra shadows are most readily found , the performance and memory requirements can increase considerably . <p> If you 're searching for extra performance , drop Shadow Quality to High , but we would n't recommend going any lower - on Medium there 's an appreciable reduction in shadow quality in all scenes , and Low sees the complete loss of all shadow definition . <p> Subsurface Scattering <p> To accurately render skin in games , additional techniques and technologies are required . In real and virtual worlds light bounces from most objects and surfaces , which we can accurately and easily render with any number of technologies . In comparison , light striking skin is absorbed and diffused , with some rays being emitted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simulating this effect character skin is uniformly lit , detracting from the quality of the picture . <p> In Black Ops 3 , Subsurface Scattering ( SSS ) is employed to achieve the desired result , as the following interactive comparison kind of demonstrates . <p> Need a closer look ? <p> Performance : Subsurface Scattering is a subtle effect that for most folks wo n't justify its 5 frames per second cost . <p> Texture Filtering <p> As you 're likely aware , Texture Filtering , Anisotropic Filtering , and other similarly named options affect the sharpness of textures , especially those in the distance or on the sides of the screen . Without Texture Filtering surfaces appear blurry , and image quality is significantly degraded . <p> In Black Ops 3 , three options are available , though each falls below the fidelity possible with NVIDIA Control Panel Anisotropic Filtering , as we 'll show momentarily . <p> To improve upon the level of in-game Texture Filtering we can forcibly enable Higher Quality Anisotropic Filtering via the NVIDIA Control Panel , like so : <p> In-game , fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making everything that bit sharper . Having to restart the game for the change to be implemented , our comparison areas are limited . Below , the best 1:1 comparison we could capture is shown - focus on the gap between the three rugs , and the floor tiles in the foreground to observe the improvement . <p> Performance : Typically , Anisotropic has a negligible impact on performance , and that 's the case here , too . <p> Call of Duty : Black Ops 3 utilises a similar texture caching system as Advanced Warfare , enabling the game to store yet-to-be-required textures in Video RAM ( VRAM ) , reducing load times and the chance of seeing texture fade-in when accessing new areas of a level . <p> Actual usage is impossible to ascertain , but in testing we noted no difference in image quality , texture draw times or frame pacing at 1920x1080 when switching a 12GB card , which was ' using ' 8GB , for a 4GB card , on an 17-5960X , 16GB system . <p> As our interactive comparisons demonstrate , Extra adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game world , and sharpens up incidental details , like text on an object , or a specular shine on a floor . On Medium , numerous surfaces lose specular detail , glossiness and other properties , and almost all lose a significant amount of texture fidelity . And as you 'd expect , Low looks last-gen , serving only as a compatibility mode for those with only 1GB of VRAM . <p> Here , Extra merely sharpens a few small textures , and adds sharpness to the display 's graphics . On Medium , pre-baked reflections lose much of their detail and vibrancy , and other textures and surfaces lose additional detail . <p> And finally , we see the biggest influence of Extra : the improvement of incidental map and level detail . This digital billboard is out of the line of fire and is n't anything you 'd ever focus on during multiplayer , yet it receives a significant upgrade on Extra . <p> For most folks , High will be sufficient during gameplay . The occasionally blurry texture , like the text on the glass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference during gameplay . <p> Performance : A delta of 8 frames per second between the minimum and maximum value is unusually large for a texture setting . The game 's files reveal that in addition to affecting the quality of general textures , the setting also adjusts the quality of sun shadow textures , the quality of effect textures , the quality of decal textures , and the quality of the aforementioned reflection textures . And finally , it controls whether textures remain in memory after being rendered , or are streamed in every time they 're required . <p> If you 've got the VRAM ( and RAM ? ) , and are receiving a smooth , stutter-free experience , use Extra for the definitive level of image quality . <p> Volumetric Lighting <p> Black Ops 3 's final setting enables the rendering of light shafts , typically known as God Rays ( also : crepuscular rays , volumetric lighting , sun beams , sun shafts , light shafts ) . In some levels you 'll find God Rays projected in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close they 're the real deal , though you do also need Order Independent Transparency enabled to see them . <p> In most locations there 'll be no observable difference between High and Medium because geometry is wide-open . Above , and more visibly below , geometry and effects complicate the rendering of the light shafts , highlighting the gulf in accuracy between the two detail levels . <p> If you wish to further increase their fidelity load config.ini in C : Program Files ( x86 ) SteamsteamappscommonCall of Duty Black Ops IIIplayers and crank **32;0;TOOLONG and **34;34;TOOLONG up to a maximum of 256 . The in-game maximums are substantially lower , so expect a large impact to your performance . <p> Performance : The performance cost of God Rays and the other Volumetric Lighting effects can be significant , though as High only occasionally makes any noticeable difference you could safely step down to Medium if you 're struggling for performance . <p> Given the pervasive use of Volumetric Lighting effects in the campaign , we 'd most certainly recommend enabling them . In other modes you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framerates . <p> Settings Wrap-Up <p> In every version of the game we 've tested , the single-player and co-op campaign has been considerably more demanding than multiplayer , where use of the most demanding effects is often limited to enable more players to achieve framerates of 60 or more for that Call of Duty ' feel ' . At times , the difference in performance is as large as 50% . <p> But as you ca n't accurately test multiplayer across multiple runs on numerous graphics cards , all data must come from single-player . With the above in mind , here are our max setting single-player benchmarks , from a repeatable slice of tightly scripted gameplay , for those attempting to attain maximum image quality : <p> Performance in levels with more randomness , which ca n't be accurately benchmarked , drops slightly further in our experience , but in general the above is indicative of demanding moments of the campaign . <p> Overclocking <p> If you need extra performance , overclocking your CPU and GPU will pay dividends in Call of Duty : Black Ops 3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how with the help of GeForce Garage . <p> G-SYNC : Eliminating Stutters &amp; Tearing For The Ultimate Experience <p> NVIDIA revolutionised computer displays in 2013 with the introduction of variable refresh rates , enabling gamers to enjoy highly responsive , tear-free , stutter-free experiences on G-SYNC monitors .

Did you know you could be sinking your foes with a bit more style , or historical accuracy if that 's your thing , thanks to a sea of user-created ship skins ? <p> Well you can , and we 're going to show you how you can have your favorite ship outfitted with a spanking new paint job in relatively short order . As the premium USS cruiser Atlanta is a staff favourite we 're going to use that ship as our primary example to mod here , but you can follow the same steps for any ship you wish to modify that you can find a skin for . <p> ( Note : other players will not see your skin in-game unless they have the same skin mod installed . ) <h> Find a Custom Skin for Your Favourite Ship <p> Well make theAtlanta look like it did during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " JimKongil " and available on the WoWS forum . You can do the same with your own Atlanta or pick a skin you like for any other ship and modify the following steps accordingly . <p> First , download the skin and then unpack it using a utility such as 7-Zip or WinRAR . Place the extracted folder ( includes three subfolders : ship , director , guns ) somewhere on your PC that makes sense like C : DownloadsWoWS ModsSkinsAtlanta ( or whichever ship you 've chosen ) . This will make it easy to change skins for the same ship in the future , and you 'll likely want to start a collection trust us . <p> Here 's how the Atlanta looks in port with just its dull ol ' base grey paint scheme . <h> Create a Directory for Custom Skin Mods <p> The best way to install the skin is to create a folder directory inside the resmods folder in your WoWS directory that matches where the game 's default textures are installed . This , essentially , creates an overwrite folder that tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base game 's textures . Many skins you download will include a resmodscontent folder designed for you to drag and drop into your own resmods folder for quick-and-simple installation . <p> Our example above does this , so you can just copy the " content " folder from the extracted archive and paste it into your X : WoWSresmods0.5.5.0 folder . ( If this 0.5.5.0 folder does not exist create it . " 0.5.5.0 " is the current version of WoWS , and the name of this folder should always match the game 's current version number . ) <p> If you chose a different skin that does not come packed in the resmod folder directory structure do n't  worry , its simple to do this yourself , manually . Modify your resmods folder by adding the following subfolders : <p> LONG ... <p> LONG ... <p> LONG ... <p> Again , this folder structure mirrors that you will find inside the res folder in your WoWS directory : The res folder is where all the game 's base assets are installed . Now , we just manually place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the folders we created above in resmods . This tells the game to use our mod files instead of the game 's default files . <p> And we 're done let 's launch the game and take a look in our port . <p> Here 's our " new " Atlanta , clad as she was in late 1942 . <h> How About a Custom Battleship , Captain ? <p> Let 's try one more this time a late-war scheme for the USS battleship class , North Carolina . Grab the mod and unpack as we did above to your downloaded mods folder , where you 'll find a director , gun and ship folder . <p> Important : this mod 's secondary gun and director skins share the same names as those we used above for the Atlanta , so it will replace them . For this reason , it 's best to only install one skin at a time per nation in the game to avoid conflicts like this . So delete the files you created for the Atlanta above before proceeding . <p> Copy and paste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director folder into the directortextures folder in resmods . Repeat for the guns folder you will notice that there is now a " main " folder you must also add to your usaguns folder in resmods . Do so and place the files from the mod 's main and secondary gun folders in their corresponding folders in resmods . Finally , create a " battleship " folder with a " textures " subfolder in resmods like so : LONG ... and place the dds file from the mod 's ship folder there . <p> Let 's take a look at our new North Carolina in port . <p> There you have it installing custom skins for your ships in WoWS is a relatively straightforward process . The key is to proceed slowly and take the time to read everything in the mod 's post and any included readme or installation notes files .

@@20827183 @827183/ <h> Call of Duty : Black Ops II Tweak Guide <p> PreviousNext <h> General Optimisation <h> Call of Duty : Black Ops 2 Tweak Guide , By Koroush Ghazi <p> Call of Duty : Black Ops 2 takes elements that fans enjoyed about the first Black Ops , and improves upon them in almost every way . Aside from continuing the Cold War plot established in the first game , Black Ops 2 also provides an interconnecting storyline set in 2025 , expanding the Call of Duty series into futuristic warfare . This time , with branching storylines , the choices you make during the campaign will directly influence the outcome . If you enjoy fast-paced multiplayer , then Black Ops 2 provides a solid enhancement to the online gameplay style of the first game . And for PC gamers everywhere , the good news is that Treyarch has listened to your requests : Black Ops 2 drops support for DirectX 9 in exchange for the more advanced DirectX 10/11 , and features a range of settings to utilize your PC 's capabilities above and beyond those available on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow you to better understand and best utilize all of the configuration options available in Black Ops 2 . <p> What follows are full descriptions for all of the settings available in the various Black Ops 2 options menus . Screenshot comparisons are provided where relevant to highlight the impact on image quality of changing these settings . Performance information is also provided for every setting , although bear in mind that the precise impact on your particular system depends on your specific hardware combination and your other game and system-wide settings . The aim here is to give you enough information so that you can make an informed choice as to the settings you enable or disable to obtain a balance of visual quality and performance acceptable to you . <h> General System Optimisation <p> Almost as important as any in-game setting is the way your Windows installation is configured . A great many problems and performance issues , especially stuttering , crashes and slowdowns , can be traced directly to sub-optimal settings in Windows and out-of-date or badly configured drivers . Go through our Stable Gaming Guide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very least make sure to update your Graphics Drivers to the latest available version . <h> Performance Measurement <p> To successfully conduct any tweaking , you will need some way of objectively measuring your performance in Frames Per Second ( FPS ) . The easiest way to do this is to use the built-in Draw FPS option , found under the Advanced section of the in-game Settings menu . Enabling this option will result in a yellow FPS counter being shown at the top right of the screen . <p> Pay attention to your FPS during the game , particularly during graphically intense scenes , such as combat with multiple enemies , or when special effects such as smoke or explosions are visible . If your FPS dips to a very low level at any point , or is constantly spiking , then this is a good indication that you need to adjust various settings , whether to raise your minimum FPS to at least 30 FPS , or simply to stabilize your framerate to prevent stuttering and variable responsiveness . Keep in mind that since Black Ops 2 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum FPS that is much higher than 30 FPS to maintain sufficient responsiveness to remain competitive . <h> General Settings <p> To access the full suite of in-game settings , launch Call of Duty : Black Ops 2 , and select the Options item on the main menu , then select Settings . The main graphics-related options are covered in detail later in this guide . First we examine the general gameplay , sound and control options in this section . None of these settings has any significant impact on performance . <h> Gameplay <p> Subtitles : If set to Enabled , text subtitles will be shown at the bottom of the screen during conversations and cut scenes , while Disabled removes all such subtitles . This option is specific to campaign mode . <p> Graphic Content : Call of Duty : Black Ops 2 contains content which some players may find disturbing . If this option is set to Disabled , as much of these elements as possible is removed from the game without changing the storyline . This includes blood and gore effects , foul language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This setting has no impact on multiplayer mode . <p> Full Name - The player 's rank icon and rank , any clan tag , and name will be displayed , in that order . <p> Abbreviated - Only the player name , devoid of rank or clan tag , is shown . <p> Icon Only - Only the rank icon and rank level is shown , without any name or clan tag . <p> Color Blind Assist : If set to On , this option changes the colors used in the minimap so that they are more easily distinguishable for people who are color blind . <p> Chat Messages : If set to Show , this option will allow the display of player text chat messages on the screen in multiplayer mode . If you find these messages distracting or annoying , you can remove them by selecting Hide for this setting . <h> Sound <p> Volume : There are multiple sliders here allowing control of the volume level for various game audio elements . This includes : Voice for spoken dialog , Music for in-game background music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Master volume slider that controls the overall volume of all elements , a Cinematic volume slider that determines the level of audio for in-game cut-scenes during campaign mode , and Codcaster sliders to control the volume of gameplay and commentary when watching a pre-recorded game . None of these sliders has any impact on performance , so set them to suit your taste . <p> Hearing Impaired : If this option is enabled , spoken dialog will be enhanced over any background audio to make it easier to distinguish . <p> Sound Device : This item is may not be selectable if you have only one sound output device connected . It displays the name of the sound hardware that Black Ops 2 is currently using to output game audio on your system . If a connected device is not being identified correctly , or you are having problems with audio output on it , then you will first need to check your Windows sound settings under the Sound component of the Windows Control Panel , then check your sound card or motherboard manufacturer 's website for the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio mixes here , each determining the way in which game audio is processed : <p> Headphones - Boosts audio response at both ends of the spectrum to provide richer audio on standard headphones . <p> Treyarch Mix - The recommend audio processing for most systems with standard two or more channel speaker setups , as well as high-end headphones . <p> Bass Boost - Increases the low frequency response to provide heavier bass . Suitable if you prefer more bass , or have small speakers . <p> High Boost - Increases the high frequency response to provide crisper audio . <p> Supercrunch - Provides exaggerated sound output at all frequencies . This can make it easier to detect any noise , particularly during multiplayer . <p> Once a preset is selected , you can click the System Test option to initiate a brief test sequence . However , any changes to the presets during the test sequence will not be reflected until the test is run again . <h> Controls <p> The Controls section of the settings allows you to remap your mouse , gamepad and keyboard control assignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to customize it , but to also become aware of all the various settings . Of note are the following : <p> Invert Mouse Look : If set to Yes , pushing your mouse forward will make your character aim down , and moving your mouse back will make him aim upwards . If set to No , the arrangement is reversed . <p> Mouse Sensitivity : This slider determines the level of responsiveness of the mouse to your movements . The further to the right the slider , the more responsive the mouse will feel . Keep in mind that if your mouse movements feel laggy , even after raising the Mouse Sensitivity , there are several other things you should check : <p> If your framerate falls below around 30 FPS at any time , particularly during heavy combat , you will start to notice reduced responsiveness . You will need to adjust your graphics settings to raise your minimum FPS . <p> Check the Max Frames Per Second graphics setting ( covered later in this guide ) to make sure it is n't set to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too low a maximum frame rate to allow for sufficient responsiveness in a fast-paced game like Black Ops 2 ; it should be set to at least 60 . <p> If the Sync Every Frame setting is enabled , or you have Vertical Sync set to On or Adaptive in the NVIDIA Control Panel , this can contribute to a less responsive feel to mouse movements . See the Sync Every Frame setting in the Graphics Settings section later in this guide for more details . <p> Also keep in mind that a high mouse sensitivity , while it can improve responsiveness , may also reduce accuracy . <p> On the next page we begin our look at the various graphics-related settings in Call of Duty : Black Ops 2 . <h> Graphics Settings <p> Call of Duty : Black Ops 2 has a large number of graphics-related settings , and these can have a substantial impact on the way the game looks and plays on your system . To access all of the available graphics settings , select Options under the Main Menu , then choose the Settings item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these graphics settings in detail , and see exactly how they affect performance and image quality . <p> In the performance graphs shown , for each setting we start with a " baseline " where all options are set to the maximum possible , as well as 4x MSAA , FXAA On , Depth of Field Low , Sync Every Frame Off , and Max Frames Per Second set to Unlimited . From this baseline , we vary individual settings to measure their effect on performance and image quality . From this baseline , we vary individual settings to measure their effect on performance and image quality . To see how various combinations of settings work for other NVIDIA GPUs , check out the Optimal Playable Settings section of the site . <p> Full System Configuration <p> GeForce GTX 660 Ti 2GB <p> Intel Core i7 3960X ( 3.3GHz ) <p> 8GB RAM <p> Win7 64-bit <p> NVIDIA 310.54 WHQL Drivers <h> Resolution &amp; FOV <p> This section begins our look at the graphics settings in Black Ops 2 . Please note that aside from the options provided under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Advanced link at the top of the screen to access a second page with more graphics options . You will have to adjust your graphics settings for each game mode separately . <p> Resolution : This determines the Resolution of the game image , measured by the number of pixels horizontally and vertically ( e.g. 1920 pixels x 1080 pixels ) . The number of resolutions available here is limited by the capabilities of both your graphics card and monitor . The higher the resolution you choose , the more detailed the image will be . However , higher resolutions also generate an increased load on your system , particularly your graphics card , and hence reduce your overall performance . For the sharpest image on an LCD monitor , either select the maximum available resolution here , which is also referred to as your Native Resolution , or if choosing a resolution below your maximum , either use one of the windowed options under the Window Mode option as covered further below , or select the ' No scaling ' option under the ' Adjust desktop size and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx252011 <p> The graph shows that Resolution has a substantial impact on performance . If you want a big improvement in FPS , and all else fails to provide it , then consider lowering your resolution . <p> Display Mode : By default the game runs in Full Screen mode , which takes up the entire screen , and is generally recommended for optimal image quality and memory management . If you want to run the game in a window on your desktop instead , then you can select Windowed , or Windowed ( Fullscreen ) here . If you select Windowed , the size of the game window which appears on your desktop will depend on your Screen Resolution setting . If you select Windowed ( Fullscreen ) , a borderless window which takes up the entire screen will be used . The key difference is that Windowed ( Fullscreen ) mode prevents any of your desktop from showing in the background . Running in Windowed mode is recommended if you want to reduce the game 's resolution to improve performance , but still maintain a crisp image with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can switch between windowed and fullscreen modes at any time by pressing ALT+Enter . <p> Monitor : This setting determines which display is used in a multi-monitor setup . If you have a single monitor , the default of 1 should be shown . <p> Brightness : When this option is selected , you will be taken to a screen where you can use the slider at the top to adjust screen brightness . <p> Field of View : This setting determines your Field of View ( FOV ) , which is how much of the game world you can see at once on the screen . The FOV range possible on the slider here is between 65 and 80 degrees , with the default being 65 . Raising FOV will make more of the game world visible at once , effectively zooming out your view , while lowering it will do the reverse . Increasing your FOV may also reduce performance slightly . <h> Shadows &amp; Ragdoll <p> Shadows : This setting firstly determines whether dynamic shadows are used throughout the game . If set to anything other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowing that reacts dynamically to light sources , such as sunlight or lamps . Furthermore , as this setting is raised from Low , to Medium , to High , it will progressively increase the resolution of the shadows . <p> In the screenshots above , at Off you can see there are shadowy areas , but they are rather generic and are not an accurate depiction of the way in which the light is reacting with objects . At Low , the scene suddenly changes , as dynamic shadowing is enabled , and as a consequence , the sunlight through the leaves casts a multitude of shadows on surfaces and players . At Medium and High , the main changes are that the shadow edges become more distinct , as higher shadow resolution is used . 52011 @qwx252011 <p> The graph shows that Shadows has a marked performance impact , especially when going from Off to Low , which is when dynamic shadowing is first enabled . Subsequently , the jump from Low to Medium is small , but is more pronounced when going from Medium to High . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then Medium is a good compromise between performance and image quality . Otherwise for a big boost in FPS , turn off the Shadows setting altogether . <p> Ragdoll : This option is only available in multiplayer mode , and determines whether ragdoll physics are enabled in the game . If set to Enabled , dead bodies will be thrown about realistically based on the environment . For example , if a grenade explodes near an enemy , the body will move in reaction to the blast . If this option is disabled , dead bodies will not move around at all in reaction to various environmental forces , which can seem unrealistic at times . However , death animations are still reasonably realistic even when this setting is disabled . 52011 @qwx252011 <p> The graph essentially shows that there is no significant difference in framerates when this setting is altered . In practice , the impact may be more noticeable during heavy combat , and moreso on older systems . Generally , you can leave Ragdolls enabled , and then only turn it off if you 're getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texture Quality : Textures cover the surface of every object in the game world . The available options for controlling texture quality in Black Ops 2 are Low , Normal , High , Extra and Automatic . The higher the setting , the clearer and more defined surfaces will look in the game . Note that Automatic typically provides lower quality than Extra , as it appears to scale textures to maintain acceptable Video Memory usage . <p> The screenshots above show that at Low , the surfaces in this scene are very blurry and indistinct . The brick walls , wooden door , sandbags and tiles all look quite poor . At Normal , there is a noticeable jump in surface clarity , and again when going to High , where surface details become quite clear . At Extra , the added sharpness in texture detailing over High is difficult to see at first , but is definitely there if you look closely at the sandbags , or the cracks between the tiles for example . 52011 @qwx252011 <p> The graph shows that Texture Quality has little impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texture Quality comes from consuming more space in your graphics card 's Video RAM . As a result , if you set Texture Quality too high for your system , you may experience stuttering whenever textures are switched into or out of VRAM . If that is the case , then lower this setting to see if it improves the smoothness of gameplay . <p> Texture Filtering : This setting is designed to improve the clarity of textures that are shown at an angle to the viewer . The available options here are Low , Medium and High . The higher the filtering quality used , the crisper and more distinct surfaces will look as they recede into the distance . <p> In the screenshots above , look closely at the stack of boxes in the distance , especially the right hand side of the stack . At Low , the logos on the boxes at the far right are blurry ; at Medium , they become much clearer ; and at High , small text on the boxes also becomes more distinct . Similarly , the tiles on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the brick walls in the distance , though the change is less pronounced . <p> To ensure the highest level of texture filtering , you should also open the NVIDIA Control Panel , and under the Program Settings tab select ' Call of Duty : Black Ops II ' in the first drop-down box - select the mp . exe file for multiplayer , and the sp . exe file for singleplayer campaign . If a profile is n't shown here , untick the ' Show only programs found on this computer ' check box and try again . Scroll down and click the ' Texture Filtering - Quality ' box , and select ' High Quality ' mode , then click the Apply button . <p> Note that forcing 16x in the Anisotropic Filtering setting in the NVIDIA Control Panel will not yield any better result than using the High option for the in-game Texture Filtering in Black Ops 2 . However , if you want to make textures even more crisp , you should disable FXAA , as it can induce a slight blur over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> An indication of the performance impact of changing the Texture Filtering setting is shown below : <p> The graph shows barely any difference at the three levels of Texture Filtering quality . This is to be expected on modern GPUs , as they can handle texture filtering processes very efficiently . Start off with this setting at High , and only lower it if you are truly struggling for FPS . <h> Anti-Aliasing , TXAA &amp; FXAA <p> Anti-Aliasing : The term Anti-Aliasing ( AA ) is applied to any method used to help smooth out jagged lines , and reduce the distracting shimmering and crawling of those lines when in motion . If you do n't like jaggies , then luckily there are several anti-aliasing methods built into Black Ops 2 : Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing ( MSAA ) at sample rates of 2x , 4x , and 8x ; 16x Coverage Sample Anti-Aliasing ( CSAA ) ; and NVIDIA 's TXAA , available at 2x and 4x , which will only be shown if you have a GeForce GTX 600 series GPU . <p> TXAA is covered separately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one more built-in AA method . There are additional anti-aliasing methods available to be applied outside of the game , and these are covered in the Advanced Tweaking section . <p> In the screenshots above , we start off with no Anti-Aliasing applied whatsoever , and that includes disabling the FXAA setting . Pay particular attention to the power lines in the sky : the lack of AA is painfully obvious , and there are jagged lines aplenty . Switching on 2x MSAA gives a noticeable reduction in jaggedness , though same saw-toothed edges still remain . At 4x MSAA , the scene has been cleaned up substantially , and there 's little sign of jaggedness on any edges - except on the trees . At 8x MSAA , any improvement over 4x MSAA is hard to tell in static screenshots , but might be more noticeable during actual gameplay . Similarly , 16x CSAA looks virtually identical to 8x MSAA . Again , it should be noted that the foliage , particularly the palm tree in the center , has n't been affected at all by any level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52011 @qwx252011 <p> The graph demonstrates the progressively larger performance impact as the sample rate of MSAA is increased , culminating in a major drop when 8x MSAA is enabled . Interestingly , 16x CSAA , which as we have seen in the screenshot comparisons can look similar to 8x MSAA , performs more in line with 4x MSAA . Any form of MSAA or CSAA could be considered a luxury and not a necessity , so look to FXAA instead if you want to reduce jaggies on slower GPUs . <p> TXAA : If you have a GeForce GTX 600 series GPU capable of supporting TXAA , it will be shown as an available option here , with two choices : 2x TXAA and 4x TXAA . While TXAA is based on the MSAA technique , it goes much further in addressing a key problem : distracting shimmering , also known as temporal aliasing . In a fast-paced shooter like Black Ops 2 , anything that momentarily draws your attention away from enemies can be disastrous . TXAA helps you to smooth out the scene in motion , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the game world , and not graphical artifacts . <p> The screenshots above show that when 2x TXAA is enabled , unlike MSAA or CSAA , it smooths out both the jagged edges of buildings and objects , such as the power lines and the rooftops , as well as the rough edges on the foliage , such as those on the tree . The use of 4x TXAA further smooths out the lines in all areas of the scene , although the difference between 2x TXAA and 4x TXAA is not as significant as the jump from no AA to 2x TXAA . <p> Importantly , if Ambient Occlusion is enabled , it can cause blurriness in TXAA , or if TXAA is combined with SSAA ( as covered in the Advanced Tweaking section ) . For the best quality TXAA , make sure to disable both Ambient Occlusion and FXAA. 52011 @qwx252011 <p> The graph shows that TXAA has a noticeable performance hit , but less so than 8x MSAA , while still providing comparable image quality . Furthermore , unlike other types of AA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove jagged edges , it also removes shimmering . If available to you , it is recommended that you try TXAA to observe its benefits in motion . <p> FXAA : Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing , or FXAA for short , is a very efficient post-process technique developed by NVIDIA . If enabled , it can scrub a scene of most jaggedness with minimal performance impact , which is why it is an attractive option that is frequently included in recent games . The only real area of concern with FXAA is that it can introduce some blurriness . <p> In the screenshots above , once again we start with all forms of AA disabled . Notice that when FXAA is switched on , not only are jagged outlines such as those of the power lines cleaned up , but equally as important is the improvement in the appearance of foliage - the trees look much smoother . This is because FXAA affects jaggedness throughout an entire scene , and does n't miss anything . However , as noted , it does add some blurriness . For example , look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurred when FXAA is on . It 's very mild , and should not be cause for significant concern . Still , if you want the sharpest possible textures , then FXAA should not be used . <p> Since FXAA can also be enabled with the types of AA found under the Anti-Aliasing setting , above we compare 8x MSAA on its own , with a combination of 8x MSAA and FXAA . At first glance , the only real difference is that of the foliage , as we 've discussed . But look closely at the pipes sticking out of the roofline at the top left , or examine the roof bar on the armored transport , and you can spot the slight additional reduction in jaggedness that FXAA provides on top of 8x MSAA . Of course that has to be weighed against the slight blurring it also introduces , but basically , the smoothest and least distracting edges come from a combination of FXAA and MSAA , not just one or the other . 52011 @qwx252011 <p> The graph shows that FXAA fulfils its promise of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when enabled on a modern GPU . If the mild blurring it introduces does not bother you , it is a great alternative to the more intensive MSAA/CSAA . Furthermore , consider combining FXAA with MSAA or CSAA to get the benefit of smoother edges on foliage . <h> AO , DoF &amp; No . Corpses <p> Ambient Occlusion : A technique used to create more realistic shadowing from ambient lighting , Ambient Occlusion is described in more detail in this guide . When this option is set to On in Black Ops 2 , it will enable Screen Space Ambient Occlusion ( SSAO ) , which should provide slightly richer shadowing in various scenes . SSAO is usually a subtle but noticeable effect . <p> The screenshots above tell a somewhat confusing story , in that there does n't appear to be any real difference between Ambient Occlusion being enabled or disabled in Black Ops 2 . Aside from some moving mist in the distance , the scene is otherwise identical in terms of shadowing . <p> Importantly : Ambient Occlusion should be disabled if using TXAA or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sparse Grid Supersampling , as covered in the Advanced Tweaking section . This is because the AO in Black Ops 2 can induce additional blurriness under these AA modes . 52011 @qwx252011 <p> The graph shows that despite its hard-to-notice visual impact , Ambient Occlusion has a significant performance impact . Thus it makes little sense to enable the Ambient Occlusion in-game setting , given it has no real image quality benefit as it currently stands . <p> Depth of Field : Depth of Field ( DoF ) in gaming is an effect which makes objects in the foreground appear sharper and more distinct , and those in the background blurred and hazy . It is typically used to add a heightened sense of depth to a scene . In Black Ops 2 , the most obvious use of Depth of Field is when you are aiming down your weapon 's iron sights . The Depth of Field setting let 's you adjust how DoF works in the game , with Low providing minimal blurriness , and Medium and High adding successively more blur . <p> In the screenshots above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amount of differentiation between the foreground and the background through DoF ; everything looks reasonably clear . When set to Medium , DoF really kicks in to make everything nearer or further away from the focal point ( your crosshairs ) blurry . For example , the numbers on the iron sights , and the buildings in the distance are all hazy . At High , there is only a slight increase in the haze , otherwise it looks very similar to Medium . 52011 @qwx252011 <p> The graph shows that going from Low to Medium has a mild but noticeable FPS impact , which increases when going from Medium to High . Since DoF is mostly a matter of taste , if you do n't like the effect then simply choose Low . If you do like the effect , then there is n't much visual difference between Medium and High , so Medium should be more than sufficient without stripping too much in the way of FPS . <p> Number of Corpses : This setting controls the number of dead bodies that are visible on the battlefield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Small , Medium , and Large . The maximum number of corpses visible at any one time are 3 for Tiny , 5 for Small , 10 for Medium , and 16 for Large . In multiplayer mode this setting is unavailable , and the number of corpses is fixed at 5 . Since characters are complex objects , the more corpses that are lying around , the lower your performance in areas where they are visible . Lowering this setting means excess corpses will quickly vanish , which can improve performance at the cost of some realism . 52011 @qwx252011 <p> The graph shows that there is some performance variation at the different levels of this setting , but it is not major . In practice , this setting is highly scene-dependent . For example , if you enter an area where recent combat has piled up a lot of corpses , you may notice a slowdown in FPS which could otherwise be averted if you had a lower value for this setting . For the sake of realism , start off with Medium or Small , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowdowns in corpse-laden areas . <h> Sync , Max and Draw FPS <p> Sync Every Frame:This controls a feature that is more commonly known as Vertical Synchronization ( VSync ) . When Sync Every Frame is set to Yes , your GPU will become synchronized to your monitor 's Refresh Rate capabilities , which means your maximum framerate will typically be capped at around 60 FPS . When it is set to No , there is no FPS cap ( depending upon the Max Frames Per Second setting below ) , however you may experience a phenomenon known as " tearing " , whereby portions of the game image sometimes appear to be out of alignment ( " torn " ) across the screen . This does no harm to your system , but it can be annoying . <p> You have several options when it comes to the Sync Every Frame setting : <p> Set it to Yes to remove all tearing . However , aside from capping your FPS , this can also reduce your overall performance by up to 50% or more due to a GPU timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Set it to Yes , but also enable Triple Buffering . This will remove tearing , but without the loss in overall performance . Mouse lag may still occur . <p> Set it to No , and enable Adaptive VSync instead , available by selecting the Adaptive option under the Vertical Sync setting in the NVIDIA Control Panel . This method automatically disables VSync whenever your framerate falls below your refresh rate , preventing any performance loss , while also smoothing out framerates and minimizing tearing . Mouse lag may still occur . <p> Set it to No . This is the simplest method for providing maximum performance , removing the FPS cap and removing any mouse lag . However , tearing will be visible at times , and you may get large FPS fluctuations which can result in stuttering . To control these FPS fluctuations , use the Max Frames Per Second setting , covered further below . <p> It is recommended that in the first instance you disable this setting and try Adaptive VSync instead . If you experience any problems , or have noticeable mouse lag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next thing you can try is to disable Sync Every Frame , and use one of the options under the Max Frames Per Second setting to cap your FPS . This should reduce the incidence of tearing , as well as minimizing large FPS fluctuations , without any mouse lag or performance drop . <p> Max Frames Per Second : This option controls your maximum frames per second ( FPS ) , and is only available if you disable the Sync Every Frame setting . There are several presets for this setting , including framerate caps of 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 and 120 FPS , as well as an Unlimited setting which completely removes any cap on the framerate . Keep in mind that Max Frames Per Second only determines your maximum possible framerate ; it is not designed to attempt to maintain your FPS at an average framerate of your choice . <p> For most users , it is recommended that Max Frames Per Second be set equal to your monitor 's refresh rate , which is typically 60 . Selecting a much higher FPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FPS fluctuations in different areas , resulting in a variable feeling of responsiveness , as well as periodic stuttering . Note that in multiplayer mode , the maximum framerate is automatically capped at 200 FPS , even if you choose Unlimited here . <p> Draw FPS : If this option is set to Yes , a yellow frames per second counter will be displayed in the top right corner . Use this counter to determine whether your framerate is fluctuating significantly , or is falling to low levels during gameplay . Displaying the counter has no impact on performance . <p> That concludes our look at the in-game settings . The next section examines more advanced tweaking possibilities . <h> Advanced Tweaking <p> Call of Duty : Black Ops 2 comes equipped with a wide range of in-game settings to control its advanced DirectX 10/11 graphics functionality . Several of the settings which previously required the use of configuration file tweaks to adjust are now accessible within the in-game Settings menu . This is fortunate , because the config files in Black Ops 2 are encoded , and are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are several ways in which we can squeeze more graphical juice out of the game , and this section examines these more advanced methods in detail . <h> Other Antialiasing Methods <p> Black Ops 2 already comes equipped with four different types of Anti-Aliasing built right into the game : MSAA , CSAA , TXAA and FXAA . These should meet the needs of most players , but if you 're extremely fussy about your AA , you can experiment with other types to achieve better results . Several of these are covered below : <p> SMAA : One method of AA available to everyone is Subpixel Morphological Anti-Aliasing ( SMAA ) . This can be applied using the free injectSMAA utility . SMAA allows for similar results to FXAA in terms of smoothing jagged outlines and performance impact , but without the blurring . <p> The screenshots above show that when SMAA is enabled , jagged edges , such as those on the power lines and foliage , are smoothed . When compared to the use of FXAA in the same scene , there is one key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the restaurant sign to the left , and the palm tree in the centre ; SMAA reduces the jaggedness of these elements but maintains crispness . <p> To implement SMAA , follow these instructions : <p> Download the InjectSMAA utility . <p> Extract the files from the downloaded archive . In this case , we 're only after the contents of the d3d10 folder of InjectSMAA . <p> Move the files under this folder into the base directory of Black Ops 2 . Typically this is Program Files ( x86 ) SteamsteamappscommonCall of Duty Black Ops II . Basically it 's the same directory in which the t6sp.exe and t6mp.exe files reside . <p> Launch the game as normal and SMAA will automatically be in effect . <p> It is recommended that you disable the in-game FXAA option to prevent blurring and conflicts . <p> To toggle SMAA off/on at any time , use the PAUSE key . This may also bring up the game menu , but it enables or disables SMAA at the same time . <p> To remove SMAA completely , delete the files you moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Typically these are dxgi.dll , injector.ini , SMAA.fx and SMAA.h . <p> SSAA : Super-Sample Anti-Aliasing ( SSAA ) is a relatively performance intensive form of anti-aliasing , but a handy and effective method nonetheless . <p> The screenshot comparison above shows a scene firstly with no form of AA enabled ( including FXAA Off ) ; then with only 4x MSAA applied within the game ; then a combination of 4x MSAA and 4x Transparency Supersampling ( TRSSAA ) ; and finally , 4x MSAA with 4x Sparse Grid Supersampling ( SGSSAA ) . <p> As you can see , simply enabling 4x MSAA on its own smooths out jagged outlines on buildings and wires , but leaves foliage , such as the palm fronds on the top left , still looking quite harsh . Combining 4x Transparency SSAA with 4x MSAA smooths out the foliage as well . Instead , you may prefer using Sparse Grid SSAA , which provides a slightly sharper image due to the automatic Negative LOD adjustment now built into the latest NVIDIA graphics drivers to prevent blurring with certain SSAA modes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and SGSSAA by comparing the bark of the tree , and the thickness of the palm fronds , between the last two screenshots . <p> Importantly , as noted in the Ambient Occlusion section earlier in this guide , you should disable AO if using TXAA , or any form of Supersample AA , otherwise it will induce additional blurring in the scene . You should disable FXAA as well to prevent blurring . <p> You can enable normal Transparency SSAA in the NVIDIA Control Panel quickly and easily as follows : <p> Make sure you have downloaded and installed the latest graphics drivers for your card . <p> Open the NVIDIA Control Panel . <p> Select ' Manage 3D Settings ' in the left pane , then go to the Program Settings tab . <p> Go to ' Call of Duty : Black Ops II ' in the program list - select either the t6sp.exe profile for singleplayer , or t6mp.exe profile for multiplayer . If the game is n't shown anywhere in the list , untick the ' Show only programs found on this computer ' box and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting , select a supersample mode . In this case we will use ' 4x ( supersample ) ' . <p> Click the Apply button . <p> Launch Black Ops 2 , and to correctly enable TRSSAA , make sure that you select an MSAA setting corresponding to your SSAA sample rate . In this case , since we 've chosen 4x Transparency SSAA in Step 5 , in the game we will select 4x MSAA for the Anti-Aliasing setting . <p> You can implement other forms of SSAA , such as Sparse Grid Supersampling , by using the free NVIDIA Inspector utility . Follow the steps below : <p> Download and you have also updated your graphics drivers to the latest version , as NVIDIA Inspector requires the most recent game profiles from the latest drivers . <p> Launch NVIDIA Inspector and click the small Driver Profile Settings button ( the crossed wrench and screwdriver icon ) next to the Driver Version box . <p> In the window which opens , click the Profiles drop-down box and select ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profile is n't there , see Step 1 . <p> For ' Antialiasing - Behavior Flags ' , select None . <p> For ' Antialiasing - Mode ' , select ' Enhance the application setting ' . <p> For ' Antialiasing - Transparency Supersampling ' , select an option . In our example , we will use ' 4x Sparse Grid Supersampling ' ( 4x SGSSAA ) . <p> Click the ' Apply changes ' button at the top right to save your settings . You can close NVIDIA Inspector if you wish as it does n't need to be active for your settings to work . <p> Launch the game as normal , and set the in-game Anti-Aliasing option to an MSAA level matching the SGSSAA level that you have applied . E.g. , set in-game Anti-Aliasing to 4x MSAA if using 4x SGSSAA . This is necessary to enable SGSSAA in the game . <p> To undo these changes at any time , click the small green NVIDIA logo button at the top of the profiles screen in NVIDIA Inspector , and the Black Ops 2 profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modifications <p> If you find the InjectSMAA utility useful in applying SMAA , you might also want to consider the SweetFX Shader Suite , which is a modification of InjectSMAA . It functions on the same principle , allowing you to apply a range of post-process changes to any game . This not only includes SMAA anti-aliasing , but also changes to other aspects of the game 's visuals , like color saturation , lighting effects , and sharpening . <p> Usage of the mod is similar to the InjectSMAA tool , but you toggle the effects on or off using the SCROLL LOCK key by default , and must adjust them manually by editing the SweetFXsettings.txt file . You can even edit the settings text file while the game is running , save your changes and press the PAUSE key to update the screen with the new effects , making testing much easier . <p> SweetFX is highly configurable , and instructions are too lengthy to be covered here . Refer to the download page linked above for a full rundown . <p> The screenshots above demonstrate the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been subtly but noticeably altered using SweetFX . If you compare the two closely , you can see that the somewhat bland scene has gained a bit more " pop " through some basic changes . The graphics modified with SweetFX has much greater sharpness , better contrast , and richer colors . Of course the degree to which you modify the graphics is entirely up to your personal tastes ; what looks good to one person might look overly garish and intolerable to another . <h> Conclusion <p> Call of Duty : Black Ops 2 continues the tradition set by earlier COD games , albeit in improved form . Better graphics , more choice , a robust multiplayer and plenty of settings to play around with should keep most PC gamers happy . <p> In terms of the settings , if you 're looking for extra performance , then there 's no question that the two main areas to look at initially are Ambient Occlusion and Shadows . Ambient Occlusion provides no noticeable benefit but a steep FPS hit , so it can be disabled . Shadows , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistic dynamic shadowing , which you can do without if you need the frames . MSAA or CSAA Anti-Aliasing is also a luxury , and can readily be substituted with FXAA or SMAA for a similar look , but without the same framerate loss . If all else fails to increase your performance , then lower your Resolution . <p> If you 're having difficulties with the game , or just want to talk to other Black Ops 2 players , check the Official Black Ops 2 Forums . If you 're experiencing lag in multiplayer mode , refer to the How to Get Rid of Lag guide to correctly determine the source of your lag , and what if anything you can do about it . One final tip : you can configure the way Black Ops 2 searches for public online matches by selecting ' Find a Match ' under ' Public Match ' in the multiplayer component , then pressing the S key . Here you can select the connection type . If you select Best , it will only try to find matches to which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online experience .

@@20827189 @827189/ <h> Gears of War 4 Available Now On PC <p> Since Gears of War released 10 years ago , the series has become the stuff of legend . The original game catapulted the third-person cover mechanic into popular stardom , and Gears of War 2 and 3 refined and optimised the gameplay even further , ramping up the intensity each time . In 2013 , Gears of War : Judgement went live , and it served as a prequel to the series . Each of the games took a bold , unrelenting stance towards maintaining gut-wrenching , bloody combat from start to finish . You could dart back and forth behind the safety of obstacles , peppering your opponents from afar , or you could charge into close range , giving your enemy the business-end of your Lancer assault rifle 's underslung chainsaw . Every battle was a wonderful symphony of gore and bullets , punctuated by moments of brutal melees . <p> The first Gears of War began on the war-torn planet of Sera , where monstrous , subterranean entities called Locusts ravished the human population . Amidst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santiago led their Delta Team into the heart of the enemy to plant a powerful bomb to severely hinder the Locust threat . While somewhat successful , the Locust survived . The story continued in Gears of War 2 , where the Locust hatched a plan to sink every populated city on the globe . Marcus Fenix once again took command of Delta Squad with Dom at his side , driving onward into the Locust-controlled tunnels of Sera to exterminate them . After discovering an internal battle between the Locust and the Lambent ( a splinter species of Locust mutated by Imulsion , an unstable substance used as fuel ) , Delta Squad grimly decided to detonate the plateau of Jacinto ( one of the last thriving human outposts ) to destroy both opposing factions in one fell swoop . <p> Roughly two years after the sinking and flooding of Jacinto , Gears of War 3 had Marcus and Dom searching for Adam Fenix " Marcus 's father " who was earlier presumed dead .

Unfortunately , Adam perishes as well , leaving Marcus heartbroken , albeit victorious . <p> The Coalition 's Gears of War 4 picks up 25 long years later , where the elimination of the Locust is still popularised via propaganda materials . Humanity has started putting itself back together , complete with fully functional cities and a ruling body . However , Sera now suffers from deadly , imposing storms , and entire groups of humans start vanishing for unknown reasons at the hands of a new adversary , called the Swarm . To rescue their loved ones and unravel the mystery of their disappearances , J.D.

@@20827232 @827232/ <h> Epic Talks Samaritan &amp; The Future Of Graphics - Page 2 <p> Following a close-up of Billboard Lighting , the eponymous Samaritan is seen for the very first time . The first few shots of the protagonist highlight enhanced particle effects , localised motion blurring , and the aforementioned lighting system , but as he raises the blowtorch to his face to light a cigarette , Subsurface Scattering is seen for the first time . <p> The first glimpse of Subsurface Scattering in Epic 's Samaritan demo . <p> Designed to tackle the plastic wax ' phenomenon , whereby light hits a character and it simply bounces back , as if the character were made of plastic , Subsurface Scattering renders Forward Lighting as it hits the surface of an object , scatters throughout its interior , and exits the object at a different location . In the terms of the Samaritan demo , light hitting characters ' skin is absorbed , realistically shifted under the skin , and then emitted from a different location . For a real world example , shine a torch through a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues through from the other side and illuminates the darkness . <p> On the left , only diffuse lighting on the face ; in the middle , Subsurface Scattering ; and on the right , the two combined . Note how the final result has less of a reflective sheen and that the light spreads rather than remaining fixed in place as in the first example . <p> Subsurface Scattering was an especially important feature for Epic to implement as the human eye is trained to detect details in faces and objects for the instant recognition of threats and emotions , and research shows that the greatest barrier to in-game photorealism is the rendering of a face , and though that goes beyond lighting and modelling to include mannerisms , eye and mouth movement , and more , Epic 's advancement moves us a step closer to scaling the Uncanny Valley . There is room for improvement , however , as Epic readily admits , as technological limitations restrict the number of layers of skin light can penetrate , and also prevents light scattered from one from source being absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also highlights another major advancement , that of realistic hair . Something that games have struggled with since the first use of polygons , hair is typically rendered as a solid block with a few strands rendered separately , or more recently in big-budget games as multiple , thick , non-transparent layers . <p> To tackle this problem , Epic has created an innovative solution based upon existing mesh skinning techniques , using Camera Aligned Triangle Strips . The Vertices in these very thin triangle strips are expanded using the Vertex Shader , so 5,000 splines become 16,000 triangles , and by using a texture containing thirty-six individual hairs , the appearance of realistic hair is created , as well as a realistic beard , as seen on the Samaritan protagonist . <p> The spline ( left ) , is placed into the Vertex Shader , where it is manipulated to create a Camera Aligned Triangle Strip ( right ) to place on the character 's head or face . 5,000 splines were manipulated in this manner to create the protagonist 's hair in Samaritan . <p> The downside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines on the in-game model , which , at their least dense around the base of the beard , appear unacceptable for a modern game . The solution was to apply four times Multisample Anti-Aliasing to every object in the scene , and then apply a further Supersampling Anti-Aliasing effect to each individual hair on the protagonist 's head and face to create the smooth , realistic appearance seen in the Samaritan demo . " Unfortunately , the memory cost of MSAA is very high , " explains Epic 's Mittring. " 4x MSAA means five times more texture memory is needed , which hits a deferred renderer even harder . " Mittring is n't kidding " Epic consistently hit the limits the GeForce GTX 580 's memory capacity in the Samaritan demo , " 1.5GB . " But as can be seen in the magnified example below , the end-result is worth it , creating the most realistic hair ever seen in a game . <p> The addition of Supersampling Anti-Aliasing ( right ) results in a remarkable improvement in visual fidelity . <p> The final output , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individual hair strands has a secondary advantage , in that light can penetrate the hair and dynamically shadow each individual strand , and that said light can then penetrate the scalp and facial tissue through the use of the aforementioned Subsurface Scattering . <p> As the Samaritan demo progresses , the protagonist 's attention is caught by an altercation on the sidewalk below , where the futuristic police force of Washington D.C. are brutally assaulting a denizen of the streets . Before intervening , his skin unexpectedly and seamlessly transforms into a metallic or stone-armoured exoskeleton in the demo 's most visually impressive scene . Whereas past effects were subtle , or simply added to the level of immersion , this transformation is front and centre , and wows with its fluidity . <p> The Samaritan 's transformation . <p> This transformation was achieved through the use of Tessellation , a key feature in the latest NVIDIA graphics cards , and for Epic 's Mittring , " it was interesting to play with . " Tessellation dynamically creates new detail on a character without an additional , second character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original model swapped out . To produce this additional detail the model is tessellated , to create extra polygons that can be manipulated , and then a pre-made Displacement Map tells the model where and how to place those extra polygons , as shown in the example below . <p> The three different stages of transformation , each dictated by the displacement map , but rendered organically by the GPU 's Tessellators . <p> In the Samaritan demo , the protagonist 's face " blends between three different stages that adjust the shading and displacement over time , " explains Mittring , and to " expose the details of the texture used in the displacement map , we used higher tessellation levels . " NVIDIA 's Dudash continues , stating that the tessellation was achieved through the use of the Flat method , which is the fastest , " because we do n't do complex math for splines or other elements , " and that the level of tessellation was set to factor six when he transforms . <p> " This works for the demo , " explains Dudash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to use dynamic tessellation to reduce the tessellation factor when objects get farther away from the camera , or are not seen . In Unreal Engine 3 , enhancements will be added that enable this dynamic tessellation , " which will help to dramatically improve performance in a scene , and pave the way for full-screen tessellation of every object . <p> This is the standard Tim Sweeney , Epic 's CEO and Technical Director , sees the industry moving towards over the next however many years . <p> " I believe the industry has correctly converged on shaded triangles as a low-level surface representation , " says Sweeney , the industry 's leading graphics engineer . " Triangles are the most efficient general primitive for representing most scenes and most objects , which are largely opaque and contain well-defined boundaries . With that in mind , though , I think we 're well on our way down the REYES path , decomposing higher-order objects via tessellation . " <p> Sweeney refers to Reyes Rendering , which despite being an acronym is only written with the first letter capitalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Created in the mid-1980s by the aforementioned Robert L. Cook , and Loren Carpenter , Renders Everything You Ever Saw is a computer software architecture used in 3D computer graphics to render high-quality photo-realistic images . The company Cook and Carpenter worked at when developing Reyes was Lucasfilm 's Computer Graphics Research Group , now known as Pixar , the film studio behind the world 's most celebrated computer-rendered movies , such as Toy Story and The Incredibles . <p> Having established that Sweeney wants Pixar-level graphics , he outlines the technology he 'd require to achieve such a feat in real-time . <p> " Give us a sufficiently higher triangle rate to render multiple triangles per pixel , say 10 billion triangles per second , and we 'd use tessellation and displacement to dice every object in the scene into sub-pixel triangles -- treating it as a " free " effect , just as texture-mapping became a free effect 14 years ago . " NVIDIA 's most powerful graphics card , the GeForce GTX 590 , is only capable of 3.2 billion triangles per second , so while Sweeney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's content to " layer increasingly advanced effects on top of triangle-based scenes , such as volumetric effects , particle systems , post-processing , and so on . " <p> And that 's what Epic did with the Samaritan demo , but for their final , new effect they once again enlisted the services of NVIDIA . " One factor that can differentiate current-gen games and pre-rendered sequences is realistic ' secondary motion ' on characters , " says James Golding , Senior Engine Programmer at Epic Games . " We knew that with a character wearing such an iconic trench coat , performing acrobatic motions , this was going to be doubly important . " And so , as the protagonist jumps off the building and hurtles toward the police below , his coat fights against gravity and the forces of nature , billowing above him , before crashing to a halt on the ground in time with his own arrival . <p> Samaritan 's hero lands on top of an officer , his coat reacting realistically to the forces experienced . <p> " Games have certainly been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but given the detail we wanted to put into the graphics of the coat , we needed much more fidelity and control than we had looked at in the past . Having worked with the PhysX team at NVIDIA for many years , we decided this would be a good opportunity for our coders and artists to get to grips with their APEX clothing tech . " First seen in a game in August 2010 , Clothing is one part of APEX , a set of multi-platform , scalable frameworks that allow artists to create complex , high-level , dynamic systems without any additional programming . Offering Destruction , Particle , Turbulence and Vegetation modules , Epic 's first experiments with APEX were solely focused on the aforementioned Clothing . <p> " Clothing has some really great tools in the form of Max and Maya plug-ins that allow artists to preview the clothing behaviour right inside their tool , " says Golding , adding that " they can then adjust parameters , painting directly onto the simulation mesh , to get the right look . " Already built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides multi-threaded and GPU-accelerated simulation of the clothing mesh and deformation of the graphics mesh , " which enabled Epic to , " simulate an extremely high-poly coat model in real time . " And as is the way with new technology there are always a few kinks , so it pleased Epic to see that APEX " provides great runtime debugging tools which help us look for issues and fix them quite easily . " <p> The result is a dynamic , realistic coat that moves accurately in time with the protagonist 's motions during the climactic , action-packed scene where all the new DirectX 11 technologies combine to create a wondrous look at the future of real-time computer game graphics . As Tim Sweeney says , " everything shown in the Samaritan demo is intended to showcase both next-generation console possibilities and DirectX 11 on today 's high-end PCs , " and though he admits , " bits of it " such as cloth and some post-processing effects " are technologically compatible with current-gen consoles , " he believes that " the sheer magnitude of its usage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protagonist 's hands and face , all aspects of the scene utilize deferred rendering , resulting in a 10x performance increase . <p> As Sweeney is keen to point out , " all of these techniques are available to Unreal Engine 3 licensees and can be readily adopted in PC games today , " but more excitingly , they are readily available for anyone to use , regardless of their budget or past experience , through the Unreal Development Kit . Asked why Epic adopts such a stance , when others restrict technology to their own studios until the launch of a particular product , Sweeney states that , " given the incredible pace of progress in the industry , software releases can not afford to be a once-every-few-years phenomenon akin to Windows OS releases . Software must be treated as a living product , continually evolving and always available . " As such , Sweeney " wants to share Epic 's latest and greatest stuff with the world . " Making his point clear , he says , " From Unreal Engine 3 licensees building triple-A titles , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities , everyone can get their hands on this stuff and check it out . " <p> But what of Unreal Engine 3 's future ? Bolting on new bits to an existing framework is rarely the most efficient method of development , primarily because the underlying core structure was never designed with such add-ons in mind , and while Sweeney agrees , he 's not ready to give up on Unreal Engine 3 just yet . <p> " We 're extending Unreal Engine 3 to remain the most powerful and feature-rich engine for the duration of this hardware generation . " The next generation will arrive one day , and on that point Sweeney says , " as we move to the next hardware generation -- thinking beyond current DirectX 11 hardware to future consoles and computers with entirely new levels of performance -- we 'll combine the latest and greatest of Unreal Engine 3 with significant new systems and simplification and re-architecting of existing systems to become Unreal Engine 4 . " <p> Samaritan 's protagonist squares off against an enforcement mech shortly before the scene fades to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engine 3 is here to stay for the foreseeable future , and the fantastic new technologies outlined in this article will begin to emerge in games in the near future , though the complete package may yet be some way off . <p> We hope you have enjoyed this informative look into the DirectX 11 technology of Unreal Engine 3 , and if you have any comments please feel free to leave them on our forums .

As a first person shooter set during the Cold War , Black Ops provides both an immersive singleplayer campaign , and a fast-paced multiplayer component which should be familiar to anyone who has played previous COD games online . The aim of this guide is to allow you to better understand and best utilize the various configuration options available in the game , as well as covering the important advanced tweaks . <p> The game 's minimum system requirements are provided below , and are quite low for a modern PC game : <p> Processor : Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 / AMD Phenom X3 8750 or better <p> Memory : 2GB RAM <p> Hard Drive : At least 12 GB of free space <p> Video Card : Shader 3.0 or better ( e.g. GeForce 8600GT or higher ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows XP / Vista / Windows 7 <p> Although a dual-core CPU is accepted as the minimum requirement , this game benefits greatly from having a quad-core CPU . <p> What follows are full descriptions for COD:BO 's in-game settings , including screenshot comparisons to highlight the impact on image quality of changing the various settings . Performance information is also provided for every setting , although bear in mind that the precise impact on your particular system depends on your specific hardware combination and your other game and system-wide settings . The aim here is to give you enough information so that you can make an informed choice as to the settings you enable or disable to obtain the precise balance of visual quality and performance which is acceptable to you . <h> General System Optimization <p> Almost as important as any in-game setting is the way your Windows installation is configured . A great many problems and performance issues , especially stuttering , crashes and sudden slowdowns , can be traced directly to sub-optimal settings in Windows and out-of-date or badly configured drivers . For this reason it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TweakGuides Tweaking Companion ( TGTC ) and take the time to optimize your Windows installation correctly . At the very least make sure to update your graphics drivers to the latest available version . <h> Performance Measurement <p> To successfully conduct any tweaking , you will need some way of objectively measuring your performance in Frames Per Second ( FPS ) . The quickest and easiest way to measure your FPS in any game is to use the free FRAPS utility . Download , install and launch FRAPS before starting up COD:BO . You will now see a yellow FPS counter displayed in the corner of your screen . <p> If you do n't wish to use FRAPS , you can enable a framerate counter within COD:BO multiplayer by first making sure that under the Game section of the Settings the ' Enable Console ' option is set to Yes , then within an MP game press the key ( the key above TAB ) to open the command console at the top of the screen . Type /cgdrawfps 1 in the console and press Enter to enable the FPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by entering /cgdrawfps 0 in the console . <p> Pay attention to the FPS figure , particularly during graphically intense scenes , such as in heavy combat - if it dips into the low double or single digits for example , this is a good indication that you need to adjust various settings until your minimum FPS is consistently above 25-30 in singleplayer , and higher still ( e.g. 40FPS + ) in multiplayer given its fast-paced nature . <p> Note that in COD:BO your framerate is capped to a maximum of around 85FPS , even if you disable VSync . To learn more about VSync , and for the advanced tweak required to remove this engine cap , see the Sync Every Frame setting later in this guide . <h> Graphics <p> To access the in-game settings , launch Black Ops and select the Settings option on the main screen . The settings you can alter here are covered in detail below , but keep in mind that singleplayer and multiplayer settings are saved and applied separately from each other . <h> Graphics <p> The graphics settings have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll go through each setting and see how they affect performance and image quality . <p> In the performance graphs shown , for each setting we start with a " baseline " where all options are set to their maximum , along with 8x Antialiasing and 16x Anisotropic Filtering . From this baseline , we vary individual settings to measure their effect on performance and image quality . The test system consists of a GeForce GTX 460 1GB and Intel Core i7 940 CPU . To see how various combinations of settings work for other Nvidia GPUs in this and other games , check out the Optimal Playable Settings section of the site . <h> Full System Configuration <p> GeForce GTX 460 1GB <p> Intel Core i7 940 <p> 3GB RAM <p> Win7 64-bit <p> Nvidia 262.99 Drivers <h> Resolution &amp; Anti-Aliasing <p> This setting determines the Resolution of the game image , measured by the number of pixels horizontally and vertically ( e.g. 1920 pixels x 1200 pixels ) . The number of resolutions available here is limited by the capabilities of both your graphics card and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more detailed the image will be , with noticeably less blurriness and jaggedness . However higher resolutions also generate an increased load on your system , particularly your graphics card , and hence will reduce your overall performance . For the sharpest image on an LCD monitor , you should select the maximum available resolution here , which is also referred to as your Native Resolution . However the performance impact can be quite substantial , so if adjusting the other settings fails to sufficiently improve your performance , reduce your resolution and consider using Windowed mode to maintain a sharper image , as covered below . 52011 @qwx252011 <p> As the graph demonstrates , resolution has the largest impact on your framerate of all the settings . <h> Full Screen <p> If you want to run Black Ops in a window on your Desktop , as opposed to taking up the entire screen , then select No here . Running the game in Windowed mode can be particularly useful if you want to run the game at a lower resolution but still maintain a crisper image on an LCD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence overall stability , it is generally recommended that this setting be left at Yes unless you 're really struggling for performance . <h> Anti-aliasing <p> Anti-Aliasing ( AA ) is a technique designed to reduce the jaggedness of lines in computer graphics . The higher the sample rate of the AA selected here , the smoother lines will appear in the game . AA can be quite costly in terms of performance , especially at higher sample rates . A screenshot comparison is provided below show you the general visual impact of changing this setting . As you can see , when AA is Off , the tops of the crates on the left are jagged , as is the iron sight on your rifle ; at 4x AA this jaggedness is almost completely removed ; at 16x AA the improvement over 4xAA is almost imperceptible in a static screenshot , and would only be noticeable during actual gameplay , particularly in terms of removing the ' shimmering ' effect which comes with aliasing . <p> Since at higher resolutions COD:BO is n't a particularly jagged-looking game to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample rate for Antialiasing to get the game looking good - 4x Anti-Aliasing is more than sufficient to remove any obvious jaggedness while still giving reasonable performance . Obviously if you 're struggling for performance , AA is one of the first things you should turn Off . <p> Click to enlarge <p> For advanced users <p> By default , the Anti-Aliasing in Black Ops uses dither mode for alpha blending , which provides a good compromise between image quality and performance . You can improve the quality of AA in the game by going to the config.cfg ( for singleplayer ) or configmp.cfg ( for multiplayer ) file , found under your Program Files ( x86 ) Steamsteamappscommoncall of duty black opsplayers directory , opening it with a text editor like Windows Wordpad , and changing the seta raaAlpha " dither ( fast ) " variable to have a value of 2 ( i.e. seta raaAlpha " 2 " ) . This enables Supersampling mode which improves the quality of AA applied to objects with see-through portions at the cost of reduced performance . The default value is 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disable it altogether for improved performance at the cost of visual quality . 52011 @qwx252011 <p> The graph shows that Anti-Aliasing is second only to Resolution in the impact it can have on performance in this game . Note 16xAA is slightly faster than 8xAA here as it 's using the more memory efficient CSAA mode . <h> Aspect Ratio , Refresh Rate &amp; VSync <h> Aspect Ratio <p> This setting controls the ratio of width to height for the image displayed on your monitor . It should be left at Auto to automatically determine the correct aspect ratio for your monitor . If you find that in-game images appear distorted , such as objects or characters looking squashed , or black bars being shown around the image while playing , then manually select the correct Aspect Ratio from the 4:3 , 16:10 or 16:9 options . Refer to the chart in this Wikipedia Article for assistance . <h> Screen Refresh Rate <p> Your monitor 's correct Refresh Rate should be shown here . This is a setting determined by your monitor 's hardware limitations , and if unsure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ default - typically 59Hz or 60Hz - which is optimal . Only alter this setting if you are experiencing systematic frame skipping every second ( not stuttering ) when playing the game . <h> Sync Every Frame <p> This setting controls Vertical Synchronization ( VSync ) , which is the synchronization of your graphics card and monitor 's abilities to redraw an image on the screen a number of times each second . When Sync Every Frame is set to Yes , your GPU will be perfectly synchronized to your monitor such that your maximum FPS will be capped to your monitor 's Refresh Rate , which is controlled by the Screen Refresh Rate setting . Enabling Sync Every Frame can also reduce your FPS by up to 50% or more whenever your average FPS falls below your Refresh Rate . Furthermore , it can result in increased mouse lag . Setting Sync Every Frame to No ( VSync Off ) removes the FPS cap , reduces mouse lag , and ensures the highest performance , but at times you may experience a phenomenon known as ' tearing ' - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alignment . This does no harm to your system , but it can be annoying . A compromise solution which allows you to enable VSync without taking the performance hit is to enable Triple Buffering . <p> For Advanced Users <p> Aside from the framerate cap enforced when Sync Every Frame ( VSync ) is On , the COD:BO game engine has a built-in framerate cap of around 85 FPS regardless of whether VSync is enabled or not . This cap is not a major issue , because if you are getting around 85 FPS that is more than sufficient for smooth gameplay . However if you wish to remove this cap , you do so by going to the Program Files ( x86 ) Steamsteamappscommoncall of duty black opsplayers directory , and opening either the config.cfg file , which contains singleplayer configuration data , or the configmp.cfg file , which contains multiplayer configuration data , using a text editor like Windows Wordpad . Find the line seta commaxfps " 85 " and change the 85 to the FPS value you wish to cap the game engine to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the new cap to come into effect . Bear in mind that removing this cap can result in larger fluctuations in FPS on some systems , which may actually increase stuttering . <h> Texture Filtering &amp; Anisotropic Filtering <h> Texture Filtering <p> This setting is one of several which affects the clarity of textures . Textures are the images covering every object in the game world , giving the impression of depth and detail . Texture Filtering is designed to ensure that textures are displayed more accurately at various distances . The Bilinear method is the most basic and hence the least performance-intensive texture filtering technique , providing acceptable texture image quality . Trilinear improves texture image quality slightly at a minor cost in performance . A screenshot comparison is provided below to demonstrate the difference between these settings , and as you can see , it is difficult to see any difference at all . <p> Click to enlarge 52011 @qwx252011 <p> The graph demonstrates that the performance difference between Bilinear and Trilinear is often indistinguishable - in this case , 0.1FPS at 1920x1200 . <h> Anisotropic Filtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texture Filtering setting covered above . Anisotropic Filtering ( AF ) is an advanced texture filtering technique designed to improve the clarity of textures that are displayed at an angle to the screen , such as those covering the ground or walls when looking down a corridor . The higher the sample rate , the sharper and more detailed receding textures will appear in return for a relatively minor reduction in performance on most modern graphics cards . The screenshot comparison below compares 1x and 16x Anisotropic Filtering , and the main difference is that if you look closely , the distant tiles in the courtyard are more clearly defined at 16x AF , as well as some additional detailing being visible on the side of the car . <p> The AF level chosen combines with the filtering method selected for Texture Filtering , so for optimal texture image quality , you should select Trilinear for the Texture Filtering setting and also apply a reasonable level of Anisotropic Filtering , preferably 8x or even 16x . <p> Click to enlarge 52011 @qwx252011 <p> Although not representative of the performance impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern GPU like the GTX 460 , there is negligible performance difference , so obviously selecting 16x AF would be optimal . <h> Texture Quality &amp; Brightness <h> Texture Quality <p> This setting determines the resolution of the textures used throughout the game . The available options are Low , Normal , High and Extra , and these are demonstrated in the screenshot comparison provided below . As you can see , at Low the ground and the walls in particular are very blurry and blocky , and the detailing on the character 's uniform and the electronic equipment is indistinct ; at Normal textures are a little clearer though still blocky ; at High there is a marked improvement in texture detail ; and at Extra the textures have a nice degree of added crispness . The performance impact of changing this setting comes not so much from a reduction in FPS , but in the form of additional stuttering at higher levels of texture quality . If your GPU has relatively low amounts of Video RAM , then lower this setting to see if it helps reduce stuttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As noted , the FPS impact is not indicative of the whole story in this case , because raising Texture Quality primarily impacts on stuttering and loading pauses rather than on framerate . <h> Brightness <p> This option allows you to control the overall brightness of the game image . Changing this setting has no impact on performance , it is simply there to ensure that the image is not overly bright and washed out , and not so dark that all detail is lost in dark areas . Experiment to see which value best suits your monitor and viewing environment . <h> Shadows , Bullet Impacts &amp; No . Corpses <h> Shadows <p> If set to Yes , objects and characters will cast shadows based on the position of light sources . If set to No , characters will not cast shadows , but there will be generic fixed shadows shown for various game world objects . The screenshot comparison provided below shows the difference - with Shadows off you can see that the scene loses much of its richness and realism , as the shadows from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rubble to the right are removed or replaced by generic blobs . The shadow cast by the soldier on the left is also removed , and this removal of character shadows can be particularly noticeable in terms of reduced realism . However because shadows can also impact noticeably on performance , particularly in heavy combat where there are lots of light sources , if you 're experiencing low FPS , especially slowdowns during firefights , then Shadows should be one of the first things to turn off . <p> Click to enlarge 52011 @qwx252011 <p> The graph shows that Shadows can have a noticeable impact on performance , even at higher resolutions , and certainly much more so on lower-end GPUs . <h> Bullet Impacts <p> If set to Yes , your bullets and grenades will leave marks on the environment , such as bullet holes and scorch marks on walls . If set to No , you may experience a relatively small performance improvement in return for the removal of all such impact marks , but this also reduces realism . <h> Number of Corpses <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies are left visible on the battlefield at any one time . The available options here are Tiny , Small , Medium , and Large . The maximum number of corpses visible at any one time are 3 for Tiny , 5 for Small , 10 for Medium and 16 for Large ; in multiplayer this setting is unavailable and the number of corpses is fixed at 5 . Since characters are complex objects , the more corpses which are visible at any one time , the lower your performance will be during combat . On the other hand , realism suffers slightly if you set this to a very low value and corpses literally disappear within seconds . <h> Sound <h> Volume <p> There are five sliders here - four of them control the volume level for a particular aspect of game audio including : Voice , Music , Special Effects ( SFX ) and Cinematics . The Master volume slider adjusts the volume of all game audio . There is no performance impact from changing these sliders , so set them to suit your taste . <h> Sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio technique aimed at making sound more realistic . It does this by appropriately muffling noises which are being obstructed by solid objects . So for example , if there is a wall between you and gunfire or a grenade explosion , there should be much less aural impact than if the wall was n't there . Occlusion can be adjusted to suit your taste in singleplayer , but it may have a performance impact if enabled due to the extra audio processing involved . In practice the performance impact should be negligible on most systems with a reasonably fast CPU or sound card . <p> For advanced users <p> Unlike singleplayer Black Ops , in multiplayer there is no option for disabling Sound Occlusion . To disable it in multiplayer , you need to open the configmp.cfg file and change the seta sndlosOcclusion " 1 " variable to a value of 0 . This can provide a gameplay advantage in multiplayer , as it allows you to better hear and locate enemy gunfire and footsteps . It may also improve performance . <h> Listening Level <p> The two available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one which best suits your taste and listening environment . <h> Speaker Setup <p> The available options for this setting are ' Laptop or Small Speakers ' , ' Large External Speakers ' and Headphones . Select the one which suits your speaker configuration , or experiment to see if you experience a better audio environment with one of the other options . <h> Game &amp; Controls <h> Game <h> Subtitles <p> If set to Yes , subtitles will appear during spoken dialog ; if set to No , these are not shown . There is no performance impact , so set to suit your taste . <h> Graphic Content <p> This option is designed for those who do not wish to see or hear some of the potentially offensive elements of the Call of Duty : Black Ops singleplayer campaign . When set to Unrestricted , the game will play with all elements , including graphic content such as blood , gore and offensive language . If set to Reduced , the mature content will be reduced or removed wherever possible while maintaining the bulk of the storyline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although you can disable blood during online gameplay by changing the cgblood variable as covered under the Miscellaneous Advanced Tweaking section of this guide . <h> Controls <p> Go through each of the control sections to make sure all the controls are mapped to suit your playing style . One especially important setting can be found under the Look section : <h> Mouse Sensitivity <p> This slider controls the degree to which your mouse responds to your movements . It 's important to understand that if you are experiencing a laggy/unresponsive mouse at times during gameplay , this is typically due to either low FPS and/or because the Sync Every Frame setting is set to Yes ( VSync On ) . First disable Sync Every Frame to see if this helps , and then check your frame rate during heavy combat to determine if you are getting low FPS - if so , alter your settings to raise your minimum FPS above 20-25 for singleplayer , and preferably 40FPS or higher for multiplayer . <p> For advanced users <p> Mouse acceleration and mouth smoothing are both already disabled in Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should provide for the most accurate mouse aiming . Mouse acceleration is a non-linear ramping up of mouse sensitivity for larger mouse movements , and can make aiming with the mouse less predictable if enabled . Mouse smoothing attempts to reduce the jerkiness of mouse movements , which some people like , and some people believe feels unnatural and laggy . Both settings can be altered by editing your config.cfg or configmp.cfg file as relevant : seta clmouseAccel " 0 " - a value of 1 or higher enables successively greater amounts of mouse acceleration , a value of 0 disables it ; seta mfilter " 0 " - a value of 1 enables mouse smoothing , a value of 0 disables it . <p> You can also alter the relative sensitivity of the X ( left to right ) and Y ( up and down ) axes of your mouse by editing the seta myaw " 0.022 " and seta mpitch " 0.022 " variables respectively . Higher values make movements along that particular axis more sensitive , lower values less sensitive , and negative values invert the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Miscellaneous Advanced Tweaks <p> Advanced users can access a range of variables for altering various options not available in the in-game settings . Use a text editor like Windows Wordpad to open your config.cfg ( singleplayer ) or configmp.cfg ( multiplayer ) file found under the Program Files ( x86 ) Steamsteamappscommoncall of duty black opsplayers directory . Make a backup of each file before making any changes . <p> Many of the variables found in these files correspond with in-game settings , and those which do n't often have no impact at all when changed , as they have been deliberately disabled by the developers or are not used by COD:BO . Some of the working variables you might like to try include : <p> Click to enlarge <p> seta rdofenable " 1 " - If set to 1 , the Depth of Field effect , most commonly visible as a slight blurring of your weapon when you aim down your iron sights , is enabled . If set to 0 , this effect is removed . This is shown in the screenshot comparison above . <p> seta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " this turns off the detection of SLI systems and will have no effect if the game only has 1 GPU . When set to " 1 " the game will detect ( using NVAPI ) the number of GPUs on the system and wo n't do any SLI optimizations if there 's only 1 GPU . <p> seta rmultithreadeddevice " 1 " - This will create a D3D device with the multithreaded flag . According to the developers , this is mainly a debugging option and does n't enhance performance . <p> seta cgdrawMantleHint " 1 " - If you wish to remove the ' Press SPACE to climb over ' prompt which appears whenever you come near an object you can climb over , then set this variable to 0 . <p> seta cgbrass " 1 " - If set to 0 , disables all ejecting brass , such as expended shells from your gun . This can improve FPS when firing your weapon . <p> seta cgblood " 1 " - If set to 0 , disables blood spurts from bullet impacts . This may improve performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see blood during online gameplay . <p> seta clmaxpackets " 30 " - This setting controls the size of data packets sent to the server containing your movements during multiplayer matches . The higher this value is set , the smaller each packet size , and hence the more frequently your most recent movement data is sent to the server . General player feedback is that a higher value of 100 for this variable can improve responsiveness . <p> seta rate " 25000 " - This setting determines the rate at which packets are sent to the server . It is set based on your connection type , and the default value of 25,000 is optimal for broadband connections . However you can experiment with altering this value to see if it improves your ping . <p> seta snaps " 20 " - This setting controls the rate at which updates are received from the server . Raising this value is unlikely to have any impact given the server 's send rate is usually capped at 20 and ca n't be altered by clients , but you can still try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There are a range of other variables with tempting names that imply graphics quality changes , such as : rspecular , rblurallowed , rdistortion , and rglowallowed . In experimenting with these in both singleplayer and multiplayer , no significant visual or performance change was detected . However you may still wish to disable these variables to see if they provide you with a performance boost . <p> Note that to permanently implement some changed variables you may need to set your relevant . cfg file to read-only by right-clicking on it , selecting Properties and ticking the ' Read-only ' box . This is because the game engine automatically overwrites some changed variables with default values when the game is next launched . However be aware that making a . cfg file read-only also prevents any changes made to the in-game settings from being saved . <p> Some variables can be dynamically tested within multiplayer by using the command console . Press the key to open the console , then type the name of the command , with a forward slash / instead of seta , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disable the Depth of Field effect in the command console during a multiplayer game , type : <p> /rdofenable 0 <p> Importantly : be extremely careful what you change in the multiplayer configmp.cfg file , as altering some variables can be detected as a cheat by the Valve Anti Cheat ( VAC ) system . In particular any variable changes which result in visual or gameplay glitches that can be considered exploits may be tagged as a cheat either by VAC or by individual server admins and could result in a ban . <h> Conclusion <p> With some general system optimization , appropriate changes to the in-game settings , and a bit of experimentation with the advanced tweaks provided here , you should be able to have Call of Duty : Black Ops running smoothly on your machine . If you 're still experiencing problems , head over to the Official COD:BO Forum for assistance . <p> One final tip : if you 're relatively new to Black Ops multiplayer , you should select Play in the main menu of multiplayer , then choose the ' Combat Training ' option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bots on the various maps . It 's important to learn the layout of each map , and become familiar with each weapon and the various perks and equipment so that when you play against real people online , you do n't find the experience overly frustrating . 
@@20827245 @827245/ <h> Methodology <p> Because neither the GTX 560 nor the three titles are released , to give you a frame of reference for what the GTX 560 can do , we will outline the GPU 's Optimal Playable Settings ( OPS ) on the aforementioned games and discuss how the popular 9800 GT fairs under the same configuration . Optimal Playable Settings are specifically tailored to produce the sweet spot between the highest possible visual fidelity and smooth , playable framerates . As the average human eye can detect framerate drops below 30 frames per second , we define smooth playable framerates as anything averaging 35 FPS and above . This means that for the games below , the 560 is able to pump out at least 35 FPS average or better . <p> In an attempt to remove any technical inaccuracies , we used the same gaming rig to test both cards . Our PC components consisted of : <p> Motherboard : ASUS P8P67 WS Revolution <p> CPU : Intel Core i7 2600K @ 3.4GHz <p> Ram : 8GB DDR3 1333MHz , 9-9-9-24 <p> Operating system : Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're previewing is Duke Nukem Forever . Currently scheduled to launch internationally on June 10 , the title has been in development since 1997 and is widely considered the most long-awaited game of all time . Like the beloved Duke Nukem 3D before it , Duke Nukem Forever retains the franchise 's fun and raunchy sensibilities . A major benefit for GTX 560 owners with 3D monitors is that they 'll be able to take advantage of the fact that it 's an " Excellent " rated NVIDIA 3D Vision title . This essentially means the game was meticulously tweaked to look gorgeous in stereoscopic 3D , so if you 're looking to flaunt your 3D setup to your friends , Duke Nukem Forever would be the game to showcase , and if you already have access to a 3D Vision setup , check back in tomorrow to be able to click on the images below to be redirected to 3D Vision Live.com , NVIDIA 's 3D multimedia website , to see some of the first public 3D screenshots of the game .

James estimates he s played thousands of hours of Portal and Half- Life 2 . <p> The result was a five-minute demo at Valves offices that was anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controller down , all the work poured into REGAL and OpenGL , and all the intimate knowledge of Valves content started paying off . But Valves engineers saw enough to let James and three other engineers keep working . <p> Word quickly got around . Soon one marketing executive an inveterate Half Life 2 fanboy took it upon himself to spend hours QAing their work . A Half- Life 2 obsessive , he quickly found bugs no one else had yet found . That level of polish paid off . <p> In March , we took the covers off . NVIDIA announced Portal would be coming to SHIELD . But rather than setting off a last moment scramble , James and his team found that building a gaming experience strong enough to impress Valve meant most of the work was done . The biggest bug : one quality assurance tester found that turning on the flashlight in Half- Life 2 slowed gaming performance . After a quick patch , the game was done . <p> Big news : In March , NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang announced Portal would be coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch day that we announced we were bringing Half -Life 2 to SHIELD , too . The response went beyond just a wave of publicity . Half- Life 2 and Portal are now two of the top rated games on the Google Play Android app store . 89% of those rating Half -Life 2 on Google Play gave it five out of five stars . Portal grabbed even stronger reviews : with more than 9 out of ten giving the game five stars . " Perfect port , " wrote one user . " One of the best games ever now playable on the Shield . " <p> Most of the credit , of course , belongs to Valve . They built the game . We just made it portable . <p> half life 3 will be only on pc and next gen i sure its gon na be with valve new engine for the next gen <p> Jon Langevin <p> the graphics for HL2 and Portal are pretty sparse as-is , which is likely why those games were chosen . if anything , I 'd ask for Portal 2 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tegra note ? I 've played it on the note *by ways that others would disapprove of* and it played very well . The only thing is the bugginess of map loading *most likely because it is n't optimized for it* . If it were fixed in only that aspect , it would run perfectly . I was pretty disappointed that is was not ported for the note . <p> tyler <p> The same goes for portal <p> kathrynddaniels <p> my classmates aunt makes $68 every hour on the computer .

@@20827332 @827332/ <h> Dying Light Graphics &amp; Performance Guide <p> Dying Light is a new first-person , zombie-slaying , freerunning-filled action game from Techland , creators of the Call of Juarez and Dead Island franchises . If you played Dead Island , much of Dying Light will be familiar : there 's 4-player online co-op , weapon crafting , looting , levelling , mutated super zombies , and open-world exploration . Techland has of course refined those features extensively for Dying Light , and has expanded the scope of the game with a number of key changes . <p> Behind the scenes , Dying Light receives a technical upgrade with the introduction of Chrome Engine 6 , the latest iteration of Techland 's self-developed engine . There are new and enhanced visuals , and support for larger worlds filled with more detail . In this article we 'll examine these features , reveal Dying Light 's PC-only upgrades , show comparisons that highlight their benefits , and evaluate their performance impact . <h> Chrome Engine 6 <p> Dying Light marks the debut of Techland 's sixth Chrome Engine . Having powered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrome Engine is a proven entity , excelling at open worlds like those found in Dead Island and Dying Light . Little is known about the inner workings of Chrome Engine 6 , the only information available stating that " developers are able to create bigger and more detailed open worlds , as well as outdoor and indoor environments . " Graphics are said to be " more photorealistic than ever , with such advancements like changeable weather conditions , physical lighting model , Spherical Harmonics based Indirect Lighting , and Atmospheric Scattering . " The proof is in the pudding , so let 's take an in-depth look at Dying Light . <p> On PC , you can enjoy Dying Light at 144 FPS on your 144Hz gaming or G-SYNC monitor , and if you 've got the performance you can push it even higher . Consoles , however , are limited to 30 FPS . And should you be unsure of the best settings for your PC , GeForce Experience can automatically determine and apply optimum graphics options for your system , giving you perfect performance with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occlusion ( AO ) adds contact shadows where two surfaces or objects meet , and where an object blocks light from reaching another nearby game element . The AO technique used and the quality of the implementation affects the shadowing 's accuracy and whether new shadows are formed when the level of occlusion is low . Without Ambient Occlusion , scenes look flat and unrealistic , and objects appear as if they are floating . <p> Outside , more realistic shadowing is observed scene wide . In particular , note the unrealistic , uniform shadowing on and around foliage when using SSAO . <p> With AO disabled entirely , the difference when enabling HBAO+ is even more drastic as the interactive comparison below demonstrates . <p> Our final comparison demonstrates how crucial AO in modern games - when disabled , the detail on the wall vanishes , making it appear flat , and the cable is shown to be hanging loose , rather than flush against the wall . <p> Performance : In a wide view filled with geometry and objects , SSAO costs a little under 5 frames per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stepping up to NVIDIA HBAO+ , meanwhile , has a negligible impact on performance , and further improves fidelity . <p> With superior image quality and an extra performance cost of less than 1 frame per second , HBAO+ is the clear choice for Ambient Occlusion in Dying Light . <h> NVIDIA Depth of Field <p> NVIDIA Depth of Field ( NVDOF ) enables developers to apply high-quality depth of field rendering to their games . In Dying Light , this DirectX 11-powered effect increases the precision and image quality of depth of field blurring , and enables Techland to specify the intensity of blurring on a case by case basis . <p> Depth of Field is rendered almost exclusively during cut scenes and conversations , with no ability to toggle the setting on the fly . As such , the main menu offers the most accurate 1:1 comparison between the two available settings . <p> Performance : The extensive use of high quality depth of field blurring during cutscenes and conversations results in a significant performance impact . However , as these are non-interactive , and frame rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NVDOF is typically negated , and therefore goes unnoticed . <h> NVIDIA Percentage Closer Soft Shadows ( PCSS ) <p> A February 29th , 2016 update for Dying Light introduced support for NVIDIA Percentage Closer Soft Shadows , referred to in-game and from here on out as " PCSS " . As the technology 's name suggests , PCSS 's role is the rendering of shadows that progressively soften as the distance from the casting object increases . The result is realistic shadow rendering that better mirrors the properties of shadows in the real world , increasing image quality and immersion . <p> For examples , check out our interactive comparisons below . <p> To activate PCSS , select Very High or High on the " Shadow Map Size " setting , toggle NVIDIA PCSS On , press Enter , and then restart your game when prompted . <p> Performance : Enabling PCSS with maximum-quality shadows requires a significant amount of extra performance , especially in The Following 's huge , foliage-filled zone . To be specific , PCSS costs 19 FPS with every other setting maxed out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than Very High . The improvement is well worth the cost in our opinion , though naturally others will prefer sharp , crisp shadows - if that 's you , simply leave PCSS off , that 's the beauty of PC gaming ! <p> With numerous optimizations , improved CPU multi-threading , and many other tweaks , Dying Light now performs significantly faster than at launch . Take your system for a test drive in The Following and you 'll quite possibly have the performance to now enable additional effects and PCSS , which will make Dying Light look even better . <p> An enlarged comparison better highlights the high degree of aliasing , the impact of anti-aliasing , and the surprisingly lack of texture blur that 's typically associated with post-process anti-aliasing techniques . <p> Performance : Given its post-process technology , Anti-Aliasing has a negligible impact on performance . As such , it should be one of the first settings enabled . <p> Performance:Dying Light 's vast fields of swaying grass can have a noticeable impact on performance , as our testing reveals . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass setting to Medium , but no lower . On Low , the ground is bare in many locations , and what grass that does remain does little to improve image quality . <p> If you 're searching for extra performance , drop Shadow Quality to Medium , but we would n't recommend going any lower - on Low there 's an appreciable reduction in shadow quality in all scenes , and Very Low sees the complete loss of all shadow definition . <h> Texture Quality <p> Unfortunately , Dying Light does n't allow for Texture Quality to be changed mid-game . This , combined with checkpoint-style respawn locations and a constantly-changing time of day make direct comparisons in interesting locations impossible . From testing , it appears that there is no difference in quality between the two settings , and that High may merely be storing more textures in memory on suitably equipped GPUs . For example , running around an area on Medium resulted in a modicum of texture pop-in and VRAM usage of around 2GB . Repeating the test on High resulted in zero pop-in and VRAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gameplay sessions usage of nearly 4GB has been observed . <p> With so many variables it 's impossible to draw any definitive conclusions , so all we can suggest is that you try High and see how you fare . If there 's heavy stuttering it suggests you 've hit the limits of your GPU and need to use a lower setting . <h> View Distance <p> Of all settings , View Distance has the largest impact on performance , reducing framerates by more than half at 1920x1080 . Note : Patch 1.2.1 , released January 30th 2015 has altered the View Distance setting . Click here to learn more . <p> In many other games a View Distance setting would reduce the overall visibility of the world , adding fog to hide detail , to improve the framerate . In Dying Light , however , the world is permanently visible as the player needs to plan their parkour route from A to B. With the removal of key geometry off the table , View Distance 's attentions are instead turned towards extra , non-essential building detail , zombies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these features also fail to cast shadows at lower qualities , which in some scenes can greatly diminish image quality . <p> In the lower half of its twenty-step slider , the View Distance setting adds detail at medium and long ranges , making the aforementioned game elements visible the first time , or more visible through the addition of extra detail . In the latter half , added detail is improved in quality , and extreme distance detail introduced . From about 75% and up , many low-quality tree facsimiles are swapped for the real thing , making their up-close appearance visible at long range . This alone costs nearly 10 frames per second , and arguably reduces overall image quality because of their pixelated appearance ( fine detail does n't render well at distance at a comparatively low resolution like 1920x1080 ) . <p> The addition of extra detail does of course increase load on the GPU , but in testing we found the largest limiting factor to be the CPU . Usage of Core 1 will typically be pegged at 100% in Dying Light , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as does the framerate . Testing at other resolutions further confirms these results , with performance varying by only a few frames per second . <p> So what detail level is best ? In screenshots such as these the answer is of course 100% , but during gameplay you 'll be hard pressed to notice much of the added detail as you sprint and jump throughout the environment , especially if you enable Motion Blur . For us , 45% was the first level to offer decent-enough detail at mid range , and shadows , without egregious amounts of pop-in . Higher detail levels improve things further , but beyond 75% we noted no improvement whatsoever . In screenshots there 's a clear improvement in extreme-distance detail , but when you 're focused on lopping a zombie 's head off in-game its sole impact is a reduction in your performance . <p> Whichever setting you choose , it 's recommended you overclock your CPU for vastly improved performance . Google your CPU name and motherboard model to find countless guides , though make sure to read any and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please also note that warranties may be voided through overclocking , the upgrading of thermal interface material , or the replacement of CPU coolers . <p> Patch 1.2.1 Update <p> On January 30th , 2015 , Techland released Patch 1.2.1 , noting unspecified optimizations " that resolve many performance problems " . Investigating these changes , we have discovered a significant reduction to the maximum View Distance range , decreasing the amount of detail rendered , thereby improving performance . <p> Upon closer examination , a reduction in maximum View Distance of more than two thirds is revealed , greatly decreasing the detail of extreme-distance game elements . Compared to the launch version of Dying Light ( version 1.2 ) , Patch 1.2.1 's maximum View Distance falls between the 55% and 60% settings , which offered a good level of image quality and ran at over 45 frames per second in the game 's most demanding locations in our previous tests . <p> To demonstrate the changes , and to see if there are any other image quality tweaks that could ' optimize ' performance , we 've put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compares version 1.2 's maximum view distance against the new maximum in Patch 1.2.1 , and the other two allow you to compare the 5% and 55% View Distance settings , which use identical config file values in both versions of Dying Light . <p> The biggest changes between the old and new maximum settings can be seen in the rear and periphery of the scene . Unique buildings are simplified to reduce load , several trees are substituted for low-detail facsimiles , distant shadows are removed , shading is simplified , and fine detail is scaled back or removed . However , as noted in our original analysis , the vast majority of this detail will go unnoticed during gameplay , and on occasion the higher-quality distant detail is less distinctive and appealing at 1920x1080 . <p> At medium range , cables used by the player to traverse between buildings are hidden , which may make pre-planning a path from the screenshot 's location more difficult . Additionally , some geometric detail is slightly scaled back , near-indistinguishable shadows are removed , the quality of some foliage is reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lower right are also reduced . <p> At 5 and 55% , we see clear improvements to the sharpness and clarity of distant detail in version 1.2.1 . In particular , note the clarity and detail of windows and building textures in the general vicinity around the quest log , in the center of the screen three streets back , and to the left amongst the many buildings . In all other regards , though , the scenes are identical . Whether the result of a bug fix or an improvement to the LOD system , the sharper detail is appreciable at medium range , particularly on large surfaces such as those around the quest log . <p> You can check out a complete set of View Distance screenshots for each version of the game below , enabling you to see the fidelity of each detail level in both versions of the game . For performance information , and to discover how to apply the old View Distance settings to Patch 1.2.1 , keep on reading . <p> The result is a 8.1 FPS improvement at 5% View @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Distance , the two View Distance settings that display identical amounts of detail pre and post patch . Other detail levels sport similar ' VisRange ' values in config files , and as you can see from the table below performance is improved across the board . <p> Note , outside of our bottlenecked test scene we 're seeing significantly improved performance from higher GPU usage , though the extent of the improvement will vary with the power of your particular graphics card . Here however we 're investigating the worst case scenarios that are regularly encountered in the game 's second open-world location . <p> - <p> v1.2 VisRange <p> v1.2 Performance <p> v1.2.1 VisRange <p> v1.2.1 Performance <p> View Distance 5% <p> 1.40 <p> 79.9 FPS <p> 1.40 <p> 88.1 FPS <p> View Distance 10% <p> 1.40 <p> 79.8 FPS <p> 1.50 <p> 86.2 FPS <p> View Distance 15% <p> 1.41 <p> 78.2 FPS <p> 1.60 <p> 79.9 FPS <p> View Distance 20% <p> 1.43 <p> 77.6 FPS <p> 1.70 <p> 76.8 FPS <p> View Distance 25% <p> 1.46 <p> 77.1 FPS <p> 1.80 <p> 73.1 FPS <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 71.2 FPS <p> View Distance 35% <p> 1.62 <p> 70.9 FPS <p> 2.00 <p> 69.4 FPS <p> View Distance 40% <p> 1.74 <p> 68.8 FPS <p> 2.10 <p> 67.4 FPS <p> View Distance 45% <p> 1.91 <p> 63.9 FPS <p> 2.20 <p> 66.7 FPS <p> View Distance 50% <p> 2.13 <p> 60.3 FPS <p> 2.30 <p> 64.1 FPS <p> View Distance 55% <p> 2.40 <p> 56.5 FPS <p> 2.40 <p> 62.4 FPS <p> View Distance 60% <p> 2.73 <p> 53.8 FPS <p> 2.50 <p> 60.9 FPS <p> View Distance 65% <p> 3.13 <p> 50.2 FPS <p> 2.60 <p> 60.1 FPS <p> View Distance 70% <p> 3.60 <p> 47.9 FPS <p> - <p> - <p> View Distance 75% <p> 4.14 <p> 46.1 FPS <p> - <p> - <p> View Distance 80% <p> 4.78 <p> 43.6 FPS <p> - <p> - <p> View Distance 85% <p> 5.50 <p> 42.5 FPS <p> - <p> - <p> View Distance 90% <p> 6.31 <p> 41.5 FPS <p> - <p> - <p> View Distance 95% <p> 7.23 <p> 40.4 FPS <p> - <p> - <p> View Distance 100% <p> 8.26 <p> 39.7 FPS <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VisRange , but we 've discovered that the old VisRange values can be applied to Patch 1.2.1 . Here 's how : <p> Configure all game settings to your liking in Dying Light . Quit the game . <p> Open LONG ... using Notepad++ or a similar application . <p> Change the VisRange value to VisRange ( 8.26 , 8.26 ) for maximum pre-patch graphics , or use any of the other numbers from the table above . Note , both numbers must be the same . <p> Save the file , go back into its folder , right click it , select Properties , click Read Only , click Apply , close window . Note : after setting the file to Read Only , any further changes to the graphics options in-game wo n't apply properly , or will be undone when you next open Dying Light . <p> Reopen Dying Light , enjoy the increased View Distance . <p> Using this method , we tested 8.26 VisRange , the old maximum , and found it to run at 44.5 FPS , a 4.8 FPS improvement . Given that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that several bottlenecks are still present , this is an excellent start , increasing performance and making Dying Light playable on systems with older and slower CPUs . <p> Patch 1.4.0 Update <p> On February 14th , 2015 , Techland released Patch 1.4.0 , stating that the new update included further optimizations , memory usage reductions , and a variety of other changes . <p> Put to the test , these new optimizations gave us 5 extra frames per second in our CPU bound trouble spot , and even faster framerates with the CPU-hungry View Distance setting turned down . Combined with the new GeForce Game Ready 347.52 WHQL drivers , Patch 1.4.0 performance in our benchmark location with 8.26 View Distance is now 12 frames per second faster than it was three weeks ago , and at 2.60 VisRange it 's nearly 20 FPS faster . <p> Dying Light : The Following - Enhanced Edition <p> Since the release of Patch 1.4.0 , further updates and tweaks have been released , culminating in the launch of Dying Light : The Following - Enhanced Edition . A re-release of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edition contains the original game , The Following , a new campaign in a new zone , gameplay enhancements for owners of all versions of the game , and additional graphics and performance optimizations . Included with the graphics updates are remade character models , changes to foliage density and visibility , and a few other tweaks and improvements . <p> Together , the many changes have further improved image quality and performance , so if you ever had issues running Dying Light in the past it 's worth taking another look at this great game . <h> NVIDIA Control Panel Anisotropic Filtering <p> If you wish to sharpen distant textures and those viewed on an angle , forcibly enable High Quality Anisotropic Filtering ( AF ) via the NVIDIA Control Panel , like so : <p> Improvements are particularly evident in The Following , where wide-open fields and distant views of foliage-free surfaces can be seen throughout . <h> NVIDIA Control Dynamic Super Resolution <p> To amp up your graphics even further , activate Dynamic Super Resolution ( DSR ) to receive up to 4K-quality graphics on your HD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as Dying Light , are rendered at a higher , more detailed resolution , and the image intelligently shrunk back down to the resolution of your monitor using a custom-made filter , giving you up to 4K-quality graphics on your screen .

As with Texture Quality , however , Dying Light prevents resolution changes during gameplay , making representative comparison screenshots impossible to capture . If you 've used DSR in other games you 'll know of its benefits already , and hopefully require little convincing of its benefits in Dying Light . <p> After updating , open GeForce Experience 2.2.2 and click ' Check For Updates ' on the Preferences tab to get a new Game Ready Dying Light SLI profile , which should improve performance on multi-GPU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to configure your own profiles , the SLI bits to use are 0x080000F5 .

@@20827335 @827335/ <h> Antialiasing and Anisotropic Filtering <p> PreviousNext <h> Anisotropic Filtering <p> Anisotropic filtering improves the clarity and crispness of textured objects in games . Textures are images containing various types of data such as color , transparency , reflectivity , and bumps ( normals ) that are mapped to an object and processed by the GPU in order to give it a realistic appearance on your screen . At its native dimensions , however , a typical texture is far too computationally expensive to unconditionally reuse in a scene because the relative distance between the texel ( a pixel of a texture ) of the object and the camera affects the observable level of detail , which could easily translate to wasted processing time spent on obtaining multiple texture samples that are applied to a disproportionately small surface in the 3D scene . To simultaneously preserve performance and image quality , mipmaps are used ; mipmaps are duplicates of a master texture that have been pre-rendered at lower resolutions which a graphics engine can call when a corresponding surface is a specific distance from the camera . With proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene can have no discernable impact on its appearance while greatly optimizing performance . <p> Due to the dimensions of mipmaps conventionally being a power of two or smaller than the original texture , there exist points where multiple mipmaps may be sampled for a single texel which must be compensated for by the filtering method in use to avoid blurring and other visual artifacts . Bilinear filtering serves as the default , being the simplest and computationally cheapest form of texture filtering available due to its simple approach:to calculate a texel 's final color , four texel samples are taken from the mipmap defined by the graphics engine at the approximate point where the target texel exists on-screen , which will appear as a combined result of those samples ' color data . While this does account for distortions in texture angles , bilinear filtering takes samples exclusively from the mipmap identified by the graphics engine , meaning that any perspective-distorted texture lying at a point where two different mipmap sizes are called results in the displayed texture containing pronounced shifts in clarity . Trilinear filtering , the visually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mipmaps by continuously sampling and interpolating ( averaging ) texel data from the two closest mipmap sizes for the target texel , but this approach along with bilinear filtering both assumethat the texture is displayed as square with the camera and thus suffers from quality loss when a texture is viewed at a steep angle . This is due to the texel covering a depth longer than and a width more narrow than the samples extracted from the mipmaps , resulting in blurriness from under- and over-sampling respectively . <p> Anisotropic filtering exists to provide superior image quality in virtually all cases at the slight expense of performance . By the computer science definition , anisotropy is the quality of possessing dissimilar coordinate values in a space , which applies to any texture not displayed as absolutely perpendicular to the camera . As previously mentioned , bilinear and trilinear filtering suffer from resultant quality loss when the sampled textures are oblique with the camera due to both methods obtaining texel samples from mipmaps assuming that the mapped texel is perfectly square in the rendered space , which is rarely true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mipmaps are isotropic , or possessing identical dimensions , so when a texel is trapezoidal there is insufficient sampling in both directions . To solve this , anisotropic filtering scales either the height or width of a mipmap by a ratio relative to the perspective distortion of the texture ; the ratio is dependent on the maximum sampling value specified , followed by taking the appropriate samples . AF can function with anisotropy levels between 1 ( no scaling ) and 16 , defining the maximum degree which a mipmap can be scaled by , but AF is commonly offered to the user in powers of two : 2x , 4x , 8x , and 16x . The difference between these settings is the maximum angle that AF will filter the texture by . For example : 4x will filter textures at angles twice as steep as 2x , but will still apply standard 2x filtering to textures within the 2x range to optimize performance . There are subjective diminishing returns with the use of higher AF settings because the angles at which they are applied become exponentially rarer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panel within the 3D Settings section , however for the best performance and compatibility NVIDIA recommends that users set this to be controlled by the application . <h> Anti-aliasing <p> Anti-aliasing , or " AA " for short , is a rendering technique used to minimize the prevalence of aliasing , a type of visual artifact that looks like the steps on a stair , on any non-perpendicular edges of objects in a 3D scene . Aliasing is a consequence of an integral operation in the modern 3D rendering pipeline : rasterization , or the process of translating an image of nearly infinite detail to a discrete pixel matrix ( the monitor . ) This process has a propensity to create visible inconsistencies in edge continuity due to the GPU only coloring a pixel if the line passing through it occupies more than half of the space , resulting in a jagged edge where our eyes would normally expect a smooth contiguous line . <p> In the same fashion as anisotropic filtering , there are multiple approaches to this technique that carry certain advantages and disadvantages , however the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve the same effect : producing an intermediary color for a single pixel based on sampling neighboring sub-pixels ( virtual pixels that are rendered by the GPU but not displayed on the screen ) to generate a more realistic edge for an object , but the differentiation between them is made by how those methods obtain the final color . <p> Supersampling is a brute-force AA method that calculates a pixel 's color by forcing the GPU to oversample the frame , or render it at dimensions equal to the resolution times the sampling rate ( ex. : native resolution of 1680x1050 * 4 samples = 6720x4200 , ) and obtaining color data from samples around a target pixel before downsampling ( reducing ) the frame to its original size . After the frame has been reduced a negative level of detail biasis applied to sharpen a sampled object 's textures to counteract the blurring that downsampling and pixel merging produces . Supersampling is a type of full-scene anti-aliasing , meaning that every pixel in the frame is sampled and corrected rather than just those lying on the object 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at an enormous cost to performance due to the GPU being required to compute so much additional information . The supersampling anti-aliasing modes are not available through the NVIDIA Control Panel . <p> Multisampling still oversamples the frame ( renders at a larger resolution ) in the same fashion as supersampling , but to conserve processing time each sub-pixel inherits the color value from the sample pixel and only assigns unique depth values to the sub-pixels ( whereas supersampling calculates individual color/depth values . ) With the GPU being aware of which pixel will be displayed when the frame is downsampled , the final color is calculated by evaluating the depth values : if the sub-pixel depths are inconsistent , the pixel is lying on the edge and will be colored by altering the opacity of the pixel by accounting the number of samples taken and the number of sub-pixels that had different depth values ( which for 4x would be 100% , 75% , 50% , 25% , and 0% . ) This method comes with a substantially lower performance requirement than supersampling while still providing acceptable frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3D games . <p> Multisampling can be forced at several sampling rates ( 2x up to 16x ) through the NVIDIA Control Panel within the 3D Settings section , however for the best performance and compatibility NVIDIA recommends that users set this to be controlled by the application .

@@20827354 @827354/ <h> Info 52010 @qwx252010 <p> Sequel to the critically-acclaimed PC RPG of 2007 , The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings promises to be bigger , better , and more beautiful than its predecessor . Based on fantasy novels written by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski , The Witcher 2 has players once again taking control of bad-ass " witcher " Geralt of Rivia . For those unfamiliar with Sapkowski 's fiction , witchers are monster-hunters who have received special training and have had their bodies modified at an early age to receive supernatural powers . Whereas the first game used a modified version of BioWare 's Aurora engine ( originally used in 2002 's Neverwinter Nights ) , developer CD Projekt RED has designed a new game engine ( called the " RED Engine " ) specifically for The Witcher 2 . With this new custom-built modern engine , the game now features high-resolution textures , increased polygon count for character models , and lush , detailed landscapes . Taking place across a wide variety of environments , players will traverse through beautiful countryside forests , rural villages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds an extra level of immersion while SLI provides enhanced performance with scaling often above 90% . Tying the rest of the presentation together are the mature storyline , stellar voice acting , and epic narrative . Featuring non-linear dialogue trees and branching options , The Witcher 2 offers many morally ambiguous choices which empowers gamers to play the game through several times for vastly different experiences . Taking place shortly after the events of the first game , The Witcher 2 strikes a fine balance of rewarding gamers who played the original while being engaging and comprehensible enough to be a standalone title . Making the storyline more enjoyable is the vastly improved combat system . Gone are the numerous cumbersome attack stances . What has replaced the more static " wait-and-click " fighting system of the first game is a more streamlined console-like control system . The left mouse button initiates light attacks , the middle scroll mouse button enables players to use a wide variety of spells , and the right mouse button allows players to swing for the fences with fierce combos .

While the game features greatly improved combat , The Witcher 2 is still a role-playing game at heart . This means that gaining experience and leveling up is important as it ever was ; as a matter of fact , the RPG mechanics have also received an overhaul . One thing that was lacking in the original game pertained to loot drops . That problem is no longer an issue as The Witcher 2 features numerous items to pick up and allows players to greatly customize weapon , gear , and armor .

@@20827355 @827355/ <h> Rise of Immortals Interview : Free-To-Play , 3D-Enabled MOBA Launches <p> September 13 , 2011 <p> By Andrew Burnes <p> The Massively Online Battle Arena genre is one of the fastest growing segments of the PC gaming market , and now there 's a new contender vying for your attention : Rise of Immortals . Read on to learn all about the newly-released game , the MOBA genre in general , and how Rise of Immortals ' use of 3D Vision can possibly give you an edge . There 's even some exclusive info about forthcoming Immortals and new additions to the free-to-play title ... <p> GeForce.com : Today we 're speaking with Petroglyph Games , a strategy specialist formed by members of Westwood Studios , the developer behind Command &amp; Conquer , the best-selling , much-loved game that popularized the entire real-time strategy genre . Could you introduce yourself please ? <p> Hi , I 'm Steve Wetherill , Producer on Rise of Immortals . I was also Technical Director on the original Command &amp; Conquer , so I have quite a history with the genre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've just launched Rise of Immortals , a free-to-play Massively Online Battle Arena game . For those unfamiliar with the genre , could you please give us a general overview of how they 're played and what a MOBA match entails ? <p> Steve Wetherill : MOBA 's are typically team-based Player versus Player games . Teams are up to 5-players , and the battle is enacted on a map with several lanes connecting the team bases . Teams consist of heroes such as melee weapon-wielders , ranged spell-casters , armored tank-characters and combinations thereof . Players vie for control of the lanes , using friendly autonomous minions ( " creeps " ) and towers for cover while they jab and poke at enemy heroes and try to land killing blows on enemy creeps in order to gain gold and experience . Control of lanes is established by pushing enemy towers and moving the battle line toward the enemy base . Ultimately , the victor is the team that destroys the enemy base . <p> Check out the Rise of Immortals launch trailer for some in-game PvP footage . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and available MOBA games , most of which are all very similar to Defense of the Ancients , the first ever MOBA game , developed for Blizzard 's WarCraft III as a mod . To differentiate yourself and to innovate in a genre full of similar titles you 're doing some interesting things with the characters and player progression , I do believe ? <p> Steve Wetherill : Yes , we 've placed much more emphasis on an Immortal-centric meta game ( in RoI the heroes are referred to as Immortals ) , with persistence on experience level , and items such as Artifacts and potions attached to the Immortal rather than to the player account . Players can level each Immortal to persistent level 50 , unlocking their signature at level 21 and unlocking progressive tiers of Artifacts - persistent items that provide ability and stat boosts . Additionally , each Immortal has a unique discipline tree , into which players can sink discipline points ( earned by increasing persistent level ) to provide further boosts for base stats and abilities . <p> Despite controlling only one character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . <p> GeForce.com : In addition , you 're allowing players to socialize in in-game hub areas , whereas in most MOBAs players are kept isolated from one another , and are only able to interact on official forums where names may be different . Do you foresee these hubs helping players find new compatriots to group up with and perhaps help alleviate some of the player hostility that is often associated with MOBAs because of the highly-strung gameplay where mistakes can turn the tide of entire matches ? <p> Steve Wetherill : During our beta period , we 've seen a definite benefit arising from this increased socialization , with interactions between players extending beyond the game into the forums . Our community has been noticeably more considerate to newer players than you might see elsewhere , and many beta players have commented how friendly the forums are compared to other games . Perhaps players are held to be more accountable when they are not just a name in a list . We 've also seen players rise to become champions of the game ( helping new players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-game social hub is empowering in this respect . <p> The Rise of Immortals social hub in action . <p> GeForce.com : Speaking of hostility , the main root of such strife in MOBA matches is due to inexperienced players or those deliberately griefing or trolling " does Rise of Immortals have a training facility for players to learn the game or other methods of people learning to play , such as co-op versus A.I. ? And what of the aforementioned troublemakers , how will they be dealt with and kept from the rest of your players ? <p> Steve Wetherill : We 're rolling out a full tutorial during launch week , and in addition to that we have a practice scenario ( a simplified map with 1 player vs an AI bot ) . There are also 3vBot scenarios that are enabled periodically depending on server population , and we 're testing other scenarios such as 1+2botV3bot in which you play cooperatively with two bots against three enemy bots . We have some pretty interesting ideas for new scenario types , some of which will hopefully be released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have various means by which we can control player access to the game , and while we do n't yet have in-game player reporting tools , we do have a network of community moderators who have eyeballs on the hub and forums , so we get good coverage that way . <p> GeForce.com : For those who have prior MOBA experience , does Rise of Immortals feature any unique elements on the Player Versus Player map , or other unique elements elsewhere within the game that we have yet to touch upon ? <p> Steve Wetherill : With PvP , we aim to deliver a competitive , responsive gameplay experience that will be familiar to players of other MOBA games . Aside from the meta game differences , and how they feed into ability and stat upgrades , other unique elements of PvP include the item store and upgrade system , which is very streamlined compared to other MOBA 's ; the ability to upgrade tactical abilities based on persistent level ( through the Immortal branch of the discipline tree ) ; One of our other differentiators is the 3vE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team together in an encounter based scenario with AI bots and other MOBA-like elements . <p> GeForce.com : As mentioned earlier , Rise of Immortals will be free-to-play , allowing everyone to try the game without charge , which in turn will hopefully enlarge the player base . Game development does cost money of course , and any game is intended to enter into profitability , so how will Rise of Immortals be monetized and what are you doing to ensure that those utilizing real-world money wo n't have an in-game advantage ? <p> Steve Wetherill : At launch , we start with 12 Immortals . Of those 12 , 8 are " unlocked " so that you can play them without buying them . The remaining 4 can be unlocked using either Prestige Points ( earned currency ) or Petroglyph Coins ( Real Money Trading ) . Prestige Point and Petroglyph Coin balances are account-wide , so by playing the unlocked Immortals you can earn enough Prestige to unlock new Immortals . Each Immortal has a selection of skins at launch , skins are unlocked with Petroglyph Coins only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlock skins for it . In addition to skins , players may buy XP and Prestige boosters as well as Artifacts using Petroglyph Coins . <p> We expect to see players level their Immortals much more quickly in this game than in an MMO , for example - players should be able to get to end game levels within a few weeks on a given Immortal without boosts , and so while a player can power-level by spending money on artifacts and XP boosts , in reality all that happens is that that player will attain end-game level more quickly . Player skill is by far the most significant factor in how well a player at a given level will perform in-game . <p> GeForce.com : Technologically , MOBAs are deliberately designed to be scalable to allow anyone to play from almost any piece of hardware , though you are catering to high-end gamers also by including full NVIDIA 3D Vision support " how does stereoscopic 3D add to the experience ? <p> Steve Wetherill : Stereoscopic 3D adds an amazing depth to the gameplay , the technology is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think there 's also a gameplay benefit in that objects tend to " pop " out of the backgrounds which can really help when there is a lot happening on screen at once , but it 's certainly not disruptive the gameplay like you occasionally see 3D objects in movies being thrown at you . <p> Rise of Immortals ' graphics are far superior to any other MOBA title currently on the market . <p> GeForce.com : What 's next for Rise of Immortals " do you have specific plans in mind to evolve the game , or will you react to what your players want and ask for ? <p> Steve Wetherill : We have plans to release new Immortals at a pretty aggressive pace - at least one per month . In fact , in our launch month we 'll be releasing Talia and Trovoc , neither of which has previously been announced ! In addition , I as touched on before , we have ideas for a whole bunch of new scenario types that make complete sense with this sort of gameplay setup and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to that , we have a list of activateable tactical items that we have been keeping under wraps . <p> Outside of the game itself , we 're looking carefully at supporting territories outside the USA - we 'd love to get local servers for Europe , South America and the Asia Pacific region . <p> You heard it here first , new Immortals and " activateable items " are coming soon to the game . <p> GeForce.com : Thank you very much for your time ; do you have any final words or comments you wish to make about Rise of Immortals ? <p> Steve Wetherill : It 's been my pleasure to chat about Rise of Immortals ! As you mentioned , we just launched on September 12 . I encourage everyone to visit to create a free account and join us in the game . The developers will be in the game around 5pm PST most days , so we 're looking forward to seeing you in the social hub !

Of these new features , Dynamic Super Resolution ( DSR ) will have largest impact , enhancing any game that supports resolutions above 1920x1080 . What does DSR do ?

DSR drastically improves upon this process by applying a high-quality filter specifically designed for the task . DSR also makes the process simpler with on/off integration built directly into GeForce Experience and It 's compatible with all monitors , removes the need for technical know-how , and is integrated into GeForce Experience 's Optimal Playable Settings . <p> In Dark Souls II 's opening scene , players find themselves surrounded by swaying grass .

@@20827384 @827384/ <h> Grand Theft Auto V PC Graphics &amp; Performance Guide <p> Grand Theft Auto V needs no introduction . It 's the one of the best-selling titles of all time , and the highest-rated game of the past decade . Now , the highly-anticipated , definitive PC edition has arrived , so join us as we dissect Rockstar 's record-breaking open-world action game to reveal the technological treats that await amongst its many , many graphics settings . <h> System Requirements <p> Grand Theft Auto V 's official system requirements are posted below , indicating how scalable Rockstar 's action game is . At its lowest levels , it can run on a potato ; at console-quality detail levels you 're looking at the Recommended Specifications . At true max quality graphics , however , you 'll need something far faster . <h> A Note On Benchmarking &amp; Testing <p> Two seconds are never the same in Grand Theft Auto V 's Los Santos and Blaine County , where trees sway , unscripted events occur , and the inhabitants are randomly generated . These features help create the appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparisons and benchmarking somewhat tricky . To counteract these variations , multiple passes of each benchmark have been run , and multiple benchmark locations identified for each setting . <p> For these , we took to Quick Saves , Director Mode and gameplay scenarios to replicate expected in-game performance , but on occasion we had to use the in-game benchmark . However , in this benchmark , each pass of its four scenes can vary greatly , generating results - 5 frames per second faster or slower from test to test . In an attempt to mitigate the impact of these variations , we generated a max setting baseline using ten runs of the in-game benchmark , averaged into one result . Then , to evaluate the impact of specific settings , we ran five further passes per detail level of each option , again averaging results , revealing their performance impact as accurately as possible . <p> For visual comparisons between restart-required settings that were otherwise impossible to accurately test during gameplay , additional benchmark runs were recorded using GeForce Experience 's ShadowPlay at the highest birate possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute videos from which stills were captured . Again , some variance is seen , but we believe this to be the most accurate way of capturing the true impact of these settings . <p> Regarding the results presented in this guide , expect to see a decrease in relative performance between detail levels on your system if you 're using a previous-generation GPU . For example , GeForce GTX 900 Series GPUs are faster at anti-aliasing and tessellation tasks than previous-generation GPUs , and so the performance impact between FXAA and MSAA , and tessellation off and on , will be lower on these newer cards . <p> Finally , please note that while the in-game benchmark is the best way to determine the performance impact of individual settings , it is n't representative of a player 's experiences during five-star action scenes and when traipsing through heavily forested areas that can crush performance . As the only reliable way for gamers to test performance , though , here 's a handy tip : whatever result the benchmark gives you , halve it for a better indication of frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaming with twenty-nine others in Grand Theft Auto Online . <p> On the left of our interactive comparison is " AMD CHS " ( Contact Hardening Shadows ) , a technique that " dynamically hardens or softens a shadow 's edges depending on the distance of the shadow from the light source and object casting that shadow " , enabling " softer shadows that diffuse more realistically " . On the right is " NVIDIA PCSS " . Both cast shadows superior to the default options , " Softest " , " Softer " , " Soft " , and " Sharp " , but only PCSS offers a true approximation of shadows as seen in the real world . <p> In the following example , note how PCSS shadows cast from across the street onto the ivy next to the bins avoid unnaturally darkening the foliage . Furthermore , shadows cast through the tinted window of the shop diffuse accurately . <p> For best PCSS results , also enable the following settings to ensure high-quality shadows are cast on all game elements , and are seen at long range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Very High <p> Shadow Quality : Very High <p> Grass Quality : Ultra <p> High Resolution Shadows : On <p> For details about the above settings , keep on reading . <p> Performance:Grand Theft Auto V is full of shadows , each cast from different distances and heights . By enabling NVIDIA PCSS these shadows accurately reflect the position of their caster , greatly improving the realism of the world . <p> With every other setting maxed out , the cost of Soft Shadows is 6.4 frames per second at the very most ; a comparatively low number given the improvement to every single scene . <h> NVIDIA TXAA Anti-Aliasing <p> NVIDIA TXAA is a custom-developed anti-aliasing ( AA ) technique designed to tackle temporal aliasing , the movement of anti-aliased edges when the player 's camera or view point is in motion . Commonly referred to as crawling or shimmering , temporal aliasing is a particular eyesore in games with fine detail and numerous moving elements , as can be found in abundance in Grand Theft Auto V. Combining Multisample Anti-Aliasing ( MSAA ) with a custom CG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this temporal aliasing whilst simultaneously anti-aliasing geometry better than 8x MSAA . <p> In Grand Theft Auto V , TXAA is offered alongside MSAA and FXAA , giving gamers a total of seven anti-aliasing options to suit their system 's performance , and their personal tastes . Below , the seven options are compared in a series of interactive comparisons ( note , to enable TXAA , MSAA 2x or 4x must be selected first , then TXAA set to " On " ) . <p> During gameplay when everything and everyone is in motion , temporal aliasing is more noticeable than edge aliasing , as it is in every other open world game . And as discussed , TXAA is the only option for removing it . In stills such as these , however , we can only examine image quality : with FXAA there 's little in the way of AA in some cases , corruption on smaller game elements and distant details , and blur on the odd surface . MSAA , meanwhile , introduces outlines ( shader aliasing perhaps ) on certain game elements and fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TXAA , though to a lesser degree . <p> Often , we advise the MSAA users to also enable FXAA , adding effective anti-aliasing to alpha textures , which are used to render foliage , chain link fences , and other fine detail that would be expensive to render as geometry . In this case however , Grand Theft Auto V appears to employ a shader or additional post-process pass , similar to " Multisample Alpha Test " in World of Warcraft , which anti-aliases alpha textures when using MSAA . The benefits of this welcome addition can be seen in the interactive comparison below . <p> If you have a GeForce GTX 600 , 700 , 800 , or 900 Series Kepler or Maxwell , desktop or mobile GPU , TXAA is the anti-aliasing option of choice , effectively removing temporal aliasing , one of the most unsightly artifacts in any game . For the best results , combine TXAA with Dynamic Super Resolution ( DSR ) to eliminate any remaining aliasing . <p> If you lack the necessary hardware for TXAA , your best bet is DSR in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MSAA at a lower resolution . <p> Anti-Aliasing benchmarks will be posted following the conclusion of new tests on the April 21st game update . <h> Additional Graphics Settings <h> Ambient Occlusion <p> Ambient Occlusion ( AO ) adds contact shadows where two surfaces or objects meet , and where an object blocks light from reaching another nearby game element . In Grand Theft Auto V though , the setting 's a tad bugged , and is awaiting a fix to restore full functionality . Enterprising gamers , however , have found a workaround : change the Ambient Occlusion setting , Apply , change PostFX to Normal , Apply , change PostFX back to Ultra ( or its previous value ) . <p> Using this method , we can now demonstrate the benefits of Ambient Occlusion High and Off , though Normal still appears non-functional , having zero impact on image quality . Rest assured , we will return to Grand Theft Auto V 's Ambient Occlusion setting for a proper evaluation once an official fix is issued . <h> DirectX <p> Grand Theft Auto V offers players the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and DirectX 11 . DirectX 10 and DirectX 10.1 are included primarily for compatibility purposes , enabling those with older GPUs lacking DirectX 11 support to play the game . But you may be wondering if they 're any faster , despite DirectX 11 generally being better optimized and having a superior feature set , and DirectX 11 game support being frequently fine-tuned through regular GeForce driver releases . <p> Well , by switching to DirectX 10 and DirectX 10.1 , and disabling the settings they lose in DirectX 11 mode , we aimed to find out . <p> Unsurprisingly , benchmarks revealed superior performance when using DirectX 11 , and with that faster performance we breathlessly enabled additional , image quality-enhancing settings that are unavailable on the older APIs . <h> Distance Scaling <p> Distance Scaling is Grand Theft Auto V 's Level of Detail option , altering the amount of detail that is rendered at any one time , and adjusting the quality of distant detail when it is initially shown . Higher Scaling factors increase the quality of buildings and terrain , the number of objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fidelity of all game elements as the player 's distance from them changes . <p> To maintain the game 's impressive view distance , large buildings , mountains , and other highly visible features are always rendered , albeit at various levels of detail depending on the player 's position in the world . At close range though , Distance Scaling will adjust their fidelity , and add extra detail to buildings . <p> The most visible impact of Distance Scaling during gameplay is its influence on pop-in , reducing the likelihood of game elements jarringly popping into view , reducing immersion . You can easily experience this by turning down the setting and driving through a city street at speed , or by running the benchmark . Let your tolerance for this inform your choice of detail level when customising your settings . <p> Performance : Distance Scaling 's performance impact can change drastically from location to location , and is influenced greatly by the detail level chosen for every other game setting . For instance , if your Population Density is at minimum , Distance Scaling will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilians to render . But if your Grass Quality is turned up and you 're in a forest , performance will flat line . <p> From our test location , which featured a mix of game elements , and had fairly stable frame rates across multiple benchmark runs , the performance impact of Distance Scaling was moderate , but as stated you can expect its impact to wildly increase and decrease depending on your location , game settings , and gameplay scenario . <p> Given the extreme levels of pop-in that can occur on lower detail levels , Distance Scaling is one of the more important settings , and as such is worth prioritising over other effects . Just be prepared to tune its use as you enter new environments and adjust other settings . <h> Extended Distance Scaling <p> As the name suggests , Extended Distance Scaling is an upgrade to Distance Scaling , rendering extra detail in Distance Scaling 's sphere of influence , and extra detail at long range beyond said sphere . This is particularly evident in our first set of comparisons , where every single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail is rendered on the hill beneath the Vinewood sign . <p> Performance : Rendering every single game element at a significantly higher detail level has an unsurprisingly large impact on performance . And as before , the impact of Extended Distance Scaling varies between locations , and with the detail levels of your other settings . <p> Of all settings , Extended Distance Scaling has the largest performance impact when you factor in the added simultaneous hit from civilians , heavy traffic , police chases , explosions , and grass , which is impossible to accurately portray in benchmarks . It is strongly recommended , therefore , that you only use this setting on the most powerful of machines as it will crush your performance . <h> Extended Shadow Distance <p> In addition to increasing the range at which shadows are rendered , Extended Shadow Distance increases the detail level of shadows , adds additional shadows at all distances , and increases the accuracy of shadows , converting a guestimated blurry shadow into an accurately rendered , detailed shadow that is correctly displayed . <p> Performance : Even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance impact at any resolution , and in any scene , despite its placement in the Advanced Graphics menu . <p> Extended Shadow Distance is n't a must-have setting , but if you 've got spare performance it 's worth enabling to add shadows under cars and select objects at medium to long-range distances , and to increase the accuracy of all shadows . <h> Grass Quality <p> In the initial stages of Grand Theft Auto V , Grass Quality has a seemingly insignificant impact on performance , but once you hit the forests and other rural areas you 'll soon learn differently . There , Grass Quality reduces performance considerably , even on the most powerful systems . <p> On Ultra , vast areas are filled with flowers , grass and bushes , all rendered at a high level of detail , and with shadows that are potentially High Resolution and of a Very High quality , depending on your other settings . On Very High , distant foliage is pared back and shadows culled from what remains , and at mid and close ranges some additional shadows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the added pop-in and draw-in on grass as you travel throughout the world , something that only gets worse as the detail level decreases . Continuing , High sees the vast majority of shadows removed , while on Normal almost all foliage gets the chop . <p> Performance : Grass Quality has the largest impact on performance of any setting in the entire game , even with shadow quality settings at their lowest values . <p> Only the fastest of systems can cope with Grass Quality Ultra , and only recent systems will comfortably manage Very High . For everyone else , High should be the target given the significant loss of fidelity on Normal , where almost all foliage is removed . <h> High Detail Streaming While Flying <p> High Detail Streaming While Flying acts as a Level of Detail setting when you 're up in the air , reducing visual fidelity to improve performance . This also increases pop-in , but it 's worth noting that even with every game setting at max , pop in while flying is unavoidable . Although with the setting disabled , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Grand Theft Auto V settings , the impact of High Detail Streaming While Flying varies with your location , your other settings , and in this case with your altitude , too . <p> In the in-game benchmark , performance differs by a little over 4 frames per second . During gameplay in the city , however , the impact appears to be higher . If you 're a frequent flier you 'll likely want this setting enabled , but if that 's not your cup of tea you can safely disable it for some extra performance in those odd occasions you do take to the skies . <h> High Resolution Shadows <p> The self-explanatory name says it all : High Resolution Shadows increase the detail level of shadows . However , this is typically noticeable only when using ' Sharp ' Soft Shadows , instead of NVIDIA PCSS or one of the other soft options . The example below also demonstrates how the detail of shadows changes depending on the distance from the shadow caster , the distance from the player 's point of view , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Advanced shadow setting ensures maximum shadow fidelity , but with its relatively large performance impact players on lower-end systems benefit more from enabling ' Soft ' Soft Shadows , instead of ' Sharp ' High Resolution Shadows . This will mask not only the loss of shadow fidelity , but also the increase in shadow aliasing when High Resolution Shadows are disabled . <h> Ignore Suggested Limits <p> By default , Ignore Suggested Limits prevents players from enabling settings that exceed the Video RAM ( VRAM ) limits of their GPUs . By turning the setting ' On ' , you can enable any combination of settings . Note however , if you exceed your VRAM capacity you may encounter stuttering , game pauses ( while data is swapped in and out of VRAM ) , and crashing . For most users it is therefore recommended that the setting remain ' Off ' . <h> In-Game Depth of Field Effects <p> If you like backgrounds and other game elements to be stylishly blurred when getting into vehicles , rounding corners , or aiming down your gun sights , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Available when PostFX is set to Very High or Ultra , Depth of Field is a personal preference setting , just like Motion Blur . Objectively , it helps frame cutscenes and focus the camera on a specific event or location , but on occasion it can incorrectly blur the entire screen during gameplay , before jarringly snapping back to a sharp image . <p> Performance : If you like Depth of Field you 'll be losing 1.6 frames per second at most during gameplay , and a few more frames per second during cut scenes , but as those are non-interactive the loss of performance typically is n't felt . <p> To increase Depth of Field performance slightly , without harming its image quality , lower PostFX to Very High . For details on its functionality , keep on reading . <h> Long Shadows <p> The Long Shadows option renders more accurate shadows during the game 's dusk and dawn time periods ( manually accessible via Director Mode ) . The effect is so subtle though that few will accurately identify the effect 's use in a side-by-side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect , one can safely disable Long Shadows and recoup the three frames per second . <h> Particles Quality <p> Evaluating Particles Quality is one of the trickier tasks in this guide - the look of explosions are randomised , physics and weather systems cause additional variation , and the after-effects alter too . What we can definitively say is that as the setting is raised explosions and other effects gain increased volume and detail , and when set to High or Very High , particle shadows are rendered , too . <p> It 's far from a perfect example , but out of all the screenshots and videos we captured the above comparisons are as close as we 've come to showing the impact of Particles Quality . When looking at the images , focus on the white truck on the left , which is consumed in a more detailed fireball and explosion at higher detail levels . <p> Performance : The benchmark was the most accurate measurement of particle performance at hand , even with its variance , and so is used here in our chart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly higher detail level , and with a few more particles when dialling up Particles Quality . In larger fire fights , and a series of staged explosions , the quantity of extra particles can add up , but never did we observe a huge reduction in performance . At most , perhaps expect a 6-10 FPS reduction in the most intensive scenarios . <h> Population Density <p> If you like Los Santos ' streets to be busy , and its sidewalks populated with civilians , Population Density is the go-to setting . Like Particles Quality though , it 's a tricky one to test due to the amount of randomisation , and the fact that changes to the setting do n't occur until you run or drive sufficiently far from your present location . Given these factors , the in-game benchmark was once again the most reliable tool for measuring the setting 's performance and image quality impact . <p> As you 'd expect , the number of civilians dotted around the scene decreases with the detail level of the setting ( several of 50% 's civilians are further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene has far too much variance , with the number visible changing greatly between repeated max setting runs . On 0% , we did note a solitary vehicle at extreme distances , which made us evaluate the placement of vehicles in other scenes , too . Turns out , vehicles are n't always constrained to the immediate vicinity as you might expect , instead spawning at your maximum Distance Scaling and Extended Distance Scaling view distances on occasion . Civilians , in comparison , are almost always constrained to short and medium range . <p> This second round of comparisons more accurately demonstrates the setting 's impact on vehicle density . Those with an eagle eye may note the vehicles past the bend on the next section of highway at every detail level . As nothing more than blobs they cost a fraction of a frame per second to render , and help the world appear more populated ( note , the maximum visible distance of these blobs can be affected by the two Distance Scaling settings ) . As you approach a distance at which they need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on your Density settings , a process that can be jarring when flying . On the road , you typically wo n't notice , making it a clever trick for increasing fidelity . This is especially beneficial at night , with dozens of extra simulated vehicles driving around with their lights on , creating the impression of a bustling city . <p> Performance : Accurately measuring Population Density 's performance impact is equally tricky thanks to the game 's random elements . In the canned benchmark we see a spread of only a few frames per second , but in various gameplay tests that figure typically doubles , and sometimes triples . <p> From these tests , we recommend 75% Population Density as the ' sweet spot ' . Roads and sidewalks feel suitably busy , and a few frames per second are saved for other effects . Note , however , that the performance impact of Reflection , Shadow and Post FX settings will be amplified when increasing Population Density , as there 'll be more reflections rendered , more civilians and vehicles to shadow , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find therefore that you need to dial back their detail levels when cranking up Population Density if performance dips a smidge too far . <h> Population Variety <p> Population Variety is unique in that has no effect on performance , but can affect visual fidelity quite considerably . The simplest explanation of its function is this : if there are 100 vehicles in the game files , and 50 civilians , 50% Population Variety will load 50 vehicles and 25 civilians into your video card 's memory ( VRAM ) , and randomly place them in the world . With 100% Population Density this would result in multiple copies of each vehicle and civilian appearing in each scene , reducing immersion once you notice the numerous clones . By increasing Population Variety you reduce the chance of this occurring , and see a greater variety of vehicles on the roads . <p> Per general game design rules , each civilian and vehicle is built with a strict polygon count , ensuring the performance cost of rendering five different civilians or vehicles is the same as rendering one five times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain amount of VRAM , and by raising Population Variety you 're allowing Grand Theft Auto V to load more unique models and textures into memory . <p> Variety is therefore dictated by your GPU 's VRAM , and performance is dictated by the Population Density you specified earlier . For players with 2GB of VRAM , it 's likely that compromises between the various memory-consuming settings will have to be made , and in our opinion Population Variety is one of the settings that should be sacrificed for superior textures and shadows . <h> Post FX <p> Bloom lighting , motion blur ( optional ) , glare , lens flare , persistent background depth of field , and high dynamic range ( HDR ) lighting are the main features of the Post FX setting , though on occasion you 'll also see crepuscular rays ( God Rays ) , heat haze , and a few other volumetric effects . Note , Ultra or Very High is required for In-Game Depth of Field Effects , and Motion Blur . <p> Lowering Post FX to Very High reduces the quality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and under closer examination the accuracy of some other effects can be seen to decrease ever so slightly , too . On High , further reductions in quality occur , and some glare and lens flare effects are disabled . Finally , on Normal , the quality of remaining effects is further reduced , and bloom is disabled entirely . <p> Performance : Curiously , some players report sizeable performance gains by lowering Post FX from Ultra to Very High , gaining them up to 10 frames per second . This is contrary to our own testing , even in the same locations tested by these players , and with the same graphics cards and settings . We 're at a loss as to why this occurs , so it 's recommended you test the setting locally to determine its impact on your machine . <p> In our testing , the largest delta in performance between Ultra and Normal was measured at dusk in a foggy urban environment filled with street lights and vehicles , creating the perfect combination of intensive Post FX effects . At other times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , performance typically improved by 3-5 frames per second when switching to Normal from Ultra . <p> Given the loss of fidelity on Normal , and the relatively minor performance impact of this setting ( in our testing ) , we 'd recommend Very High for players looking to improve performance but retain a decent level of image quality . <h> Reflection Quality <p> As it says on the tin , Reflection Quality adjusts the clarity of the reflections found on vehicles , shiny floors , windows , puddles , and open bodies of water . <p> Whip out your microscope and you may ascertain the difference between Ultra and Very High in this example . Clearer is the difference between Very High and High , which sees the accuracy of reflections further reduced . On Normal , reflections lose almost all detail , and reflections on other surfaces are completely removed , something you 'll notice immediately in our second set of comparisons . <p> Out in the open world , the differences between the Reflection Quality detail levels are more visible : Ultra to Very High results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further reduces clarity , and High to Normal sees reflections removed from every vehicle , window , and building . Furthermore , the few remaining reflections found on bodies of water and reflective floors suffer from artifacting , flickering repeatedly . <p> Performance : Like many other settings , the performance impact of Reflections can vary greatly . More vehicles , windows , water , and buildings add additional reflections , and higher Distance Scaling settings add more detail to be reflected . For our benchmark , we went with a wet downtown run that features plenty of traffic , and the skyscrapers you can see above . <p> Given the performance impact of Very High and Ultra Reflections in intensive scenarios , and the massive hit to image quality on Normal , players should be aiming for High at the very minimum , perhaps at the cost of other settings even . <h> Reflection MSAA <p> Reflection Multisample Anti-Aliasing reduces reflection aliasing , but as the world is constantly in motion , and you 're typically on the go too , it 's unlikely you 'll ever notice its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting changes , as well unexpected changes to the density of grass and other foliage , the shadowing of said foliage , the fidelity and realism of the water 's surface , the texturing of fine detail , and the level of anisotropic filtering . <p> This scene offers a closer look at the texture and Anisotropic Filtering ( AF ) issues that occur on Normal , which may explain why some players are reporting issues with ineffectual AF , regardless of their AF setting . <p> Finally , an example demonstrating the loss of Parallax Occlusion Mapping ( POM ) on Normal , impacting the bumpy appearance of most game surfaces . <p> Performance : Between Very High and High the adjustments to Shader Quality have a minimal impact on overall fidelity , but on Normal almost all scenes are badly affected , in particular those in the city where Anisotropic Filtering no longer functions correctly . For most players then , High is the target . <h> Shadow Quality <p> Shadow Quality works hand in hand with High Resolution Shadows to improve the definition and accuracy of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve level of detail . And like our earlier High Resolution Shadows comparison , the benefits of Shadow Quality are best demonstrated with ' Sharp ' Soft Shadows . <p> In addition to the obvious increase in shadow fidelity , note the accuracy of the shadows on the houses . As Shadow Quality is reduced , the general accuracy of shadowing decreases , resulting in the eventual loss of shadows under the overhangs of rooftops . Similarly , the detail and accuracy of shadows under , on , and around other surfaces is greatly decreased . <p> Furthermore , the use of High results in the loss of vehicle and NPC shadows cast by vehicle headlights , and on Normal shadows cast by foliage and other objects are also lost , significantly impacting image quality . <p> Performance : Shadow Quality can have a moderate performance impact , and its higher detail levels can consume copious amounts of VRAM , but given the improvement to fidelity game-wide it 's more than worth it . <p> If you 're using a Soft Shadow setting other than ' Sharp ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the softness obfuscates shadow aliasing and the reduction of shadow detail . <h> Tessellation <p> Tessellation in general adds extra geometric detail to surfaces , objects , and characters . In Max Payne 3 , the last Rockstar RAGE Engine game to be released on PC , tessellation was used subtlety to add curvature to Max 's ear and clothes , and to the tires of vehicles . In Grand Theft Auto V , its use is equally subtle , adding detail to select trees , the occasional bush , some cables , and some bodies of water . <p> Of these enhancements only tree tessellation is noticeable during gameplay , and is likewise the only feature visible enough to capture in screenshots . <p> As the detail level is raised , the amount of tessellation added at each step decreases , to the point where Very High 's improvement is nigh on impossible to spot ( it 's around the base and middle of the right-most tree in the foreground , and near the base of the tree in front of the basketball court , if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary depending on your location and the number of visible tessellated game elements , but in general the performance cost of this subtle feature is rarely felt . <p> High is mostly identical to Very High at ground level , though on occasion Very High 's textures will be sharper when viewed in first person ; further from the floor some larger and less important textures are of a lower quality to slightly reduce VRAM usage . On the whole though the difference is n't pronounced . On Normal , however , everything takes a sizeable hit , decreasing the fidelity of every textured game element , which includes the textures applied to water surfaces . <p> As you can see for yourself , Very High and High are nearly identical , with only a minor reduction in the detail level of water ripples becoming apparent after prolonged in-game observation . On Normal , almost all detail is lost , the accuracy of translucency and simulated caustics is decreased , and the reflective capabilities of the water 's surface are reduced . <p> Performance : Minimal gains are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pool in Grand Theft Auto V , so we 'd recommend leaving Water Quality on High at the very least , on any system . <h> Game Setting VRAM Usage <p> You 've seen how the many settings shake out , and now you 're possibly angling for a specific combination . But do you have enough Video Memory ( VRAM ) ? You can use the in-game counter to find out , but that does n't show you the cost per setting , merely the total . For that reason we 've built our biggest chart yet , listing the VRAM usage of individual settings at 1920x1080 , starting at a minimum-setting baseline of 1066 MB . Note , Ambient : Occlusion High , Soft Shadows : Soft , Soft Shadows : Softer , and Soft Shadows : Softest used 1MB of VRAM each , but were removed from the chart . Settings with zero cost were similarly removed . <p> Click to enlarge <p> Looking at the chart , you can see that you 'll require an extra 1335 MB of VRAM to enable Grand Theft Auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crank MSAA up to 8x . All in all , you need a 4GB GPU to switch every single doodad on at 1920x1080 , and a TITAN X to do the same at higher resolutions . <h> Grand Theft Auto V Tweaking <p> Modders are presently diving into Grand Theft Auto V 's game files and will likely discover a variety of tweaks and enhancements , just as they did for Grand Theft Auto IV . While we wait for the fruits of their labor , there are a few tips , tricks and tools to bolster image quality and performance in Rockstar 's latest open-world action game . <h> NVIDIA Control Dynamic Super Resolution <p> To amp up your graphics even further , activate Dynamic Super Resolution ( DSR ) to receive up to 4K-quality graphics on your HD monitor . How it works is simple : compatible games , such as Grand Theft Auto V , are rendered at a higher , more detailed resolution , and the image intelligently shrunk back down to the resolution of your monitor using a custom-made filter , giving you up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains more , and the images show how to activate the setting in the NVIDIA Control Panel . <p> With DSR enabled , textures are sharper , aliasing is greatly reduced , objects have better definition , vegetation is more detailed , and distant game detail is significantly clearer . If you 've used DSR in other games you 'll know of these benefits already , but if you have n't had the chance here 's a look at how Grand Theft Auto V 's graphics scale with rendering resolutions . <p> If you have the performance , increasing the resolution to 2560x1440 delivers an impressive range of improvements that affect nearly every game element and scene in Grand Theft Auto V. Beyond 2560x1440 , Grand Theft Auto V continues to scale nicely , adding detail and improving the quality and accuracy of effects . <p> If you can , we definitely recommend a step up to 2560x1440 DSR ; if performance becomes an issue , switch to FXAA anti-aliasing as the downsampling from DSR will counteract FXAA 's blur and take care of remaining aliasing . <h> NVIDIA Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textures and those viewed on an angle , forcibly enable High Quality Anisotropic Filtering ( AF ) via the NVIDIA Control Panel , like so : <p> On max settings there 's a subtle improvement but an improvement nonetheless , and for those using Shader Quality Normal , a night and day difference in some cases . <p> Ca n't spot the difference ? Focus on the faded lines on the left of the course , and on the grass on the bottom left of the image . <p> To activate MFAA , choose the following settings in the NVIDIA Control Panel : <p> Please note , MFAA is only compatible with single-GPU systems at the time of writing . <h> NVIDIA 3D Vision <p> If you 'd like to experience Grand Theft Auto V in a new dimension , before an enterprising modder knocks together unofficial VR support , you can play the game in 3D Vision , enabling you to experience Los Santos and Blaine County in immersive stereoscopic 3D when using a 3D Vision monitor and a set of 3D Vision glasses . Of note , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've already upgraded to G-SYNC you 'll only need a 3D Vision Kit to begin your new-dimension exploration of Grand Theft Auto V. <p> Once you 've got the necessary gear for 3D , this is how Grand Theft Auto V looks in the third dimension : <h> Overclocking <p> If you need extra performance , overclocking your GPU and CPU will pay dividends in the demanding open world of Grand Theft Auto V. Learn how with the help of GeForce Garage . <h> Command Line Tweaks <p> In C : Program Files ( x86 ) **25;372;TOOLONG Theft Auto V , create the file commandline.txt , and add any of the following commands , with a space between each , to modify Grand Theft Auto V when it next loads . <p> -benchmark : Automatically loads the in-game benchmark instead of single or multiplayer game modes <p> -benchmarkFrameTimes : Output frame times from the benchmark to help identify stuttering <p> -benchmarkIterations x : Specifies the number of benchmark runs <p> -benchmarkPass x : Limits the benchmark to one of the four scenes <p> -benchmarknoaudio : Disables audio in the benchmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Loads the game directly into a multiplayer match <p> **25;399;TOOLONG : Prevents the game from resetting graphics options when swapping GPUs <p> -frameLimit xx : Cap your framerate to a specific value <p> -GPUCount : Specify the number of GPUs that should be utilised <p> -pedLodBias 0.0-1.0f : Overrides the Population Density setting , enabling you to manually specify the number of civilians .

In addition to optimising over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update drivers and profiles , record and stream gameplay with ShadowPlay , and wirelessly stream PC games , including Grand Theft Auto V , to NVIDIA SHIELD devices . <p> Taking into account your GPU and CPU , as well as many additional factors , GeForce Experience 's game recommendations can be applied with a single click , and are updated over time should developer patches and NVIDIA drivers improve performance further still . This one-click solution is perfect for gamers who wish to play instead of fiddling , and for those with little experience in configuring settings for an optimal experience . <p> Ordinarily we 'd offer manual configuration recommendations , too , but in the case of Grand Theft Auto V we 've found that folks rarely agree on their favourite options , and that there 's a migraine-inducing number of settings configurations that affect performance and VRAM usage . Instead , we recommend you begin with GeForce Experience 's suggestions and modify them based on the information in this guide . For instance , if you prefer civilian and vehicle variety to shadow quality , make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not exceeding usage , and see how things play out in action scenes . <p> To turn everything on at 1920x1080 , and 4x TXAA , you 'll need a GPU with at least 4GB of VRAM , and to hit a solid 60 frames-plus per second in every single intensive moment , a top end supercomputer will be required . With a few tweaks though you can dramatically improve performance with a near-imperceptible loss in visual fidelity , giving you a smooth , highly detailed experience on a far more affordable system . <h> Grand Theft Auto V PC : Worth The Wait <p> Almost always , multi-platform games look and play best on PC , and we rightfully label them the " definitive edition " . In the case of Grand Theft Auto V , that simply does n't do the PC version justice , which has been a labour of love for Rockstar 's studios . Graphics options are extensive and customisable , control and view options are in abundance , and entirely new features like Director Mode and the Rockstar Editor have been implemented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , and what 's here puts the feature sets and options of many PC exclusives to shame . <p> Unquestionably then , Grand Theft Auto V PC represents Rockstar 's true vision , simulating a living , breathing world full of detail , with enormous draw distances , cinematic effects that enhance the engrossing story , and features that enable fans to create and share their own stories . And with its highly scalable engine and graphics options , Grand Theft Auto V PC can be enjoyed by almost anyone , and typically at a higher resolution and framerate than was possible on other platforms . <p> If you 've yet to get Grand Theft Auto V PC , do so now from Steam and other authorised sellers ; by the time you 've had your fill of single-player , multiplayer , and heists , there 'll undoubtedly be a budding mod scene ready to drag you back into Los Santos . 
@@20827385 @827385/ <h> TXAA - Temporal Anti-Aliasing - Technology <h> Technology <h> NVIDIA- TXAA <p> TXAA is a new film " style anti " aliasing technique designed specifically to reduce temporal aliasing ( crawling and flickering in motion ) . This technology is a mix of a temporal filter , hardware anti " aliasing , and custom CG film " style anti " aliasing resolve . To filter any given pixel on the screen , TXAA uses a contribution of samples , both inside and outside of the pixel , in conjunction with samples from prior frames , to offer the highest quality filtering possible . TXAA has improved spatial filtering over standard 2xMSAA and 4xMSAA . For example , on fences or foliage and in motion , TXAA starts to approach and sometimes exceeds the quality of other high " end professional anti " aliasing algorithms . The higher " quality filtering used by TXAA results in softer images compared to the lower " quality filtering of traditional MSAA . <p> TXAA combines the raw power of MSAA with sophisticated resolve filters similar to those employed in CG films to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique . Depending on the type of shading implemented in a given game , the performance hit of TXAA can be slightly different . In contrast to methods like FXAA that attempt to maximize performance at the expense of quality , TXAA attempts to maximize quality at the expense of performance . TXAA is a superior option for those looking for the highest " quality anti " aliasing with the most efficient performance possible to make games such as Assassin 's Creed- III and Call of Duty- : Black Ops 2 look their absolute best . <p> NOTE : TXAA is only supported on NVIDIA- KeplerG GPUs and will require a GTX 600 " series graphics card to enable the feature in the graphics options . If you do not have the requirements to enable TXAA , the option will be hidden . TXAA is not properly observed with static screen shots , only with scenes in motion . 
@@20827393 @827393/ <h> The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt Graphics , Performance &amp; Tweaking Guide <p> Andrzej Sapkowski 's short stories and novels about a white-haired monster hunter proved popular in his native Poland in the 1990s , quickly becoming one of the best-selling fantasy franchises . In 2007 they formed the basis of The Witcher , an action role-playing game built by a previously-unknown studio that specialised in localisation . Featuring spectacular graphics , a large game world , an engrossing story , and lots of satisfying action , the little-hyped title catapulted Polish company CD Projekt into the limelight , resulting in the creation of CD Projekt RED , now one of the world 's leading game developers . <p> Reviews are glowing , but we 're here to talk graphics , not gameplay . So join us as we dive into CD Projekt RED 's 100-hour action RPG to dissect its graphics settings and examine their performance impact , and to discover the numerous tweaks that bolster the game 's much-discussed graphics . <p> Creating game engines is an expensive business , and in the past few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions like CryEngine and Unreal Engine that are constantly upgraded and backed by dedicated support staff . Given the number of models , textures , audio files , and other assets in The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt , you might expect CD Projekt RED to follow this trend to cut costs and ease the development of a gigantic open world game . But no , CD Projekt RED has opted to instead upgrade The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition 's REDengine 2 , which was itself an upgrade of The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings 's REDengine 1 . <p> The biggest challenge in this upgrade process was the implementation of a streaming load system , enabling the developers to switch from smaller environments with frequent loading screens , to big open worlds that load silently in the background during gameplay . This is no easy feat , and has taken established engines some time to fully implement and perfect , but here in The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt CD Projekt RED has created a fully functioning , near-flawless system on their first attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been upgraded for meet modern-day standards , ensuring the appearance of detailed environments ( in the context of an open world game ) . Physically-based rendering , high-precision effects and DirectX 11 tessellation are all to be found within the updated engine , along with other expected mod cons . <p> A Quick Word About Screenshots <p> A key feature of a graphics guide is the ability to demonstrate the impact modified settings have on visual fidelity . To do this effectively , movement and variance in a scene has to be avoided . In The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt , we 've had to create save games in a debug . exe with time frozen , before opening them in the proper . exe to capture screenshots . On occasion this causes clouds to disappear or render incorrectly , objects to float , grass to clip through walls , and characters to spawn with outstretched arms . Needless to say , this reduces image quality and immersion , and can make NPCs look goofy , but this is the only way to create effective comparisons . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these quirks do not occur during normal gameplay , and should therefore be of no concern . <p> The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt PC-Exclusive Graphics Enhancements <p> Like every multi-platform game , The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt looks , runs and plays best on PC . Texture clarity , view distance , and all the usual suspects are improved , and to further bolster graphical fidelity we 've worked closely with CD Projekt RED to introduce NVIDIA HairWorks and NVIDIA HBAO+ to their much-anticipated action RPG . Furthermore , you can utilise NVIDIA Dynamic Super Resolution ( DSR ) to crank up the rendering resolution , NVIDIA G-SYNC monitors to eliminate screen tearing and stuttering , and NVIDIA GameStream to stream the game itself to SHIELD devices and your TV . <p> NVIDIA HairWorks <p> Commonly , fur and hair in games is created by adding polygon strips and transparent textures to a character , and though this is a simple and cheap implementation the result appears completely static and visually uninteresting . With additional layers and some basic animation , quality and realism can be improved greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The solution ? NVIDIA HairWorks , which adds tens of thousands of DirectX 11 , tessellated hair strands to characters , each reacting realistically to movement and external forces . In addition , the use of individual hairs and layers enables dynamic lighting to permeate throughout each strand and layer , for hairs to be accurately shadowed , and for deeper layers to be self-shadowed by other hairs , improving image quality further still . <p> For the The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt we 've worked closely with CD Projekt RED throughout the game 's development , adding HairWorks to Geralt 's hair styles and beards , to the mane of Roach , his trusty steed , to the manes of other horses , and to over three dozen monsters . Out in the open world , this significant undertaking results in the addition of HairWorks to the majority of Geralt 's animal and supernatural assailants , creating immersive scenes and encounters for the duration of the 100-hour action RPG . <p> NVIDIA HairWorks enabled ( click to enlarge ) <p> NVIDIA HairWorks disabled ( click to enlarge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and beard , which grows as the game progresses , we developed new , more advanced stiffness and bending controls to allow for intricate styling . And for realistic shading in a world with dynamic weather and numerous locations , we introduced new diffuse , specular , and glint controls , enabling Geralt 's white hair to match surrounding conditions . <p> Another new addition is the ability for Geralt 's hair to get visibly wet , matching the shading properties applied to his wardrobe when taking a quick dip . Over time he 'll dry out , and the appearance of hair will return to its normal state . <p> On average , 10,000 to 40,000 strands of tessellated hair are applied to HairWorks-enhanced models at combat view distances , with up to 60,00 applied to the game 's furriest creatures . Up close , when creatures are futilely trying to end Geralt 's life , hair counts are cranked up to ensure maximum fidelity , bringing the 40,000 average up to 125,000 in some cases . As they then flee for their lives , hair counts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the distance . On Geralt , hair counts average at 30,000 , and scale up to 115,000 , with around 6,000 hairs just for his beard . <p> Click to load an interactive comparison <p> In previous HairWorks-enhanced games , hair aliasing was sometimes visible when players used post-process anti-aliasing or low levels of hardware anti-aliasing . Now , we apply Multisample Anti-Aliasing ( MSAA ) by default directly to HairWorks hairs , ensuring high-quality , aliasing-free hair regardless of the player 's general anti-aliasing settings . This new feature debuts in The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt and will be available to other GameWorks users in the near future via a free update on NVIDIA 's Dev Zone . <p> Click here for an enlargement that better demonstrates the benefits of HairWorks MSAA <p> With wind , water , and spell interaction , in addition to accurate shading , shadowing and animation , and the application of MSAA , The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt 's NVIDIA HairWorks integration delivers the most realistic and immersive hair and fur seen to date in a playable game , significantly bolstering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interactive comparison <p> Performance : Three HairWorks options are on offer in The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt : " Off " , " Geralt Only " , and " All " . As the self-explanatory names suggest , they control whether HairWorks is switched off , applied only to Geralt , or applied to Geralt , his horse , and all other HairWorks-enhanced characters , creatures and monsters in the game . <p> Given the numerous scenarios and action sequences that can occur , and the varying number of HairWorks-enhanced actors in each , we 've tested three scenarios to better demonstrate the performance cost of HairWorks . Note , patch 1.03 improved HairWorks rendering performance , adding a few extra frames per second in each of our tests . <p> In action sequences filled with HairWorks-enhanced actors , performance can decrease by a good fifteen to twenty frames per second . For many that will be a bit too expensive ; for those who can enable HairWorks , said sequences will be more dynamic and realistic , with hair reacting to movement , attacks , and spells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wide side-view of Geralt and his horse , HairWorks can cost a little over 10 frames per second . Given the time you spend staring at Geralt , and riding Roach , it 's worth investing some frames for significantly improved image quality . <p> Thanks to the dynamic level of detail system , we can crank up the hair count in close-ups , enhancing Geralt with up to 115,000 DirectX 11 tessellated hairs . And while it may cost 13 frames per second to do this , it does n't half look good . <p> Do note , Maxwell GPUs are up to three times faster at tessellation than previous-generation GPUs , so you may experience lower HairWorks performance on other graphics cards due to the extensive use of tessellated hairs . <p> NVIDIA HBAO+ Ambient Occlusion <p> Ambient Occlusion ( AO ) adds contact shadows where two surfaces or objects meet , and where an object blocks light from reaching another nearby game element . The AO technique used and the quality of the implementation affects the accuracy of shadows , and whether new shadows are formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occlusion , scenes look flat and unrealistic , and objects appear as if they are floating . <p> In The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt , players have the choice of Screen Space Ambient Occlusion ( SSAO ) , and NVIDIA HBAO+ . Unusually , SSAO has been modified to compute AO at 1/2 resolution , 1/4 resolution , and 1/8 resolution before combining the three together and upsampling the result to full resolution . <p> In comparison , HBAO+ is rendered at full resolution from the off , is a newer technique with a variety of enhancements , detailed here , and performs better , relatively speaking . As demonstrated in the interactive comparisons below , and the performance chart later , these enhancements enable HBAO+ to produce superior AO shadows that realistically shadow game elements , that avoid over-darkening fine detail , and are free from the unrealistic halos that are occasionally visible around objects and characters . <p> Performance : Given the significant increase in image quality , one would ordinarily expect an equally significant reduction in performance , but because of its efficient DirectX 11 programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames slower per second than SSAO . <p> Additional Graphics Settings <p> Anti-Aliasing <p> To tackle jagged edges , CD Projekt RED has developed their own post-process anti-aliasing solution , as hardware anti-aliasing techniques such as MSAA and TXAA are incompatible with REDengine 3 's renderer . This unnamed post-processing technique operates with a level of fidelity similar to FXAA , but with an added temporal anti-aliasing component to reduce the crawling and shimmering of anti-aliased edges when the camera or player 's viewpoint is in motion . <p> Injectable SMAA may be an alternative anti-aliasing technique for those seeking a lower-cost solution , though we failed to make it work in our development build . What did work was NVIDIA Control Panel FXAA , with in-game Sharpening enabled to counter added post-processing blur . Better yet , downsample from a higher resolution with NVIDIA Dynamic Super Resolution ( DSR ) , and add FXAA or SMAA ( if you can make it work ) if your DSR resolution is n't particularly high . <p> Unfortunately though , none of these alternative solutions can re-introduce temporal anti-aliasing , which helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutions . <p> Bloom <p> Bloom intensifies and improves the appearance of bright lights , and the appearance of bight light cast on a surface . Without Bloom , lighting can appear flat , and special effects dull . <p> Performance : Bloom is a post-processing technique and has a minor impact on performance , like the majority of the other post-process settings on offer . <p> Given the loss of fidelity seen in our comparison , Bloom 's not something you 'd wish to disable . <p> Blur &amp; Motion Blur <p> If you want to accentuate the speed of an attack or creature , or distort the screen when casting a spell , Blur &amp; Motion Blur are your go-to settings . With " Blur " , radial and Gaussian blur is introduced , and with " Motion Blur " we see the introduction of general velocity-based blurring . <p> The precise performance impact of the two settings is tricky to ascertain , but it would appear that together the two settings cost a few frames per second in a fight . <p> Chromatic Aberration <p> Chromatic Aberration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improperly taken photos . In recent years however , Chromatic Aberration has grown popular with game developers , much to the dismay of gamers who prefer cleaner images free of unsightly distortion . In the context of a photographer , or a security guard viewing the game world through a cheap camera , its use might make sense , but when playing in first or third person it merely suggests a trip to the optician is in order . <p> Thankfully , CD Projekt RED has made Chromatic Aberration an optional effect in The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt , ensuring a clean , clear image is obtainable . When enabled , it distorts the picture slightly , but no where near the extent seen in other games featuring the effect . This does n't really come through on screenshots , however . <p> Performance : Like other post-process effects , Chromatic Aberration has a minute impact on performance , so low in fact that it 's nearly invisible on our chart ( 0.3 frames per second average across multiple tests ) . <p> Depth of Field <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can help mask aliasing and lower-detail game elements seen on the horizon when using relatively low resolutions like 1920x1080 ( the quality of distant detail increases greatly with the resolution , as in just about every other game ) . <p> Performance : Out in the open world , Depth of Field costs less than two frames per second , but on occasion its cost can increase if large swathes of close detail are blurred for stylistic effect during a cut scene . <p> Detail Level <p> With a name like " Detail Level " you 'd expect this setting to adjust Level of Detail scaling , the amount of geometry that 's visible at any one time , or something else along those lines . Instead , it acts similarly to The Witcher 2 's ' Decals ' setting , adjusting the visibility of blood spatter and other decals that are typically generated during combat . <p> In The Witcher 3 , rather than disabling Decals , the setting merely changes the distance from which they can be seen . <p> Decals have an unnoticeable performance impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet anyway due to the prevalence of foliage in almost all environments . As such , you can safely turn down this setting if you require a frame or two extra in the largest of battles . <p> In the tweaking section we reveal how you can increase the visibility of the decals , the number of decals rendered simultaneously , and the visibility of other Detail Level settings that can not be changed in-game . <p> Foliage Visibility Range <p> The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt utilises the award-winning SpeedTree middleware to create detailed , varied forests , expansive fields of grass , and thick bushes throughout the game 's world . Each piece of foliage sways realistically in accordance with the dynamic weather system , and is accurately lit , shaded , and shadowed . <p> When raising the Foliage Visibility setting , the maximum number of trees rendered at any one time is doubled at each detail level , primarily affecting the appearance of distant views , and the detail level of these trees is increased . Similarly , the maximum rendering distance and quality of grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance of Foliage Shadows ( shadows cast by foliage ) . <p> Together , the various components of the Foliage Visibility setting have a considerable impact on visual fidelity , as demonstrated below in our interactive comparisons . <p> Performance : In the game 's starting zone Foliage Visibility has a moderate performance cost . Once you hit the wide open landmasses with hill-top views , however , its cost rockets , instantly making it the most expensive setting in the entire game ( with the exclusion of HairWorks in combat encounters ) . <p> For most players , Medium 's fidelity and rendering distances will be acceptable given the performance cost of High and Ultra , but if you can , push for High for fully-formed fields and foliage shadows at decent distances . <p> Players with top-end systems , meanwhile , will want to check out our tweaking section to learn how to further increase the visibility and quality of foliage . <p> Grass Density <p> As the name suggests , Grass Density adjusts the amount of grass you 'll see on the ground , but even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Performance : The minute amount of extra grass does n't justify the loss of a further few frames per second , in our opinion . Instead , better results would be achieved by raising the Foliage Visibility setting . <p> If you have the performance for Foliage Visibility and Grass Density you may wish to head on over to the tweaking section to discover how to boost grass density beyond in-game limits . <p> Light Shafts <p> Also known as God Rays and Crepuscular Rays , Light Shafts project beams of light through foliage , into dark rooms through windows ( see recent Game of Thrones episodes for some excellent real life examples ) , and into darker areas through gaps in the geometry , as highlighted in our interactive comparison below . <p> Performance : Light Shafts are post-process like many other settings , and have a similarly small impact on performance . <p> Light Shafts add nicely to image quality , atmosphere and immersion , and are a must-have setting for any system . <p> Number of Background Characters <p> According to the game 's config file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of NPCs simultaneously rendered to 75 , 100 , 130 , or 150 , depending on the detail level chosen . To date we have been unable to find any location that features even 75 characters , let alone 150 , so are unable to demonstrate the impact of this setting . <p> One has to assume a location where the setting is of use exists given its inclusion in the game . If you find it , please let us know in the Comments section . <p> PhysX <p> NVIDIA PhysX is not an adjustable setting in The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt , but its implementation bears mention , as it adds dynamic cloth and destruction effects throughout the game on all platforms . <p> On PC , where CPUs are capable of far more calculations per second , these effects are more realistic , contain additional particles , and persist for longer in the environment . <p> NVIDIA GameWorks Destruction <p> NVIDIA GameWorks Cloth <p> Shadow Quality <p> Hidden away within Shadow Quality 's gubbins you 'll find eleven options that modify the resolution of three shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detail distances , the number of Cascaded Shadow Maps used , the quality of these Cascaded Shadow Maps , and the maximum number of visible terrain shadow atlas ' , which increase the quality of terrain shadowing . <p> Performance : Shadow Quality 's performance cost is surprisingly slight given the many types of shadows and the number of shadows in the environment . <p> Digging deeper , aggressive level of detail options are revealed , which limit shadow rendering distances and shadow detail to maintain breezy levels of performance . Thankfully , these limits can be overridden , as explained in our tweaking section . <p> Sharpen <p> If you 've ever used Photoshop 's image resize tool , SweetFX 's image adjustments , or something similar , you 'll be familiar with options to sharpen the picture , making everything that bit crisper , if slightly less natural in some circumstances . Here , the Sharpen setting enables you to increase the crispness of the setting without the need for the extra tools . <p> Not shown in screenshots is the increased temporal aliasing from the addition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grass and other fine detail . <p> Performance : Sharpen 's another post-processing option with a negligible performance cost . In this case , half a frame per second at the very most . <p> Terrain Quality <p> Terrain Quality is intended to increase the geometric detail of terrain surfaces through the application of tessellation , but in our supposedly-final build the setting has zero impact in every one of the thirty-something locations tested . <p> Once it is working we 'll revisit this topic , as terrain tessellation is likely to have a noticeable impact on detail levels throughout the game . <p> Texture Quality <p> Like other open world games , The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt employs a background loading system , enabling you to travel freely across the game 's landmasses and oceans without encountering a single load screen . Unlike these other games , however , REDengine 3 manages to attain a high level of texture fidelity in these huge zones using as little as 2GB of VRAM , enabling users of previous-generation GPUs to enjoy max-quality texturing . <p> On Ultra , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in the memory budget , allowing more textures to be stored in memory at any given time . Running around on foot this makes little difference , but when galloping on horseback it minimizes the chance of encountering the unsightly streaming-in of high-quality textures . <p> Update : As of patch v1.04 , the above has changed with the introduction of a Mipmap Bias variable that increases the sharpness of many game details on High and Ultra . The pros and cons of this feature , its visual impact , and information on how to tweak it can be found in the tweaking section . <p> Performance : With the introduction of Mipmap Bias , the performance cost of Texture Quality has increased considerably in v1.04 . Before , performance between detail levels was minimal : <p> Now there 's a much larger gap between settings , though this can be mitigated by manually tweaking the Mipmap Bias . <p> Note : our old save no longer functions in v1.04 , necessitating a new scene . Overall performance may be vastly different , but the focus is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughness , we tested the revamp Texture Quality setting in multiple scenes and found comparative performance to be near-identical in each . <p> If you 've got a 2GB GPU , High is the recommended setting . For those with more VRAM , select Ultra to store additional textures in memory , minimizing the chance of visible streaming . You can also head on over to our tweaking section to further increase the memory budget on high-capacity cards . <p> Vignette <p> Our final Post Processing setting darkens the corners of the screen , which is nice if you like that kind of thing . <p> Regardless of the setting chosen , the appearance of Water remains unchanged in still ponds and lakes . Out in the oceans in wholly unsuitable boats , and on wind-swept lakes , the difference between detail levels is immediately evident , with waves and ripples gaining increased detail as the setting is raised . Behind the scenes , it 's revealed that Water Quality adjusts the DirectX 11 Tessellation Factor of water , doubling the detail level at every step . <p> On High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat to realistically bob up and down , and for Geralt to create ripples when swimming . Without the simulation , things get real funky , with Geralt and boats unaffected by waves , as you can see below in our video clips . <p> Water simulation enabled <p> Water simulation disabled <p> Performance : Given the wackiness that occurs without water simulation , every player will want to aim for High . Luckily , its cost is minimal . <p> With an accessible configuration file there 's plenty of opportunity to meddle with The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt 's settings , pushing them beyond their defined maximum values to further increase image quality , assuming you have the necessary hardware , of course . <p> First , configure in-game settings to your liking , then exit the game . Head to C : **25;426;TOOLONG Witcher 3 and backup user.settings . Open user.settings with a text editor , such as Notepad++ , and edit one or more of the values described below . Save your modified file , and in Windows Explorer right click on it , selecting Properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apply " . This will prevent The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt from overriding your changes , allowing you to enjoy the tweaked visuals . <p> Detail Level Tweaks <p> The in-game Detail Level setting is limited to adjusting the visible range of static decals . In the config file you can further increase their visibility , and the visibility of other related items , too . <p> We 're fairly certain that DynamicDecals are the animated pools of blood that ooze out of slain monsters , but the other options we can only guess at given the limited time available to us . <p> In another section of the config file you can increase the chance of decals spawning ( not every sword strike results in an emitted decal on ' 1 ' ) , and increase the distance at which decals will spawn , allowing distant enemies to emit blood spatter when hit . <p> You can also experiment with the **25;453;TOOLONG and cvMaxAllowedDecalsSS values under Budget , which could result in an increased number of decals in large battles . We ca n't say for sure though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Foliage Quality Tweaks <p> If wish to increase the number of trees visible on the horizon , MaxVisibilityDepth would be a safe bet , you 'd expect , seeing how it controls this exact function in the Foliage Visibility Range setting . However , higher values had zero impact in our testing , suggesting a hard-coded limit . <p> **26;480;TOOLONG Ultra value : 24 <p> Something that does work is option to increase the rendering quality and visibility of trees via FoliageDistanceScale . <p> **40;508;TOOLONG Ultra value : 1 <p> In most scenarios , the impact of higher values is the addition of extra detail on distant trees , and an increase of fidelity on leaves and smaller branches . <p> The hit to performance for such a minimal increase in image quality certainly is n't justified , making this tweak one for top-end systems only . <p> You can also try to edit the cvMaxAllowedSpeedTree value under Budget , which may increase the number of high-quality SpeedTree trees rendered in the distance ( at a certain point high-quality SpeedTree models are transitioned to lower-quality versions for performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify a location that benefits , but with more time you may . Do let us know if you find a working example . <p> Grass Quality Tweaks <p> The in-game Grass Density and Foliage Visibility Range settings adjust the visibility and fidelity of grass , and in the config file you can push things significantly further at the expense of many , many frames per second . <p> As the interactive comparisons show , cranking up GrassDistanceScale adds foliage across the valley until it hits a hard limit on the opposite slope . <p> A value of " 3 " delivers good improvements with only a moderate performance cost , but doubling that again to " 6 " slaughters performance even on our mighty SLI TITAN X test system . At lower resolutions , " 6 " would be playable , though much of the added detail would be obfuscated by the unavoidable reduction of clarity from decreasing the pixel count . <p> **25;550;TOOLONG slightly increases the density of grass , most visibly around Geralt . The trade-off appears to be less accurate grass placement , causing some tufts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> The performance cost of **25;577;TOOLONG is tiny ; the question is , " do you want thicker grass , or more accurate grass placement " ? <p> If you have spare performance after ramping up grass ' rendering quality , you can further increase Grass Density beyond the in-game 2400 ' Ultra ' value . <p> Unlike other settings where we can beneficially increase the detail level until the cows come home , or we hit a hard-coded limit , here we see a loss of foliage variety as the grass goes all " Day of the Triffids " and takes over the entire map . <p> At " 4800 " this scene looks pretty good , but in others " 4800 " continues to cause the overgrowth issue . At " 3600 " , however , no issues were seen , and as such we 'd recommend it for anyone looking to increase the density of grass . <p> Mipmap Bias Tweak <p> v1.04 introduces TextureMipBias , a new Rendering setting that is tied to Texture Quality . If you 're interested , the ins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , the cliff notes : mipmaps are lower-resolution versions of textures that are utilized to increase performance and minimize VRAM use . In the case of The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt , mipmaps are aggressively used for the innumerable layers of foliage that can be seen for miles , and for just about every other texture in the game . This improves performance and keeps VRAM requirements down , but results in some lower-quality foliage and surfaces in the immediate vicinity of Geralt . <p> By reducing the bias , as this new setting does , higher-resolution mipmaps are loaded at near-range , and the rate at which mipmaps are scaled down across distant views is reduced , increasing visible detail considerably . Unfortunately , this also increases aliasing and shimmering on fine detail , such as the mesh shoulder pads of Geralt 's starting armor , and the many thin pieces of swaying grass . As the bias is further reduced these problems intensify , though they can be somewhat mitigated by increasing the rendering resolution and by downsampling . Also , make sure to disable sharpening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we demonstrate the visual impact of TextureMipBias at " 0 " , the v1.03 level , and the level used on Low and Medium Texture Quality settings in v1.04 ; at " -0.4 " , the value used for High ; at " -1.0 " , the value used for Ultra ; and at " -2.0 " , our tweaked value . Focus primarily on the left side of the screen , paying particular attention to the thatched roofs , the tree and foliage near to them , and the trees before the river ( hold down ctrl and press + to enlarge these sections for a better view ) . <p> If we were to continue to decrease the bias , the distant trees on the other side of the river would be further improved , though the level of shimmering screen-wide would be intolerable . <p> Our second example demonstrates the reduced impact of the bias setting in urban environments , where objects are larger and generally seen in closer proximity . If you magnify portions of the comparisons you will note slightly increased detail on floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particularly nice improvement on the houses ' wooden panels and beams in the corner of the square . <p> What we ca n't adequately demonstrate in images or compressed video is the aforementioned shimmering , which is truly egregious as the bias is reduced below the default values . At 3840x2160 , " -2.0 " was just about OK , but at 1920x1080 it was an eyesore . Dropping down to " -1.0 " was better at 1920x1080 , but still a bit too shimmery for our tastes . In contrast , " -0.4 " offered little in the way of improvement . In the end , we settled on " -1.0 " for 3840x2160 , and " -0.7 " for 1920x1080 , though your opinion may differ , especially if you 're using sharpness filters or injected anti-aliasing . <p> If you just want things back the way they were , whilst retaining maximum-quality texturing , simply set TextureMipBias to " 0 " to return to v1.03 's look and feel . <p> You may also wish to set the new value to " 0 " to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little over 5 frames per second at 3840x2160 : <p> In conclusion , TextureMipBias delivers decent improvements to texture fidelity and overall image quality when used in moderation , and is a fantastic tool for making incredible bullshots when cranked way , way up . <p> By modifying the setting you can gain a few extra frames per second on Maxwell GPUs , and a few further frames per second on other cards that lack the MSAA rendering enhancements of our latest architecture . <p> Particle Tweak <p> It 's unclear if this is functioning , but under Budget you can modify **27;604;TOOLONG , potentially increasing the number particles rendered . Our tests suggest it may , but given the difficulty in creating 1:1 tests for a dynamic game element it 's difficult to say with certainty . <p> Shadow Quality Tweaks <p> As mentioned earlier , Shadow Quality modifies a ton of values , but its in-game maximums are limited . Via the config file , we can take full control of these many values and crank them way up , far beyond their ' Ultra ' levels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' shadows , but with a reduced Foliage Shadow value to improve performance , for example . <p> Here 's an overview of Shadow Quality 's settings and how you can manipulate them for improved shadow fidelity : <p> Given the right lighting conditions , **27;633;TOOLONG can considerably improve the fidelity of distant views . <p> CascadeShadowmapSize increases the accuracy of shadowing , which in some circumstances can ground small objects to the terrain through a newly-connecting shadow . In most areas though , the benefits are low . If you 've got the performance , however , you may as well increase the setting to at least " 4096 " to make things that bit better . <p> CascadeShadowQuality works best in concert with CascadeShadowmapSize , further improving the detail and accuracy of shadows throughout the game . <p> Our final shadow tweak enables additional bushes , trees , and clumps of grass to cast shadows on other game elements . <p> If you 're applying all of the shadow tweaks presented above , be ready for greatly reduced performance . Our advice : apply tweaks to the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if there 's still plenty in the tank continue tweaking . <p> Texture Streaming Tweaks <p> Earlier , we revealed that the Ultra Texture Quality setting merely increases the maximum number of textures stored in video memory , minimizing the chance of visible texture streaming . To increase this number , edit TextureMemoryBudget= in the Rendering section . <p> **29;662;TOOLONG Ultra Value : 800 <p> Several other values are also editable , supposedly increasing the distance at which characters , character heads , and general textures are streamed in , though we observed no benefit even with values doubled . <p> Above we 've documented what we believe to be the most useful of tweaks , improving image quality in the vast majority of scenes . Testing time has been limited though , so we ca n't rule other options just yet . For instance , many cvMaxAllowed settings under Budget show promise , but in brief tests we 've been unable to discern any image quality improvement . With more time we can undertake comprehensive testing of every setting , and with other PC enthusiasts also evaluating they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they are we 'll document them here , so be sure to let us know in the comments if an improvement is identified elsewhere on the Internet . <p> Using the tweaks verified so far , we 've already gained a considerable amount of detail as the interactive comparisons below demonstrates . <p> To amp up your graphics even further , activate Dynamic Super Resolution ( DSR ) to receive up to 4K-quality graphics on your HD monitor . How it works is simple : compatible games , such as The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt , are rendered at a higher , more detailed resolution , and the image intelligently shrunk back down to the resolution of your monitor using a custom-made filter , giving you up to 4K-quality graphics on your screen . The video below explains more , and the images show how to activate the setting in the NVIDIA Control Panel . <p> With DSR enabled , textures benefit from improved clarity , aliasing is almost entirely eliminated , objects have better definition , vegetation is more detailed , and distant game elements are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games you 'll know of these benefits already , but if you have n't had the chance here 's a look at how The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt 's graphics scale with rendering resolutions . <p> If you have the performance , increasing the rendering resolution in The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt delivers an impressive range of improvements that affect nearly every game element and scene . Together with the game 's temporal anti-aliasing solution , almost all jagged edges are removed , and there 's minimal temporal aliasing , giving players a highly detailed , super smooth , flicker free experience . <p> NVIDIA Control Panel Anisotropic Filtering <p> If you wish to sharpen distant textures and those viewed on an angle , forcibly enable High Quality Anisotropic Filtering ( AF ) via the NVIDIA Control Panel , like so : <p> In-game , a clear improvement can be seen on soil and dirt , on foliage , on distant trees , and on certain man-made surfaces . <p> Overclocking <p> If you need extra performance , overclocking your GPU will pay dividends in The Witcher 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GeForce Garage . <p> GeForce Experience : Optimal Playable Settings With A Single Click <p> The best way to configure and apply The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt 's settings on your system is through GeForce Experience , an invaluable tool for all GeForce GTX users .

@@20827398 @827398/ <h> NVIDIA GeForce GRID - A Glimpse at the Future of Gaming <p> For the longest time , PCs and consoles were the only two options available to gamers . The PC was a platform of complete freedom and the avid PC gamers relished the chance to use the latest hardware to play the latest games . Others preferred the simplicity of consoles ; although never on the cutting edge , consoles never needed upgrading and made it easy to game from the comfort of the living room . <p> Two years ago , a new technology emerged that promised to combine the merits of consoles and PCs . Known as cloud gaming , it was the latest step in the general trend of virtualizing resources in large data centers and serving them up to users on demand via the web . With cloud gaming , instead of running a game locally , a gamer 's keystrokes would be sent to the cloud where they are interpreted , the game frame rendered , and the result sent back as streaming video . Because all the heavy lifting is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the latest games without ever having to worry about their hardware . <p> When you play games from the cloud you are also not tied to a single platform like a TV or PC . Game cloud servers render a video stream that can be decoded by any device . Therefore , in the future you will be able to rent a game once and enjoy it on all of your devices : TV , PC , Tablet , Phone and iOS . <p> As a concept , cloud gaming is immensely attractive , but in reality , it has been very much an emerging technology . The main issue is latency , or the time delay associated with issuing a command and having the screen reflect that command . Today 's cloud gaming services take about 280 milliseconds . Compared to about 160 ms for consoles and sub-100 ms for the PC , cloud gaming feels too " laggy " to be considered a first-rate gaming experience . <h> GeForce GRID <p> NVIDIA GeForce GRID , a second-generation cloud gaming platform announced at the 2012 GPU Technology Conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem by reducing the latency associated with cloud gaming . To understand how it works , let 's take a closer look at the latency that exists in today 's cloud gaming services . <p> A comparison of latency by system and a breakdown of its various stages . <p> Consoles have the most straightforward pipeline . Most console games run at 30 frames per second ( fps ) . This equates to 33 ms per frame . Because three frames are buffered , this adds up to about 100 ms of latency for the rendering portion . HDMI TV displays add 66 ms of additional latency . In total , it takes about 166 ms between a command being issued and the picture updated on the screen . <p> The latency of cloud-based solutions includes all of the above plus three additional stages . When a frame is rendered on a cloud server , it must be encoded ( like a video ) , sent across the network , and then decoded on the client . These processes take up approximately 30 ms , 75 ms , and 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This extra latency is the main reason why first-generation cloud gaming feels laggy when compared to gaming on a local system . <p> GeForce GRID reduces the latency of cloud gaming by reducing every aspect of the rendering and transmission pipeline . First , it reduces the render time from 100 ms to 50 ms . This is achieved by increasing the framerate from 30 fps to 60 fps . The benefit here is twofold ; not only do gamers get reduced latency , they also get higher frame rates . The result is greatly improved perceived smoothness and responsiveness . <p> Second , the encoding and decoding time has been reduced thanks to a host of new hardware and software technologies . NVIDIA GeForce GRID 's NVENC ( low-latency encoder ) , NVFBC ( ultra-fast full-frame buffer capture ) , and NVIFR ( ultra-fast frame read back ) capabilities capture , scale , and encode a game frame in a single pass in about 15 ms , shaving 30 ms off the overall latency . <p> Finally , the network latency will be much lower with GeForce GRID . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GeForce GRID servers enable up to four power-efficient Kepler graphics processing units ( GPUs ) to be connected to each server . This means much more powerful servers , lower cost for the operator , and much wider deployment . For the same cost , operators can deploy servers in a greater number of locations , which brings down the network latency , especially if you do not currently live near a data center . <p> GeForce GRID has the lower latency than both existing cloud services and gaming consoles . A GeForce powered PC still offers the best responsiveness at under 75 milliseconds . <p> The net result of these improvements is that the latency of gaming on a GeForce GRID server will be comparable , if not better , than gaming on a console at home . <h> What the Future Holds <p> First-generation cloud gaming services gave us a glimpse of the future , but for the most part gamers today still play on PCs or consoles ; the latency , image quality , and network speed have not been at the point where cloud gaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next generation , putting the best of NVIDIA 's GeForce technology into the cloud . Just as scientists can call up NVIDIA Tesla servers to help them advance their discoveries , gamers can now call up GeForce GRID servers to play the latest games . And thanks to the latest rendering and encoding technologies , GeForce GRID dramatically lowers the latency of cloud gaming . With reduced lag , greater penetration of gaming servers , and Kepler-quality graphics , it 's not hard to imagine that , in the near future , cloud gaming will be as ubiquitous as online video . Will traditional PC gaming still be around ? Most certainly ; for those who demand the best quality and performance , it 's still the best choice . But regardless of whether you are a PC or console gamer , GeForce GRID now offers a new to enjoy your games , on any device , anywhere .

@@20827401 @827401/ <h> PhysX <h> FAQ <h> What is a physics processor ? <p> The original AGEIA physics processing unit ( PPU ) is purpose-built to meet the unique requirements of physics algorithms . These represent an environment that 's much different than a general purpose CPU . <h> What is physics for gaming ? <p> In gaming , physics is all about how objects in your game move and react to the environment around them . In many of today 's games , objects just do n't seem to act the way you 'd want or expect them to in real life . Currently , most of the action is limited to pre-scripted or ' canned ' animations triggered by in-game events like a gun shot striking a wall . Even the most powerful weapons can leave little more than a smudge on the thinnest of walls ; and every opponent you take out falls in the same pre-determined fashion . Players are left with a game that looks fine , but is missing the sense of realism necessary to make the experience truly immersive . <h> What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first dedicated hardware accelerator for PC games that enables dynamic motion and interaction for a totally new gaming experience . It 's available from leading system and add-in card makers today . <p> NVIDIA acquired AGEIA Technologies in early 2008 and continues to evolve the entire PhysX platform from both a software and hardware perspective . <h> What is the AGEIA PhysX Accelerator ? <p> The AGEIA PhysX Accelerator is an add-in card based on the PhysX processor . It enables enhanced physics in games that have been designed to support hardware-accelerated PhysX . <h> Which graphics cards can accelerate NVIDIA PhysX ? <p> All GeForce 8 series graphics cards and above with at least 256MB of local onboard graphics memory and at least 32 cores will be able to accelerate NVIDIA PhysX . If you intend to use an NVIDIA supported graphics card as a dedicated Physx card , the other graphics cards in the system must also use an NVIDIA GPU . <h> Will running PhysX on a GPU slow down gaming performance ? <p> Running physics on the GPU is typically significantly faster than running physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frame rates can be much faster . However , adding physics can also impact performance in much the same way that anti-aliasing impacts performance . Gamers always enable AA modes if they can because AA makes the game look better . Gamers will similarly enable physics on their GPUs so long as frame rates remain playable . With AA enabled , running physics on a GPU will generally be much faster than running physics on a CPU when AA is enabled . PhysX running on a dedicated GPU allows offloading the PhysX processing from the GPU used for standard graphics rendering , resulting in an optimal usage of processing capabilities in a system . <h> Can I run NVIDIA PhysX on my motherboard GPU ? <p> NVIDIA PhysX API uses the GPU ( Graphics Processing Unit ) to process the physics environment calculations in games and applications which support NVIDIA 's Physx . Physics calculations can be very complex and therefore as a system requirement , a GPU must feature 256MB of dedicated local video memory , support NVIDIA 's CUDA technology and also have 32 cores or higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card does not meet these requirements , you will not be able to use the GPU to process NVIDIA Physx calculations . <h> Does PhysX scale across the GPU and CPU ? If yes , does that mean having a faster CPU enhances PhysX performance or visual quality ? <p> PhysX uses both the CPU and GPU , but generally the most computationally intensive operations are done on the GPU . A CPU upgrade could result in some performance improvement , as would a GPU upgrade , but the relative improvement is very dependent on the initial balance of the system . An optimized PC with the right mix of CPU to GPU horsepower will be the best balanced solution . <h> Intel and AMD say it 's better to run physics on the CPU . What is NVIDIA 's position ? <p> PhysX runs faster and will deliver more realism by running on the GPU .

Intel and AMD solutions , which utilize the Havok API , are fixed function only and can not scale . <h> How does PhysX support heterogeneous computing ? <p> PhysX shows how heterogeneous computing delivers the best user experience . While the game is running , the PhysX system executes portions of the physical simulation on the CPU and other portions on the parallel processors of the GPU .

For a look at how Depth of Field is improved on PC , enabling the creation of cinema-style cutscenes , skip to the Depth of Field section . <p> Ambient Occlusion <p> Ambient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or objects meet , and where objects block light from reaching another nearby game element . The AO technique used and the quality of the implementation affects the accuracy of AO shadows , and whether new shadows are formed when the level of occlusion is low . Without Ambient Occlusion , scenes appear flat and unrealistic , and objects float on surfaces . In The Phantom Pain we see Screen Space Ambient Occlusion ( SSAO ) employed , as it was in Ground Zeroes , albeit with a name change in the settings menu . <p> While far from the best technique available , SSAO is nonetheless a welcome addition ; without its inclusion image quality would be diminished as the following comparisons demonstrate . <p> The above comparisons were from Ground Zeroes , where the effect of settings can be more clearly seen due to the tight packing of content to fit within the game 's small play area , and an abundance of man-made structures with detailed industrial-design . In The Phantom Pain , in contrast , the massive zones are wide-open , punctuated by the odd structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlements and locations . To date , the places we 've visited have yet to rival the detail and density of Ground Zeroes ' military base , though once The Phantom Pain servers are online players can import Ground Zeroes ' save games to revisit the location . As such , the effects of settings are generally better demonstrated in Ground Zeroes as the on-off differences are immediately evident . <p> In comparison , here is the much-more subtle impact of Ambient Occlusion in The Phantom Pain : <p> Performance : As the Ambient Occlusion technique and implementation is unchanged in The Phantom Pain , the comparative performance impact of the setting 's options are almost identical in the most detailed area we could locate . <p> Note : Ambient Occlusion is dependent on " Post Processing " Medium , or higher , also being enabled . <p> If you 're seeking extra performance simply lower Ambient Occlusion to High and regain a handful of frames per second , as during gameplay you 're unlikely to notice the difference in fidelity , especially when crawling along your belly at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post-Processing Anti-Aliasing , Bloom , and other effects were grouped together in the Screen Filtering setting , with no options to adjust each individual effect ( until modders found a way ) . <p> Like Motion Blur , Depth of Field divides opinions , so to save everyone the effort of modding files Depth of Field is now available as a dedicated setting . However , this only affects gameplay , as famed game director Hideo Kojima progresses The Phantom Pain 's story with Hollywood-style cinematics , replete with simulated out of focus camera effects . <p> On PC , Depth of Field is upgraded from a ' gather ' technique to a ' scatter ' technique , enabling better transitions between focal areas , and variable blurring per frame . The resolution of the blur has also been greatly improved to reduce artifacts , and artist-controlled Bokeh effects are now included , enabling Kojima and co. to apply out of focus shapes to specific game details , as demonstrated below . <p> Using identical frames from the PlayStation 4 edition of Ground Zeroes , we can exemplify this engine-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactive comparison . <p> Depth of Field is focused and applied by the cinematic director . Without it , the fidelity and ' style ' of cut scenes suffers greatly . <p> A second comparison from the PlayStation 4 edition of Ground Zeroes further highlights the PC 's massively improved Depth of Field effects , which apply less blur in the foreground , and higher quality blur in the background . <p> During gameplay , Depth of Field is used when aiming with weapons , when crouching , when driving and riding in vehicles , and to blur portions of the screen for stylistic effect , as the following interactive comparison demonstrates . <p> Performance : Extensively used throughout the game , Depth of Field adds an extra bit of style , and in our opinion is well-worth using . With a performance cost of around 5 frames per second though , it may be a tad too expensive for some . Our recommendation : sacrifice things like Extra High Ambient Occlusion first , and only turn off Depth of Field if absolutely necessary . <p> Effects <p> The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special effects until an in-game , non-interactive cutscene at its conclusion . In comparison , The Phantom Pain is filled with effects from the off , taking a major toll on performance in many scenes , and causing sudden framedrops throughout the game . These effects take the form of fog , dust storms , rain storms , thunder storms , explosions , weapon impacts , grenade smoke and visual effects , gadget effects , dust effects from movement and actions , and much , much more . <p> This dramatically-increased use of effects has one of the largest impacts on performance in The Phantom Pain , and will undoubtedly force max settings Ground Zeroes players to lower settings or resolution . <p> As in Ground Zeroes , the difference between detail levels is in the number and quality of particles , and the density and quality of other effects . Direct comparisons are tricky as effects are always moving and slightly randomised ; below , you can view one of the clearer examples we managed to capture , highlighting the accuracy and fidelity of the effect , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail level . <p> Further complicating capture and benchmarking is the introduction of dynamic weather , a day-night cycle that constantly changes lighting and shadowing , and a cloud system we 'll get to later . As part of that dynamic weather system , rain returns from Ground Zeroes , though it is now supplemented by heavier storms and thunder and lightning . <p> As in Ground Zeroes , the number of rain drops and their quality is reduced as the detail level is decreased . Drops that remain are stretched out to simulate the appearance of heavy rain , but unless you 're looking up through a spotlight beam , as in our comparison , it 's unlikely you 'll notice the difference during gameplay . <p> The other effects are too random to properly show in comparisons , so instead please peruse the following screenshots that show some of the new effects in action . <p> Performance : As touched upon earlier , the number of effects being rendered can put serious strain on performance in The Phantom Pain , as exemplified by our performance numbers below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its number would be a solid 60 frames per second , meaning even on Low an intensive set of effects can send frame rates plummeting by over one third . A further sizable drop comes from enabling Extra High , which ramps up the fidelity of the effects far above what 's possible on consoles , and improves the quality of light and shadow interaction , blurring shadows cast on smoke , for example . <p> At lower resolutions the impact of Effects and its Extra High setting are n't as extreme , but even on our GTX 980 Ti system Extra High managed to push our performance below a locked 60 frames per second at 2560x1440 , which did n't happen with any other setting . <p> If you 're an all-guns-blazing player be prepared for a rougher time , as your guns , gadgets and grenades will spawn many more effects , and as the enemy fights back with mortars , machine guns , tanks , and helicopters , your field of view will be filled with explosions and smoke . For sneakers , performance is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance impact at higher-resolutions during cutscenes and when initiating multiple Fulton extractions . <p> Regardless of your gaming style , Effects Extra High is worth trying at lower resolutions , just to see if your system can cope . If it ca n't , kick it down to High . At 4K or even 5K , you 'll need a top-end system or high-end SLI system to avoid framedrops below 30 , such is the intensity of Effects Extra High at higher resolutions . <p> Lighting <p> Recent years have seen game engines gravitate towards deferred rendering and lighting , enabling the creation of realistically-lit scenes that contain additional dynamic lights and improved lighting all around . As with almost everything newer and better , the performance impact is higher , especially when making full use of its capabilities . On consoles , the number of dynamic lights in Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain is limited , as clearly shown by the comparisons from each game below : <p> On PC performance is n't an issue , enabling Kojima Productions to render all lighting simultaneously , greatly improving image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In The Phantom Pain , however , settlements and developed locations are spread far and wide , and in our time with the game have never approached the density or visual complexity of Camp Omega . Nevertheless , Lighting has a high impact on image quality during any night mission , with its Extra High setting being a must-have on any system . <p> Throughout The Phantom Pain you 'll frequently return to your base of operations , which expands as you invest in its capabilities . Here , the impact of Lighting Quality is best seen in The Phantom Pain , with the base 's many lights being disabled beyond a short range . It 's also worth noting that with the game 's massive draw distances and level of detail scaling , even Extra High ca n't enable lighting on the distant , connected base buildings , which is unfortunate as this would greatly enhance the appearance of the zone as you fly in at night . <p> Performance : With most Phantom Pain locations having fewer lights , the performance cost of Lighting is ever slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one whole frame per second . <p> With a high visual impact in most night scenes , it 's strongly recommended that you lower other settings before downgrading this high-impact setting , which offers considerable benefits above and beyond the obvious due to its influence on shading and shadowing . <p> Model Detail <p> The Fox Engine 's poorly-named Level of Detail setting adjusts the amount of visible geometry in a scene , the number of objects rendered , the quality of said objects , and the density of foliage . Across our screenshots and comparisons you 'll see thinner tufts of grass , fewer cacti and bushes , fewer power lines , less detailed objects , and less detailed buildings , all at medium to long range distances . At close range , the occasional bush or piece of grass is thinned out , but on the whole Model Detail has a minor impact on image quality . <p> In The Phantom Pain , the sparser environments make the impact of Model Quality even harder to spot . For example , in this set of images the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but under closer examination we can observe the removal of detail on and around buildings , and the eventual removal of terrain decoration and small tufts of grass . <p> Performance : Lowering the setting 's detail level has a minimal impact on image quality in screenshots , but during gameplay you will encounter additional pop-in and fade-in as objects and other affected items are approached . Your tolerance for this will likely dictate your choice of setting if you 're in need of performance , but even looking out across the most detailed locations you 're only going to regain a couple of frames per second by selecting Low . In our opinion , it 's a poor trade that merely diminishes the experience . <p> Post Processing <p> In Ground Zeroes , players could enable Screen Filtering , a collection of visual effects that included Anti-Aliasing , Bloom , Depth of Field , and the PC-exclusive Screen Space Reflections , which helped differentiate the PC release from the console launch nine months prior . <p> Now , the setting 's known as Post Processing , and with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First and foremost , Screen Space Reflections no longer feature , to the best of our knowledge , having failed to find examples in any unlocked location or mission . If you checked out our Ground Zeroes guide you 'll have seen that only specific puddles could clearly reflect detail , while a few other select surfaces could reflect light or blurred detail , such as the truck in our comparison . <p> In The Phantom Pain , said puddles are nowhere to be seen because the dynamic weather system does n't dynamically create and destroy them , and similar-looking trucks appear to lack the same reflective properties . In areas where bodies of water can be found , such as the marshes and rivers in the second gameplay zone you unlock , we have yet to discover any real-time reflections , and in many cases not even pre-canned , simulated reflections . <p> In one interior gameplay location , highlighted in a comparison below , reflections of select objects were cast on the floor , but even with Post Processing set to Off they were still rendered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeroes . In cut scenes , sun glasses and gas masks are occasionally rendered with reflections , as are a couple of mirrors at the start of the game ( which we ca n't show for fear of spoilers ) , but their level of fidelity and the fidelity of the aforementioned gameplay reflections fall far below that of Ground Zeroes ' real-time Screen Space Reflections . <p> The quality of the reflection is marginally better on Extra High , but nowhere near the level of fidelity seen on Ground Zeroes ' special Screen Space Reflection surfaces . <p> September 7th Update : Having now played almost all of The Phantom Pain , we can confirm that reflections are only used in a few locations , typically under very specific lighting conditions , and are only viewable from select angles and distances . Furthermore , their quality is far below that of the reflections in Ground Zeroes , and they are always enabled regardless of the settings chosen , which is probably why they are of a lower quality . <p> Outside of a few scenes in the Prologue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some subtle uses in Mother Base under very specific conditions , the most visible use of these reflections is in a late-game mission that we 're hopefully not spoiling in the interactive comparisons below . <p> For reasons unknown , the reflections are slightly more visible on detail levels other than Extra High in this mission . <p> On High , Post-Process Anti-Aliasing is enabled as it was in Ground Zeroes , and as before its quality remains uneven : moderate screen-wide blurring is observed in all scenes , yet aliasing remains on certain game elements , even at 4K . In Ground Zeroes , modders discovered a workaround to enable and disable specific elements of " Screen Filtering " , allowing for the injection of superior post-processing solutions like SMAA , which tackled aliasing issues . Expect the same to occur here shortly after launch . <p> 1920x1080 interactive comparison <p> 3840x2160 interactive comparison <p> High is also necessary for Ambient Occlusion and Depth of Field to work , making its performance impact considerable . If the two interlinked settings are disabled we observe performance reductions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low-cost post-process anti-aliasing technique being the only addition at this detail level . <p> Furthermore , in addition to enabling Depth of Field ( if the dedicated Depth of Field setting is also enabled ) , High and Extra High adjust the quality and precision of the blur , too . <p> Performance : Despite the supposed removal of Screen Space Reflections , and the relocation of Depth of Field to a separate option , the performance impact of the setting formerly known as " Screen Filtering " is drastically higher in The Phantom Pain . The likely cause is a combination of the game 's increased scale , larger focus on action , and increased number of effects , which are enhanced by the Post Processing setting . This in particular comes heavily into play on Extra High , where the improvements to Depth of Field and many other effects have a considerable impact on performance . <p> If you 're in search of extra performance , dial Post Processing down to High , and decrease the quality of Ambient Occlusion and Effects to High , reducing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post Processing . Despite the high performance cost , you 're unlikely to want to go lower until you can override Anti-Aliasing and Ambient Occlusion . <p> Shadows <p> On PC , Shadow Quality is significantly improved , with clear , well defined shadows visible on Extra High . Similarly , shadow filtering is bolstered , tackling the vast majority of shadow aliasing on max settings . Finally , the number of simultaneous shadows that can be rendered has been greatly increased , creating richer scenes full of dynamic shadows cast by Lighting 's extra deferred lights . For a look at console shadowing , skip back to our earlier section . <p> With a switch to rural environments full of trees , bushes and grass for The Phantom Pain , Shadow Quality gains extra importance when in close proximity to foliage , but across a wider view the simpler , more organic game elements are n't as greatly affected by a reduction in shadow quality . And in the desolate deserts , shadows are few and far between . <p> To better highlight the importance of higher-resolution shadows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only present in the PC release , please excuse us while we switch back to Ground Zeroes , where the busy , highly-developed , man-made Camp Omega environment created more complex shadows than we 've seen to date in The Phantom Pain . <p> Performance : A progressive increase in shadow quality is observed as the quality level is raised , and with each tick up there 's a minimal decrease of performance , on par with that seen in Ground Zeroes . <p> If you 're searching for extra performance , drop Shadow Quality to High if you really must , but we would n't recommend going any lower - on Medium there 's an appreciable reduction in shadow quality in all scenes , and Low sees the complete loss of all shadow definition , harming image quality substantially . <p> Texture Filtering <p> The Anisotropic Filtering introduced by Texture Filtering sharpens The Phantom Pain 's textures ever so slightly in the majority of scenes , but occasionally clearly more visible examples of its benefits can be found , such as on muddy surfaces . The Ground Zeroes comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image quality on such surfaces , but offers a clearer look at the improvement thanks to the lighting conditions and terrain decoration . <p> Performance : As in most games Texture Filtering has a minute cost and should be maxed out on all systems . Note , the addition of NVIDIA Control Panel Anisotropic Filtering has no noticeable impact on image quality , unlike in many other games . <p> Textures <p> The Phantom Pain PC uses the same textures as The Phantom Pain PS4 , though with the addition of improved Texture Filtering , higher display resolutions , improved Depth of Field , improved Post-Process Anti-Aliasing , and various other tweaks , they appear sharper and clearer on PC . <p> As in Ground Zeroes , the Fox Engine prefers to reduce the quality of distant textures before decreasing the quality of those most visible , and never decreases the quality of Snake 's texturing . With terrain decoration , visual effects , and maxed out Texture Filtering , the differences between Extra High and High are nigh on imperceptible , and on Medium only select surfaces in specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textures and objects do suffer as you would expect , but not to the extent seen in other titles . <p> Performance:The Phantom Pain 's cross-platform textures are n't the sharpest or most detailed you 'll see , though they are perfectly adequate . Helping matters , the many post-process effects in play obscure the occasional low-res object or surface , and with your eyes firmly locked on guard movements and enemy sight lines texture quality typically is n't an issue , especially if you 're doing it right by sneaking at night . And , as expected , Texture Quality has a negligible impact on performance , meaning there 's no reason to use anything other than Extra High , assuming you have the necessary VRAM . <p> In our Ground Zeroes Graphics &amp; Performance Guide we concluded that a 2GB GPU was sufficient for the highest-quality textures in the enclosed Camp Omega , and pondered whether 2GB would also be sufficient in the wide-open Phantom Pain . Following a several hour , non-stop session on a 2GB GPU , and several benchmarks , the answer would appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No adverse effects were observed , and no stutters recorded . For 4K , meanwhile , 4GB is all you appear to need . <p> Volumetric Clouds <p> In Ground Zeroes , you could on occasion observe dynamic cloud shadows on the terrain during daytime Side Ops . Now , you can select whether to enable or disable the clouds that cast those ever-so-subtle shadows , courtesy of The Phantom Pain 's new Volumetric Clouds option . <p> Performance : Some extra detail in the sky adds to image quality when you look up , and on the ground fidelity is increased ever so slightly given the right lighting conditions . However , at a cost of 8 frames per second Volumetric Clouds may be a tad too expensive for some . <p> NVIDIA Dynamic Super Resolution <p> Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain benefit greatly from higher rendering resolutions , more so than any other games in recent memory , as the rendering of many game elements is directly tied to the number of sample points : if an element is n't within a sufficient number of sample points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of sample points is increased , additional game elements are rendered , and overall fidelity greatly improved . <p> If this is the first you 're hearing of sample points imagine your screen with a grid overlaid : each pixel of a game element , be that a blade of grass , a character , an object , or a building will fall within one or more of the grid 's squares , and if half or more of a pixel is inside a square it is correctly rendered . In most instances fine detail is only affected to any great extent by this , with several pixels falling outside of squares , preventing them from being rendered . This leads to grass with visible gaps along the blades , and leaves with missing branches , to name but two examples . To rectify the problem the screen resolution can be increased , adding more squares to the grid , each smaller in size , giving fine detail a greater chance to fall sufficiently within a square and be rendered . <p> In the case of the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the resolution increases , but as it does we also see entirely new items rendered , most typically in the background where even guard towers and trees are comparatively small . The cause : these game elements are required to be included in a specific number of sample points before being displayed . This makes sense at sub-HD resolutions as sub-HD players a ) would n't be able to see the detail , and b ) would have their performance improved by the removal of the extra polygons . However , even at 1920x1080 when running max settings at a locked 60 frames per second we still are n't seeing everything Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain have to offer , with new detail being introduced even at 3840x2160 . <p> Ground Zeroes ' densely packed locale benefits significantly more than The Phantom Pain 's sparser locations , therefore remaining the better game to highlight the improvements that are possible with an increase of resolution . <p> In comparison , one of the more detailed locations we 've found to date in The Phantom Pain changes little across resolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of geometry . A closer look reveals the loss of some grass and small objects , and a decrease in geometric detail of cliffs in the background , but for the most part the detail level remains unchanged . <p> Despite the lack of significant detail-related improvements in the scene , image quality does increase considerably , with much-improved anti-aliasing , higher-quality effects , clearer texturing , and much , much more . <p> Thankfully , you no longer have to buy a 4K monitor , or dabble in the black art of Custom Resolutions to get a 4K-quality picture . Instead , simply activate NVIDIA Dynamic Super Resolution ( DSR ) . How it works is simple : compatible games , such as Metal Gear Solid V : The Phantom Pain , are rendered at a higher , more detailed resolution , and the image intelligently shrunk back down to the resolution of your monitor using a custom-made filter , giving you up to 4K-quality graphics on your screen . The video explains more , and the images below show how to activate the setting in the NVIDIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new resolutions to enable DSR . <p> With DSR enabled , Metal Gear textures are sharper and clearer , aliasing is reduced , objects have better definition , vegetation is more detailed and free of artifacts , and distant game detail is improved by the aforementioned increase in sample points . Below , additional interactive comparisons exemplify the massive increase in quality obtained from enabling 4K DSR in The Phantom Pain . <p> One of the Fox Engine 's weaknesses is that it suffers greatly from sub-pixel artifacts , which can occasionally be seen even at close range at 1920x1080 . By switching to a higher resolution artifacts are removed , or eliminately entirely , and detail is increased considerably . <p> At 1920x1080 , the number of sample points is too low to render the fine detail in chain link fences and similarly detailed surfaces , resulting in a patchy , transparent apperance at medium range . At 4K , the increase in resolution benefits them massively , and as the detail is rendered it can also be lit during night missions , further improving image quality . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the resolution is increased . Here , building lights and a wooden pallet are only rendered at 2560x1440 , and higher resolutions . <p> Larger scene elements can vanish , too . In this example , we observe a cliff line failing to render because of insufficient sample points . <p> The best way to examine these improvements , free from Photoshop scaling , is to download the source images below , open each in Windows Photo Viewer or a similar application , zoom in on specific portions , and compare side by side using Windows ' half-and-half display mode . <p> Performance : At reference speeds , our reference GeForce GTX 980 Ti ran at a locked 60 frames per second until 2560x1440 in our demanding benchmark , which used a spoilerific , fairly repeatable segment of gameplay to test as many effects and features as possible . <p> For greatly improved performance , a few settings can be dialed down a notch , but for 60 FPS at 3840x2160 you 'll definitely require a high-performance SLI system or Battlebox given the increased demands of The Phantom Pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gear Solid V : The Phantom Pain 4K Screenshot Gallery <p> You 've seen the up-close benefits of Dynamic Super Resolution and 4K in our interactive comparisons above . Now , see the wider impact of higher rendering resolutions in our 4K screenshot gallery . <p> G-SYNC : Eliminating Stutters &amp; Tearing For The Ultimate Experience <p> NVIDIA revolutionised computer displays in 2013 with the introduction of variable refresh rates , enabling gamers to enjoy highly responsive , tear-free , stutter-free experiences on G-SYNC monitors .

@@20827410 @827410/ <h> An Interview With a League of Legends Season 2 Champions - TPA <p> Last month , we had the opportunity to ask competitive League of Legends team Taipei Assassins ( TPA ) a few questions following their Season 2 World Championships victory . Read on to find out what MiSTakE , Stanley , Lilballz , Toyz and Bebeisadog had to say about LOL tactics , being the underdog , and the future of eSports . <p> - <h> GeForce.com : Taipei Assassins ( TPA ) has undergone all kinds of battles since it was officially formed in March this year . NGF , GPL , Go4LOL and IPL5 Taiwan preliminaries through to Season Two must have created many memories for each player and helped them gain valuable experience . Is there anything special that you would like to share with gamers ? <p> TPA : I think the most memorable game for TPA was undoubtedly the first offline competition that TPA had ever taken part in - NGF . Even though we lost 1:2 to the Chinese team WE , the competition allowed us to experience the enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time . I will always remember how our fans turned up to each TPA game to cheer us on . Offline tournaments are challenging to players because you must adjust to the venue , climate and time zone . All of these are issues that each athlete must contend with before the start of the match . <h> GF : Before the start of Season Two , TPA was ranked rather low internationally . Apart from practicing again and again , how did TPA beat the odds to take the championship ? <p> Taipai Assassins : Believe in yourself , prepare for every eventuality , do your best during the competition and never give up . <h> GF : Many gamers still remember how everyone cheered for TPA during the grand final against Azubu Frost . With all the pressure from the finals , how did you feel ? Did it inspire you in any way ? <p> TPA : This was the first time that the audience cheered for TPA at the LA venue . We really enjoyed the feeling and it energized us for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw how Toyz dominated with Orianna during Season Two . Interestingly enough , Toyz 's scoring records showed that Orianna made only rare appearances while characters like Graves and Vayne had the most exposure . Was this a part of your " tactics " or is Toyz planning to change tracks ? <p> TPA : We tried our best to find characters that suited our team 's playing style over the sixty or so days we spent in team training . We also adjusted and practiced certain tactics . As team training consisted mostly of private games with other teams instead of ranked matches , the frequency of character usage did not accurately reflect the heroes that we favored for the competition . <h> GF : During Season 2 , gamers saw all kinds of outstanding performances from top teams across the world . TPA trains frequently with players from Europe , America , Korea and other regions as well . Can TPA provide a brief analysis on the habits , strengths and weaknesses of players from different parts of the world ? What are the strengths of Taiwanese players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique and try to use it to secure an advantage early in the game . During the world championship however , all of the players had similar skills levels , making it difficult for this approach to make a decisive impact . European teams tend to emphasize team make-up and team battles so their team really shines when all five players are gathered together . Asian teams put the emphasis on speed , so they try to gain an early advantage in the fog of war and map resources then snowball from there . <h> GF : The period between 2011 Dreamhack and Season One can be considered as a golden age for the EU style . This year , TPA 's new tactics during Season Two such as reverse EU and Duo Mid have generated widespread discussion among gamers . Are there any special tricks to how TPA develops its tactics ? <p> TPA : These tactics are usually the product of constant practice against other teams . If you are defeated by a tactic , you try to master it and turn it as your own weapon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practice it until it becomes a strategy that is hard for other teams to copy and learn . <h> GF : Congratulations on the two new additions to TPA - Zonda , the top-lane specialist , and GoDJJ , in charge of AD . Are there any plans to introduce a new jungler to share the load with Lilballz ? For new members , what are the cooperative and training methods used by TPA to help them become a part of the team and familiarize themselves with the tactics as quickly as possible ? <p> TPA : We usually allow a new member joining in as support during practice and online matches in order to identify areas that need adjustment or improvement . New players are usually quite skilled already and only need to get familiar with the team 's playing style to perform well in future matches . <h> GF : Riot has frequently mentioned its interest in making new support champions but the results have been less than satisfactory to date . Just out of interest , is there any trait essential to a support according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in-house " support champions that you would personally recommend from your routine practice sessions ? <p> TPA : A good support champion needs an ult that does n't consume equipment stats to boost damage . Ideally , it should come with crowd control effects , excellent poke ability or a large selection of control skills . Zyra and Yorick are good support champions . Zyra is particularly recommended for practice games . <h> GF : As many gamers know , the character Tristana has apparently been permanently banned by Retty , your coach , from Bebe 's champion list . Can you share with us what happened ? There are also rumors that Tristana may be remade in the future . Before the remake happens , does Bebe have anything to say for himself and the cute gunner ? <p> TPA : During an offline competition in China , we picked Tristana and lost the game . The coach joked that we should never pick Tristana again because we lose every time with her . That 's how the joke about fining people for picking Tristana came to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match for other popular AD characters . There is also the problem with pushing . Hopefully changes will be made along these lines in the future . <h> GF : A lot of people do n't really understand eSports . Most people probably think that eSports is just another type of sport . But " what exactly is eSports ? " I am sure that TPA must have arrived at a definition of its own after all this time ! <p> TPA : eSports is in fact very much like other competitive sports . As athletes , we invest a great deal of time and effort in practice . We are also constantly challenging our limits and competing for the highest honors . During the competition , the athlete must stay calm , pay attention to detail and coordinate with team mates in order to win honor for the team . <h> GF : TPA must have provided some inspiration for young people interested in joining eSports in the future . I think TPA should take this opportunity to say what is in their hearts to the parents of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning the championship will change society 's view of eSports . People will learn about the work of professional athletes and see that the staff takes the job seriously . In this way , parents can learn to respect their child 's other developments and allow them to pursue their dreams in a safe manner that does not impact their studies or career plans .

@@20827414 @827414/ <h> Epic Talks Samaritan &amp; The Future Of Graphics <p> May 10 , 2011 <p> By Andrew Burnes <p> At this year 's Game Developers Conference , attendees were wowed by Epic Games ' Samaritan presentation , a sneak peak at the visual fidelity achievable with Unreal Engine 3 and the horsepower of three NVIDIA GeForce GTX 580 graphics cards . Offering a world first look at a real-time demonstration constructed entirely in DirectX 11 , Epic 's Samaritan demo set tongues wagging , and served as a wake-up call for those in the industry still languishing in the dark ages of DirectX 9 . <p> In the opening frames of the demo , one of the most talked-about advancements is shown . Known as Bokeh Depth of Field , it is an upgrade to the standard out-of-focus blurring seen in games of recent years , but has in fact existed for over a decade , having been demonstrated by the now-defunct 3dfx using their famed Voodoo T-Buffer in 1999 . The Bokeh component of the new technology relates to the out-of-focus , definable shapes seen in television and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or visual quality of a scene . Derived from the Japanese word " boke , " which literally means " blur , " Epic Games ' Martin Mittring believes that the effect is far more than mere obfuscation , in that " it allows you to lead the viewer 's attention and creates depth , " an effect that is " very important for storytelling , which is an integral part of today 's games . " Mittring , Epic Games ' Senior Graphics Architect , also believes that " this effect can be distracting , " but , " in some situations it can be used to improve aesthetic quality , like when aiming through a weapon . " <p> The first frames of the Samaritan demo immediately show Bokeh Depth of Field effects to the left of the Epic Games logo . <p> The main use of Bokeh Depth of Field will be for cut scenes , where developers can predefine the shape of the virtual camera 's lens , which dictates the shape of the blurred objects , as seen in the example below . Mittring is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs quite fast on modern graphics cards , " but is equally willing to admit that there 's some way to go to before matching the filmic effect mastered by Hollywood 's best and brightest over several decades . To attain " better interaction with other features like translucency , proper occlusion and motion blur , " Mittring and his colleagues will require more powerful hardware and better software development tools , but for the time being those are some ways off . <p> Three examples of the artist-defined Bokeh effects available for use in Unreal Engine 3 . <p> An example of the Bokeh effect , as seen in the Samaritan demo . <p> The technology for the Samaritan demo took eight months in itself to develop and implement , work having first begun in June 2010 , when NVIDIA Developer Technology Engineer Bryan Dudash and his team initiated development of Epic 's Unreal Engine 3 DirectX 11 RHI graphics wrapper code , which in layman 's terms allows the Unreal Engine to output anything that utilises the advanced features of DirectX 11 . Epic 's engine team pre-planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the actual Samaritan demonstration , which had been storyboarded and meticulously prepared in advance . " For the final stages of the demo 's development , NVIDIA engineers performed performance analysis and debug to make sure that the demo made the most efficient use of the GPU power available , " adds Dudash , with work continuing apace on all sides , right up until the unveiling of the Samaritan demo on March 2nd , 2011 . <p> An early storyboard mapping out the Samaritan scenes and the technologies they should highlight . <p> As already mentioned , the demonstration ran in real-time on a 3-Way SLI GeForce GTX 580 system , but even with the raw power that configuration affords , technological boundaries were still an issue , and for that reason , Daniel Wright , a Graphics Programmer at Epic , felt that " having access to the amazingly talented engineers at NVIDIA 's development assistance centre helped Epic push further into the intricacies of what NVIDIA 's graphics cards could do and get the best performance possible out of them . " Being a tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other overheads of an actual , on-market game , but with enough time and effort , could the Samaritan demo run on just one graphics card , the most common configuration in gaming computers ? Epic 's Mittring believes so , but " with Samaritan , we wanted to explore what we could do with DirectX 11 , so using SLI saved time . " <p> Early Samaritan concept art for a visual style not used , though elements did transfer to the final demo . Note the billowing coat , the use of shadow , and the foreboding darkness that manifests itself as a corrupt police force in the final demo . <p> In all likelihood , a game of equal fidelity wo n't be a reality until the next generation of graphics cards , but in a chicken and the egg situation , how can hardware be developed for the next generation of graphical technology when it has yet to be programmed ? For Samaritan , SLI allowed to everyone to bypass this dilemma , utilising the raw power of the three graphics cards with an ample helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epic was " the definition of a win-win , " as Dudash puts it . " Working with Epic was an amazing experience . Their engineers are at the forefront of graphics knowledge in the industry and they have some of the top artist talent out there . " <p> " Through the course of making a challenging and technologically advanced demo like Samaritan , " continues Dudash , " we learnt a lot about the types of features that are useful , and which are difficult to use . Additionally , we found the limitations of the current APIs and feature sets , both in hardware and software . " This newly acquired wisdom , " will work its way into our future hardware designs , as well as driver updates . " Concluding , NVIDIA 's Developer Technology Engineer has some complimentary comments for Epic : " It 's been a real pleasure working with them on this demo . I ca n't wait to see what they come up with next . " <p> As the Samaritan demo transitions into a street scene , looking down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 features combine to create an unprecedented level of detail and immersion . The element that draws the eye first is that of the wet street and sidewalk , featuring as it does , numerous textures , elevation changes , and light sources . <p> The opening scene of the Samaritan demo , showing Point Light Reflections , billboards , and many other technologies . <p> Eschewing traditional Phong and Blinn-Phong techniques , which were unable to produce the desired , reflective look , Epic 's new specular , Point Light Reflections are as close to real ' as current technology allows , as exemplified by the following photo reference and in-engine comparison . <p> A real world example of the aforementioned techniques . The real-time result ( below ) , features a smoother street surface that can reflect the background detail and surroundings in an aesthetically pleasing manner that would be otherwise impossible if the real world example were emulated exactly . <p> The in-game result . Note the breaks in the reflected light from the non-uniform surfaces . <p> The point lights referenced in the technology 's title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street scene in the reference photo , a multitude of different textures are utilized , as is non-uniform road , concrete and pavement placement , allowing reflections to be interrupted , manipulated , and occluded by static and dynamic objects , whether they be street furniture or moving vehicles . As Epic 's Mittring points out , the " wet street scene is dominated by reflections , and bright objects appear to be mirrored everywhere . " To achieve this , other technologies are layered into the scene , and together they are collectively known as Image Based Reflections . <p> In addition , Samaritan introduces Billboard Reflections , created through the use of a textured billboard and accurate lighting to replicate the board 's design . These billboards can be placed like any other object in the Unreal Engine editor and the light they emit can be reflected upon any surface , accurately , with relative ease . These reflections can then be shown in detail , or blurred for extra , dramatic effect , and multiple billboards can be introduced , with their lighting combining accurately , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this billboard technology is a dramatic improvement over existing reflection techniques , and the methods it employs can be built upon in the future to light and reflect entire scenes . <p> A billboard 's light can be accurately reflected off of multiple surfaces , or tweaked by the designer to create a specific effect . Glossiness is affected by the material 's specular power and its distance from the light source , which in this example results in the wet floor appearing brighter than the nearby wall . <p> Three examples of the same scene manipulated using isotropic reflections and varying levels of blur . <p> To ensure that this advanced lighting does not clip or leak through objects and geometry in a scene in an unrealistic fashion , Static Reflection Shadows are created when developers compile and render their levels , and to guarantee the same result on moving objects , such as the police car in the Samaritan demo , Dynamic Reflection Shadows are generated in real-time from the position of the camera or character 's viewpoint . <p> An example of Static Reflection Shadows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image . <p> An example of Dynamic Reflection Shadows , grounding the robot and car to the terrain , whereas on the right , without DRS , they appear to float . <p> Such is the importance of Image Based Reflections , and the effect that they have on the fidelity of a scene , it comes as no surprise that they are , " the most expensive parts of the demo , " as confirmed by Mittring . Of the collective group of effects , Billboard Reflections , and their occlusion and shadowing , are singled out as the most costly , performance-intensive effects in the entire Samaritan demo " a small price to pay for a significant technological upgrade . <p> Epic 's commonly-used Powered by Unreal Technology ' motif and slogan , rendered as a billboard in the Samaritan demo . Note the reflections on the surfaces and objects to the right . <p> Balancing out the cost of Image Based Reflections is a DirectX 11 lighting technique called Deferred Shading . In Unreal Engine 3 titles developed using DirectX 9 and DirectX 10 , the lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic lighting calculations being crunched in advance while other elements of a scene are rendered . With Deferred Shading , geometry rendering is handled separately and the lighting calculations broken down into smaller components that are written to the graphics buffers and combined later in a deferred pass ' when required , instead of writing the result immediately to the frame buffer . The result is that the computational power and memory bandwidth required to accurately light the scene is reduced , and by only shading visible portions and not those obscured by buildings or other objects , the complexity of the scene is reduced and frame rate is increased . <p> According to Epic 's Mittring , Deferred Shading " has a higher performance cost for simple scenes , but with complex geometry and many lights the method pays off . As we are limited by what can be done in a small fraction of a second , we get more geometry detail with more lights . " Indeed , in the opening street scene of the Samaritan demo , one hundred and twenty-three dynamic lights are visible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times faster in comparison to the DirectX 9 Forward Shading of old . <p> The one hundred and twenty-three deferred lights used in the opening scene of the Samaritan demo . Note the removal of the police car in the right lane of the road , leaving only its dynamic red and blue lights .

@@20827424 @827424/ <h> Virtual Reality <h> Related Links <h> Technology <p> Virtual Reality is finally here after years of anticipation , and it 's been well worth the wait . At NVIDIA we 've been working from the beginning of VR 's resurgence to create technologies , tools and best practices that enhance the VR experience . <p> Now , with the new GeForce GTX 1080 and the new Pascal Architecture , we 're enabling a new level of presence in VR by introducing new technologies that will make your VR experiences more immersive and realistic . <p> With VR performance is key - Virtual Reality headsets render games and applications at a resolution equivalent to 3024x1680 , and need to do so at a sustained 90 FPS . Failure to maintain a constant 90 FPS results in stuttering and hitching that ruin the experience . <p> With the new GeForce GTX 1080 , Virtual Reality performance is up to 2X faster than with the GeForce GTX TITAN X. This remarkable improvement comes courtesy of the amazing graphics horsepower of Pascal , combined with our new Simultaneous Multi-Projection technology , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering techniques . <p> For decades PC gamers enthusiastically enjoyed their games on flat 4:3 , 16:9 and 16:10 monitors . Thankfully technology has advanced , and we can now play with three monitors in NVIDIA Surround , on curved monitors , and even in Virtual Reality . <p> With the new Pascal-architecture Simultaneous Multi-Projection technology we can implement several new techniques that improve your experience on these displays . And in Virtual Reality , improve performance , too . <p> The first of these new Virtual Reality techniques is Lens Matched Shading , which builds upon the Multi-Res Shading technology introduced alongside our previous-generation Maxwell architecture . Lens Matched Shading increases pixel shading performance by rendering more natively to the unique dimensions of VR display output . This avoids rendering many pixels that would otherwise be discarded before the image is output to the VR headset . <p> Single Pass Stereo turbocharges geometry performance by allowing the head-mounted display 's left and right displays to share a single geometry pass . We 're effectively halving the workload of traditional VR rendering , which requires the GPU to draw geometry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right eye . <p> This improvement is especially important for geometry-heavy scenes , and those featuring significant levels of tessellation , which remains the most effective way of adding real detail to objects and surfaces in VR . <p> With tessellation , affected game elements can be accurately lit , shadowed and shaded , and can be examined up close in Virtual Reality . With other solutions , such as Bump Mapping or Parallax Occlusion Mapping , the simulation of geometric detail breaks down when the player approaches or examines affected objects from any angle , which harms immersion . By increasing geometry performance and tessellation by up to 2x , developers are able to add more detail that players can examine up close , significantly improving the look of the game and the player 's level of presence . <p> NVIDIA has spent decades working to perfect 3D graphics , but with VR great graphics demand great audio to create a sense of presence . To this end , NVIDIA has created a game-changing advancement called VRWorks Audio . <p> Today 's VR applications provide positional audio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , sound in the real world reflects more than just location of the audio source -- sound is a function of the physical environment . For example , a voice in a small room will sound different than the same voice outdoors because of the reflections and reverb caused by the sound bouncing off the walls of the room . Using NVIDIA 's OptiX ray tracing engine , VRWorks Audio is able to trace the path of sound in an environment in real-time , delivering physical audio that fully reflects the size , shape , and material properties of the virtual world . <p> Simply put , we 're able to simulate physically-accurate , super realistic real-time audio using the power of your graphics card . <p> If you 've been a gamer for some time you 've almost certainly played a game with CPU or GPU PhysX , or our new FleX effects . These technologies add more realistic physics effects , and enable interactions between the player 's character and the world they 're inhabiting . In Virtual Reality , more often than not you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interacting with objects and the world itself . As such , the world needs to react realistically to maintain the user 's sense of presence in the virtual world . <p> Realistically modelling touch interactions and environmental behavior is critical for delivering full presence in VR . And by adding touch interactivity with haptics we can amplify the degree of immersion . <p> Existing VR experiences deliver these effects through a combination of positional tracking , hand controllers , and haptics . With NVIDIA 's new VR Touch PhysX Constraint Solver , we can instead detect when a hand controller interacts with a virtual object and enable the game engine to provide a physically-accurate visual and haptic response . <p> By providing this improved , ready-made , all-in-one solution to game developers we can save them time , effort and money , and improve the experiences of gamers . <p> As you might expect , we 're also bringing our PhysX and FleX visual effects to VR , so that interactions , events and actions involving the player or occurring around the player are realistic , physically accurate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real world . <p> Over the years PhysX and FleX have created visual effects for just about anything you can imagine - explosions , cloth , water , snow , gore , volumetric weather effects , and on and on , and on .

If you 're water cooling the cards , you can get by without this extra slot , but for air-based cooling it is a necessity . <p> The clear air between the two GeForce GTX 590 graphics cards ensures that thermal performance remains within acceptable limits . <p> Quad SLI certified motherboards that have the correct connector spacing for use with dual GTX 590s are as follows : <p> ASUS Maximus III Extreme <p> ASUS P6T7 WS Supercomputer <p> ASUS P8P67 Deluxe <p> ASUS P8P67 Pro <p> ASUS P8P67 WS Revolution <p> Asus Rampage III Extreme <p> ASUS Rampage III Formula <p> ASUS Sabertooth P67 <p> DFI LanPartyDKP55T3EH9 <p> EVGA P55 E658 <p> EVGA X58 FTW3 <p> Gigabyte GA EX58 Extreme <p> Gigabyte GA-P55-UD5 <p> Gigabyte GA-P67A-UD5 <p> Gigabyte GA-P67A-UD7 <p> Gigabyte GA-X58A-UD7 <p> Gigabyte GA-X58-UD9 <p> MSI Big Bang " Trinergy <p> MSI P67A-GD65 <p> MSI X58 PRO-E <h> CPU <p> With the combined power of four GTX 500 GPUs , Quad SLI can be easily bottlenecked by the central processor . Therefore , it 's important in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Core i7 CPUs with Turbo Mode enabled are highly recommended , and for even better performance , you may even want to consider overclocking your processor . <h> Power Supply <p> Operating a Quad SLI GTX 590 system requires a power supply that has four 8-pin PCI-Express supplementary power connectors , each of which must receive 150 watts . Because of the complexity of designing , building and ensuring that the power supply meets these necessary requirements , NVIDIA works directly with power supply manufacturers to certify their products for Quad SLI use . The list of power supplies certified for use with a Quad SLI GTX 590 configuration is as follows : <p> AcBel PC8055-000G 1100W <p> Antec HCP-1200 <p> Corsair AX1200 <p> Nexus RX-1.1K Gold <p> Silverstone ST1500 <p> Thermaltake Toughpower W0171 1500 <h> Chassis <p> A good computer case provides the proper airflow for cooling the graphics cards , without sounding like a jet engine . The optimal chassis has multiple fans that draw in cool air and push out hot air , with a large fan positioned on the door or side panel to blow cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support an 11 inch graphics cards . As with the power supplies , NVIDIA works with manufacturers to ensure that their cases are certified for use with Quad SLI configurations , and as of today the list of certified cases is as follows : <p> Coolermaster HAF X <p> Silverstone Raven RV02 <p> Thermaltake Element V <h> Watercooling <p> While the right case and air-cooling setup can result in low temperatures in a Quad SLI PC , water cooling can take thermal performance to the next level , resulting in an even cooler , quieter system that can be heavily overclocked . We 've worked with several of the top water cooling companies in the world to build custom water blocks for the GeForce GTX 590 , including : <h> System RAM / Operating System <p> For the best performance possible in a Quad SLI configuration , 6GB of system memory is highly recommended , and because of this the use of a 64-bit operating system is required . Windows 7 64-bit is recommended , though Windows Vista 64-bit will also suffice . <h> System Design Considerations <p> Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , here are a few tips for building your rig : <h> 1 ) Cable management <p> Keep your power and SATA cables tidy and out of the path of airflow between the system fans and the graphics cards . The same applies for hard drives , optical drives , and any other cables . <h> 2 ) System fan settings <p> Check your BIOS to make sure your system fans are set to high to maximize thermal performance , or enable PWM-cooling so your system remains quiet when idle , but cranks up the fans automatically when heat levels rise . Utilities like SpeenFan can allow you to dynamically control your system fans based on the temperature of the GPUs. <h> 3 ) BIOS <p> Make sure you have the latest BIOS firmware for your motherboard - important updates may be available that improve PCI Express and SLI performance , or enable compatibility with new components . <p> With the correct Quad SLI-certified components and some basic system-building skills , you should be well on your way to a having a great Quad SLI gaming PC , capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutions .

@@20827429 @827429/ <h> Introduction to SLI Technology <p> PreviousNext <h> Introduction &amp; Overview <p> By Andrew " Exitios " Dolicho <h> Introduction <p> Games appeal to a gloriously excessive nature ; we take on endless hordes of enemies through a hail of bullets , slay ferocious beasts in a flurry of might and magic , lead armies to victory against nefarious empires , eradicate menaces throughout the galaxy and , if we have the time , maybe even save a princess or two . And what do we do when that 's all done ? We do it again , but with MORE ! We want bigger challenges , faster completion times , and stronger upgrades . We simply want better results , and gamers expect no less of graphics : we want well-defined lighting and shadows , crisp textures , detailed worlds , natural physics , clean edges , and , most importantly , high frame rates . When it comes to hair-raising visual effects at ballistic speeds , NVIDIA 's SLI technology is a special power-up . <h> Overview <p> This guide will introduce NVIDIA 's SLI technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thousands of PC games . In this we will find out what exactly SLI is , examine how it works , explore the various hardware requirements , break down the different visual settings and components available in the NVIDIA Control Panel , and understand how to make it all work best for us . The level of detail here wo n't be extreme , but there is a lot to cover , so if you 're in the mood for something that 's easier to chew give -RaptoR- 's SLI FAQ a look . <h> What is SLI ? <p> The best way to start would be learning what SLI actually is , so let 's jump right to it : SLI is a multi-GPU ( Graphics Processing Unit ) scaling engine , essentially a method of using more than one graphics card to boost in-game performance by up to +100% per additional GPU . The principle is beautifully simple , and it is equally simple to use because the technology is neatly contained within all modern GeForce graphics drivers and many GeForce GPUs . We 'll cover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's take a closer look at how SLI functions . <p> NVIDIA 's SLI technology is an exercise in parallelism , which GPUs already do on a massive scale . Commonly , SLI systems are identified as being " n-Way SLI " configurations , and within the context of this guide : " 2-Way SLI " applies to any system using two graphics cards in SLI ; " 3-Way SLI " for any system with three graphics cards in SLI ; and " 4-Way SLI " denoting any system with four graphics cards or GPUs in SLI ( so as to be applicable for two dual-GPU cards in SLI . ) By allowing multiple graphics processors to independently work on rendering a single 3D environment , we can theoretically multiply our frame rate by the number of new GPUs . This is accomplished through the graphics driver , which determines how the GPUs will behave and assigns what data they will be responsible for rendering . With the scene loaded up - and once the CPU finishes " pre-render " tasks like setting up vertices for objects , collision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and network communications - the SLI-linked graphics cards receive the rendering information that determines what will end up on the screen and how it will appear . This data is shared between the cards in their own individual memory spaces since they are all rendering the same environment , and from there , it comes down to how the GPUs are working together : Alternate Frame Rendering ( AFR ) for supercharged performance or SLI Antialiasing ( SLI AA ) for exceptional image quality . <h> Alternate Frame Rendaring ( AFR ) <p> Alternate Frame Rendering is the performance rendering mode for SLI , and it works by designating a particular frame subset to each GPU . In a 2-way SLI configuration , for example , GPU 1 would render all odd-numbered frames while GPU 2 renders all of the even-numbered frames . When using three or four GPUs , the GPUs render one of every three or four frames respectively . The essential principle behind AFR is keeping the GPUs working as independently as possible for maximum performance gains , and that takes a well-defined SLI rendering profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles all the time , so check for new GeForce drivers often ! If you would like to submit a request for an SLI profile update for a game or 3D application , click here . <h> SLI AntiAliasing ( SLI AA ) <p> SLI Antialiasing is an image quality-focused rendering mode that divides an anti-aliasing ( AA ) workload between the GPUs for smoother edges at a reduced performance cost . In 2-way SLI , both GPUs will render the exact same frame , but perform sub-pixel sampling using offset coverage points that will be merged together to provide a much smoother-looking image . This option is available for 3-way and 4-way SLI systems , and behaves similarly . This mode is ideal in cases where performance is already acceptable but higher image quality is desired ; by sharing the AA work between the GPUs , the appearance of a game is improved with no performance lost compared to running a single GPU . For example , 2-way SLI AA 8x would offer the performance of a single GPU running 4x AA , yet the image quality would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control Panel , for all application profiles in the " Antialiasing - Mode " drop-down menu , and will automatically ignore/override established SLI rendering modes for that profile . <h> GPU Scaling <p> Before we continue any further , let 's pause to consider what defines multi-GPU systems : scaling . By this we mean how much benefit we 're seeing from additional GPUs , be it one ( 2-Way SLI ) or three ( 4-Way SLI , ) in contrast to single-GPU performance . Ideally , performance would increase linearly with the amount of devices introduced , meaning if we added a second GPU we 'd see our performance double . Realistically , 2-way SLI can come very close to that . 3-way and 4-way SLI systems can yield impressive results as well , however they are liable to show diminishing returns as a result of becoming progressively more limited by the CPU . <p> How well SLI scales depends on how efficiently the game is able to handle multiple GPUs , how developed the SLI profile for that game is , and also how busy we can keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility in the scaling equation : making sure the GPUs are the bottleneck in our system . This is not so straightforward , however ; because we can define hardware boundedness purely by which subsystem we 're waiting on the longest - be it only a few milliconds or a few dozen - scaling is n't exactly predictable or consistent within even a single area of one game because rendering conditions can change very rapidly , but as we 'll see in a moment , there is another side to bottlenecking that can be born from multi-GPU systems <p> If we were to massively simplify the process of creating a frame in an 2-Way SLI system then measure how long each component took to complete its share of the work , it might look like one of the images below . Each individual frame is first prepared by the CPU and then handed off to a GPU to be rendered as illustrated . <p> These representations may seem extreme , but they are n't unrealistic . To the left we see a 2-Way SLI system that is completely restricted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much faster than the CPU , there is absolutely no performance gain to be seen with the addition of a second graphics card . On the right we see that each of our GPUs take far longer than the CPU to render , and the presence of a second graphics card has effectively doubled the frame rate . The CPU even has enough downtime to accommodate a third graphics card for better performance ! <p> As stated before , however , this is n't how things will look all of the time . It 's entirely possible that the CPU may only be minimally slower than the GPUs or vice versa , and that is just enough for us to either begin observing lower GPU scaling or under-utilisation in additional GPUs . While it 's true that additional performance will still be seen under this condition , how much we actually benefit is what becomes the big question , so let 's examine a case where a second graphics card is added into a system where the CPU only slightly outpaces the GPU in its tasks : <p> Introducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurable performance gain of about +15% , however our GPUs have a lot of downtime that was n't present before . More importantly , our CPU is now constantly busy preparing new frames , and with each GPU completing its frame long before the CPU can provide it with another , we 're back to being CPU-limited . If we want to see more use out of our second graphics card , that means we have some tweaking to do . <p> In the context of this illustration : for 2-Way SLI systems , the goal would be for our CPU to take , at most , half as long to pre-render a frame than it does for a GPU to render one . Neither component would necessarily be limiting the other and we get to see the full benefit of our second GPU . If you want to add another GPU or two in later , though , we 'd have to trim down the CPU 's time or increase GPU rendering time quite substantially . For 3-Way and 4-Way SLI configurations , the CPU should take at most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single GPU . <p> Regardless of how many GPUs we 're trying to manage , the takeaway message should be that this is n't necessarily a bad position we 're in . That GPU downtime means we have the ability to increase our game 's image quality at a lower cost to our frame rate or perhaps no cost at all , and if we were to keep pushing forward with that idea , we 'd be able to force our GPUs to become the system bottleneck and further improve our GPU scaling . <p> We could try overclocking our CPU in order to try and reduce that GPU idle time , however this is only good up to a certain point , and it is n't necessarily an option for everyone in the first place . Some much simpler options include increasing the game 's resolution ( playing on multiple monitors , for example , ) increasing graphics settings or enabling new ones ( ambient occlusion , antialiasing , depth-of-field , draw distance , field of view , HDR , lighting effects , motion blurring , PhysX , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. ) or upgrading to 3D Vision . All of these options will not only make our game look better , but it will also increase the GPU render time which can translate to better performance scaling . <h> Requirements <p> Now that we 're familiar with what SLI is and what it does , let 's look at what we 'll need to use it . There are three key areas we 'll have to focus on : the graphics card , the motherboard , and the power supply . GeForce.com maintains detailed lists for all three of these components , so everything you 'd need to know and buy can be found just a few clicks in the SLI Technology section . <h> The Graphics Card <p> If you 've bought an NVIDIA GeForce GPU in the second half of the last decade or so , then chances are good that you already own an SLI-ready graphics card . There are also very few restrictions regarding what GPUs can be grouped together in SLI : only the model and memory amounts have to match . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paired with another GTX 580 that has 1.5GB of memory , and a GTX 690 only with another GTX 690 . Beyond that , manufacturers can be mixed ( e.g. ASUS with MSI , EVGA with PNY , ) clock speeds may vary ( stock versus factory-overclocked , ) the VGA BIOS for each card can be different , and no special drivers or software is required . Below is a chart with modern retail SLI-ready GeForce graphics cards , all of which are at least capable of 2-way SLI ; specially marked GPUs can run in configurations of 3-way or 4-way SLI when proper requirements ( motherboard , power supply , operating system ) are met . <p> It 's worth noting that in the case of pairing graphics cards with discrepant clock speeds , the driver will not attempt to synchronize their frequencies unless you instruct it to through tools like EVGA Precision or MSI Afterburner . This is completely optional and not doing so is n't likely to cause any adverse effects , but some people find it 's easier/stabler to overclock with the GPUs running at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with asynchronous clocks , it 's recommended the faster GPU is installed as the primary so single-GPU or low-scaling applications can benefit from its slight performance advantage . <h> The Motherboard and Power Supply <p> With the GPUs picked out , we 're in need a motherboard that can support multiple PCI-Express NVIDIA GPUs and a power supply that will drive all of that hardware . You can view comprehensive lists of both SLI-ready motherboards and high-performance PSUs by clicking on the appropriate icons below ( geforce.com ) . <h> Configuration <p> There 's not much left except to start using SLI and begin fine-tuning our system for optimal performance and image quality . We 'll start with getting set up , enabling SLI , and finally learn what settings in the NVIDIA Control Panel can make a real difference in our games . <h> Bridge Installation <p> With the cards installed on the motherboard and connected to the power supply , it is strongly encouraged that users also install the SLI bridge ( provided with all SLI-ready motherboards . ) A two-pronged bridge is used for 2-way SLI while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very high-end motherboards may additionally provide an 8-pronged bridge , meant for 4-way SLI between four discrete graphics cards ( as opposed to 4-way SLI with dual-GPU graphics cards like the GTX 690 . ) There is technically no " proper " orientation for the 2-way bridge , and if two cards running in SLI have two goldfinger ports ( indicating support for 3-way SLI ) the bridge does not need to be installed on a particular set ; two separate 2-way bridges may be used as well , but this would be purely aesthetic as no performance gains would be earned . Although the bridge is not explicitly required to enable 2-way SLI with most GPUs , it provides a dedicated communication pathway for the GPUs to exchange data across . When this link is not present the PCIe bus will become the means of communication , which can degrade performance . 3-way and 4-way SLI configurations must use the bridge as a result of the amount of data being shared . <h> Activation <p> It should be stated first and foremost what types of SLI are supported on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Vista , Windows 7 , Windows 8 , and Linux. 3-way and 4-way SLI are supported on all 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Vista , Windows 7 , and Windows 8 . If you are using multiple monitors , click here for requirements and connection diagrams . <p> When the OS detects that your new graphics card(s) have been installed , the NVIDIA GeForce graphics driver will then check them for SLI compatibility . If they pass , the NVIDIA Control Panel will reflect this by adding or updating a new section of the 3D Settings tree called " Configure SLI , Surround , Physx . " Click on that link to open the configuration panel , which will contain several radio buttons ( some of which may be grayed out if you are not running more than one monitor . ) As shown below , all that is required is selecting the " Maximize 3D Performance " option and clicking " Apply " at the bottom-right of the NVIDIA Control Panel . Your screen will blacken and flash , possibly several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SLI . Once the desktop returns , you will be asked if you 'd like to keep or revert your settings within the next few seconds ; if you do not select an option before the time runs out , the drivers will revert to a non-SLI state as a failsafe in case your monitor does not return at the end of the process . <h> The SLI Visual Indicators <p> Knowing how well SLI is scaling does n't have to be all about knowing exactly how many frames per second you had with just one GPU . The NVIDIA Control Panel includes a tool specifically to measure SLI scaling : the visual indicators . With SLI enabled , just click any link in the " 3D Settings " tree and at the top will be a menu also called " 3D Settings . " There will be a " Show SLI Visual Indicators " option , and click it to enable it . If there is a check beside it , it is enabled . If there is not one , it is disabled . Two white vertical bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a green box in the middle . The box will grow in size as SLI scaling increases , so a tall box means excellent GPU scaling while a shorter box indicates more limited performance gains . <h> Configuration <p> All that remains is to break down these application profiles we 've been talking about so much . In the NVIDIA Control Panel 's " Manage 3D Settings " tab , we have the option of choosing between a global profile and one for an application . The global profile affects how the GPUs will render by default . That is , unless an application profile has been altered to use a certain setting , it will use the global settings ( ex : if we use 16x anisotropic filtering in the global profile , all games will run with 16x anisotropic filtering . ) Application profiles can control visual settings for specific games or applications which override the global settings , permitting finer levels of control for optimum performance and image quality on an individual basis . To decipher the array of options , let 's separate the visual settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce observable differences in how an object or surface will look in a game , while functional settings change how the GPU behaves . <h> Visual Settings <p> Ambient Occlusion : Commonly referred to as AO , this is a shading technique which approximates shadows created by edges on or around an object , like a knight 's suit of armor or a mug on a tabletop . The result is more realistic shadows , although this will have the GPUs working noticeably harder to produce the effect . Applications that support ambient occlusion natively may also support for driver-level ambient occlusion , but be careful to only enable one at a time as both AO implementations will be used and overlap each other , costing additional performance and perhaps introducing artifacts . Want to learn more ? Read the GeForce.co.uk Ambient Occlusion Guide . <p> Anisotropic Filtering : When your GPU wraps a texture around an object , its surfaces will almost never be facing you perfectly flat . Instead , any given surface will probably be at an angle - sometimes a very extreme one - meaning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one texture for this object becomes insufficient , even if it 's very high-resolution , because the surfaces at steeper angles wo n't receive enough detail and thus appear blurry . For this we depend on something called mipmaps , which are pre-rendered , differently-stretched versions of one texture that can be used depending on the angle and distance of a object surface . Anisotropic filtering adjusts how much these mipmaps are used , with higher levels progressively sharpening far-off textures or those at sharper angles . Typically this only has a minimal impact on performance with modern hardware . <p> Antialiasing - FXAA : Antialiasing , explained in detail below , traditionally smooths the edges of objects by taking multiple colour and depth samples at very precise points within a single pixel before rasterisation . FXAA is NVIDIA 's new approach to antialiasing , and it has quite a few advantages : it 's easy for games to support , it can have significantly higher performance and lower memory usage compared to standard multisampling , smooths edges on objects and transparent textures , and can smooth edges at virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make text appear fuzzy , so it 's recommend to leave this disabled on the global profile and either enable it on a per-application profile basis or through the application itself . <p> Antialiasing - Gamma Correction : When antialiasing the edge of an object , the combination of color samples is n't always perfectly represented on the monitor , and so sometimes antialiasing can produce unusually-coloured " halos " around edges . This setting reduces this by changing the way the colors are combined , consuming no extra performance . Only affects OpenGL applications . <p> Antialiasing - Mode : This allows the user to determine whether the application determines the type of antialiasing used ( application-controlled , ) if the driver brute-forces its own setting in the application profile ( override , ) if the driver applies antialiasing in addition to the game 's ( enhance , ) or if antialiasing is disabled entirely ( off . ) Overriding/Enhancing antialiasing may require the application already be using at least 2x MSAA . Enhancing a game 's antialiasing mode will improve image quality by applying additional sampling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Setting : There are only so many pixels in a monitor - a finite level of detail . While this is fine for giving us crisp text and sharp lines , it becomes a problem when we try to view a line or edge at an angle that is n't absolutely vertical or horizontal because it must go from one column or row of pixels to the next . This creates a sharp and jagged appearance that can be very distracting , especially as edges become more complex . This is known as " aliasing . " Antialiasing , as you may expect , is a way of reducing the prevalence of these jagged edges . This is done by taking multiple data points within each pixel and blending them together so transitions between two objects appears more smooth and natural . The impact on performance and image quality increases with the setting used . Click here to see a visual comparison of different modes . <p> Antialiasing - Transparency : Although antialiasing works very well on actual objects , it ca n't sample colours on the edges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . Transparency Multisampling is less expensive to use than any of the Supersampling modes , but only works in DirectX 9 applications and wo n't offer as much of an image quality improvement . <p> Texture Filtering - Anisotropic Sample Optimisation : When " High Quality " texture filtering ( see below ) is not used , you could opt to exchange a slight amount of image quality for performance in anisotropic filtering . This usually wo n't have any effect visually , but if textures do seem to " crawl " when you move in-game , try turning this off . <p> Texture Filtering - Negative LOD Bias : The LOD bias , or a Level of Detail bias , is a number used by the GPU to determine which mipmaps to use when drawing a texture on a surface . Some games will attempt to use a negative LOD bias to sharpen textures ( since this calls for using larger mipmaps , ) but this can also cause textures to crawl or shimmer . Setting this to " Allow " will permit negative LOD biases to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LOD bias from dropping becoming negative . Only affects OpenGL applications . <p> Texture Filtering - Quality : This controls how many optimisations are applied to textures , with four separate levels to choose from : High Quality , Quality , Performance , and High Performance . High Quality applies no optimisations whatsoever to a texture , while Quality will only use optimisations that do n't affect a texture 's appearance . Performance and High Performance will both apply stronger optimisations to offer better performance at the cost of image quality . <h> Functional Settings <p> CUDA - GPUs : If you 'd prefer , you can specifically designate which of your CUDA-enabled GPUs can be used for computing purposes ( including PhysX . ) <p> Maximum Pre-Rendered Frames : The CPU must always be at least one step ahead of the GPU so it has time to prepare each frame , but when there is ample time , the CPU can prepare up to 8 frames ahead of the GPU ( up to 4 is selectable through the NVIDIA Control Panel . ) Being set that high can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce some lag to your mouse and keyboard actions . Lower values ( default is 3 ) mean the CPU will draw fewer and fewer frames ahead , which can reduce input latency . Only effective for non-SLI configurations . <p> Multi-Display/Mixed-GPU Acceleration : This is to ensure compatibility with single or multi-monitor configurations . When using a single monitor , this should be set as " Single Display Performance Mode " unless significant visual artifacting ( unrelated to GPU overclocking or overheating ) is seen , in which case " Compatibility Performance Mode " should be selected instead . If using more than one monitor , this ought to be set at " Multiple monitor Performance Mode . " If you notice artifacting on a multi-display setup , you may select the compatibility mode to remedy the situation . <p> Power Management Mode : Modern GPUs are built to work in one of several " power states , " which are predetermined clock speeds that are meant to correlate to the amount of work being done by the GPU . If the GPU is not being used much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to consume less power and produce less heat . When the GPU starts working hard its maximum performance state can be activated , which applies higher clock speeds to yield better performance . By adjusting the performance of the GPU with the amount of work it does , our system can more efficiently manage its resources . This is how the " Adaptive " power management mode works , and although this process is typically not noticeable , performance enthusiasts may yet prefer that their GPUs always be in their high-performance state . In that case , there is the " Prefer Maximum Performance " setting , which locks the GPU in its highest power state while the application is running . This setting has no effect on desktop idle speeds and temperatures when changed in the global profile . <p> SLI Performance Mode : This controls the SLI rendering mode used globally or with the specified program . 2-way SLI configurations will have access to Single-GPU , Alternate Frame Rendering 1 , and Alternate Frame Rendering 2 modes . 3-way and 4-way SLI configurations , in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-way AFR modes . In many games and applications , the rendering mode is set to a pre-configured and optimized setting using options not available through the NVIDIA Control Panel directly . If changes are applied to this setting for a game , the Restore button will bring back NVIDIA 's custom mode . <p> Threaded Optimisation : The driver can allow multi-threaded 3D applications to utilise a second physical processor for better performance and workload balancing . " Auto " is the recommended option for best compatibility with both older and newer programs , and may need to be disabled if problems occur . <p> Triple Buffering : Graphics cards render frames using a technique called double buffering . The GPU stores the frame currently being displayed on your screen into its " front buffer , " while the frame it 's currently rendering resides in the " back buffer . " When the GPU is done rendering the frame in the back buffer , the front buffer is cleared out and the contents of the back buffer are copied into the front buffer , ready to be displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this process is due to how vertical synchronization works ( covered below . ) When the GPU has a frame in its front buffer and has finished rendering the frame in its back buffer , it must wait for the monitor to refresh itself and be ready to show a new frame before the back buffer can be copied over to the front . During this time , the GPU is doing no work at all . Triple buffering forces the card to create a third buffer , a " middle buffer , " to act as a second back buffer . The GPU is now able to keep working when it 's waiting for the monitor to refresh because it can complete the frame in the back buffer , then immediately begin working on the next frame in the middle buffer . This may introduce slightly higher input latency at lower frame rates . This can only be used in conjunction with vertical synchronization . <p> Vertical Sync : Vertical Synchronisation is the act of limiting the number of frames per second your GPU can create , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a display with a refresh of 60 Hz would mean you could achieve a maximum of 60 FPS . This has the benefit of eliminating " tearing , " or the noticeable overlapping of incomplete frames , though with the chance of affecting smoothness . Vertical sync may be forced on or off , or with Release 300 drivers , be set to Adaptive . Adaptive vertical sync dynamically toggles synchronization , enabling it when your FPS is the same the monitor 's refresh rate to avoid tearing , then disabling it when it falls beneath that to avoid stuttering . Adaptive V-Sync can also be set to function at half the refresh rate for applications where the observed frame rate is approximately half the display 's refresh rate ( ex. 25-35 FPS on a 60 Hz display ) to provide smoother gameplay in more demanding circumstances .

Alex 's rig hit close to 1 million people on NVIDIA Facebook pages worldwide and dozens of thousands of Likes and Shares and is one of the best designed rigs we have seen so far . This is one of the main reasons we decided to talk to Alex and find out more about his passion for modding and the story behind his masterpiece so far . <p> Alex , 26 years old , lives in Romanian western city of Cluj-Napoca , and spends his days designing all sorts of projects , from classy home interiors to cool urban setups . He discovered his passion for modding at an early age and since then has dedicated an immeasurable amount of time to this area . <p> " I was lucky enough to own a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can still remember that beige 386- PC that introduced me to the world of computers , and the DOS and Windows3.11 software . Oh , the memories ! Soon after that my parents bought me a more up-to-date model . The first day that I got it I was so curious that I just opened it up - voiding the warranty , mom was n't happy about that . The PC featured an Athlon CPU and a GT 5200 FX GPU - that 's right , NVIDIA fanboy right from the beginning . It was love at first sight " , recalls Alex . <p> First project <p> " My first modding project involved painting a PC case . It was absolutely perfect if I may say so myself ! The funny thing is that the case is still being used by a friend of mine . After that I started following PC-forums and began to want more and more to create something I could use every day " <p> " The All-In project " <p> " The All-in project is my best modding yet and I want to thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a term used in gaming but also because everything is included in the desk , from the components to the peripheral devices . Initially I wanted to 3D print it , but the technology was not there yet , at least not when I tried . I wanted it to be different , not just a case fitted in a table , as most of the rigs are , but to have a unique design and components layout . While I was designing the blueprint for the 3D model , I changed my mind and decided to use metal for the mod . I think the minimalistic design and the slim lines makes the desk very customizable for the people who want to include it in their furniture set " . <p> Components and work load <p> " Most of the components I acquired from suppliers in Romania . For the watercooling part however , I turned to EKWB and Aquatuning , from abroad . This project took so much time because at first it started as a side-project . I spent hours and hours trying to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , clashing , right ? I must have dozens of versions for the exterior body as well as for the components layout inside my 3d program and sketchbook . When I started working on the design , I did n't  even know the basics of watercooling , but after careful research and no forums and tech youtubers like Jayztwocents I caught on and implemented it in the design . Basically , it took me a very long time because I wanted it to be perfect " <p> Hardest stage <p> " The hardest part was the implementation of the design , especially as I had n't worked with metal before , I did n't know how to properly measure the pieces , how much it could sustain before it would bend , what were its limitations and so on and so forth . At first I worked with a company specialized in cutting metal but they actually blew it with the first prototype ( yes , there was another prototype ) . The finishing touches were horrible , the desk was extremely heavy , at around 100 kilograms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity though to test some essential principles , for example , how good was the airflow and how hot the glass would become upon extended usage of the rig . Will it break ? Will it resist scratches ? How much dust would it accumulate over time ? The first prototype helped me answer all of these questions , so even if it did look horrible , it helped me a lot . The tests had positive results almost every time , so I had the opportunity to fix some of the flaws for the final prototype . <p> Money spent <p> " Please , let 's not talk about this subject , my wallet is still depressed about it . All I can say is that , aside from the main components and the watercooling , trying to create a customized rig , at least on this scale , is very expensive . <p> Similar projects <p> I design new stuff every day and try to bring something new , from cases to other work-desks .

So , if there 's someone out there interested in talking more about this kind of projects , hit me up . Fortunately , there are some events that help me engage people with similar passions , as Dreamhack and Comic Con . <p> Design studies and work schedule <p> You do n't really need to take design courses to begin modding . Personally , it helped me in the blueprint stage .

My favorite titles start with Bomberman , which I use to play on my first 386-PC , and continue with Red Alert , Warcraft series , WoW , League of Legends and many more countless AAA titles . My advice for those trying to create their own rig is to measure twice , cut once , there 's no ctrl-z IRL , not yet .

American McGee , the game 's director , put a violent , unusual spin on the tale , helping the game stand far apart from the me too ' titles of the age , which resulted in it selling over 1.5 million copies . Following a couple of aborted attempts at a sequel , Electronic Arts announced in 2009 that American McGee and his Shanghai-based development studio , Spicy Horse , were working on a direct follow-up that would continue the tale . Having reclaimed her sanity in the original game , Alice was released from Rutledge 's Insane Asylum and into the care of a psychiatrist at a group home for orphaned children in Victorian-era London , which is where the sequel , Alice : Madness Returns , begins . Now eleven years on , Alice , who had been living a life of relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the death of her parents , deemed to have been begun by a clumsy cat in the first game . As Alice 's sanity begins to crumble she dives back down the rabbit hole once more to discover the truth and fix her broken mind . The world of Wonderland , now more warped and deranged than ever , calls for a more violent approach from Alice , which in turn requires bigger and better weapons and brand new abilities . Being a story-led game that dazzles with its madness , we wo n't spoil the game 's surprises , or even the tools that it gives you , but needless to say , they 're all a bit bizarre . Graphically , Alice uses Epic 's Unreal Engine 3 , and as such is on par with other recent titles , but if you have a PhysX-compatible graphics card you 'll be able to experience a huge variety of extra , immersion-adding effects . From realistically floating bubbles in the background , to accurately falling leaves , there are a range of subtle effects that greatly enhance Wonderland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to enhance nearly every aspect of Alice Madness : Returns . Weapons gain extra particle effects , making them feel ' beefier , and in the case of Alice 's heavy melee weapon , the environment is realistically deformed and destroyed with each impact , whereas with PhysX off there is no visible change whatsoever . Enemies on death coat the environs with particles and their remains , and one of Alice 's most common enemies deposits black goop on the ground when hit , which Alice can then realistically run through and disperse .

@@20827460 @827460/ <h> Fallout 4 Graphics , Performance &amp; Tweaking Guide <p> In Fallout 4 there 's a massive new story to explore , along with the largest and most detailed world Bethesda Game Studios has ever constructed , plus new crafting mechanics , settlement construction , and a great deal more . <p> To unearth and detail every aspect of Fallout 4 's graphics technology , we 've invested over a hundred hours testing every single game setting , config file tweak , and console command to reveal their impact on image quality and their relative performance cost . Every setting and tweak of note is further detailed by our patented interactive comparisons , enabling you to instantly determine which settings you should and should not enable with a couple of mouse clicks . <p> So set aside some time and check out the info , images and videos below to see why you should play Fallout 4 on PC , and preferably with a GeForce GTX GPU . <p> Bethesda 's Fallout 4 system requirements reflect the game 's scalability , enabling you to reduce graphical detail to previous-generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current-generation consoles : <p> Neither of these previous-generation graphics cards are available to purchase , however , so if you 're looking to build a system for Fallout 4 today , or to upgrade an older rig , what GeForce GTX GPUs should you be targeting for High setting gameplay ? <p> Of these technologies , G-SYNC is particularly beneficial in Fallout 4 , delivering a smoother , more responsive experience thanks to innovations that changed the inner-workings of computer monitors . Learn the specifics of how G-SYNC can enhance your Fallout 4 experience on our G-SYNC technology page . <p> Regardless of your system configuration , all NVIDIA GPU users will automatically receive Optimal Playable Settings for Fallout 4 through GeForce Experience , and those with sufficiently-speedy , compatible GPUs will have NVIDIA Volumetric Lighting effects enabled in-game . With a single-click , Fallout 4 's 20 settings will be auto-configured for your system , with a target of 60 frames per second , delivering a responsive , smooth experience . <p> Fallout 4 's filled with settings . 20 in total , in fact . And within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliders with nearly two-dozen notches . We 've thoroughly examined each in countless locations and scenarios , grabbed examples of their impact on image quality , created interactive comparisons so you can easily observe the differences , and benchmarked their performance so you can see how much each costs when you turn it on or off , or alter the detail level . <p> Actor Fade <p> An " Actor " in Fallout 4 is an NPC , animal , or enemy . And " Fade " is Bethesda 's word for " view distance " . In other words , the distance at which NPCs , animals and enemies can be seen . With a bazillion notches on a setting 's slider you 've got plenty of control over the option , but given the necessity of finding characters or navigating around Legendary enemies , it 's a setting well worth having on half or higher . <p> As you can see from our screenshots it takes a good long while for characters to disappear from view , but at that point actors are no more than a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As such , you can safely turn the setting down a few notches without any real loss of fidelity . <p> Performance : As you 'd expect , there 's a progressive reduction in performance as the view distance of actors is increased . And as the more visible , nearer actors are rendered , the performance cost per detail level increases because the characters are larger and more detailed , requiring additional horsepower to render . <p> Note : the number of detail levels in each " Fade " setting changed during the course of our testing , raising from 15 to 21 . Having conducted some choice re-testing , our results show that the minimum and maximum frame rates remained the same , with merely some additional detail levels added in between to add even great configurability . <p> If you wish to tweak Actor Fade to increase the view distance of characters and enemies , check out our tweaking section . <p> Ambient Occlusion <p> Ambient Occlusion ( AO ) adds contact shadows where two surfaces or objects meet , and where objects block light from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the quality of the implementation affects the accuracy of AO shadows , and whether new shadows are formed when the level of occlusion is low . Without Ambient Occlusion , scenes appear flat and unrealistic , and objects float on surfaces . <p> In Fallout 4 we see Screen Space Ambient Occlusion ( SSAO ) employed , which adds a small amount of fidelity to scenes in most circumstances , and a moderate amount occasionally . And while far from the best technique available , SSAO is nonetheless a welcome addition ; without its inclusion image quality would be diminished as the following comparisons demonstrate . <p> Given the right conditions , AO can enhance Fallout . Here , the tire is grounded , the truck gains some very visible shadows , and other subtle improvements can be seen . <p> Indoor locations can benefit , too , though often to a lesser degree . In this scene we observe improvements around the pipes , primarily . <p> Ignoring the randomly-generated debris and grass , look to the distant buildings , which are apparently out of AO 's range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and truck . <p> Performance : For the most part , Ambient Occlusion 's impact on image quality is a subtle one , and though its implementation costs up to 7 frames per second it 's worth enabling on many a system given its extensive use throughout the game . <p> Anisotropic Filtering <p> As you 're likely aware , Texture Filtering , Anisotropic Filtering , and other similarly named options affect the sharpness of textures , especially those in the distance or on the sides of the screen . Without Anisotropic Filtering , surfaces lose definition , understandably degrading image quality . <p> In Fallout 4 , various levels of Anisotropic Filtering ( AF ) are available , with the top-end 16x variant doing an excellent job . <p> Performance : High-quality Anisotropic Filtering is a must in every game , and as is often the way it has a minimal performance cost , making its use suitable for every system . <p> Anti-Aliasing <p> Fallout 4 's new lighting system and upgraded engine mean a move away from MSAA hardware anti-aliasing options . In their place we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions similarly to our own TXAA , in that it tackles shimmering on anti-aliased edges whilst also reducing general aliasing . To demonstrate , here are 3 video clips ( right click , Save As ... ) showing Fallout 4 with anti-aliasing disabled , with standard post-process FXAA anti-aliasing enabled , and with TAA enabled . <p> In these high-quality , albeit compressed video clips , you can immediately see a significant improvement in image quality when TAA is enabled . And when moving your character the improvement is even more pronounced . True , the image is softer , but in every other regard it is dramatically better , and after an hour or so you 'll likely be used to the softness . <p> In addition to the advantages outlined above , TAA has a lesser impact on texture clarity than FXAA , as shown below . <p> There 's a stark difference in aliasing and texture clarity in static shots , but in-game you tend not to notice the loss of texture fidelity . You do appreciate the near-complete elimination of temporal aliasing , however . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and incidental details on surfaces . And with this setting you can adjust the maximum number that appear on surfaces and objects , and bodies . <p> Creating true comparisons is next to impossible because of the random nature of firefights , so please take us at our word when we say the difference between detail levels is slight , and in the majority of instances you 're primarily affecting the time old decals are visible because new decals are generated across an area during the course of a battle , rather than in one spot in front of your character . In other words , at higher detail levels old decals are more likely to still be rendered when you walk back across a scene after a firefight . <p> According to the game files , 1000 decals can be rendered simultaneously on objects and the environment on max settings , and a further 100 on actors , with a maximum of 40 per actor . This decreases to 100/35/20 on Medium , which is still a fair number given that only larger and more explosive weapons generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spatter is ever-so-subtle until you get up close after the fact for a spot of ol ' lootin ' . <p> Performance : In a specially concocted test that maximized the number of decals visible in one area , the performance impact was up to 15 frames per second . During general gameplay , however , the number is more like 5 frames per second at the very most . <p> With 250 , 50 and 40 decals , respectively , High offers a good balance between performance and detail , generating more than enough decals during most engagements . If you feel you require more decals than Ultra offers , manually tweak the maximum values . <p> Depth of Field <p> For dialog , VATS combat , and other select scenes , Fallout 4 employs Depth of Field blurring to emphasize action , characters , and certain game elements . Players can chose between a basic depth of field blur , or a more advanced Bokeh implementation that can apply custom shapes to blurred game elements for a stylized cinematic presentation . <p> In practice , the most visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Bokeh shapes being briefly seen during VATS action-cam shots . <p> Please note : HUD glitches are a result of switching between settings in-game using the command console , which was required to create our comparisons . <p> Performance : During dialog Depth of Field helps focus the camera and your attention on the conversation , which is certainly nice to have , but far from essential . During combat a wider blur is applied ; personal preference will dictate whether you like or dislike it . <p> At 5 frames per second for the higher-quality Bokeh effect , during moments of gameplay where twitch reactions and blistering framerates are n't required , you have little to lose in giving Depth of Field a shot . <p> Distant Object Detail <p> Distant Object Detail controls the quality of buildings , pylons , highways and other predominantly large objects , and the visibility of these and other game elements in the far distance . <p> As you can see , the fidelity and visibility of the aforementioned game elements gradually decreases as the detail level is lowered , before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Performance : As the majority of the game detail affected by the setting is already of a comparatively low quality , the adjustment of Distant Object Detail has a minor impact on performance , even when great swathes of detail are removed . <p> If you 're truly struggling for performance , the extra 4 frames per second afforded by Low may help , but for the majority of systems Medium should be the lowest level selected to avoid complete removal of detail . <p> For Fallout 4 , we 've worked hand-in-hand with Bethesda to introduce NVIDIA Volumetric Lighting on PC and consoles . Visible in almost all promotional screenshots and videos , right from the moment of the game 's announcement at E3 2015 , NVIDIA Volumetric Lighting is key to achieving Fallout 4 's unique look , and its spectacular lighting effects . <p> Generally , when folks refer to Volumetric Lighting they mean God Rays , Light Shafts , or Light Rays , but in the case of Fallout 4 NVIDIA Volumetric Lighting is so much more , reflecting light and adding illumination , shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exemplified by the interactive comparisons presented on this page . <p> The key advantage of NVIDIA Volumetric Lighting , and the reason it 's so pervasive throughout Fallout 4 , is that it is constructed using tessellation rather than post process effects . With GPU-accelerated tessellation , Volumetric Lighting is truly dynamic , enabling it to be seen from any angle or view point , and from behind objects that occlude the casting light source . Using post-process effects , God Rays are visible solely when looking at their point of origin , and can not enhance the entire world , as is the case in Fallout 4 . <p> In addition , NVIDIA Volumetric Lighting effects are affected by weather conditions , the dynamic day-night cycle , visual effects , and other factors , giving the world a truly dynamic appearance . <p> On PC , NVIDIA Volumetric Lighting effects can be rendered at a significantly higher detail level , improving the visibility and separation of light shafts , the number of light shafts rendered , the intensity of the light shafts , the general fidelity of the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And furthermore , their fidelity scales with resolution , giving gamers with 4K displays or NVIDIA Dynamic Super Resolution activated an even greater level of detail . <p> Note how the building shadows are accentuated by the Volumetric Lighting , and how the lighting is itself shadowed , an impossible feat with post-process effects . <p> With NVIDIA Volumetric Lighting enabled the overwhelming majority of scenes are transformed into dynamic environments filled with light and shadow , and a level of detail that would be otherwise impossible to feature in an expansive game like Fallout 4 , where players can go anywhere and approach objectives from multiple angles ( post-process volumetric lighting is hand-placed and is generally visible from a single angle or direction ) . <p> In screenshots you do n't get the complete picture , however : in-game , decreasing the quality level introduces temporal flickering that can occasionally be observed when God Rays shift with a time of day change , or when viewed through moving objects , such as trees blowing in the wind . Furthermore , blurring can be seen around gun sights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison , check out this Ultra-quality video , and compare against this Low-quality clip . Note how the God Rays flicker and dance around the screen as the swaying branches intersect with the light shafts , and how foliage ( transparencies ) that are struck by the Low-quality God Rays are blurred . <p> By raising the tessellation level applied to the God Rays , and by keeping their rendering at half-resolution rather than quarter-resolution , these artifacts are avoided , creating a consistent high-quality appearance throughout Fallout 4 . <p> Performance : The way Fallout 4 was meant to be played was with NVIDIA Volumetric Lighting effects enabled , but this being a PC game you can turn it off if you really wish , or if you 're in desperate need of performance . <p> At its lowest level of detail , which still looks extremely impressive , the God Rays setting costs 6.5 frames per second in a graphically intensive benchmark . With the significant image quality enhancement that it applies , transforming almost every outdoor scene throughout the entire game , a mere 6.5 frames is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For greater control over the setting 's detail levels , and to increase image quality even further , check out the tweaking section . <p> Grass Fade <p> If you wish to adjust the visibility of grass , this is your go-to setting . With many notches on its configuration slider , the view distance of grass can be fine-tuned to your liking . <p> As with other similar settings there 's a gradual increase in the visibility of grass as the detail level is raised , helping cover the terrain when viewing from an elevated position . From ground-level , the difference is typically much less pronounced as other pieces of foliage are unaffected by the setting and remain visible regardless of the selected option . <p> Performance : As observed when testing Actor Fade earlier , the increase or decrease of the Grass Fade detail level has a small impact on performance at each step , with the highest detail levels having a minimal extra cost due to the small size of the most-distant tufts of extra grass . <p> Fallout 4 defines an item as anything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to bags of cement and bones . And as you 've likely guessed already , the Item Fade setting adjusts the view distance of these game elements . To demonstrate , here 's a contrived scenario featuring a thousand or so buckets . <p> In reality , the density and placement of items is far sparser , and the majority of items are significantly smaller and less visible , resulting in only a minor loss of fidelity when Item Fade is dialed down to half . Beneath the midway mark on the setting 's slider , items visibly pop into view , so we 'd recommend going no lower unless you 're in desperate need of performance . <p> Performance : Again we see minor changes in performance at each detail level , though in this case the deltas are even smaller as items are n't visible throughout the entirety of a scene , like grass or city buildings are . <p> Discover how to further increase the visibility of items in our tweaking section . <p> Lens Flare <p> A fond favorite of J.J. Abrams , Lens Flare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of a bright light . In the context of Fallout 4 , lens flares are an occasional sight that add variety and style to bombed out buildings and illuminated areas . <p> Performance : Being a post-process effect , Lens Flares cost less than a frame per second , making them an inexpensive way to increase image quality on all but the slowest systems . <p> Lighting Quality <p> In many games a ' Lighting Quality ' setting adjusts the fidelity of lighting , the quality of shaders , and perhaps the quality of light-material interaction . In Fallout 4 , High ever-so-slightly improves skybox and world lighting in very select circumstances , and Ultra enables subtle Subsurface Scattering ( SSS ) on actors . <p> With your microscope you may be able to observe the subtle improvement in lighting in this scene , visible on the upper left on the skybox . <p> To accurately render skin in games , additional techniques and technologies are required . In real and virtual worlds light bounces from most objects and surfaces , which we can accurately and easily render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking skin is absorbed and diffused , with some rays being emitted , though at a lower intensity . Without a suitable technology simulating this effect character skin is uniformly lit , detracting from the quality of the picture . <p> In Fallout 4 , the impact of the effect is subtle , and only truly observable during dialog when characters and the action are static , and the camera 's close to an actor 's face . <p> Performance : The marginally improved lighting enabled by High costs just a couple of frames per second , and Subsurface Scattering another frame per second . <p> With such a low cost you may as well enable them both , but if you 're in need of performance you can safely turn them off without appreciably degrading image quality . <p> Object Fade <p> Fallout 4 's objects are those larger items you ca n't pilfer , along with air conditioning units , post boxes , garden furniture , fences , cars , trucks , trees , and much , much more . As you 'll see below , the quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed on the lowest detail levels , diminishing image quality quite considerably . <p> In our second set of images and comparisons you 'll also note the removal of certain shadows as the detail level is decreased , in addition to the removal of collapsed highways , details on roads , and rubble around objects . <p> To extend the draw distance of objects there 's a simple tweak detailed later in this guide . <p> Performance : Like the other Fade settings , the mid-point offers a good balance between image quality and performance , and keeps pop-in to a minimum on ground-level , where you 'll spend the vast majority of your time . <p> In our Grass Fade scene , cracks in the road and minute foliage details were removed half way down the slider , followed by cones , traffic signs and rock details at three-quarters down . Just before minimum we lost the vehicles , sand bags , and smaller details . And finally , on minimum , rocks , trees , buildings , and their shadows were removed . This was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly higher performance cost than the majority of other areas . <p> Object Detail Fade <p> Object Detail Fade has a very , very , very minor impact on the fidelity of objects rendered by Object Fade . Most commonly this occurs at long range , making the differences between detail levels nigh on impossible to note during gameplay , or even in comparison screenshots without 500% enlargements . <p> Performance : Unsurprisingly , the near-indistinguishable image quality adjustments have next to no impact on performance , with only a 1.6 FPS delta between minimum and maximum detail levels . <p> Rain Occlusion <p> With this setting enabled , rain wo n't be rendered around your character if you 're beneath an elevated highway or in a dilapidated building , and rain drops and splashes wo n't be rendered on the floor . <p> Performance : As the game has to calculate occlusion and track the player 's position to ensure accurate rendering , this setting costs a few frames per second during storms . <p> Screen Space Reflections <p> Given the right conditions , and a suitably reflective surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adding an extra level of detail in certain scenes . For the most part , you 'll find these reflections on nearby bodies of water ( water reflections are n't rendered beyond a fixed distance ) , though there are a few other locations and surface types that benefit from the feature . <p> Out in the open world , water reflections are often subtle . <p> Other reflections in the world come courtesy of inexpensive , pre-baked , faked , static cube maps , and can be most readily seen on the surface of your shiny robo-butler at the start of the game . <p> Performance : Fallout 4 's reflections typically cost around 4-5 frames per second , raising to at most 9 frames per second in the most detailed locations . <p> With their added detail Screen Space Reflections are certainly nice to have , but are by no means essential for those in search of performance . <p> If you wish to adjust the look of Screen Space Reflections , you can learn how in the tweaking section . <p> Shadow Distance <p> Shadow Distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some much-needed depth to distant detail . The trade-off is a reduction in the detail of shadows as the setting is raised , as you can see in our images and comparisons below . <p> The slight loss of shadow fidelity seen on Ultra can be counteracted by tweaking the Shadow Quality , though this does reduce performance that bit further . If you instead prefer to run an all-stock experience you 'll need to chose between increased shadow draw distance , or higher-quality mid-to-long range shadows . <p> Performance : Enabling some degree of shadowing costs around 8 frames per second , and stepping up to Ultra Shadow Distance costs a further 2.7 frames per second . Given that shadows are essential , you 'll be wanting to use at least High . <p> Shadow Quality <p> Another self-explanatory setting , Shadow Quality adjusts the visibility , detail level , and fidelity of shadows throughout the game , making it one of the most important settings for those seeking a good-to-excellent level of image quality . <p> Interestingly , Medium offers a better experience than High in certain circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in barely-visible shadows , as you can see under the car in our first set of screens . <p> Performance : Maximum quality shadows cost over 20 frames per second , which is well worth the increase in fidelity in every single scene for the duration of your time with Fallout 4 , in our opinion . If 20 FPS is a step too far for your system , High-quality shadows are around 10 frames per second cheaper , and Medium 13 cheaper . <p> According to Fallout 4 's config file only iTexMipMapSkip= changes between detail levels , which has no visible impact on textures outside of a few locations , and even then the difference in image quality is near-imperceptible . <p> Visible differences between detail levels in this comparison are a result of the game 's randomly generated grass , debris and puddle system , along with persistent tree and foliage sway , even when the game is frozen using console commands . <p> Fallout 4 's system requirements call for 3GB of VRAM for 1920x1080 Ultra textures , though in our testing usage only came close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 3GB you 'll of course want to use Ultra to maximize texture detail , but as we 've demonstrated even the lowest detail appears identical to Ultra ( in our pre-release Press build ) , so give Ultra a shot regardless of your system configuration and see how you fare . <p> Performance : As is the case in almost all games , adjusting texture detail has no perceptible impact on performance . <p> Wetness <p> Fallout 4 's final setting makes surfaces appear wet when it rains . Moreover , it adds shine to illuminated surfaces and character clothing , and generally improves image quality by a significant degree . <p> Performance : As shown above , the world looks flat and far less interesting with Wetness disabled , making the setting worthwhile for those occasions that it rains . <p> Game Setting Conclusion <p> With 20 settings , and dozens of detail levels , it can be tricky to determine what you should and should not enable if your system ca n't max out every option . If it were us , we 'd enable settings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance between image quality and performance : <p> Texture Quality ( Ultra ) <p> Anisotropic Filtering ( 16x ) <p> Anti-Aliasing ( TAA ) <p> Shadow Distance ( High ) <p> Shadow Quality ( High ) <p> God Rays Quality ( Low ) <p> Object Fade ( 50% ) <p> Distant Object Detail ( High ) <p> Actor Fade ( 50% ) <p> Item Fade ( 50% ) <p> Grass Fade ( 50-75% ) <p> Wetness ( On ) <p> Ambient Occlusion ( On ) <p> Screen Space Reflections ( On ) <p> Lens Flare ( On ) <p> Depth of Field ( Standard ) <p> Object Detail Fade ( any ) <p> Lighting Quality ( Medium ) <p> Rain Occlusion ( On ) <p> Decal Quantity ( High ) <p> If you think we 're on the right track , you can let GeForce Experience auto-configure your settings with a single click . <p> With an accessible configuration file there 's plenty of opportunity to tweak Fallout 4 's settings , pushing them beyond their defined maximum values to further increase image quality , assuming you have the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the launcher to your liking , then exit out . Head to C : UsersUSERNAMEDocumentsMy GamesFallout4 and backup Fallout4Prefs.ini . Open Fallout4Prefs.ini with a text editor , such as Notepad++ , and edit one or more of the values described below . Save your modified file and reload the launcher , but this time simply press " Play " and do not re-enter the options portion of the tool , otherwise your changes may be overridden . <p> Actor Fade Tweak <p> Earlier we detailed the negligible improvement to image quality when utilizing the highest levels of the Actor Fade setting , due to the now-visible characters being only a few pixels in size as they are located some distance from the player . The one upside is the near-complete removal of fade-in and pop-in of these actors , but given the number of objects strewn about the world , and the undulating terrain , opportunities to see the full benefit of the setting are few and far between . <p> Nevertheless , if you wish to further increase the view distance of actors , modify fLODFadeOutMultActors= Ultra-detail value : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quantity enabled we 've yet to encounter a situation where the setting needed to be raised . But higher it can go by modifying the following values : <p> The first tweak of note in Fallout 4 enables you to increase the view distance , visibility , and quality of distant objects . With a few values doubled you 'll see trees on distant hills , distant pylons , distant buildings , a higher level of detail on select game elements , and more detailed terrain . <p> Caveat : some objects in the foreground may be negatively affected . As you can see in our comparison , the large white building regressed in quality , but this is the first and only time we saw that occur . If you 're still happy to proceed , here are the values you need to change : <p> Our verdict : a must have , assuming there are no further graphical anomalies . <p> Godrays Quality Tweaks <p> The presets for our Volumetric Lighting effects balance image quality and performance to enable a wide array of systems to enable the transformative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilde , the key left of " 1 " on most English-language keyboards , you can adjust the parameters of the setting to increase or decrease image quality and performance . <p> GR scale number : adjust the intensity of the light source and increase the size of God Rays and light volumes . Recommended only for screenshot taking <p> GR fog 0/1 : enables and disables fog <p> GR fogcolor r g b : adjusts the fog absorption color , which affects scattering . Can be set to any RGB value <p> GR info : displays the current God Ray settings <p> The above options are useful for those examining Godrays Quality in closer detail , or wanting to test performance . GR grid , in contrast , enables actual tweaking of the setting 's image quality and performance . <p> At its most basic , GR grid can be thought of as a way to improve the quality of existing God Rays and add additional rays , and vice versa . The default value is 64 , and by increasing the value the quality of Volumetric Lighting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement , tweaking can decrease the visibility of flickering that is occasionally observed when God Rays shift with a time of day change , or when viewed through moving objects , as we detailed earlier . <p> To demonstrate the tweak 's impact in still screenshots , here are a new set of interactive comparisons : <p> These wireframe comparisons show the ever-improving quality applied by GR grid , but as you can see in the Volumetric Lighting-only images below that improvement does n't translate to an observable improvement beyond 256 . <p> Performance : Tweaking down to 32 increases your performance by a few frames , and tweaking up to 128 decreases performance slightly . Beyond 128 , performance rapidly plunges : <p> 32 really is n't recommended due to the increase in flickering . If you 're struggling for performance , instead select a lower-quality preset and then try increasing GR grid to counteract the loss of image quality . This may result in a superior experience . <p> For those with performance to spare , increase GR grid to 128 . If there 's still spare performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Grass Fade Tweak <p> In Bethesda 's games , adding extra grass to the terrain in the distance improved image quality considerably as rural landscapes lack cities , clutter , and man-made objects . In Fallout 4 there are buildings , objects galore , trees , and pieces of foliage unaffected by the Grass Fade setting , creating a varied urban and semi-rural landscape that does n't rely solely on grass for variety and detail . Nevertheless , those seeking the definitive level of image quality can increase grass rendering distance . <p> The maximum value that bestows any benefit is 14000 , unless you tweak the uGrids value , which we 'll get to later , to add additional full-detail gameplay cells . If you do tweak uGrids , you can increase the value to 28000 to blanket every millimeter of suitable terrain with grass . <p> Performance : Adding some extra grass does n't cost all that much . uGrids in this scenario , however ... <p> Item Fade Tweak <p> As was the case with Actor Fade , there 's little benefit to tweaking Item Fade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bucket looks like a silver pixel at 200 meters , for instance ) . <p> As objects run the gamut from houses to cars , to vending machines and fences , tweaking Object Fade beyond the in-game maximum can increase detail on distant views if you tweak uGrids . Depending on the scene you may see additional vehicles , or only a trash can that looks like a dot at distance . Your mileage may very , in other words . <p> For the tweak to kick-in , change fLODFadeOutMultObjects= Ultra value : 15 . And check out our tweaking summary to see the minor improvement in a max-setting scenario . <p> Particle Tweaks <p> Particles form the basis of many weapon effects , and other visual effects such as explosions , smoke , and fire . To adjust the maximum number that can be rendered simultaneously , tweak =iMaxDesired Ultra value : 750 . <p> We 've yet to observe any benefit to raising the setting , but one likely exists , or will exist when modders create massive battles as they did in previous Bethesda games . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accessible with the tilde key ( ) , left of " 1 " on most keyboards , you can adjust a number of Screen Space Reflection ( SSR ) parameters to modify their appearance : <p> Once you 've settled on a combination of settings that you like , take a note and add them to a text ( . txt ) file , with one command on each line . Place the file in your game install directory where the Fallout4.exe is located , and when you 're next in-game type bat filename to execute the changes . <p> Shadow Distance Tweak <p> Earlier , we explained that as Shadow Distance increases the fidelity and detail level of shadows decreases . The maximum values set by the game launcher are **26;720;TOOLONG and **29;748;TOOLONG , and on High the value is reduced to 14000 . <p> At 20000 shadows begin to lose definition , and at 14000 a few too many distance shadows are removed . Instead , we 'd recommend you tweak the value to 17000 for a better balance between distance and detail during general gameplay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparisons below , some distant shadows are visibly removed , but during ground-level gameplay the improvement to image quality from 17000 is appreciable . <p> Note how 30000 and 40000 add a nice fat shadow around the highway , at the expense of shadow definition just about everywhere else . <p> Shadow Quality Tweak <p> To give shadow quality a big boost , and increase the visibility and fidelity of distant shadows , increase iShadowMapResolution= from 4096 to 8192 . <p> Some nearby shadows are unnaturally sharp , but given the general screen-wide increase to image quality it 's a minor quibble . <p> Performance : Shadow Quality is one of the most expensive Fallout 4 settings , and doubling its detail level once more understandably impacts performance by a fair margin . <p> uGrids Tweak <p> In Skyrim , when you looked across a vista or down on a city from an elevated position you could see for miles and miles , albeit with a variable level of detail . If everything in the visible area were loaded at full quality the vast majority of systems would be unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash . To limit what could and could not be shown , the game world was broken into squares ( uGrids ) , and around the player 5 full-detail uGrids were loaded simultaneously . <p> With tweaking we could increase the number of uGrids loaded , but as Skyrim was a 32-bit . exe , and most GPUs had at max 2GB of VRAM , performance and stability was poor above 7 uGrids as players frequently ran out of RAM , VRAM , and general CPU and GPU horsepower . <p> For Fallout 4 , the game engine has received a 64-bit upgrade , solving RAM issues ; GPUs now have significantly more VRAM , and 2015 hardware is leagues ahead of what we had back in 2011 . In other words , uGrids are now legitimately usable , and stable , all the way up to and including uGrids 13 , improving image quality and detail draw distances substantially . Take a look at the comparisons below to see what we mean . <p> And combined with the Grass Fade tweak , grass view distance and general image quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sprint off to change uGridsToLoad= , please note that uGrids can alter your game and save data , and reverting to a previous uGrids value at a later date may break your save . Mods like Stable uGridsToLoad were eventually developed for Skyrim to workaround these issues , and before that we had this manual fix , which appears to also work in Fallout 4 : <p> Start Fallout 4 and load up a saved game <p> Use ALT+TAB to switch out of Fallout 4 and back to your Desktop <p> Edit the Fallout4Prefs.ini file as normal , modifying the uGridsToLoad variable to the desired lower value . Save Fallout4Prefs.ini and close it <p> Use ALT+TAB to switch back to Fallout 4 <p> Open the Command Console using the tilde ( ) key and type refreshini <p> Save your game to a new save slot , and it should now have the correct new uGridsToLoad value <p> If you 're concerned about breaking your game and losing progress simply wait for a foolproof mod or script , as was developed for Skyrim . If however you like to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files and enjoy the massively improved image quality . <p> Performance : Loading extra uGrids adds additional high-quality detail across your field of view , and so has a sizable performance impact . It also requires vast amounts of RAM and VRAM - our tests frequently saw 6GB of RAM and VRAM in use at 1920x1080 , with uGrids maxed out at 13 . <p> If you have performance to spare , and the requisite hardware , tweaking uGrids will have the single largest impact on image quality of any Fallout 4 tweak or game setting . <p> Water Tweaks <p> You ca n't increase the quality of water in Fallout 4 , which appears to have three set-in-stone LoD levels , but you can turn off several of its features to improve performance on slower systems . To do so , simply change " 1 " to " 0 " on the following config file lines : <p> To increase the quality of your graphics even further , activate Dynamic Super Resolution ( DSR ) to receive up to 4K-quality graphics on your HD monitor . How it works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are rendered at a higher , more detailed resolution , and the image intelligently shrunk back down to the resolution of your monitor using a custom-made filter , giving you up to 4K-quality graphics on your screen . The video below explains more , and the images show how to activate the setting in the NVIDIA Control Panel . <p> With DSR enabled , textures benefit from improved clarity , aliasing is almost entirely eliminated , objects have better definition , vegetation is more detailed , and distant game elements are significantly clearer . If you 've used DSR in other games you 'll know of these benefits already , but if you have n't had the chance here 's a look at how Fallout 4 's graphics scale with rendering resolutions . <p> Even though DSR is of great benefit , in the case of Fallout 4 we 'd recommend tweaking uGrids first as it adds actual detail , rather than ' simply ' improving what 's currently visible . If after tweaking uGrids you have performance to spare , increase your rendering resolution with DSR for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reference GeForce GTX 980 Ti , we increased the DSR rendering resolution in our demanding benchmark that incorporates almost all of Fallout 4 's graphics settings , demonstrating the most demanding moments of this enormous game . <p> Overclocking <p> If you need extra performance , overclocking your CPU and GPU will pay dividends in Fallout 4 demanding open world . Learn how with the help of GeForce Garage . <p> Tweaking Wrap-Up <p> Above we 've documented what we believe to be the most useful of tweaks . Many old favorites from Skyrim no longer work , numerous lines in the configuration file have no noticeable or positive impact on image quality , and of the hundreds of in-game console commands we 're expecting the majority to be locked down in the retail release of the game . Those that remain will undoubtedly be tested by experienced Skryim modders , and should they find anything of note we 'll be sure to update the guide . <p> Using the tweaks we have verified so far , we 've already gained a considerable amount of detail as the interactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are visible on distant buildings , trees are rendered on the distant hill , which is now of a higher quality ; a turret can be seen across the river , a character can be seen on the river boat , and everything just looks better . <p> Performance is unplayable with every single thing maxed out , as was the case when Skyrim first launched , but in time hardware will improve and many more will have the opportunity to take advantage of these tweaks and the graphics mods that will undoubtedly be developed . In the meantime , we 'd recommend starting with uGrids 7 ( if you 're unafraid of potential issues ) , Shadow Quality , Distant Object Detail , and Grass Fade , in that order . <p> If you learn of any other beneficial tweaks , be sure to let us know via the comments section . <p> G-SYNC : Eliminating Stutters &amp; Tearing For The Ultimate Experience <p> NVIDIA revolutionized computer displays in 2013 with the introduction of variable refresh rates , enabling gamers to enjoy highly responsive , tear-free , stutter-free experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere agree that it 's painful to play on anything other than a G-SYNC display once you 're used to the flawless experience it provides . <p> With a G-SYNC monitor you explore the wasteland in optical bliss for hundreds of hours , without encountering any of the issues associated with old monitor technology , leaving you to worry only about the enemies and hazards in-game . <p> Game Ready Fallout 4 Driver <p> For the best Fallout 4 experience we recommend updating to the new Fallout 4 GeForce Game Ready Drivers .

@@20827469 @827469/ <h> Architecture <h> The Fermi Architecture <p> The GeForce GTX 400/500 family of GPUs is based on NVIDIA 's Fermi architecture " the most significant leap in GPU architecture since theoriginal G80 . G80 was our initial vision of what a unified graphics and compute processor should look like . GT200 extended the performance and functionality of G80 . With Fermi , we have taken all we have learned from the two prior processors , analyzed the various applicationsthat were written for them , and developed a completely new architecture optimized for next generation games and applications . <h> Parallel Tessellation Engines <p> Traditional GPU designs use a single geometry engine to perform tessellation . This approach is analogous to early GPU designs which used a single pixel pipeline to perform pixel shading . Having observed how pixel pipelines grew from a single unit to many parallel units and its subsequent impact on 3D realism , we designed our tessellation architecture to be parallel from day one . <p> Fermi GPUs implement up to sixteen parallel tessellation units , each with its own dedicated shading resources . Up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine stream of pixels for shading . The close coupling for tessellation , rasterization , and shading units provides enormous on-chip bandwidth and high execution efficiency . The result is a breakthrough in tessellation performance at up to two billion triangles per second . Compared to competing products , Fermi GPUs are up to 8x faster as measured by independent reviews using Microsoft 's DirectX 11 software development kit . <h> Third Generation Streaming Multiprocessor <p> Fermi 's third generation Streaming Multiprocessor ( SM ) introduces several architectural innovations that improve both the performance and accurancy of complex graphics and compute work loads . <p> Each of Fermi 's SMs contains 32 CUDA processors " a fourfold increase over prior SM designs . By employing a flexible scalar architecture , CUDA cores achieve full performance on a variety of workloads such as textures , shadow maps , and complex shaders . The result is consistently high performance in current as well as future games . <p> Each CUDA processor has a fully pipelined integer arithmetic logic unit ( ALU ) and floating point unit ( FPU ) . The FPU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same standard used by the world 's premier computer scientists and research institutions . Fermi applies this high standard of precision for all workloads , be it in games , video transcoding , or desktop applications . <p> Fermi 's third generation SM also improves execution efficiency through improved scheduling . The SM schedules work in groups of 32 threads called warps . Each SM features two warp schedulers and two instruction dispatch units , allowing two warps to be issued and executed concurrently " twice over the prior generation . Because warps execute independently , Fermi 's scheduler does not need to check for dependencies from within the instruction stream . Using this elegant model of dual-issue , Fermi achieves great performance efficiency with minimal hardware . <h> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> - <h> New Cache Architecture <p> Fermi is the first GPU architecture with fully cached memory access . Caches have long been used in CPUs to improve memory access performance . With Fermi , we 've built a unified cache architecture that extends the benefit of caching to all graphics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture cache , an L1 cache , and an L2 cache . The L1 and L2 caches improve performance for programs with random memory access patterns such as raytracing and physics . The texture cache enables fast and efficient texture filtering .

With the title being a sequel to 1996 fan-favorite Duke Nukem 3D , the game has some big shoes to fill . Developing the game is Gearbox Software , makers of the critically-acclaimed " Borderlands . " Even though shooters have certainly become much more complicated since 1996 , Duke Nukem Forever takes the genre back to its fun and simple roots . Do n't expect numerous dialogue trees or a multitude of screen menus to sift through here . Gearbox just wants to deliver the crude fun fans know and love with updated , modern graphics . Heightening these visuals is NVIDIA 3D Vision support . Like the original game , aliens have invaded earth .

Even though the numerous ways to creatively obliterate enemies will keep you entertained , saving the world can sometimes be tiring . Fortunately , Duke Nukem Forever features several mini-games which help players kick back and relax . Duke can shoot hoops , play air hockey , pool , slots , and even pump iron . But ultimately , it would n't be a Duke game if it did n't include crude and vulgar humor .

As a result , they took GPU Boost technology and developed GPU Boost 2.0 for GTX 700 and GTX 700M Series GPUs , which increases the Boost Clock until the GPU hits a predetermined Temperature Target . With this change , performance is increased by 3-7% over GPU Boost 1.0 at stock speeds , and by a larger degree on factory-overclocked models sold by our partners . <h> More Control , Less Noise <p> GPU Boost 2.0 also offers improved user-control for desktop GeForce GTX GPUs , who can tweak the Boost behavior by increasing or decreasing the Temperature Target with third-party software . This let 's desktop GeForce GTX over-clockers decrease the maximum temperature , speed , and noise output of a GPU when working or playing older games , and to ramp everything up to max when playing the likes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperatures become irrelevant , allowing GPU Boost to maximize voltage and power usage , in turn cranking the Boost Clock way beyond the norm , wringing every last drop of performance from your desktop 's GeForce GTX graphics card . <h> GeForce Notebooks get Boosted <p> GPU Boost 2.0 has been a standard feature on notebook GeForce GPUs since the 700M series .

@@20827486 @827486/ <h> Tom Clancy 's The Division Graphics &amp; Performance Guide <p> Tom Clancy 's The Division is one of the year 's most anticipated games , and it 's now live on PC . Inside you 'll find exclusive effects and features , more than 20 graphics settings with more than 90 options , support for higher rendering resolutions and uncapped framerates , and the inclusion of NVIDIA game-enhancing features such as DSR , G-SYNC , SLI , and Surround . <p> In this guide you 'll learn about each feature , effect and enhancement as we examine The Division 's many settings and PC-only upgrades . And we 'll also show you comparisons highlighting their benefits , as well as revealing their relative performance costs at 1920x1080 , the most popular PC gaming resolution . <p> This being the PC , you can of course crank many of the settings to Ultra , bolstering graphical fidelity further still . To discover the system you 'll require for a maxed out experience , skip to our settings summary . <p> Ambient Occlusion ( AO ) adds contact shadows where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks light from reaching another nearby game element . The AO technique used and the quality of the implementation affects the shadowing 's accuracy , and whether new shadows are formed when the level of occlusion is low . Without Ambient Occlusion scenes look flat and unrealistic , and objects appear as if they are floating . <p> In The Division , the Ambient Occlusion option enables players to choose between five increasingly-better versions of Massive Entertainment 's custom Ambient Occlusion technique , and our own HBAO+ effect . <p> As you can see in our interactive comparisons below HBAO+ delivers a much more accurate image compared to the Ultra option , which is especially evident in our AO-only captures . <p> With the Sun streaking across the statue , HBAO+ provides an accurate approximation of shadowing , and in the background emphasises that a sign was constructed of multiple slats , that a toppled street lamp 's shadow would be identical to the lamp itself . <p> As the interactive comparisons and screenshots demonstrate , HBAO+ greatly improves upon the other in-game options , enabling even the smallest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger , more graphically intensive areas the Low-Ultra options cost between 1 and 3 frames per second to enable at 1920x1080 , thanks to some nifty previous-frame reprojection and the use of Massive Entertainment 's always-on Temporal Anti-Aliasing ( more on that later ) . For consoles and low-power PCs , the efficient in-house Ambient Occlusion technique is an excellent option . For those with more power , HBAO+ delivers a richer , more realistic image , though understandably costs an additional 4.5 frames per second . <p> Anisotropic Filtering <p> Texture Filtering , Anisotropic Filtering , and other similarly named options affect the sharpness of textures , especially those seen in the distance , on oblique angles , or on the sides of the screen . Without Texture Filtering surfaces appear blurry , and image quality is significantly degraded . <p> In The Division players can choose between five Anisotropic detail levels , but really you should only pick 16X given the abundance of realistic surfaces that rely on Texture Filtering to avoid blurring . Note : Adjusting Anisotropic Filtering requires a client restart , and with the dynamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is next to impossible . Trust us though , 16X is what you want , as in every other game ever . <p> Performance : Anisotropic Filtering has a negligible performance cost on PC , with the delta being just 0.6 frames per second between 1x and 16x . <p> Chromatic Aberration <p> Chromatic Aberration is an age-old visual artifact associated with cheaper camera lenses and improperly taken photos . In recent years however , Chromatic Aberration has grown popular with game developers , much to the dismay of gamers who prefer cleaner images free of unsightly distortion . In the context of a photographer , or a security guard viewing the game world through a cheap camera , its use might make sense , but when playing in first or third person it merely suggests a trip to the optician is in order . <p> Thankfully , Massive Entertainment has made Chromatic Aberration an optional effect in The Division , ensuring a clean , clear image is obtainable . <p> When enabled , Chromatic Aberration distorts the picture slightly , but nowhere near the extent seen in other games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on screenshots , however , so we suggest you try it for yourself in-game . <p> Contact Shadows <p> If you 're reading this guide from top to bottom you may have noted that Ambient Occlusion already creates contact shadows , so why the need for a dedicated Contact Shadows setting ? The technical answer : Contact Shadows are created when rays of light from the Sun , Moon and Spotlights are occluded , whereas Ambient Occlusion shadows are created from Global Illumination ( bounced light ) , reflections , and lights that do n't cast shadows . <p> Simply put , the two settings deal with different things to create two separate sets of shadows that maximise image quality . <p> As the name suggests , these specialised shadows are formed at the point of contact between the occluder and the surface , grounding an occluder to prevent them from appearing as if they 're floating . This improves image quality and adds extra depth to scenes . <p> On offer are four options : Off , Sun Low , All Low , and All High . As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact shadows to occluders in the path of sunlight ( and moonlight , as the Moon takes the place of the Sun at night ) , while the two " All " settings also add contact shadows to occluders in the path of light cast by many of the game 's artificial light sources . <p> In our first set of interactive comparisons , note the debris between the two chairs , the shadows between the two stacked chairs , the counter and newspaper to the right , the straps to the left , the box in the foreground , and many of the other surfaces in the background . With Contact Shadows the scene gains additional depth , and in the case of the debris we can see that it is a model with height , in comparison to the cigarettes which are flat decals placed on the floor . <p> Turning the setting up the debris receives a more pronounced shadow , but otherwise the scene remains the same bar a few barely noticeable improvements . However , by enabling NVIDIA HFTS in concert with " All High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it 's nearly perfect , as exemplified by the interactive comparison below : <p> At night , powered-portions of the city are illuminated by artificial lights , enabling us to fully demonstrate the impact of the four detail levels in the Contact Shadow setting . <p> With " All High " note the improved shadowing on the layers of cardboard , around the trash bags , around the debris , and on the chain . And when looking at " Sun Low " , observe the subtle shadowing from the moonlight around many pieces of debris and the trash bags . <p> Performance : The cost of Contact Shadows varies from location to location and with the width and depth of the scene you 're viewing , and whether you 're using HFTS or PCSS . Using High Shadow Quality we observe a 0.6 FPS cost for enabling " Sun Low " , a 2.9 FPS cost for enabling " All Low " , and a 6.5 FPS cost for enabling " All High " . Switching to HFTS or PCSS , however , sees the cost per level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FPS when enabling " All High " . <p> Contact Shadows look great in screenshots , but in-game you 're often going to fail to notice their often-subtle improvements . Therefore , if you need extra performance consider dialing the setting back to " All Low " or " Sun Low " . And if you 're truly struggling for performance switch them completely off . <p> Depth of Field <p> The Division 's Depth of Field setting primarily adds out of focus blurring and diamond-shaped Bokeh effects to cutscenes and the wrist-mounted menu system characters use . <p> On Medium , Depth of Field is rendered at quarter-resolution , and on High at full resolution , though the difference in the menu system is impossible to detect during gameplay . <p> Performance : During gameplay , Medium is the recommended setting for most players given the cost of High . <p> Enable Wind-Affected Snow <p> Contrary to the setting 's naming wind and snow are always enabled , and snow is always blown by the wind , even if " Enable Wind-Affected Snow " is disabled . What it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles flow and wrap around buildings , instead of carrying straight on down the street . <p> Performance : " Enable Wind-Affected Snow " is a subtle effect and not something you can demonstrate in comparison screenshots . And as snow particles do n't follow a set pattern it 's also a tough proposition to demonstrate in a brief comparison video or GIF . So when you 're next in-game take a moment to watch the snow on the corner of a street , and you 'll eventually notice the effect . If you 're nonplussed about it , disable the option and regain 1 frame per second . <p> Extra Streaming Distance <p> " Extra Streaming Distance " functions similarly to a View Distance setting , adjusting the amount of detail that is rendered in the distance , and the quality of the detail that is presently shown . With a higher value selected more ' stuff ' will be rendered in the distance , distant detail will be rendered at a higher quality , and there 'll be less pop-in as you run through the environment , increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rendered regardless of your setting , though their fidelity will sometimes be reduced if you dial " Extra Streaming Distance " right back . <p> Performance : " Extra Streaming Distance " has a moderate impact on performance , costing up to 6.7 frames per second in gameplay scenarios , though it may have a greater cost for you if you have a slower CPU given the relatively high CPU impact of the setting . To determine if you 're hitting the limits of your CPU , you can download MSI Afterburner and monitor CPU utilization with the in-game overlay . If you do hit the limits , consider turning down " Extra Streaming Distance " and " Object Detail " . <p> Similarly , if you hit the limits of your GPU 's memory ( VRAM ) , or encountering any pauses while VRAM is cleared for new data , you may wish to dial the setting back as it is one of the more memory-hungry settings in The Division . <p> During gameplay " Extra Streaming Distance " is important for long-range detail , but more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other effects and options can have on performance ( they 're drawn or not drawn depending on your view distance ) , some fiddling may be required to get the perfect balance between performance and image quality on your machine . <p> Contributing directly to the performance impact of " Extra Streaming Distance " , in every scene , is the " Object Detail " setting , which adjusts the detail level of select objects being streamed in . Head on over to the " Object Detail " section to learn more . <p> Lens Flare <p> With the power out in much of The Division 's New York , backup floodlights and spotlights are employed to illuminate areas , generating plenty of lens flares . <p> Brightly lit interiors and exteriors , as well as fires , visual effects , and the Sun can cast additional lens flares in the right conditions . <p> If you 're in need of extra performance consider disabling Lens Flare as it is by no means crucial to achieving a high level of overall image quality . <p> Local Reflection Quality <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces that reflect local characters , lights , objects , and scenery , substantially improving image quality throughout the game . Five detail levels enable you to adjust the quality of these reflections , or turn them off , though that is n't recommended . <p> As you can hopefully ascertain from our interactive comparisons , Very High is the only detail level that reflects every element of the scene , and enables each letter of the Subway sign to reflect the light cast by its neighboring letters . In addition , the superior raycast and resolve quality of Very High enables substantially clearer and more detailed reflection of billboards and other signs , more accurate reflection of light , and reflections rendered further into the distance . <p> As the detail level is decreased a continual loss of accuracy and fidelity is noted until we reach " Off " , where real-time Screen Space Reflections are replaced with high-quality Cube Maps , which are controlled by the " Reflection Quality " setting . While comparatively good compared to the Cube Maps in many other games , they 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be used as a last resort on minimum spec machines . <p> Performance : With a spread of 7.1 FPS separating Very High and Off , " Local Reflection Quality " is a moderately-expensive setting , though in our opinion is the cost is well worth it given the importance of reflections to The Division 's image quality and general ' look ' , <p> If Very High is too taxing for your system , try Low , and if you 're still having issues consider dialing-back other settings to enable real-time reflections . <p> Object Detail <p> To adjust the draw distance and level of detail ( LOD ) of building details , road barriers , trash bags , debris , and other objects players can scale the " Object Detail " setting anywhere from 0 to 100% . <p> For those at 1920x1080 , and other comparatively low resolutions , " Object Detail " is especially important as it enables far more detail to be rendered , as Massive Entertainment 's Snowdrop Engine alters object mesh LOD by pixel size . At resolutions such as 4K significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Object Detail " on image quality , though it can still add extra detail to rendered objects , and will still remove detail on its lowest values . <p> At typical view heights and angles , the setting 's impact on image quality is n't quite as pronounced at 1920x1080 , although if you look careful you can still observe the loss of detail on many background objects . <p> Combined with " Extra Streaming Distance " , the fidelity of distant detail can be greatly improved in certain scenes , and moderately in most others . <p> Performance : With a distant view , " Object Detail " cost up to 11 frames per second in our tests , though it may have a greater cost for you if you have a slower CPU given the relatively high CPU impact of the setting . To determine if you 're hitting the limits of your CPU , you can download MSI Afterburner and monitor CPU utilization with the in-game overlay . <p> Parallax Mapping <p> If you wish to improve the visible detail of a surface , but do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call on techniques such as Bump Mapping , Parallax Occlusion Mapping , and the superior but similarly named Parallax Mapping . These techniques add depth and detail to surfaces , but under close examination the added depth is found to be simulated , lacking genuine bumps that can affect casted shadows , shading , and other effects . <p> In the case of The Division , the massive world is filled with surfaces that can benefit from added detail , but to do it with added geometry or tessellation would simply be too expensive on current-day systems . And as players are in third-person and the camera 's pulled back , most wo n't examine surfaces closely , making Parallax Mapping the ideal technique for improving the fidelity of walls , windows , streets , and other game elements . <p> Parallax Mapping is most obviously applied to brick walls and other surfaces that you 'd expect to be bumpy in real-life . In addition , it 's also applied in some unexpected locations , as demonstrated below . <p> Performance : Parallax Mapping is an inexpensive setting , costing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added detail it appears to add , it 's well worth enabling . <p> Particle Detail <p> Steam , smoke , embers and explosions are all comprised of particles in The Division , as are many other visual effects . With the " Particle Detail " setting the resolution of these effects can be adjusted , and the number of particles increased or decreased . <p> As ever , capturing the full impact of a dynamic particle effect is next to impossible in screenshots , though we can somewhat demonstrate the change to particle rendering resolution in the following set of interactive comparisons . <p> On " Ultra " everything is rendered at native resolution , and in motion you 'd see extra particles that are also rendered on High . At lower detail levels particle resolution is gradually reduced before coming to a stop on " Low " , where the resolution is one-quarter . As a result , the blending with background detail worsens , leading to the unsightly situation you can see in our screenshot . <p> Performance : Barrels , flamethrower enemies , burning wrecks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles . With " Particle Detail " cranked to the max these can take a heavy toll , especially during combat when several flamethrower enemies are setting fire to the environment before having their fuel tanks detonated by a well-placed sniper shot . <p> Given the blending issues that can occur on " Low " , we recommend most players stick with " High " for higher-quality particle effects featuring additional particles . <p> Post FX AA <p> The Division utilises Post-Process Anti-Aliasing to smooth jagged edges and anti-alias transparent textures , transparent surfaces , and particles . In addition , the always-on " Temporal AA " setting further improves the state of anti-aliasing , and does such a good job that Post FX AA is barely needed . <p> Under the microscope , and in interactive comparisons , the impact can just about be seen , although it is particularly subtle . <p> Performance : Massive Entertainment 's high-quality SMAA implementation can cost up to 4 frames per second to activate , so if you 're in need of performance dial the setting back down to Low and regain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Division 's reflections come courtesy of " Local Reflection Quality 's " real-time Screen Space Reflections . Those that do n't are seen on shop windows , far off into the distance , or high in the sky on the sides of skyscrapers . As mentioned earlier , these are lower-quality , static Cube Maps that are far cheaper to render . <p> Unusually , The Division 's Cube Maps are updated as needed if a player is moving around the environment , or every minute or so if they 're stationary , roughly reflecting the detail behind the player . Furthermore , these Cube Maps can feature a basic reflection of larger particle effects , such as the continuous fire , smoke and steam effects . And as also mentioned earlier , if " Local Reflection Quality " is switched to " Off " , any remaining reflections are switched to Cube Maps , increasing their importance . <p> The impact therefore of " Reflection Quality " varies substantially : if " Local Reflection Quality " is enabled there are few surfaces that will receive Cube Maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels will likely go unnoticed . If however " Local Reflection Quality " is disabled , " Reflection Quality " will affect numerous highly visible reflections and surfaces . <p> In the following interactive comparisons the fidelity , accuracy , and coverage of these Cube Map reflections are highlighted ( be sure to click on the Screen Space Reflection comparison , too , to see how the Cube Maps compare to Local Reflection Quality 's real-time reflections ) . <p> Performance : When Cube Maps are n't being refreshed " Reflection Quality " has zero performance impact . In the split second when they are refreshed , performance dips ever so slightly . And as the quality of the Cube Maps are increased these momentarily dips cost that bit more . <p> The exact cost is impossible ascertain however as Cube Maps refresh at their own pace , and the dynamic world can seemingly have a larger impact on performance than the " Reflection Quality " setting itself . Even in the in-game benchmark , over repeated runs , an exact cost remains unclear . What we can confidently say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so small that it does n't make a noticeable dent in any benchmark or test we 've run . And as such , almost all systems can likely enable " High " without issue . <p> NVIDIA HFTS greatly improves upon existing shadow techniques , delivering the highest-quality shadows seen to date in gaming , with near-perfect contact shadowing and vastly improved screen-wide shadows that are free from artifacts , overlapping , aliasing , and other issues encountered by previous techniques . Specifics about HFTS 's technology will be revealed by Jon Story , NVIDIA 's Senior Developer Technology Engineer , at his GDC presentation entitled Advanced Geometrically Correct Shadows for Modern Game Engines . Shortly thereafter information will also be posted to GeForce.co.uk , and in a guide update . <p> For those lacking GeForce GTX 900 Series Maxwell graphics cards , The Division also includes NVIDIA PCSS , a platform and hardware-agnostic DirectX 11 percentage closer soft shadow technique that improves upon the quality of shadowing offered by the game 's " High " and " Low " options . This progressively softens shadows as the distance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality . In contrast , the game 's default options only offer hard , unrealistic shadows that are clearly seen fifty feet from the shadow caster . <p> Our first set of interactive comparisons exemplify the level of fidelity offered by the new HFTS technique , which is capable of accurately rendering the shadow of each individual spoke , as well as the numerous overlapping shadows cast by the street lamp , bike stand , and bike . <p> In our second set of comparisons HFTS 's contact shadow improvements are exemplified , enabling accurate shadows on even the smallest details , such as the cash machine 's lock and the security camera 's lens . <p> Please note , during evenings and nights HFTS is switched to PCSS to better cater for the more-diffuse lighting seen once the Sun goes down . Therefore , if you wish to benchmark HFTS or capture HFTS screens and videos you 'll need to do it during the day . <p> Performance : HFTS doubles the shadow resolution of shadows game wide , and implements a ton of cutting-edge shadow technology to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date . Unsurprisingly then , the bar-raising shadow technique requires a few frames per second , though it in our opinion well worth it on a high-end system . <p> Performance : If you 're opting for High or Low " Shadow Quality " you should definitely pony up the performance for the highest quality " Shadow Resolution " , to maximise the clarity of the two hard shadow techniques . <p> Sharpening <p> Post-Process Anti-Aliasing and Temporal Anti-Aliasing unavoidably soften the screen when doing their thing . Often , enthusiasts will turn to tools like ReShade to counteract this softness through the injection of screen sharpening . This typically introduces additional aliasing or temporal aliasing , and in some cases can get players into hot water with anti-cheat tools in multiplayer games . <p> To save players the trouble of jumping through hoops , The Division includes an in-game Sharpening setting that goes from 0 to 100% . <p> Sharpening will cost you a fraction of a frame per second , so simply set it to your tastes . <p> Spot Shadow Count <p> The shadows affected by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon , and a few other sources . For shadows cast as a result of illumination from an artificial light , such as a spotlight , floodlight , street light , bedside lamp , and so on and so forth , we need to look to the " Spot Shadow Count " and " Spot Shadow Resolution " settings . <p> " Spot Shadow Count " dictates the number of shadows that can appear at any one time as a result of artificial illumination , with higher settings adding additional shadows further into the distance . To best demonstrate we took to the skies with the freecam : <p> On Ultra , all Spot Shadows are nicely defined , but as we drop down to High and then Medium clarity is gradually lost , as is the contact point with the shadow caster , causing our avatar to miraculously float on the carousel . <p> Performance : Maxing out the resolution of The Division 's highly visible , pervasive Spot Shadows will cost you just under 5 frames per second . <p> If you need to improve performance , consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would n't recommend going any lower due to the aforementioned contact shadowing issues . <p> Sub-Surface Scattering <p> To accurately render skin in games , additional techniques and technologies are required . In real and virtual worlds light bounces from most objects and surfaces , which we can accurately and easily render with any number of technologies . In comparison , light striking skin is absorbed and diffused , with some rays being re-emitted , though at a lower intensity . Without a suitable technology simulating this effect character skin is uniformly lit , detracting from the quality of the picture . <p> In The Division , Subsurface Scattering ( SSS or SSSSS ) is employed to achieve the desired result . And , interestingly , to also replicate the reflection and refraction of light on snow and other materials . <p> On characters you 'll need to get particularly close to observe SSS in action . In contrast , SSS on snow is readily seen throughout the game . <p> Performance : " Sub-Surface Scattering " costs around 2.5 frames per second , and is recommended for players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp image , with sharp shadows and Sharpening , may however prefer to disable the setting . <p> Temporal AA <p> Temporal Anti-Aliasing ( TAA ) tackles shimmering and flickering of anti-aliased edges when the camera or player 's viewpoint is in motion , or game elements in the scene are moving . For instance , as each tree , branch , leaf , and blade of grass sways in the wind , temporal aliasing may be observed , greatly diminishing the quality of the picture . <p> Temporal Aliasing is also often exacerbated by Post-Process Anti-Aliasing , Sharpening , and low rendering resolutions , but in this case The Division does n't suffer thanks to its always-on , high-quality Temporal Anti-Aliasing . <p> Why is it always on ? Because Massive Entertainment can use TAA and its underlying tech to accelerate the rendering of other effects , reducing their performance cost . Case in point , Massive 's Ambient Occlusion technique that costs just a single frame per second to enable , and 2.4 frames per second to max out . <p> This same speedup enables the TAA effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance cost of just 0.05ms , which almost entirely eliminates temporal aliasing in The Division . Furthermore , this Supersampled TAA helps to further reduce edge and transparency aliasing , improving image quality by an even greater degree . <p> In static scenes some minor edge flickering may be observed . In our experience it was never noticeable during gameplay , but just in case it impacts your enjoyment of The Division , Massive has included an alternative " Stabilisation " setting that prevents flickering . You do however lose the image quality improvements granted by Supersampling . <p> Performance : Stabilisation runs fractionally faster than the default Supersampling option , which does a brilliant job at improving image quality through the removal of edge , transparency and temporal aliasing . <p> Texture Quality <p> You may have noticed that The Division lacks a Texture Quality option . Instead , Massive Entertainment 's Snowdrop Engine dynamically streams content in and out as needed . Depending on your " Extra Streaming Distance " and " Object Detail " settings this may happen frequently , and there may be pop-in as new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aims to utilise 75% of your dedicated video memory ( VRAM ) , leaving space for other GPU-accelerated , memory-consuming apps that may be running the background . Within this 75% block of memory , which may be exceeded , memory is earmarked for any settings you 've enabled that use VRAM , and the rest divvied up between geometry , other necessary game elements , and textures required right this second . Any remaining memory is filled with additional textures for nearby areas , reducing the chance of pop-in and visible streaming as players travel through the world . <p> As such , users of GPUs with less than 6GB of VRAM may not receive maximum-quality textures at all times . Whether you do or do n't is based on the selected screen resolution , the detail of the current area , and the quality selected for game settings . <p> If you do somehow fill your GPU 's available VRAM , perhaps with a high resolution and max settings on a 4GB GPU , The Division will do its best to scale back detail to rectify performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dial back the aforementioned settings , or the resolution . <p> At 1920x1080 , the most commonly-used gaming resolution , 4GB of memory should sufficient for max settings . <p> Vignette <p> An extremely subtle effect , Vignette slightly darkens the corners of the screen , at the cost of a fraction of a frame per second . <p> Volumetric Fog <p> Mist , fog , and other fog-like environmental conditions add a great deal to The Division 's world , especially when lit by surrounding light sources . With the " Volumetric Fog " setting , the resolution of the volume maps can be adjusted . <p> Most typically , the only observable difference between detail levels comes from the lighting of fog volumes , which is more accurate and pronounced on High and Ultra , as demonstrated in the interactive comparisons below . <p> Performance : Activating Ultra-quality Volumetric Fog costs a fair few frames per second , I 'm afraid , but even on " Medium " things still look pretty good . If you can though , select " High " , which is pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Settings Wrap-Up <p> As you 've likely gathered by now The Division can be quite demanding when every setting is maxed out . You do n't have to run at max settings , but many an enthusiast desires that definitive level of detail . So for those that want to know , here is the GeForce GTX 900 Series benchmarked at three of the most popular resolutions , with max settings enabled : <p> Click to enlarge . All GPUs running at reference speeds with stock coolers ; 4GB GPUs out of memory at 4K with max settings . <p> If you want to improve performance , many settings can be dialed back a notch with only a small hit to image quality .

@@20827495 @827495/ <h> Metro : Last Light Bundled With GeForce GTX Graphics Cards <p> Metro 2033 was one of the breakout hits of 2010 , coming from nowhere to sell well over a million copies .

But Christian Ost of Complx Design should n't be ashamed of that placement when it meant going up against the likes of notable past PDXLAN contest winners , and GeForce Garage veterans , such as Brian " Boddaker " Carter and BS Mods . This just goes to show the amazing level of talent and builds that come out of PDXLAN . <p> So what 's makes Node so special ?

With my latest project -Node- I wanted a system I could take to LAN parties , but I wanted to do something interesting with it .

I eventually went back and looked at it from a different perspective and shrunk the design down into its current size .

In this guide , we walk you through each of the most important decisions to make when creating your system specifications . We 'll also direct you to some awesome resources to lend a hand , such as trusted hardware review sites and system planning tools . Whether you 're building a home theatre PC , a media server , a top-end gaming rig , a video editing beast , or anything in-between , we 've got you covered . <p> Before running off and adding a bunch of hardware into your shopping cart , you 've got to establish a clearly outlined objective for your PC . Otherwise , you might end up spending more money than necessary on parts you might not need . The best place to start is by deciding what your PC 's main duty is going be . The most common roles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file storage , and photo and/or video editing . Of course , there 's often room for crossover " a video-editing box will likely serve as a fantastic gaming rig . Nevertheless , your PC 's primary function should be what you tailor your parts to . <p> It can also help to elaborate on your main goal once you have it . For example , are you looking for a mid-range PC that 'll mainly tackle graphics-heavy FPSes ? Is your video editing rig going to render 4K video more so than standard HD ? Is your storage server mainly going to collect movies instead of photos and documents ? Small details such as these go a long ways in determining which types of parts should get the majority of your attention . <p> Unless you 're swimming in cash , you 'll need to create a budget , and stick to it like glue . This is one of the most difficult steps , and you 'll discover that it 's remarkably easy to bust the bank . With the exception of tossing together a basic storage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll need to plan on about -400 as a minimum . For mid-level gaming rigs , aim for -800 . For top-tier video editing machines and high-end gaming boxes ( such as those wielding mighty SLI setups ) , you 'll need around -1500 , and sometimes more . <p> It 's also important to include room for shipping costs and extras , such as new monitors , keyboards , mice , LED strips , additional fans , and gamepads ( not to mention a new OS , if you go that route ) . The good news is there are plenty of decent , budget parts to choose from . It 's always better to aim for a lower number rather than jacking up your credit card and regretting it later . <p> It 's entirely possible that some of your current components ( if you already own a PC , that is ) will do the job just fine in your next machine . Avoiding a pointless upgrade is a terrific way to free up that oh-so-frustrating budget . There 's little reason to toss hard drives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already have will absolutely save you money . For your RAM , motherboard , GPU , power supply , sound cards , and other parts , you 'll want to check out the tech forums and hardware sites to gather info on whether they 'll work for your next type of rig . Here are some of the handiest places to visit : <p> When seeking direct feedback from people , be sure to list out your system 's main goal , and any of those small details that go with it ( the more info you provide , the better ) . And obviously , you 'll need to include the exact specifications of your older hardware . If you 're unsure of what parts you have , download CPU-Z , and click on each of its tabs . For your PSU , you 'll need to pop off the side panel of your case and take a look at its label . <p> Each type of build goes best with a certain kind of case . For systems with a lot of parts , such as gaming rigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a smart choice " the extra space will pay off big time when routing those never-ending power and data cables , and it 'll be easier to keep your system cool ( cramped , wire-infested areas tend to degrade airflow from fans , and installing liquid cooling loops in small cases can be rough ) . <p> That said , a spacious mid-tower chassis is usually fine as a fallback , especially if your budget is ready to crack . Just keep in mind that smaller cases can restrict upgrading to extra hardware , such as installing 3-way SLI . On the other side of the coin , a small form-factor is best for home theatre PCs and storage/media servers , since you 'll likely want those nestled out of view , and taking up as little space as possible . <p> When it comes to deciding on a particular case brand or visual style , PCpartpicker is an invaluable resource ; you can easily compare case types , ratings , prices , and more . It 's also a good move to check out case reviews from well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got your eye on is truly up to snuff . For more details on that , take a peek at the section below . <p> Maybe you 've got a list of desired parts dancing around your head , maybe not . Regardless , it 's in your best interests to read the reviews on all your potential hardware from trusted , reputable sources . This is doubly important if you 're not sure where to start " many places have awesome , pre-configured builds to choose from , which can really save you time and money . You can also use reviews to make sure certain parts will play well with others , and to see what kinds of warranties and perks they offer ( some manufacturers pony up free stuff with their gear , such as PC games and software suites ) . For reviews on specific components , here are some of the best people in the business : <p> Getting your parts from the right store is just as important as doing your research through reviews . If you go with a cheap , unknown website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware , the wrong gear , or not being able to return anything if something happens to go screwy . If you 've landed on a store already , double-check its customer feedback . <p> Once you 've taken a deep breath , opened your wallet , and bought all your hardware , kick off your shoes and relax for a bit " you 've earned it ! After that , it 's time to unpack the parts , lay everything out , and start putting the system together . You might even consider making a build log , so you can show off the evolution of your wonderful new rig from start to finish .

@@20827511 @827511/ <p> Halo Wars 2 " the highly anticipated follow-up to 2009 's Halo Wars " goes live on PC starting February 21st . Just like the first adventure , you 'll build up bases , create units , and take control of them all in real-time strategy gameplay . And with a full single-player campaign containing a brand-new enemy , The Banished , as well as five specific multiplayer modes , you 'll have plenty of different ways to stay glued to the screen . <p> The original Halo Wars took place in the year 2531 , 20 years prior to Halo : Combat Evolved , the game that began the Halo franchise . Halo Wars 2 picks up shortly after the events of Halo 5 : Guardians , however , for reasons we wo n't spoil . In this sequel , the cast of characters find themselves at a Forerunner installation called the Ark , which created Halo rings : gigantic megastructures that the Forerunners once used to examine and contain the Flood . On the surface of the Ark , the UNSC forces come face-to-face with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covenant . <p> Halo Wars 2 builds off and elaborates on many of the concepts from Halo Wars 1 , including a rock-paper-scissors kind of unit balancing . For example , ground vehicles can be used to neutralise infantry , while infantry are powerful against aircraft . At the same time , aircraft are potent countermeasures against ground vehicles . This kind of approach makes it easy for RTS newcomers to get into the game , but still retains a lot of tactical depth for strategy veterans . The game was developed by Microsoft Studios ' 343 Industries and the highly praised Creative Assembly , who made critically praised RTS games such as Medieval : Total War 1 and 2 , Total War : Shogun 2 , Total War : Warhammer , and many others . <p> From a top-down perspective , you 're in charge of base-building , resource management , creating units , defending objectives , and conquering enemy bases . The gameplay unfolds through non-stop action , and you 'll need to combine quick reflexes , multitasking , and tactical expertise to complete your missions . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the units will look familiar . You 'll have access to M12 Force Application Vehicle Warthogs , M808 Main Battle Tank Scorpions , G77S Pelican Gunships , and lots of others . There are also new Halo Wars units too , such as the Jackrabbit , Kodiak , and EV-44 Support VTOL . <p> There are plenty of multiplayer options too . In Skirmish mode , you 're pitted against numerous AI difficulty levels on any other multiplayer mode or environment desired . While there , you can team up with AI partners or your pals ( through co-op ) to conquer the opposition . Stronghold mode focuses on fast-paced gaming where you must control more bases than anyone else when the timer hits zero . Then there 's Domination , which uses the traditional RTS elements from Halo Wars ( base building , army creation , etc. ) , but with with all the new units , leaders , and special abilities from Halo Wars 2 . There 's also Deathmatch , where it 's 1v1 or 3v3 and players fight it out until only one person or one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most unique new multiplayer options . In Blitz , you 'll create a deck of digital cards , composed of a leader that represents your faction , hand-picked individual units ( or groups of units ) , and abilities . Blitz is completely playable in co-op too , so one player can hone in on one type of gameplay " such as healing " while another can focus on a separate play style , such as defense or offense . You then spend energy ( found randomly on the in-game map ) to play a card from your deck . Since some cards cost more than others to activate , creating a balanced set of cards can be pivotal . To earn card types , you 'll simply need to play through the single-player campaign . You can also purchase card-packs , though Creative Assembly reassures that doing so wo n't be a pay-to-win kind of deal . <p> Playing Halo Wars 2 on the PC brings some awesome benefits , including higher resolution support , increased graphical fidelity , and of course mouse and keyboard support for superior RTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gamepad too , if you prefer ) . The PC version also unlocks a whole host of video settings to tweak , including level of detail , texture filtering , texture quality , anti-aliasing , shadow map resolution , foliage and terrain quality , ambient occlusion , and more . Halo Wars 2 is already a gorgeous game at default settings , but with many of the options increased , it looks stunning . <p> Halo Wars 2 is published by Microsoft , and it 's an Xbox Play Anywhere title . That means you can buy a copy digitally , and then play the game on both your Windows 10 PC and your Xbox One . There 's also Halo Wars 2 Ultimate Edition , which includes a Season Pass ( which grants access to future DLC in the form of an eventual campaign addition , extra units , new leaders , and new Blitz cards ) , the ability to play the game four days early , and an extra game in the form of Halo Wars : Definitive Edition " an enhanced copy of Halo Wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new achievements . <p> To get the best possible experience at 1920 x 1080 resolution , the developers recommend the GeForce GTX 1060 . If you decide to turn up the video settings and run your games at higher resolutions , such as 2160 x 1440 , a GeForce GTX 1070 is your best bet . Halo Wars 2natively supports 4K resolution as well , in which case a GTX 1080 is the card to use .

That 's why we created the ultimate list of tools that 'll keep you covered under almost any situation ( even on the go ) . And for those wary about whether or not to pop open the side of their rig and dive in , do n't worry " none of these implements require a degree from MIT to use . If you can turn a screwdriver or manipulate a set of tweezers , you 're ready for action . <h> Phillips-Head Screwdriver <p> Most of your PC can be effectively field-stripped with just this single , versatile tool .

What results is a stifling sense of claustrophobia , and frustrating lack of self-control , despite the fact that you 're in a weightless environment and surrounded by an almost limitless void . Navigating between parts of the wrecked space station while trying to find and grapple with life-saving oxygen tanks is a bewildering and heart-pounding exercise . <p> The VR version of ADR1FT heightens everything , right down to the fact that the developer has adapted your HUD so that it is projected on the inside surface of your helmet 's visor so you have to keep looking down to check your vitals and oxygen levels .

Pushing three GeForce GTX 580s operating in SLI to their limit , Samaritan wowed all with a level of fidelity previously unseen in a real-time demonstration . At GDC 2012 Epic showed the Samaritan demo once more , but instead of three GTX 580s the demo was powered by a single Kepler ' graphics card , later revealed to be the GTX 680 , our flagship GPU . <p> Unbeknown to most , Epic was also showing its closest partners a first look at Unreal Engine 4 , the studio 's next-generation development platform said to feature all of Samaritan 's enhancements , a new development pipeline , and a raft of new technology .

The holy grail of anything is by definition difficult , expensive , or simply the stuff of science fiction . Perhaps that 's why we want it so bad . <p> The holy grail of computer graphics is real-time Global Illumination . Global Illumination is a way of rendering the game world by simulating the behavior of light as it bounces from surface to surface . But emulating nature at the photon level is a very expensive business , which is why Global Illumination has only been used selectively to render complex CGI scenes in films . <p> That 's about to change . With Unreal Engine 4 , games will be rendered for the first time with Global Illumination in real-time . To understand the implications of this we spoke to Tim Sweeney , the founder of Epic Games and mastermind of all things Unreal . <h> What are the key design goals for Unreal Engine 4 ? <p> We have three big goals : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are achievable with DirectX 11 PC 's and future consoles . <p> Second , to deliver a toolset with an unprecedented mixture of power , ease-of-use , and polish . <p> And finally , to scale the technology and its feature set up and down the spectrum of future computing devices , including iOS and Android , and mainstream PC . <h> What is the target platform for UE4 ? What kind of hardware are gamers going to need to run UE4 based games ? <p> Unreal Engine 4 's next-generation renderer targets DirectX 11 GPU 's and really starts to become interesting on hardware with 1+ TFLOPS of graphics performance , where it delivers some truly unprecedented capabilities . However , UE4 also includes a mainstream renderer targeting mass-market devices with a feature set that is appropriate there . <p> The Samaritan demo we showed at GDC 2011 was just an early prototype to test out some next-generation ideas our graphics team had . UE4 technologies go well beyond that , starting with a new real-time indirect lighting pipeline that fundamentally changes the kinds of scenes that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it so important to game realism ? <p> Global Illumination refers to the calculation of light bouncing around a scene . GI is responsible for many of the subtle shading effects and ambience we see in real-world environments , as well as glossy and metallic reflections . Introducing real-time Global Illumination into Unreal Engine 4 is the biggest breakthrough in lighting since Unreal Engine 1 introduced real-time Direct Illumination in 1995 . <h> Please give us an overview of how the algorithm works from generating the octree , to cone tracing , to the gathering pass . <p> The technique is known as SVOGI " Sparse Voxel Octree Global Illumination , and was developed by Andrew Scheidecker at Epic . UE4 maintains a real-time octree data structure encoding a multi-resolution record of all of the visible direct light emitters in the scene , which are represented as directionally-colored voxels . That octree is maintained by voxelizing any parts of the scene that change , and using a traditional set of Direct Lighting techniques , such as shadow buffers , to capture first-bounce lighting . <p> Performing a cone-trace through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , and angle ) yields an approximation of the light incident along that path . <p> The trick is to make cone-tracing fast enough , via GPU acceleration , that we can do it once or more per-pixel in real-time . Performing six wide cone-traces per pixel ( one for each cardinal direction ) yields an approximation of second-bounce indirect lighting . Performing a narrower cone-trace in the direction of specular reflection enables metallic reflections , in which the entire scene is reflected off each glossy surface . <p> Editor 's Note : If the above sequence seems alien to you , it 's because it is . Global Illumination requires a totally new lighting pipeline . In a traditional game , all indirect lighting ( light that is bounced from a surface ) is calculated in advance and stored in textures called lightmaps . Lightmaps give game levels a GI-look but since they are pre-computed , they only work on static objects . <p> In Unreal Engine 4 , there are no pre-computed lightmaps . Instead , all lighting , direct and indirect , is computed in real-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2D texture , they are stored in voxels . A voxel is a pixel in three dimensions . It has volume , hence the term " voxel . " <p> The voxels are organized in a tree structure to make them efficient to locate . When a pixel is rendered , it effectively asks the voxel tree " which voxels are visible to me ? " Based on this information it determines the amount of indirect light ( Global Illumination ) it receives . <p> The simple takeaway is this : UE4 completely eliminates pre-computed lighting . In its place , it uses voxels stored in a tree structure . This tree is updated per frame and all pixels use it to gather lighting information . <h> Other game engines also claim to have real-time GI in one flavor or another . What makes the UE4 implementation unique ? <p> Techniques such as Light Propagation Volumes have shipped in past games , and provided an approximate solution for real-time diffuse Global Illumination . The SVOGI solution in UE4 is unique in that it allows a full-scene indirect specular and reflective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metallic and glossy surfaces . <h> DirectX Compute is used extensively in the renderer . Tell us a bit more about that . <p> In the UE4 Elemental demo , the majority of the GPU 's FLOPS are going into general compute algorithms , rather than the traditional graphics pipeline . This should n't be surprising , as the core of the traditional pipeline is fed by fixed-function hardware and will ultimately be saturated given more performance at a fixed resolution . But the compute pipeline has unlimited forward scalability , so the compute trend should only grow in the future . <h> How has the PhysX engine evolved in UE4 ? How is it used in the demo ? <p> We used PhysX for all collision queries in UE4 , and all the physics objects you see in the interactive part of the demo ( hammer , statues , planets etc ) . <h> From an artist 's perspective , how does making a game using UE4 differ from existing graphics engines ? <p> Despite the advanced graphical feature set , the tools are actually the most unprecedented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes way beyond our past engine efforts , enabling artists and designers to take control of far more of the pipeline than was possible in the past . <h> Thanks for speaking with us Tim . <p> To conclude , check out high-resolution , direct feed frame buffer screenshots below .

Netbooks , the least expensive , are suited to web browsing , as their name suggests , and little more . Business notebooks are a step up , handling word processing and other work tasks with ease , but again , little else . The most common category of notebook is the multimedia notebook , popularised by Apple 's range of products . These machines feature mid-range processors , integrated graphics processors that can accelerate web content and videos , and an assortment of technologies , such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth . <p> The more expensive multimedia notebooks may also include dedicated GPUs that increase performance dramatically , but not to the degree to ensure that modern-day , demanding games are playable . Sure , they will handle the classics just fine , but today 's games demand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To play those games on a portable computer , a recent notebook GPU is required , and within NVIDIA 's line-up there are two types that fit the bill . The first is the GT class of mobile GPUs , capable of playing titles at low-to-medium detail settings at a notebook 's native resolution , depending on the model , supporting hardware , and game .

The response from customers has been fantastic , and as with desktop GPU drivers , NVIDIA has improved performance in numerous games to a noticeable degree , as this chart shows : <p> The GTX 560M is the fastest GeForce 500M-series GPU NVIDIA has ever made , and handles the same titles that desktop users enjoy on a daily basis with ease , and though the faster GTX 480M exists , it lacks the efficiency improvements and updated technology of the 560M , restricting it to desktop replacement rigs that will never leave the comfort of their AC adapters . With the addition of Optimus and 3D Vision on certain manufacturers ' models , the GTX 560M gives you up to five hours of battery life when working , and then let 's you relax with a spot of 3D Vision-enhanced first-person shooting in Duke Nukem Forever or any of the other five-hundred supported 3D titles , making it a truly portable mobile games machine . <p> If you 're looking for something that allows you to be productive , allows you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent LAN events with the minimum of fuss , the GTX 560M-powered machines are the perfect choice - whilst your friends are lugging their heavy , expensive PCs to and fro , and their monitors , and their accessories , you can just pick up your machine and go .

@@20827548 @827548/ <p> Last week we featured a weathered Fallout 4 mod by Craig Tate , just one of the three main prizes for our Fallout 4 Share Every Win contest that ends on 4th March . Not to be outdone , Modders Inc. head honcho Dewayne Carel created this incredible 2-in-1 design ; one side cryogenic chamber , one side vault door , this unique mod is packed with detail . <p> Read on to learn more about Dewayne 's thought process and modding techniques . <h> What was the thought process behind the 2-in-1 design ? <p> With this case I wanted something that would represent something new and old from Fallout 4 . With this in mind , I thought that the freezing chamber would be great for the new side of the mod as it would lend itself to incorporating a side window into the case . The other side I decided to place the 111 vault door for the old side . The hard part of doing a two style mod on a single case is getting them the blend from one to the other without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few external effects on the case , like the gas cannister and handles of the chamber . What considerations did you make when adding them ? <p> Since I knew it was going to see its fair share of mileage in the back of a delivery truck , the next item on my list was to make it shipping-friendly . This meant the that I could not go overboard with accessories on the outside of the case . So whatever I would put on the outside meant that it needed to define what it was supposed to be with minimal parts . Again the freezing chamber and vault door idea fit the needs . <h> What about the raised panels ? How did you make those ? <p> I could have used a lot of different materials for creating the raised panels for each side of the case . Steel , aluminum , wood and such could have been used but most of that meant adding a lot of weight to the case and that was something I did not want to do so I settled on using foam core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was very easy to work with to design the parts needed . I first created paper templates on each side panel to make sure that the dimensions and look was what I wanted . I then took those templates and transferred them to the foam core boards . Cutting the shape into the foam board was as easy as using a ruler , razor and X-atco knives . I also used my scroll saw to make the long beveled edges on some of the pieces . <p> Painting the foam board was just like painting anything else . I made sure everything was in the shapes I wanted and dust free before I applied the primer . Oh , I did treat the edges of the foam board with drywall patching spackle ... yep , spackle . It is easy to spread on , filled in the holes in the foam , can be sanded to a smooth finish and painted . The worn side that displays the 111 vault and parts on the Fallout 4 case mod was the same technique I used to create my previous Fallout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colours of brown paints on the primer then applying hairspray where I wanted the paint to peel off and then adding the final colour on top of all that . By taking some water and letting it set on the places where the hairspray was applied the water will dissolve the hairspray and will allow you to remove the top coat of paint and exposing the multi-colours or brown below , thus creating the scratch/peeling rusted look .

The real key to future-proofing is the ability to play advanced PC titles using the latest gaming technology like DirectX 11 . Game developers are using DirectX 11 in two key ways : tessellation for detailed geometry and compute shaders for advanced visual effects . To handle these features , a GPU needs a lot of tessellation and shading horsepower . <p> The GeForce GTX 560 Ti has eight tessellation engines , which is much higher than what you 'd expect for a GPU of this class . We pushed the CUDA cores ( which are responsible for shading ) to 1645MHz , the highest clock speed of any Fermi GPU . The end result is a GPU that is really punching above its weight .

What kind of difference are they going to see if they upgrade to a GeForce GTX 560 Ti ? <p> The difference in performance between the 560 Ti and an older DX10 card like the 8800 GT is stunning . The 560 Ti averages about 3.4x faster in gaming performance . In addition , it supports DirectX 11 . In a game like Crysis , that means the difference between gaming at medium ' setting vs. very high ' settings . <p> This is a great time to upgrade if you 're still holding on to a DirectX 9 or 10 class GPU .

A pair of 560 Ti 's in SLI will deliver performance that will exceed even the fastest single GPU in the world " the GTX 580 . <p> The benefit of getting the GTX 580 is that you can upgrade it further .

All three of these custom rigs will be covered in the coming days , but let 's start off first with Ron Lee Christianson and Lee Harrington of Team Mongoose , to learn about their Call of Duty : Black Ops 2 Zombie Mode inspired build . Zombie Mode has since received some additional mods and finishing touches before being sent to one lucky fan ( Brian M. of New Zealand ) , who watched the epic DIY battle live last September and won the custom PC . <p> The dynamic duo of Ron Lee Christianson and Lee Harrington . <h> What first got you into modding ? <p> Lee : I was at an Intel Lanfest and asked CPU Magazine what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the journey . <p> Ron : I was looking for another way to express myself artistically , and was just getting into PC building at the time.I came across several PC mods over the web and decided I would use my sculpting and painting passion and apply it to custom PCs and develop my own style . Now 7 years later I 've had the honour to work within the industry leaders building mods for sponsors trade shows and clients . <h> What were the most valuable skills you 've pick up or learned since then ? <p> Ron : <p> Discipline : working everyday to better my craft and becoming a better artist . <p> Focus : staying true to my style and not swaying from it . <p> Dedication : whether I 'm working on a sponsor project , client or for myself - attention to detail is key . <p> Lee : Nice list , Ron .

@@20827574 @827574/ <h> Next-Gen TXAA Anti-Aliasing In Update For The Secret World <p> For years , Multisample Anti-Aliasing ( MSAA ) has been the de facto technique for removing jagged edges in games , but with the advancement of other features , such as deferred rendering , MSAA 's performance cost has increased . Furthermore , given its limited sample size , MSAA is incapable of tackling temporal aliasing , observed as shimmering on fine geometry and transparent textures , such as fences and corrugated doors when the camera is in motion . <p> Recently , an alternate form of anti-aliasing called FXAA has become popular . A post-process anti-aliasing technique with minimal performance impact , FXAA is supported in many games , such as Batman : Arkham City and The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim , and also can be applied to any game via the NVIDIA Control Panel . Detecting edges in a scene and smoothing them out via a post-process pixel shader , this technique has a performance impact , typically in the range of 3-5% , compared to MSAA 's 40% or more . Unfortunately , FXAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all edges in a scene . <h> TXAA To The Rescue <p> With the launch of the latest Secret World update , gamers can now leverage TXAA , a new anti-aliasing technique introduced with the latest " Kepler " generation of GPUs . Designed specifically to reduce temporal aliasing ( crawling and flickering in motion ) , TXAA is a combination of hardware anti-aliasing , a custom anti-aliasing resolve , and a temporal filter . To filter pixels , TXAA uses a contribution of samples both inside and outside of the pixel in conjunction with samples from prior frames , to offer the highest quality filtering possible . In motion , TXAA approaches the quality of other high end , professional anti-aliasing algorithms , though the higher quality filtering used by TXAA does result in a softer image compared to the lower quality filtering of traditional MSAA . <p> Using hardware MSAA in conjunction with the aforementioned temporal filter , TXAA provides a substantially higher level of fidelity , especially so in motion , for little extra in the way of performance compared to MSAA . In contrast to methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimal performance cost , TXAA is an ultra-high-end option for gamers with the latest videos cards looking for the highest image quality to make games such as The Secret World look their absolute best . <p> As TXAA is best shown in motion , we 've created a HD comparison video to exemplify its benefits compared to FXAA , The Secret World 's other anti-aliasing technique : <p> ... loading movie ... <p> - <p> As you can see , TXAA 's use results in an anti-aliased , slightly softer image , free of unsightly temporal aliasing , which is especially evident in the video 's airport scene when using FXAA . <p> To make use of TXAA Anti-Aliasing via the in-game Video Options Anti-alias quality ' dropdown , Secret World players must use the GeForce 304.79 beta drivers , or newer , and must have a Kepler-based , GeForce GTX 600 Series graphics card in their system . Were MSAA available in The Secret World direct comparisons could be made , but in general 2xTXAA offers visual quality on par with 8xMSAA , with performance similar to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with performance comparable to that of 4xMSAA . <p> To give you an indication of what this means in real-world terms , here 's a look at in-game performance across the GeForce GTX 600 Series range when using FXAA HQ , 2xTXAA , and 4xTXAA . <p> Being a massively multiplayer game it is impossible to provide an exact snapshot of performance in The Secret World given the multitude of areas , varying amounts of players , and radically different geometry , but we feel that the above numbers should represent performance in typical gameplay scenarios . <p> Going by our results , TXAA performs well on any GeForce GTX 600 series Kepler GPU in conjunction with max game settings at 1920x1080 , but please remember that your results will vary with your system configuration . <h> Conclusion <p> Technically , The Secret World is indeed the best-looking MMO ever , and performs well given the features it employs . Tessellation , Screen Space Ambient Occlusion , and Motion Blur all add to the spectacle , while TXAA anti-aliasing virtually eliminates edge aliasing , and greatly diminishes temporal aliasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secret World is off to a great start , and its content will continue to be expanded upon each month , beginning with last week 's major update , so if you want a new innovative MMO to play that will be updated month after month , that looks great , and will give your graphics card a workout , you can do no better than The Secret World .

@@20827589 @827589/ <p> Killing Floor 2 is the long-awaited sequel to Tripwire Interactive 's multi-million selling Killing Floor , a co-op first person shooter that redefined horde mode ' with unique gameplay , refreshing humor , and dozens of excellent tweaks and changes that have enabled Killing Floor to outplay and outlast all other contenders to their best in genre ' crown . With tens of thousands of players every day , five and a half years after release , it 's no wonder anticipation for Killing Floor 2 is reaching fever pitch as we fast approach the sequel 's 2015 Early Access release . <p> In August we announced a technical partnership with Tripwire Interactive , promising the future inclusion of NVIDIA GameWorks technologies that will improve graphics , increase immersion , and make full use of your GeForce GTX GPUs in Killing Floor 2 . Today , we can reveal the first fruits of our partnership , in addition to several other advanced technologies that Tripwire Interactive have recently implemented . <h> NVIDIA HBAO+ Ambient Occlusion <p> Ambient Occlusion ( AO ) adds contact shadows where two surfaces or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching another nearby game element . The AO technique used and the quality of the implementation affects the shadowing 's accuracy , and whether new shadows are formed when the level of occlusion is low . Without Ambient Occlusion , scenes look flat and unrealistic , and objects appear as if they are floating . <p> The image below links to an interactive comparison demonstrating HBAO+ On vs . HBAO+ Off . Note the lack of shadows on the theater stairs , and the general improvement in shadowing screen-wide , on and around objects . <p> The following image shows an AO-only view of a detailed scene , exemplifying the benefits of AO in general . With HBAO+ , shadows are more accurate , of varying intensities , and visible even where the level of occlusion is minimal , such as the inside of the chandelier , where even minute pieces of detail of correctly shadowed . <h> Screen Space Reflections <p> Many man-made materials can reflect detail , but traditionally we see only water , mirrors , glass , and over overly-shiny surfaces reflect detail in games . Increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all suitable surfaces is therefore key to improving immersion , so for Killing Floor 2 Tripwire Interactive has implemented Screen Space Reflections ( SSR ) , enabling all reflective materials and surfaces to accurately reflect any detail screen-wide . <p> In the past , achieving this level of reflective detail was difficult because each reflector required the scene to be re-rendered , inflating CPU draw calls and severely impacting performance . As a result , developers switched to less intensive , less realistic techniques with limited reflective properties . Tripwire Interactive 's solution , however , sees SSR run entirely on the GPU , reducing the performance impact greatly . And as the examples here demonstrate , the improvements to image quality are considerable . <p> Tripwire 's SSR reflections also interact with their innovative Persistent Blood System , which sees all player and enemy blood persist on-screen for the duration of the match . In addition to literally painting the levels red , Tripwire 's blood modifies the shininess of the underlying materials , intensifying reflections as demonstrated in the interactive comparison below . <h> Subsurface Scattering <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In games and the real world , light bounces from most objects and surfaces , which we can accurately and easily render with any number of technologies . In comparison , light striking skin is absorbed and diffused , with some rays being emitted , though at a lower intensity . Without a suitable technology simulating this effect , character skin is uniformly lit , detracting from the quality of the picture . <p> In Killing Floor 2 , players are surrounded by friends and enemies at all time , making accurate skin rendering a must . The solution for Tripwire Interactive : Jorge Jiminez 's Screen Space Sub-Surface Scattering ( SSSSS ) , an improved version of Sub-Surface Scattering ( SSS ) seen in several recent games . <p> Compared to traditional SSS , SSSSS only shades skin visible from the player 's perspective , which is particularly important for Killing Floor 2 , where hundreds of enemies can attack simultaneously . Without this SSS addition , the performance cost would be crippling . SSSSS also introduces level of detail features , ensuring Subsurface Scattering on a distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low performance impact . Again , key for a game with hundreds of characters visible across a level . <p> The interactive comparison below highlights the benefits of Subsurface Scattering on two of Killing Floor 2 's zeds ' in a room with high-intensity lighting . <h> Bloom <p> Bloom lighting has been a standard part of real-time post processing for many years , adding flares of light and added visual intensity around bright lights and brightly lit objects and surfaces . Typically , Bloom is implemented by filtering out dark pixels and blurring bright ones , but for Killing Floor 2 Tripwire Interactive has improved upon this technique by downsampling and blurring bright pixels six times , and adding a weighted average of the blurred images to the final color output . This result is a higher-quality and wider bloom effect for little additional cost , versus performing a single blur pass . <p> Artists can additional tune the bloom intensity and other values to achieve a variety of aesthetic looks , varying the appearance of locations and effects . This approach , similar to the technique used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be examined in the interactive comparison below . <h> Motion Blur <p> Killing Floor 2 uses a variable-intensity , screen-space motion blur technique as part of its post processing system to simulate blur caused by fast-moving objects and camera motion . Adapted from the NVIDIA Motion Blur D3D Advanced Sample , freely available from the NVIDIA GameWorks website , Tripwire Interactive 's solution features per-pixel motion information , blur filters , and other technologies to improve the smoothness and quality of motion blur from frame to frame , giving the player a heightened sense of speed when fast-moving enemies attack . <p> Exaggerated examples below demonstrate the object-based blur cast on and around the enemies as they attack . <h> Depth of Field <p> Depth of Field simulates the blurring of out-of-focus regions of an image due to the aperture and focal length of a virtual camera . In Killing Floor 2 , the effect is seen when the player aims a weapon in iron-sights . Objects in the near field are blurred based on the depth of the focal object , and different blur settings are used for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weapon . <p> Behind the scenes , a constant time box filter based on a Summed Area Table is used to implement depth of field blur , enabling Tripwire to vary the size of the blur pixel-to-pixel at a fixed and predictable performance cost . Furthermore , it enables Tripwire to realistically blur the Screen Space Reflections highlighted earlier , simulating the appearance of reflections in reality , and tackling aliasing that may be visible . <p> To demonstrate the above , here 's a screenshot of Killing Floor 2 's night vision effect , which also features color shift , contrast enhancement , film grain , and other techniques . <p> There 's plenty more to come from Killing Floor 2 , including additional graphical enhancements ( NVIDIA PhysX FleX , anyone ? ) , yet to be announced gameplay features , and of course , the 2015 Early Access release on Steam .

@@20827592 @827592/ <p> In addition to day-of-launch Watch Dogs enhancements , 337.88 WHQL also includes a wealth of upgrades and optimizations that boost system performance and improve existing features . Namely , system-wide DirectX 11 and SLI performance optimizations of up to 75% , new technology that reduces game load times , new and updated SLI profiles , and 3D Vision enhancements that optimize DirectX 10 and DirectX 11 3D titles . To learn more , read on . <p> By remaining laser-focused on DirectX 11 ( and the forthcoming DirectX 12 ) , we have dramatically enhanced the efficiency of our DirectX 11 driver , enabling performance gains of up to 75% in DirectX 11 games , and additional benefits in games with multi-GPU SLI support . Unlike changes tailored around custom graphics APIs , our new optimizations can benefit all DirectX 11 titles the second they go on sale , regardless of developer or publisher , and apply to all DirectX 11-capable NVIDIA GPUs . <p> Results will vary depending on your CPU , GPU , Operating System , and system configuration , but you should experience some degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did in our lab on both high-end and low-end hardware . <p> DirectX 11 CPU optimizations enable significant performance gains on affordable systems equipped with GeForce GTX 750 graphics cards , as well as those using the latest technology . <h> SLI Performance Optimizations &amp; Profile Updates <p> Upgrade your rig with a second NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPU to activate SLI , the multi-GPU technology of choice for gamers . With intelligent scaling and industry-leading multi-GPU anti-stutter technology , NVIDIA SLI is the smoothest , most effective way of increasing frame rates by up to 2x . <p> By reducing CPU overhead CPU bottlenecking is minimized or eliminated , reducing its impact on GPU performance , increasing GPU utilization , which is key to increasing frame rates . <p> As with 337.88 WHQL 's single-GPU optimizations , SLI CPU overhead reductions apply globally , benefitting the majority of DirectX 9 , DirectX 10 , and DirectX 11 games the instant they go on sale .

Generally , shaders are compiled during loading screens , or during gameplay in seamless world titles , such as Assassin 's Creed IV , Batman : Arkham Origins , and the aforementioned Watch Dogs . During loads their compilation increases the time it takes to start playing , and during gameplay increases CPU usage , lowering frame rates . When the shader is no longer required , or the game is closed , it is disgarded , forcing its recompilation the next time you play . <p> In today 's 337.88 WHQL drivers we 've introduced a new NVIDIA Control Panel feature called " Shader Cache " , which saves compiled shaders to a cache on your hard drive . Following the compilation and saving of the shader , the shader can simply be recalled from the hard disk the next time it is required , potentially reducing load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> By default the Shader Cache is enabled for all games , and saves up to 256MB of compiled shaders in **35;1090;TOOLONG CorporationNVCache .

You 'll have faster framerates , speedier data transfers , and numerous other benefits that make your PC and games better . But say you do n't have a wad of cash burning a hole in your pocket , how then would you enjoy the delights of Dying Light and other NVIDIA-enhanced PC games ? Well , with a little time and money you can breathe life into just about any PC with a PCI Express slot . Here 's how . <h> Upgrade Your GPU <p> Graphics cards have the biggest effect on game frame rates of all a system 's components . There 's the odd outlier like Rome II that requires a strong CPU , but in the majority of games it 's your GPU pushing the pixels . Upgrading this one component , therefore , can take your low-fi experiences and bring them up to snuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other NVIDIA technologies that make your games look and run better . <p> In the past you 'd likely need a new power supply ( PSU ) to bring a new , lightning fast , power hungry GPU to life , but now things have changed . Today , you can accelerate your gaming with 300 to 400 Watt power supplies , the likes of which are probably in your chassis already . This is thanks to second-generation Maxwell architecture that 's twice as power efficient as previous-generation GPUs , yet far faster , and packed with features galore . For many folks , an upgrade will be as simple as swapping the old GPU out for the new ( some may require commonly-found Molex to PCIE cable adaptors to power the GPU ) . <p> Best of all , this upgrade wo n't break the bank ; critically acclaimed GeForce GTX 960s are available starting at -160 . Your games will run faster , improved optimisation with NVIDIA GameWorks effects like VXGI , HBAO+ and PhysX , and you can further improve image quality and performance with NVIDIA technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're loading last into a multiplayer game , or waiting an age for a single-player level to load , you often feel like your PC is decrepit . Some of that is down to your CPU , GPU and RAM , but the main culprit is your hard disk drive ( HDD ) . Games nowadays can be up to 60GB in size , loading hundreds of files per level , and dozens extra a second while you play . There 's just so much data that even the fastest HDDs can no longer cope , leaving you bored to tears , and teased online . <p> The solution is a solid state drive ( SSD ) . It works like a memory card in a camera or a memory module in a phone , storing data on chips that can be accessed in an instant . They 're so fast they can turn a 2-minute PlanetSide 2 slog into a lighting fast 20 second load , and if also used to store your operating system they can make Windows load near-instantaneously . <p> You 'll probably want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though we recommend 240-256GB , and when they 're not being played you can effortlessly punt them back to your mechanical HDD for archiving with Steam Tool or Steam Mover . At the time of writing 120GB will set you back about -50 , and the price is always falling . It 's not as significant an upgrade as a new GPU , but it will make your game and Windows experiences feel ' faster and more responsive . <h> Jam In Faster RAM <p> If you 've got 4GB of RAM you 're probably struggling to play the latest games , some of which require 8GB . Your RAM 's likely also slower than the newest modules , decreasing game , application and OS performance , and limiting your CPU overclocks . <p> You can fix all that by popping out your old RAM , and upgrading to some new DDR3 1600 or 1866 RAM modules that cost around -50 per 8GB . You should check your motherboard 's manual first , however , as some models may only support x types and y numbers of RAM sticks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though your performance wo n't be quite as good . But for those with 4GB this is a must , especially for open world games like Dying Light , Grand Theft Auto IV and The Witcher 3 . <p> If you do n't fancy scrapping your existing 4GB , try and find an extra 4GB of identical RAM . Mismatched sticks from other brands may work , but we ca n't guarantee it . <h> Overclock Everything ! <p> Many CPUs and GPUs can be overclocked quickly and easily , giving you extra performance for free . Depending on your components overclocks can collectively give you a big boost , making a game playable or enabling you to turn on extra bells and whistles . To learn more check out our overclocking guide . <h> Improve Cooling <p> If you do decide to push the envelope with overclocking , you can improve results by buying more or better case fans , applying new , betterthermal paste to your CPU and heatsink , buying a better air cooled CPU heatsink and fan , or upgrading to a closed loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overclocked these changes can make a great deal of difference , and the improved cooling in your case can benefit other components too , helping you reach higher GPU overclocks and reducing ambient system temperatures for improved stability . <h> **27;1127;TOOLONG Cleaning <p> No matter how clean your home , your PC 's fans constantly suck in dust , skin cells , and the odd bug floating in the air . Over time this builds up , making components hotter , and decreasing fan and heatsink effectiveness . Ultimately , this limits the maximum performance of your CPU and GPU , and can result in instability when playing games . <p> With a can or two of compressed air you can quickly fix this and bring your PC 's performance back to original levels . It 'll also make your system run cooler and quieter , and give you extra headroom for overclocking . Regularly cleaning is a must in maintaining PC health- we recommend dusting out your PC once a month or once a season at minimum ! <h> Update Drivers <p> Updating drivers used to be a confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's easy peasy . Just go to a manufacturer 's website , find their Support or Download section , select your product , download the driver , and install . Updates can improve performance , increase stability , and even unlock new features . <p> For NVIDIA GPUs we recommend GeForce Experience , which automatically updates GPU drivers and game profiles , enables you record gameplay videos , and does a ton of other stuff , too . Each new driver adds support for new games , and often they improve gameplay performance , giving you the definitive experience from the day of a game 's release . <h> Putting It Into Practice <p> We 've talked the talk , but can we walk the walk and put everything we 've said into practice ? To determine this we reached out on Reddit and found a user sorely in need of some upgrades . All they needed was a little trust in our abilities , and the fortitude to live without their gaming PC for a few weeks . Let 's see how we did !

On some scenes , especially where regular shadows are fairly prominent , it may not be very obvious . It 's best enjoyed in the single player campaign where the maps have more complex buildings and environments . <p> Ambient occlusion is a fairly graphically intense operation . Expect a 30-35% performance hit . We recommend using it only when you have a good deal of performance headroom . <p> Finally , because the effect is applied at the driver level , you may see some minor artifacts for certain game settings and maps .

@@20827610 @827610/ <h> Just Cause 3 Graphics &amp; Performance Guide <p> It 's been five long years since Rico Rodriguez last blew stuff up in Just Cause 2 . Now he 's returned home for Just Cause 3 , only to find it under the control of an ever-so-evil dictator , giving him the perfect excuse to blow yet more stuff up , but this time with new gadgets , new guns , new vehicles , and an amazing wing suit that can be combined with your grapple and parachute for unparalleled mobility . <p> Rico 's return also sees a significant technological upgrade , with higher-definition textures , more complex and realistic destruction , the latest graphical effects , and a stunning implementation of our WaveWorks water technology . <p> In this guide we 'll detail these graphics settings and technologies , demonstrate their impact on image quality , reveal their relative performance cost , and also look at an easy-to-implement enhancement made possible by the NVIDIA Control Panel . So come on in for the year 's penultimate GeForce Graphics and Performance Guide . <p> In our testing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when paired with a suitably speedy CPU , but as the GeForce GTX 780 is no longer available for purchase you should instead look to the GeForce GTX 970 for an upgrade or new system build . It 's faster , features additional video memory , and supports our latest range of technologies and effects that make your games even better . The minimum specs , meanwhile , are unable to play beyond low settings at 1920x1080 . <p> Regardless of your system configuration , all NVIDIA GPU users will automatically receive Optimal Playable Settings for Just Cause 3 through GeForce Experience . With a single-click , Just Cause 3 's 13 settings will be auto-configured for your system , instantly delivering a high framerate experience , enabling you to enjoy Just Cause 3 the second you load the game . <p> Just Cause 3 Graphics Settings <p> Anisotropic Level <p> Texture Filtering , Anisotropic Filtering , and other similarly named options affect the sharpness of textures , especially those seen in the distance , on oblique angles , or on the sides of the screen . Without Texture Filtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Performance : Anisotropic Filtering has a negligible impact on performance , with less than 2 frames per second splitting the lowest and highest detail levels . <p> Enabling the improved NVIDIA Control Panel Anisotropic Filtering reduces performance by an additional frame or two per second , which is well worth it given the game-wide improvements it delivers . <p> Anti-Aliasing <p> Just Cause 3 employs low-cost Post-Process Anti-Aliasing ( PPAA ) options to minimise the visibility of jagged edges . On offer are FXAA , SMAA ( 1x ) , and SMAA T2x , as seen in other recent releases . <p> As in those other titles , SMAA T2x includes a temporal anti-aliasing component , helping reduce the shimmering of anti-aliased edges when they or the camera moves , delivering a clearer , albeit softer image that suffers less from temporal aliasing . <p> In our pre-release build it 's worth noting that with Motion Blur disabled , SMAA T2x 's use resulted in the loss of some foliage throughout the game , an issue that has been reproduced on both PC platforms . And with Motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopefully this will soon be resolved as SMAA T2x is almost-always the preferred anti-aliasing option in games where it features . <p> In static shots , SMAA T2x has a significant advantage over SMAA 1x , decreasing the severity of aliasing quite considerably . <p> Performance : At its most expensive , Post-Process Anti-Aliasing will cost you just 4 frames per second in Just Cause 3 , making it a must-have for all systems . <p> Bokeh Depth of Field <p> A simple on-off option , Bokeh Depth of Field toggles the rendering of cinema-style out of focus shapes on blurred detail . That 's the idea at least ; in our testing there was virtually no difference between on and off , with Bokeh-style out of focus shapes appearing regardless . <p> During gameplay with the ' zoom in ' precision aiming mod , and in the pause screen , we observed no improvement or deterioration of the Bokeh effect . <p> Performance : At 4 frames per second Bokeh Depth of Field is an inexpensive effect , albeit one that 's having no affect on our game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero impact on your experience . <p> Edge Fade <p> If you like Vignette photo filters that darken the corners of the picture , Edge Fade 's the setting for you . <p> And if you do like Vignette you 'll be pleased to hear that Edge Fade has an imperceptible performance impact . <p> Global Illumination <p> In the real world , light bounces from surfaces , illuminating surrounding surfaces and objects . In games , light hits a surface and that 's that - the one single surface is illuminated , and even if it 's brighter than the Sun , surrounding surfaces and those not directly lit will be unaffected . Global Illumination attempts to resolve that by approximating the bouncing of light , illuminating surrounding surfaces and objects . <p> When Global Illumination is visible , it heightens the feeling of being in a tropical paradise where the skies are clear , and the sun is always shining . <p> Performance : At up to 17 frames per second Global Illumination is an expensive effect , but it is worth enabling . Perhaps not ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely before some of the less noticeable settings . <p> LOD Factor <p> To adjust the fidelity and visibility of game elements players can switch between four Level of Detail factors , altering the geometric detail of objects and buildings , and the number of objects and game elements that are rendered at medium to long view distances . <p> Between the four detail levels there 's a minimal change to image quality on anything other than Low , making the differences hard to note during gameplay . In-game , lowering the detail level does increase the amount of pop-in , but never does it reach the extent of other recent titles where entire city blocks suddenly appear when turning a corner . <p> Performance : Costing up to 9 frames per second , LOD 's performance impact can take a noticeable toll on low and mid-range PCs , even if the visual difference is minimal during gameplay . <p> As the loss of detail is tricky to observe during gameplay , those seeking extra performance can dial down the LOD Factor without degrading image quality . <p> Screen Space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every body of water , many a rooftop , and many other surfaces and objects reflect all of Just Cause 3 's explosions , effects , surroundings and shenanigans , greatly enhancing image quality game-wide . <p> As you can see below , even wooden surfaces and less reflective materials can be enhanced by the Screen Space Reflections setting , adding an extra layer of polish to an already-beautiful world . <p> Across wider scenes reflections add depth , and on the open seas are particularly beneficial , reflecting wave , wake and environmental detail . <p> Performance : In larger action scenes in suitably reflective locations , Just Cause 3 's Screen Space Reflections can have a tremendous performance impact . Without them though image quality is degraded in virtually every scene . <p> During general run and gun gameplay , expect to see a performance cost of around 8-10 frames per second . <p> Shadow Quality <p> The quality , visibility , fidelity , and draw distance of shadows are controlled by the eponymous Shadow Quality setting . On the highest detail level , Very High , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera and shadow caster , and all but the most distant shadows are clearly visible and distinguishable . Below Very High , everything is dialed back , and even nearby shadows lose definition or are entirely removed . <p> Performance : Given the loss of shadow fidelity that occurs below Very High , most players should attempt to run the best setting out of the box , only dialing it down it if additional performance is required after other settings have also been pared back . <p> SSAO <p> Ambient Occlusion ( AO ) adds contact shadows where two surfaces or objects meet , and where objects block light from reaching another nearby game element . The AO technique used and the quality of the implementation affects the accuracy of AO shadows , and whether new shadows are formed when the level of occlusion is low . Without Ambient Occlusion , scenes appear flat and unrealistic , and objects float on surfaces . <p> There 's a negligible difference between Just Cause 3 's three highest texture detail levels in the majority of locations we 've tested , with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Across the countryside , even Low looks good , as you can see for yourself in the interactive comparisons below . <p> In Just Cause 3 's towns and villages you 're more likely to discover textures that are affected by the setting , but the difference remains slim across Very High , High and Medium , and even on Low they 're not bad . <p> Performance : With no other game elements being affected by the detail levels , Texture Quality has a negligible impact on performance . <p> Water Detail <p> In 2010 Just Cause 2 launched on PC with a multitude of exclusive enhancements . At the forefront was CUDA Water , the first-ever game-ready , GPU-powered water simulation , which added technically-advanced , realistic-looking water that could be naturally interacted with . Check out our 2010 Just Cause 2 Technology Trailer for a detailed demonstration : <p> For Just Cause 3 we 've worked closely with developer Avalanche once again , assisting them with the integration of NVIDIA WaveWorks , a next-generation water simulation with capabilities far beyond those seen in Just Cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Running on the CPU on PC , PlayStation 4 , and Xbox One , WaveWorks is a full multi-resolution spectral simulation solution , capable of simulating any sea state from Beaufort 1 to Beaufort 12 , with a high level of surface detail , right down to centimetre-scale micro-ripples . During the most intense of storms , waves that are up to hundreds of meters in length can be rendered , along with sea foam , crashing waves , and all the detail that you expect to see in the real world . <p> It is these unique capabilities that have enabled Avalanche to realize their vision of a rich and ever-changing ocean surface that 's also capable of affecting the physics of water-borne objects , such as swimmers , jet-skis , other vessels , and the planes and cars you 'll inevitably crash into the ocean during your in-game antics . <p> No other solution can achieve this level of realism or scalability , either on a GPU or CPU , making WaveWorks the go-to choice for Avalanche , and for Gaijin Entertainment , who recently added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free-to-play action game . <p> In Just Cause 3 , WaveWorks ' capabilities enable boats to skip across waves , water to crash on shores , and every body of water to be enhanced and improved immeasurably . Take a look at WaveWorks in action in Just Cause 3 to see what we mean : <p> In addition to the implementation of WaveWorks , our engineers also assisted Avalanche with its modification , creating a wake and ripple system , and tuning other features for integration into the Just Cause 3 engine . <p> The end result is the creation of the most realistic , interactive , and technologically advanced water in gaming , enhancing Just Cause 3 's oceans , lakes and rivers identically on PC , PlayStation 4 , and Xbox One . <p> With an identical CPU-powered simulation implemented across all platforms , the GPU-powered Water Detail setting in the PC edition of Just Cause 3 merely adjusts the fidelity of waves , and the visibility of effects on and beneath WaveWorks-enhanced bodies of water . Examples include water , wave and wake foam , enabled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God Rays . <p> As a dynamic effect it 's impossible to accurately evaluate the fidelity of each detail level in static screenshots , so we 've instead put together a number of video clips that are as like-for-like as we can get . <p> Comparison #001 , Very High <p> Comparison #001 , High <p> Comparison #001 , Medium <p> Comparison #001 , Low <p> Inland and on the coast , the most noticeable difference is the loss of foam on the shore on Low . <p> Out on the open seas , the changes to water detail are more visible , and below High we observe the loss of water , wake and wave foam , which greatly enhances image quality . <p> Comparison #002 , Very High <p> Comparison #002 , High <p> Comparison #002 , Medium <p> Comparison #002 , Low <p> Back on land , we can see that the different detail levels have no impact on the fidelity or visibility of Screen Space Reflections and other settings . <p> Comparison #003 , Very High <p> Comparison #003 , High <p> Comparison #003 , Medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven minutes of ocean exploration , starting with a look at how the water and waves alter when cruising out to sea . <p> Performance : Enhancing the WaveWorks water with foam , caustics , God Rays , and other eye-pleasing effects can cost up to 16 frames per second , but given the pervasive use of water in Just Cause 3 that 's likely a price that most are willing to pay . <p> If you do need to decrease the detail level , try to go no lower than High , which is the last step before eye-pleasing foam effects are disabled . <p> Water Tessellation <p> As stated above , our WaveWorks water simulation runs on the CPU , with the other water-based visual effects developed by Avalanche running off of the GPU . In addition to those , Just Cause 3 's final game setting enables players to add extra tessellated detail to waves , wakes , and ripples , further increasing their level of detail . <p> In the interactive comparison below , this manifests as a smoother water surface that enables the generation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For an in-game , in-motion look at Water Tessellation , check out the two clips below . <p> Comparison #001 , On <p> Comparison #001 , Off <p> Performance : With a GeForce GTX 900 Series GPU , which crunches through tessellation up to three times faster than previous-generation NVIDIA GPUs , Water Tessellation costs around 4 frames per second . A quick test on a previous-generation GeForce GTX 780 suggests that cost may raise to around 7 frames per second on other graphics cards . <p> Water Tessellation adds just a small amount of detail , so if you 're in need of performance it should be one of the first settings you disable . <p> Settings Wrap-Up <p> You 've seen the settings , compared their detail levels , and discovered their performance costs . Now , a look at overall performance at max settings on the complete range of GeForce GTX 900 Series GPUs , at 1920x1080 , 2560x1440 , and 3840x2160 . <p> To collect like-for-like data in 18 benchmark runs we used Just Cause 3 's introductory , plane-riding sequence , which we should note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the times Just Cause 3 is bottlenecked by its impressive CPU-intensive destruction . During these explosive moments , which ca n't be accurately recreated and tested across a multitude of benchmarks , CPU bottlenecking can greatly reduce overall performance . This is why Just Cause 3 's system requirements recommend players equip their systems with Intel Core i7-3770 's . <p> In our experience , throw all the CPU power you can at the game , and overclock to boot ; late-game destruction is glorious to behold , but ever-so intensive . <p> If you require additional performance disable Water Tessellation and Bokeh Depth of Field , turn down the LOD Factor , and lower the Water Quality . If more is required still , turn your attention to the heavy-hitters , like Global Illumination , SSAO , and Screen Space Reflections , which would be a shame to turn off but do each cost a fair few frames per second . If that sounds like too much effort , simply click " Optimize " in GeForce Experience . <p> NVIDIA Dynamic Super Resolution <p> To increase the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( DSR ) to receive up to 4K-quality graphics on your HD monitor . How it works is simple : compatible games , such as Just Cause 3 , are rendered at a higher , more detailed resolution , and the image intelligently shrunk back down to the resolution of your monitor using a custom-made filter , giving you up to 4K-quality graphics on your screen . The video below explains more , and the images show how to activate the setting in the NVIDIA Control Panel . <p> With DSR enabled , textures benefit from improved clarity , aliasing is further reduced , objects have better definition , vegetation is more detailed , and distant game elements are clearer . If you 've used DSR in other games you 'll know of these benefits already , but if you have n't had the chance here 's a look at how Just Cause 3 's graphics scale with rendering resolutions . <p> If you need extra performance overclocking your CPU will pay dividends in Just Cause 3 , which can easily become CPU bottlenecked , limiting your overall performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which also teach you how to overclock your GPU . <p> G-SYNC : Eliminating Stutters &amp; Tearing For The Ultimate Experience <p> NVIDIA revolutionized computer displays in 2013 with the introduction of variable refresh rates , enabling gamers to enjoy highly responsive , tear-free , stutter-free experiences on G-SYNC monitors . Reviews are phenomenal , and gamers everywhere agree that it 's painful to play on anything other than a G-SYNC display once you 're used to the flawless experience it provides . <p> With Just Cause 3 's fast-paced action , frame drops , stuttering and screen tearing can put a damper on the experience . G-SYNC monitors eliminate those issues , letting you blow $#* ! up without distraction . <p> Game Ready Just Cause 3 Driver <p> For the best Just Cause 3 experience we recommend updating to the Just Cause 3 GeForce Game Ready Drivers , which will be released December 1st .

@@20827618 @827618/ <h> YIDIY : Jon " Pennywise " Hansz And His Yoda Build <p> As we continue our spotlight of killer mod builds , and the creative geniuses who craft them , we turn our focus toward May the Fourth and an appropriate work of art . Featured modder Jon " Pennywise " Hansz is on deck with his Yoda Build , themed after the all-too famous diminutive Jedi Master from the Star Wars franchise . Hansz returns to the Geforce Garage after being featured in both our step-by-step hand-lacing guide and our PDXLAN Charity Modding Competition , where he joined forces with Ron Lee Christianson to produce a stunning rig based on The Witcher game series replete with the iconic wolf logo and glowing red eyes to top off that menacing look . <h> Thanks for joining us , Jon . Can you tell us when or how you first got into modding ? <p> It started as something out of necessity , and turned into something more . I really started modding computers about 6 years ago when it was time for me to build another computer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art work , something that I could apply my skills both as an artist and an electrician . So I created Epidemic . <h> Having an applicable skillset definitely helps when you 're ready to dive in . Yet even before this stage , where do you get your inspiration from ? <p> I enjoy building something that has n't been done before . What is inspiring is seeing how much in the past few years people have pushed the bar for quality mods . It really is inspiring to see all the unique ideas people have come up with . <h> No doubt about that ! As you know , we at the GeForce Garage love the modding scene . The level of skill and creativity continues to break new ground . Speaking of which , what new skills have you learned along the way ? <p> As modders we are constantly learning . Not just building mods , but in some cases building tools which are required to build mods . I have a lot of skills that help with my mods . But I would say my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible paint job and airbrushed details were done by the talented Ron Lee Christianson of Blue Horse Studios . <h> Now , six years later , why do you still do it ? <p> Modding is a way to artistically express my self . I love the fact that we build a piece of art that is also functional . <h> Tell us more about that . Going over the steps , can you share how you take a general concept to a fully functional piece of art ? <p> So , I 'm a little old school when it comes to coming up with a concept . I use transfer tape on the case and hand draw my designs . With the Yoda build . I pulled the front transfer tape off and laid it down and began to sculpt Yoda using clay . I do this to get the general form that I will be using . It does n't have to be perfect , just the general shape . Then I use my makeshift vacuum former , which is very easy to use . <h> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , correct ? <p> That 's right . Taking the clay that I sculpted , I made a vacuum form of it , which is the base of all my detail work . The vacuum form is riveted on and it keeps the front panel light so I do n't have to use as much of Magic Sculpt for the details . <h> You really nailed the lightsaber ! How did you go about recreating this particular Jedi 's signature weapon ? <p> I built the light saber out of a half round piece of acrylic and then frosted it . Fitting it into place I built a mount to hold it to the case and a sleeve that the base of it would fit into . I used some pieces of plastic I had left from the vacuum form for the eyes and sculpted the eye around them . I added the LED to the base of the lightsaber to give it a realistic look . <h> How did you achieve the level of detail for the rest of the Yoda build specifically ? <p> The feet were built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear sheet in the middle of 2 black sheets and cut them out on my chop saw . I sanded them down to 2000 grit and polished them up . To make them look even better I added green vinyl around the clear layer . This makes them look green even when it 's off . It also helps displace the light evenly . I also wired in some green led 's into the feet to really show them off . <p> Finally , using my vinyl plotter I re-badged just about everything . I sleeved and hand laced all the cables . All that was left , was to paint the PSU grill and the Mobo heat sinks . 
@@20827621 @827621/ <h> XCOM 2 Available Now : Liberate Humanity or Die Trying <p> The humans lost . Despite your valiant efforts in XCOM : Enemy Unknown , the free world fell under the might of the aliens and their minions . All that remains of your once mighty military are a few rag-tag resistance members , scrambling to gather basic resources and stay alive , much less stage a global-scale insurrection . And yet , that 's exactly what you 're tasked to do from the onset of XCOM 2 . And the situation only gets tenser , more desperate , and downright exciting as time goes on . <p> Just like the first XCOM , you 'll split your time in XCOM 2 amongst frenetic , turn-based combat , a strategic overlay of the earth , and performing research and upgrades back at your base . Except in XCOM 2 , your base is a flying alien carrier , called " appropriately enough " the Avenger . It 's here that the entirety of your dwindling forces call home , and it 's here that you 'll recruit fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design new gear . <p> To reinforce the desperate , lonesome nature of the current state of affairs , you start off with only a single territory , which is randomised whenever you begin a fresh game . From here , it 's up to you to expand out and establish communications with other resistance groups , scan for new supplies , and thwart alien progress such as Dark Events " enemy projects that , if left unchecked , have serious consequences , such as massive boosts to enemy powers or de-buffs to your friendly units . <p> Luckily , not everything is dire . While your numbers are weak , the skill and class-diversity of your troops most certainly is not . You can select up to five soldiers to send into combat , and there 's no requirement to take certain types of troopers ; you 're encouraged to try out different combinations to see which classes work best for you . Naturally though , each class has their battlefield advantages , and potential weaknesses . <p> The Grenadier specialises in area-of-effect explosives and taking out tech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot after moving , and the Sharpshooter is your long-distance damage-dealer , who can also be upgraded to be deadly at short range with pistols . There 's also the Specialist , who uses floating drones , and the Psi Operative , who relies on mental powers for squad buffs or attacking enemies . <p> Since the layout of every combat engagement is randomised ( as are the enemy troop placements ) , you 'll never fight the same battle twice , and you 'll need to constantly improvise and react to survive . The terrain and debris can be altered mid-fight as well , as the aliens can destroy cover . There are also advantages to taking the high ground , such as placing soldiers high up in multi-level buildings ; your squad can fall through burning floors though , which makes keeping them there a risky tactic . You can never get too comfy anywhere , because the AI is sharp , even on lower difficulties . A nice bonus is that you 'll always have a leg up on the alien scum from each mission 's starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an opponent 's line of sight , or take a shot at an enemy . This stealth aspect , when combined with overwatch " a setting you can enable on your soldiers to fire at anything that comes near them " can create some amazing ambushes , with devastating results . You can see a few missions on IGN that highlight this to great effect . <p> After emerging victorious , or at least coming out of a mission without getting all your team members slaughtered , you 'll sometimes pick up loot drops , including weapon upgrades . These items , like the majority of XCOM 2 , are randomised , and can range from rare gun components to high-powered ammunition . If you keep your soldiers alive , they 'll also level up periodically , which unlocks new traits and specializations to choose from . However , if one of your high-level troops bites the dust , all their progress will be lost , and they 'll have to be replaced with a raw , new recruit . <p> Taking full advantage of the PC platform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 's developers ) , there are already some mods available . These mods come from Long War Studios , who worked on XCOM : Enemy Unknown 's incredibly successful Long War tweaks . The day-one mods include adding sub-machine guns , unlockable leadership perks , and an extra alien combatant : the Muton Centurion . " The idea behind each of these mods , " reports Eurogamer , " is players can pick and choose which ones to enable , and create a campaign that suits them best . It reminds me somewhat of the Second Wave options we saw added to the previous game . " <p> Firaxis has made it clear that they consider modding an integral part of PC gaming , and they 're excited to see how people will tweak XCOM 2 . " We 're going all-out with modding , " said Creative Director Jake Solomon in an interview . " Because we 're a Firaxis game , we 're committed to this idea of player value . We want our players to play our games forever , and so we want to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want people to talk , to communicate with us , and for our games to have this really long life cycle , because that increases the value of our games . " <p> Being a PC-exclusive game , Firaxis capitalized on the power of the hardware by including a whole host of graphics settings , which you can manipulate to your heart 's desire . These include multiple levels of anti-aliasing , ambient occlusion , shadow quality , texture filtering , depth of field , and more . With a GeForce GTX graphics card , such as the screaming fast GTX 980 Ti , you can take full advantage of the next-generation Maxwell technology and crank the game 's settings , making XCOM 2 even more gorgeous than ever .

That trend will continue on January 24th with the launch of Capcom 's Resident Evil 7 : Biohazard , the latest entry in the storied franchise . Resident Evil 7 : Biohazard takes place about four years after Resident Evil 6 , and everything unfolds in the same universe as all the games before it . But while some of the previous Resident Evil titles focused heavily on gun-play and twitch-based skill , Resident Evil 7 : Biohazard instead hones in on the roots of survival-horror : exploration , interspersed but visceral battles , apprehension , and inventory management . <p> Additionally , you 're not a trained operative in the BSAA ( Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance ) , or a member of S.T.A.R.S .

From early on , you 're stalked and hunted by Jack Baker , the family patriarch . He 's relentless in his pursuit , and he does n't care about causing destruction in his efforts to apprehend you . He smashes tables to bits if they get in the way , and he 'll even bash through walls to surprise and ambush your character . You 've got to constantly stay on guard , or risk suffering a nasty demise . <p> Despite lacking a super-hero status , you are n't defenseless , and there 's still a good amount of combat you 'll take part in . You have access to various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in-between , but you wo n't blast apart everything you see . This game is a more subtle , creepy experience than that . As confirmed by Eurogamer in an interview with Capcom Director Koushi Nakanishi , Resident Evil 7 : Biohazard is very much a return to the glory days of tension , fear , and vulnerability , and all from a glorious FPS perspective " a first for the main Resident Evil series . <p> Of course , there are plenty of aspects that long-time Resident Evil fans will recognize . For one , the EKG health meter and healing herbs are back . You 'll need to use herbs wisely to recover yourself after taking damage . Safe rooms make a return too , where you can take some much needed rest to save your progress and spend coins on equipment upgrades . You ca n't just carry around everything you find though .

For example , you 'll receive phone calls randomly from an unnamed source aiding you along the way . You 'll also stumble across old-fashioned VCR tapes here and there , and if you play them , you 'll be transported into their recorded events , taking part of the horror personally .

The graphics look especially awesome when played on a PC at higher resolutions , such as 2560 x 1440 or even 4K ( 3840 x 2160 ) . Adding to that , the PC version of Resident Evil 7 : Biohazard offers HDR support , so if you happen to own a next-gen HDR monitor ( or an HDR TV ) , you 're in for a treat .

@@20827636 @827636/ <h> GeForce Garage : How to Create a Nissan GT-R Mod <p> Some mods are so ridiculously cool , they stop you dead in your tracks when you see them . You ca n't help but stare in awe , and wonder just how in the heck their creators pulled them off . Kensuke Morita 's custom made Nissan GT-R R35 ( inspired by The Crew 's GT-R 34 ) definitely falls into that category . Morita has over a decade of modding experience under his belt , and he was employed by one of the most prestigious and famous Akihabara PC Parts shops in Japan . While there , he modded systems for public display such as a Soba PC made out of bamboo , a Nintendo Super Famicom , and a Game Boy . If you have n't done so already , watch the embeded video and then check out below to see what the GT-R R35 's guts are made of . <p> Morita typically uses a motherboard 's integrated VGA for modding , but doing that for the GT-R R35 would have been like sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose the very respectable GTX 970 . Built off NVIDIA 's Maxwell architecture , the 970 has no problem tackling today 's best games , and its power requirements are incredibly forgiving , which was a critical factor in getting this mod off the ground . For the GT-R R35 , Morita opted for Gigabyte 's GV-N970IXOC-4GD version of the card , as his custom case needed a powerful but smaller-sized GPU to work . <p> In keeping with the street racer theme , this modded rig houses a nitrous-fast Core i7-4790K processor " a quad-core LGA 1150 part that comes stock with a 4GHz clock , 8MB of L3 cache , and a max turbo frequency of 4.4GHz . Similar to the GTX 970 , the Core i7-4790K is n't a power hog , and its combination of performance and efficiency are a natural fit inside the GT-R R35 's elegant , curved chassis . This CPU crushes pretty much everything thrown at it , and it 's remarkably friendly to overclocking ( if , for some bizarre reason , the normal 4GHz is n't cutting it ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form-factor design , it makes a lot of sense that he went with a mini-ITX board . Do n't let the mobo 's tiny size fool you though , the ASUS H971-PLUS is no slouch when it comes to reliability and options . It supports DDR3 3200 RAM , SATA 6Gb/s , USB 3.0 , PCIe 3.0 ( Gen 3 ) , and M.2 10Gb/s data transfer . On top of that , the H971-PLUS offers a pretty slick fan-control GUI inside its user-friendly UEFI , which helps enthusiasts tweak their systems for precise cooling . The PCB 's rugged , industrial-inspired black and silver color scheme look right at home inside the GT-R R35 . <p> It would n't make much sense to try and jam a brick-sized HDD into the GT-R R35 's narrow interior , so Morita instead went with Intel 's 530 series SSD . In addition to saving on build space , bypassing a traditional hard drive makes cooling far easier to manage , which likely played an important role in this mod . The Intel 530 is plenty quick , too " up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 240GB of total system storage is n't exactly astronomical , it still leaves enough room for the OS and quite a few games . The cherry on top is that the Intel 530 only requires 195 mW of power under an active load , and 125 mW when idle . <h> Memory : 8GB Kingston DDR3-1600 <p> It 's all about keeping things as compact and productive as possible under that GT-R R35 's plastic body , and Kingston 's DDR3-1600 sticks were probably a shoe-in because of that . Both modules rest snug and out of the way under the mobo 's attached 24-pin power cable . Despite their unassuming appearance , these sticks operate at 1.5V and give the system 8GB of total memory , with a peak data rate of 12.8GB/s . Using under 12 gigs of memory in a gaming box is far from overkill , but Kingston makes some of the most trustworthy and cost-effective RAM in the business . These sticks are certainly no exception to that . <p> Tying the whole mod together is a small form factor ( SFX ) power supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't even in the ballpark , thanks to the car 's cramped space ) . Despite its miniature status , this 550W part has enough juice to keep all the other components cranking . However , according to Morita , installing the SFX PSU was still the most complex and challenging part of the build . In the end , he had to manually shorten each of the modular power cords so they 'd all fit properly . In addition , the PSU acts as an integral part of the chassis , connecting directly to the rear wheels and the 1.5mm steel plates underneath the body . <p> Kensuke Morita 's GT-R R35 is a magnificent combination of ingenuity , utility , and beauty . With an NVIDIA GTX 970 rumbling inside , you know it 's ready for anything . After you 're done ogling at the mod ( it 's okay to be entranced by it ) , be sure to check out GeForce Garage , where you can learn how to make some stand-out PC mods of your own .

The external faces of the case needed to look like steel in order to make the rust look believable . So I lightly scuffed the plastics with a Scotchbrite pad , and randomly laid down 3-4 different shades of brown and rust red tones of paint . <p> Then top coated all of that with a weathered steel paint from Rust-o-leum . <p> After that , I created damage to the case by taking a hammer and chisel/punch to the steel side panel to create the effect of something like a pipe may have blown up near it and struck the machine . <p> Since the front corners are plastic bezel , I could n't take the same approach and had to use a heat gun and a rubber mallet . <h> That took care of the first two points . What about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component ( The lightening bolt in the " O " of the Fallout logo ) while attempting to make it look like it was a functional part of the machine . I took that lightening bolt and turned it into focal point of the mod . <p> I carved the lightening bolt out of 1.25 inch thick clear acrylic , using a combination of a table saw , belt sander and block sanders . I then routed out a depression in the back of the bolt , in order to embed 6 LED lights . This made the bolt glow with a warm white light . I then gave it 5-6 coats of window frosting , in order to diffuse the light produced . <p> I then cut the front grille to allow the lightening bolt to push through it , making it look like it was exploding through the front . Now , I think it look as if the computer was actually being powered by the lightening bolt itself . <h> What other details did you add ? <p> The graphics that I put on the case are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet printer , cut to size , and sprayed with a matte clear to lock in the colors to the decal . Then I scuffed them up a bit with the Scotchbrite pad and applied more rust treatment make everything appear to have age equally , <p> I even added an old school display from Alphacool above the lightening bolt . Once a USB driver is installed , the display will light up and cycle through multiple status screens .

Materials can also be acquired from shops , giving players yet another opportunity to spend the Florins acquired from gameplay and the buy-upgrade-enhance city mechanic that 's so popular .

@@20827660 @827660/ <h> YIDIY : Dewayne Carel 's Fallout Rig <p> We just recently concluded our Fallout 4 Radiation Check Contest where the winners will get to take home tons of Fallout 4 swag . However , the ultimate prize - the incredible Fallout themed modded PC pictured above - goes only to the lucky person in first place . <p> Created by Dewayne Carel of Modders Inc. , it 's not only capable of playing Fallout 4 but it looks like it came right out of the game itself . We last saw Dewayne when he stopped by GeForce Garage to give us some tips on how to paint your case . We caught up with him to get some details on the rig , what techniques he used to make it look so awesome and what brilliant idea he 's working on next . Thumbs Up ! <h> Fallout 4 <h> Tell us a little about the background of this rig ? <p> The mod was originally built in 2013 for the Modders-Inc. staff vs staff contest the we do each year . Part of the challenge is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mods and have a budget of only $250 . I believe I came really close to the spending limit as I had to purchase a molded PIP Boy and some analog gauges . When we 're done we show them off at our booth during the US Case Modding Championship case mod contest that we host at QuakeCon . <p> Click on image to enlarge . <p> The theme we picked that year was any game created by either i 'd or Bethesda . After looking at the listing of games , Fallout stood about to me as it had a look that I have not created before for a case mod . Believe it or not I had never played any of the Fallout games when I picked it as the theme . I knew I had to add items to the case that people would recognized from the game so I got the game and started to play it , thus the case was born . <h> What have you done with it since then ? <p> Click on image to enlarge . <p> Let 's see , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QuakeCon twice , featured in a video by Tek Syndicate and other websites , and featured on countless websites over the past two years . The last show that it was at was the 2015 Intel IDF conference on the main stage during the gaming session . <h> What upgrades have you done to make it ready for Fallout 4 ? <p> Click on image to enlarge . <p> To bring the hardware up to today 's standard I replaced most of the hardware to make it Fallout 4 ready . This included a 500GB Crucial SSD , 16GB of Kingston Hyper-X DDR4 RAM , Gigabyte GA-Z170X motherboard , Intel i5-6600K CPU , and of course Fallout 4 Edition GeForce GTX 970 video card from EVGA . This gives the Fallout mod more than enough power to play the Fallout 4 game . <h> Speak about all the different design elements that tie it back to the Fallout franchise <p> Click on image to enlarge . <p> I wanted the case to look like it really was from the game and not just a representation of the Fallout world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched the case - and they did that a lot- that the uneven paint , dirt , switches , dials , and accessories had the right feel and looked like it should be there . The side case window was a no brainer as I turned it into the terminal that you have to hack into from the game . I used some of the actual code that is displayed on the terminal screen in the game along with some other stuff that the winner of the case will see . <p> Click on image to enlarge . <p> The idea was that the PC was back in the vault or wherever you where staying and when you went back there your habit was to take the bottle caps out of your pockets and then removed the PIP Boy and placed them on top of your PC . The Thermaltake Urban S41 was the case used while the Thermaltake keyboard , mouse and headphones had to be part of the mod as you need each of those to have functional PC . Of course those that to be painted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . <h> What modding techniques/steps did you use to get it to look this awesome ? <p> The chipped paint and rust techniques was something I had to learn to do this case which gave it the realistic look/feel I wanted . Layers of different colour browns and tans where slackly applied all over the case . Hairspray was applied to the areas where I wanted the paint to come off at , then I applied the machine grey top coat and let it all dry . When you take water and apply it where the hairspray was added it will dissolve the hairspray and allow you rub and scratch off the top coat revealing the browns and tans making it look like the exposed metal had become rusted . Another techniques that is easy to do was creating the dust effect . Again two different colors of brown where used and sprayed into the air and let it fall naturally , like dust or dirt , onto the items . <h> Why do you enjoy modding so much ? Tell us a little about Modders Inc . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked that question many time and I pretty much answer the same way each time ... I tell people that it is a way of self expression . I have always had some artistic abilities and when I got in computers I found that I could pass on that fun into PC modding . With case modding you get to show something about your personality and stuff you like . This is the reason Modders-Inc.com was created . We wanted to help people learning about PC case modding and to show them that you do not need to spend a lot of money to create something special and to have fun with . The Modders-Inc team is made up of some of the best modders and hardware product reviewer to help you pick the right hardware for your PC and how to make it look the way you want it too . <h> Are you sad to see your baby go ? <p> Click on image to enlarge . <p> Sad ... yes . Truthfully I have never gotten attached to any case mod I have done and it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , but this one found a place in my heart . I think because I mostly done this mod for myself and the Modders-Inc website . But instead of being stingy and holding on to it I thought it would be best to allow someone else enjoy the Fallout mod ( please send me a picture with you with the case ) and have fun playing Fallout on a Fallout case mod . <h> What 's next on the plate for you ? <p> I have a few things on my plate that I want to do such as making sure that Modders-Inc grows in the right direction for case modders and hardware enthusiast . Maybe someday create a ModCon where case modders , game modders , and fans get together for a big ass LAN . On a more personal goal for modding there has been this project that I need to finish up that I start A Long Time Ago , in a Galaxy Far , Far Away ...

@@20827662 @827662/ <h> GeForce Experience 1.8.2 Adds Advanced Controls For ShadowPlay Beta <p> Since its first beta release last October , NVIDIA ShadowPlay has quickly become the most exciting and talked about feature of GeForce Experience .

Recently , we also added microphone support and the ability to broadcast direct to Twitch . <p> The release of GeForce Experience 1.8.2 today adds several highly requested features to ShadowPlay Beta , further improving its capabilities . <p> First and foremost , a new option in ShadowPlay 's Quality dropdown enables customisation of the capture resolution , the capture frame rate , and the capture bit rate , giving you greater control over capture output .

To retain the same quality level whilst also reducing frame rates from 60 fps to 30 fps , reduce the bit rate by half . This will keep quality per frame the same while reducing the file size . <p> ShadowPlay Beta 's new options are accessed via the Quality button in the ShadowPlay control panel . <p> In a prior release we expanded audio capture to include microphone input . In GeForce Experience 1.8.2 , " push-to-talk " is enabled via a user-definable microphone toggle for those wanting to add the occasional comment to their recordings . <p> We 've also looked into the issue of ShadowPlay Beta 's write impact on solid state drives ( SSDs ) .

But for extra peace of mind , the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file location .

And now on desktops and laptops , Shadow Warrior 2 performance can be improved by up to 30% with MRS , enabling you to play at 4K at over 60 FPS on a GeForce GTX 1080 , with max settings enabled , or at over 60 FPS at 2560x1440 on a GTX 1060 , also with max settings enabled . <p> Click to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and select PC titles , but only Multi-Res Shading leaves the focal point of the screen at the player 's selected rendering resolution , retaining maximum image quality where your eyes are focused .

And everything rendered within that border is shown at 60% resolution ( 40% lower than the selected screen resolution ; for example , images inside the MRS viewports are rendered at 2304x1296 when 3840x2160 is the selected screen rendering resolution ) . In pictorial form , it works like this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the screen resolution specified in the options of a game , we recommend MRS be used at higher resolutions like 2560x1440 and 3840x2160 ( 4K ) . During gameplay the reduced resolution of the MRS border is far less noticeable at 2560x1440 , and nigh on unnoticeable at 4K . This is especially true in Shadow Warrior 2 , a fast and furious game where you ca n't take your eyes off the center of the screen due to the non-stop action .

Similarly , particle effects are used by developers to connect players to the game world and show that the character under the player 's control is physically affecting , or being affecting by these other elements . Without particles , scene elements wo n't interact with one another or the world . As an example , imagine a mini-gun that cut down enemies without any muzzle flash , ejected casings , smoke , or steam from the red hot barrel . With particles in a non-PhysX accelerated title the aforementioned items would appear in a uniform fashion " the casings would always spew out in a particular arc regardless of the character 's stance or movement speed , and the smoke and steam would be static . <p> By incorporating PhysX Particles , not only can the developer include significantly more effects , they can also simulate those effects accurately . In the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissipates and is manipulated by the environment realistically , and the particles and embers from her pepper-themed projectiles accurately cast around the weapon before making their descent towards the ground . In general , by incorporating simulated particles Alice 's attacks become far more visceral and the world more immersive , and even though the previously mentioned goop fluid effect can emit up to 10,000 particles alone , there is more than enough horsepower left in the GPU to simultaneously accelerate thousands more . Additionally , these particles conform to the same collision standards as the goop particles , meaning they collide and interact with the environment and objects accurately , and therefore do not move or clip through scene elements , or vanish through the floor as in other games . <p> As Alice strafes to the right the smoke from her Pepper Grinder Gun spreads across the environment and is subsequently dissipated as she moves left once more . See this particular example in action in the video on page one . <p> As you can see in the accompanying video and images , the shields of Mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice 's Pepper Grinder gun , and showers of debris litter scenes when enemies are destroyed . More subtly , particles are used for leaves in forests , bubbles in whimsical areas , dust motes , floating embers , and to enhance the feathers , butterflies and smoke that appear when Alice double-jumps . <p> With PhysX enabled there are significantly more objects surrounding Alice as she performs a double-jump , each of which will float away realistically . <p> A Mad Cap 's shield disintegrates into hundreds of pieces and particles after several blows from Alice 's deadly Hobby Horse . <p> Enemies , like the Mad Cap above , emit extra particles during their attacks and explode into extra pieces when clobbered to death by Alice , Alice 's own physical attacks appear more deadly and powerful with the addition of extra particles , and explosions and magically-powered barriers are enhanced further .

With increased performance and efficiency , the GT 700M GPUs were perfect for multimedia applications and entry-level gaming . Today , we- 're unveiling our new GeForce GTX 700M notebook GPUs , each of which utilises our award-winning Kepler GPU architecture . With performance improvements of up to 55% compared to last year- 's gaming notebooks , GTX 700M GPUs are designed to give you max-quality graphics in the latest and greatest games , like Metro : Last Light . <p> Comprised of four new chips , each GTX 700M GPU includes the same advancements and innovations found in our latest GeForce GTX desktop GPUs , the GTX 780 and GTX 770 . That means unprecedented performance per Watt , the inclusion of GPU Boost 2.0 for maximum performance in every game , and full support for game-changing features like GeForce Experience . <p> GTX 700M notebook performance also benefits greatly from the launch of Haswell , Intel ' -s new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture , Haswell promises to improve CPU performance , and more importantly battery life , which is slated to increase by up to 50% . Combined with our own performance and efficiency improvements , and Optimus , GTX 700M Series notebooks will not only be the fastest gaming notebooks you- 've ever seen , but also the most portable and energy efficient . And when we say - " portable- " , we really do mean portable . <p> In the past , gaming notebooks were synonymous with big heavy desktop replacements . By dramatically increasing notebook GPU efficiency , notebook manufacturers can now fit high-performance GTX grade GPUs in sleek and slim form factors . Imagine owning a laptop that- 's light enough to carry around with you everywhere you go , but powerful enough to play all your favorite games at the highest settings . With the GTX 700M Series , we- 're making PC quality gaming more accessible than ever before . <h> GeForce GTX 700M Specifications <p> Specifications <p> GeForce GTX 780M <p> GeForce GTX 770M <p> GeForce GTX 765M <p> GeForce GTX 760M <p> CUDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Base Clock <p> 823 MHz + Boost <p> 811 MHz + Boost <p> 850 MHz + Boost <p> 657 MHz + Boost <p> Memory Configuration <p> Up to 4GB GDDR5 <p> Up to 3GB GDDR5 <p> Up to 2GB GDDR5 <p> Up to 2GB GDDR5 <p> Memory Clock <p> 2500 MHz <p> 2000 MHz <p> 2000 MHz <p> 2000 MHz <p> Memory Bandwidth <p> 160 GB/s <p> 96 GB/s <p> 64 GB/s <p> 64 GB/s <p> Memory Bus Width <p> 256-Bit <p> 192-Bit <p> 128-Bit <p> 128-Bit <h> GeForce GTX 780M Performance <p> The GeForce GTX 780M is our flagship mobile GPU , sporting 1536 CUDA Cores , up to 4GB of VRAM , a 256-bit memory bus , a 2500MHz Memory Clock , and a Base Clock of 823MHz that can Boost even higher . Combined , GTX 780M- 's changes and enhancements increase performance by 31% in comparison to the previous-generation GTX 680M . <p> With the GeForce GTX 780M , you- 'll be able to crank every setting to ultra in pretty much everything , giving you a no-holds barred gaming experience . <h> GeForce GTX 770M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , packing-in 960 CUDA Cores , up to 3GB of VRAM , a 192-bit memory bus , memory clocked to 2000MHz , and a Base Clock of 823MHz . Compared to its predecessor , performance increases by a massive 55% , allowing the latest games to be played at 1920x1080 at High-to-Ultra detail levels . <h> GeForce GTX 760M &amp; GTX 765M Performance <p> The GeForce GTX 760M and GeForce GTX 765M are our entry level GTX GPUs , capable of running the latest titles at high quality levels at 1920x1080 , or ultra at 1600x900 . These GPUs will give you the best balance of portability and power , whilst also delivering a level of visual fidelity far greater than you- 'll find on current-gen consoles . <p> Compared to its previous-generation GTX 600M Series counterpart , the GTX 760M nets gamers a performance improvement of 30% , and with the GTX 765M that gain increases yet further . As the chart above shows , this generational improvement enables every game in our test suite to run at over 30 frames per second at 1920x1080 . <h> Performance Summary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new GTX 700M chips is high enough to run the very latest games at Ultra and High levels of detail , making a GTX 700M notebook a viable alternative to a desktop PC . <p> Should you require even more performance , every GTX 700M GPU supports NVIDIA SLI configurations , increasing performance by up to 2x . Almost all big-name games have full SLI support come release thanks to our Game Ready drivers , and if not a profile will be delivered automatically through GeForce Experience's- update feature as soon as it ' -s ready for primetime . <h> GPU Boost 2.0 : Maximising Performance <p> Contributing to GTX 700M- 's sizeable performance gains is GPU Boost , a Kepler-exclusive feature that maximises frame rates in each and every game . Before GPU Boost , performance and power usage had to be capped to prevent overly-demanding synthetic benchmarks from damaging GPUs . With GPU Boost , this problem is solved by continuously monitoring and adjusting clock speeds and voltages , allowing GPUs to use every last ounce of performance in all applications and games , without exceeding safety or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and game runs at a guaranteed , minimum Base Clock speed on Kepler GPUs . If there-s extra power available a Boost Clock is enabled , increasing clock speeds until the graphics card hits its predetermined Power Target . This dynamic clock speed adjustment is controlled by GPU Boost 1.0 , which monitors a whole slew of data and makes real-time changes to speeds and voltages several times per second , maximising performance in each and every application . <p> GPU Boost 1.0 enabled GPU owners to direct all available power to game performance for the very first time . <p> Having acquired data from hundreds of thousands of end-users in the year following GPU Boost 1.0- 's introduction , NVIDIA ' -s engineers determined that GPU temperature was in fact a more common inhibitor to performance than power consumption . Subsequently , they developed GPU Boost 2.0 for desktop Kepler GPUs , and the latest Kepler notebook GPUs , like the GTX 700M chips we- 're announcing today . With GPU Boost 2.0 , Boost Clocks are increased until the GPU hits a Temperature Target set by the notebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capabilities of each model , and the level of available power ) . <p> GPU Boost 2.0 can be found in all GTX 700M-equipped notebooks , and is enabled automatically . <h> NVIDIA Optimus Technology : Maximising Battery Performance <p> While IGPs have historically delivered good battery life , they have consistently failed to deliver the graphics and GPU performance gamers demand . As a result , NVIDIA developed - " switchable graphics- " technology that allowed notebook users to choose which display adaptor would be used when a NVIDIA GPU was also present . In essence , this technology brought the best of both worlds , offering the battery life of an integrated graphics solution and the performance of a dedicated GPU . Unfortunately , there were limitations to the technology resulting in the end user having to execute a fairly involved procedure to harness the most from the platform , resulting in only 1% of users ever switching between the two graphics systems . <p> With the foundations of a great solution , NVIDIA engineers went back to the drawing board to develop a solution that combined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of use that the original solution lacked . The product of their labor was Optimus , a fully-automated solution that automatically , instantaneously , and seamlessly optimises battery life by dynamically switching between the IGP and dedicated NVIDIA GPU . <p> Optimus continually monitors the applications and games being used , and when it detects a program that in some way benefits from a dedicated GPU , the NVIDIA notebook GPU is powered up . Immediately after the application or game is closed , Optimus powers down the dedicated GPU and seamlessly switches the display back to the GPU , without flickering or resetting the system . <p> This automated solution gives notebook users maximum battery life when browsing the web , and maximum performance when saving the day in Metro : Last Light . It- 's a solution that -just works- , without the need for new profiles , and for that reason Optimus is now found in over 90% of available GeForce GTX-powered notebooks . <h> Game Ready Drivers : Maximising Frame Rates <p> On average , NVIDIA releases at least one new driver per month . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in most cases includes performance optimisations , day-zero enhancements for brand new games , and the latest SLI profiles for multi-GPU users . <p> A recent independent review of our driver program from renowned tech site HardOCP , determined that - " " 2012 was a good year for NVIDIA in terms of new video card releases , and driver support . " - " Continuing , the site ' -s senior editor said , - " " more often than not NVIDIA got its driver optimizations for games right the first time . This is something that buyers should take into consideration for any graphics card series . " - " <p> For HardOCP , and most gamers , day one support for the latest titles is key : " - " It is important to look back at the history , and support for new games as they are released . Most of you reading this are like us , we pre-order games , and start playing our brand new shiny game immediately when it unlocks in Steam . It is at that moment , at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimizations for these games on our video cards . We play these games as soon as they are launched , and day 1 game support is of most importance . We want drivers that optimize performance , and provide SLI support immediately . NVIDIA has a good track record for 2012 of providing this . " - " <p> In addition to the above , we- 've increased performance in dozens of titles , and introduced new SLI and 3D Vision profiles for even more . And should something go wrong , we- 've got support forums , feedback forms , and the Disqus threads here on GeForce.com , which are constantly monitored following a driver- 's release , ensuring any issues are tackled immediately . <h> GeForce Experience : The Easiest Way To Optimise Your Games <p> GeForce Experience is NVIDIA 's new application that can automatically keep GPU drivers up to date , and can optimise game settings with a single click , simplifying the process of getting the most from your PC , and from your games .

@@20827679 @827679/ <h> Introducing The GeForce GTX 680 GPU <h> From Fermi to Kepler <p> Every two years or so , NVIDIA engineers set out to design a new GPU architecture . The architecture defines a GPU 's building blocks , how they 're connected , and how they work . The architecture is the basis not just for a single chip but a family of chips that serves a whole spectrum of systems , from high performance PCs to wafer thin notebooks , from medical workstations to supercomputers . It is the blueprint for every NVIDIA GPU for the next two years . <p> Just over two years ago , NVIDIA launched the Fermi architecture with the GeForce GTX 480 . Named after the Italian nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi , this new architecture brought two key advancements . First , it brought full geometry processing to the GPU , enabling a key DirectX 11 technique called tessellation with displacement mapping . Used in games such as Battlefield 3 and Crysis 2 , this technique greatly improves the geometric realism of water , terrain , and game characters . Second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and today , Fermi GPUs power three out of the top five supercomputers in the world . <p> Today , NVIDIA is launching Kepler , the much anticipated successor to the Fermi architecture . With Kepler we wanted not only to build the world 's fastest GPU , but also the world 's most power efficient . Feature wise , we added new technologies that fundamentally improve the smoothness of each frame and the richness of the overall experience . <h> Why Is Power Efficiency Important ? <p> When we first launched Fermi with the GeForce GTX 480 , people told us how much they loved the performance , but they also told us they wished it consumed less power . Gamers want top performance , but they want it in a quiet , power efficient form factor . The feedback we received from Fermi really drove this point home . With Kepler , one of our top priorities was building a flagship GPU that was also a pleasure to game with . <p> Kepler introduces two key changes that greatly improve the GPU 's efficiency . First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building block of our GPUs , for optimal performance per watt . Second , we added a feature called GPU Boost that dynamically increases clock speed to improve performance within the card 's power budget . <p> Kepler 's new SM , called SMX , is a radical departure from past designs . SMX eliminates the Fermi " 2x " processor clock and uses the same base clock across the GPU . To balance out this change , SMX uses an ultra wide design with 192 CUDA cores . With a total of 1536 cores across the chip , the GeForce GTX 680 handily outperforms the GeForce GTX 580 . <p> The GeForce GTX 680 GPU is made up of 3.54 billion transistors . The entire chip has been designed for optimal performance per watt . <p> But what 's benefited the most is power efficiency . Compared to the original Fermi SM , SMX has twice the performance per watt . Put another way , given a watt of power , Kepler 's SMX can do twice the amount of work as Fermi 's SM . And this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conventional 50 watt light bulb that shines as brightly as a 100 watt light bulb " that 's what Kepler 's like when gaming . <p> The GeForce GTX 680 is significantly more power efficient than its predecessor . For the gamer , this translates into a cooler , quieter experience , and less overall power draw . <p> The benefit of this power improvement is most obvious when you plug in a GeForce GTX 680 into your system . If you 've owned a high end graphics card before , you 'll know that it requires an 8-pin and 6-pin PCI-E power connector . With the GTX 680 , you need just two 6-pin connectors . This is because the card draws at most 195 watts of power , compared to 244 watts on the GeForce GTX 580 . If there ever was a middle weight boxer that fought like a heavy weight that would be the GeForce GTX 680 . <h> GPU Boost <p> SMX doubled the performance per watt , but what if the GPU was n't actually using its full power capacity ? Going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watt light bulb was sometimes running at 90 watts , or even 80 watts ? - As it turns out , that 's exactly how GPUs behave today . <p> The reason for this is actually pretty simple . Like light bulbs , GPUs are designed to operate under a certain wattage . This number is called the thermal design point , or TDP . For a high-end GPU , the TDP has typically been about 250 watts . You can interpret this number as saying : this GPU 's cooler can remove 250 watts of heat away from the GPU . If it goes over this limit for an extended period of time , the GPU will be forced to throttle down its clock speed to prevent overheating . What this also means is , to get the maximum performance , the GPU should operate close to its TDP , without ever exceeding it . <p> In reality , GPUs rarely reach their TDP when playing even the most intensive 3D games . This is because different games consume different amounts of power and the GPU 's TDP is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 or Crysis 2 consume far less power than a GPU 's TDP rating . Only a few synthetic benchmarks can push GPUs to their TDP limit . <p> For example , say your GPU has a TDP of 200 watts . What this means is that in the worst case , your GPU will consume 200 watts of power . If you happen to be playing Battlefield 3 , it may draw as little as 150 watts . In theory , your GPU could safely operate at a higher clock speed to tap into this available headroom . But since it does n't know the power requirements of the application ahead of time , it sticks to the most conservative clock speed . Only when you quit the game does it reduce to a lower clock speed for the desktop environment . <p> GPU Boost changes all this . Instead of running the GPU at a clock speed that is based on the most power hungry app , GPU Boost automatically adjusts the clock speed based on the power consumed by the currently running app . To take our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaving performance on the table , GPU Boost will dynamically increase the clock speed to take advantage of the extra power headroom . <p> Different games use different amounts of power . GPU Boost monitors power consumption in realtime and increases the clock speed when there 's available headroom . <h> How It Works <p> The most important thing to understand about GPU Boost is that it works through real time hardware monitoring as opposed to application based profiles . As an algorithm , it attempts to find what is the appropriate GPU frequency and voltage for a give moment in time . It does this by reading a huge swathe of data such as GPU temperature , hardware utilization , and power consumption . Depending on these conditions , it will raise the clock and voltage accordingly to extract maximum performance within the available power envelop . Because all this is done via realtime hardware monitoring , GPU Boost requires no application profiles . As new games are released , even if you do n't update your drivers , GPU Boost " just works . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outputs the optimal GPU clock and voltage . Currently it does not alter memory frequency or voltage though it has the option to do so . <h> How Much Boost ? <p> Because GPU Boost happens in realtime and the boost factor varies depending on exactly what 's being rendered , it 's hard to pin the performance gain down to a single number . To help clarify the typical performance gain , all Kepler GPUs with GPU Boost will list two clock speeds on its specification sheet : the base clock and the boost clock . The base clock equates to the current graphics clock on all NVIDIA GPUs . For Kepler , that 's also the minimum clock speed that the GPU cores will run at in an intensive 3D application . The boost clock is the typical clock speed that the GPU will run at in a 3D application . <p> For example , the GeForce GTX 680 has a base clock of 1006 MHz and a boost clock of 1058 MHz . What this means is that in intensive 3D games , the lowest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time , it 'll likely run at around 1058 MHz . It wo n't run exactly at this speed--based on realtime monitoring and feedback , it may go higher or lower , but in most cases it will run close to this speed . <p> GPU Boost does n't take away from overclocking . In fact , with GPU Boost , you now have more than one way to overclock your GPU . You can still increase the base clock just like before and the boost clock will increase correspondingly . Alternatively , you can increase the power target . This is most useful for games that are consuming near 100% of this power target . <h> Genuinely Smoother Gameplay <p> Despite the gorgeous graphics seen in many of today 's games , there are still some highly distracting artifacts that appear in gameplay despite our best efforts to suppress them . The most jarring of these is screen tearing . Tearing is easily observed when the mouse is panned from side to side . The result is that the screen appears to be torn between multiple frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggravated when the framerate is high since a large number of frames are in flight at a given time , causing multiple bands of tearing . <p> An example of screen tearing in Battlefield 3 . <p> Vertical sync ( V-Sync ) is the traditional remedy to this problem , but as many gamers know , V-Sync is n't without its problems . The main problem with V-Sync is that when the framerate drops below the monitor 's refresh rate ( typically 60 fps ) , the framerate drops disproportionately . For example , dropping slightly below 60 fps results in the framerate dropping to 30 fps . This happens because the monitor refreshes at fixed internals ( although an LCD does n't have this limitation , the GPU must treat it as a CRT to maintain backward compatibility ) and V-Sync forces the GPU to wait for the next refresh before updating the screen with a new image . This results in notable stuttering when the framerate dips below 60 , even if just momentarily . <p> When V-Sync is enabled and the framerate drops below the monitor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With NVIDIA 's new Release 300 drivers , we are introducing a new option in the control panel called Adaptive V-Sync . Adaptive V-Sync combines the benefit of V-Sync while minimizing its downside . With Adaptive V-Sync , V-Sync is enabled only when the framerate exceeds the refresh rate of the monitor . When the framerate drops below this rate , V-Sync is automatically disabled , minimizing stuttering in games . <p> Adaptive V-Sync dynamically turns V-Sync on and off to maintain a more stable framerate . <p> By dynamically switching V-Sync on and off based on in-game performance , Adaptive V-Sync makes V-Sync a much more attractive option , especially for gamers who put a high premium on smooth framerates . <h> FXAA : Anti-Aliasing at Warp Speed <p> Nothing ruins a beautiful looking game like jaggies . They makes straight lines look crooked and generate distracting crawling patterns when the camera is in motion . The fix for jaggies is anti-aliasing , but today 's method of doing anti-aliasing is very costly to frame rates . To make matters worse , their effectiveness at removing jaggies has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make use of a form of antialiasing called multi-sample anti-aliasing ( MSAA ) . MSAA renders the screen at an extra high resolution then down samples the image to reduce the appearance of aliasing . The main problem with this is technique is that it requires a tremendous amount of video memory . For example , 4x MSAA requires four times the video memory of standard rendering . In practice , a lot of gamers are forced to disable MSAA in order to maintain reasonable performance . <p> FXAA is a new way of performing antialiasing that 's fast , effective , and optimized for modern game engines . Instead of rendering everything at four times the resolution , FXAA picks out the edges in a frame based on contrast detection . It then smoothes out the aliased edges based on their gradient . All this is a done as a lightweight , post processing shader . <p> FXAA is not only faster than 4xMSAA , but produces higher quality results in game engines that make use of extensive post processing . Click here for an interactive comparison . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges . But unlike 4xMSAA , it consumes no additional memory and runs almost as fast as no antialiasing . FXAA has the added benefit that it works on transparent geometry such as foliage and helps reduce shader based aliasing that often appears on shiny materials. - <p> While FXAA is available in a handful of games today , with the R300 series driver , we 've integrated it into the control panel . This means you 'll be able to enable it in hundreds of games , even legacy titles that do n't support anti-aliasing . <h> TXAA : Even Higher Quality Than FXAA <p> Computer generated effects in films spend a huge amount of computing resources on ant-aliasing . For games to truly approach film quality , developers need new antialiasing techniques that bringing even higher quality without compromising performance . <p> With Kepler , NVIDIA has invented an even higher quality AA mode called TXAA that is designed for direct integration into game engines . TXAA combines the raw power of MSAA with sophisticated resolve filters similar to those employed in CG films . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher quality . <p> TXAA is available with two modes : TXAA 1 , and TXAA 2 . TXAA 1 offers visual quality on part with 8xMSAA with the performance similar to 2xMSAA , while TXAA 2 offers image quality that 's superior to 8xMSAA , with performance comparable to 4xMSAA . <h> NVIDIA Surround on a Single GeForce GTX 680 <p> Nothing is as thrilling as playing your favorite games across three monitors . At 5760 x 1080 , the expanded field of view fully engages your peripheral vision and provides a super immersive experience in racing and flight simulators . Previously , two NVIDIA GPUs were required to support three monitors . On Kepler , one card powers three monitors for gaming , with the option for a forth monitor for web or IM . <p> NVIDIA 's Kris Rey playing Skyrim across three monitors while referencing the Skyrim tweak guide on GeForce.com . <p> When three-monitor setups were first introduced , their cost was considered prohibitive . Today , you can buy a quality high definition panel for under $150 . Starting out from just one monitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system like the one above ( minus the accessory panel ) . And with a GeForce GTX 680 , you can power it from just a single graphics card . <p> A single GeForce GTX 680 is capable of playing most of today 's games across three 1080p monitors . For the most demanding titles , SLI is recommended . <p> In case you 're wondering , here are some real-world performance results from the GeForce GTX 680 , playing games across three 1080p monitors . As you can see , there is no skimping on quality here . Most of the games are being played at high quality , if not maximum . <h> Conclusion <p> The GeForce GTX 680 is quite unlike any flagship graphics card we 've ever built . We 've built the fastest GPU in the world for many generations now . With Kepler , we wanted to do more than just repeat that feat . <p> Kepler is really about starting from first principles and asking : beyond performance , how can we improve the gaming experience as a whole ? <p> Gamers told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more power efficient. - So we re-designed the architecture to do just that . The GeForce GTX 680 consumes less power than any flagship GPU since the GeForce 8800 Ultra , yet it outperforms every GPU we or anyone else have ever built . <p> We wanted to make gaming not just faster , but smoother . FXAA and the new TXAA does both . Games get super smooth edges without tanking the performance . <p> Adaptive V-Sync improves upon a feature that many gamers swear by . Now you can play with V-sync enabled and not worry about sudden dips in framerate . <p> Finally , a single GPU now powers a full NVIDIA Surround setup plus an accessory display . There is simply no better way to play a racing game or flight simulator . Add in NVIDIA PhysX technology , and the GTX 680 delivers an amazingly rich gaming experience . <p> Kepler is the outcome of over four years of research and development by some of the best and brightest engineers at NVIDIA . We hope you 'll have as much fun gaming on our new GPU as we had building it .

@@20827685 @827685/ <h> E3 2013 - The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt Developer Interview <p> When The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt comes out next year , Geralt of Rivia will reprise his role again as the titular character for the third time in the action role-playing series by CD Projekt RED . Not only will the game boast an open world area larger than any other modern RPG , the explorable area is thirty-five times larger than Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings . One of the many reasons I could n't wait to demo the game . <p> Upon arrival at the CD Projekt Red meeting rooms , I realized they had two problems on their hands . They had more beer than they could drink and not enough seats for one of the most highly demanded demos at E3 2013 . As we moved through the initial lobby area of the meeting rooms , we were funneled into a small theater where we were greeted with a gorgeous high gloss fact sheet , codes to play the previous Witcher games and a short survey to fill out after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted by Marek Ziemak , Gameplay Producer for The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt . As someone who played through The Witcher 2 three times ( One for each skill tree ) I entered the demo with a fair bit of skepticism . How could CDPR top what was one of my favorite games last year ? Marek wasted no time diving into a 45 minute demo showcasing the improvement in graphics , vastly increased scale and completely revamped combat animations . <p> We were handed this gorgeous fact sheet when we entered the meeting room . <p> The demo kicked off with a stunning CG trailer showing the protagonist Geralt doing what he does best , cashing in on Monster bounties . When Geralt arrives at the exchange point for payout on the bounty , he is presented with a difficult situation . The men who hired him are stringing up an innocent woman to be hung . At first Geralt does what all men who have a sense of self-preservation would do ; nothing . As he is riding away , Geralt 's conscience gets the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no point killing monsters if he allows himself to become one . Marek did n't specify which point of the game this demo starts at however he does state that it is n't the beginning . The fact that CDPR kicked off the demo putting Geralt in a moral juxtaposition is telling for the game . In the Witcher 2 Geralt did n't remember who is was or why he was on this journey . This led to a lot of moral ambiguity in the player 's decision making as you had no context ( Unless you played The Witcher ) as to who you are supposed to be . It seems that CDPR is setting us up for a powerful story with many tough choices for the player to make . <p> A life-sized statue of Geralt proudly showing off his E3 awards . <p> After the opening cinematic Marek took us through a series of quests showcasing the breadth of the world CDPR has painstakingly created . When I state that this game is F****** gorgeous , I mean it . The amount of geometry and detail packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scale in which it is delivered in makes the gameplay that we saw truly engrossing . When you combine that with the completely revamped combat animations and a few new moves ; you get a game with brutally fast combat that leaves you feeling truly powerful as a player . The few words that I have written does n't do the morsel of gameplay that I saw justice . This game is on the top of my radar for upcoming titles . <p> See what else Marek had to say about the third installment in the Witcher saga
