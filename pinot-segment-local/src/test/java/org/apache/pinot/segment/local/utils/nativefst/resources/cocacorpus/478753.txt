When to kiss , how many kisses , left cheek , right cheek , both cheeks , lips or not ? Have you ever greeted someone with a handshake and a cheery , " Hello " only to be surprised by an overbearing hug and a wet smooch on the lips ? Regions and cultures often dictate kissing rules , but the bottom line to the kissing dilemma is this : When in doubt , do n't  ! <p> In the business world , the corporate environment plays a significant part in our decision to kiss or not to kiss . Conservative fields , such as accounting and banking , may offer you a friendly handshake , while someone in the arts may offer you a cheek and outstretched arms once a comfortable relationship has been established . <p> Some things to consider before taking the plunge include how well you know the person , whether it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly affection . <p> The following are some general kissing rules .

The fabulous French seem to enjoy a kiss , more specifically twoonce on each cheekstarting on the left . <p> 2 . Most Italians are warm and demonstrative and particularly enjoy bestowing their kisses on close friends and family . <p> 3 . The Germans are more reserved and considered not as kiss-friendly as the Italians . While they do not object to kissing their family and close friends , a handshake is the best option when you are unsure of how to proceed . <p> 4 . Spunky Spaniards like the two-kiss rule , often starting with the right cheek and moving left . <p> 5 .

Although , the protocol in business is to shake hands , it is not uncommon to turn clients and colleagues into friends and family , so the clearly defined line often becomes murky . <p> General Rules For Kissing : <p> 1 .

If there is a problem , fix it . " <p> Whether the you and your spouse are in your first house or you have been in your neighborhood for awhile , keeping good relations with the neighbors can make a big difference in your quality of life .

Close your garage door . Avoid the habit of leaving it open because you plan on going back out in awhile . This is especially important if it 's messy . Not only is this a security issue , it 's also an issue of extending common courtesy to your neighbors who may not wish to regularly get an eyeful of your collection of boxes , garbage cans , etc . <p> 4 .

Or invite a few neighbors over for a backyard BBQ or potluck . Investing some time in getting to know the neighbors will help keep relationships harmonious and make it easier to handle any problems that arise . <p> 6 . Maintain your yard . At a minimum , meet the basic standards of yard maintenance by mowing , weed-whacking and doing your best to keep your yard looking decent . Hire someone if you ca n't seem to get it done yourself . Neighbors get cranky at the thought of their property values going down because of a slob next door . <p> 9 . Be a good driver . Do n't treat the neighborhood streets as your personal racetrack .

Your neighbors should n't associate your comings and goings with a thumping bass and rattling windows . <p> 10 . Discuss problems in person . If a problem arises , talk to your neighbor in person first . Approach the situation in a pleasant way , " You may not have realized this , but ... " Start here rather than resorting to a nasty note or a call to the police that will be sure to permanently strain your relationship . Also , use good judgment in identifying real problems : a party on a special occasion is one thing ; a continuous stream of parties that interfere with your sleep on a regular basis is another . 113805 @qwx733805

" <p> In my marriage counseling practice , Ive seen a myriad of presenting issues and relationship styles . A common thread running through many of these couples is a sincere desire for change leading to a more secure , fulfilling and loving relationship . The problems include such things as poor communication , a build-up of resentment , trust violations due to infidelity , dissatisfaction with roles , changes in expectations , relationship imbalances and more . <p> What I ca n't help but taking note of when having conversations about what does n't  work well in relationships , is what does work if given the opportunity .

They enjoy spending time together and there is mutual respect . <p> 2 . Humor : Spouses who can make each other laugh tend to be good at de-escalating conflicts when they do arise . Couples who have the ability to lighten up a tense moment have a big advantage in that they are able to lighten the mood quickly and possibly derail conflict . The use of funny nicknames can be an indicator of great fondness for one another . The names often stem from a " you had to be there " moment from the beginning of their relationship . <p> 3 .

Chore Sharing : Those who divvy up the household or parenting responsibilities in a way that is mutually agreed upon are less likely to hold resentments about what they perceive as " unfair . " Each participates and contributes to the marriage in this way . <p> 5 . Sexual Intimacy : Couples who have their sexual needs met or at least have negotiated a reasonable compromise , if their levels of need are n't  compatible , feel taken care of by the other . Some are highly active , engaging in lovemaking multiple times a week and others are content with far less . There is no " right " or " wrong " here , but if one person is feeling their needs are n't  being met its important to talk about it . <p> 6 .

His " four horsemen of the apocalypse " are criticism , contempt , defensiveness and stonewalling . He has shown that couples who demonstrate a high level of " the horsemen " in their relationships are more likely to divorce . <p> 8 . Mutual and Separate Friends : Partners who socialize with other couples and also maintain separate friendships have greater balance in regards to honoring themselves as individuals within the marriage .

" <p> Deciding to start a family is very exciting , but it can also be filled with anxiety and ambivalence . It is basically a dive into the unknown . It truly is the only major irreversible decision you and your spouse will ever make in each others life . <p> Based on my own experiences , as well as those of countless couples I have counseled over the past 20 years , I have come up with a list of issues to think about and come to terms with prior to starting lifes next adventure . <p> 1 . Are you and your spouse on the same page ? You both need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child at this particular time . You need to be emotionally ready . You need to consider if you and your significant other feel secure enough in your relationship to become parents . <p> Are you satisfied with most parts of your life and your relationshipenough to take on this new role ? Some hesitation and ambivalence are normal but if you are feeling turmoil , it may mean that this is not the right moment . You may need to figure out what else needs to happen or get resolved . <p> 2 . Are you ready financially ? Having a child carries with it many new expenses . Do you need to move to a bigger apartment or house ? Another important consideration is whether you will be a one income or two-income family . This is an issue that can potentially create conflict and one that both of you must be in total agreement about with not much wiggle room after the baby comes . There are pros and cons to both arrangements , but the main issue is that you are on the same page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue that is related to this one is how raising a child will effect your career(s) . You must be very realistic about this and really give it a lot of consideration . All this depends on whether one or both of you will continue to work , what will be the hours , is there flexibility , maternity/paternity leaves , the possibility and reality of promotions , etc . <p> 3 . Making things work on a daily basis . It is important to talk to other new parents to try to realistically picture what life will be like day to day . It is totally impossible to think of all possibilities , but if for example , you opt to be a stay-at-home mom , are you going to be lonely ? How will you feel about being home with a baby all day , how will you have time to exercise , get your manicures and hair done ? What about drinks with friends ? Are you going to feel resentful doing all the household chores ? If you will be working , how will household chores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your spouse or would you rather delegate all or some of these to the person taking care of your child ? <p> 4 . Time alone with your spouse . This is the topic I feel most strongly about . Having a baby means that your relationship with your spousenow , more then evermust become a priority . Yes , that 's right . Most of us are aware of the multitude of problems that come into a marriage with the arrival of the little one . Please remember that your relationship with your spouse is of the utmost importance and a good marriage is the best thing you can do for your child . That means you must create time and space for just the two of you . Whether it means a few hours after the baby goes to sleep , or asking an in-law to watch the baby so you can step out for a bite . Or even leaving the baby with a trusted grandparent or babysitter for a weekend away . <p> 5 . Dealing with the uncertainty and surprises of being a parent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For those with major control issues , this really is the most challenging part of being a parent . Some women try to control the baby by obsessing what they eat and drink while pregnant , trying to figure out what kind of childbirth experience they want to have , etc . All this is well and good , but the fact remains that this is the most unpredictable experience you will have starting from pregnancy , childbirth and certainly all that comes after . <p> There is no way to anticipate how you will feel when your child is born , when you see the first smile , step , hear the first word . There are also the potentially difficult trials and challenges along the way that no prenatal testing can predict .

If you do n't  trust partner , for instance , you 're more likely to be frustrated , anxious , depressed , angry , sad , preoccupied , tense and the list goes on and on .

@@79604661 @1104661/ <p> Though we want to believe that proper hygiene is something that comes naturally , its a learned behavior and not something kids automatically pick up . Its up to us as their parents to teach them . <p> When I was 12 , I came home from school one day to find a stick of deodorant , a sports bra and a pile of pads on my bedroom dresser . That was the extent of information I received about puberty from my parents . <p> To them , talking about hygiene , menstruation and bodily changes was just too awkwardso they did n't  . Awkward myself ( but equally curious ) , I spent the next few years looking to other sourcesmagazines , TV shows , textbooks and my friends , to know how to handle the hair on my legs and smell under my arms . <p> Let 's be clear . Though I did manage to take care of myself , this was n't a great way to learn . As parents , we have a divine responsibility to educate our children . No one wants their son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to setting our kids up for a reputation that could eventually hurt their self-esteem ( not to mention the health implications ) , creating bad hygiene habits now will only lead to bad hygiene habits later . <p> So sit down with your preteen and talk about the basics . Even if he or she is n't showing signs of puberty just yet , now is the time to start teaching healthy habits . <p> Education and Expectations <p> To kids , hygiene can seem like a hassle . Lather , rinse , and repeat ... every day ? No thanks ! From the beginning , explain to your child why each grooming process is necessary and then set clear expectationslike using soap every time they shower or clipping nails every Sunday . To get started it may be helpful to have a personalized daily routine hygiene checklist for them . <p> Bathing : While elementary-aged children may only bathe once or twice a week , tweens and teens should bathe once daily , as well as after swimming or sports , the American Academy of Dermatology recommends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time limit ( such as five to 10 minutes ) . Provide a mild soap , and encourage your child to focus on washing their hands , feet , face and crotch . <p> Hair treatment : While bathing every day is a must , hair washing every day is n't . Constant washing can strip hair of its natural oils , making it prone to breakage . New York City hairstylist Jeff Chastain told The New York Times that most people should only shampoo once or twice a week . Help your child decide how often to wash his or her hair based on their activity , sweat levels and type of hair . According to Chastain , those with straight hair usually need to shampoo more often and those with curly hair need to shampoo less often . In between washings , encourage children to use conditioner and possibly a dry shampoo . <p> Shaving : Explain to your child that its common for guys to shave their faces and girls to shave their legs and armpits . Theyve probably seen you or your spouse do it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razor burn , provide your teen with a shaving cream or lathery soap and coach them through the first time . Remind them that because its easy to nick themselves with a razor , they should never share with a friend or family member . <p> Deodorant : Sweat itself is odorless , but when combined with bacteria found on the skin it can begin to smell . Its possible your child does n't  notice their own smell or does n't  realize others can smell it . Because of this , once a child hits age 10 or so , its essential to start applying deodorant daily . Explain that deodorant can help mask the smell , and some deodorants , called antiperspirants , can even prevent sweating . ChildrensMD.org suggests Secret Clinical Strength for girls and Old Spice Sweat Defense for males . They both offer strong protection with a youthful scent . <p> Skin care : Different skin types require different care . Help your child identify their type to know how to best care for it . There are three general categories of skin types : dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine pores , a matte appearance and is drier toward the sides of the face . Use warm water instead of hot for this type of skin , and be generous with moisturizer . <p> * Sensitive skin feels dehydrated and can be itchy and red . For this type , or for skin prone to eczema , try a product like CLn SportWash , which can reduce the appearance of skin redness , drying and flakiness . <p> * Oily skin usually features blemishes and blackheads . For this type , facial cleansers and blotting papers work best . <p> Your child may have a combination of these skin types . A dermatologist is most qualified to help identify which type of skin they have and how to best approach cleaning and treatment . <p> Oral care : The American Dental Association recommends brushing your teeth twice a daymorning and nightwith fluoride toothpaste . Doing so removes food and plaque , which can cause gum diseases and bad breath . Make brushing his teeth ( and flossing ! ) part of your tweens daily routine by encouraging it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . <p> Nail clipping : Grime can get under finger and toe nails , harboring germs and making hands appear dirty . Consider taking your son or daughter to get a professional manicure or pedicurejust to see how much effort is put into cleaning the hands , feet and nails . Moving forward , set a specific day each week for your child to do their own nail trimming . <p> Changing clothes : Putting on clean clothes , including socks and underwear , is an essential part of every day . Clothes not only retain body odor , but also strong external smells like pungent foods . If your child wears a school uniform , remind them to hang it up so it can air out between washings . <p> Body changes : Puberty can bring dramatic changes , but not overnight . Prepare your son or daughter for menstruation , voice changes , new emotions and more . Remember , children will follow their parents cues , so speak directly and avoid any euphemisms . <p> Respect Their Privacy <p> Some children will be open and curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkward . You know your child best , so cater to their comfort level . Some may fare better to read about hygiene and puberty on their own and then come to you with questions . In this case , try " My Body , My Self for Boys " or " The What 's Happening to My Body ? Book for Girls " by authors Lynda and Area Madaras , a mother-daughter duo known for their experience teaching teen health education . <p> Most tweens wont appreciate being called out in front of their peers or family members . ( Go figure , nobody likes being told " hey , you smell ! " in front of others . ) Instead , opt to have several casual conversations at home or in the car on the way to or from school , ball practice or dance class . Because theyll likely procrastinate or have questions , plan to bring it up more than once . <p> Give Them a Say <p> Cost , availability and personal preference all play a part in determining what products your tween will use and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child the chance to make some of the decisions . For example , if he wants to shower in the morning instead of before bed , let him . If she wants to pick out the type of deodorant she uses , let her . Doing so will give your child ownership over their own hygiene . <p> Make It Their Responsibility <p> It may seem like no matter how hard you try , there will still be nagging on your part and complaining and trying to avoid awkward conversations on their part . To combat this , change the expectation . <p> Treat their hygiene just like you do their other household duties , such as cleaning their room and taking out the trash . If they fail to complete the task or do it poorly , let there be reasonable repercussions . As your child gets older and starts to pay more attention to their peers and their crushes , personal hygiene will seem much less like a dreaded chore . <p> Refute Teen Hygiene Myths <p> In junior high , a girl told me not to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . Is it weird that I believed her ? A straight-A student and I still did n't  think to double-check her facts . Even logical tweens and teens can be easily fooled by urban legends , especially when it comes to their changing bodies . <p> Be prepared to answer any questions your child may have and dispel any myths they may believe . For example , you may start by having them take this true or false quiz . <p> True or False ? <p> Hair that is shaved off grows back faster , thicker and darker . <p> False . Shaving cuts hair to a blunt tip but does n't  affect the hair follicle . This means shaving has no effect on the hairs thickness , color or rate of growth , according to Dr. Lawrence E.

Here 's how to overcome the toxic legacy of childhood bullying.BY MARIA NHAMBU <p> DepositPhotos You can take very deliberate steps to overcome a bullied past . <p> " If you were bullied as a child , chances are you still bear those scars as an adult . " <p> Bullying does n't  hurt you just when you 're a kid . In fact , the impact of childhood bullying can haunt you long past school years and well into adulthood . Recent research shows that bullying can cause social anxiety , shame , anger , and low self-esteem in adults , and as a result , individuals who were once bullied may continue making " safe " or " defensive " choices instead of choosing bolder , more beneficial options . <p> If you were bullied as a child , chances are you still bear those scars as an adult . I recall feeling unwanted , unloved , and even inhuman due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orphanage in Tanzania . Those feelings sink in , but you absolutely can not let them control your adult life ! The good news is you can reinvent yourself and overcome even extreme bullying when you let go of past abuse . <p> My new book , Africas Child describes how I was routinely and savagely beaten by my peers as a young child . For years , the older girls forced me to be their servant , and I was kicked and smacked when I did n't  oblige their orders . These same " big girls " forced the younger orphans and me to fight each other for their entertainment ; and at night I was regularly dragged out of bed for more beatings . Eventually , I spoke up to the nuns about the abuse , but was brutally retaliated against by the same vicious girls . <p> Through determination and hard work , today I am thriving , successful , and strong in spite of my difficult upbringing . I insist that you can not let a victimhood mentality control your life . Instead , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster your confidence and happiness .

As you recover from any past trauma , its helpful to know that you 're not alone . Whenever I speak about being bullied , I 'm always amazed to learn that many others have been affected by bullying as well . Sharing my story has helped me more than anything . Be sure to talk through the painful parts of your past with someone you trust . <p> " These same " big girls " forced the younger orphans and me to fight each other for their entertainment ; and at night I was regularly dragged out of bed for more beatings .

When you survive something awful , you could justify being a miserable person , but it is courageous to release old pain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullied , work hard to consciously let go of anger and depression that still lingers , and you will be a happier person . Having said that , remember that you can not fully " forget " the pain of bullying because it is part of your lifes experience . <p> 3 . Live wholeheartedly in the present . Keep reminding yourself that you were bullied in the past , and that today you are safe and in control of your life . As an adult , every time you talk about the bullying , you will relive it , because it is the nature of the beast . But do n't  let it define you . <p> 4 . Love and believe in yourself unconditionally . As a child , " Fat Mary " ( the nickname given to me by the nuns ) created another " Fat Mary " part friend , part consoler , part counselorto hold my sorrows , traumas , and joys until I was able to understand them . Fat Mary was a steadfast source of love that carried me through the highs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from old traumas can control your life if you let them .

At the end of the day , you create the life you are living , because no one else is responsible for how you feel . Choose to love yourself as much as you possibly can today , and you will discover the surprising depths of your strength . <p> 5 . Force yourself to make " uncomfortable " choices . People who were bullied as children may be afraid to make beneficial , bold decisions as adults ; instead they make small , safe choices , which squelches their potential . To combat this tendency , force yourself to step outside your comfort zone and make choices that scare you . Ask for that raise , join the soccer league , start your dream business . These moves will further help you develop confidence and trust yourself . <p> 6 . Find confidence through movement , like dance . Throughout childhood , I relied on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to observe the tribal dances of Africans living nearby . <p> Dancing released my pain , brought me joy , and restored my energy and enthusiasm for life .

I suggest daily walking , dancing , or another form of exercise as a confidence builder for anyone affected by childhood bullies . <p> 7 . Treat others with compassion . Being bullied in the past has likely expanded your capacity for empathy and compassion , as you have personally been on the receiving end of unnecessary cruelty . For this reason , be kind and gentle with everyone you meet , and spread love instead of blame . <p> 8 . Talk to the kids in your life about bullying . Even though you cant undo your own past , be sure to have frequent meaningful conversations to teach your children empathy ( the antithesis of bullying ) . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullying , and explain that even kids can take accountability for their actions and should choose to be kind and caring . <p> " It was as if I were looking out at my persecutors with eyes of stone .

Getting bullied eventually made me a strikingly resilient person . In fact , these early challenges are what gave me the courage and determination to live boldly . <p> Bullying by peers is tough , but eventually I found a space of no fear within myself . It was as if I were looking out at my persecutors with eyes of stone . No matter how badly I was beaten , no one could ever again reach my center and hurt my core .

However , in my clinical work as a psychologist and couples therapist , I hear examples every day of people who feel unappreciated and taken for granted by their spouse . Also , many people focus on what they do not have in their relationships versus what they do have . Why is it so hard for us to practice an attitude of gratitude and positivityespecially in our marriages ? One reason may be that scientists have found that the brain has a negativity bias . We tend to have Velcro for negative experiences , but Teflon for positive ones , so we often dismiss the positive aspects of our marriages while vividly remembering the negative ones . <p> Last week , I attended a seminar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanson at the Greater Good Science Center in Berkeley . I really appreciated Rick Hansons perspective that we all have the innate capacity to feel good , even though the scientists report this negativity bias of our brains . Dr. Hanson , my friend and author of " Buddhas Brain : The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness , Love , and Wisdom " suggests we actively overcome this negativity bias and , " Take in the good " several times per day because " Neurons that fire together , wire together . " The more we take in the good , the more our brain will change for the better . <p> Interesting perspective , but how do we actually do that ? <p> According to Dr. Hanson , the concept of " taking in the good " can be quite simple . Let positive facts become positive experiences . Let yourself feel good if you get something done , if someone is nice to you or if you notice a good quality in yourself . Savor the positive experiences . Really let them in . This practice can apply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or says something nice to you and notice when you say or do something nice for them .

Write down three to five things that you are grateful for . He reports that it does not matter if you write in your gratitude journal every morning or one time per week . You can write your blessings in a pretty journal or on a scrap of paperhow you do it does not matter . Just do it . Notice what you feel positive and thankful for . Dr. Emmons says that gratitude allows the celebration of the present , blocks toxic emotions , increases resiliency against stress and improves social ties and self-worth .

For every negative interaction , disagreement or hurt feeling , they have five positive , loving , caring or playful interactions to counterbalance it . <p> What is your magic ratio these days ? Do you have significantly more positive interactions with your spouse than negative ? Maybe it is time to increase the positivity by focusing more on what you do have in your relationship and what you love and appreciate about your partner . <p> I am reminded of an experience that I had many years ago .

Ever since then moths now mistakenly think they can capture the moon . Confronted with a flame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunar landing . It excitedly and persistently moves closer and closer to the candle , circling in ever smaller loops while its fragile wings clip the flame and the moth dies a fiery death . <p> Sobering , is n't it ? But if you have had an affair , you know that the kind of attraction you had felt is no less intense , and misdirected , as a moth circling a candle . You may tell yourself that you ought to stop your misguided flight path , set your sights on something safer and saner , but every time you move away from the flame you are compelled to return . <p> In contrast to flame addiction , people with a sex addiction are always looking for sexual gratification , so marital infidelities are par for the course . But people who have had affairs are as surprised by the development of a sexual relationship as their affair-mate is . These individuals do not typically seek out extra-marital sex . Nonetheless , they are attracted to another person , and that attraction becomes irresistible . <p> People who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as strong as the obsession for orgasm for a sex addict , or for that matter , as strong as the drive for cocaine for a crack addict . How can we explain the emotional experience that leads a faithful companion to become obsessed , preoccupied , reckless , conniving and depressed ? <p> We should start by looking at chemicals in the brain . Dopamine , for instance , is the brain 's reward chemical . When you associate a pleasurable sensation ( the sound of waves crashing on the beach ) , with some outside experience ( vacationing at the shore ) , your dopamine system is forever primed to feel good when you are triggered by the exposure to the stimulusso whenever you hear waves in the future , you get a rush of positive feelings . <p> Most of the time , the surge of dopamine in the brain is a good thing , especially when its associated with positive desires . For instance , when married couples who are deeply in love see each other , their dopamine levels rise . Dopamine gives the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy you did ! " This idea is n't rational ; its not well thought out . Its an irresistible gut feeling . <p> The dopamine centers cant tell when the desires are less healthy . For instance , heroin addicts also have a surge in their dopamine when they see a bag of drugs . Although on a conscious level , they know that using heroin can lead to deadly consequences , they nonetheless begin to feel a powerful urge to shoot up ( even if they are in sobriety ) . <p> Almost all addictions can be understood as irresistible cravings , and most experts agree that those cravings are mediated by dopamine . Flame addiction is no different . The person who wishes to end an affair might consciously tell him or herself that things are over , really over , once and for all . But any reminder of the other personthe voice , an e-mail , a picture , or even a memorycan generate a dopamine surge and start the avalanche of automatic feelings and the intense desire to be with that person . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for addiction helps people understand how a perfectly sane person can act so insane sometimes . It explains how difficult it is to resist actions that will end in negative consequences . It does not excuse the behavior . The crack addict with the most intense dopamine rush still has the choice to not use . Having an addiction does n't mean that you have to succumb to your urgesyou can stop . Lots of addicts have . Lots of flame addicts have also . <p> I find it helps the person who has been cheated on to understand how flame addiction works . Addictive behaviors are not turned off because someone simply wills them to stopit often takes time . Like the alcoholic who swears off drinking , but can fall of the wagon , a partner who promises to stop seeing the other person can slip and go back on his or her word . That is often part of the process of beating flame addiction .

We feel that if there has to be an argument , then it better be about something important . Here are our six easy tips to avoiding arguments in your marriage . <p> 1 . Pick Your Fights If you find yourself going down the slippery slope into an argument stop and ask yourself , " Is it really worth it ? " Does it really matter if you buy the brown eggs or the white eggs ? Will it change anything if the grass is mowed today or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument is n't about a truly important decision then why is it worth the effort and animosity ?

The best way to do this is by saying it in your head first and asking yourself , " Would I get upset if this was said to me ?

Fighting over text messages is the worst way possible to have an argument . It is too easy to misconstrue words when its being read off of a smartphone . You are also more likely to say things in a text , you would n't say in person and the tone of the conversation is easily lost . When you find yourselves getting into a digital argument put an immediate stop to the texts and call each other , or agree to continue the conversation later in person . No-one wins in a digital argument . <p> 4 . Silence Is Golden Is your spouse coming home and complaining about an annoying situation at work ? They seem so frustrated and depressed .

Sometimes the easiest way to fix a problem for your partner is by doing nothing else but being there for them . <p> 5 . Tackle the Problem Together , Not Each Other When we were planning our wedding there were plenty of decisions we could have argued about . Instead of having a battle of wills we decided to approach the decisions methodically . By working together to solve the problem we did n't  waste energy trying to prove each other wrong . <p> Focus your efforts on tackling the problem at hand , not on who 's right or wrong . Often times neither of you are 100% right or wrong ; put your energy into finding a compromise instead . <p> 6 . When Its Over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your feet . Maybe even cried . You finally decided to get the 1% milk instead of the skimmed . It is time to let it go and put it behind you . Do n't  bring up the argument again in 5 minutes , or hours , or days later .

JOHN DEMARTINI <p> DepositPhotos When your spouse can see and appreciate the value they are less likely to stray . <p> " Couples with a balance of overall powers keep each other in homeostatic check . " <p> I was asked recently whether there was an explanation why husbands or wives stray . My answer was simple : Relationships may start out romantic , but they also remain utilitarian . Individuals are not loyal to other individuals , they are loyal only to the fulfillment of their own highest values ( what is most important to them ) . <p> Everyone has a hierarchy of valuesprioritieswhich determines how they perceive , make decisions and act upon the world . These values influence what they like or dislike , are attracted to or repelled by , and what opens them up or shuts them down.These values might be concentrated in a particular part of a persons life or spread from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , physical and spiritual . <p> At the beginning of a relationship , a couple would normally balance each others unique values out . So if a woman values security , she will value a mate that brings business , leadership and financial empowerment into her life . If a man values beauty and influence then he would value a mate that brings physical and social power to the relationship . <p> But as the relationship matures , if one spouse begins sacrificing their highest values for their more empowered partners , there will be an imbalance . Where this becomes extreme , the relationship becomes stressed and vulnerable . Whoever has the most power ( over-dog ) often wants more freedom and may seek out alternative options . Whoever has the least power ( under-dog ) often wants more constraint and fidelity . Marriage and monogamy to them is generally a higher priority . <p> Someone who is empowered in most or all areas of their life is successful in their career , will have wealth , will be physically attractive ; educated and articulate and generally considered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse who has become disempowered , who abandoned their own career and financial independence , gave up on their dreams to opt for a dependency role when married ; is going to experience an extremely polarized imbalance of empowerment in the marriage . The " over-dog " will start searching for a new partner or partners to balance out his or her own power levels . That 's when it is wise for the " under-dog " to stop injecting their partners values into their life and look into the mirror . <p> They need to reclaim a feeling of self-worth and re-magnetize their mate . When they value themselves ; so do others . When they offer what is perceived as value , their mates stick around . <p> " As long as they are getting their values met they are less likely to stray . " <p> When a couple is more equally empowered , maintains and communicates fair exchange and has their values met equally at home , they will be less likely to seek others out of the home . Couples with a balance of overall powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more stable relationship . They experience only mild oscillations in their relationship dynamic which are not enough to motivate what society calls infidelity . As long as they are getting their values met they are less likely to stray . <p> So when people stray , its not because they are villains . It is because they are individuals with unfulfilled values seeking alternative options to fulfill them . The spouses or partners of these individuals are also not victims of some evil crime . They are simply receiving a wake-up call on how relationships work and how to empower themselves so they can offer greater value . <p> Dr John Demartini is a leading authority in human behavior and leadership development .

BARRY <p> BigStockPhoto Your marriage can be as strong as you want it to , as long as you put in a little effort . <p> Whether you have been married for six months or 60 years , you can always learn ways to become a better husband or wife . In fact , the happiest couples I know are the ones who make a deliberate effort to learn how to make their marriage better . Many people are required to take continued education courses to become better employees . Imagine how much lower the divorce rate would be if we were required to take continued education courses to become better spouses ! <p> Most of us did n't  have very good training on how to be a great marriage partner . We learned by observing our parents and watching couples on TV sitcoms . Few of us had adequate pre-marital counseling , if any at all . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with guilt , give each other the silent treatment , take each other for granted , and gossip about each other to friends , parents and even our kids . Instead of understanding and appreciating the differences between men and women , wives learned to be offended whenever their husband behaved like a man , and husbands learned to be irritated whenever their wife behaved like a woman . <p> Here are some ways you can become a better spouse in 2009 : <p> 1 . Seek out others who have a great marriage and learn from them . Ask what they do to keep their marriage strong . Spend time with them so you can observe the way they speak to one another . Watch what they do to show each other love . Notice the way they look at each other . ( Limit your time with women who complain about their husbands , and men who ca n't stand their wives ) . <p> 2 . Find out what makes your spouse feel loved . Does your wife love it when you surprise her with flowers ? Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long day ? How does your wife react when you help out with chores without being asked ? Does your husband smile when you say , " Thanks for going to work today ? " Does your wife well up with pride when you say , " Dinner tastes great , thanks for cooking " ? Does your wife feel like a queen when you drop her off in front of the mall so she does n't  have to walk in the cold ? Does your husband blush when you compliment him in front of your friends , family and kids ? If you are n't  sure what makes your spouse feel loved , ask ! Instead of keeping score of who worked harder each day , treat each other the way you did when you first fell in love . <p> 3 . Go on dates ! Do the activities you did that made you fall in love in the first place . The most loving couples I know go on weekly dates , even ifespecially ifthey have kids . Even if its just going out for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip out of their role as Mom and Dad , and just enjoy each being with each other as husband and wife . <p> 4 . Read a book , see a counselor , or attend a seminar designed to improve your marriage . Insightful books like , The Secrets of Happily Married Women by Dr. Scott Haltzman can transform your marriage ! If you struggle with one issue in particular , such as difficult in-laws , read a book so you can learn how to unite as a couple . If you and your wife argue about sex , go to a couples ' marriage conference and attend a workshop about how to have a more fulfilling sex life . If you and your wife often disagree about parenting decisions , visit a marriage-friendly therapist who can offer wise advice . <p> 5 . Make your spouse your first priority over your parents , boss and even your kids . Every day , you are presented with several choices that either will or will not reflect your priorities . One of my favorite quotes ( by Stephen Covey ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important is an unconscious commitment to the unimportant . " Your marriage is important , so make sure to protect it by making wise decisions . If your mom invites you to visit for the weekend , but your wife already has other plans , have the courage to ask your mom for a rain check instead of ignoring your wifes needsif your spouse does n't  get along with your parents , it probably has a lot to do with your behavior ! If you 're tempted to postpone a date with your husband because you feel guilty for not spending enough time with the kids , go on the date anyway . There 's nothing better you can do for your kids than have a loving relationship with their father ! Do n't  focus so hard on being a great parent that you forget to be a great spouse . <p> Its unfortunate that in many marriages the partners bring out the worst in each other .

@@79604672 @1104672/ <p> BigStockPhoto Reconnecting after a surgery takes time and communication . <p> In our third and final installment we are going to discuss the simple changes to your sexual routine that can help after prostate surgery . These techniques can be used with or without the use of medications for erectile dysfunction . <p> One of the most important things to remember is that after prostate surgery , your husbands subsequent sexual difficulties can originate from physical or psychological issues , or a combination of the two . Many males feel less of a man after surgery and there is a period where he may wonder if his pride and joy ( his penis ) is ever going to perform again . Slowing things down and focusing on new methods of arousal will address all of his concerns . Make sure that he is medically cleared for sexual activity . <p> First Things First After surgery , most men will take longer to become aroused . This is a great opportunity to try something you may not have done in a while . You may have to romance him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingerie ? How about giving him a strip tease or a lap dance ? How about putting on an adult film ? <p> Now that you are communicating better , use your new verbal skills in the bedroom . Walk him through what you want to do sexuallymost men are very literal in their use of language and sexy talk is a big turn on . Remind him of how much you love having a sexual connection and that you want him just as much as before . Reassurance during times of stress goes a long way ! <p> The next step is simple if you have been following our advice . We are always adamant about making sure the female is pleasured first , having at least one orgasm before progressing to intercourse . This is important for her because after climaxing , she will be more lubricated and her body will be more accommodating for penetration . She will also enjoy intercourse infinitely more if she is well lubricated . After prostate surgery , its important for a husband to focus on his wifes pleasure because watching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulating ! He can feed off of her arousal and focus on the growing passion . <p> What Next ? Once she is satisfied , he should be getting excited . It is very important to remember that most men post surgery may need a lot more direct genital stimulation to build and maintain an erection . Using plenty of water-based lubricant or a sexual enhancement cream , she should begin massaging his penis in long strokes . Communication here is key . Ask him if it feels good , does he like the pressure and the tempo ? As he becomes aroused , start talking sexy , asking if he likes that . Some men may also enjoy the combination of oral and hand play to stimulate the head of the penis , where most of the nerve endings are located . Use your mouth to stimulate the head of the penis while you use one or both hands to stroke the shaft . The urethra is very sensitive , so stroke over the tip of the penis with your mouth or fingers ! Many men like to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him stay aroused as he gets hard . <p> The choice of what to do now is yours . Some men may want to climax this way , from oral and manual stimulation . Others may want to attempt to move on to intercourse . Regardless of which direction you chooseand if he is having trouble maintaining his erectiontry sliding a cock ring over the penis and rolling it to the very base . This soft ring ( usually made of silicone , hard plastic or leather ) will help trap the blood flow in the penis , keeping him harder longer . Some have bullet vibrators in them for him and her to add extra sensations that many find different and fun . If you do n't  have a cock ring , either you or your husband can grab the base of the penis with your fingers and pinch-off the blood flow . <p> Ready For Intercourse While we usually are not big fans of the missionary position , it has a few advantages for men post prostate surgery . The biggest one is that gravity is on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it there . We would recommend putting a couple of pillows under her hips , so she is a little closer to him and tipped upward , so his strokes have a shot of hitting her G-spot during intercourse . During intercourse , keep your strokes short and at an active tempo . Deeper thrusts are used to calm down the urge to climax and that 's not what you want here . Constant stimulation to the shaft of the penis keeps the blood in the penis since the muscles of the shaft are engaged . <p> If you are in the middle of intercourse and you begin to lose your erection , do n't  worry ; simply use your fingers to grasp the base of the penis ( either one of you can do it ) , preventing blood from escaping . Stay inside your spouse with the head of the penis in the outer third of the vagina so that she can squeeze with her vaginal muscles to help keep him erect and make love : kiss and stroke each other all over and enjoy the journey instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding off of each others passion should help your erection to rebound and lead you to orgasm . The second great position for keeping the blood in the penis and for keeping access to her clitoris is " doggy style . " Try it and see if it works as well for you as the missionary position . <p> For those of you that are having serious trouble getting hard enough for penetration , use a cock ring or form a ring with your fingers ( as described above ) to get just hard enough to enter her vagina in the missionary position . This is called " the soft entry technique " and you maintain the erection with your fingers around the base of the penis . Continue thrusting as we described , focusing on the pleasurable sensations and the pleasure you are giving your spouse . Erections will follow your mental focus , so stay locked on the pleasure and let your passion flow through you . <p> The Future and Beyond Bear in mind that after prostate surgery , a mans orgasm will be different . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may feel different . Do n't  concern yourself with comparing your historic orgasms to the ones you will have today and tomorrow . Embrace the way things are and enjoy the ride ! You will find that while things may be different , sexual pleasure can be yours again with a little more attention to detail and a lot of communication . Implementing erectile dysfunction drugs may be helpful , since they help increase blood flow to the penis . <p> We hope these tips help all of you and your spouse in dealing with post-prostate surgery issues . If you continue having difficulties reconnecting sexually , consider meeting with a marriage counselor who specializes in sexual issues or a sex therapist . Remember , great sex in marriage is about celebrating a great love affair . As we age and our bodies change , sex changes and we may need to adapt .

However , its really interesting that even though we have broken from traditionalism , women still tend to be the ones responsible for the houseeven if they are also holding down a job outside of the house . <p> Of course , this is n't fair . And , as a further enticement , recent research has indicated that when men do help with housework , their wives are more willing to have sex . So , it certainly is a win-win situation . <p> Its also possible , from what you state , that your husband is willing to help but that 's where the differences begin . This can be due to a number of reasons . It may be nothing more than a stylistic difference in the way each of you perceives a " straightened up " house . Most couples have many of these differences and they mean nothing more than a variation in the way you look at the world . <p> Regardless of whether your husband has lower standards of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't  get it , what it requires is you telling him directly what youd like done . I can not tell you how many males Ive seen in my practice who will voice something like , " I 'd be only too happy to do what she wants if shed only tell me what it is she wants . " <p> Its important for you to remember that the brains of men and women are wired differently . He wont necessarily see what you see and the fact that he does n't  is by no means an indication that he does n't  care . <p> If you do find some things that still are n't  to your liking , remember to first appreciate what he has done . No one likes to be criticized . There 's actual research that shows a 5:1 ratio between positive and negative comments . What this means is that if you say five nice things to someone and then one negative thing , the negative has such a strong impact , you might as well not even said anything positive ! <p> By being critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help at all . But if you 're appreciative first and then nicely point out some other things youd like done , you 'll have a lot more success . Criticism only makes someone feel attacked which leads to shutting down . <p> Your desire to be heard and helped is quite understandable . But his need to be spoken to in a way that is not demeaning is also essential . Respect in a relationship is the number one factor for a partnership going well especially when it goes both ways ! 113807 @qwx733807

CARLA MARIE MANLY <p> DepositPhoto Turn the arguments around and create spectacular intimacy within your marriage . <p> " The key to healthy sexual intimacy is found through steadfast commitment and clear , solid communication . " <p> When you first met your sweetheart , chances are that sexual attraction was part of the draw . Sexuality is a wonderful part of our humanness , yet its importance in the success of a relationship is often overlooked or simply avoided . In the months and years leading up to marriage , a couples sex life can be hot and steamy , adding a heady level of passion to the relationship . After the honeymoon , couples often find that their sex life diminishes as the rigors of daily schedules take their toll . Once children are added to the mix , a couples sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strains of the childrearing years . At least one spouse is often left feeling hurt or angry when the essential element of sexual intimacy is removed from the equation . In fact , when couples seek marriage therapy , sexual problems are often an underlying issue . <p> When addressing sexual issues with couples , I have often likened a couples sex life to an automobile engine . In the early stages of a relationship , sexuality is often the engine that keeps a relationship exciting and purring along . As the relationship progresses , it becomes more like the oil that keeps the engine running smoothly . When a busy couples sex life is drained and little lubricant is added , the engine simply does n't  function well . <p> Over time , long term damage can result by oversight and neglect . As negative as that situation may sound , imagine what happens when a couples sexual relationship goes awry as a result of unhealthy behaviors that sabotage the engine . Consciously and unconsciously , sexuality is all too often used as a tool to gain power or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done when oil is n't added to the engine as a means of punishing a partner . Its easy to picture the damage that occurs when the engine oil is withheld intentionally out of anger or hurt . As well , problematic malfunctions occur when negative tactics and power struggles contaminate this essential lubricant . It is also understandable that no relationship will be in top form when the oil of sexual intimacy is offered only as a reward or special favor . In the worst of cases , both partners can become entrenched in the power struggle , and a full scale war is silently waged . What was once a shiny , purring engine becomes nothing more than a pile of metal scraps used to wage a war . <p> Just as a consistent level of open and honest verbal communication is an essential element of a healthy marriage , communicating about sexual issues is also vital . Sexual intimacy is an important form of communication within a relationship . No marriage can function well when the beauty of sexuality is used in a harmful , controlling manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical release , but the intimacy component of sexuality provides a bonding element that is critical . Sexual intimacy offers couples a time to be emotionally close and open . A couples sexual relationship can provide a connective " safe haven " from the outside world . When functioning well , a couples sexual relationship creates and reinforces feelings of deep love , commitment , and trust . <p> Indeed , these elements are the most rewarding aspects of sexual intimacy . Long after individual orgasms are forgotten , the deeply bonding energy of true intimacy remains . On a neurobiological level , sexual intimacy causes a surge in oxytocin , often termed the " cuddle hormone . " A key hormone in sexual intimacy , research evidence shows that oxytocin creates strong pair bonding . Interestingly , oxytocin also counteracts anxiety and fear , both of which are associated with stress and high levels of cortisol , a hormone often referred to as " public health enemy number one . " <p> Many articles focus on womens need for emotional closeness and safety in sexual relationships , yet men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security . Although a males sexual drive and tendency to compartmentalize emotions may allow him to engage in sexual activity without feeling close or safe , some women also operate in the same fashion . It is important to note that the misuse of sex within relationships does not confine itself to males or females . Both men and women can learn to use sex to create greater intimacy and , conversely , both sexes can learn to use sex as a weapon within a marriage . <p> When Sex Is a Weapon <p> When sex is used to make war rather than to make love , the effects can be devastating . On a neurobiological level alone , the body is deprived of the truly positive effects of several neurochemicals , including the bond-building oxytocin . Instead , negative sexual war tactics build levels of stress-related neurochemicals , such as adrenaline and cortisol . <p> On a more visible level , partners that utilize sexuality for power and control find that the marriage suffers in many areas . In general , open communication is often diminished , conflicts tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unhealthy passive-aggressive or openly aggressive behavior patterns often become the norm . <p> " When sex becomes a weapon of physical or emotional aggression , lasting harm can be done to the vital sense of trust and safety in a marriage . " <p> Passive-aggressive behaviors are common and include tactics such as intentionally withholding sex or only offering sex as a reward when the partner has " done something right . " Worse yet , when sex becomes a weapon of physical or emotional aggression , lasting harm can be done to the vital sense of trust and safety in a marriage . If the level of aggression rises , physical abuse can result , leaving the relationship completely unsafe. * When a couples sexual relationship goes awry , the level of tension in the household can be palpable . Not only is the couple often miserable , but children , friends , and other family members may also suffer as a result of the unresolved problems . <p> At this point you might be asking , " What 's the fix for this private , painful problem ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most " sex wars " come about as a result of longstanding communication issues that surface through sexual relations or the lack of sexual relations . In either case , the dysfunctional patterns that surface through " sex wars " take a toll on the overall health of the marriage . The key to healthy sexual intimacy is found through steadfast commitment and clear , solid communication . As easy as the following 10 tips may sound , the repair process takes time , focus , and dedication . <p> 10 Tips to Make Love , Not War <p> 1 . Style Matters ! Become familiar with your communication style and that of your spouse . If you and your partner are having difficulties with sexual intimacy , chances are that you might need to make adjustments . Whether addressing general matters or those related to sexual issues , the most healthy communication style is known as " assertive . " <p> Unlike the other styles , the " assertive " communicator is able to speak openly and clearly about his or her needs , thoughts , and feelings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing that often occurs in the other communication styles . " Passive , " " aggressive , " and " passive-aggressive " communicators tend to experience more difficulties in their personal relationships . A troubled sex life is often symptomatic of unresolved issues that can be healed with open communication . Sexual intimacy can be restored when sex is not used as a weapon or tool to gain power and control . With awareness and focus , you can shift away from unhealthy communication patterns that harm you and your relationships . If you do n't  know your communication style , refer to " The Basics of Fighting Fair . " <p> 2 . Commit to Open , Fair Communication ! Once you 've firmed up your understanding of your communication style , make a commitment to yourself and your spouse to strive for healthy communication patterns . Ideally , your partner will share in your commitment , and the two of you can work in tandem to build open , loving patterns of communication . In building ( or rebuilding ) sexual intimacy , it is critical that communication be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of " I messages " that focus on your feelings ( " I feel sad that you spent your rare free time with your friends instead of with me ! " ) . Avoid attacking your spouse ; instead , strive to understand , address , and resolve the actual problem . <p> 3 . Take Your Finger Off the Button ! It can be tempting to get into the old habit of " pushing your partners buttons , " but such patterns erode a sense of safety in a relationship . Rather than using your intimate knowledge of your sweethearts " buttons " to cause harm , strive to be extra careful of your loved ones sensitive areas . Remember , a sense of emotional safety and connectedness is the foundation of healthy sexual intimacy . <p> 4 . Collaborate ! Whether you tend to avoid " hot topics " or fight constantly with your mate , many marriages falter when couples can not agree to disagree . By focusing on your partnership and the overall health of the relationship , you can work with your husband or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focusing on who " wins " and who " loses , " true collaboration has one goal : the long-term success of the relationship .

As underlying issues are resolved openly and honestly , the war games that have plagued your sex life will steadily disappear . <p> " Remember , a sense of emotional safety and connectedness is the foundation of healthy sexual intimacy . " <p> 5 . Build on the Basics ! Get back to the basics of building a friendship with your spouse . Make time to talk privately and enjoy quiet time together . When possible , make time to talk daily about your relationship ; during this special time , avoid talking about stressful topics including work , finances , or other difficult topics . Whether you take a walk around the block or have a cup of tea before bed , commit to sharing gentle moments together . When a couple suffers from a lack of healthy sexual intimacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusting , caring friendship . <p> 6 . Prioritize Your Spouse ! Let your partner know how much you care by showing through actions , not just words , that they are a deeply meaningful part of your life . Sexual intimacy is based in on having a sense of safety and emotional connection . Whether you make a bubble bath for your sweetie or wake early to brew a special cup of coffee , simple shifts in behaviors can show your spouse that you really care . <p> 7 . Clean Slate , Fresh Bedroom ! Make a pact with your sweetie that you will start with a clean slate . Agree to avoid rehashing the old , unhealthy behaviors of the past . Instead , commit to focusing on the positive , fresh behaviors that will fill your marriage with love and respect . By creating new , healthy patterns , you will naturally keep destructive arguments out of the bedroom . With the idea of a starting fresh , you might even invest in a few new bedroom items , such as candles and pillows to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 . Date Again ! Make a point of remembering what attracted you to your spouse when you first met . Make a list of everything that drew you to your sweetheart and every positive quality you can possibly find . Instead of paying attention to your partners faults or weaknesses , strive to focus on what you love about your mate . By shifting your attention to what you love and adore about your spouse , you will automatically become more connected . With a healthy shift in attitude , you can rekindle that special , bonding love . Make time to take your sweetheart out on dates . Go to the movies . Take a moonlit walk in the park . Kiss on the couch . Let your imagination go wild . <p> 9 . Cuddle ! As your marriage heals and you 're feeling closer to your spouse , it might be tempting to rush straight into hot , passionate sex . Try to avoid the urge , for the end result is worth the wait . Sensate Focus , introduced by the famous human sexuality researchers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimacy . Initially , the focus is on gentle touch that avoids the breasts and genitals . Intercourse is prohibited , as the goal is to attend to the sensations that arise from touching your partners skin .

Even in later stages that include intercourse , the focus is not on orgasm , but a fuller awareness of sensuality and sexual intimacy itself . It takes time to build new patterns . By not jumping back into sex right away , you 'll allow healthy patterns time to form and grow . <p> 10 . Look for the Magic ! Oh , Baby ! With concentrated attention , your intimate relationship will slowly transform . It wo n't happen overnight , but you will see incredible changes if you and your sweetie make dedicated efforts to build a healthy sexual relationship . Over time , you will notice a sense of sweetness in your love life and your overall relationship . As you create a safe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow stronger and healthier .

MICHELLE GANNON <p> BigStockPhoto Making time for one another is one of the six research-proven habits for a happy marriage . <p> " Happily married couples respond to one anothers bids for attention 86 percent of the time . " <p> Recently , I attended a seminar called , " The Science of a Great Relationship " at the Greater Good Science Center . Two experts at the seminar , sociologist and happiness expert , Dr. Christine Carter , and Stanford forgiveness expert , Dr. Fred Luskin , spoke on the latest research regarding marriage and marital happiness . Here are some of my favorite reminders and research-proven habits I took away from the seminar , as well as a few of my own . <p> 1 .

They ask one another questions , communicate understanding and respond positively when their spouse asks them to . They say " Yes " to one another as often as possible .

Make sure you know that you really matter to one another , and that you are there for one another . <p> 5 . Cultivate Forgiveness According to Dr. Fred Luskin of the Stanford Forgiveness Project , there are some important steps to forgiveness . <p> You need to first remind yourself that we are all flawed human beings . Successful forgiveness requires that we allow ourselves to feel deeply our hurt , disappointment and anger . We need to ask ourselves whether the betrayal or disappointment is a deal breaker or not ?

All of this can happen even if our partner is not willing to take responsibility and change . According to the research , forgiveness is essential in successful , happy marriages .

In my own marriage , my husband and I find that when we are interested and supportive of one anothers personal growth , we are much happier as both individuals and as a couple .

" <p> All relationships encounter points where one or both partners become irritated with the other . Ideally , many of these irritations are accepted as just part of the marriage deal . Just because your husband or wife does something that bothers you does not mean you need to bring it to his or her attention . <p> Tolerating differences in behavior or in a spouse 's personality quirks are aspects of marriage that require patience and tolerance . Just as your partner does things that annoy you , you can be sure that you are equally guilty of doing things that annoy him or her . Some hurts are difficult to accept or tolerate and need to be talked about . For many people , talking about hurts and upsets is easier said than done . This may be due to partners being ineffective communicators or because one partner , or both partners is conflict-avoidant . <p> Perhaps you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are resistant to share your feelings because of a fear of causing a fight .

Even though you may feel frustrated that your efforts at communication have failed , be mindful that the hurt feelings do not dissipate without the opportunity for emotionally safe conversation . Most importantly , the failure to address feelings of hurt , anger , or relationship neglect increases the potential for resentment to emerge in the relationship . Resentment develops when you repeatedly feel unheard , dismissed or feel that a spouse puts other interests ahead of you and the marriage . <p> Resentment grows gradually over time due to repeated instances of feeling dismissed , undervalued , and invalidated .

" <p> It may feel easier to try and ignore the feelings or to give up communicating openly altogether . This survival strategy will backfire as it only serves to create more distance between partners and fails to give a possibly ignorant partner the opportunity to rectify the hurt feelings . To diminish resentment , the hurt spouse must choose communication over choosing to ignore , and the other partner must be open to his or her feedback . <p> Facing feelings of resentment directly requires emotional courage , vulnerability , and respectful speaking and listening skills .

" <p> This invitation to a discussion about feelings of resentment avoids one-sided blaming and uses " I " statements so that the hurt spouse takes ownership of his or her feelings . Additionally , it focuses on why it is important to discuss this issueto reestablish connection and to diminish resentment . The request to schedule a time for the conversation gives both partners an opportunity to prepare and approach the discussion with a clear head , and it avoids making the approached partner feel blindsided or bombarded . <p> When your spouse tries to talk to you about feelings of resentment , it is easy to become defensive or feel driven to go on the attack if you feel misunderstood or unfairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your instinctual self-protective response is to deny , diminish , or counterattack .

Listen with the knowledge that you too will have a chance to share your thoughts and feelings . Listen with the knowledge that your spouse is being vulnerable and sharing his or her feelings because he or she is feeling emotionally distant from you .

When your spouse loses a parent , you may be thrown into an uncharted ocean of emotion you may not be ready for . " When a parent dies , part of your past dies , " says Heidi Horsley , a therapist and grief expert .

He lived only two weeks after the surgery . <p> In those two weeks and in the days and months that followed , Angela and Joe drew closer . " We talked moreobviously about decisions about his dad 's care and what to do . We even entertained the thought of having him live with us , " says Angela . " And we hugged more .

" <p> After Angie died on March 15 , with both Joe and Angela at his side , they had to make the arrangements and preparations for burial . They were also faced with giving the eulogy . Joe approached friends and family about it , but they all declined and deferred back to him , so Angela offered to help . <p> She quickly went to work and typed up many thoughts that helped express how they both felt about Angie .

I hate the fact that the only time we have sex is when , where , and how she wants it . It sometimes seems like she is just fulfilling her wifely duties ... AUGH ! <p> I have tried books , romance , dating , toys , lubes , movies ( not hardcore , but those on how to find the G-spot or creative lovemaking ) , and fantasy magazines .

Second , it opens up the door for the person , whose needs are not being met , to consider leaving the relationship ; or worse , cheat on them and possibly bringing home a STD . This is what we hope for you to avoid ! <p> You obviously are trying different ways to spice it up sexually ! Great job ! So , what is holding her back ? <p> There are times in all relationships where the sex becomes a little dull , but if you are ready to leave then it is time for a serious chat with her . Maybe she just does n't  get the severity of your frustration and thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from a loving family or one that is very detached from their emotions and bodies ? It all makes a difference as to how much she is able to open her mind and try to want to become more sexually free for her and for you ! <p> Most of us learn how to be a spouse from watching our parents . Not the best way to learn , but it does give us patterns as to how to deal with sexual needs and our ability to allow ourselves to be sexually open-minded , or not . But it can change if the desire is there on both sides . <p> It sounds here as if the responsibility for initiating sexual encounters is falling predominately on you , the male spouse . We often hear the frustration of not having a female partner who tries to initiate or seduce their guyeven though he really likes this part of sex play . Many men want their wife to spice up their sexual relationships by role playing with costumes or pretending they are strangers or any other ways to show their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting your spouse to also be your best fantasy . Some women were taught that sex is to be tolerated , but not enjoyedso they merely " fulfill their wifely duties . " This is sad , but many women are not programmed to allow themselves to be a " bad girl , " or " slutty " in the bedroom . Many women may not even know if they are having an orgasm because they have not explored themselves ( masturbation ) in order to find out what really feels good to them . <p> This is the perfect time to consider having a heart-to-heart talk about how you envision your intimate life together . Your sexuality and your sexual needs are a normal part of being a romantic couple . Being a happily married couple involves talking about your sex life to make sure that both people are having a sexually satisfying life , just as you would talk about your other goals and dreams .

Although it is safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can spice it up and have a great time . <p> So how do you start the conversation ? You could begin by saying that you feel your sexual needs are not being met . You always want to have these conversations in a non-sexual encounter , without the kids around , and give her the clue that you want to talk about your levels of intimacy . If she is not ready to have this conversation at that moment , ask to make special time for this talk , as it is important to you . <p> Here are some questions that need to be discussed : <p> * Does she understand that you are sexually frustrated and that being sexually compatible is important to you ? <p> * Does she know that you considered leaving her for this reason ? <p> * Does she feel pressured to have sex ? Does she enjoy sex with you ? <p> * Does she orgasm every time you have a sexual encounter ?

Try morning sex ! <p> * Is she willing to try different kinds of sex play and experiment with you in a safe environment ? <p> In our research , we have found that the couples that have lasting , happy relationships are able to have these conversations without anger and resentment . There should be no negative judgment , and no blaming . This communication is just a reality check that something is n't working for one of you . When you can have these types of conversations , every conversation becomes easier . You clearly want her to be your " intimate , erotic , friend " and she needs to hear these words in order for her to want to try to go outside of her comfort zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more sexually confident . Nothing will change in your relationship unless you are both committed to enhancing your sexual connection . <p> Normally , we would suggest a night of mutual masturbation , literally showing your spouse what feels good in order to climax , but she has to feel comfortable enough with her body to do thisto have an orgasm in front of you . Also , taking more time during foreplay ( outercourse ) will help her to feel like her needs are being met . Does she like you to perform oral sex on her ? Take a night and make it all about her pleasure to show her how great sex can feel ! <p> We are saddened when " sex experts " say that men are all bad , since they probably never hear from men like you who want to have a great sexual connection with their wives ! The love that you share is obvious when you ask for help despite your frustration . We love hearing from men like you ! <p> We hope that you can talk to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts with a safe , loving chat and tender touching .

" <p> It does not take years of marriage to discover that boredom has set in . For many , that indescribable thrill initially felt can vanish within even the first year of tying he knot . Listening , as I do , to countless men and women who have become disenchanted with their spouses , I have found there are many reasons this happens . Lack of trust is a huge factor , yet an even more frequent complaint is that a person has grown tired of or grown away from his/her mate , and life with their mate has become dull or boring with no pizzazz or spark . <p> Some of my clients , as they tell me their stories through both tears and occasionally laughter , say that what it was that once caused a thrill and provided a hard-to-articulate excitement either became non-existent in the marriage or rather ho-hum .

The thrill can be sustained , and even improved upon , if only courting never ends . As you break it downget to the heart of flirtingyou soon recognize that the key component of courting is flirtation . <p> Before you consider reinstating flirtation into your marriage , you must first get your head in the right frame of mindwhere it once was during the courting stage of your relationship . I am convinced that if couples went the extra mile to treat their spouses with the same " **28;204;TOOLONG , " mentality , he or she would keep the ennui from creeping into the relationship . <p> Flirtation does not have to end .

Try one or all of the following ten tips : <p> 1 . Leave a small flirty note . Communicate a fun , romantic or sexy message to your spouse via text , e-mail , voice message or , if you 're " old school , " put a sticky note on the fridge , on his/her side of the bathroom vanity , or the dashboard of the car . The message can be simple and to the point like , " Hey , what are you doing later ? " <p> 2 . Give the special look . The next time you are in a crowded room sitting around the dinner table with friends and family , do n't  say a word . At the right moment , make eye contact with your spouse and give him/her that special look , that cheeky smile or a mischievous wink . He or she will get your drift . <p> 3 . Give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very gentle way at a time when they least expects it . It can be a soft touch or a flirtatious one . Putting your hand over theirs during a parent-teacher conference , gently stroking the back of your partners neck while watching a movie , or slipping off your shoe momentarily under a restaurant booth and running your toes against your spouses ankle is a great way to set off a spark . <p> 4 . Offer the unexpected comment . Say the most flirtatious and out-of-the-blue thing at the most unlikely time . Instead of " I 'm glad I married you " over dinner on your anniversary , try " Will you marry me , again ? " while your heading down the grocery or hardware store aisle . It is those unexpected comments at the most unusual times and places that can be so pleasantly provocative . <p> 5 . Let loose the devil in your voice . Summon up that special tone of voice you used when you were first dating your spouse . For instance , instead of saying , " Where do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter-of-fact tone , try to attach another attitude to that same question , the one you used to usethe one that had a little devilish subtext beneath it . <p> 6 . Resurrect the pet names . Do n't  forget that pet name you once called your spouse . In the early stages of your relationship you no doubt had a special way of addressing your spouse . It may have stuck with you for a time and then you may have forgotten to use it . Bring it back . <p> 7 . Deliver the unexpected gesture . Surprise your mate with your romantic actions which might include sending a greeting card for no apparent reason whatsoever , summoning your spouse into the master bath after the kids are fast asleep where you have a waiting candlelight bubble bath for the two of you ; or carving you and your spouses initials into your favorite backyard tree . To direct your spouses attention to that spot , you might suggest he or she carefully check the tree because you suspect that there might a hornets nest forming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flirty stranger . Next time you are alone or with a crowd of others in an elevator sneak a quick kiss or , better yet , come on to your spouse with a quick one-liner like you are just meeting them for the first time . You 'll please the onlookers if there are others riding up or down with you and even if its just the two of you , it is a great way to flirt . Such a " role-playing " moment might portend of what is to follow later . <p> 9 . Arrive home with intention . Next time you come home from work bolt through the door with force and head right for your spouse . Grab him or her and begin to shower your spouse with hugs and kisses like its been weeks since you saw him/her .

Let 's say you are at the cleaners together and you suddenly lean over and whisper , " You want to go to a party tonight ? " Yes , that is a great flirting line , but I challenge you to use your imagination to make your list . If you get stuck , watch some really well done romantic comedies and jot down a few classic lines like , " You had me at hello , " ( Jerry McGuire ) , " I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship , " ( Casablanca ) , or " Do you love me because Im beautiful or am I beautiful because you love me ?

ANDREA WEINER <p> BigStockPhoto Kids who love themselves will have the emotional intelligence to treat others better . <p> " Teaching children how to love themselves can be the antidote to helping children deal with all of the external forces that they get bombarded with on a daily basis . " <p> Does the title of this article bring up images of self-centered , egotistical , indulgent children ? After all , the Millennial Generation ( those children born after 1980 ) , have gotten the rap of being the group of children that are both savvy educationally and technologically efficient and the most indulged compared to previous generations of children before them . Yet , here 's the myth buster : teaching children to say " I love me " or to practice the tenets of self-love does not turn children into a generation of narcissists or demanding , selfish children . In fact , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love Me Generation " would be characterized by being caring and loving toward themselves as well as to others . They would be appreciative of their talents and be accepting of who they are . By being accepting of themselves , they would in turn be the same towards their friends , classmates , siblings , and parents . <p> Most importantly , because of loving themselves , they would be able to make loving decisions that lead to prudent actions . This means questioning and refraining from overindulging in drugs and alcohol , having sex before you are mature enough to handle it , partaking in bullying and humiliating behavior to others , and being in unhealthy relationships that cause pain and hurt . Being able to love yourself demonstrated by lots of " I love me " actions leads to true , authentic " I love you " to others . <p> Most parents tell their children that they love them and most believe that speaking those words over and over again will gain validity and that children will then internalize the daily " I love you 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message children actually hear is that someone else loves them and it bypasses the notion that they have to learn how to love themselves first in order to pass on that loving behavior on to others . <p> Also , parents may mistake self-love with self-esteem . They may look similar word-wise , but actually one has to come before the other . When you love yourself first it creates a natural byproduct of high self-esteem that helps build confidence and the courage to try and experience new things in life . The more self-love generated , the more self-worth is created and demonstrated . <p> To reinforce a childs self-love , here are some simple techniques you and your spouse can apply that help children remember more of those " I love mes " on a daily basis : <p> 1 . Practice the " Love Hug : " This is a wonderful exercise for young children to practice everyday . Have them hug themselves while saying , " I love me , I love thee , I love myself in every way , every day ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they go to sleep or when they wake up in the morning to remind them to love themselves . <p> 2 . Create an " I LOVE ME " Jar : In a jar or box with a lid , put strips of paper which a parent or child can write loving thoughts or activities to do everyday . It could state an activity that promotes loving and caring for themself or things that they love about themselves . <p> 3 . Make a screensaver : Especially for preteen or teens , have them create a screensaver on their computer that endorses the I Love Me message . It is a subtle , subliminal way for them to see the loving message everyday . Examples : " Everyday Live Loving Kindness to Myself and Others " or " Its Cool to Love Me . " <p> 4 . Practice making loving decisions : Our daily life decisions reflect the amount of care and love we have for ourselves . Teach children to use two important questions in their decision-making : " Is this ( action , thought pattern , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are the most loving things I can do for myself ( or for others ) in this situation ? " <p> Teaching children how to love themselves can be the antidote to helping children deal with all of the external forces that they get bombarded with on a daily basis . As parents , it is difficult to shield our children from the daily violence they may watch on TV and see in movies , or the damaging messages and actions that children encounter that are said or shown with or without intent . Yet , having the fortitude of enough " I love me " under their belt , gives them the ability to withstand challenging situations and to move forward in a much more positive manner . <p> Lastly , teaching these skills is a long-term investment that will last a lifetime for children and will impact them , from their education to their ability to relate to others to their chosen job or career . And that 's what all parents want , right ?

The idea of meeting an opposite-sex friend for coffee or a movie seems fraught with the possibility for misinterpretation and hurt feelings with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and received mixed reviews .

Even if you consider yourself very close friends , it 's a form of betrayal to vent to your friend about your spouse 's shortcomings , especially without addressing it with your spouse first . <p> 4 . Meet in public places at appropriate times of day . Just like mom used to say , " Nothing good happens after 1:00 a.m. , " the same holds true with your friend .

Introduction to Tantra <p> The link between longevity and orgasm frequency show that married couples who enjoy a regular , satisfying sex life with frequent orgasms are less stressed , less depressed and generally more well physically , mentally and emotionally . This level of satisfaction and well-being is reflected in the marriage in which they share .

Studies site as many as 60 percent of women have faked an orgasmand this practice is not just limited to women . The reasons for faking orgasm are complex . Whether its because one feels like they cant perform , or that they ca n't open up to that level of vulnerability or that by faking one they feel like they can end the intimacy . What results is the most serious of breaches in trust . Faking orgasm is a lie and it leads your spouse , who is trying to love you and bring you pleasure , to feeling like they can not trust the messages you are sending . Breaching trust at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the other aspects of the marriage . <p> Many women mistakenly believe that their pleasure does n't  matter , or they do n't  want to burden their spouse in their own frustrated search for that mysterious and powerful orgasmic release .

For the record , most men get more pleasure and sense of mastery from helping a woman they love to orgasm than having their own climax . Working together to find the path to individual orgasm is the most intimate sharing that exists . It changes everything in a relationship . <p> Finding a language to talk about your sexuality with your spouse is the stumbling block .

For many couples , making the effort to de-stress one anothers life can have remarkable effects on their ability to be intimate . <p> Discovering pleasure together is like pouring cement into a foundation . Physical touch that leads to ecstatic release not only releases hormones and endorphins that promote health and longevity , but also serve as the basis of biological bonding .

To many outsiders it might seem that you are being too fussy or demanding . After all , by your own admission , you experience a " mostly happy life together . " Since realistically , no marriage can be perfect , is n't that enough ? <p> The dilemma you have is in the basic difference in your needs . As you , yourself , say , " He is not a very affectionate person by nature . " So , its not that he does n't  care about you . As a matter of fact , it does seem that when he is reminded of your needs , he does make an attempt . The problem is that because its not who he is , it does n't  hold . <p> When I speak about your needs , I do n't  in any way mean to indicate that you 're needy . It is human to have needs . And , as Dr. Gary Chapman writes in his book , " The Five Love Languages , " each person has a particular modality in which the expression of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that for you , physical touch is the way that you know you 're loved . However , its not the manner in which your husband shows it . Therein lies the problem . From your letter , I cant tell the modality that works for your spouse . According to Chapman , the other four types of expression are verbal , acts of kindness , time or gifts . <p> Of course , one of the main issues when a couple commits to one another is learning how to accept their differences . And there are always differences regardless of how many similarities there are simply because that each of the individuals has been raised by two different families . <p> There are several suggestions I can offer to deal with the situation : <p> 1 . You ought to discuss this with your husband . Women tend to have a better pulse on the relationship and men often do n't  do something about it until they realize there 's a real problem going on . Clearly , you 're getting to the point of serious concern . You need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be presented as what it is a serious concern you 're starting to have . <p> Perhaps by seeing this situation in the light that I 've offered , you will be able to approach your husband in a less frustrated way .

Thus , when your spouse does do something you like , remember to appreciate it when they do it . This reinforcement will help . <p> 3 . There 's also nothing wrong with periodic reminders of what you need . Again , if you realize this does n't  come naturally to them , the fact that he or she is willing to do it when they 're reminded does shows us the they care . <p> 4 . Do check-ins with one another on a regular basis so that you can each have a chance to let the other know what 's working and what needs improvement .

BARRY <p> DepositPhotos Creating boundaries with your in-laws is extremely important to your happiness . <p> " Grandparents are not supposed to be another set of parents ; they already had their chance to raise their own kidsnow it 's your turn . " <p> My husband and I have two kids and live right down the road from his parents ( big mistake ) . They come over about five days a week . My husband thinks it 's no big deal because they do n't stay long , however , it 's just the point that they are intruding when it 's my time to spend with my kids . I work an average of 50 hours a week , so my time with my children is precious and sometimes I feel like my in-laws see my kids as much as me . I feel like grandparents should be grandparents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandkids should only see their grandparents two , maybe four times a month , tops . We need our privacy .

" Anyway , my question is , " How often do you think your in-laws should come over ? " <p> It 's no secret that tension with in-laws can worsen once grandchildren enter the picture . For a daughter-in-law who has had a poor relationship with her husband 's parents from the start , the decision to have a child can intensify the hostility . Even a wife who has previously had a good relationship with her in-laws can become frustrated when they start to visit more often , offer unwanted advice , etc . Even the best in-laws can become controlling and intrusive once they become grandparents ; that 's why it 's important for new parents to be confident and assertive . <p> Here are five common questions asked by new moms in my support group , which include your concerns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How often should in-laws visit their grandkids ? There 's no single correct answer to this question because all of us come from different backgrounds , and therefore we all have different opinions . Some wives complain that their in-laws visit too often , while others feel offended because they do n't visit often enough . Communicate tactfully with your in-laws to discover how their expectations compare to yours . Most importantly , have a discussion with your husband about the frequency and length of visits from parents then try to reach a loving compromise based on his needs and yours . <p> 2 . Is it okay for in-laws to invite themselves over , drop by unexpectedly , and/or walk in without knocking ? Some women are n't the least bit offended when their in-laws drop by uninvited , while others consider such behavior to be disrespectful and intrusive . Rather than letting resentment build , communicate honestly and draw reasonable boundaries . If your in-laws call to invite themselves overor drop by unexpectedlyyou can say something like , " This is n't a good time for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're free then . " If necessary you can add , " Be sure to call first next time ; I 'd hate for you to waste a trip if I 'm not available . " If they continue to drop by uninvited , do n't feel obligated to answer the door . If you do n't want your in-laws to barge into your house , either ask them to ring the doorbell or simply keep your door locked . ( Keep in mind that you ca n't control whether your husband answers the door when his parents drop by uninvited ; you can only control your own behavior . ) Discuss these issues with your spouse and work toward a win-win solution . <p> 3 . How close should I live to my in-laws ? The answer to that depends on several factors . Are your in-laws respectful of your needs as a couple ? Do you and your spouse frequently argue about his parents ? Are you and/or your husband able to be assertive and draw reasonable boundaries when necessary ? Some women enjoy having their in-laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close relationship with the grandparents , and ( 2 ) they have trustworthy relatives who are happy to help with childcare every now and then . Other women feel smothered when nearby in-laws visit too often , offer unwanted advice , interfere with parenting decisions , and cause marriage disputes . If you have toxic in-laws who are a constant threat to your self-esteem and/or your marriage then it 's wise to have as much distance from them as possible . <p> 4 . To what extent should my in-laws be involved in parenting decisions ? You and your husband have the right and responsibility for making decisions about how to raise your kids . The two of you can turn to others for advice , but ultimately you should value each other 's opinions over your parents ' opinions .

If you seethe with anger whenever your mother-in-law offers her opinion about how you should discipline , feed , and dress your kids , then you are placing too much importance on what she thinks . Her opinions are not fact and she does n't  outrank you . The next time she offers unwanted advice , respond as a confident adult instead of an insecure child . Say things like , " Thanks for your suggestion , but I 've decided to do it this way instead " or " You 're entitled to your opinion " or " You may be right .

Be prepared to decline invitations in a tactful , yet firm manner as needed . Or better yet , initiate holiday plans on your terms before any relatives bring up the subject . Here are some assertive statements you can use to initiate or decline family celebrations : <p> * " We 'd like to invite you to come spend Christmas with us . We 're available December 23rd through the 26th. " * " Thanks for the invitation , Mom , but we 've already made other plans . " * " We ca n't get together for Christmas , but we 're available for Easter if that works for you . " * " We ca n't come to your house for the holidays , but you 're welcome to come to our house instead .

" * " It 's not going to work for us to get together this Christmas , but let 's plan on spending next Christmas together . " <p> 4 .

" <p> Appropriate : " It 's too bad we ca n't get together this Christmas , but we 'll look forward to spending next Christmas with you . " Inappropriate : " You do n't visit us often enough . Our friends ' kids visit them a lot more than you visit us . " <p> Appropriate : " Thanks for the invitation ! We 'll be glad to stay in a hotel , and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Inappropriate : " It 's very disrespectful of you to limit which dates we can visit you ; we 'll come and go when it 's convenient for us . We are your parents ; do n't  insult us by asking us to stay at a hotel . " <p> 5 . Learn to let your parents , in-laws , siblings and relatives be upset with you . Just because your mother-in-law is angry or hurt does n't mean you did something wrong . Do n't cave in just because your brother accuses you of being uncaring . Stand firm even if your aunt gossips about you , glares at you or gives you the silent treatment . Rather than apologizing or giving excuseswhich puts you in an inferior positionmake assertive statements such as these : <p> * " I 'm sorry you 're disappointed , but we 've made our decision .

RIVKIN , M.A. , M.F.T. <p> BigStockPhoto If your spouse goes into a rage , professional help is required . <p> When a couple is in a disagreement and one person becomes so angry and it becomes rage , how are you supposed to handle it ? Do you walk away and let them calm down ? Do you try to calm them down at that moment ? I love my husband , but when we do n't agree sometimes his anger turns to rage and its very scary ! Please , help me to understand . <p> There is a significant difference between anger and rage . Anger can be viewed as a scale that ranges from minor irritation to intense rage . It can be very scary indeed when the scale tips toward rage . Most of us do n't  have any idea what to do when someone we love becomes that angry . Do we leave them alone until they calm down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry back ? Will that enrage them more ? Can you even reason with someone who is that mad ? Do you have to protect yourself from their anger ? We may attempt to want understanding as to why our spouse becomes enraged , but its not possible in the heat of the moment . What it comes down to is that if you 're scared , there 's a big problem that goes beyond your need for understanding . <p> Use this scale to determine your spouses anger level , then use the tips to handle the situation accordingly . <p> Low Level Anger : The lower end of the anger scale starts with minor irritation and annoyance . For instance , you 're late again , and your spouse has been waiting for you . When you finally arrive , their response might be , " Geez , why are you always so late ? Its so frustrating ! " Note that your spouses reaction in this situation could be viewed as minor , not escalating into something more intense . <p> Medium Level Anger : The middle range of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , your spouses response in the above scenario might be , " Youre always so damn late . I cant trust you . I do n't  even know how you can hold down a job because you cant even get to dinner on time . You 're so self-centered . It makes me not even want to make plans with you . " <p> If medium level fighting seems to be the norm in your relationship , you need to establish ground rules for fair fighting now . These rules would include : <p> 1 . Take a time out until both of you have calmed down . This rule needs to be established ahead of time and adhered to no matter what ! <p> 2 . Call a truce . This means that you agree to drop the conflict immediately so you can do what you have to do , but then set up a time to deal with it later . <p> 3 . Begin to address the deeper feelings underlying the " lateness " issue . You are both getting triggered and are in danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be accomplished by using my " First Argument Technique " of peel , reveal and heal . <p> Rage : If the above scenario now includes feeling scared and fearful , the argument has tipped the scales into rage . Your spouses enraging response might be , " If you keep this up , you 're gon na force me to lose it ! I 've never been so mad at anyone in my life ! You purposely did this to hurt me . I 've had it ! " ( This does not include the fowl language that often accompanies these tirades . ) <p> At this point you 're scared , and there 's no way to reason with your enraged husband or wife . This is a very serious problem that can not be taken lightly . You should never be scared in your marriage . A disagreement with your partner never warrants rage . Rage is a form of abuse and is never justified unless it 's in response to someone being raped , attacked or molested . <p> If this is the first time that rage has happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no simple techniques to make everything right in that moment . It is not your job to calm this person down . It is your job to walk away and/or get out of the situation if you are scared . Its a sign of a deep psychological problem that warrants immediate attention . Your choices are anger management classes , psychotherapy or consultation with a spiritual advisor . ( If you 're really feeling in danger , you may need to leave temporarily until you can get professional help . ) Yes , you both need help to break this cycle . <p> Remember , this is n't about never getting angry . Its about where the anger falls on the scale . So check the scale and address the anger issues accordingly . <p> Sharon M.

You 're all individuals with your own histories , feelings and responses . That means that each new relationship into which you enter will layer on new histories and feelings and , probably new responses . This " baggage " is something you carry around forever . And , of course , when you marry you bring all your baggage from past relationships to the new relationship . By baggage , I also mean past hurts , happiness and attitudes . <p> For example , you have developed ways of dealing with situations from your family of origin . If you are the youngest child in a family , perhaps you expect more attention from others than would a middle child . If you have come from a bad personal relationship , you may anticipate similar behavior from the new spouse that you received from the old one . A man whose former life partner did all the packing of suitcases for travel may assume that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with sisters could use sarcasm as a way of dealing with problems rather than straight talk . All of these are examples of " baggage " from a prior life . <p> It is important that you recognize your new partner as an individual and not as a reincarnation of an old partner . It is also important that couples adapt to each other , rather than continuing to behave as they did in their prior relationshipsbe that intimate or family of origin relationships . If the assumptions and the actions from the past are brought to the new family , without adjustments for the new person , this couple can never get close or build a new future together . <p> You must learn to separate the new wife from the old , who dumped you or not look at the new husband as that ex-husband who cheated on you .

Assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse as you previously received from your ex-spouse is patently unfair . For example , tightening the purse strings in the new relationship because your former girlfriend ran up the credit cards , may destroy your marriage almost before it begins . Showing jealousy when your new husband talks to a female co-worker because your ex cheated on you is not a good way to start the new marriage . And , expecting to be the center of attention throughout the marriage , as you were in your mother 's home because you were the baby of the family , even after you become a new father is simply unrealistic . <p> The reality is a simple one . What we learn from our parents growing up shapes our entire lives , but that does n't mean you ca n't adjust and change . As you grow older and mature , hopefully you adjust to new situations .

PHILLIPS <p> BigStockPhoto Some open communication and simple steps can keep your marriage just as fresh as the day you met . <p> Some people may think that because I 'm a divorce attorney I do not mind when a marriage fails . Nothing could be further from the truth ! As I sit across the desk from many heartbroken clients and listen to their reason(s) for the failure of their marriage , my first question to him/her is whether I can help save the marriage . Perhaps counseling is what I recommend or sessions with a trusted other , like a priest , rabbi or minister to explore remedies for salvaging the relationship . I pride myself on having saved some marriages during my 25 years in practice and would very much like to see people work things out , if they can . I also have come to realize that had they tried one or more of the following ten suggestions , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks in the first place . <p> 1 . Delineate " yours , " " mine " and " ours . " If you have finances that should be placed in each of the three categories ( like you have an inheritance and he has a savings account he accumulated before the marriage , and you also have a checking account to which you both contribute ) have an upfront conversation about those assets and what belongs to whom . Moreover , talk about your time away from " together " activities , like he wants to bowl with the guys on Tuesday nights and you want to attend your Yoga class on Wednesday evenings . Respect these important delineations . Doing so will make the relationship stronger . <p> 2 . Carve out time to be together . Sure , you 're working , attending meetings , keeping the house up , car-pooling , making the kids do their homework , etc ; but how important are all those things if your marriage falls apart ? Make time to do things together that you both enjoy . This could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take regular vacations without the kidsat least a couple of long weekends and , better yet , a couple of long vacations ( more than a weekend jaunt ) . Commit to a weekly date night and make it as unbreakable as that all-important staff meeting at work . <p> 3 . Take care of yourself . Spend time every day on your appearance and your physical well being . Work out regularly , eat healthy and stay fit . Not only will your spouse like looking at you , but you 'll feel better about yourself . <p> 4 . Make sure communication goes both ways . Many relationships fail because of misunderstandings . Effective communication skills are necessary if your relationship is going to survive . If there is a hint or vibe that your spouse is disconnected or you are unhappy about something , do not ignore those signals or feelings . Approach them and suggest an open discussion . You may be frustrated , angry or hurt and so may he or she , but always stay calm and reasonable . Your goal should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so is through open and direct communication . <p> 5 . Criticize gently . Do n't judge too harshly . If you criticize , do so the same way you would want others to criticize you . Be kind and considerate . <p> 6 . Deal as a team with issues involving your children . Yes , a child changes the dynamics of a relationship , but a child does not need to destroy the sanctity of your marriage . Accept the fact that children will have problems and do n't be reluctant to get outside help to handle them if that is what it takes to preserve the stability of your marriage . <p> 7 . Never stop courting one another . Gifts , compliments and a loving embrace go a long way , especially when they are a surprise to your spouse . Send unexpected greeting cards , slap a Post-It note where you know your mate will find it , keep those flowers coming in a " just because " way . Treat your spouse with the same courtesies you did when you were dating . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your partner all over again . <p> 8 . Keep the flame burning . Keep your romance alive despite the chaos and craziness life can present from living in the midst of sheer reality . Resolve to offer up romantic suggestions for your spouses pleasure , even if only occasionally , like cooking her favorite meal when you know she 's had an impossible day or entice him into a bubble bath with you just for the fun of it . Little gestures like these from time-to-time can ensure that the flame you once had can and will burn forever . <p> 9 . Spell out your terms of endearment . Call out the expectations for one another in the form of the " terms " of your relationship together and put them in a contract if you like . Unlike a prenuptial agreement , this instrument will simply clarify and document those needs and wants that mean a lot to one another . For example , though he typically runs late , your agreement might specify those times when he agrees not to be late ; she may agree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically has little restraint as she traipses through the mall . Discussing these boundaries , as well as your needs and wants can prevent either of you from stepping over the line and causing irritation , ultimately serving as a great way to keep your marriage much healthier . It is often the disappointments ( needs and wants , gone unexpressed ) that bring down a marriage . <p> 10 . Renegotiate your contract : Marriage is like any other contract : its terms and conditions must be reviewed and updated . Your relationship will evolve and your needs and wants right along with it . A good time to review , update or revise your contract with each otherwhether it is verbal or writtenis just before or after your anniversary .

It has been said that when one must resort to foul languagemale or femaleit is because he/she lacks the intelligence to compose their words in any other fashion . Talk to her like you did on the day that you met her . <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you are taking your wife out on a date , polish up your social skills and open her car door , leave her at the curb if it is raining , and when the night is almost over and you suggest a midnight stroll , walk on the outside nearest to the cars . Chivalry is not dead , just dormant . <p> 3 . Learn to dance . You will feel much more confident on the dance floor , rather than seated in a chair , while watching your wife " cutting a rug " with your best friend . Suggest a dance class with your wife and learn how to salsa , tango or ballroom dance . Anything is better than awkwardly watching from afar . <p> 4 . Get rid of your outdated disco-dating clothes . Unless you are a part of the mob or studying for the priesthood , the all black , monotone look from head to toe , including your hair and mustache is a little too harsh . <p> 5 . White socks are goofy if not worn with confidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clean , new dress socks to go with your corporate image . Do n't  wait for your wife to throw them away , do it for her . P.S. Black dress socks with tennis shoes is another roadblock to impressing your wife with your stylish flair . <p> 6 . If you are a non-smoker , you are ahead of the game . Nicotine-stained teeth and smoke-filled clothes are two strikes you cant afford to have against you . Plus , your wife will appreciate the extra years you are around , sharing your life with her . <p> 7 . Brush up on your dining skills . Keep your fingers off of her dinner roll ; drink from your own wine glass and never use a toothpick in her presence . <p> 8 . Do n't  change the color of your hair just because your favorite actor changed his . There is something about a guy with obviously dyed or highlighted hair that is not appealing to most women , much less your wife . The same rule applies to the eyebrows , too ! <p> 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your wifes world , neglecting your own interests and hobbies . Find a separate interest you can enjoy alone or with your friends , even if it is only once in awhile . <p> 10 . Do n't  flirt with her girlfriends . If you think having her friends notice you will impress your wife and make her want you more , think again . You will be on the couch before you can utter the words " I 'm sorry . " <p> 11 . Let her know that you take your marriage seriously . Some obvious signs that you take pride in yourself and your marriage are maintaining a job , not quitting one job until you have another , coming home on time if you say you will be home for dinner , being dependable and true to your word , offering to help with the kids and the chores , never discussing personal marital issues with another person unless it is with a counselor or a trusted friend that you are absolutely sure is wanting and willing to give sound advice , and always being upfront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss . <p> 12 . Offer a listening ear . Women like to " vent " and enjoy the dialog between another person , especially their husband . Turn off the television and listen with both ears . Your wife can tell if you have one eye on the basketball score and another on your smartphone . Whatever you do , do n't  make the mistake of asking her something she just talked to you about several minutes earlier . <p> 13 . Wax . Take a good look at your back , nose and ears and decide if you need some hair removal . Ask your wife for her opinion and heed her advice . <p> 14 . If you need glasses , for goodness sakes wear them . Squinting to see a movie , a menu , or a road sign is not as attractive to your wife as a hip , chic pair of designer specs . <p> Okay , guys , armed with a little know how , go out there and make your wife feel special , and not just for today . 113805 @qwx733805 
@@79604710 @1104710/ <p> Have phrases like this gone by the wayside ? Do you wonder what happened to your spouses interest in sex ? Is there an absence of desire and passion ? Do you want to fall for your sweetheart all over again ? You can make it happen ! Even if the well of sexual intimacy has gone all but dry in your marriage , it is truly possible to get things flowing again . Armed with a bucket of insightful tools , you 'll be on your way to restoring sexual intimacy in your marriagethe most important relationship in your life . <p> In my first two articles on sexless marriage , I addressed some of the basic factors that affect the demise of intimacy and sexuality in relationships . In looking at intimacy through the lenses of neurobiology , personal history , and interpersonal dynamics , it is clear that there is no singular root cause for the decline of sexual intimacy within a marriage . If you havent had a chance to read the first two installments in this seriesor if you 'd like a refresherthe background on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As I noted in my second article in this series , " Whether the decline in sexual connection is rapid or sluggish , the results are the same ; the marriage suffers when the bonding power of sexual intimacy disappears . " This installment , the third and final of the series , focuses on providing the valuable tools and insights you need to rebuild and foster intimacy in your marriage . By utilizing the tips offered , the bonds of your marriage will become stronger and healthier than ever . As your connection with your spouse grows stronger , your sex life will begin to enliven and progress . Given time , your sex life will improve dramatically as a result of the tender , loving care given to all aspects of the relationship ! <p> If you are like most of my clients , you want your sex life to be back on track immediately . This is understandable , but remember that patience is truly critical ! The process of rebuilding sexual connection takes dedication and effort . In general , sexual intimacy deteriorates over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual connection often results from a series of unresolved hurts and ruptures in the marriage . <p> Remember , too , that sexual disconnection can also result from a history of emotional injuries that were carried into the marriage from previous personal history . No matter the source , it will take time and patience to address and resolve the emotional damage that leads to the destruction of intimacy . Given that sexual intimacy within a marriage is far more than mere sexual intercourse , it is vital to appreciate that simply " having more sex " will not create the healthy and delicious sexual connection that lasts a lifetime . <p> Simply put , a persons psychological history ( recent and distant ) affects the ability to connect intimately . From an early age , defenses are unconsciously put up when psychological threats and injuries occur . The psyche does this automatically to protect against further mental and emotional injuries . Unfortunately , these defensive walls are difficult to tear down once they are in place . Indeed , these walls can be beneficial in protecting against psychological damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also keep intimacy and love at bay . The walls that were once erected to keep a person psychologically " safe " are the very same walls that often prevent vulnerability and intimacy with a safe and loving partner . <p> Unconscious defense mechanisms are often at the root of sexual disconnection . It takes work to become aware of the behavior patterns that prevent loving intimacy ; it takes even more work to dismantle the unhealthy walls to allow true intimacy . In truth , little slights and injuries routinely occur even in the best of marriages . <p> When a couple works to continually keep communication clean and healthy , the natural psychological hurts that occur within a marriage are resolved quickly . When a couple does n't  communicate well , the slights and injuries remain unresolved ; as a result , additional layers and walls are often built that obstruct intimacy and love . In fact , many barriers to true intimacy are the result of pre-marriage relationship injuries . Whether psychological injuries are caused in childhood or in adulthood , the psyche holds on to unresolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , former relationships , etc. ) are not resolved and are unconsciously carried into the marriage , the " ghosts " of these untended issues are often unintentionally exacerbated within the marriage . <p> " In offering a basic outline of strategies to restore sexual intimacy , its important to remember that emotional safety is key . " <p> The psyche responds by shouting , " This is n't safe ! Close off ! Hold back ! Do n't  let yourself be exposed ! " It is no wonder , then , that sexual intimacy suffers when hurts build and fester over time . Through appreciating the complexity of sexual disconnection , spouses can cultivate an attitude of patience and understanding as the rebuilding process occurs . <p> In offering a basic outline of strategies to restore sexual intimacy , its important to remember that emotional safety is key . The psychological vulnerability that is critical to intimate sexual connection flourishes when partners feel safe with each other . To promote the necessary emotional safety , remember these vital points : <p> A ) It takes time to build connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  lose hope . <p> B ) As steps are taken to deepen intimacy , it is important that partners provide each other with consistent emotional safety ; take great care to avoid destructive comments or behaviors that may be part of your old patterns . <p> C ) Promote new , loving behaviors by offering consistent , heartfelt expressions of gratitude to your spouse ; loving connection will grow when you remind your sweetheart day in and day out how much he or she means to you . With those basics under your belt , you 're ready for these 10 straightforward tips that have the potential to rock your world ! <p> 1 . Communication is key : While this first tip may not sound sexy , it is the most critical element for creating true intimacylearn to communicate consistently in an open , honest , and respectful way . Work tirelessly to communicate openly and effectively with your partner . Use " I " messages , and steer clear of blame . ( If you need a tune-up on healthy communication , take a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 . Make time to connect : Building intimacy takes time and energy . When spouses become disconnected , effort is required to " find each other " again . At this stage , its important to spend gentle time with each other . Take walks together . Make time to sit and relax over a cup of coffee or tea . Have quiet time as you garden together . Whether you ride bicycles , play cards , or cook as a duo , its important to engage in the " we " activities that you once found bonding . Note : spending time " zoning out " together in front of the television or with computers does not count as " connective time ! " Relating and interacting builds healthy connection ! The more you bond with your partner in daily life , the closer your partner will feel to you . Consistent , positive interactions build connection , safety , and trust in the relationship . Even simple , positive interactions that are focused on familiar household tasks and daily routines have enormous bonding power . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Note : spending time " zoning out " together in front of the television or with computers does not count as " connective time ! " " <p> 3 . Focus on the positive : Strive to remember what first drew you to your husband or wife . Focus on his or her assets , not any faults or weaknesses . When you pay attention to the positive aspects of your spouse , you will foster a more loving connection . By offering frequent , genuine compliments and gestures of appreciation , your spouse will feel more connected and loved . A focus on building kindness and warmth in the relationship will foster your foundation of safety and trust . <p> 4 . Get to the heart and history of the issues : As safety is built in the relationship , you will be able to begin addressing the issues that drove you apart . Without resorting to blame or judgment , each spouse can benefit by writing out a personal timeline that reflects when and how sexual and intimate connection began to decline . Understanding what went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issues that created disconnection . The support of a professional psychotherapist can be very helpful as these issues are processed . <p> 5 . Clear resentments : Make a respectful list of any unresolved resentments that exist between you and your spouse . Many couples resort to bouts of hostility and anger , passive-aggressive exchanges , or " burying " issues . When issues are not resolved , they become " invisible , " giant-sized boulders that make true intimacy impossible . As you and your partner discuss and resolve past hurts and resentments , the emotional distance between you will begin to diminish . Here , again , the support of a trusted professional can be extremely helpful . <p> " The more positive acts you notice , the more bonding intimacy you will create . " <p> 6 . Build your foundation : As you build a new , strong foundation for your relationship , make a conscious effort to communicate openly . Avoid returning to familiar , old behaviors that will tempt you to shut down or avoid connecting with your spouse . While avoidance may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually creates serious problems . So , with the goal of a healthy marriage in mind , smile and make time to discuss issues as they occur . If the ghosts of unresolved issues arise now and again , tend to them as quickly as possible . Be patient as you and your spouse clear your history of the issues that created barriers between you . This process takes a great deal of energy , but the long-term benefits are well worth the effort . As you focus on building safety and trust with each other , do n't  be surprised if gestures of loving kindness begin to occur spontaneously . Notice and thank your partner for any acts of intimate connection . Whether your spouse offers you a hug , a loving look , or a gentle kiss , express gratitude for the gesture of connection . The more positive acts you notice , the more bonding intimacy you will create . <p> 7 . Strengthen your " checking in " skills : As you continue to move forward to build a strong foundation of trust and security that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your spouse . Strive each day to let your spouse know you care ; this builds greater trust and security . Interactions may be as simple as calling or sending a short text or two during the workday . It can also be helpful to set aside time each evening to have a " 10 minute check-in " to see how your partner is feeling and faring ! Such little acts of connection really matter in the long run . Your spouse will be able to experience your care and concern when you slow down the process . When the focus remains on restoring connectionrather than racing to have sexyour partner will be far more likely to respond positively to caring , gentle physical advances . Once it becomes part of your daily routine , the " checking in " process will become a natural and vital component of your marriage ; you 'll wonder how you lived without it ! Remember to use the " checking in " process frequently as you move toward increasing your sexual connection . Strive to make communication and connection a vital , unifying aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trust will form the ideal foundation for a warm and loving physical connection . <p> 8 . Moving into physical intimacy : Once both partners feel ready to begin connecting on a physical level , its important to proceed slowly . Although one partner may be wanting to race to have intercourse , its vital to wait until both ready . Moving slowly allows a couple to establish greater safety and connection . As you begin to connect physically , learn to touch each other without sexual contact . Make time to cuddle with each other . Explore non-erogenous zones . Stroke your partners back , neck , or shoulders . Massage each other in a non-sexual manner . Gentle , tender kisses are often welcomed . At this stage , it is critical that partners allow each other to become open and vulnerable in a slow and respectful manner . <p> " When the focus remains on restoring connectionrather than racing to have sexyour partner will be far more likely to respond positively to caring , gentle physical advances .

Take care to keep communicating with your partner , for old patterns might want to slip in . A vigilant , love-filled attitude will keep you moving forward . <p> 10 .

When both partners feel that the time is right , the intimacy you have worked so hard to build now allows for loving sexual intercourse .

Use these tips to stay fit , healthy , and perform well at any age.BY MARY JAYNE ROGERS PH.D . <p> DepositPhoto Age is but a number . Take care of yourself and your environment and you might lose count . <p> " Think of your environment as the blanket you wrap yourself in . You want it to be comfortable and soothing ; not abrasive and smelly ! " <p> There is much ado about aging these days . We worry about looking old , feeling old , getting old , and being old . We definitely do not feel good about old . Old conjures up thoughts about osteoporosis , sexual dysfunction , loss of sight , loss of hair , loss of hearing , loss of mind and the list goes on . <p> Satchel Paige said , " How old would you be if you did n't know how old you are ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The problem with the question is that in order to answer it , we have to make an assumption about age . What does it feel like to be 30 , 50 , 80 ? Is how " old " we feel completely related to how long we have been alive ? <p> I once interviewed a gentleman who was 93 years old ( chronologically ) . He hiked 2 miles in the foothills of Albuquerque twice per week , attended the gym to lift weights , and oh by the way , had a 63-year-old girlfriend .

That moment should be more memorable ; it changed my life after all . Instead , that memory on the operating table has been lost in the haze of the passing years ( and whatever they give you in that oxygen mask to make you feel so freaking loopy right before surgery ) . When I woke , I had a new reality . The tumor the doctors had removed from my leg was n't a benign nerve tumor . It was n't a fatty cyst .

" Some of these items are ridiculously obvious and some are just hurtful but I 've always been struck by five phrases that are meant to be comforting but end up being anything but . Here they are : <p> 1 . " You are going to be okay . " <p> It seems like the right thing to say , it is what you really wish will happen for your friend or family member , but it also downplays the fact that this is a serious battle , one that might end up taking the fighters life . <p> Instead : It is okay to acknowledge that your loved one might lose this battle . It is okay to say , " I 'm scared " ( this is best followed up with a giant hug ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " be there " instead . <p> 2 . " Look on the bright side , its not ( fill in the blank with other horrible illness ) . " <p> Pains are not comparable . They just are n't  . The last thing someone fighting through their own cancer battle needs to hear is about how it could be worse . It immediately discounts any pain they are going through because at least its not as bad as XYZ . <p> Instead : Try acknowledging how hard the road ahead is . It seems counter-intuitive , but honestly it is far more comforting . <p> 3 . " You got this ! ! " or " You are going to beat this ! " <p> I know this one is particularly hard for cancer fighters to hear . Not because we do n't  want to be strong , but because the outcome of this battle is not really in our hands . Otherwise , would n't every cancer patient end up healed if all it took was determination and tenacity ? <p> Instead : Ask about their treatment plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even better , how you can support their family . If they want to talk about the possibility of not " beating this " let them . One of the most beautiful discussions I 've ever had was when a good friend asked me , " So what if you do n't  beat this ? What can I do to help you and your family ? " <p> 4 . " Let me know what you need " <p> No . Nope . Nada . This phrase should be eliminated from the human lexicon . When going through a trauma , you are usually the last person who can see what you need . In fact , it is often exhausting to come up with a way someone can help . <p> Instead : Be active . Offer specific help and if your friend says " no " then find a way to take a load off without asking permission . Shovel a driveway or pick up a kid from school . You know what one of my favorite things anyone ever did for me when I was sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go alone . <p> 5 . " Everything happens for a reason " <p> Maybe you actually believe this and that 's okay , but please do n't  say it to someone diagnosed with cancer ( or going through anything hard , really ) . That phrase and all the other similar sentiments are hardly comforting to most of the cancer fighters I 've come to know and love . It makes you feel like you lost the life lottery , like you pulled the short straw , like no one out there ( or up there ) cares about your life and apparently you should be okay with that . <p> Instead : You can say , " This sucks . " Even if you somehow believe that cancer happens " for a reason " you can also acknowledge how incredibly sucky it is . So so sucky . <p> Sometimes after reading a list like this it can feel impossible to find the right thing to say to someone battling a life-threatening illness , but I really think it comes down to two things . First , acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , offer love and specific support . That 's it . You ca n't make it better and your well-meaning sentiments cant make it better .

@@79604713 @1104713/ <p> 4 Steps to Restoring Intimacy in Your MarriageIntimacy is a vitally important part of any marriage . Use these simple steps to get it back and create the loving marriage you really want to have.BY LIAM NADEN <p> DepositPhoto Do n't confuse intimacy with sex . Intimacy can be seen in touch and emotional closeness . <p> " Find ways to get your partner to feel good about you emotionally . " <p> Is your marriage lacking intimacy ? Has the affection gone from your relationship ? Although the first ( and most obvious ) sign that things have cooled between the two of you is a lack of sexor even mundane sex where you feel no connection with your partner " intimacy " covers other things as well . It can be touching , holding each other , kissing , cuddling ... any form of physical contact that creates a positive emotional response in you . <p> Unfortunately , for many couples the intimacy has all but gone from their marriage . They 're simply " going through the motions " of marriage without any signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person than the other . Many times , one is going through emotional distress due to a lack of intimacy , while the other might seem to hardly notice . All too often , if the intimacy is not restored between a couple , it can result in the end of the marriage , with one ( or both ) people deciding to look for intimacy elsewhere . <p> If you are wanting to bring back the intimacy into your marriage there are four steps you can take . They can help create that zing again between you and your spouse . <p> 1 . Identify the real reason why the intimacy has gone . Many times people relate a lack of intimacy to problems in the marriage and the conviction that " he or she does n't find me attractive any more . " But usually there are other reasons outside of the marriage that cause one or both partners to pull away . They can be stresses and pressures from other areas of life : finances , career or other family members . <p> It 's important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse that are causing you to feel unhappy and less interested in being intimate and affectionate . By reducing other pressures , you and your partner will feel better about life and about each other . <p> 2 . Focus on reconnecting emotionally with your spouse . If your husband or wife is pulling away from you emotionally and not giving you the intimate affection you want and need , it 's often tempting to try to get them physical without warming them up emotionally first . Find ways to get your partner to feel good about you emotionally . This can be as simple as making them laugh ( with a funny story or joke ) , getting them to remember a happy or fun occasion you both shared , or doing something that you both enjoy . Add some lightness and fun back into your marriage and you set the stage for intimacy to follow , naturally . <p> 3 . Understand your partner 's intimacy style . Not everyone likes to be touched ! Some people are naturally more physical than others and it comes down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or you ) find that touch is a bit " creepy " ( at least to start with ) , experiment with other ways to start an intimate connection . It could be with sound ( saying something complimentary or affectionate ) or sight ( a particular look or smile you might give them ) . <p> These are very overlookedyet powerfulways to rebuild intimacy . It does n't always start with the physical , although if you discover your partner 's intimacy style , the physical is much more likely to follow . <p> 4 . Keep the pressure off . People can become very distressed when the intimacy wanes in their marriage . They can become hurt , angry , depressed and even irrational in their behavior if they are starved of intimacy and affection . However , give it time and allow intimacy to return rather than forcing it to happen or getting impatient .

The vibrator maintains its iconic , U-shaped construction made from 100% medical-grade silicone that feels soft and silky to the touch and is free from phthalates , latex and BPA . The vibrator is also 100% waterproof . <p> The remote control button configuration has evolved to become even more straight forward in its use . The up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotate through the various vibration modes . With the remote control , couples can cycle through five different vibration modes . However , and this is where the fun really begins , when using the app couples can play with an additional five vibration modes in addition to creating their own personalized modes . <p> You might be thinking that an app makes things too complicatedand that might be true if it were n't such a great app . The team at We-Vibe clearly understood that you 're not pulling out the phone to play with some angry birds , you 're using it to play with your partner . After the initial registration and pairing with the vibrator , which literally took just seconds when following the instructions on the screen , the app opens up to a simple display of the first vibration mode and up/down buttons to independently control the motors of the external clitoral vibrator and the internal G-spot vibrator . Tapping the mode display will begin the vibration in a visually scrolling manner as if you were looking at a cardiographwe do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is turned on . Swiping left and right will change the vibration mode . <p> Click on the navigation button and you can create your own vibe . Again , this process is extremely simple . Write a name , select the vibration mode you want , select how long you want the vibration to last , and then adjust the intensity . The only thing missing was that you could n't independently adjust the two motors when personalizing your vibe intensity ( perhaps an app update can include this feature ) . You can add as many vibration modes into your personal vibe setting with their own independent times and synced motor intensities . For example , you could set the Pulse vibration for 20 seconds with an intensity of 1 , followed by the Echo vibration for 30 seconds with an intensity of 2 , followed by the Bounce vibration for 3 minutes and 21 seconds with an intensity of 10 . The order of these vibrations can be moved around in a drag and drop manner . When you 're done and hit play on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music that you 've written to help you reach a crescendo . Applause is definitely in order . <p> One more thing with the app your spouse can remotely control the vibrator from anywhere ! Whether you 're in the other room or across the globe , the We-Vibe 4 Plus let 's you and your spouse stay connected with the personal vibrations you created together . <p> While all couple vibrators strive for the same goal of gratification , the We-Vibe 4 Plus enables couples to experiment and exploreand then save the path to the pleasure they 've found . <p> Positives : * It has an amazing , free app that 's easy to use ( iOS and Android ) * Remote play , keeps couples connected when they 're apart* Renewable battery charges in 4 hours , lasts up to three hours per charge* Medical-grade materials , 100% waterproof

BILL &amp; GINGER BERCAW <p> DepositPhoto Watching porn can be a great sexual stimulant , but it can also become a problem . Know the dangers . <p> " We hear story after story about requests from one partner to another to engage in sexual behaviors viewed online . " <p> The issue around pornographys influence on sexuality has never been more important to address than it is today , simply because pornography has never been more integrated and relevant in our culture . <p> Our purpose here is not to assess it from a moral perspective but to ask , " What are porns practical implications for relationships ? " First of all , we must acknowledge the main reason for using pornto increase pleasurable sexual stimulation and intensity . And the fact is , few products deliver on what they promise the way porn does . <p> So for something that so consistently produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it worth it ? " We believe you should seriously consider this question if you or and/or your partner use porn individually or view it together to enhance your bedroom experience . <p> On the upside , viewing online pornography can provide a quick and convenient means to a pleasurable end . Some people can use porn in moderation , without hiding it from their spouse and without obvious detrimental effects on their relationship . In our experience this group represents the minority . Sometimes couples look to porn to spice things up in the bedroom . When viewed together , it can help couples to discuss their sexual preferences and experiment with what they see . <p> However easy to access and ubiquitous it may be , it is a potentially addictive process for about 5-10 percent of users . It tends to hook at-risk people hard and fast , leading them far past their originally intended boundaries . Like other addictions , people usually do n't  know they are at-risk until they are already hooked . We have seen many people lose their careers and families and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Editor 's Note : Within the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) , the official manual used within the psychiatric community , sex addiction was debated , but ultimately excluded from diagnosis in this edition . This article from Time magazine explores the continuing conversation . <p> This was not typically the case before the early 90s when it took at least some effort to purchase a magazine or video , not to mention the risk of embarrassment if witnessed doing so . Not only did the internet make porn infinitely more accessible , affordable and anonymous , it also delivered the product in a way that was far more stimulating than any magazine or video . In fact , Dr. Patrick Carnes refers to online porns level of intensity as " stimulation beyond the original design " of the human brain . On brain scans , it lights up the reward centers of the brain in a similar fashion to crack cocaine . <p> " Not only did the internet make porn infinitely more accessible , affordable and anonymous , it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulating than any magazine or video . " <p> But let 's say you 're in the 90-95 percent that will not develop a full-blown porn addiction . No problem , right ? <p> Wellthere could be some complicating factors . First of all , on the male side of things , we are seeing a sharp increase in the number of men who struggle with Erectile Dysfunction , Delayed Orgasm and low desire who are otherwise healthy and relatively happy in their relationships . However , they have become so conditioned by the sexual intensity that online porn provides that they are not nearly as responsive to the real thing as they once were . Others need to bring mental images and scenes from their porn use into their sexual times with their partners in order to become aroused . ( You can imagine their partners are not thrilled by these developments ! ) . The good news is that after about 30 days of abstaining from masturbating to porn , they are usually able to resume normal functioning . For some though , the abstaining is not so simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is also the complicating factor of how porn use affects perceptions of sexually normative behaviors and sexual expectations . We hear story after story about requests from one partner to another to engage in sexual behaviors viewed online . Sometimes , the partner is willing and both enjoy the experience , but other times , the request is perceived as offensive or uncomfortable . In other instances , there is no request because one partner spontaneously introduces the behavior . <p> For example , Megan began to notice that her husband , Rick , was becoming rougher and using coarse language during sex that shed never heard him use before . In the past she had appreciated how tuned into her he seemed during sex , but recently it seemed like his mind was somewhere else . <p> When she asked him about the changes she was noticing , he told her he , " Just wanted to shake things up a little bit . " <p> Megan told him she was all for variety but that she was uncomfortable with his distance and language . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rick attempted anal sex with Megan without any discussion . This activity had never been part of their sex life and Megan was shocked . <p> " What do you think you 're doing ? ! " she exclaimed . That seemed to snap Rick out of his trance . <p> " I just thought it might be fun to try something different , but I guess you are n't  up for that , " he replied . <p> " No , I 'm definitely not and I want to know what has gotten into you lately . Sex used to be so fun , and I always felt so close to you . But now you 're starting to scare me . " <p> Eventually , Rick told Megan that hed been doing some " online research " about sexuality and he had been drawn toward certain porn sites . Megan told him how surprised she was and that she much preferred that they discuss their sex life together as partners instead of secretly developing sexual agendas . She also let him know that she was hurt and concerned that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not okay with him continuing to visit porn sites . <p> " Megan told him how surprised she was and that she much preferred that they discuss their sex life together as partners instead of secretly developing sexual agendas . " <p> It was n't easy for Rick , but he did hear Megan and after several starts and stops he was able to turn away from his attraction to porns intensity . As he gradually moved back in the direction of his and Megans very real sexual intimacy , he was able to appreciate that there was some noticeable sexual intensity there also , but with the benefit of feeling genuinely connected to his wife . <p> Thankfully , Ricks relationship with porn had not reached the level of active addiction , but many others are not so fortunate . It can take an aggressive course of psychological treatment combined with group support to effectively address more deeply entrenched patterns of behavior . Even if it does not rise to this level , masturbating with online porn is an isolating behavior , often done secretly , that involves directing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ones partner . And as in Ricks case , it can influence ones sexual expectations , preferences , style and presence . <p> If you are watching one scene after another of anal sex or ejaculations on faces or threesomes or high-risk sexual scenarios , or hairless genitals , then these things can start to seem normal even if they have never been part of your sexual enjoyment . Granted , for some people , this exposure may be a springboard into a new area of sexual enjoyment . But for many others , it skews their perceptions of normalcy and unrealistically raises the sexual expectations they have of their partner . <p> If you are wondering if it might be fun to watch some porn together , consider this : It might be . But if either one of you does not find this idea appealing , that should be enough to nix it ( and without judging that persons reluctance negatively ) . <p> However , if both of you really want to do this together , be aware of the potential to become dependent on porn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a short-term boost , but you may also need increasing levels of envelope-pushing sexual behavior on screen to get the same boost going forward . <p> Drs .

You may have had to endure a season or a fleeting occasion when your spouse has not been in the mood to make love . When the no-sex or low-sex issue becomes habitual , however , then any couple experiencing this has cause for concern . This is especially so when one party is never in the mood and the other always or usually is . How can a couple attempt to tackle this problem of a no-sex or of a low-sex marriage ? <p> While each of us may not realistically match the national average of 2.5 times per week , it is imperative that the importance of sexual intimacy to marriage is not trivialized .

Do both partners share a similar value when it comes to sexual intimacy ? What other issue could possibly be at the heart of such a problem ? <p> From talking to a number of individuals and couples over time , the one thing I have recognized is that while sex is one of those acts we are prepared to do , it is often not one we prefer to discuss . As a result of this key area of neglect in the relationship , a couple may not even recognize that there is serious disparity in how they view sex . <p> So , if you have this hurdle of no sex or inadequate sex in your marriage than here are seven tips that will help you on the path to sexual healing . <p> Define individual sexual expectations : We all know about Mars and Venus in the bedroom and the reality that men and women can be poles apart when it comes to sexual desire and even their view of sex . Be that as it may , it is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wantsparticularly as this relates to regularity . <p> Acknowledge sexual desire differences : I love sex , but no matter how much sex I have with my husband , he always wants more . I have just come to accept this as a fact of my life . This could also be experienced in the reverse where a wifes desire for sex is greater than her husbands . A couple must learn not to make this issue a deal-breaker , but should allow love and the desire to make their partner happy . Mitigate how they will negotiate the reality of unmatched sexual desire . <p> Develop sensitivity with a low-sexual desire mate : Having acknowledged that there are sexual differences between men and women and that we should pander to our partners needs as much as is humanly or realistically possible , there is always the other side . A spouse who loves to constantly heat it up must still learn how to cool it down . This simply means respecting a partner who has a lesser desire . This means no sexual bullying , begging , manipulating or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow , but it is made easier when the low-desire spouse is also understanding in the situation . At the same time , demanding your " sexual rights " can also be counter-productive and can serve to further fan the flames of resentment in the marriage . <p> Explore , explore , explore : Get to the heart of the issue or issues that may be at the root of inhibited sexual desire . What about un-confessed infidelity and the resulting guilt or a sexual-orientation issue that is hidden ? Does your spouse feel loved and affirmed by you outside of the bedroom ? Are you interested in your spouse as a whole person or do you just want to use their genitals for your sexual release ? Confronting these issues honestly between you may be the first step to sexual healing . <p> Strengthen your intimacy-capacity : We were made for human connection and intimacy . It is this human drive and instinct which motivates us to seek a life partner in the first place . But intimacy in a relationship is not automatic . It must be groomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , communication and couple-time . You ca n't be intimate if you do n't  talk , date or create exclusive time for one another , which ultimately defines your relationship . Making your spouses needs a priority communicates their value to you and is an excellent way of breaking down the barriers to a great sex life . <p> Seek the assistance of a counselor or doctor : The issues which inhibit sexual desire may be deep and psychological or they may be medical . Hormone fluctuations , medication , past sexual trauma , or undiagnosed illness can all have an impact on our desire for sex . What about your sexual " skill ; " do you even know what you 're doing in bed or is your partner turned off by your failure to " take care of business " in the sack ? Before writing your spouse off as a sexual freak , seek professional help together . Therapy , medication or even ideas for improving your sexual skills may be the answer to boosting sexual desire . <p> Bite the bullet and have sex : Okay , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tomorrow night or the next day . But life does not just revolve around you . If you are " me-obsessed " and cant see past your own nose , ask your spouse about how you come across . Do you seem hard , selfish and cruel even ? You just might be shocked about what your spouse reveals . Marriage , by its very definition , is a partnership that should be based on mutual love and respect . And love is about putting the needs of another before your own ; this definitely includes your spouses sexual needs . Am I suggesting that you become your spouses sex slave and that you can never say no to sex ? Of course not ! But compromise and communication are critical to emerging a sex life that you both can be comfortable with and enjoy . And for ladies who love to put emphasis on the need for intimacy in marriage , there is nothing like sexual intimacy to set the ball rolling .

However , you have faith that if your spouse attends meetings that eventually he will receive the support he needs to heal himself . Driving him to the meeting is helpful . <p> How to resolve this dilemma ? Tell your spouse what you are doing . Give him consequences and hold to them , " I have faith in you and in the support you get at AA to heal yourself . However , I will not continue to help you get there when you 're hung over .

However , I wo n't drive you there since the reason you want me to is that you 're too hung over to drive there yourself . I will help you think of ways to get there on your own . I love you . " <p> Here , you are truly helping , not enabling . You are giving them an opportunity and the loving support to take charge of their own healing . Helping is wonderful and valuable .

" <p> How do I get my spouse to open up on issues concerning our relationship ? We never resolve any problems that come up and end up not talking for a month about what happened . It 's become a revolving door of one problem after another and it all leads to silence . Is there a way to approach this to actually start a healthy dialogue . <p> Though certainly not true in all cases , there is some validity to jokes and stereotypes or else they would n't ring true . That having been said , you might have heard that the four words a man hates most are : " We need to talk . " <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , you might be surprised to learn that there are also many reasons that this silent treatment occurs . It has become popular to think in terms of " Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus .

Therefore , cognitive skills , memory , and language processing are all going to vary from each other . An article I read not too long ago also explained that , anatomically , men do not have the ability to verbally express their emotions as articulately as women . <p> Now , all of this may seem like you are doomed .

The natural response is to defend oneself and the likely response is to attack back or shut down . So , raise the issue in more of a matter-of-fact manner assuring him that you want to clarify something so that the two of you can have a better understanding . <p> When you do bring a topic up , you want to phrase it where you are exploring for information about the situation rather than drilling him . Let me offer a concrete example . Let 's say that you were at a party and he wanted to leave early . Instead of asking , " Why did you want to leave ?

The majority of men say that what they want most is to please their wives . Again , through research , it has been found that though women are more emotional , men are more sensitive . They do n't  like feeling inadequate or disappointing to their mates . What this boils down to is a lot of men believing that it is better to be silent than to speak and say the wrong thing . <p> Therefore , its important that you reassure your husband that you do want to know what 's on his mind and that he does n't  have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does take the risk to then speak up , you must be reinforcing of him doing so and not react badly to what he has expressed . <p> Thanks for bringing this matter up .

Looking lovingly at your spouse , complimenting her body , dressed or undressed , with your eyes , gazing directly or allowing your smoldering desire to be evident , should be a key feature in your seduction repertoire . <p> Woo Her With Words <p> As men are visual , women are verbal . We do n't only love to speak but we love to be spoken to . A husband who longs to get it on with his wife should learn to romance her with words of love and desire . Most of us women long to know that our partner 's desire for us transcends our genitals and really is about the wonderful person whom he is still smitten by . So husbands , using your own awkward words can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poetic with a poem by Robert Burns or a simple Hallmark card may do the trick . For you men willing to go all the way , some graphic sexual language may even get you more than you bargained for . The trick is to be in-tuned with your wife 's preferences and to go with the flow . <p> The Hands Have It <p> My husband is a talented chef and welder and I make no bones about communicating just how good he is with his hands . While the voice and the eyes are significant , harnessing the power of touch is a skill that neither husbands nor wives should forget . Massaging feet , temples , necks and shoulders and following with delicious butterfly kisses are great starting points for seduction . Playful tugging at breasts , butts or caressing of the legs , can also be a great way to communicate desire , when the timing is right . <p> Sexualizing Your Relationship <p> The art of seduction lies in the ability to honestly and unashamedly communicate desire , in a way that stimulates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic is where it reflects the general tenor of the marriage , even if sex is not happening as often as you think it should . <p> The truth is that a sexy or sexualized marriage is not necessarily one with loads of straight-up sex , but one where the sexual possibilities are always open . In this regard , communicating love and desire , spending time together , touching and smooching regularly and treating each other like lovers instead of room-mates , are great ways to keep the sexual tone of the marriage alive . When seduction is necessary , it becomes another way of deepening the sexual dimension of your marriage .

" <p> If you 've been together for a substantial period of time , there 's a fair chance that at some point you 'll find yourself saying ( or at least thinking ) these three fateful words : This is n't working . When that happens , these four even more dreadful wordsI want a divorce ( or I want out ) are just a hop , skip , and jump away . And all too often , all that 's standing between these two sentences is guidance from a professional . Before you can seek help , though , you 've got to admit you have a problem . <p> Perhaps your struggling marriage resembles that of Monica and Dan . Two years after the birth of their child they have n't been able to satisfactorily divide parenting responsibilities and constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe you 're more like Chris and Lena , for whom the bank accountand how it should be allocatedis a constant source of friction .

Whatever the details , there usually comes a point when your problems grow too big for you to work through alone . There 's just too much hurt , anger , and misunderstanding . <p> What 's more , if you 're like many married couples , you never even saw the crisis coming . <p> In the stress and chaos of everyday life , its all too easy to lose sight of the ways in which everyday issues can become insurmountable problems over time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely a couple is to divorceand the more evident it is that they might benefit from couple therapy . <p> First , though , you need to recognize when professional help is needed . Here are 10 warning signs of a struggling marriage . Especially if several of these signs are present , seek couple therapy right away : <p> 1 . Few arguments ever get resolved . Most couples have common issues they argue about : money , the division of household labor , in-laws , parenting , and more . And that 's normal ! The idea that happy couples do n't  argue is a complete myth . In fact , prominent couple researcher John Gottman found that even " master " couplesthose who stayed happily married over many yearsargued regularly . Problems begin to creep in when arguments become chronic , personal , and unresolved . <p> When couples find they ca n't resolve key issues in their marriage , the relationship is in trouble . Extreme stonewallinga refusal to give ground or compromiseis actually a reliable predictor of divorce . <p> 2 . You feel like you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending too much moneywe should set up a budget . " " If we want to feel better , we need to get up off the couch and be more active . " " I feel like you are n't  telling me everything . What 's wrong ? " In healthy marriages , these comments might lead to productive discussions , even if a certain amount of conflict takes place first . But in other relationships , similar observations might only spark arguments , tears , misunderstandings , blame , or name-calling . <p> When that 's the case , many individuals might prefer to avoid hot-button topics altogether . If you find yourself avoiding topics and protecting yourself from conflicts , its a sign that there is a lack of safety in your marriage . Its never advisable to blurt out whatever you 're thinking whenever the impulse strikesyou should always avoid being unnecessarily hurtful or angrybut for a marriage to remain healthy , its crucial for the lines of honest communication to remain open . <p> 3 . You find it difficult to reach to your partner for emotional support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbling block for couples . One spouse ( oftenbut not alwaysthe husband ) may see emotions as irrational , undesirable , or unhelpful . In other cases partners may not understand the reasons underlying why the other person feels and reacts a certain way . <p> The truth is , a full , shared emotional life is important for couples . That 's because emotions are what organize and prioritize our lives . No matter what causes emotional disengagement , it drains the life from a marriage . If you no longer trust your spouse with emotional vulnerability , your relationship is at risk . <p> 4 . You find yourself spending less time together for no good reason . We 've all known couples who seem to co-exist as roommates in the same house , living largely separate lives instead of approaching life as partners . While this type of relationship may not be characterized by spectacular blow-ups and window-rattling arguments , its still headed for trouble . <p> Even if your marriage dies with a whimper instead of with a bang , its still dead . Partners who choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disengagement . No , you do n't  have to ( and in fact , you should n't ) spend all your free time with your spouse . But do keep in mind that time is a crucial resource for sustaining intimacy . If you want to spend as little of it as possible with your spouse , something is n't right . <p> 5 . Your arguments often include criticism , defensiveness , and contempt . Once again , all coupleseven very healthy onesargue . The difference is , healthy couples argue without extreme criticism , defensiveness , and contempt . In other words , they remain focused on the issue at hand instead of using the argument as an excuse to attack each other . <p> When conflicts take on patterns that include attacks against a partners character , mind-reading , counter-complaining , and insults or name-calling , damage is being done to the emotional security of the relationship . <p> 6 . It has been months since you showed your partner you needed him or her , or vice versa . In the hustle and bustle ( or outright chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that your spouse knows how you feel about him , or to take for granted what she means to you . But when these feelings remain unspoken and unacknowledged for too long , problems can take root . <p> Shared vulnerability is how partners show and share intimacy . When husbands and wives stop depending on each other , their relationship loses its importance , and closeness is lost . <p> 7 . Anger and frustration over couple issues has turned to apathy and indifference . Especially when important topics are at stake , beware of phrases like , " I do n't  care , " " Do whatever you want , " and " Have it your way . " In researcher John Gottmans two-decade study , the only couples who did n't  argue had grown distant and were headed for divorce . That 's because giving up on an important issue is usually a step toward giving up on the relationship . <p> A complete lack of conflict is n't a sign of an exceptional relationship ; it indicates that you and your partner no longer place enough value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Spouses who give in to apathy and indifference are purposefully moving away from the marriage . <p> " If you find yourself avoiding topics and protecting yourself from conflicts , its a sign that there is a lack of safety in your marriage . " <p> 8 . You find yourself trying to control circumstances rather than trusting your spouse . Controlling actions within a marriage can take many formsfor example , restricting access to money , disapproving of outside relationships , putting the other person down , or playing on a partners emotions to get what you want . No matter how they manifest , controlling actions usually indicate one thing : that the perpetrator is insecure in the relationship . Perhaps he feels injured or misused , or is fearful of how his partner might act if not otherwise influenced . Either way , these efforts at control undermine efforts to rebuild trust . <p> 9 . You do n't  share personal thoughts and feelings without fear of criticism . Say that your partner is being considered for a promotion at work . While a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relocate to a different city . Youd like to discuss the fact that a possible move makes you uncomfortable , but based on past experience , you know that your spouse will accuse you of being " selfish " and " not supportive . " So you bottle up your fears and keep your mouth shut . <p> Fear of your partners lack of care and concern is a sign of an insecure marriage . Managing this fear through withdrawal is a short-term solution to eroding trust , which can threaten a long-term relationship . <p> 10 . A difficult life event has caused strain . Certain life events can place a lot of stress on couples and families . They include : getting married , losing a job , the death of a family member or someone close , a serious illness or disability , the birth of a child , depression or another mental health issue , a natural disaster , children leaving home , addiction , and a crisis with one of your children . <p> The changes to a couples daily routine that these events necessitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can spark dissatisfaction , dysfunction , and conflict . Many times , couples come to therapy while experiencing one or more of these common life events , or soon after . <p> If you and your partner have been facing one or more of these issues for some time and havent made much headway in resolving them , consider making an appointment for couple counseling . And please do n't  feel ashamed that you need to call in a professional . Human relationshipsand especially marriagesare very complicated ; and often our beliefs about how they should work are full of misunderstandings . <p> The good news is that an emotionally focused couple therapist can use the strong emotions you 're feeling to pull you and your spouse back together , instead of allowing those feelings to continue pushing you apart . Making the decision to attend couple therapy may not be easyand therapy itself wont be easy , either ; but if your marriage is on the rocks , taking this step might mean the difference between separating and staying together .

The simple process of organizing your thoughts can do wonders to let your feelings mature into something you can talk about rationally ; and let you see how your partners behavior may be influenced by personality needs . <p> Figuring out your emotions can be as simple as writing about them . Marshalling the forces of language to understand deeper problems and worries forces you to confront the hidden aspects of troubles and to see the ways in which you are hiding or obscuring the deeper truths about what is making you angry in the first place . <p> Instead of fuming and confronting your spouse before you are prepared with what you want to say or with what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a letter helps you see things from more than one angle and maybe even from your spouses point of view . <p> Additionally , your spouse may be much more receptive to your ideas or complaints when reading them with the added distance of a letter .

A letter is much more reserved , much more rational and true . <p> In fact , while writing the letter , you may discover that you do n't  have that much of a problem in the first place , or the problem you " thought " you had was really about something else entirely . <p> A great preliminary gesture to writing a letter to your spouse is to assess your own self and find out the underlying attitudes that you feel may be spurring a crisisand to see the ways in which your personality is influenced by factors like fears , hopes , frustrations , and the coping mechanisms for anger and stress . <p> By taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are coming from and then sitting down and writing about it , you can craft letters that succinctly explain how you feel and why and let your partner know just what you mean . <p> Remember : You do n't  have to give your spouse your letter just because you 've written it .

Yes , they might have the credentials , but when it comes to marriage , some are better then others.BY DR . BRENT BRADLEY AND DR . JAMES FURROW <p> DepositPhoto Be sure you ask these basic questions before you settle on a couples counselor . <p> When the health of your relationship is at stake , you want the right therapist . That means one who is qualified to help you address the issues you are facing and one with whom you and your partner feel comfortable . That means doing more than just Googling " marriage counselor " on the internet and picking the first name that pops up . There are all sorts of therapists , counselors , and coaches out there willing to work on relationship issues , but important differences do existand you need to pay attention to them . <p> Here , we share 10 questions to ask before scheduling an office visit . ( Some answers might be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest . ) <p> 1 . What is your state license and professional affiliation ? Various mental health professionalsfrom psychologists to counselors to social workers to marriage and family therapistsoffer therapy services to couples , and their qualifications can vary greatly . <p> You should not work with a therapist unless he or she is licensed by your state . Beyond that , ask if the professional is a member of a leading professional organization . Membership in a professional organization indicates that the therapist is more aware of recent developments in their field of study . <p> 2 . What approach do you use in couple therapy ? Numerous approaches to couple therapy exist . Some therapists use a specific approach like emotionally focused therapy ( EFT ) or cognitive behavioral therapy . Others describe their approach as " eclectic , " which can mean integrating more than one approach or using techniques from a variety of approaches . <p> We believe that if you 're going to put your relationship and your money in the hands of a professional , you should know that the therapist is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has demonstrated positive results . Three couple therapy approaches that have achieved strong research support are emotionally focused couple therapy , behavioral marital therapy , and integrated behavioral couple therapy . <p> 3 . What kind of training have you had in couple therapy ? Some therapists may mention specific conferences or workshops theyve attended . Others may point to certification programs theyve completed post-graduation . A therapists response to this question will tell you whether their work with couples is something they have invested time and energy in developing , or simply something they offer as a general part of their overall practice . <p> Be wary of therapists who are still practicing what they learned in graduate school 10 years ago . When you ask a therapist about training , they may mention where they went to grad school , what degree they earned , but they should also talk about other training they have received in the years since . <p> 4 . What percentage of your practice is working with couples ? This is very important . The answer to this question will tell you whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of their overall general practice . It gives you a clear way of gauging the amount of current experience the therapist has with couple therapy . <p> Look for a counselor whose weekly caseload is at least 50 percent couple therapy . Experience is important , particularly in EFT , where therapists actively learn from the couples they serve . <p> 5 . Do you mainly meet with partners as a couple or as individuals ? Contemporary scholars do n't  recommend treating couples by working with individual partners in isolation . Without the relationship in the roommeaning both of you presentits more difficult for partners to know or experience what 's changing at a personal level , or in the dynamic between the partners . <p> You want a counselor who sees both of you in-session at the same time almost all of the time over the course of counseling . They may see you each for an individual session early on as part of the assessment , but this should not be the norm . <p> 6 . Do you focus more on strengthening the couple or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you something about how the counselor sees change happening in therapy . Does change happen through helping individuals to revisit childhood and family of origin relationships primarily ? Or does the therapist use sessions to focus on the couples relationship as the basis of change ? <p> " Its okay to let the therapist know that you plan to have an initial session with several professionals in order to find the best fit . " <p> A stronger relationship brings resilience to both partners individually and to the couple . When Brad feels emotionally connected with Becca , for example , he is " set free " in a sense to be a better employee , friend , and lover as well . He is a better person in and out of his marriage because of the increased positive sense of himself gained through his connection with Becca . <p> 7 . What do you focus on most when working with couples ? Some counselors may be surprised by this question , but that 's okayyou should know what to expect , and this question helps get you there . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other approaches emphasize new understanding and insights . You know , things like this is how you felt with your dad , or this is how you felt at home , etc. , but that 's not where you find yourself nowgaining that insight . <p> But a newer way of creating change is by focusing on and working with lively emotion . This helps couples make explicit that which is rarely , if ever , spoken between them . When Charles , for example , sees and feels how much his disapproval really hurts Sophia , her emotion is a powerful agent of change for him . He was n't aware that it hurt her so . These " underbelly " emotions are powerful if you know how to uncover and use them for a stronger bond . <p> 8 . What do you do if a couple is n't sure they should stay together ? Some therapists are more " marriage friendly . " Other therapists are more " divorce friendly . " William Doherty , a professor and marriage and family therapist , warns couples that couple therapy can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage in the same way that you do . He encourages couples to pay attention to the values a counselor has about couple therapy before beginning therapy . <p> Ask yourself , " Do I want a counselor who will help us fight for this marriage ? " If so , listen carefully to the therapists response to this question . The decision about your relationship is your own , but so is the decision to choose a therapist who will work with you for what you desire . If you tell the counselor you want to make the relationship work , and can they help you two do this , and the counselor is neutral about this , why pay for counseling with them ? ! Yes , they may do their best and later say they ca n't help you beyond a certain point . That 's fine . But up-front if they cant join with you in doing all they can to make it workgo elsewhere for goodness sake ! <p> 9 . When should couples stay together or break up ? Typically , a counselor will say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad response , because , ethically , therapists do n't  make decisions for their couples . But see if you can push the counselor to talk about when a couple should break up . <p> For example , if a relationship involves domestic violence , which is harmful to victims and children who are exposed to violence , divorce may be the best option . If a partner refuses to address destructive patterns of addiction or engages in repeated affairs that destroy trust , again , divorce may be best . On the other hand , though , beware of therapists who see divorce as a solution unto itself . More often the issues behind a breakup are more important than the decision to stay or go . <p> 10 . Of the couples you 've seen , what percentage would say you helped them improve their relationship ? This may seem like an obvious question , but few clients actually ask counselors about their success rates . <p> Granted , judging success in counseling is often difficult , and many factors can influence treatment outcomes . However , two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be looking for a percentage at least this high . <p> Once you decide to schedule an appointment , be aware that having one session with a couple counselor is n't a commitment to continue with that therapist . Its okay to let the therapist know that you plan to have an initial session with several professionals in order to find the best fit . This approach is standard ; plus , it just makes good sense . <p> Lastly , feel free to think about each session for several days after the fact .

Here 's what to do.BY SHARON M. RIVKIN , M.A. , M.F.T. <p> DepositPhoto Snarky comments might not seem that damaging because they can lack the emotion of yelling , but they can be tough on a relationship . <p> " Put-downs are a form of control and power , and carry the potential to do major damage to the marriage . " <p> Snarky comments you know , those snide or critical remarks that your spouse may say that hurt , put you on the defensive , and spoil your day ? Exerted by one over the other , put-downs are a form of control and power , and carry the potential to do major damage to the marriage . However , the sooner this condescending behavior is addressed , the better likelihood that harmony can be restored to the marriage . <p> It all starts with understanding why your partner does it , which takes some investigation . Then , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit to , the put-downs have the potential to be eradicated from the relationship ! <p> Why Does Your Spouse Put You Down ? <p> Let 's start by asking two important questions : Did you marry someone who has this disposition ? Or did it start later in marriage ? <p> 1 . If you married your spouse knowing he had this " quality , " it will be more difficult , though not impossible to change . Put-downs are almost always associated with control and power , and/or insecurity , and are used to one-up the recipient as a means to make the deliverer feel better and more important than the other . Those who exhibit this behavior on a consistent basis were most likely raised by parents who used invasive control . What does that mean ? Parents who tried to control your thoughts , who you are , or how you feel , all of which can be very damaging to the individual . This type of parental control makes you doubt your own perceptions and opinions because they were probably squashed by your parents and substituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you want to control , as a means of trying to gain control ! But this obviously backfires big-time . <p> 2 . If snarky remarks started later in the marriage , possibly communication has started to break down , which can eventually lead to resentment , insecurity , disrespect , and mistreatment . Factors contributing to this could be an affair , raising children , job-related issues , a health crisis , etc. ; any of which could disrupt the status quo of the relationship . If any of these factors are an issue in your relationship , even with a healthy childhood , anyone is capable of developing resentment , anger , and hurt , which leads to snarky comments . Why ? Because you want to hurt back . <p> For instance , if there was an affair , one spouse might put down the other as a form of punishment . Or , if your wife is having job issues , the added pressure might cause her to lash out at you for her inability to solve her own work problems . Or maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner reacts with mean comments intended to get a rise out of you . <p> Sometimes its as simple as wanting your spouse to stop confronting you with the desire to process everything ( which men think women do a lot ) , and you react by making a sarcastic remark just to get her to stop talkinga hurtful and indirect means of communication . <p> How Do You Stop The Put-Downs ? <p> The first thing is to acknowledge that neither of you like doing it to each other , and then make a game plan to stop . If one or both of you cant acknowledge that something needs to change , its time to elicit the help of a good therapist . <p> However , if both of you acknowledge the problem , here 's what you can do : <p> 1 . Good communication is the key to solving this issue . Most people do n't  understand what that means . Good communication is the safety to state your opinion , without judgments or interruption from your partner , and your ability to listen to your partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen and hear , the more likely that your spouse will take action from what you request in your conversation . When this happens , trust builds , respect enters , and the relationship gets closer . <p> 2 . If you are the one who typically delivers the snarky remarks , each time you feel like something mean is going to be expressed , immediately stop and replace that with talking about your feelings about what 's really going on . <p> " I get really irritated when I ask you to stop talking and you persist . I think you know how much that bothers me . " As the recipient , you need to listen to what was said , and rather than take it personally , respond with , " Okay , I hear you .

@@79604736 @1104736/ <p> A new calculator can help couples see their odds of success with in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) before they start treatment , a recent study suggests . <p> Doctors have traditionally been reluctant to estimate couples chances of having a baby before they complete at least one cycle of IVF , allowing clinicians to assess the quality of the eggs , sperm and embryos in addition to individual characteristics such as age , weight and medical conditions . <p> With the new pre-treatment calculator , however , women can get an estimate of their chances before that first cycle of IVF and it can be adjusted based on what doctors discover after that cycle is completed , said lead study author Dr. David McLernon of the University of Aberdeen in the U.K. <p> " I do n't  think women would want to undergo their first cycle of IVF just to determine their chances in future cyclesI think their aim would be to have a baby in that first attempt , " McLernon said by e-mail . <p> For the current study , researchers examined data on 113,873 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 percent of the women had a baby after one cycle and 43 percent delivered an infant after six complete cycles , researchers report in The BMJ . <p> Age was one pre-treatment indicator of the odds of success .

JONI FRATER AND ESTHER LASTIQUE <p> BigStockPhoto A sexless marriage does n't have to be so . There are professionals able to help . <p> " Men need sex to feel love , intimacy and connection . Women need to feel loved and connected to want to be sexual . " <p> I have been married for three years now . I love my wife and I try to be a good husband to her , however , since we got married ( beginning on the honeymoon ) she has had almost no desire to be sexual with me . It should be noted that we were not sexually active before marriage . We have had sex maybe 10-12 times in three years . She is uninterested in sex and any other sexual activities . When we do engage in other activities , its apparent that they are a chore for her . As you probably guessed , I initiate almost all sexual activity . When she does initiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something small to " satisfy me , " although she often does n't want to take the time to get me to climaxfor example , she will touch me over clothing for a minute and then end the encounter and go watch TV . She has admitted that she has little to no interest in sex . We had talked about sex before marriage and it seemed like we both had the same desires and goals for our intimate relationship . It has become increasingly hard for me to deal with this because for me , sex with my wife is very important . Its beginning to feel like we are just friends or roommates . I increasingly feel lonely , unsatisfied , unloved , and empty . We have talked about the issue several times , but we seem to be at a dead end . I know I ca n't keep feeling like this forever , its too painful . I do n't think I can live in a sexless marriage . What should I do ? <p> From the information we have , let 's assess the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife were non-sexual before marriage , you were unaware that you both have very different libido levels even though you talked about it . There may be many underlying reasons for her not wanting to be sexual and its very common for you to feel frustrated when you have unmet expectations . Let 's talk about a few suggestions to move you both forward . <p> 1 . Starting now , you must reclaim your sexual side for yourself and masturbate . Orgasm is a great stress reliever and you need the sexual release . It will also help you keep your emotions in check if the frustration level continues to intensify . Please remember that it is your responsibility to keep in touch with your own physical needs . Try using the shower , where you can be alone . <p> 2 . Start being more physical with her in non-sexual ways . Holding hands , kissing and gentle massage are wonderful ways to show affection without the pressure of sex . You need to break the touch barrier that is happening between you . <p> 3 . Say this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel that our relationship is missing something that is important to me . I need a more intimate relationship . " Then ask her for a date to have the most open and honest conversation about sex that you have ever had . If she says no , ask if she would prefer to do it with a professional present . We would recommend a marriage counselor or a sex therapist , which will be non-judgmental and unbiased about talking about healthy sexuality . If she still says no , tell her that being in a sexless marriage is not what you want and you are willing to work with her to make your life together better , and that you are asking her to be willing to do the same . <p> During your open and honest conversation , here are some questions that need to be answered : <p> * Why do n't  you want to be sexual with me ? <p> * Has she ever felt sexual , either alone or with a partner ? <p> * Is there something in her history that holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with you and/or a professional counselor ? <p> * Has she ever masturbated ? <p> * Has she ever had an orgasm ? How ? <p> Then you must ask yourself if you are dedicated and patient enough in order to help her discover her sexuality , possibly for the first time , and if you are willing to do whatever it takes to let her feel safe enough to feel sexual ? <p> Herein lies the biggest difference between men and women in regards to relationships and sexual satisfaction : Men need sex to feel love , intimacy and connection . Women need to feel loved and connected to want to be sexual . Remember that for women , our emotions and our mental state are directly tied to our arousal level . If she is depressed , afraid , overwhelmed or angry , she will not feel very sexy . <p> Tell her how being sexless makes you feeluse the words you used in your letter " lonely , unloved , unsatisfied and empty . " Your words are very clear about your desires . Explain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure she will enjoy a sexual relationship with you as much as you will . If she is inexperienced , some of her disinterest may be rooted in a fear of " doing it wrong " or disappointing you . Learning how to love and please each other together is marriages greatest gift . For new lovers , learning together is a great bonding experience . <p> If her level of sexual experience is the issue , offer to show her what feels good for you . Shared masturbation is an amazingly educational exercise . If she has never masturbated , sharing this with you may be too intimate an act for her . That said , if she is willing , ask her to show you what feels good to her . Bear in mind that in the past , if she was not physically aroused enough before intercourse she may not have been adequately lubricated , making penetration painful . Pain is not an experience many of us enjoy repeating so try to focus on her pleasure and orgasm first to help her embrace her sexuality and inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that you use a good lube for hand play and intercourse . <p> We understand that you feel that you are standing at a crossroads in your relationship . Living in a sexless relationship for long times is very stressful and unhealthy physically , mentally , and emotionally . You both have choices and a big decision to make . Are you both going to invest the time and energy to save your marriage by revitalizing your sex life no matter what it takes ? It sounds like you are willing to hold out your hand to her and take the first step . Its now up to her to put her hand in yours and be an active part of your relationship . <p> We believe that all couples can navigate the road back to each other and we hope to inspire hitched readers to raise the level of passion in their lives and relationships .

TRINA READ <p> Steve Cooper , hitched When it comes to orgasms , does it matter if you 're fiddling the bean in the boat or hitting the G-Spot ? <p> " Through his interviews , Kinsey found women could not and were not having vaginal orgasms as Freud preached . " <p> For a hundred years there has been an on going debate with sex researchers , feminists and pop-culture as to what is superiorthe vaginal or clitoral orgasm . Regrettably , this orgasm debate has left many women wondering whether the orgasm she is experiencing is the real or best one . <p> What 's The Difference ? First of all , what is the difference between a vaginal and clitoral orgasm ? The clitoral orgasm is achieved by direct stimulation of the clitoris . Orgasms are triggered by fingers , tongue , sex toys , or by masturbation and are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically described as " higher " and " intense " and can be accompanied by a sense of over stimulation . <p> A vaginal orgasm is achieved via stimulation of the vagina canal , which includes the G-Spot , the lower interior vaginal walls and the cervix . Vaginal orgasms are usually described as " deep " and " relaxing " , and can be followed by a profound sense of calm . Orgasms during intercourse are often less acute . <p> Vaginal Orgasm 's Rise In Popularity It was Sigmund Freud who first suggested that there were two types of orgasms . He theorized the orgasm experienced through clitoral stimulation was the precursor of a deeper , more satisfying orgasm experienced in the vagina during penetration by the penis . <p> According to Freud , the vaginal orgasm was a feminine and mature sexual response , while the clitoral orgasm was masculine , immature and inferior . In essence , a married woman , who loved her husband , was supposed to naturally " transfer " the pleasurable feelings she had from her clitoris to her vagina during penile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Freud did not have any scientific proof ; this whole idea was concocted by his powers of supposing . <p> Freud and his disciples took the vaginal orgasm idea and wrote many papers on the topic thereby making it " scientifically " sound . As such , the hard-to-win-over scientific and medical communities embraced the superior vaginal orgasm . <p> For more than half a century , women tried unsuccessfully to be good lovers by transferring their inferior clitoral orgasm to the mature vagina . Not surprisingly , many women ended up in therapy with Freud and his disciples to help them deal with this " sexual dysfunction . " <p> The Fight Against Freud In the 1940s , sex researcher Dr. Alfred Kinsey took thousands of men and womens sex histories . Through his interviews , Kinsey found women could not and were not having vaginal orgasms as Freud preached . Kinsey lashed out on Freuds ideas . Unfortunately , his book was written for academics and did not appeal to the average reader . <p> Then in the 1960s , sex researchers Masters and Johnson decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed womens sexual response to different stimulation and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasm , while a small minority achieved vaginal orgasm . <p> Masters and Johnsons findings coincided with the feminist movement . Feminists were infuriated that Freud , one man , could have messed up womens minds , orgasms and sex lives for so many generations . Feminists went on a campaign to gain back the respect for clitoral orgasm . <p> The fight was not an easy one . For example , Dr. Mary Jane Sherfey , Freudian trained psychiatrist published The Nature and Evolution of Female Sexuality in 1966 . Bravely her book questioned then disproved Freuds orgasm theory . The hostility from the scientific community was immense . <p> Thank goodness today most women do feel comfortable having a clitoral orgasm . However , there is still a lot of confusion and misunderstanding surrounding whether women are missing out on the bigger vaginal orgasm experience . <p> Today 's Debate Where do some of these misunderstandings come from ? Part of it is triggered by pop-cultures latest craze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As well , romance novels and movies often depict woman being completely orgasmic with no foreplay and only penile penetration . <p> I have spoken to many women who wonder what is wrong with them that they can not have a G-Spot orgasm or can not get turned-on by simple penile thrusting . I always reassure them the majority of women are only able to orgasm via stimulation of the clitoris . <p> Which Is Better : Vaginal Or Clitoral ? The question remains , is there a best kind of orgasm ? The answer would have to be absolutely not . An orgasm is an orgasm is an orgasm , regardless of how it manifests itself . The bottom line is , it does not matter how a woman climaxes so long as she enjoys herself in the process . 113806 @qwx733806

Once we realize that a boring sex life is not a broken sex life , that 's when we can start working toward improving intimacy in our relationships . <p> The following are five ways to keep that passionate spark alive now and throughout your marriage : <p> 1 .

That way , when the time comes to discuss what may need to change to keep sex gratifying , you will be incredibly comfortable with each other and be able to discuss it without shame or embarrassment . The other benefit is that by talking about your sex life in a non-sexual situation , you remove the possibility of either of you taking anything personallythe last thing you want to do is bruise your spouses ego by telling them you 're not having as good a time in bed as they think you are ! In this unloaded setting , you can talk about technique and what you each need physically to make sure your sex life is as exciting as it can possibly be . <p> Step 2 : Commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved out 10 minutes a day just for you as a couple . Hooray ! Now its time to expand that . There are some great ways to transform your relationship by spending more time together that will also transform you mind , home , body or bank account . Here are a few ideas : <p> 1 . Take a class together . Many local high schools and colleges , religious organizations and community centers have continuing education classes that are inexpensive or free . Learn a language , a computer program , explore history or film , anything that interests you both on and gives you an opportunity to grow together . <p> 2 . Develop a workout routine together . If you both like the gym , go together and work out together . If not , how about a yoga class or a walking routine or biking ? Find something physical to do togetheryou will be healthier , live longer , and you can even take the kids if you have to ! Furthermore , you will provide the example of a healthy happy and romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a regular date night . Whether its once a month or once a week , spend an evening together that is all about you as a couple . Get dressed up ( if that 's your thing ) and celebrate your love for each other . If money is tight , pack a picnic and walk along the beach at sunset or visit a park . Romance can be freeits all about the love you feel not the amount you spend . And regular date nights are another great example for your kidsit teaches them boundaries and respect for your romantic relationship . <p> 4 . Turn mundane chores into opportunities to spend time together . Do you need to clean out the garage , scrub the pool or turn over the garden ? Do it as a couple or family project and make it fun ! You can even turn your chores into an opportunity to role play and find that afternoon delight ! ( Does the lawn boy have time for a cool drink inside ? Follow me Big Boy ) <p> 5 . Take up a hobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build bird houses or start an organic garden , learn a new cuisine or rebuild a classic car ? Pick a dream hobby and do it together . There are also a multitude of businesses you can start from home , especially in the internet age . Start a blog , create a website or write a book and watch your relationship and your savings account grow together . <p> Step 3 : Commit to Revitalizing Your Sex Life Romance and spending time together are vital to a relationship . So is sex . We are the only creatures on the planet capable of sheer pleasure from sex with no other agenda , so take advantage of it ! The beautiful thing about sex in a marriage is that you know so much more now than you did when you first got together . You know what turns each other on and you know how your bodies work . The exciting news is that because our bodies are constantly changing , and for women our hormones fluctuate on a daily basis , sex can still be all about discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your partner and discovering how to maximize that pleasure as long as we live . <p> Medical studies are proving that regular orgasmic sex has a multitude of health benefits ( see : " How Lots of Sex Can Help You Live Longer " ) , and the more often you climax , the healthier you can be . Regular orgasm can prevent cardiovascular disease , prostate cancer , breast cancer , and bladder problems while improving brain function , bone density , your moods and your blood sugar . The brain chemistry changes alone can transform your life , and the hormone bursts that orgasm provide last up to 24 hours . We recommend an orgasm for each partner every 24 hours to maximize these health benefits . <p> So you see , transforming our relationships takes as little as 10 minutes a day . Make passion and romance a priority in your life and in your marriage , and every facet of your life will improveyour health , your job and all of your relationships . Do n't  take our word for it , try it out for yourselves . 
@@79604743 @1104743/ <p> Unbalanced RelationshipSome feel they put more of themselves into the relationship than the other . How do they bring back balance ? BY DR . SCOTT HALTZMAN <p> BigStockPhoto Do you feel like you 're doing more in your relationship than your spouse ? <p> Why do I feel I 'm doing more for the relationship than my partner is ? <p> The holidays are over , and you 're looking at the mounds of wrapping paper surrounding your mate , then you examine your own paltry ashtray full of tissue paper . " That 's not fair ! " you tell yourself , " I 'm tired of being the only one to give in this relationship , when do I get ? " <p> This scenario does n't  just happen over the holidays . If you 're sensing there 's an imbalance between what you give and what you get in the marriage , then its probably a feeling that is with you all year long . Its easy for me to explain away this problem by simply saying , " This is because you are so much more loving and thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant and uncaring than you . " <p> Maybe that is the case . But before you jump to conclusions , consider the possibility that your partner sees him or herself as giving plenty to the relationship . He or she may also believe there 's an imbalance , but concludes its because you 're not pulling your weight ! <p> Let 's look first at scorekeeping . Early in your relationship you did n't  consciously keep track of who was giving what . Back then , you were so excited that that attractive soul was interested in you that just being together counted for more than any individual act on his or her part . Also , during courting , you tended to give your mate the benefit of the doubt , and every effort to make you happy was appreciated . If he gave you yellow roses ( even though you love white ) you were happy ; if she bought you tickets to a Guns N Roses concert even though you preferred Jimmy Buffet , you were thrilled . <p> During the introductory period , you looked at wrongly-chosen gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not as an automatic judgment of how well they knew you . By the time your official courting days ended and you decided to tie the knot , your unconscious scorekeeper lead you to the impression that you were getting a lotand you planned on having it stay that way until " death do us part . " <p> As the relationship proceeds , the scorekeeping becomes more conscious and often appears to be more out of balance . One reason your partner seems to come up short is because once people tie the knot , they do focus less on doing things specifically to please their mate . Its normal , of course , for some courting behaviors to dip once the wedding bells toll , but thoughtfulness shouldnt disappear off the face of the earth ! In fact , in most marriages the giving does n't  stop . So if there 's a fair amount of generosity on both sides , why does it seem like the giving well has dried up ? <p> Bad Assumptions The reason is because of assumptions about who your partner is and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things you value , you wonder why your partner does n't  appreciate it and does n't  reciprocate . That may be because you 're giving what you would like to have and not what your partner wants or needs . After settling down , if he continues to give her yellow roses on a daily basis , she begins to feel neglected because he should know she likes the white ones ; if she arranges for him to go on the road and follow a Guns N Roses tour , he feels irritated because its not meaningful to him . <p> Each partner makes a gesture , saying to themselves : " I give and give " and receives by reflecting : " I 'm not getting what I want . " As couples proceed day in and day out , they start to tally up what is owed to them and see that their partners are coming up woefully short . <p> The imbalances occur over many more issues than simply roses or rock bands . One partner may spend hours cleaning up the house spotlessly ( as a gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . Another partner may stay at work and earn extra money for the family ( as a gesture of love ) and may arrive to a mate who 's annoyed that dinner was delayed . Not only does n't  the extra income " count " as giving to the relationship , its actually seen as detracting from the marriage . <p> Solving the Imbalance The problems can be solved , though , with a few steps to get the scales adjusted . <p> 1 . Focus less on keeping score , and more on maintaining the relationship as a partnership . Remember , you 're both on the same team , and the goal is to keep it moving in the right direction . <p> 2 . Be open to the things that your partner is giving you as gifts that you may not have appreciated before . Your mate may be making a contribution in ways you may not notice , such as suggesting a better tie to go with that shirt , fixing something around the house , making doctors appointments for you or just sitting by your side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your partner wants from you to show love . ( Hint : it may be the things he or she does for you . ) If you can learn what your mate values , then you have a better chance of knowing what to give . Once you figure it out , do n't  hold back , even though its something that you would n't value yourself . <p> 4 . Do n't  expect your better half to be able to read your mind . If you want certain thingslike red roses rather than whitelet him or her know . Be ready to experience some slip-ups along the way , as old habits are hard to break . But do n't  be frustrated , and continue to be clear about the things that you value ; eventually you 'll start getting more of it . <p> 5 . When you make a mental list of needs and wants , include the following : " to see my mate happy .

@@79604744 @1104744/ <p> If You Cheated , Should You Tell ? Should you tell if you cheat ? Is honesty better or worse once you have cheated ? What are the long term effects either way ? Dr. Trina Read has researched some answers.BY DR . TRINA READ <p> John Dalog There are a lot of factors to weigh before you decide if you 're going to come clean or tell your spouse about your infidelity . <p> " Immediately get yourself tested for sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) and put all sexual contact with your spouse on hold . " <p> Youve done the deed and cheated on your spouse . Now in the aftermath you are n't  sure what to do . Some people feel telling a spouse about an affair is an absolute must . Others feel that under certain circumstances it is best to put the episode behind you and try to heal the marriage . Who is right ? Or is there a right answer ? <p> My Experience <p> This question all started when my husband I and were listening an interviewee talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both of us have had ex-partners whove cheated on us and my husband first said , " Its just better not to tell . " I was like , " WTF ? Of course you have to tell . Youve done the deed and you need to come clean . " Mini-fight ensued ( actually it was a toe-to-toe fight ) about the reasons why , or why not , someone should confess if they have cheated . Both of us felt passionate and had solid reasoning which created a debate stalemate . <p> I wanted to understand why there could be such an emotional and intellectual difference of opinion so I began my research . Plus , I felt a little shaken that if my husband did cheat he felt it better not to tell me . <p> Cheating studies and research is all over the map . Some researchers say there 's a 5050 chance today that one partner will have an affair during a marriage , including non-physical relationships . Other experts believe this increase in cheating is due to greater opportunity ( time spent away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' habit before getting married . <p> Digging deeper into the topic , I found that whether you should tell a spouse about an affair is a highly complex and personal matter . The field of ethics can be divided largely into two camps : the good and the right . If you are in the " good " camp you may feel it best to not mention your indiscretion if you feel that your relationship would be better off that way . In fact , 27% of people who reported being happy in marriage admitted to having an affair . <p> Meanwhile , the " right " camp believes right is right , wrong is wrong , and therefore you must tell your spouse about what you did . <p> Before confessing the deed to your spouse , however , there 's also the the larger social circle to consider , including your kids , extended families , and shared friendsamongst others . It 's important to consider how a potential breakup would effect everyone else and your relationship with them ? <p> Other considerations include asking the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a moment of weakness , a one-night-stand that will never happen again . Or you were feeling unhappy in your marriage and went looking for attention elsewhere . Was it a lack of respect or caring for your spouse ? Or perhaps you 've fallen out love and cheating was an easy way to get out of the marriage . This understanding is vitally important if you plan on working to repair what 's brokenthis might require professional help . <p> Once cheating has taken place , unfortunately , there 's even more problems to consider . Cheating has put you at risk for social diseases such as venereal disease or AIDS . Immediately get yourself tested for sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) and put all sexual contact with your spouse on hold . <p> Reactions to the Cheating <p> Most people react blindly when they find out their partner has had an affair , which may lead to actions of revenge that they later regret . Usually the first thing to happen upon confession is the cheater is told to leave . This is not necessarily a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually decide to do this , but for now there 's a lot they need to know about the situation before they can make an intelligent decision about what to do . For starters , as long as you are in the same house , you have a chance to work things out . <p> If you decide to reconcile , everyone who has been told about the affair could make things difficult by harboring anger and hostility for what transpired . They may also show resentment toward partner taking them back . <p> Another unintentional consequence once a spouse has been told about an affair is they may become inquisitive . Its natural for people to be curious about the other person . Repeatedly questioning , referring to them , or dragging their name into a conversation will put the spotlight on that person instead of on the real issues of the infidelity . Your spouse might even call or confront the other person . <p> What Are the Long Term Effects If You Tell ? <p> Trust is the foundation to any solid relationship . The emotional fallout from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It produces anger at the spouse for cheating , anger at the other person involved , anger at oneself for not finding out earlier or for being so trusting . Your spouse may feel they have lost the person they invested so much time , effort , love and intimacy . Feelings of depression and other health issues may surface . <p> Your spouse may no longer trust you and you may live with feelings of guilt until the situation is finally resolved ; or perhaps you have them for the rest of your life . The stress may make you perform poorly on the job and make you susceptible to poor health . Finally , there is a real possibility you lose your family , possessions and must start your life all over again . <p> The harmful effects of how cheating affect the children are well documented . Children are often required to be loyal to one parent and not to the other . Sometimes children are fed a lot of negative information about their mother or father and children are understandably confused ; and their self-esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associate with you . <p> Family members on each side may align themselves with one or the other spouse , thus fueling disagreements between the two families . Family and friends may also influence initiating a separation or a divorce . <p> If you decide not to tell you will have to live with the guilt that one day your husband or wife might discover the truth . As mentioned above , this guilt may affect your health and your interactions with the people around you . The decision to tell is a personal one that again boils down to being either " good " or " right . " While that 's a personal decision , the simplest solution is to not cheat and avoid the conundrum. 113806 @qwx733806

" <p> How do you know if your spouse is acting out or has a more serious condition ? Major personality shifts are n't something most are prepared for . What makes things tough is that we think we have our soul mate , a person we know and trust with whom we can spend our lives and not have to worry . We love the predictable nature and the security of a spouse we can count onpossibly the only person we can count on . We think we know who they are and are confident in our knowledge and assume that they would never do anything to hurt us . <p> There may , however , be warning signs .

Sometimes it is that simple , very painful , but not unusual in our world . As a marriage counselor with training in addictions , compulsive behaviors and mental health issues , I have learned that there are more serious problems that sometimes arise but are unrecognized until they undermine what once was a secure marriage .

This can include use of drugs or alcohol to self-medicate and regulate mood , usually unsuccessfully . Bi-polar disorder often runs in families . <p> Addiction rarely appears in only one form .

You may have read about Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban when his relapse resulted in admission to a treatment center after only four months of marriage . <p> Personality disorders are more subtle and may be more complicated . Symptoms such as rage may be triggered on a regular basis by certain situations or people . Individuals may become extremely critical of their partner , verbally abusive and unreasonable and then apologize profusely promising never to do it again .

What I hope is that you 'll read this and change some of your behaviors and approaches so that your relationships can be more sexually ( and emotionally ) fulfilling . <p> What You Can Expect <p> This book is divided into two simple sections : " Out of the Bedroom " and " In the Bedroom .

This section is designed to improve your approach and pleasure quotient in the bedroom , or wherever else you like to be intimate . <p> So let me be clear . There 's no guarantee that you 're getting laid this evening . If you really want to have great sex with your wife , prep for tomorrow , not tonight . If you think she 'll just hop into the sack after a long day juggling responsibilities at the office , or at home with the kids , or BOTH , you 'll most likely be met with an eye roll . It 's probably too late for tonight . <p> So do n't focus on the sex you wish you could have tonight . Focus on the sex you can have tomorrow night . And try to understand that female desire is n't like male desire . Maybe watching us bend over to load the dishwasher is all you need to get all hot and bothered , but we need more . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the dishwasher . ) It 's all of that " outside the bedroom " stuff that makes us want to get it on inside the bedroom . If we turn you down tonight , do n't let it piss you off . It 's not that we want to turn you down . We just need a little more prep time . So come to bed and snuggle with us . Hop in , give us a kiss , and focus on the great sex we 're going to have tomorrow night .

I recently experienced the " rush " of hosting my very own and after a few tag sale bumps and bruises , I got the hang of it and enjoyed the experience . Although my husband was less than thrilled with the prospect of selling junk on our driveway , he reluctantly agreed to help . I also got my father and mother involved and we had a family-friendly fall sale . Along the way , I learned some valuable tag sale etiquette tips that I would like to share with anyone considering or willing to give it another go . <p> 1 . A plastic cookie container left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An alternative is a zippered pouch worn fashionably around the waist or a sturdy cigar box with the words Tag Sale Change written across the top . My father had the pouch and the cigar box . I had the cookie container with a few leftover crumbs still included . <p> 2 . Label all items in advance of the big event . My husband encouraged me to take some time and do this the night before , but I confidently informed him that I was testing the label-free approach . It failed miserably . I foolishly thought I could just price as I go . When someone asked me for my " price , " I would tell him or her and we would negotiate . So it went like this , " How much for this ? " I replied with pride , " $10 , " and they would counter with , " I 'll give you 70 cents . " We would both look at each other and both ask the same question under our breath , " Are you nuts ?

Setting up a small table announcing " Free " coffee , cider and sweets is a good ploy to lure them away from the competitors . I did n't  do it this time , but I will employ the tactic at my next sale . <p> 5 . Make pleasant conversation with your customers . A friend of ours , who brought over muffins and coffee , noticed that my marketing strategy was somewhat inferior to my fathers . My father , I am told , was up front spinning tales and telling stories about each item he was trying to peddle . There was laughter , there were tears and there was singing and reminiscing . Of course , his strategy was superior . By the time they got to me , they were laden with all of his junkthey were also penniless . Just as well , I was too busy looking for my misplaced Glad Ware container that held all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold it ) and chasing down random plastic bags for Dad 's customers to carry off their future garage sale items . <p> 6 . Have a good supply of paper bags available for your customers to carry away their items . It would also be a good idea to have available a few strong teenagers to assist the customers with their heavier purchases . <p> 7 . Do n't  sell anything sentimental ( in front of the person that gave it to you or in front of the person that it belongs to ) . My husband ran across several special mementoes that he had given me throughout the years and my daughter walked out just in time to find her high chair being carted off by a stranger . She eventually forgave me , but my husband is still a little upset . <p> 8 . No returns . Cash and carry only . <p> 9 . No layaways . Yes , I was asked and almost considered it . <p> 10 . Have an electric outlet available for people to check out the iron , coffee pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was surprised at the number of people who asked to try out the blow dryer and electric skillet before purchasing . <p> 11 . Tear down your tag sale signs promptly . Your neighbors will thank you and so will city hall . <p> 12 . Do n't  abuse the tag sale opportunity . Once in a blue moon is fine , but there are many who make it a weekend habit of having a garage sale . It is not good for neighborhood morale to have your repeat customers trampling over your neighbors fall garden on a weekly basis . <p> At the end of the day , it is always fun to get rid of clutter , meet new neighbors and laugh at some of the unexpected tag sale experiences you will be talking about for years to come . 113805 @qwx733805

Our sex expert explains the three important elements to a great kiss : the breath , the lips and the tongue.BY WENDY STRGAR <p> BigStockPhoto A kiss is an extremely powerful communication tool that should be understood . <p> " One secret that transforms every kiss is the power of intention that every kiss holds . " <p> " A kiss can be a comma , a question mark or an exclamation point . That 's basic spelling that every woman ought to know . " -Jeanne Bourgeois <p> If ever there was a communication mechanism that predicted the destiny and longevity of a romantic interlude , and the sign of a great marriage , its the kiss . What we say with our kisses , as well as how they 're received and understood is the basis for all the sexual conversations they initiate . <p> The dynamics of a great kiss are multi-layered and complex ; the moment the lips meet a cascade of neural messages and chemicals are released in the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even euphoria . Indeed , when we kiss deeply , our hearts beat faster and our breathing becomes deep and irregular , mimicking the response of intense exercise . <p> One secret that transforms every kiss is the power of intention that every kiss holds . Kisses that are insincere or are demanding intimacy that does n't  exist are visible for what they are . Whether its that first kiss to your spouse in the morning or the 5,000th kiss goodbye , your shared kiss reveals what the two of you are feeling . You can not hide ambivalence inside of a kiss . There is no forcing in a kiss , although most of us can remember the unwelcome thrust of an un-invited tongue shoving its way in . The use of unnecessary force or the urge to pull away speaks volumes . <p> Approaching the art of kissing with the same goals we bring to cultivating meaningful conversation clarifies both technique and intent . In fact , if you think of kissing as a way of communicating in ways words cant , the subtlety of good kissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoveries in the art of kissing is that it should not be rushed . Just as a real conversation opens with the capacity to listen , the patient kisser is curious and their kisses demonstrate their sensitivity and understanding . Rushing in and trying to take control of the kiss screams amateur and will push your spouse away more often than pulling them in . <p> Applying Proper Technique <p> There are three primary elements that turn on a kissing conversation : breath , lips and tongue . <p> Breath : Employing the breath as a space holder and using it to connect to your partner conveys the deep connection that it cultivates . Breathing through your nose and allowing deeper breaths to align you with your spouse is one way to get the connection deeply . Many tantric techniques rely only on synchronized breathing to create a mystical and profound unity . This slow attentive kissing can open the doorway to deep passion that may just leave you gasping for air . <p> The Lips : Our lips have the ability to give kissing an enormous vocabulary . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the ability to communicate soft opening , as well as firm control . Experiment with softening your lips even for a short kiss and see how that changes the dialogue . Hard kisses with tight lips can be overwhelming even in the midst of serious passion . Soft open-mouth kisses invite your spouse into a dialogue , which is the goal . Feel for response . Open-mouthed kissing can teach you a lot about opening to relationshipsabout how to avoid forcing things , as well as giving both of you the opportunity to be active participants choosing their unspoken words . <p> The Tongue : The agile tongue can speak volumes in a kiss . Unfortunately , many people misunderstand the French kiss as a simple insertion of their tongue in the mouth of their partner .

The Impact On The ChildrenEven when you promise to keep your kids " out of it , " they 'll still feel the repercussions of divorce.BY LYNNE Z. GOLD-BIKIN <p> BigStockPhoto While breaking up with your husband or wife can hurt , the destruction toward your children can be devastating . <p> Before you decide to divorce , consider the impact on your children . I am not saying that you should stay together for the children , but simply suggesting that before you decide not to work on your marriage , you ought to think what you are doing to the children to whom you made commitments when you decided to have them . <p> You must recognize the fact that children are collateral damage in every divorce . Once there is a divorce , no matter how well you get along with your ex-spouse , the children have lost the security of the family . They are no longer living as their friends do , living with a mommy and a daddy . Theyre different . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ex once you are in separate households , but that is generally not the case . While it is usually true that divorce does not hurt children , parents do , parents going into a divorce proceeding almost can not help themselves from somehow using the children as weapons or pawns . <p> Divorce significantly affects children in other ways as well . Where , pre-divorce , the familys income supports one household , the same income must support two separate households post-divorce . Obviously , the childrens lifestyle will have to be reduced . And , divorce often forces a family to sell their house , the only home the children have ever lived in , so they lose their home , their neighborhoods and their security . This uprooting from their old neighborhood has to have an impact on them . <p> After a custody agreement is worked out , if that is possible , the children then have the stress of pleasing both sides , ( " I missed you , Daddy , when I was at Mommys " ) , being involved in message carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and being downloaded like a piece of software every time they return to the other parents home ( " So , was Daddys girlfriend over there ? " ) . <p> It is obvious to the children that they will be accidentally leaving clothes at each parents house and forgetting their favorite toys or even , as they get older , their computers . Going back and forth between their parents homes with little suitcases is not exactly a pleasant experience for anyone . <p> Unfortunately , in most divorces , there is some misbehavior on the part of the parents . That misbehavior may be as simple as asking the children to tell your ex that you will be late for an appointment or that you will not able to pick them up the following week , but it may extend to trying to enlist the children on your side in a continuing battle with your former spouse . <p> The worst , of course , is the custody litigation . Often , children are hostages as parents fight over who will get the marital residence and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ultimately mean custody litigation , an evaluation in which the children will be required to meet with not only a psychologist , but also ultimately a judge . Parents will often try to manipulate their children into saying certain things to each of these adults in the hopes of " winning " in the litigation . Oftentimes , the children will be asked which parent they prefer , which is a dreadful situation to put your children in ; they only have two parents and they are entitled to love both . <p> The last and most difficult thing in the divorce case is when one of the parents has found a new partner and the children are now introduced to that person as a new parent figure . No matter how you feel about your ex , your children are entitled to love the other parent as their parent . Attempting to substitute someone else as that parent figure is not only bad for the children , but will ultimately have a severe impact on them as they grow up . <p> Where there is abuse , cheating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and divorce may be inevitable . Where the parties have just grown apart , however , your decisions about separation and divorce should always take into consideration how your children will fare in two homes or how possibly losing the parent who moves away as a result of the divorce will impact them . Your children should be the first consideration , and you should think of them before you think about getting a divorce . Improving your communication skills with your spouse and working on your marriage is often a better option .

You are sick of reading about couples who are romantically in love after 20 , 30 , 40 or 50 years of wedlock . Even though their brain scans prove they are not lying ( according to the research conducted by Dr. Arthur Aron ) , it just seems unbelievable from where you sit by your hearth . You cant pinpoint exactly when things changed in your romantic heart , but you realize now that the quirks you once adored have become irritating . <p> Some of you might feel that your guy does not pull his weight around the house either .

Use your head . You might be perpetuating your own unhappiness . Your symptoms of distress might make him feel anxious . Maybe you dislike yourself , your career or who you have become . He might think you are questioning your life with him , instead of questioning your own goals . If he cant feel safe at home , where can he feel safe ? Find your power and use it in your relationship as opposed to using force . Force is the opposite of harmony . <p> 2 . Reduce stress .

Do n't  let stress accumulate and alter what you perceive . <p> 3 . Become the love you wish to attract . Men tune out nagging voices . The dictator-doormat style of dialogue does n't  work because you get preachy and give orders . Stimulate , rather than annihilate ! Focus on his strengths and build . Remember when you first fell in love , it was unconditional and filled with good energy ; when you have his attention , do n't  waste it on judgment . <p> 4 .

" <p> Merging two families and finances inevitably brings challenges . A common concern among blended families is how to divide assets so that all children are included fairly after the death of one or both spouses . How do you maintain fairness , be impartial and get along with your spouse all at the same time ? <p> One option is to set up a revocable living trust .

If the home belongs to the husband and he passes first , are his kids going to kick the wife out ? Having a trust protects the surviving spouse with a life estate in the home . Some states ( 10 to be exact ) will allow a husband or wife to leave a life estate without a trust . This is created by using transfer-of-death methods with the real estate and the county clerk 's office . This is a simple and inexpensive way to protect a spouses interest in a shared home . <p> What about IRAs ? Consider an example of someone who has toyed with getting married to his long-time girlfriend . His dilemma ? He wants his large IRAs to go to his daughters , not his spouse . He is n't trying to cut the spouse out altogether , he wants to " gift with strings . " He wants his spouse to get the income , but the children to get the principal when she dies . Of course , from a tax standpoint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spouse instead of the children because of the free spousal rollover available in the current tax code . Therefore , its suggested that he let the IRAs " roll over " tax free to his new wife and that he use a restricted beneficiary form to " gift with strings " by having only the income go to her . Restricted beneficiary forms are available using annuities , a fixed sum of money paid to someone each year , and most insurance companies offer them . The insurance company pays the wife the income and uses the annuity to guard the principal until she dies , when it can then be passed to his children . Annuities are the best way to ensure the principal stays intact . Annuities also offer the restricted forms and most companies provide this at no charge to the owner or beneficiary . <p> In this persons case the husband is also pursuing Roth IRA conversions at a partial rate .

Why does " the most wonderful time of the year " end up causing massive amounts of stress and overspending ? <p> Here , I share seven questions to ask yourself about your holiday spending habits pondering these things is far less expensive than therapy , and the answers can prompt you to make real , money-saving changes in your spending behaviors . <p> 1 . Do I believe the amount I spend on gifts reflects on me as a person ?

However , the notion that there are " right " and " wrong " price points for certain people in our lives really does n't  help us build quality relationships and can dig us into deep financial holes . True friends would probably rather you stay within your budget and might even appreciate a mutual agreement not to break the bank on a gift exchange ! <p> Money ca n't buy us love and neither can expensive gifts ; and if the amount you 're spending is important to the recipient , you might need new friends . <p> 2 . Do I feel " entitled " to a little excess this time of year ?

Its supposed to be a season of celebration ! you think . My family deserves to splurge and indulge a little bit . Well get back on the bandwagon when January rolls around . <p> The irony is that were racking up bills well have to work even harder to pay off once the tree comes down . You may be living your whole life like this : spending , spending , spending on a big house , a new car , all the latest electronics because your hard work means that you " deserve " it . Then you have to work even harder to sustain the lifestyle that you 're not really enjoying at all . Its a vicious cycle that many people never break because they never realize that the source of their unhappiness is , in fact , all of the " stuff " they thought would bring them joy . <p> 3 . Am I living my values when I overspend ? How often have you filled your shopping cart with piles of gifts just because its what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ads and " irresistible " sales ? How often have you purchased expensive ornaments and decorations so your home will look perfect ?

Do some soul searching this December and ask yourself what really brings you joy before you get out the credit cards . <p> In our supersized culture , " more " is too often equated with " happiness .

Instead it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest , greatest , most expensive gadgets for your kids may lead to unhappiness when you realize you are sending the wrong message and are not teaching your kids to live within their means . <p> 4 . Am I a victim of the instant gratification " epidemic ? " In a world of fast food , two-day shipping , video streaming , and 24-hour online shopping , most of us are n't  used to waiting . Our desire to get what we want now ( whether its a gift for someone else or ourselves ! ) can blind us to long-term consequences like the credit card bills that will arrive in January . <p> If you do n't  have the money in hand to pay for the holiday indulgences you want , accept that theyll have to wait awhile and start savingdont buy into the , " I 'll pay for it later " rationalization . Remind yourself that 90 percent of the stuff you and your family just " had to have " in the past is now collecting dust on a shelf . <p> The instant gratification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of paymentare so easy to use .

" <p> 5 . Is holiday overspending an unofficial family tradition ? In many families , the phrase , " But that 's how we always celebrate ! " excuses all manner of financial transgressions .

Over the years , overspending can become as much of a tradition as decorating a tree or lighting a menorah .

Maybe you could put together a menu from Grandmas childhood and prepare it together , while listening to her memories of celebrating the holidays as a young girl . The most meaningful traditions are n't  based on expendituresthey are based on rich experiences with friends and family . <p> Think about it this way : If your family has a blowout holiday celebration but then your kids hear you worrying about money for the next six months , which experience do you think will impact them more deeply ? <p> 6 . Have I considered the joy that financial self-control can bring ? We all know that gifts , parties , decorations , and entertainment are supposed to bring holiday joyand frugality does n't  sound very festive ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while spending without limits feels bad . The initial rush you may get from an extravagant holiday quickly wears offand it does not equate to more fun , greater happiness , or better memories .

However , psychology research tells us that we control roughly 40% of our happiness .

We seek someone we can have faith in and count on through thick and thin . Of course , even when ones mate seems like sheer perfection , no human is ever truly flawless . Even the best people and the most caring relationships have their faults and hiccups . When one partner betrays the other , the seeds of deep distrust have been sown . As the old adage goes , " It takes much time and energy to build trust , yet it only takes a few seconds to destroy it . " Once the damage of betrayal has been done , the only way to repair the situation is to face it openly and courageously . <p> After learning of a betrayal , fear and anger often set in quickly .

" " You never pay attention to me ! " " If only you would have more sex with me , I would n't have had to look elsewhere . " <p> The one who has been betrayed may accept the justifications and assume that the fault rests with some personal failure or defect .

Most people shy away from digging deeper into the emotions that arise , to do so can be incredibly uncomfortable and painful . First and foremost , the person who has been betrayed must accept that they did not cause the betrayal . If you have been betrayed , it is not your fault ; it is not your responsibility .

Some move through various emotional states and stages with ease , while others take months and even years to process the betrayal . In general , healing occurs more readily when an individual is willing to face emotions and thoughts in an open , nonjudgmental manner . During this stage , talking with a confidant or close friend can be very beneficial . It is important to engage in good self-care that includes proper nutrition and relaxation . Exercise and contact with nature can be extremely helpful in allowing emotions to surface and be released .

It is at this point that partners can begin to explore the unresolved patterns and issues that may have contributed to marital difficulties . <p> Again , accepting blame for the betrayers actions is counter-productive . Both the betrayer and the betrayed can utilize this next stage to understand the unhealthy issues that exist in the relationship . Self-honesty is critical to moving through this next stage .

The problem is many times they may face several challenges along the way primarily because they do n't  understand some key points when it comes to their credit scores . <p> I have a few tips Millennials should consider reviewing with their financial advisor or CPA in the near future . <p> 1 . Here is a case study I had with a millennial and our discussion about his retirement savings plan and his current student loans . Millennials ( born between 1982-2000 , roughly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing and saving for retirement . After running the numbers , as long as your interest rate is below 7.5% you are better off making your minimum payment while preparing a saving strategy at the same time . <p> Why 7.5% ? Because over the long run you will be able to outperform and earn more of a return on your investment , especially if you begin saving in your 20s and/or early 30s . <p> 2 . Millennials are less knowledgeable about credit scores simply because they have had less experience in the financial services marketplace . This is already putting them at a significant disadvantage . How can someone except to practice successful habits if they do n't  have the knowledge of how to do it due to inexperience . <p> 3 . Most Millennials do n't  know who 's in charge of compiling their credit report ? Nope , it 's not that company FICO , bank , or even a specific government agency ( we hope ) . Instead , the three major credit bureaus : Experian , Equifax and TransUnion are responsible for pulling together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the cycle works : <p> Banks and financial institutions send these bureaus data about their current customers . Any type of credit contract you have related to debt will be reported , including account information on student loans , credit cards , mortgage loans , car loans and other lines of credit . Debt collectors report to the credit bureaus , too . So , yes , that unpaid college health center bill could pop up on your report and hurt your credit score . <p> 4 . Its all in the score ! The FICO score that is : this is the score where lenders determine whether you can get approved for a loan and at what interest rate you will be paying . The higher the score the lower the interest rate . We want a score over 660 ( anything lower is considered subprime ) . Like it or not your FICO credit score will follow you everywhere so be smart and understand the FICO score is one reason credit scores can make or break your budget . <p> 5 . Many Millennials should know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ask for a credit report when determining whether they want to do business with you .

Millennials should know that some personal information , including your current and previous addresses , telephone numbers and date of birth , may appear on your credit report , but it wo n't influence your actual score . <p> 8 .

If you have a backyard , lanai or deck , make the most of your private outdoor setting on a pleasant night . Consider continuing your date night into the early morning hours to watch the sunrise . If you are feeling adventurous , bring sleeping bags and set up a tent and pretend you 're camping .

I love prosciutto-wrapped asparagus and cold shrimp cocktail with a sauce . You can also drop by your local grocer and pick up a loaf of French bread , some sort of ready-made salad , a rotisserie chicken and a bottle of wine .

" <p> Few experiences generate the combination of excitement , anguish , fun and dread as the high school reunion . No matter what we 've accomplished since graduation , the prospect of reuniting with old high school classmates can instantly transport us backfor better or worse . Before the big event , it may serve you well to brush up on a few etiquette tips to help you take on the reunion as the mature , wise adult you are today . <p> 1 . Remember who you are today . You may have felt like the mayor of Geekville in high school , but with the perspective of age and experience , you now realize that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm foothold in your life today and resist falling back into your perceived social standing , whether you were a wallflower or the head cheerleader . <p> 2 . Step out of your comfort zone . Mingle with others , even those classmates you never talked to back in the day . Pretend you are meeting people you 've never met beforeeveryone has changed since your high school days , even you . <p> 3 . Show respect for significant others . If you see your high school flame and his or her spouse , it 's fine to say hello and chat . Be friendly without flirting and keep conversation focused on the present ; it is not the time to reminisce about all the wild and crazy times you shared . If you are bringing your spouse , do n't leave them stranded alone at the punchbowl while you pal around with your old field hockey team . <p> 4 . Take stock of your personal accomplishments . Give yourself a lift by doing a written inventory of everything you 've achieved since high school : college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal bests " have been . It 's hard not to compare ourselves to others and think about where we are now versus where we thought we 'd be when we were in high school . If you were voted " Most Likely to Succeed , " but find yourself currently unemployed , do n't  let that be a deterrent from going and networking with your former classmates . You will be surprised how the economy has affected your past group of friendsits not just you . <p> 5 . Practice your poker face . While you may feel shocked at how your peers have changed , make an attempt to keep your jaw from dropping and not openly display the shock you feel : " Oh my gosh , what happened to you ? " <p> 6 . If you were a donkey ( a.k.a. an ass ) then , you do n't  have to carry it over now . Maybe you were the class clown and feel the urge to make jokes at someone else 's expense . You may have some lingering resentment toward the snotty teen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now is not the time to make up for it . You 're wise , witty and well balanced remember ? Be civil . If you find someone evokes bad feelings in you , even after all these years , do your best to move on or just avoid them . <p> 7 . Dress the part . You 'll give yourself an extra boost of confidence by dressing well and looking your best . If you have a couple of months notice , a reunion can be a great motivator to exercise and eat well . If you 're going with friends , it might be a fun to get a makeover or shop together . Do not , under any circumstances , try to fit into the same clothes you wore in high school , even if you are the same size . <p> 8 . Keep it in perspective . There 's no need to blow your budget on designer clothes or completely reinvent yourself to impress people you have n't seen since high school and will likely not see again until the next reunion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wildly successful and fabulously wealthy , stay humble , ask questions of others and do n't bore people with a long list of your accomplishments . <p> 10 . Liar , liar pants on fire . Do n't  fabricate any elaborate stories about your past or present life . Remember that the truth is only an internet search away . <p> 11 . Give your old classmates a break . That nerdy guy from homeroom may have gone on to be a rocket scientist and the girl who always managed to do just a little bit better than you on every assignment may be suffering from a recent divorce . You never know what has gone on in the past several years . Take the time to build a new and improved relationship . <p> 12 . Take it all in stride . For better or worse , the reunion will come and go and you will go back to your life better off for attending . Take advantage of seeing old friends and making new ones .

" <p> With the new year in full swing , you 're probably looking forward to taking advantage of new opportunities that will help your business grow and blossom . What you are n't  looking forward to is another year full of Client A cursing you out every time you have a meeting . Or Client B always asking for more , more , more and then complaining once they get the bill . Or Client C being so slow to respond that every project takes twice as long as is necessary . These are the clients who starve your business of the energy it needs to grow and prosper . We suggest it might be time to do some winter pruning and cut off those bad branches . <p> Bonnies mother used to tell us that seasonal pruning makes the trees grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pruning troublesome clients . When you disconnect your business from these toxic energies , your employees will be happier , you 'll be happier , and everyone will be able to focus their time and energy on more productive , more rewarding tasks . <p> Before grabbing your pruning shears , however , its important to have a plan . First , you need to truthfully evaluate the situation . Do you have more troublesome clients than happy campers ? In other words , are you the real problem ? Is the client behaving badly because you 're providing bad service or are they chronically abusive and disrespectful even when you provide great service ? Second , you have to prune with finesse . It should be done in a way that prevents bad feelings on both sides . <p> Make it about you . Explain that its not about them , but about the direction the company is heading at this time . Depending on what the case may be , tell them that you 're reorganizing , making changes due to personnel issues , focusing on a set number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to permanently burn any bridges . <p> So what kinds of clients should you consider putting on the chopping block ? Below is a list of client types that you should prune in this year : <p> The Abusers . These clients never have a kind word for you or your employees . In fact , interactions with them are usually peppered with demeaning language and expletives . Its one thing when they treat you like crap , but an abusive client being nasty to your staff is something you simply cant tolerate . Nothing can sink employee engagement and happiness faster than rude and abusive clients . I find that a popular phrase with Abusers is always " or else . " They yell at you or your employees that you better do such and such or else ! Know that you 'll never be able to please them . There will always be an " or else " looming . Know that at the end of the day , you 're in control and you get to decide whether you 're going to put up with them or not . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they do infiltrate your team . Unfortunately , once they 're working with you , they do nothing but stir up trouble . They say bad things about you to your employees and vice versa . Clients might do this because they feel like it gives them an upper hand . If they can play everyone against each other , they think they may be able to work out a better deal or keep everyone scared enough that theyll do everything they ask . Pot Stirrers are poison to a company . Its important that you nip this kind of behavior in the bud as soon as you realize its happening . <p> The Unhappy Campers . Time and again , you deliver great work , but your unhappy campers always find something to complain about . They 're never fully satisfied and their lack of gratitude has taken the wind out of you and your employees sails more than once . Unhappy Campers may not be the worst clients on your list , but they can be exhausting . When you and your staff have put time and energy into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients appreciation means a lot .

If they 're not happy , you 're not happy , and its best to cut them loose while you still have energy to give to other clients . <p> The Cheapskates . Any business owner knows that deciding on how to price your products or services is never an easy decision to make . Chances are , before presenting a client with a price list you 've already put a lot of time and thought into it , running the numbers to settle on a price that works for your business and potential customers . But Cheapskates do n't  care about any of that . They 're the clients who always ask for a discount or want to keep paying based on an outdated price list . <p> Of course , its okay to give clients a discount here and there . But Cheapskates have no problem bleeding you dry . Worst of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never pay invoices on time , causing you to have to spend time tracking them down in order to get paid .

In other words , you 're mentally thinking in black and white . " <p> Have you ever noticed that certain people tend to expect things to go badly in their marriages ( and the same is true for life in general ) ? Often , without any conscious prompting , our minds automatically jump to and fixate on the worst possible scenarios . Consider the following examples and see if any of them sound familiar : <p> * For the past three months , life at home has been great . You and your spouse are working together like a well-oiled machine . Youve been enjoying each others company and disagreements are resolved almost before they begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other shoe to drop . You think , " Why is she being so agreeable ?

Youre consumed by the thought that he is involved with someone else and is thinking of leaving you . What 's really happening : Your 15th anniversary is only a month away and your spouse is trying to plan a surprise getaway without alerting you . <p> * Its been two weeks since you asked your wife about setting up a new household budget that would allow your family to save more money . She said shed " think about it , " but has n't  said a word since . Clearly , she hates the idea , thinks you 're dumb for suggesting it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Your spouse actually thinks that beefing up your retirement account is a great idea , but somewhere between answering a few urgent work e-mails and the giving the kids a bath , your family budget dropped off her radar .

Its a case of an overactive imagination being used for i 'll . We would save ourselves a lot of suffering if we could stop our minds from dwelling on the most horrible " what ifs " we can come up with . <p> Clearly , when we expect the worst we do n't  do ourselves any favors . So why do we persist in this unhelpful mental habit ? For one thing , expecting the worst is a way to cushion ourselves emotionallywere trying to soften the blow if things go wrong . Think of the popular saying , " If you expect the worst , you 'll never be disappointed . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally pessimistic , glass half-empty attitude . And some people expect the worst because it often happens to them . Theyre caught in a self-fulfilling prophecy cycle of negativitythey do n't  even try to make positive outcomes happen anymore . <p> I used to be a master of dwelling on what could go wrong , how I might screw up , and how circumstances would conspire against me . And I paid a high price : a complete lack of mental peace , an inability to enjoy the present moment , high levels of stress and anxiety , difficulty experiencing quality rest , and more . Constantly expecting the worst can also take a toll on your relationships , your ability to trust and collaborate with others , and even your physical health . <p> Positive thinking is definitely the better , happier , and healthier path . Here are 12 strategies to help you conquer the suspicion , fear , and worries that may be driving you to expect the worst : <p> 1 . Acknowledge how busy people are . When you do n't  see results or receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be ) a timely manner , its easy to get upset and jump to the worst possible conclusion . He does n't  want to work with me . She is n't interested in making our marriage better . I did n't  get the job . And so on . But wait a second , maybe the current radio silence does n't  mean " no , " it might simply mean that the other person is busy . <p> The next time you 're waiting on a response and find yourself worrying , think through your own schedule and remind yourself how busy you often are . In this day and age , almost everybody is overscheduled and overstressed . Maybe the other person has n't  had time to decide , your suggestion dropped off their immediate radar , or they have n't even read your e-mail yet . No news does n't  necessarily mean bad news , it just may mean the other person has a lot to do ! <p> " No news does n't  necessarily mean bad news , it just may mean the other person has a lot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You cant always control how long you have to wait on an outcome , or even what that outcome is . But you can control how you wait . As I see it , you can torture yourself by dwelling on negative possibilities or you can distract yourself by staying focused on and engaged in other things . <p> Preferably , occupy yourself with tasks that use your strengths and will bolster your positive attitude and self-esteem . Whatever you do , do n't  torture yourself by sitting by the phone or computer while you fret ! Watching the metaphorical pot wont make it boil any faster . All you 're accomplishing is worsening your own mood and mental state . <p> 3 . Take a dose of muscle medicine or meditate ! Have you ever heard of a runners high ? Its a real feelingand it can help you to stop expecting the worst . That 's because exercise releases endorphins , the bodys natural feel-good chemicals . Endorphins also decrease the amount of stress hormoneslike cortisolin your body . In fact , various studies have shown that exercise can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential side effects . In other words , pumping iron or going on a run can literally melt away some of your apprehension . <p> Exercise also makes you feel more powerful , relaxes you , and enables you to sleep better ; all of which can help you to worry less . I always head to the gym whenever I cant shake a particular worry . After my workout , I feel much more at peace , and sometimes , my unconscious mind even solves my problem by coming up with a new idea or a more balanced perspective while my body has been occupied with vigorous activity . If you do n't  have an hour or so to devote to concentrated exercise , simply get outside and walk around the block a few timesit can still effectively change your mood . <p> I also recommend meditating when you 're fixated on a negative possibility . You might be surprised to learn that meditation can actually spark positive changes in your brains biochemistry . I can tell you from recent personal experience that meditation can help you deal more effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel content , and make you more mindful in the present momentall of which are helpful tools when it comes to not worrying so much about the future . <p> 4 . Take steps toward a solution . When you find yourself expecting a particular negative event ( however likely or unlikely it might be ) , ask yourself if there is anything you can do to prepare for or even prevent it . In many cases , you 'll be able to take concrete steps toward a solution . Not only will you be keeping yourself busy , you 'll also be moving from helplessness to empowerment . <p> " Your fears will hold you back , and your low self-esteem will prevent you from developing yourself and taking risks . " <p> To use a work analogy , imagine you 've heard rumors your company will be downsizing . Your worst expectation is that you 'll be laid off . Instead of fretting every day about losing your job , take steps to make yourself more valuable . Ask for feedback from your boss and incorporate her suggestions into your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succeed and improve . Take continuing education classes , if possible . All of these actions will distract you from worrying , and hopefully theyll highlight to your supervisors just how essential you are if layoffs are on the table . And if you are laid off , you 'll have made yourself into a more valuable candidate for another organization to hire . <p> 5 . Phone a friend . This " lifeline " can really help ! The next time you catch yourself ruminating on just how bad things are going to get , pick up the phone and call someone you trust . Specifically , ask your friend to help you think of several alternative outcomes ( which , by definition , ca n't be as bad as the worst-case scenario you were envisioning ) . A more neutral third party will have more perspective and will probably find it much easier to come up with not-as-bad , and even good , alternatives to help you stop thinking in extremes . <p> When you expect the worst , you 're essentially discounting thousands of other possibilities that could occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white . But the truth is , life is made up of many shades of color . Asking a friend to help you see more of those shades will talk you down from the emotional ledge you 're standing on and will help to break you out of your mental rut . <p> 6 . Retrain yourself to look for the positive . Numerous positive thinking masters and even scientists agree : The things you think about and center your attention on shape the way you experience life . In other words , if your focus is on all of the horrible , negative , crippling things that might happen to you in the future , you 'll be calling more of them into your life . How ? You 're engaging in self-sabotage . Your fears will hold you back , and your low self-esteem will prevent you from developing yourself and taking risks . At the very least , you 'll be so fixated on the worst possibilities that you might miss positive opportunities that are right under your nose . <p> Some people call this the law of attraction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from experience that if you train yourself to look for the positive , you 'll attract more positive things into your life . Youll be happier , friendlier , kinder , and more optimistic and that will bring better people and better opportunities into your orbit . <p> One of the best ways Ive found to help myself focus more on the positive is by developing an attitude of gratitude . When you 're actively being thankful for things in your life , its harder to let yourself spiral downward into negativity and have a doomsday mindset about what 's to come . Every evening , I look back on my day and identify several things I am thankful for . If something bad or disappointing happened that dayor if I 'm worried about something in the futureI challenge myself to find the silver lining . For example , if I did n't  get a speaking engagement I was hoping for , I remind myself that I wont have to spend that evening or weekend away from my family . <p> 7 . Trust the master plan . No , the universe is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a way of working out . Often , though , its impossible to see the " master plan " until you 're viewing it through the lens of hindsight . The next time you find yourself focusing on a future fear , stop and remind yourself that you 're not omniscient . You do n't  know how a dreaded event will ultimately impact your life . For instance , unbeknownst to you , maybe the job you wanted but did n't  get would have required you to travel away from your family frequently . Or maybe the pay cut that has you so worried will force your family to cut out extraneous luxuries and activities , ultimately bringing you all closer together . <p> Even if your worst expectations do come to pass ( which usually does n't  happen ) , there 's a reason why . When I look back on all of the twists and turns my own life has taken , I see that many of my fears were never validated , and the ones that did come to pass often ended up being positive turning points that helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the opposite is true as well : The things we expect to be wonderful can turn out to be unhealthy and debilitating . Just think of the stereotypical ambitious businessman who is thrilled to start a high-paying and high-powered job , only to look back in 10 years and realize that his workaholism has cost him his family and friends . <p> My point is , realizing that you cant predict how something will ultimately impact your lifethat all you can do is make the best decision possible with the information you have nowreally takes the pressure off . In all situations , especially when you 're worried and expecting the worst , I encourage you to use this Susan Jeffers affirmation : " Its all happening perfectly . " It really is ! <p> 8 . Stop being so unkind to yourself . Beating yourself up , dwelling on how inept you think you are , and engaging in negative self-talk are all unhealthy behaviors in general . What 's more , they encourage you to view the future through a worst-case-scenario lens . For example , if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might think to yourself , " I 'm so stupid and incapable . I 'm never going to move up in this company because I do n't  deserve to . Nothing ever works out well for me . " Then , you 'll probably go on to list all of your past failures in order to prove your own point . <p> Stop . Remember , we are all human , and we will all make mistakes from time to time . In the future realize that this is just one promotion you did n't  get at one particular time . That does n't  mean you wont be chosen the next time a spot opens up . Do n't  generalize your failures , and do n't  let your disappointment bleed into the future . Instead , make a point of celebrating your successes and reminding yourself of all the things you do well . <p> 9 . Try giving others the benefit of the doubt . Do you find yourself assuming the worst about other people when it comes to their attitudes and actions , especially toward you ? Say , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mild headache and is preoccupied with a work problem . However , you did n't  ask her what was wrong when you both got home for the eveningyou " read her mind " and decided that she was n't talkative because she was mad at you . As a result , you have needlessly spent the whole night in a state of anxiety . <p> Unless you actually work for the Psychic Friends Network , remind yourself that you are n't  a mind reader . Most of the time your guesses will be incorrect and will only be an upsetting waste of your time . Instead , have a conversation with the person in question . If that is n't possible , put yourself in his or her shoes and list reasons why you might behave in a similar way . You 'll probably realize that the other individual is n't out to get you after all . <p> " Sometimes the simple act of putting pen to paper can help you to break the vicious cycle of mental worrying . " <p> 10 . Live in the moment Seriously , take time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this old adage is fundamentally solid advice . To put it simply , when you 're engaged in the here and now , you 're focused on a reality that you can control , and youre in a position to notice and appreciate all of the blessings around you . But if you 're fretting about what might come to pass , you do n't  have enough bandwidth left to enjoy other aspects of your life . You 're exacerbating your anxiety and unhappiness by choosing to dwell on things you ca n't change or control . <p> It may sound simple , but the following exercise has really helped me . Whenever you catch yourself worrying about the future , stop what you 're doing and close your eyes . Concentrate on breathing in and out for a few moments . Then , open your eyes and use all of your senses to anchor you to the present moment . Look out the window and enjoy the view . Smell the scent that 's coming from an air freshener or a candle . Pet your dog and notice the soft feel of her fur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or completing a task that you have control over . Often , that 's all it takes to break out of a debilitating mental rut ! <p> 11 . But take a mental trip to the future when you find yourself dreading the worst . When were expecting the worst , we tend to wear mental blinders . All we can see is the thing were dreading . As far as were concerned , the world ends with that event or outcome . But does it really ? Take a step back and look again . The truth is , even when things do n't  go our way , life goes on . That 's why I believe its so helpful to take a mental trip to the future when you 're dreading the worst . <p> Imagine that your worst expectations come true . Now , fast-forward six months , a year , or even five or 10 years in your mind . Is that dreaded event still impacting your life ? Has it made you permanently unhappy , restricted your options or blown your bank account ? In most instances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months or a year , the thing you fear probably wont even be on your radar anymore . ( And if it is , figure out what you can do now to prevent it or minimize its impact . ) " Traveling to the future " is a great tool for putting negative expectations into contextand more importantly , out of your mind ! <p> 12 . Write it out . Our anxieties can often seem bigger and scarier the longer we allow them to float around in our heads . The remedy ? Sit down and write out the things that you are afraid of . As you do , consider each one . " Where does this worry come from ? Is it internal or is it from an outside source ? Is it likely to happen ? How will it impact me if it does ? " <p> Sometimes the simple act of putting pen to paper can help you to break the vicious cycle of mental worrying . I recommend recording your fears in a format you can revisit , such as a journal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or failed to happen ) , look back at what you wrote and compare your expectations to what actually occurred . This will help you hone and balance your perspective as you move into the future . <p> Things really do have a way of working out . It can be hard to accept that truth and choose to let go of your worrying , especially if its a long-standing habit , but I promise when you learn to manage your expectations , take the focus off your fears , and be productive in the present moment , your life will be so much healthier and happier .

With my pride in check , not wanting to be publicly humiliated I smiled and answered , " Oh , about five times a week .

Do not fall into the trap of measuring your happiness against someone elses measuring stick . If you are happy with the sex in your relationship , then you are normal . No measuring sticks needed . 113806 @qwx733806

JONES <p> Depositphoto Before you consider taking the final steps in your relationship make these considerations . <p> " Some insurance policies now contain provisions which excludes coverage following separation , or what is referred to in some states as a ' divorce from bed and board . ' " <p> What is the difference between a separation and a divorce ? With a separation , you may be living in a different residence than your spouse , but you are still legally married . With a divorce , the marriage is legally over , even if you still happen to be living with your ex . A person may seek a separation instead of a divorce , or vice versa , for various reasons . Five common considerations include the following : <p> 1 . Genuine Possibility of Saving the Marriage : If you want to live separate from your spouse , but believe that there is a reasonable chance of saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separation instead of a divorce . Of course , some people reconcile and even re-marry each other after divorce . Meanwhile , you may have spent substantial time and money unnecessarily by jumping the gun to divorce and terminate the marriage , only to change your mind after the fact . <p> 2 . Health Insurance : A frequent reason why some people do not choose to divorce is because they wish to stay on their spouses work-related family health insurance plan . Generally , an ex-spouse does not qualify as a family member following divorce , but in some instances may " COBRA " the health insurance benefits at a price which for many people is very expensive and cost-prohibitive . COBRA stands for " Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act " and is a federal law that may allow you to temporarily keep health coverageyou pay 100% of the premiums plus a small administration fee . <p> If , however , the parties are separated but still married , it is possible , but not guaranteed that the non-employed spouse may remain on the policy . Some policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is referred to in some states as a " divorce from bed and board . " Therefore , if health insurance is a concern , it is important to first carefully check the specific language of the insurance policy to make certain that you fully understand how separation may affect your coverage . <p> 3 . Joint Income Tax Filings : Another reason some couples prefer separation over divorce is if they are still technically married they may be able to file a joint tax return by mutual arrangement , and share any resulting refund . Some people may do substantially better on their tax returns by filing jointly instead of separately . Other people , however , choose not to file a joint return , particularly if a spouses purported income is questionable or lacking in credibility . <p> 4 . Unequivocal Desire to End Marriage : Some people are so absolutely certain of their desire to end a marriage that they want a divorce yesterday . They do not want to spend additional time , money , and energies delaying the inevitable by first undergoing a lengthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divorce for a long time . <p> 5 . Establish " End of Marriage " Date : Some people prefer filing for divorce in an effort to establish an " end of marriage " date . In many states , the cut-off date for determining the end of the parties marriage is not the date of the judgment of divorce , but the date of filing the complaint for divorce . For example , if parties have been married for exactly nine years , and they then separate and live apart for two years before either party files a complaint for divorce , a court may possibly consider the marriage to have been 11 years rather than 9 years in length . The marriage length can potentially impact issues such as alimony , and may also possibly affect the distribution of assets acquired during the period after separation , which is considered part of the marriage . While a couple can agree to a different cutoff date , such as the date of the separation , this may potentially require the consent of both parties or decree of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be other personal considerations on the issue of separation versus divorce .

" <p> With so many problems in marriages these days , how do you build and keep trust ? Everyone talks about the importance of trust in relationships , but what does that really mean ? If you do n't  trust partner , for instance , you 're more likely to be frustrated , anxious , depressed , angry , sad , preoccupied , tense and the list goes on and on .

We 've been married for 13 years , and honestly , except for this problem we are very happy . I 've never been a very sexual person and I do n't become aroused on my own very often .

It may very well be , just as others go through a " honeymoon phase , " where everything in the relationship is more intense that you also had a higher libido . In other words , how you functioned then was more a by-product of being in the early throes of love rather than a realistic picture of your comfort level with affection and sexuality . <p> The first thing I would suggest is that you have a complete medical and gynecological work-up . Make sure to let your doctors know this problem . You want to rule out any possible physical problems . <p> You can also consult with a sex therapist .

Humans need touch . However , if this was not something you were given as a child , it would lead to you feeling awkward about it now . <p> Even worse than your parents not offering you physical nurturance is the possibility that there was abuse in your home .

What I would like you to take away from my response is that this is an important concern both for you individually and as a couple . It certainly merits you speaking to someone professionally . The good news is that any one of these situations can be worked on and resolved . <p> I know that if you apply the same courage it took to write in about this and face this issue , you will be successful in working it through .

If you fight about the same kinds of things over and over again , you 're not alone . Healthy couples fightand its the sign of a healthy relationship to tussle and get things out in the open . Fighting does n't  mean that somethings wrong ; it means that something is surfacing that needs attention . A bigger problem is a lack of conflict , engagement , and fighting .

@@79604781 @1104781/ <p> How frequent are affairs ? It depends on how you define affairs , who you ask , and how they interpret the numbers . Among experts , there is no consensus on this issue . One of the most widely acknowledged statistics is this : about 1.5 percent of people will have an affair for each year of marriage . Not so bad , you might think . But that 's only per year . In other words , after ten years the rates go up to 15 percent , and after twenty years , 30 percent of married people have had an affair . <p> This statistic highlights a paradox . Most people assume that the longer a couple has been married , the greater the strength of the union . Thats supported by the data that show that an awful lot of spouses end their marriage within the first few years . But , the longer you 're married , the more time you have for things to happen : the more likely you are to win the lottery , get in a car accident , or see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why some researchers at the University of Chicago have come up with what appear to be puzzling findings . While they show pretty consistently that every year , 10 percent of spouses admit to cheating ( 12 percent of husbands , 7 percent of wives ) , people who are over the age of 60 actually have the highest rates of infidelity over a lifetime . For those of you who think of this population as the ones who populate the " Help Ive Fallen and I Ca n't Get Up " commercials , remember that , at the time of the study , 60-year-olds would have included Mick Jagger , Eric Clapton , Tina Turner , and Carly Simon . I 'm not saying that any of these rock stars had affairs , but I am painting a picture for you of what life was like when people who are now sixty were coming of age .

When Shere Hite , author of the Hite Report , published data on affairs , she concluded that 70 percent of American women who were married for more than five years had broken their marriage vows at least once . I know that sounds outrageous ; even I think that 's out of bounds . But I recall a very unscientific discussion with one of my mentors from medical school , who maintained a very successful Park Avenue practice , and he claimed that every single one of his patients had had an affair at one time or another . <p> The take-home message from all this research is loud and clear . Affairs are not rare . Remember that exercise you did in your assemblies in high school ( whether the subject was bullying , drug addiction , or STDs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells you to look to your right , then look to your left , and that either you or one of the people you are looking at will be affected by ( fill in the blank with bullying , drug addiction , STDs , or whatever else the speaker is trying to convince you to avoid ) . Well , I 'm that speaker . Look to the house on the left of you , look to the house on the right . Research tells us that your home or one of these other two homes will have someone who is affected by infidelity . <p> If that home is yours , it does n't  mean you have to lose hope or lose face .

" That 's one of the hardest parts in recovering from the cheating when your spouse looks you right in the eye and lies , " says Harley . " And of course , it makes it ten times worse . " <p> The morning following the confrontation , Mike , 40 , tried to initiate a conversation with Lynn . She asked him point blank : " You did do it , did n't  you ? " He admitted he did . Lynn was doubly upset for his initial lies , and then herself for the constant apologies for making " false " accusation . Mike admitted his struggle to confess over the last few weeks , but did n't  " have the guts . " Even when confronted , he felt the need to protect himself . " I was devastated , " says Lynn .

Evidence points to a high correlation between online cyber sex and a sexual affair . The Greenfield and Rivet survey revealed that 31 percent of those who have had an online conversation say it has led to real-time sex . Mike and Becca had become another statistic , as their first encounter found Mike leaving the house in the middle of the night , unbeknownst to Lynn , for a secret rendezvous in a parking lot . Other times , Mike would meet Becca at a friends house he had a key to .

" For the longest time Tyler had been erasing the ( web ) history , and I thought it was just broken .

" <p> --Alysia <p> Harley says romances are sought by those wanting their important emotional needs met . Using the internet to find such partners creates a strange combination of intimacy without real intimacy . " Its an emotional high that is very comparable to heroin addiction , " says Harley . " Many of these online meetings do not reach a sexual affair , but its still an affair . " In the program he runs , Harley has found an equal number of men and women whove admitted to cyber cheating . <p> While Lynn says there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived somewhat separate lives for some time . Mike had pushed her away when the stress of their business grew , and despite the emotional distance , Lynn made a conscious decision to remain in the marriage . " My mom has been married multiple times and I did n't  want that , " says Lynn . Mike said he went looking for someone to talk to and Becca fulfilled the need , which then turned physical . <p> Tyler also revealed he sought companionship because he felt unhappy in his marriage to Alysia . Filled with anger and hurt over the secrets and betrayal , Alysia knew it was over . Hindsight being 20/20 , Alysia knows now she was n't being truthful to herself either . " We werent in love with each other . He was always on my nerves , and we did n't  have sex . I very soon realized he did me a favor .

But then she rationalized , " When somebody lies to you , that is not the person I love . " <p> Never contemplating reconciliation , Alysia explains , " I knew I would not ever feel comfortable with him again . I did n't  want to spend the rest of my life feeling anxious every time his cell phone rang . I cant and I wont live my life that way . " Although Tyler claimed he never had sex with either of the women , it did n't  matter to Alysia . " The problem is there . Deception is deception . " <p> Some may disagree that flirtatious or even salacious e-mails do not equal infidelity or warrant the same wrath a sexual encounter might , but Harley has found that whether or not the affair was consummated , the damage is the same . Alysia adds that for her it was also about her sense of self-respect and integrity . " I think that its definitely an individual choice and the quality of life you want to have , " says Alysia . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little piece of you dies . " <p> While she did n't  want to follow in the footsteps of her twice-divorced parents , Alysia divorced Tyler and could n't feel happier . With no children , leaving for Alysia was undoubtedly a bit easier than those who have already started a family together . <p> Lynn , however , was willing to try and agreed to Mikes plea . They never opted for a separation largely because they felt they would be unable to work things out living apart , and because their three children were all 11 years and younger and the holidays were just around the corner . Mike , however , was still on a tight leash and Lynn gave the condition that if things were not going as she had hoped , she would ask him to leave . <p> Reconciliation <p> The road to recovery for couples dealing with infidelity is a long and difficult one , says Harley , and it generally consists of two parts . First , the person can never see or talk to the lover again . Since the internet has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no easy feat , and Harley says while it sounds extreme , many times it comes down to getting rid of the computer altogether . " Very much like dealing with an alcoholic , you 've got to take the source of the addiction away from them , " says Harley . He s worked with many couples that tried to find alternative approaches , but in the end they had to eliminate the computer . In some cases , the cell phone is banned during the early stages . If throwing out the computer seems drastic , Harley also brings to light one other troubling thought : " you can go to extreme precautions to avoid contact with that lover , but many are addicted to internet affairs , not just a particular person . They may have a bunch of people lined up with who they 're carrying on with simultaneously . " <p> The second step in recovery , says Harley , is creating a romantic relationship in your own marriage , which is difficult to do for the betrayed spouse . " They have to develop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious offense they 've felt in life and that whole combination of things makes you wonder if it is even possible . " However , Harley says hundreds of couples overcome those obstacles every year in his program . <p> Without seeing a counselor , Mike and Lynn instead began reconnecting by first talking constantly . " Though there 's never ever an excuse for what he did , " says Lynn , " There were problems in our marriage . " Together for 16 years and married for 12 of them , she admits distance had grown between them . " We made a recommitment to each other , putting our marriage first rather than our jobs , our children and all the activities going on in our lives first . " <p> A marked improvement took hold on Lynn and Mikes marriage . They began e-mailing each other at work , something they had never done before . Their increased communication has made Lynn reach out to Mike for anything and for Mike , he now looks forward to coming home and spending time with his wife and kids . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with , but he s like a different person ; he s better , " says Lynn . " Were trying so hard to make sure everything we do is about the two of us . " <p> Though shes slowly building trust in Mike , she still finds herself feeling anxious when Mike does n't  pick up his phone . " I still have twinges and I do n't  trust him completely , " says Lynn . However , she 's glad she did n't  leave the marriage . " My husband and I have both said it totally sucks that this is going to be the best thing that happened to our marriage . Its taken us to a level we 've never been at before . " Reluctant to say , the affair was the catalyst for change and Lynn realizes it forced them to communicate about things they had been silent about for far too long . <p> *Editors note : due to the sensitivity of this subject , the names of the couples have been changed . <p> While infidelity runs rampant in our society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly , you can avoid the likelihood of it ever happening . " It takes meeting several emotional needs at once , " says Dr. Willard F. Harley , Jr. , author of several books on the subject and founder of marriage counseling center , Marriage Builders . When most reveal that sex is n't what drives the affair Harley agrees its absolutely true , citing the lack of a romantic relationship causing many to seek others to fulfill their emotional needs . <p> " There are really four emotional needs that are primarily romantic : affection , intimate conversation , recreational companionship and sexual fulfillment , " says Harley . " If you have a romantic relationship in your own marriage , an affair is much easier to resist . " If you suspect your spouse might be doing something unsavory , Harley feels you have every right to investigate , whether by installing tracking software on the computer or even hiring a private investigator . If anything is found , Harley advises saving the evidence for the confrontation .

Basically , he was intimating that his wife should have no complaints about his strong sex drive . According to him , she simply needed to understand that his sexual readiness most mornings or nights was really outside his control . It was just a fact of nature , which she should accept ; especially if she wanted to make him happy . <p> Although we women also have sex drives that peak according to our monthly cycle with the rise of our sexual hormones , there may be nothing that quite prepares us for the strength and voracity of the male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to note that women also like and need sex . Sex is not the exclusive purview of men , and women need to get this .

Men often crave sex on demand while women want sex accompanied by connection and emotional intimacy . So how do we respond to this common relationship challenge ? Our response is often contingent upon our emotional maturity , our understanding of ourselves and our partner , and our willingness ( at times ) to put our spouse 's needs before our own . <p> While many of us assume that adults having sex should be able to handle the responsibility a sexual relationship brings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily the case . The fact that we enter relationships or get married with several emotional deficits means that our expectations can often be skewed in a direction , which magnifies personal gratification above all else . In other words , the needier we are emotionally the less willing we are to accede to the needs of someone else . This can inculcate a self-centered drive in either individual to have his/her needs met at all costs . <p> When a refusal to grow up emotionally is extended into the sexual relationship , the result can be damaging . A wife may deliberately withhold sex or other demonstrations of affection simply because an emotional or financial need remains unmet , while a husband may withhold affection because he is unhappy sexually . A dearth of sex for most men can also lead to responses ranging from childish petulance to anger and emotional withdrawal . Of course some husbands fail to realize that " punishing " their wives is unlikely to bring them any closer to candy-land , but women understand this knee-jerk response and are often prepared with their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , counterproductive and will serve to drive a further wedge in the marriage . <p> Emotional maturity means being able to put the needs of our partner before our own ; and it also means dealing with issues as soon as they come to light , without allowing them to fester and spill over into the bedroom . This has implications for the importance of communication . It is necessary that we attempt to understand and accept the intrinsic differences between men and women . When we embrace the fact that our needs and priorities are different , then this can relieve much relationship tension . Recognizing that no amount of sex or no amount of emotional engagement will make us completely happy is also critical . <p> While healthy relating and engagement are essential components of a successful marriage , a healthy dose of self-acceptance and self-love are also critical .

In short , an immediate annuity allows a person to convert a sum of money into a guaranteed series of payments for a period equal to the greater of the person 's life or a certain number of years . <p> SPIA sales have been relatively flat for years , however sales have recently been growing at a 25 to 30 percent annual rate , reaching $2.4 billion in 2008 . This demand and growth will most likely continue for the foreseeable future . <p> By now , most Americans are familiar with the risks inherent to investing . Market risk , inflation risk , interest rate risk are all items that investors have grown accustomed to managing . These risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are joined by a new risklongevitywhich is the possibility that you might outlive your assets . An investment in a SPIA is one of the few steps an investor can take to manage this risk . <p> Longevity risk is often misunderstood . Though many have seen articles and studies on life expectancy , longevity is something completely different . Life expectancy is defined by the expected life span of a person born today . That life span is often limited by childhood illness , disease and accidents . Longevity is defined by the average lifespan of someone who has already survived to age 65 and thus has a much longer expected life span . <p> In fact , current actuarial tables indicate that a healthy 65-year-old married couple has a 50 percent chance that one person will survive all the way to age 92 . There 's even a 25 percent likelihood that one person will make it to 97 !

In exchange for a single , lump-sum investment or premium payment , an insurance company will guarantee an investor a fixed income payment for life . Similar to a defined-benefit or pension plan , this income is steady , predictable and guaranteed by the insurance company to continue for the entire lifetime of the investor . The frequency of the payments is determined by the investor as well and payments may be received monthly , quarterly or annually . The investor may also decide the level of beneficiary protection they would like . These options include : <p> 1 . Life or Joint Life Only : With this option , payments are guaranteed to the investor for as long as they and their spouse live . However , once the surviving spouse passes away , the income payments stop and nothing is paid to beneficiaries . <p> 2 . Life or Joint Life with Period Certain : This option also guarantees income for life , but it includes some beneficiary protection . Let 's say , for example , an investor purchases a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investor and their spouse both pass away after only receiving 10 years of income . In this case , the stated beneficiaries of the contract will receive the remaining 10 years of guaranteed income , thereby fulfilling the contracts 20-year income component . <p> 3 . Life or Joint Life with Cash Refund : This option guarantees income for life too , but comes with a different form of beneficiary protection . In this example , let 's say an investor purchases a Joint Life with Cash Refund contract for $200,000 . Then , both spouses pass away after receiving just $50,000 in income . With this contract , the insurance company will return or " refund " the $150,000 difference to the contracts stated beneficiaries . <p> Other annuitization options are available but the three listed above are , by far , the most popular . <p> Besides guaranteed lifetime income , SPIAs have other advantages too .

After an initial year of hot , wild , bunny-like mayhem , their sex life turned into a dull routine . To add insult to injury , having kids made their sex erratic to the point of non-existent . Theyve long since learned that sex does not magically happen . Even still they are stymied by a lack of time and energy and have thus spiraled into apathy . Their heart-breaking reality is that they love each other and want to keep an intimate connection but do n't  know how . <p> In this universal relationship catch-22 , superficially it seems like Jack and Jill have a one-way ticket to lifelong sexual misery . Interestingly , they are simply at a crucial sexual juncture and consciously or unconsciously must make a tough life choice . <p> The first , most common and by far easiest choice is to throw all their energy into a distraction such as their job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distraction becomes the " responsible " excuse why they 're not working on their sex life . In this scenario , both feel and act like victimsnot the best way to revive a flagging sex life . <p> The second least common and much harder choice is to take a frank inventory of their sex life and with unshakeable resolve move forward to change what is not working . <p> How can you take this high road ? Oddly enough , by pulling a chapter out of business acumen and creating sex goals . A sex goal is exactly as it sounds : a long-term objective you want to have happen within your sex life . <p> A good starting place is to craft a specific vision of what you want the end result to be . What does your perfect sex life look like ? Or how would you describe a perfect sexual encounter ? The more detailed you are , the easier it will be to paint a memorable picture in your headsometimes it 's the only thing that keeps a couple hanging in when times get tough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a self-defeating uber-goal like , " Well have sex two times per week . " There 's too much unresolved sex-baggage that needs to be worked on before you can comfortably go from no sex , to anticipating , wanting and having sex twice a week . Instead , having sex twice a week might become your end vision . <p> Therefore , mini-sex goals are a more realistic approach . Turning long ingrained relationship ruts around has to be done with small , incremental baby steps that are easy to digest , take on , show progress and do not require major life upheavals . <p> An example of a mini-sex goal would be making a commitment every day to show some type of non-sexual , affectionate contact . This can look like a lingering hug , kiss on the cheek or bum squeeze . This mini-sex goal is easy , doable and cements a solid foundation to tackle bigger sexual challenges . Once you have moved to making your mini-sex goal an unconscious habit , only then can you move on to your next mini-sex goal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What ? No instant gratification ? " That 's correct . Creating new healthy sex habits thatll last a lifetime neither come easy nor fast because they can only grow organically . You will see a positive changejust not on your time line . <p> Remember to get a " buy-in " from your partner . Your sex goal is not something to be done in secret . Healthy communication , negotiation and mutual respect need to take place if your end vision is to come to happy fruition . <p> Next is the most exciting and also most discouraging part of the equation : putting your mini-sex goal into action . This initially appears in the honeymoon stage where " goal-haze " gives you an artificial sense of " Weve got this thing under control . " You and your partner are focused , enthusiastic and excited about the new idea . <p> However , after the haze wears off and unresolved sticky issues start popping up , there 's a huge propensity to avoid one another and go back to your old sex routine , thus plunging you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its a good idea to do progress check-ins from time to time . Your agreement might be to sit down every three months and reflect upon how much growth ( if any ) has occurred . Ask each other whether of not you put in a good effort . Did you allow each other to slide back into your old sex habits ? What went well ? How can you keep up the momentum ? In the end , do everything to keep the lines of communication flowing . <p> Ultimately , the choices you make will be reflected in the quality of relationship you experience . Remember , sex goals do mean work and give a beacon of hope where there was once none . 113806 @qwx733806

So it seems perfectly logical to assume there would be a positive correlation between the frequency of dancing between the sheets and ones level of happiness and satisfaction with said romantic relationship . Logic is one thing , but the real answer to the question , " Does more humping make you happieror provide any other benefits ? " is a resounding " It depends " ( and yes , as a creative writing challenge , I 've decided not to use the word " sex " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes " side , various studies have found a connection between limb mingling and a stronger immune system , lower blood pressure , reduced heart attack risk , improved sleep , lower stress levels , better memory and analytic skills , an increase in brain-cell building , and reduced anxiety and depression . <p> One study published in The Journal of Urology even found that rolling in the hay could reduce prostate cancer risk .

Men who ejaculated 21 times per month had a 20 percent lower risk of developing prostate cancer than those show orgasmed " only " 4-7 times per month , according to the studys lead author , Harvard epidemiologist , Jennifer Rider . <p> The circumstances of your coital bliss are also important .

Tim Wadsworth , a sociologist at the University of Colorado Boulder , has a pretty good idea . Compared to those who did n't  have intercourse at all in the previous year , Wadsworth found that people who get busy 2-3 times per month are 33 percent more likely to report high levels of happiness . Those who do the deed once a week are 44 percent more likely to report high levels of happiness , and those who make like bunnies two or three times per week are 55 percent more likely . <p> But be careful : the nookie-to-happiness ratio is n't just a numbers game .

" Having more sex* makes us happy , but thinking that we are having more sex than other people makes us even happier .

But George Leowenstein , an economist at Carnegie Mellon University , was n't clear on which one of the two caused the other .

The questionnaires asked participants about their about happiness levels , how often they shagged , and how much they enjoyed it . <p> The couples in the increase-it group did , indeed , boost their boffing , but the results werent what Leowenstein and his team were expecting . " Contrary to what one would expect if the causal story running from sexual frequency to happiness were true , " they wrote in their paper , " we observed a weak negative impact of inducing people to have more sex on mood .

Neurological science shows that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a certain type of partner , re-create dysfunctional patterns in your relationships and friendships , or even take on jobs where co-workers and bosses treat you inappropriately , its likely due to harmful patterns that have been programmed into your brain since childhoodand they are much , much harder to break than you may think . <p> If we want to stop perpetuating bad relationships , we must understand what 's causing the problem . <p> First , we need to become aware of how incredibly tough it is for people to alter their subconscious behavior patterns . This knowledge will hopefully change the way we approach our relationship choices . Second , we need to educate people on the shocking extent to which lifelong difficulties and dysfunctions are connected to parenting . <p> My intention is not to shame or needlessly frighten parents , but to educate them in order to spark positive change . The majority of parents do want the best for their children and are themselves victims of negative parenting and erroneous cultural beliefs . <p> Here , I share four surprising truths about the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Truth 1 : Childhood Experiences Determine How the Brain Develops During the first few years of life , beginning in the womb , there is a huge burst in the amount of neural connectivity that takes place in the brain . Depending on what we see and experience during this time , certain mental " pathways " are reinforced while other , less used connections are pruned and eliminated to make the brain more efficient . <p> New research in epigenetics is also showing that our experiences during this time determine how certain genes are expressed , and even whether they 're expressed at all . <p> " We need to educate people on the shocking extent to which lifelong difficulties and dysfunctions are connected to parenting . " <p> Truth 2 : Certain Behaviors and Patterns are Hardwired Into Our Brains During Childhood The neural programming that happens in childhood canand doeslast long after children have grown up . Their lifelong behaviors ( both conscious and subconscious ) are based on this programming , as is their cognitive development , sense of empathy , moral sensitivity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout our lives , it becomes limited after early childhood , and established neural pathways are very difficult to change . So despite what conventional " wisdom " says , expecting someone to leave negative childhood experiences in the past is often asking the impossible . <p> Truth 3 : Dysfunctional Neural Connections Can ( and Often Do ) Manifest in Adult Relationships So , what does this science look like in real life , so to speak ? Here are a few examples . <p> * The hippocampi of neglected children are up to 10 percent smaller than those of children with caring , loving mothers . Memory , stress control , and the ability to learnall of which play an important role in building healthy relationshipscan be negatively impacted . <p> * A lack of parental affection , attention , and physical contact impacts moral development and can limit empathy and moral sensitivity to others . This can lead to cruel , distant , and critical behavior within relationships . <p> " Children who are parented with violence ( yes , this includes practices like spanking and slapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive ability . " <p> * Children who are parented with violence ( yes , this includes practices like spanking and slapping ) score lower on IQ tests and other tests of cognitive ability . Additionally , their brains can become overwhelmed with stress , leading to faulty stress response systems that contribute to irrational behaviors such as hypervigilance , violence toward others , and revictimization . <p> Truth 4 : Adults Often Repeat the Relationship Patterns They Observed During Childhood While the neural programming that takes place in childhood has a profound impact on childrens lifelong relationships , there 's more to the story . The basic patterns a child observes between caretakers ( which are themselves programmed into his brain through neural connections ) also make a strong impact on the childs brain . <p> While there are as many negative patterns as there are families , here are some common examples that children tend to relive throughout their lives . <p> * If a parent is absent a lot or very busy doing other things and does n't  make the child a priority , even from infancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with partners who are busy and do not make that person a priority . Alternatively , the child may grow up to be the perpetrator of that behavior . <p> * If a child witnessed the childs father often angry and critical toward the childs mother in a continuing , recurring way ( or the other way around with the mother being often angry and critical ) , then the child is likely to relive relationships in which the child is either angry and critical toward a partner or is the victim of a similar pattern . <p> * If a parent is self-absorbed and puts family members last in his life , then that is the type of relationship the child will likely grow up to re-create . He might prioritize work and friends over spending time at home , or vice versa . <p> * If one of the parents engages in alcoholism or other types of substance abuse , then the child is likely to relive alcoholism in her life either in a partner or on her own . <p> * If the childs parents tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engage in relationships in life that involve frequent loud arguments . <p> * If one parent tends to ignore childcare responsibilities , leaving the other to handle them , then the child is likely to grow up to re-create a similar pattern with his or her partner in adulthood . <p> * If one or both parents are spendthrifts and do not save money for the family , leaving the children with a lack of money , the child may grow up to re-experience a lack of money or being a last priority financially ( e.g. , not getting raises at work when others do ) . <p> " The relationship between a child and his or her parents serves as the foundation for all of that childs future relationships . " <p> The repetition of negative patterns explains why so many people find themselves inexplicably attracted to someone who is bad for them . A lot of people also find that when they meet someone with whom they would have a very positive , peaceful , supportive , and honest relationship , they feel repelled or uninterested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child and his or her parents serves as the foundation for all of that childs future relationships . Infants and small children need to experience love and positive attachment behaviors from their primary caregivers in order to conduct relationships optimally throughout life . <p> In addition , parents should strive to maximize patterns that create positive channels in the brain . For example , a parent who has a passion for cooking may choose to spend positive time in the kitchen with his child , thereby developing a lifelong love for cookingand maybe even inspiring the child to become a chef . <p> On a broader level , my hope is that we will begin to see meaningful change in the education provided to parents , in our nations policies and laws pertaining to the rights of children , and in increased funding in the area of mental health treatment .

Parents have a huge role too . <p> " Giving too much assistance may cause your child to become too dependent on you while not giving enough may cause frustration . " <p> Parents are their childrens first and most important teachers . In this critical role parents have the greatest impact on their kids academic , physical , social , and moral development and the greatest impact on their childrens motivation to learn . In my experience , parents are typically eager to do everything in their power to contribute to their childrens success in school , but they 're not always shown how to do this . The following suggestions will help parents empower their kids to be the best they can be . <p> 1 . Commit yourselves to playing an active role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for their childs education solely with the teacher . No matter how satisfied you may be with your childs teacher ( and I hope you are very satisfied ) , this practice is unwise .

Repeatedly express to your child how important it is to work hard , take school seriously , and achieve as much as possible academically . Explain all the benefits that come from learning , such as increased pride and confidence , greater educational and career options , and a greater ability to participate in community affairs and activities . You can never repeat this message too many times . <p> 3 . Develop a homework policy with your child . No television until all homework is complete ? No play time ? Discuss these issues with your child so that both of you are clear about your familys expectations for home study . Then , be sure to hold your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not require a nightly battle . <p> 4 . Provide your child with a quiet study area . If possible , supply a desk and a spot to keep all necessary books and materials organized . With or without a desk , however , its critical that your child have a consistent , well-lit place to study that is free from distractions . Providing such an atmosphere will not only enable your child to have an easier time studying , but also it will send a clear message that you think doing homework is an important priority . <p> 5 . Do n't do their homework for them . Encourage your child to complete homework activities as independently as possible ; offer help only when necessary . Giving too much assistance may cause your child to become too dependent on you while not giving enough may cause frustration . Strive to achieve the right balance so that your child exercises responsibility while you still remain actively involved in overseeing their efforts , both on daily homework activities and during long-term projects and test preparation . <p> 6 . Keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all notices that your childs teacher and the school office send home . Do your best to stay on top of these matters . <p> 7 .

But what happens when your other half no longer mentally stimulates you or perhaps , in reality , was never really able to stimulate you at all ? How do you break the bad news and more importantly , start on the road to improvement ? <p> The first step , advises marriage and family therapist Kristen Harrington , is to determine whether its an issue that has existed from the beginning or one that has grown into one with the evolution of the marriage . If the lack of mental stimulation has , indeed , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important the issue is to you and to what extent you should make it an issue that concerns the two of you . <p> For Megan , 26 , the mental disconnect was an issue from the beginning of her relationship with Gerald , 28 , her boyfriend of seven years and husband of one . <p> " I realized we had a problem when he told me he had been to the Sistine Chapel and could n't even describe what it was like to be there , " says Megan . " Maybe that 's a guy thing , but it 's the Sistine Chapel for crying out loud . " <p> At that time , Megan was still in college and surrounded by friends who were able to help provide what was lacking in her relationship with Gerald , so she let the issue slide .

Instead , I just asked him to do more things with me like go to museums or the theater . " <p> According to Harrington , Megan was on the right track when she approached Gerald . <p> " Tell them things that they can do , as opposed to just saying , Youre dull and you 're not my mental equal , " says Harrington . " That kind of thing can really affect a person a lot . Theyll really feel let down . So figure out ahead of time what 's realistic and ask for part of it . Ask them too if they would see the benefit of doing that with you . I think its really important that you speak about it , approach them with the positives first and then give them the behavior change request .

With this in mind , try to be as reasonable and as realistic as possible in your request . In the best case , you 'll find that your spouse just needed an invitation to grow and will gladly accept the opportunity to show you how mentally stimulating he can actually be . <p> In the worst case , the lack of mental stimulation will lead to other consequences and may even result in a decrease in sexual attraction . <p> " A big ' turn on ' for me is a guy that can share something with me on a more intimate , ' mental ' level , " admits Megan . " Because I was n't getting that from Gerald , he was becoming less and less sexually attractive to me . " <p> According to Harrington , this is a normal consequence , especially for women . <p> " If there 's a lack of stimulating discussion outside , they 're going to generally feel less stimulated in the bedroom because they feel less valued as a person , " says Harrington . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion . " <p> In the case that your spouse has become less mentally stimulating as the relationship has evolved , Harrington advises to take a moment to think about the ways in which your spouse used to be more mentally stimulating before approaching him with the subject . <p> " Did they have good discussions about current events ? " says Harrington . " Did they like to go to museums ? Did they ask challenging questions that really caused their partner to think about things ? What were the specifics ? That 's the kind of behavior that you could ask for again . Let them know that had meant a lot to you and you really miss it and youd love to have it again . " <p> In the event that your spouse shrugs it off or does n't  take your request seriously , tell him or her how its affecting you . " Are you bored ? " asks Harrington . " Are you less attracted to them as a result ? How does it affect you ? Put it in terms that really are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues change , and staying on the same page as your spouse can be difficult . But approach the subject with love and support and suggestions of what your spouse can do , and you 'll have a better chance at finding your way to a common path . If all has been said and done and you 're still not connecting , then take a deep look at what you truly want out of life . <p> Even after Megan asked for more , Gerald was n't able to provide her with the mental stimulation that she needed , and Megan recently decided to call it quits . In her case , divorce was the ultimate answer . To prevent a similar outcome , make sure that you have approached the situation in every way possible to find a common solution together .

Similar to sympathy , empathy takes us from feeling bad for someones predicament to a place where we actual put ourselves in their shoes and feel what they are feeling as if it were happening to us . <p> I think Actress Rosie Perez said it best in the movie " White Men Ca n't Jump " when she said , " When your wife is thirsty , empathy says , ' I too know what it is to thirst . ' Compassion says the same thing and then gets up and gets her a bottle of water . " <p> If empathy is to feel another persons suffering , compassion is to feel it and then try to comfort them as if their pain were your pain . Simple enough , right ? Well not exactly . <p> Compassion is not about fixing . Its about understanding and comforting . For many , husbands who have to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the kids now positions themselves in a role to now become the " fixer " and immediately offer solutions or make decisions to solve the perceived problem . These poor guys and gals ( there are " fixer " wives out there too ) are missing the most essential key to a compassionate marriageunderstanding . Compassion begins with understanding on an emotional level , the reason for our partners suffering . The trouble is that understanding our spouse means that they have to understand the root of their suffering first . <p> Recognizing Compassionate Moments Now I know that suffering may sound like an extreme description for a tough day at the office or a minor misunderstanding between spouses , but I use this word on purpose . When we are stressed , overwhelmed , upset or emotionally disconnected from our loved ones ( even briefly ) , the emotional response is one of suffering . It is real and it is powerful and the first step to truly understanding our partner and ourselves is to acknowledge the magnitude of " minor issues " on our well-being . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ourselves , the more we begin to appreciate that everyone around us is suffering too , and suddenly we are more compassionate with everyone . <p> For many , the most difficult part of living more compassionately is learning to be compassionate with ourselves and trusting that our partners will do the same . How many times have we gotten into a debate about who had a more stressful day at work ? Husbands and wives are not bickering over who has a tougher day because they really think that one of them will win , there 's no prize for having the crappiest day . They are fighting for the right to be comforted . It is as if we believe that only one person can be comforted at a time and we must fight to claim it for ourselves . There are not a limited number of spots for compassion or special criteria you must meet . There is n't a shortage of comforting unless we create one . The unfortunate reality is that suffering is everywhere and with everyone . And just as suffering is in endless supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble is that we are often taught to minimize our problems . We compare our issues to someone elses and feel that we are not worthy of compassion because our problems are n't  that bad . We tell our children , and ourselves , to stop complaining because someone else is worse off than you ? How often do you chastise yourself for feeling upset about your husbands lack of help around the house when you know that your neighbors husband just moved in with his mistress ? This is a common response but it keeps us stuck . When we force ourselves ( and our spouse ) to defend our experience of suffering we build resentment and create a cycle of increasing pain . In order to move forward we must learn to shift from a mentality of shortage to one of abundance . Just as there is an abundance of pain there can be an abundance of love and understanding but we must begin with ourselves . <p> Putting Compassion Into Action Of course there are degrees of suffering . Your frustration with your husbands lack of bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infidelity ; but dismissing your experience as unworthy of compassion sets you and your spouse up for even greater distress . Many times we think that by allowing ourselves to feel upset or sad or hurt by minor issues ( however you choose to define that ) we are being self-indulgent or giving power to these experiences . The truth is that our pain gets its power from our denial or minimization of it . Like a small area of mold in your basement , left untreated our pain only grows and spreads , it will not resolve itself without our attention . When we validate the suffering in our lives , no matter how small or " insignificant " they may seem , we are suddenly able to accept the comfort we so desperately seek and let it go . Moving on means first acknowledging where we are . <p> When you can gently acknowledge that your suffering over the dirty bathrooms is real , you are then able to go deeper and learn to understand more about yourself . Maybe the pain about housework is just a tangible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too busy to take care of you and the house . By being compassionate with yourself first , you can help your husband understand that experience , enabling him to offer comfort to your emotional pain rather than solutions to a physical problem . Hiring a cleaning person to clean bathrooms once a week in not likely to alleviate your sense of abandonment ; however hiring someone and then using that time to go on a date together could give you the comfort you seek , and keep those toilets sparkling . <p> This is where the magic of compassionate living happens , as you learn to be compassionate with yourself , you create a space for your spouse to be more compassionate with you . If you can learn to look at each other with compassion rather than competition , you will find that there is more than enough to go around . And as you learn to stop fighting for comfort your suffering is relieved and you are better able to offer your spouse the compassion that he seeks . And so a new cycle begins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A compassionate marriage is built on the idea that everyone experiences some level of pain everyday and that by honoring that and seeking to really understand it you can grow closer to one another . And together , you can create a life and relationship in which you are able to put empathy into action and love each other more fully . <p> Eshter Boykin is the co-owner/founder of Group Therapy Associates and is a licensed marriage and family therapist in Virginia .

It 's not uncommon for there to be some degree of sexual incompatibility to be worked through in marriage . In fact , it 's part of the adventure . <p> Sexual incompatibility is a normal and natural part of marriage given the different sexual wiring of men and women , and the unique differences and desires of every individual . Sexual incompatibility is the inability of one or both spouses to understand each other sexually , to make some necessary changes , and then work with or adapt to each others differences . <p> This incompatibility often manifests itself in a husband and wifes desires regarding frequency , variety , and the degree of emotional engagement they invest in the sexual relationship . It also affects the level of interest and the importance placed on the sexual dimension of marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminished as couples work through their differences , and together build their intimate relationship . Its not the couples differences , but what they do with them that really matters . <p> Sexual compatibility is a learned behavior ; its something that comes with time , effort and lots of practice within the unique relationship of marriage . Its not something you can " test " for by taking someone for a trial run . Furthermore , a sexual relationship outside of marriage is not an accurate indicator of what the sexual relationship will be within the context of marriage anyway . <p> Marriage is uniquely designed as a relationship of commitmentheart , mind , body and soul . It presupposes total allegiance to each other with all aspirations and dimensions of life interwoven together . Marriage is a surprise grab bag . You never really know what you 're going to get .

Its hard to imagine a greater motivator for couples to develop such characteristics than struggling through sexual incompatibilities . Even though couples may need to expect a learning curve in marriage there is hope that couples can create a mutually fulfilling , passionate and intimately connected relationship . <p> Our job within marriage is to get educated , be willing and able to discuss sexual issues and preferences , and to make some potentially challenging personal adjustments to diminish the sexual incompatibilities often found between a husband and wife . By accepting the fact that some sexual incompatibility may be inevitable in marriage , we can shift our energies from wallowing in it to proactively improving the situation . <p> Its amazing how even one person can shift the dynamics of the relationship when they decide to strengthen this dimension of marriage and engage in more effective interactions with their spouse . Although some sexual incompatibility may be inherent in marriage , I hope couples will be encouraged to take the necessary steps to increase their sexual connection and enjoyment of this vital dimension of marriage .

Is sex addiction a real thing or just a scapegoat for wrongdoings ? Are cheaters just plain selfish , unremorseful , and uncaring about the feelings of their spouse ? <p> To address these questions , I have devised an " Affair Danger Levels " concept to demonstrate how to avoid an affair from the very start , how to predict if your current relationship could suffer from an affair , how to prevent infidelity , heal from or move on from an indiscretion . <p> Affair Danger Levels <p> Level 1 : Low.No marriage is immune from an affair . However , there is a very low likelihood that an affair would ever happen if the relationship is strong , the couple has good self-esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect , good impulse control , and high morals are present .

There is a moderate chance of an affair occurring if an unaddressed lack in the relationship is starting to manifest for one of the partners and if there are unresolved arguments . The potential betrayer could be starting to seek some outside comfort and make emotional connections with others , possibly in the form of e-mails , texting , phone calls , etc. , and may not even be conscious that this behavior could lead to a physical affair . An astute partner could notice the change in behavior and patterns and get proactive in addressing the problem together , before it leads to the actual physical affair . <p> Level 3 : High .

There is a very high probability that an affair will happen if the betrayer is experiencing a lack in the current marriage , has a pattern of past betrayals , is not a good communicator , has low impulse control , and compartmentalizes his/her emotions . The betrayer could have narcissistic tendencies with no regard for the consequences of his/her behavior , or the extreme pain imposed on the victim/partner at the time .

They may try to stop cheating , but without the intervention of an experienced therapist and/or rehabilitation center , all hope for change is lost . <p> For the health of your relationship it is extremely important to be aware of signs of trouble before a full-blown affair occurs .

If that 's the way you have decided to go , familiarize yourself with the rules so you meet the requirements . <p> Another circumstance which may trigger uncertainty is inheritance .

We know instinctively , even before the fanfare of wedding vows , that the hallmark of a committed intimate relationship is sexual exclusivity . In any real life scenario , we also know that we ca n't be with our spouse in every waking moment .

How does this impact the relationship ? While the guilt of an affair can be an exceedingly heavy weight to carry , exposure carries its own set of complications . One of the primary places where the effects of such a confession are felt is the bedroom . Yes , affairs in marriage are always complicated . Whether it was cyber sex , phone sex , physical sex , a one-night stand or an out and out love affair , sexual infidelity has a telling impact on the sex life of the couple who decide to keep their marriage together . <p> The man or woman guilty of infidelity , but still wants the marriage to work , is likely to experience some after-confession discomfort in the bedroom .

After a confession of sexual impropriety , knowing what to expect emotionally and sexually is perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your individual scenario . In addition to the tips below , professional counseling is also recommended . <p> Tips on Reconnecting if You Have Been an Unfaithful Spouse <p> So you 've done the unthinkable in being unfaithful , but to your credit you have bitten the bullet and confessed . How do you pursue your partner sexually after such a major and life-altering foul up ? There is obviously no carte blanche response and it is likely that behaviors may vary between men and women . Nonetheless , these general principles should guide both sexes with respect to their attempts to salvage their marriage and by extension their sex lives . <p> Waiting it out : If you 're the guilty party , it may be important to communicate that while you still want to connect sexually , you are willing to wait for as long as your partner needs to feel emotionally ready to resume intimacy . This communicates genuine remorse and a willingness to be selfless ; something that was clearly not shown during your acts of indiscretion . <p> Talking it over : Understand that the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions which delve for sexual details . It is likely that the victim of infidelity will be consumed by a need to know incidents and details of time and place . Curiosity may also be extended to the nature of sex acts participated in . This time can be made easier by not erecting further barriers but by answering questions as honestly as possible . <p> Sensitivity in the sack : Most likely , your partner will be consumed with thoughts of the other man or woman . It is imperative that you go slow , when the time for lovemaking comes or at least take the lead or cue from your partner who has been hurt . This sensitivity should include lots of verbal affirmations which are personal , intimate and loving . Be sure to let your partner know why you married them , how much they are loved and how much you appreciate their staying in the relationship . Affirm your partners beauty or brawn and use loads of eye contact which confirm how truly sorry you are . Avoiding this sensitive time by acting as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have not yet come to terms with your own personal failing . <p> Maximising the moments : Sex with your spouse after confessing an affair is likely to be more about emotional and spiritual re-bonding than about the quality of an orgasm . Use this time , nonetheless , to cement your reconnection by focusing on your spouses pleasure . The vulnerability that occurs , because everything is out in the open , can actually increase the intensity of passion . Most infidels , after confession , can not believe how they " messed up " and almost ruined it all ; this awareness and sensitivity to what was almost completely lost can actually strengthen the emotional bond between the couple , which can then result in a dynamic sexual connection . <p> Tips on Reconnecting if Your Spouse Has Cheated <p> So you 've been cheated on and its finally in the open . You have not , however , walked out on the marriage or sought revenge in the arms of another . Youve decided to make your marriage work . How can you navigate this ultra-vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy sex again with the person who has caused you so much pain . The following ideas might help you through this difficult time . <p> Admit your pain : There is no greater disservice you can do to your marriage then to attempt to trivialize the impact of an affair or to down-play it . It is imperative that you articulate your disappointment and hurt . This may involve screaming , crying , throwing things , journaling , talking to a counselor or even moving out of the bedroom for a while . ( Yes , this also applies to husbands ) . Admittedly , because men are often socialized to hide emotion , this can be particularly challenging for a man who may just choose to clam up . If you are to experience great sex again without feeling victimized , sharing the depth of your pain with your spouse is critical . <p> Focus on you : There is a huge temptation after being cheated on to blame yourselfyour lack of attractiveness , lack of sexiness and the like . This is particularly true of women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach inside yourself to find the worthwhile , sensual woman who deserves to be loved despite your spouses act of indiscretion . For husbands , as well , images of your wife making love to another man can be disconcerting to say the least . It is critical , therefore , to disassociate yourself sexually from what your spouse did and to refuse to accept blame . It is not your fault that your partner was or is weak and lacked discipline . This will mean deliberately not dwelling on the images that will come to your mind . <p> Resist the temptation to compare : Wondering if you are better in bed than your spouses lover is likely to be an obsessive thought , but it is actually counter-productive . Studies consistently show that many have affairs while still having great or adequate sex at home . The motivation for an affair usually has little to do with dissatisfaction with married sex and tends more to be linked to life challenges , transitions , depression , a weak moment or feelings of inadequacy . When these thoughts come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your love life even better . Dwell on the fact that since you and your spouse have decided to stay together , this must mean something in terms of how you feel about one another . <p> Redefine to reconnect : The emotions experienced after your spouse has confessed an affair can be described in terms of grief and loss . You are likely to feel an overwhelming sadness because your relationship is not what you thought it was . There is admittedly a sense in which your relationship can never be the same again . This is expected and must be embraced as inevitable . If you , your marriage and your sex life are to survive this juncture , it is critical that you seek to redefine your marriage . This involves acceptance of the affair ( not approval ) as an event of the past which can not be altered . This process is , of course , a lot easier if your spouse cooperates in these efforts . Your spouses cooperation should involve total openness and honesty as well as accountability with respect to whereabouts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no lies and absolutely no attempts at deceit . When these conditions are met , the process of charting a new course for your relationship will be a whole lot easier . These factors are also necessary for the process of healing and mutual forgiveness to begin .

@@79604816 @1104816/ <p> Marriage and Grad School : Tips to Help Make it ThroughWhat to know and prepare for when your spouse is attending graduate school.BY MONYA DE , MD MPH <p> BigStockPhoto Even though one person is taking the classes , you are both experiencing the effects of grad school . <p> " The more the other students get to know you as a person , the less ' available ' your attractive spouse will seem . " <p> As a couple , you 're ecstatic . One of you slogged through exam preparation , endless essays , formidable forms and now there 's finally an acceptance letter in the mail . But what should you anticipate when one of you is starting graduate school ? Beginning work on a new degree can have a significant impact on your marriage . <p> Obviously , the seismic impact of graduate school depends somewhat on the nature of your spouses program , and some factors are unique to different situations . However , here are six areas to pay close attention to while your husband or wife is earning their advanced degree . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse will become a precious commodity no matter what kind of school he or she is attending . After spending much of the day in lecture , your spouse will be expected to hit the books , project meetings , or the lab . Those nights catching up luxuriously on five episodes of " Modern Family " will be the first to go . To make matters more frustrating , your spouse might have chunks of free time during the day when you 're tied up at work . <p> Its important not to put pressure on your spouse , who has plenty to get stressed out about , to give you the kind of couple time you had before . It simply is n't going to happen . Rather , at the beginning of the term , schedule a date night that happens at the same time ( ideally ) each week . Date night might consist of macaroni and cheese , bad Merlot and venting about your day together ; or it might be a romantic jaunt on the town . What matters is that you 've asserted the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torts lecture . <p> Relationship Drainers <p> Medical and law school probably have the worst reputations for monopolizing spouses , but do n't  underestimate PhD and MBA programs . MBAs are under pressure to show up at a staggering number of happy hours and social events because they have a short two years to establish the networks that will support their entire careers . They also spend a lot of time in massively inefficient project meetings with classmates of varying levels of intelligence , commitment and sobriety . PhD ( and even some masters ) theses have a tendency to grow into massive , untamable monsters . Lab experiments fail and require redos that find hapless future biologists and chemists pulling all-nighters to avoid getting crucified by their PIs ( principal investigators , or the people who take credit for your spouses work ) . <p> You might feel less able to relate to your grad-student spouse . Some students come home and want to talk about anything but ion channels or criminal law , but others simply will not shut up about the dead fetus in anatomy lab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient , and see it as an opportunity to gauge the professional interests of your spouse . Some day , bewildered at a career crossroads , you 'll be able to remind your spouse , " You loved learning about X in grad school , remember ? " Remember , too , that your career and activities are important , and make an effort to bring stories and comments on the table to keep things on equal footing . <p> Dealing with Finances <p> Finances are a major concern for a couple pursuing higher education in any way . ( This topic is an article in itself , and for a start I would recommend the book " Debt Free U " by Zac Bissonnette ) . Unless your wife or husband has scored a full-ride scholarship , things are probably going to be tight . Budget , budget , budget . Do not take out more loans than are necessary . The exception to this is , let 's say you can get a crazy-low interest rate on a school loan and lock the interest rate inwell , youve just outsmarted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid higher interest rates on car and home loans . You use the extra cash from the loan to pay for things you need ( emphasis on need ) . I am only talking about federal loans here , by the way . If you have time after work , you can be a huge help to your spouse ( and a great money-saver ) by packing lunches for your dearest to avoid expensive trips to the campus sandwich shop . <p> Sleep Deprivation and Sex <p> Be prepared for rather impressive levels of fatigue in your spouse . All-nighters , 30-hour hospital shifts , and the like take a massive toll . Do n't  take it personally if she walks in the room still wearing scrubs and falls asleep drooling on your arm 30 seconds later , or gets weirdly possessive about sleep . On the flip side , if your spouse rising at 3 a.m. to go to the hospital is messing up your sleep and work performance , its not illegal to sleep separately a couple of nights a week . Rest is important for immunity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sex , this one tends to go out the window for non-proactive couples . Do something about it and bend to her schedule . If you notice your spouse is most grumpy in the morning before leaving for class , suggest intimate activities in the evening . Surprise romantic gestures are hit or miss for someone with a midterm in two days , so do n't  expect your wife to be swept off her feet and toss her study papers aside . Better to plan your time together and schedule it at strategic times ( after-exam date , romantic reward for getting through 100 practice questions , etc . ) . You can almost create a Pavlovian response ; your spouse will look forward to these moments and associate her academic accomplishments with affection immediately to follow . A win-win situation . <p> Dealing with New " Friends " <p> Finally , the power of the social bubble of graduate school absolutely can not be overstated . You 're talking about a group of young or youngish people who are all smart , excited about the same thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a perfect setting for lust . As the spouse , you should be aware that it is very , very , very common for long-term relationships to break up when the graduate student gets carried away and makes " study dates " into something more . Once , I begged a friend whose longtime girlfriend was off to medical school to propose to her . He decided to wait a few months , and before he knew what was happening , he was single . <p> Tips for the Long Haul <p> Following the guidelines above is a start to preserving the value of your marriage . You should also make an effort to enter the social bubble . Attending the school Christmas party or after-exam keg party is like marking your territory . The more the other students get to know you as a person , the less ' available ' your attractive spouse will seem . They need to see you as a happy couple , as frequently as possible . <p> If possible , you can also go to the campus and visit your spouse between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time together in the daytime and in her environment , as opposed to only at night when she 's an exhausted heap . Face it , your shabby little apartment pales in comparison to the rich social life and intellectual stimulation of graduate school , and its important to integrate yourself in every part of your spouses life so that she does n't  unconsciously associate you with dirty dishes and being exhausted . <p> Knowing the worst-case scenario can prepare you for making a better situation for your spouse 's time in graduate school . The years can be fun and full of discovery and accomplishment . Be there for awards ceremonies , provide hugs when things do n't go well , and make efforts to understand the dynamics and pressures in the graduate program . At the same time , ensure that you have time together when you 've got each other 's full attention ( and are both fully awake ) . That balance will keep your marriage healthy and happy . <p> Monya De , MD MPH is a physician in Los Angeles . She has contributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay Express , the New Physician , and more .

@@79604822 @1104822/ <p> Control Battles In Your RelationshipHow do you and your partner deal with the " Big 6 ? " BY STACY PHILLIPS <p> BigStockPhoto Do n't let control ruin your relationship , find balance . <p> Relationships are not easy . Not one of them can work without some give and take . If you are in a committed relationship and having problems with that relationship , perhaps you have not come to grips yet with why that is so . Chances are , the two of you are engaged in control battles over one or more of the " Big Six . " When relationships get into trouble it is almost always due to control being an issue or at issue . Fighting for control in one department or another in the Big Six is what always causes friction andif not dealt with appropriatelydiscord that can lead to a breakup . Many breakups can be avoided , though , if only more couples would work out their control issues . <p> What comprises the Big Six ? They are basic categories or areas where control is , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas include : <p> Control Is a Tricky Thing What you should know is that control can be good , bad or more often in between . There is no standard by which it can be measured . Sometimes control is a detriment when a person uses it to coerce , be it aggressively or passively ; sometimes it is good when used appropriately ; and other times it can be a toss up . The reality is control is prevalent in any relationship . And when couples are jockeying for control as opposed to sharing control , it always becomes a contest . Why ? By nature , people are typically competitive . <p> So then , you can probably see , without exception , when a relationship is strained , someone is invariably in control in one or more of these six departments , while the other is out of control . Or , quite often , a couple is in a tug o war vying for control in one or more of these six areas . <p> Let me take a moment to talk about when control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the three dynamics has to be in place : either one party is designated as the " Controller " and the other the " Controllee " the dominate and the submissiveand they enjoy their respective " roles , " or both have an understanding as to who will control what ( like he handles the money , and she has the last word on rearing the children ) . Or in the idyllic relationshipmy value judgmentboth are equal partners , sharing in decisions and authority somewhat evenly . This is rather rare though ; for where there are couples , there are differences . So , if control is not bothersome , a relationship can stay together , unscathed ; but once control becomes an irritant or a big deal the relationship falters . <p> More on controlit is fickle . Each couples circumstances and relationship can evolve and change , often dramatically over time . This is especially true where any or all of the Big Six are involved . So naturally then , the balance of power in the relationship can also evolve and change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more baffling is that two people can have control at the same time , but over different issues . That , too , can change . True it can provide a status quo as it transforms , but it can just as easily and suddenly shift and shuffle , sometimes causing total chaos . <p> Where in the Big Six Are You ? Just where do you stand in the control department with your partner in relation to the Big Six ? To find out , you first need to identify whether you are the " Shot-Caller " ( Controller ) or the " Controllee " in each of the Big Six . <p> Here are four tasks you can undertake to make that determination : <p> 1 . Identify where you are in terms of control in the geography of the Big Six ( Do you decide which investments to make while your significant other gets to call the shots with regard to how often you have sex ? ) . 2 . Pinpoint who or what is in control ( Has a recent illness caused you to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively putting the illness in the control seat ? ) . 3 . Evaluate whether or not you want or need control in each of the categories of concern ( Can you give up your insistence as to what religious organization to support if your partner suddenly announces he/she has decided she/he has grown in a different spiritual direction ? ) . 4 . Pave the way to introduce opportunities that will aid you in reclaiming , asserting , or relinquishing control ( Might that require a face-to-face meeting with your mate to express your control struggles and your preferences ? This allows you to negotiate or delineate some control boundaries ) . <p> Important to Remember Ironically , when we acquiesce to our significant other , and give him/her controlgive instead of take , or follow instead of leadwe are far more in control than when we attempt to be the " Controller " much of the time . ( Beware : Those who feel the need to always control are effectively out of control ! ) That is not to say that you should not assert control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self , that will work to your detriment so decide what you can give up to get and what you have to stand fast on . You do n't  want to lose yourself in this delicate process . That is one of the biggest mistakes many couples make . <p> The ultimate goal is to attempt to keep the control in the relationshipbetween the two of youat parity . When control is lopsided , you can be relatively certain the relationship will eventually hit the wall . You can not be the " Shot-Caller " in all things . Think about the Big Six and decide where you stand : Are you the " Shot-Caller " or the Controllee ? Of the Big Six where you play either role , are you comfortable with your " control " arrangement ? Again , strive for balance . And , if control issues are causing turmoil in your relationship , do something about them . Relationships that workwhere both parties feel wholealways call for open communication because only then can you come to resolution and agreement with regard to control issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and author of " Divorce : Its All About ControlHow to Win the Emotional , Psychological and Legal Wars .

I taught classes on the negative effects of airbrushing , and the degree of eating disorders in the modeling industry , and I taught about the excessive pursuit of the male stereotype in body builders . I had believed that we would educate our kids and ourselves about how to feel better from the inside out , but instead , the problems have become worse , in some ways , and not only do young women have to look fit and thin , but even older women are still focused on the same pursuit of physical perfection at the cost of their self-esteem .

Why ? Males have higher rates in 12 of the 15 leading causes of death . Forget the old joke that a married man wants to die . According to a new study of roughly 1,000 middle-age men who graduated from Wisconsin high schools in 1957 presented at a meeting of the American Sociological Association in San Francisco , the reason he dies first is because of the " ideals " of masculinity . The more manly he feels , the less likely he is to seek preventative medical care . Then oops its too late . <p> A manly man sucks up the pain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unable to hide his fear . He stands at the top of the hierarchy , and we all know that leaders do not tremble with white coat hypertension or fail their stress tests .

For example , if he likes red meat , grill a lean cut and position it between two slices of multi-grain bread . Then stealthily add some vegetables like roasted peppers , arugula , tomato and onions . If you use cheese , get a low-fat version . Disguise the fruits , veggies and aim for a rainbow array .

Nor do you have to drive to both parents houses every Thanksgiving just because they live in the same town . You and your spouse have the right to decide where and with whom to spend the holidays .

( Seattle ) <p> Its unfortunate that your happy news was n't initially met with support and happiness , but there is a good chance that your husband will come around very soon ! <p> When couples discuss and plan for children , most of the process occurs on a cognitive level rather than an emotional level . For men and women alike , the idea of having a child can feel like a rational decision that can be scheduled to fit in with overall life plans . <p> However , once a pregnancy is confirmed , the news can affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated . Everyone responds differently , but it is not uncommon for the news of the pregnancy to send one or both of the parents-to-be into shock . Especially when the pregnancy is planned , women often handle the news with relative ease . After all , the fetus is in the womans body and the emotional connection can be nearly instantaneous . The primal sense of motherhood can melt away a womans initial concerns about the more practical matters of parenthood . However , men are in a different place physically and psychologically . Some men reel from the news and have difficulty adjusting to the idea that , several months down the road , life will change forever . As the reality of the pregnancy hits home , a man can worry about how the coming baby might affect everything from work schedules to a fulfilling sex life . <p> Men can become anxious about impending fatherhood for many practical reasons , not the least of which is the huge financial and emotional responsibility of fathering a child .

All of these thoughts , and so many more , may be racing through your husbands mind .

Both of these changes are major life stressors of their own . It is likely that both you and your husband are still becoming acclimated to the new surroundings and a new way of life . <p> Not having family or friends nearby is surely an added stress and leaves you both without much external support . As your husband is still adjusting to his new job and the many changes that come with moving , it is not surprising that he is having difficulty adjusting to the news . Finding that he is to be a father one year ahead of schedule could surely contribute to your husbands concerns ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new responsibility . <p> The good news is that your husband will most likely come around with a bit of patience and support . Continue to have gentle , open , and honest communication with him . Make special time to show him that you are still his wife , his lover , and his friend . Consistently take part in couples activities that do n't  specifically relate to the pregnancy . For example , invite him to take walks with you after work , enjoy romantic dinners together , and play as a couple as much as possible . By keeping the focus on your loving relationship , your husband may warm up to the idea of fatherhood more quickly . <p> The overall idea is to support your husband really welcoming the pregnancy . He may simply need a bit of time to get used to the idea of fatherhood . Without pressuring him , consistently invite your husband to doctors appointments and make clear note of them on a calendar where he can see the appointment times . Place a book on fatherhood in a strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work invite him for a night out , encourage him to go .

PENNINGTON <p> TLC Dr. Robi Ludwig <p> MARRIAGE STATSSpouse : David LudwigMarried : 13 yearsKids : 2Notable : Psychotherapist Dr. Robi Ludwig has shared her insight on issues pertaining to lifestyle and love as a regular on NBCs " The Today Show , " Larry King Live , Nancy Grace and Court TV , where topics can get a little more grim when she 's explaining the criminal mind . Now she 's the host of her own show , TLCs " One Week to Save Your Marriage . " Already airing Mondays at 10 PM ET/PT on TLC through August 28th , Dr. Ludwig gives some intensive care each week to couples making their final attempt to salvage their union as they face the real possibility of divorce . The show has already been picked for a second season and will return in 2007 , but in the meantime , Dr. Ludwig gives us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most common problem issue you see couples deal with ? The most common problem I see couples deal with is partner disappointment . It might be disappointment over in-law issues , financial realities , and/or other flaws that rear its ugly head during marriage . We all end up with flawed partners , yet somehow this very common reality is overlooked during the courting phase and/or on our wedding day . I once came across a pillow that said , " Love is blind , but marriage is an eye opener " is n't that the truth ? <p> 2 You are a psychotherapist , but you 're also married with children . How much of the advice you give on the show is based on your own experience or common sense , and how much is more from your expertise ? The advice I give is influenced by all three factors . All three are important , and in a way ca n't be separated from one another . I understand from an experiential standpoint the challenges of being a wife and mother . But its important not to confuse ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I work with . That 's why its so important to receive training . You learn how to make those important separations , so you can be objective in a way that 's beneficial for the couples you see in treatment . <p> 3 Are there any current factors that are presenting challenges to married couples that perhaps older , more established spouses did n't  have to contend with in the past ? The economics of marriage have changed significantly over the last thirty years . In most cases you have dual income families . If you compare todays marriages with historical marriages there are huge differences . Today , marriage is a union based on love and the concept of having a " soul mate " . Historically , marriages were more business or practical arrangements . Today we place a lot of expectations on our marriagesfor better or for worse . We want our partner to be everything and when they 're not , divorce can be viewed as the only real pathway to happiness . <p> 4 Seeing these couples on the brink of divorce , what has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have worked with who end up saving their marriage , they enter into treatment with the goal to do just thatsave their marriage . It might sound simplistic , but its really very true . Sometimes couples go to counseling with the goal to break up . You could be the best therapist in the world and have no impact with those couples . <p> 5 What has this show taught you about marriage that maybe you did n't  realize before ? Good question " One Week to Save Your Marriage " has reminded me that being happily married is a skill . Fortunately for couples , its a skill that can be learned ! <p> 6 What are some things you and your husband still have to remind yourselves to do or not do in your marriage ? My husband and I are still learning how to talk about money . I spend like I wont have to pay bills , and David is my voice of reason . He saves us from financial ruin . I do n't  always like that conversation : " What 's this on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " but I know its one that has to be had . That only took me 13 years to realize . Hey , we all have resistances ! <p> 7 If you could give one piece of advice for couples out there , what would you say ? Everybody gets a flawed spouse . We need to remember our own imperfections and stop blaming and punishing each other for the inherent disappointments that are unavoidable in marriage . Be kind ! If we want a good relationship , then we have to decide what we want our relationship to look like and then work towards it . Marriage is a creative and ever changing adventure . Its one that requires time , attention and commitment .

My sister has two little children , so that is very sad to me , but even when I suggest coming to visit across the country to see them she is less than enthusiastic and never initiates the topic .

Please help ! <p> Dr. Karen Shermans Reply : <p> First , let me express my gratitude for your courage in expressing this concern .

And , at this time of year when there are many celebrations that tend to be spent with ones family , your loss is going to feel even more pronounced . <p> Let me say straight out that everyone wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of security .

You can not force people to have interactions with you if they do not want to . I notice that you say that both you and your husband moved out at an early age in order to cope with estranged families who had lots of issues . Clearly , this is a long-standing problem on the part of your family members , and it does n't  seem that they are addressing them . Unfortunately , therefore , there is no reason to think that they will change . <p> Given all the information you have provided , here are some suggestions I can make : <p> 1 . You can choose to still act in loving ways to them , e.g. acknowledge events or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are limited and do not expect anything from them . <p> 2 .

You might also create some family by getting involved in senior citizen assisted living facilities . Many of the residents would be very happy to have " family " who care . <p> 5 . Start to extend your network of friends . Social support is very important , and though you do not have a large circle of pals now , you can make the choice to join into activities that will broaden your network . <p> I 'm sure you 've heard the old saying , " You cant pick your family , but you can pick your friends .

A lack of lubrication can pull the skin of the penis in uncomfortable ways during sexual activity . If you 've never used a lubricant before , I recommend trying a water-based one that is pH balanced ; these typically do n't  contain any irritants and are designed to feel like a womans natural moisture . <p> If its a pain that he is only feeling while you 're on top , you might also want to try a new position in which he is on top or behind .

One of the biggest problems in a marriage is the fact that couples do not prioritize it .

Even if this is your personal issue , your husband can be supportive in helping you in not exasperating it . There are things he can do to help reassure youperhaps not take as many trips , shorten the length of his trip , or call you frequently while he is gone . <p> Part of a solid foundation in a partnership is based on mutual respect .

Ask if the two of you might try to come up with some ideas so that both of you will feel like your needs are being met . <p> Though you probably would prefer that your spouse not go at all , part of working at a marriage is learning how to understand one anothers needs and how to compromise .

Their vulnerability makes them more attractive because they are exploitable . <p> Excessive Pleasing This man is catering , nurturing and kind . He never starts a fight .

How do I let him know that I 'm not his personal banker and that my funds are for my family , not his ? <p> Developing strong a relationship with your in-laws is a vital part of a happy and healthy marriage , and part of your relationship with your in-laws is give and take . Of course , theyll always expect to be treated with a modicum of respect that they may , or may not , deserve . But let 's face it , when you picked their child out of all the other possible life partners , they felt that gave them bragging rights and the right to expect your respect . <p> But when an in-law regularly starts to take more than give its time to rethink the relationship . Before we assume that you 're just being used for your financial resources , though , try to figure out exactly what the problem is . Some people borrow money because they 're not organized enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to the bank to get more . People like this are not only disorganized about their own finances , they 're disorganized about their debts . In these cases , they might just " forget " they owe you money in the same way they " forget " that they have to go to the ATM that morning . The best way to pin your dad-in-law down is to remind him that he owes you money . Common sense , yes , but many people feel rude asking for money back . Disorganized people need prompting , and do n't  take offense . Often they are grateful from the reminder . <p> Another possibility is that your father-in-law is genuinely poor and that he s not so much taking advantage of you , but surviving off of your few dollars . If he had made a few too many bad investments or his home is about to be foreclosed then he may just be getting by and reaching out to you for charity . That 's probably not the case , but if so , it may help you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash . Then , of course , you and your spouse can choose whether you want to be his personal welfare agency . <p> If you 've ruled out any better explanations for his behavior or even if you 've ruled them in , you may decide that you 're not interested in scraping the insides of your pocketbook at his request . You can go about solving this problem in a number of ways . Here are some approaches to consider : <p> Turn the tables : Regularly ask your father-in-law for money until he can " feel your pain " and realize how annoying such behavior can be . <p> Empty your pockets : Another way is to simply arrive for a day out without any money , and , when he asks , say you do n't  have any . <p> Make a comfort zone : Alternatively , you can have all the money you desire in your wallet and when he asks , simply say that you 're not comfortable with loaning out money because you fear that such financial exchanges put a strain on your relationship and youd both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The best way of solving this problem would be to sit down with your father-in-law even before he asks for money , describe how the current situation makes you feel and inform him that you plan to stop . If he truly cares about you and your spouse , hell understand and learn his lesson . If not , then , it may put some very necessary distance between you . <p> In all cases , do n't  take on this problem in a vacuum . Sit with your spouse and discuss how you see the problem and find out how she sees the situation . If you present a united front in dealing with your father-in-law , then you 'll be able to support each other whatever the outcome ! 
@@79604854 @1104854/ <p> MARRIAGE STATSMarried : 1 yearKids : 0Notable : Hasty is the founder and chocolatier of Beverly Hills chocolate boutique Madame Chocolat ( www.madame-chocolat.com ) , which was recently featured on E ! Entertainments , " The Girls Next Door . " She is married to celebrity pastry chef and chocolatier Jacques Torres ( www.jacquestorres.com ) who was her mentor , chef and boss while in training . Jacques owns two chocolate shops in New York City , has authored two cookbooks and has hosted multiple Food Network shows . <p> 1 How did Jacques propose to you , and did it involve chocolate ? He actually proposed right here in the ( Madame Chocolat ) chocolate factory . It was very fitting since we met because of chocolate and we fell in love because of chocolate , but its ironic that chocolate is the one thing that keeps us apart . <p> We were both working late in the factory and he slipped the ring into a bowl of hot water . He asked me to get a scraper out of the bowl , but when I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him it was too hot and tried to offer him a different scraper , but he kept saying that he needed that particular one . I told him again I could n't get it because the water was so hot , so he put his hand in the water and his face turned bright red . He said , " It is really hot ! " <p> He pulled the ring out and said something like , " Will you really have me , " or " Can you really be with me ? " and I was just speechless . I started crying and shaking and moving away from him . I was in total shock . Then he tried to put the ring on my finger but it got stuck on my knuckle , and through my tears , I remember yelling , " Push harder ! " <p> 2 Why did you decide to open your own shop instead of going into business with Jacques ? For years , my dream was to open Madame Chocolat in LA . I went to USC and got a business degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn chocolate into a career . I went to New York to study with Jacques , and I had to commit to living there for at least a year . At the end of that year I felt like I was ready to go back to LA and open my shop , and I only started dating Jacques the last two or three months I was in New York . <p> When I came back to LA , it took me nine months to find my location and nine months to build and open the store . It opened in November 2006 . We had a long-distance , bicoastal relationship throughout all that time . Never in a million years did I think I 'd marry Jacques Torres . <p> Today , looking back , it would make sense to do something together , but right now I 'm in LA and I ca n't move because my business is so new , and he s 1,000 times busier in New York so he ca n't move either . We just try to see each other as much as we can . <p> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually ? Yes . Were hoping to try to get pregnant in 2009 . There 's a significant age difference between usIm 33 and he s 49and we both love kids . We really wish we had them yesterday . Were still figuring out how to make it all work , but sometimes we joke about just opening a store right in the middle of the country . <p> 4 What 's your favorite one of Jacques chocolates , and what 's his favorite one of yours ? There are so many categories , I do n't  know where to begin , but for bonbons my favorites are his European peanut butter , which is totally made from scratch , and his new apple pie one , which has a pie crust on the outside . Another favorite is his dark chocolate truffle with cocoa bits . <p> As for my chocolates , I think he really loves my bonbons . I think he thinks they 're pretty , like pieces of jewelry , and his favorite ones are the Champagne kiss and the lady bugs . He also really likes my caramel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not chocolate ? Jacques loves to go fishing . He has a boat , and when I 'm not in New York , he actually stays on it . When I 'm there , we stay in the apartment . So we eat a lot of fresh seafood and paella . He has Spanish blood in him and I 'm Persian , and were really influenced by our backgrounds so we use a lot of saffron and basmati rice . We also love being healthy and eat a lot of fresh salads . <p> And we love going out to eat . One of the perks of being married to a celebrity chef is that all of his friends are celebrity chefs and they all own amazing restaurants . <p> 6 After being featured on " The Girls Next Door , " helping the girls make some body-part molded birthday gifts for Hugh Hefner , have you been receiving more risquT chocolate requests ? Yes . A lot of women are asking for the body parts and most of the requests are coming from the Midwest area . Hardly any are coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  local since we have to do the molding on site . <p> 7 In the future , do you dream about starring in a your own TV show with Jacques ? Jacques is working on his own show right now , which is supposed to be on PBS . His producer will eventually have me on as a guest , but its definitely the Jacques Torres chocolate show . In LA , I 've been asked to do a few things , and of course I always say yes . The opportunity for us to do something together has n't  come yet , but of course we would love to do something . We work so well together , were energetic and we make each other laugh a lot . It would be fun . 
@@79604855 @1104855/ <p> Whether you have been married two months or 12 years , sooner or later an " ex " boy/girlfriend or spouse situation is bound to arise . The manner in which you handle yourself will play a vital part in the success and happiness that you currently enjoy with your spouse . <p> Ive put together a quick Q &amp; A on how to handle a number of situations that might arise or are sometimes unavoidable if the ex comes into play . <p> The main thing your husband should want to consider is your feelings . While a handshake may seem stiff or informal , a cheery , " Hi , how are you " might be a good alternative to a hug . On the other hand , ask yourself how long they were married , are there children involved and what is the overall relationship the ex has with your family , including yourself . <p> 2 . Be kinder to the ex . " At every family gathering , my husband 's entire clan treats his ex wife better than they treat me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? " <p> It 's understandable that you may feel a bit uncomfortable and , depending on the degree of their attention , you are justified to feel somewhat hurt . However , saying something to your husband 's ex is not the answer . You can mention it to your husband without sounding like you 're angry or jealous by saying , " When I see the attention that Jolie gets from your mom , I feel a little sad . I hope we can develop a similar relationship over time . " You can say the same thing to his mother . If your tone is not condescending or defensive , it could be the start of a closer relationship between you and his family . <p> 3 . Ask for what you want . " Every time I walk into a room I find my family talking to my husband about my past life with my ex . It really upsets me . " <p> State your request clearly but firmly to your family by saying , " I am happily married and have moved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations could concentrate on the present rather than bringing up parts of my life that I would prefer left alone . " <p> 4 . Make no mistake that young children 's needs should come first . " My wife spends most of her evening working with her kids from her previous marriage and it leaves little time for us . Her ex also does n't step up and do their share and it sucks up all her time . " <p> Schedule a date or stay up later , do whatever it takes to work on your marriage , but understand that your wife is also a mother , and young children are not self-sufficient . It 's important to respect a wife that gives up some of her time to ensure her kids needs are met . I am sure your needs are second and I bet her needs are probably last . Plan something special , get your in-laws involved and whisk your wife away for an afternoon , an evening or a weekend without the children. ? <p> 5 . Photographs and memories . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my spouse 's previous marriage . Although it is in a drawer , I do n't understand why he insists on keeping it . " <p> There could be several reasons , among them a keepsake for his kids , a reminder of his friends and family at that point in his life , or it may even bring back fond memories . As long as it is not sitting front and center on your coffee table , I would n't worry too much about it and spend your time concentrating on making photo memories together of your own . <p> 6 . The exs mother is still involved . " How can I tell my ex mother in-law to stay out of my business ? " <p> If it concerns her grandchildren , good luck . If she is just being meddlesome , simply tell her that you are a grown woman ( or man ) and that you appreciate her concern but you are perfectly capable of making decisions without her input or advice . She may or may not adhere to your request , but you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject or simply not answering the phone next time she calls . If you stick to your guns long enough you may be able to curtail her uninvited advice . <p> 7 . An ex 's disrespect . " Every time my stepchildren come over they tell me how their mother always tells them lies about my husband and myself . I have tried to tell them that she is just a liar but they do n't believe me . " <p> They never will . You are not the informer , and it is best to let your husband deal with his ex-wife . If he chooses not to do so , heed his lead and do the same . The children will grow up and make their own decisions based on what they see coming from you and your husband . His ex-wife may have control now , but not forever . As they mature , the truth will come out , one way or the other . <p> 8 . Comparing ex 's . " My wife always compares me to her ex-husband , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and makes more money . " <p> Well , you must be doing something better because she is married to you and not him ! Seriously , let your wife know how her comments make you feel . Eventually , she will find other things to compare you to and you may be the winner this time . <p> 9 . Details , details . " How much do I have to share with my wife about my multiple past relationships with my previous mates . She is constantly bugging me for details . " <p> Have you given her a reason to bug you ? She may be feeling insecure or she may just be inquisitive . Either way , you owe her a certain amount of respect to answer her honestly to a certain degree . However , you are not obligated to go into every tiny detail ( you may not even remember every detail ) unless it can affect her physical or emotional health and well-being . On the other hand , if you feel the need to be vague about even the simplest inquiry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , if your wife is asking you all of these questions now and it is affecting your relationship , why were n't these issues a factor during the dating phase ? Also , if something has happened recently to make her feel insecure , getting to the bottom of it is important and you may consider couples ' counseling or other professional help . <p> 10 . Dinner , dancing and the ex . " Is it weird that my wife wants to socialize with her ex-husband and his new wife ? It does n't bother me , but our friends think it 's crazy . " <p> Do you care what your friends think , really ? I would be more inclined to use my own instincts and good judgment when determining if socializing with your wife 's ex is weird . I know many couples , myself included , that have wonderful relationships with their ex and new spouse and it should be scrutinized case by case . If anyone of the players is uncomfortable , the deal should be off in consideration for their feelings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with forgiving and moving on . 113805 @qwx733805

JONI FRATER &amp; ESTHER LASTIQUE <p> DepositPhotos Growing old together means you 'll have to tackle health issues when they come alongcommunication is key to overcoming challenges . <p> Can a man feeling sexually inadequate go silent for months ? I ca n't figure this out . My husband stopped talking to me four months agono response to my advances , no sex whatsoever . He avoids eye contact and , when sleeping , he faces the other way . He wo n't tell me what 's wrong . He used to be fun and charismatic , but his sex drive went down after his prostate gland was removed surgically . Even still , it was all good up until four months ago . I am so confused . We are both in our forties . Please help ! <p> As sexologists , we can only offer our opinion on the issues you 've presented here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you had the courage to come forth and share your story , as this is something that affects many married couples . We believe that at age 40 , you should be having sex several times a week . Personally , we have found many reasons that you should have orgasmic sex every 24-36 hours for physical health , including helping with prostate issues . <p> What you 've asked actually encompasses several issues that must be addressed simultaneously . However , we believe the primary issues are : <p> * Communication . <p> * Medical issues and working as a team with your physician . <p> * How to reconnect sexually . <p> First , let 's talk about communication . <p> One of the amazing things about our culture is that we are surrounded and inundated with media images of sexuality , yet most of us still have a huge problem talking about sex . The question above presents , at its core , what troubles us all : somethings wrong and one or both of us do n't  want to talk about it . Silence can kill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room " issue is to fester and grow , and it can result in a rift so deep and wide that one day it may separate you permanently . Its uncomfortable to address it , but its important to remember that the discomfort is temporary and its time to face the fear and do it anyway . <p> There are a possible host of reasons behind his silence . After prostate surgery , many men may worry about : <p> * Sexual inadequacy . <p> * Continued medical issues , including a foreboding concern over mortality . <p> * Rejection from their partner if they cant perform the way they used to . <p> Overcoming his resistance to talking about what is behind his withdrawal is vital to discovering what the true problem is and how to overcome it . <p> We know that is easier said than done . A plan of action is required to get everyone on the same page and to open up your lines of communication . The first thing you need to do as the concerned , shut out spouse is to express how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to take place in a completely non-sexual situation , like over a cup of coffee or a glass of wine . <p> Communicate to your spouse that you are concerned about the fact you have n't been sexual since the surgery . Have you told him that you miss being physical , including non-sexual physical affection like hugging and massage ? Tell him now . Explain to him that you are also concerned about his health , and that you have noticed the changes in behavior that you mentioned in your question ( not initiating sex , turning away from you , etc. ) and that you are worried these behaviors may be symptoms of larger health concerns . <p> To determine whether his lack of sexual interest and willingness is related to a medical issue , you have to talk about it . That may take a little pressure off of him if his silence reflects a fear of inadequacy , not a medical concern . Explain to him that being sexual is a very important part of your marriage and that you are willing to do whatever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you would like to set up an appointment to go to his prostate doctor together to talk about the progress and resume sexual activity . <p> Once you become comfortable talking about sexuality together , the next step is sharing your concerns with the doctor . ( In part two , we will discuss what type of questions you should ask and what general items you , as a couple , should target when you see your doctor ) . <p> After prostate surgery , it 's not uncommon for men to have concerns over their ability to perform as they had before . This is natural and can be the root cause of a tailspin of depression because they feel their masculinity has been compromised . There are many ways to get around this in most cases , and " getting back in the saddle " is one of the best ways to do it ! <p> In the meantime , try to reconnect in small physical ways , like holding hands , kissing and massage if he is willing . It will make you feel closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel physical again . <p> We also have a piece of advice for you : while he is uninterested in being sexual , you owe it to yourself to make sure your sexual needs are met , so take yourself on a date ! Masturbation is a wonderful stress reliever and it will give you all the wonderful sex hormones we need to stay healthy and sane . Masturbation would be a great idea for him too , but he may not be ready to try it yet . ( That 's a suggestion the doctor might make . ) <p> Keep in mind , too , that many men post surgery need more direct genital stimulation to become aroused . They also may need more time to get in the mood , so fantasy can play a great role in dialing up the temperature in your bedroom . Our third installment on this topic will be about the things you can do sexually to revitalize your relationship . As we age , sex changes and what worked to turn us on 10 or 20 years ago may not work so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or after menopause for women . <p> In the meantime , spend an afternoon together and reconnect .

Why else do we imbibe so much information about how to keep our sex lives interesting ? Having said that , we know all too well that life happens to our relationships and consequently , what we hold dear , namely our sex , invariably becomes affected .

In other words , if we plan to turn around our sex lives in marriage then we have to assume personal responsibility for what our sex lives have morphed into . Yes , we know that marriage is a partnership of two , but this does not deny the power of one to stimulate a much needed change .

It starts with honest self-reflection and a commitment to ditch the old in order to embrace the new . <p> Here are five things you need to be willing to let go . <p> 1 . Our negative self-image : If we really want to feel sensuous and desirable , then we need to drop this like a hot potato . Yes , we live in a society obsessed with perfectionespecially in the beauty industry , however in the real world without Photoshop none of us is physically perfect .

Learning to prioritize and deliberately reserving time for our sex life can actually go a long way in restoring our flagging desire .

Hollywood " sexpectations : " While we may all enjoy those riveting romantic scenes in the movies where everything works like clockwork on cue , real lovemaking tends to be a lot less smooth and a lot more unpredictable .

Here are four lessons you and your spouse can teach your kids at home so they are better prepared for the lessons they learn at school . <p> 1 . Teach Your Children to be Organized <p> When children feel organized , are confident that they know what to do , and have all their needed materials , confidence rises , and so does the quality of their work . <p> * Prepare a checklist of things your child needs to bring to and from school every day . Put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backpack . Check often to see if your child is remembering the items on the list . <p> * Create a system with your child for recording their homework assignments . Even young children can use a planner or calendar . <p> * Pack backpacks at night . Gym clothes , notes for the teacher , school books , and homework can be packed in the evening , leaving just a lunchbox to be added in the morning . <p> * Design a plan for how kids will remember to turn in their completed assignments . Many kids do their homework , but fail to turn it in . A separate " Homework Binder " might help . <p> 2 . Teach Your Children to Manage Their Time Wisely <p> Some homework assignments are due in one week , two weeks , or longer . Teach your kids how to complete those assignments without waiting until the last minute . <p> * Record all assignments on a calendar by breaking it down into small pieces . For a book report , the steps might be : choose the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover page , type and print the report , put all the parts together . <p> * Add " Work on book report " to the list of nightly assignments . <p> * Plan how much time is needed for homework each night .

" First you complete your homework and get your backpack ready for tomorrow , and then you can watch TV . " <p> 3 . Teach Your Children How to Focus <p> While many teens do their homework in a sea of distractions , we need to limit the distractions that our younger kids experience . <p> * Give your child a snack when they get home from school . It is hard to focus when hungry . <p> * Keep the computer in a public place , and restrict the use of email or games while doing their work . You do not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check often . If they do make the choice to break the rule , then they will lose the use of the computer for fun that night . <p> * Find a quiet place with few distractions for a homework station . Playful siblings and the TV can be huge distractions , and so the homework station should be fairly quiet . <p> 4 . Teach Your Children How to Enjoy School <p> Our children have many years of school ahead of them , and many get burned out at a young age . The goal of school is to learn to love learning , not to get straight As . It is our job to promote a healthy , fun , and encouraging attitude towards school . <p> * Praise the effort , not the result . Hang some of their work on the fridge , and sometimes hang a paper with mistakes . <p> * Ask your child to tell you one thing about school each day ; they do n't  have to share every detail . <p> * Remember that it is your childs assignment , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supplying help when they ask for it .

My significant other , Angelika Kasten , immediately asked why this is such a big issue for men when women typically make less money than their husbands , yet have no problem with it . She suggested that while women value a spouse who is hard working and makes enough money , the difference in income is much less important if that spouse is loving , respectful and has a strong sense of him- or her-self . Angelika said that there are many ways to contribute a fair share to the relationship that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns about income levels .

I , for example , often defer to Angelikas superior sense of direction and she has generously given me a GPS device for my birthday . She gently reminded me that though she 's a better skier and dancer than I am she does n't  rub that in , but rather respects me for gracefully accepting my inferior place in these areas while cheering her on . <p> Focus on Self-Respect If a spouse doubts his or her significance in the relationship , it puts their partner in the awful dilemma of worrying about outshining their mateand hurting the " male ego " to the point of not fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your relationship in a way that brings your spouse joy , safety , respect and love , there 's no reason to feel inferior . <p> Instead of comparing yourself to your spouse , being envious of them and begrudging them their success , honor your own gifts and be grateful for your work and your interests . Salary and income , after all , are measures of what the society values , not what is the most important to your spouse . If a man can listen to his wife and communicate without arguing or trying to fix herI am toldmost women will consider these skills worth more than double the mans actual income . <p> Comparisons : Positive or Negative Negative comparisons are very damaging to your self-esteem .

Here are six ways on how you can reconnect with your power and create a more satisfying life.BY DR . NANCY D. OREILLY <p> DepositPhotos Women are in a position today to explore and excel that their passions like never before . <p> " I want this to be the year you finally stop living by default and start connecting to your passion . " <p> Statistics show there has never been a better time to be a woman . As of 2014 , there were almost 9.1 million female-owned businesses in the United States , generating more than $1.4 trillion ( yes , with a " T " ) in revenue . The percentage of women who are household breadwinners is rising . Young American women are 33 percent more likely than their male peers to have earned a college degree by age 27 . And around the world , women hold several of the highest offices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many of us seem unsettled and wary of using our own power . Were all too willing to hand it over to other people : our families , our friends , our employers , and more . What gives ? <p> Too often , women make choices that benefit everyone else in our lives instead of doing what we , personally , are passionate about . We move in directions that take us further from our dreams . We rob ourselves of connections that could sustain us and of relationships that bring us joy . <p> This is n't surprising ; after all , centuries ( millennia , even ! ) of socialization have taught women that our primary role is to support and care for others . Even now this attitude is alive and well . ( Consider the fact that while women continue to take on a greater role in the workforce , the amount of time we spend on housework has n't  changed much at all in recent years . ) <p> Well , enough is enough . I want this to be the year you finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its your time , just as much as ( and dare we say , more than ) it is your husbands , your childrens , or your bosss . <p> For many women , the biggest obstacle to claiming and using our power is that we are n't  completely sure how to tap into it and where to channel it ! Weve been so busy devoting our time and energy to everyone else around us that we may not even know what we care about most deeply . <p> The only way to figure out what your passion is and to learn how to direct it is to purposefully turn your power up a notch . here 's how : <p> 1 . Deliberately get uncomfortable . No one ever did anything great by staying in her comfort zone . As anyone who has ever given birth to a child knows , passion is often born of pain ! But exploring new territory can be scary stuff , and most of us will avoid it if we can . Unfortunately , by doing so , we also avoid growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , but to engage with others who challenge you , make you think , and sometimes even make you angry . <p> The messages that set us on fire are not always delivered in a positive way . Believe it or not , my own journey toward empowering and partnering with other women began with my high school counselor , who advised me to forget about college and look into secretarial school . Well , that advice ignited something powerful within me , but not in the way the counselor intended ! <p> " As anyone who has ever given birth to a child knows , passion is often born of pain ! " <p> 2 . No excuses : Start working out . Do n't  worry ; I 'm not going to harp on your BMI , cholesterol , or blood pressure ( though those things are important ) . The fact is , if you feel tired , stiff , weak , or in pain , you are unlikely to take on that next ambitious challenge . The less you do , the less you can do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort zone ! And besides helping you build up the physical resources you need , exercise relieves stress , helps you relax , and produces the " happy hormones " that keep you strong and resilient . In short , you must exercise to be at your best . And if you 're saying , " I do n't  have time , " well , I encourage you to think about it in terms of loving , respecting , and maintaining the one body and the one life you 've been given . <p> 3 . Move to Connecting 2.0 . The " connecting " too many of us do is of the " mile-wide , inch-deep " variety . But real connecting is not just about attending surface-level meet-and-greets and collecting hundreds of Facebook friends . Its much deeper . It requires you to stop wondering , What can I get from you ? and start thinking , What can we accomplish together ? <p> This is Connecting 2.0 , and making the shift changes everything . How well we can truly partner with other people ( especially with other women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to make satisfying , mutually fulfilling connections . As you seek out ways to collaborate with other great women , aim for a good mix of social networking , phone time , and face time . Remember , this is n't all about business . Its also about building real relationships . Even introverts wo n't mind doing this once they see how good it feels to connect this way . <p> 4 . If you ca n't figure out where to channel your power , look to your friends . After years of doing what they think they should be doing instead of what they want to be doing , many women simply do n't  know what their strengths and skills are . If this sounds like you , do n't  strike out blindly . You wo n't get far if you are n't  moving in a direction that 's aligned with your goals and values . For instance , getting a professional certification in a career field that does n't  fire you up might make you a better employee , but it wo n't bring you closer to living your purpose . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they know you better than you know yourself . They are n't  bogged down by your particular routine and worries , and they are in a better position to notice the things that make you smile and that youre inherently good at . What do your friends admire about you ? What do they encourage you to accomplish ? <p> 5 . Practice staying present . How often have you " lost " a few minutes ( or a whole hour ) or even more ruminating on something that happened in the past or worrying about what might happen in the future ? The point is , whether you ca n't stop thinking about an argument you had with your teenager or are concerned about how a client will respond to your proposal , you are n't  focusing , creating , doing , or developing right now . <p> When you can learn to stay present , you 'll fret less and become more powerful . And its ironic that so many of us struggle to stay present because it really is the simplest , most natural thing in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tune in to what were seeing , hearing , touching , smelling , and tasting right now . <p> Challenge yourself to notice something beautiful about your surroundings . Allow yourself to feel grateful for it . Gratitude awakens us , and when were awake , we can see our opportunities and rise to our challenges instead of obsessing about our barriers and failures . <p> " When you are able to observe a positive difference in the world because of something you did , you 'll tap into a powerful well of motivation . " <p> 6 . This year , do one thing to change the world . When you are able to observe a positive difference in the world because of something you did , you 'll tap into a powerful well of motivation . You do n't  have to solve world hunger or found an orphanage ; in fact , I encourage you to start small . For instance , organize a panel of successful female entrepreneurs to speak to a local womens group . Start volunteering at a local animal shelter . Or simply start picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood . <p> A few years ago , I had the privilege of meeting the Dalai Lama . He impressed me when he said that the future of the world rests in the hands of Western women , but we would be able to fulfill this destiny only when we wake up . I so believe this , and I also think the opposite is truechanging your corner of the world for the better invigorates your whole being . Its an amazing way to access your power . <p> Once you take those first few jarring steps forward and stop living by default , connecting to your purpose will become incrementally easier .

There 's nothing wrong with self-improvement , but it needs to come from a place of love . Yes , you need to love and forgive yourself for your mistakes and shortcomings and that 's tough for many Americans . <p> The American work ethic has made our country great , but it has also made us chronically unhappy . Many of us have a , " **38;1141;TOOLONG " mindset that 's antithetical to happiness .

When you combine those strengths with a desire to do something good , its a double whammy . For example , if you 're a store manager with a flair for writing , and you also love animals , you might offer to pen a weekly newspaper column for a local dog or cat rescue group . <p> 4 . Build richer relationships with loved ones . Is your marriage running on autopilot ? What about your relationship with your kids ? Do you come home from work and sit in front of the computer while they play in another room ( or worse , watch TV ) ? Too many Americans fail to engage their families in a meaningful way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy your loved ones could be bringing you , on top of that you end up feeling guilty about neglecting them .

Celebrate your spouse . And speaking of your marriage how is it ? If your marriage is mired in negativity or characterized by bickering or tension , you 'll never be happy . The good news is that it may not take a lot of effort to dramatically change the tenor of your marriage . <p> If you 've gotten to a place where you resent your spouse or feel chronically angry with him or her , only you can change that . Make an effort to speak gently and kindly . Surprise her with a small gift , or do one of his chores , or pick up something special for dinner . Random acts of kindness are always powerful , and that 's even truer inside a marriage . <p> 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course you need to let your close friends and family members know how you feel about them .

Most of us are too self-conscious to make a big fuss over the people who are sort of on the periphery of our lives but who nonetheless make a big impactand changing that is a key component of happiness . <p> Be generous with hugs . I 've always been a hugger , and while people may be taken aback at first , they quickly come to appreciate my openness . If you 're just not the hugging type , that 's fine : Try thank-you notes instead . Letting people know how grateful you are for what they do makes two people happy : them and you . <p> 7 .

You are the one walking around feeling miserable while the objects of your anger are often totally oblivious to your feelings . <p> The point ? Resolve to forgive someone who has caused you pain . Whether you call or visit an estranged ex-friend or write a letter to a deceased parent , you may find the gesture immensely liberating . <p> 8 . Become a giver . Happiness is not about how much you make ; its about how much you share . Your income and/or net worth has nothing to do with happiness .

" <p> Now that the dust has settled on the popular movie Fifty Shades of Grey ( and sequel ) , the time might be ripe for some honest introspection , in terms of how we perceive some of the issues raised by the film . Why , for example , are we so riveted by the idea of sexual submission ? <p> Although we may each experience sex differently , what remains common , perhaps , is the understanding that a sexual relationship involves at some level the surrendering of personal power .

Women who are comfortable in leadership or decision-making roles at home or work , may prefer a dynamic where they are allowed to figuratively lie back and be told what to do or how to be sexually . <p> For the woman who may hold the reins of power at work or with her kids , surrendering those reins willingly can be the ultimate turn-on for her .

If our sense of who we are becomes lost in our partners desires , then we are treading the line of self-abasement and need to take stock of ourselves . <p> It also becomes important for us to examine our motives when pushing the envelope sexually .

Maybe you do n't  need to blame anyone . <p> * Accept the fact that , after the age of one or two , unconditional love will only come from a puppy or yourself . You will not find unconditional love from drugs , achievements or even your spouse . Mourn the loss of that brief period of unconditional love and paradise and begin building a state of unconditional acceptance within yourself . Maybe you can accept that you are no longer the King or Queen of the world and that life happens without feeling a need to consult you about its plans . Remember the joke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your plans . " <p> * Choose the perspective and belief system that makes you more effective , joyful and successful .

I 'm not letting my spouse walk all over me anymore !

You 've forgotten that you 're not 100 percent of any one thing , but that you are made up of many different parts . There 's a " nice guy/gal " part to all of us , an aggressive ( the " bull-in-the-china-shop " ) part to all of us , and all sorts of parts in between .

You may think that being " strong " means being confrontational , yelling at people and insisting on getting your way . In fact , that kind of " strong " is just one facet of being assertive . Other facets of being assertive are standing your ground , using a firm , low voice and repetition to communicate to others your position , and learning to negotiate rather than to sacrifice . <p> If your new plan is to " be nice , " having been forceful and demanding all of your life , your vision of what being " nice " is , is probably more a vision of being a doormat . That is n't nice , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want . Rather than reverting to your old ways , learn what genuine " niceness " is all about : listening to others , caring about others as much as you do about yourself ( not instead of yourself ) , respecting both your and others needs . <p> If your primary approach to life and to your sweetheart is n't working the way you 'd like , it 's probably because you are relying too heavily on what feels comfortable and easy for you in situations where your comfort zone and the situation at hand do n't mesh . For example , ordering people around may work when you 're the football coach or the police officer , but it 's not going to get you anywhere in your personal relationships . For that , you need the part of you that is willing to listen and care . You may have buried that part of you long ago , and now fear that listening and caring are part of being " weak .

Develop those unfamiliar sides of yourself , which you recognize would be of benefit in your marriage and practice using them . <p> Pay attention to how couples you respect and admire balance the various facets of their personalities . How do other couples manage to be firm and assertive yet not terrorize their mate ? How do other couples manage to be " nice " without getting walked on ? <p> You are a valuable human being .

Life gets in the way . ( For your information as well as the other readers , couples can recapture aspects of this phase by recreating the behaviors that they did during this time . ) The trade off is that there is a stronger commitment between the two of you , as well as a greater comfort level .

And though nobody likes to be depressed or does so purposely , it does have a negative impact on all those around the person . <p> You also say that you 've gained weight . Again , I can not determine if this is because you 're so unhappy or due to " letting yourself go " as you became more comfortable with your mate . Though we would like to think that we are loved for who we are , physical attraction does have a strong impact on how our mates react to us .

You are going to need to talk to him . As I so often remind people when I work with them or write this column , make sure that you do n't  approach him in a harsh way .

You can suggest that it might be the result of all the stress but that it might also be something in the relationship that needs to be addressed . <p> Remember that most men are n't  real good at talking or expressing feelings . So keep it short and though it may be difficult , stay open to what he says rather than getting defensive .

" Consent is a subject we often associate with dating , but marriage not so much . Why is that ? Is it because after a certain amount of time passes , we just know when our significant other is " ready ? " We are so in tune with their body language that verbal consent is simply not needed ?

Actually , watching your son or daughter at a sporting event does not officially count as " family time " if you spend no other time together with your familyit simply becomes another sports event rather than quality time together . <p> Multiple distractions while texting only add further insult to the spousal relationship when you do things like texting while talking , while watching TV , while accepting incoming calls , while catching up on work that was n't completed at the office , while playing games , while checking the sports scores and the weather . <p> This behavior sends a very clear message to your spouseand kidsthat they are not as important as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are a few other times to avoid texting and taking phone calls , which I 'm guessing most of the people reading this article have broken : <p> * When involved in a heated debate with your spouse* When taking a leisurely walk with your spouse* When enjoying a romantic dinner* When having sex* When you are conveying a heartfelt apology * At your child 's dance recital , baptism or wedding * When you are celebrating your anniversary* When you are relaying bad news* When you are relaying good news * When engaged in one to one conversation with your spouse* When visiting someone 's house for dinner * At a movie or the theatre * At a church service* Weddings and funerals <p> And the list can go on and on ... <p> I was recently at a dinner party where two adult men sat next to each other on the couch , simultaneously playing games , one on his cell phone and the other on an iPad .

I mean , he walks to the bathroom with me . If I get up off the couch he wants to know where I am going . If he takes the trash to the dump he wo n't go unless I ride with him . Even if I am cooking , cleaning or whatever , he insists I ride with him . I am feeling choked . Any advice ? <p> Any healthy relationship needs to strike a comfortable balance between autonomy and connection for both partners , and it sounds like your husband is n't giving you the space you need to achieve this . While many could argue that he wants to be around you 24-7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many deep-seated factors that could be responsible for his smothering behavior ; these could include a need to feel in control , insecurity , or even an indication of an obsessive personality type . <p> Controlling partners typically smother out of a need to attain or maintain power . They do not feel safe in a relationship unless they feel in control of every situation at hand . Insecurity , often , is also a factor ; partners who are afraid you will leave them for someone else or betray them can also smother . They feel if they can keep you close they will know where you are at all times and protect themselves from betrayal in the process . In this scenario , its best to build confidence and trust in your relationship and you both may need to seek professional help to do thisespecially if there was an indiscretion within your relationship in the past . If its an obsessive compulsive behavior , this is also something that will need to be addressed by a qualified professional . <p> Either way , it is very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , and that you do so in a positive way . For instance , you do n't  want to wait until you become so irritated that you blow up and put him on the defense . Instead , communicate your feelings from a personal point of view ; you can do this by using " I " -centered statements . For example , you could say , " Its important that I have some alone time or personal space to be happy and at peace . " <p> Let him know that this is true in all of your relationships , not just your relationship with him . Perhaps this will make him feel less attacked or rejected by the discussion . You could also gently let him know that while you appreciate his desire to always be with you , that your relationship will have a better opportunity to grow if you both do n't have the independence to grow as individuals . He needs to understand that your relationship has a better chance to survive in the long-term if you are not burnt out on one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number one way to put the fire out . <p> The situation you are currently in is definitely not a healthy one , and if he does not respond positively to a discussion about it , you may want to consider counseling .

For many , the ultimate goal is to win , but there is a cost associated with poor sportsmanship and , as a parent , it is our responsibility to raise a strong child and a good sport . Here are 11 ways you and your spouse can become a better team when it comes to coaching your child . <p> Good Sportsmanship Tips:1 . Be a good role model for your children . Children learn by exampleshow them how to practice good sportsmanship by not always expecting to win . Explain that winning is not always an option , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good attitude , team spirit and respect for others is as important as the outcome of the game . <p> 2 . Good sportsmanship is a clear quality of good character . Teach your children how to interact with their elders , coaches and peers by having a positive attitude , one that shows respect for all involved in the game . Remind your child to shake hands at the end of each game with his or her opponent , and do n't  forget to say " good game . " This step teaches self-confidence and is an exercise that will stay with them as they grow and develop . <p> 3 . Keep your own ego out of your childrens game . Some parents tend to live vicariously through their childrens sports success . A parent must stay focused on their childs interests and abilities and get over their own high school insecurity . <p> 4 . Emphasize other aspects of the game such as friendship , skill , exercise and relationship building . These are major factors that contribute to a successful athletic experience . <p> 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Mind your own sideline behavior . Do not try to coach the coach , your child or other members of the team during the game . Regardless of how bad the call , refrain from yelling or shouting profanities at the official . Let them do their job , and you do yours , which is to support and encourage your child to have fun and do their best . <p> 8 . Teach your child how to take personal responsibility for situations . If your child made a bad play , so what ? Do n't  try to blame the play on someone else to prevent your child from having a hurt ego .

Even if your child made the winning basket , teach him to share his success as a team member . Just like an adults success at the office takes a support team of professionals , remind your child that it takes teamwork to win a game . Even if your child made the winning basket , the team as a whole should be included in the glory . <p> 10 . Use the language of a good sport . Talk to your child about the importance of character , integrity , humility and respect . Your child will identify with these words if they are seeing it modeled on the sideline . <p> 11 . Turn to the news for both good and bad examples of good sportsmanship . Discuss local and national stories with your child and use these stories as examples of good versus bad sportsmanship and point out how a persons behavior directly affects the way others view the persons character . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Game , " which only allowed clapping from the sidelines .

But what about past hurts with your spouse that you cant let go ? Are you finding that because of these hurts you have more pain than happiness in your relationship ? <p> When you get hurt by your partner , you lose trust and may even feel betrayed . " If he really loved me , he would n't hurt me ! " After being hurt many times over , your emotions tend to close up , and your heart , in turn , shuts down your ability to be intimate , both sexually and verbally . Your partner then becomes more of a roommate than a spouse , with conversations turning from intimate exchanges to logistic-specific dialogues like , " Whos picking up the kids ? Whos cooking dinner ? Whos making the weekend plans ? " I have worked with many couples that have " lost that loving feeling " and , upon examination , it often comes down to the inability to let go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help let go of the hurt in your marriage and to recapture the love and happiness you both once shared : <p> 1 . Identify the hurt . Go back to the first hurt and identify your reactiondid you cry , shut down , try to talk to your partner or brush it off ? Did you feel you were heard and understood ? After you 've remembered the first hurt , see if the other hurts were similar . This will help clarify your feelings and give you a starting point for talking about these feelings with your partner . <p> 2 . Set a time to talk to your partner . Invite your partner to talk by letting your spouse know that even though that first hurt seemed small , it has now grown and you 're still holding onto it . By acknowledging and taking your feelings seriously , you are taking the first step to letting go of your hurt . Do n't  be hard on yourself that you feel this way , just do something about ittalk to your partnerdont hold the feelings in any longer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Listen . The best way to really listen is to take turns talking to each other . Rather than having a dialogue , have two monologues . Put your feelings aside and for two to three minutes let your partner talk . During that time , do n't  interrupt him or comment on his point of view . Really look and listen to your partner . Then switch . Taking turns listening gives each of you a chance to be heard . When you truly listen without talking , you will hear things in a very different way , and your dialogue will create a whole new perspective . <p> 4 . Bring yourself into present time . Now that you both have really listened to each other , you are in present time with a chance to let go of your past hurts . So often hurts start from a miscommunication or misunderstanding . Because you feel so hurt , you forget to check in with your partner to see if you heard him right . So check in , and by doing this , you will begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking in a new way .

Make a plan to keep your relationship current . After you have talked and expressed your hurt(s) to your spouse and you feel listened to and understood , make an agreement to talk about a hurt as soon as it occurs . Do n't  let one hurt become two . If you deal with that one hurt right away , it is small and relatively easy to resolve . Once it starts building into two , three or four , it becomes bigger and harder to deal with .

Some things I can get with , but others I just need to have . How do I regain the space I want and get " me " back for a day or two . <p> I truly believe that one of the main reasons the divorce rate is so high is because couples go into their marriages with the wrong expectations . Perhaps one of the biggest errors is thinking your partner will change or you will change your partner . There 's a favorite expression that I teach : " What you see is what you get , the only thing that changes is that you get more of it . " I 'm sorry to say this , but in your case , neither you nor your wife realized this to be the case . <p> First , let me explain what I mean . In most cases , people are who they are and reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traits might not be glaring because initially people do attempt to make a good impression . The other factor is that if you become smitten with someone , emotion is now interfering with clear thinking ; there 's a real good chance you are not going to see a negative aspect to someone you are falling in love with or at least , you wo n't deem it important . That 's why so often others can see something that you cant . <p> When the two of you become more comfortable with one another , each of you starts to relax and youre not as concerned about your little idiosyncrasies or imperfections . When that happens , the very same traits become " louder , " so to speak . So , the woman who was initially so caring starts to feel like an overbearing mother ; or the man who was so romantic by merely telling you what to wear and what time to be ready , you now experience as controlling . <p> From what you write , your wife is having trouble with the notion that you are who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to change you even when you were in college . Clearly , that is who she is ; there was no reason to think that quality in her would just change because the college days ended or because you got married . <p> Its really important that you bring this matter up to her . I have seen too many couples not address issues that bother them with the hope that things will somehow get better . Unfortunately , it does n't  work that way , in most cases it only makes things worse , to a point where there 's a wedge between them with lots of resentful feelings . <p> You need to let her know that her desire to frequently alter who you are is uncomfortable to you . Try to go into this discussion with an open mind because my guess is that if she 's trying to get you to make changes , there are certain things that are making her unhappy . Find out what they are . Be willing to listen and consider compromises . <p> Do n't  be surprised if she points out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objected in the past . Should that be the case , you 'll have to acknowledge that you thought it would change and that it really has begun to bother you . <p> Remember to have this discussion in a non-attacking way . This is not necessarily the time to bring up the things youd like her to change unless she asks . <p> I 'm well aware that opening up a talk like this might be a challenge since , stereotypically , guys do n't  initiate such dialogues . But as I said , its really vital to do so because the situation is not going to change on its own . Plus , it will probably serve you well just by the very fact that you do raise it , on lots of different levels ! 113807 @qwx733807

Use these simple tips to get back and make a real connection with your spouse.BY DENISE J CHARLES <p> BigStockPhoto One of the first steps in overcoming sexual anxiety is to discuss sexual performance with your spouse . <p> " It is important that a couple moves away from the childish , larger-than-life expectations of standard romantic fare , or of porn movies for that matter . " <p> If we are honest , most of us want to be assured that our spouse is sexually happy with us . We sense instinctively that this is necessary for the survival of the union . Of course there are a few who claim not to care or who cant be bothered . For the rest of us , however , there is that innate desire to keep the sexual fires hot and blazing , if only we could overcome our sexual silence . <p> I recently read an article that touted seven sure ways for a woman to know how good she was in bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her how she was doing or how he felt about their sex life . It was all about reading his body language cues during and after sex , like whether or not his hands and feet were tightly clenched in absolute ecstasy . Body language might be fine , but why are we afraid to say what we want , like or hate in the bedroom ? I believe that this fear mirrors an underlying anxiety many of us have about sex . In other words , our sexual anxiety keeps our mouths closed , and the fact that were not communicating about sex robs the experience of some of the joy de vivre it should have . <p> The reality is that sex remains a difficult topic to broach by even those sharing the experience . And because we are inundated by so much information about sex , those of us who do care can begin to wonder about our partners sexual satisfaction and about our own ability to bring sustained pleasure . This is particularly true in a relationship like marriage , which can seem to suffer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly having sex with the same person and possibly in the same space over an extended period of time . <p> So how is this anxiety manifested and how can it be remedied ? The experience of sexual anxiety in a context like marriage will occur in different ways at different stages of the relationship and it is also likely to be experienced differently by men and women . <p> The Passionate Years <p> In the early years where passion is hot and in great supply , anxiety may be centered on creating a good first-impression and maintaining it . While we women may worry about how imperfect our bodies appear in bright light , our men may tend to worry about controlling their sexual excitement long enough to prevent premature ejaculation . The fact that we are now learning each others bodies adds to the sense of excitement and sex becomes wonderfully expressive and spontaneous . This may especially be so since there are likely to be no kids around to cramp our style . Unless there are serious issues with sexual inhibitions or with sexual control , bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there is little dialogue . <p> The Middle Years <p> As life becomes more complicated and sex is affected by the humdrum of life , our anxiety in the bedroom may also go up a notch . Dealing with our kids , their activities , our bills , work pressure and growing financial responsibilities can all take a toll on bedroom activity . While men may become anxious about the lack of frequency , women may tend to be concerned that sex has become routine , predictable , and lacking in romance . The major issues are therefore sexual quality and quantity . Since sex may be had mostly in survival mode at this stage , both partners may become concerned that their best years are behind them and the temptation may be to " settle " for less .

This can be a source of sweet anticipation or downright worry . For us women , with the possibility of babies behind us , we might feel that there is a whole new lease on our sex lives only to find that our spouse might be struggling with the issue of erectile dysfunction . A husband who may experience problems with diminished desire or who may have a challenge maintaining an erection may deliberately avoid sexual intimacy because he has performance anxiety . Diminished sexual activity can result in a whole slew of worries for the mature wife who can become concerned about her own sexual desirability and her ability to keep her husband " turned on " to sex . <p> While life-change is inevitable , exposing our fears and vulnerabilities at each juncture of a marriage is the only way to experience couple-growth . Although we may never completely eradicate a tendency to worry about the quality of our intimate lives , the following relationship " best practices " should help us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 5 Marriage Best Practices <p> Set realistic sexual expectations : It is important that a couple moves away from the childish , larger-than-life expectations of standard romantic fare , or of porn movies for that matter . While sizzling , orgasmic sex is a wonderful goal to have , couples should realistically understand that in the context of an extended relationship like marriage , sex will have its share of ups and downs . When these are expected , there is no cause for major panic or for foolish decision making , like chasing after a new sexual thrill . When a couple understands that the novelty-phase of their sex life will eventually wane , they can then go about the business of redefining their sexual relationship during the different phases of their lives . <p> Establish your own unique sexual rhythm as a couple : Never mind what the national average is , it is important that couples understand that they 're not in a competition with the neighbors next door . What you decide to do in your own bedroom and how often you decide to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading books and articles is great for offering ideas , each couple is responsible for emerging their own sexual rhythm and identity , which suits the tone and texture of their own marriage . <p> Have regular sex : While establishing a unique rhythm is good , understanding the benefits of regular sex should also not be less counted . Studies do show that regular sex triggers increased libido , romance and attachment in couples . Apart from its much-touted physical health benefits , regular sexual intimacy reinforces a couples desirability for each other . This is ego-boosting and affirms sexual self-esteem . When a husband and wife feel sexually affirmed , there is far less to worry in the sexual department . <p> Talk about your sex life : Keeping the channels of communication open is a great way to allay fears and anxiety . This includes being upfront about what you like , dislike or desire . Sexual desires should also be communicated in a caring , non-confrontational way . The emphasis here is not on making unreasonable sexual demands because you think your partner is a lousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in more dynamic ways which are guaranteed to enhance the relationship . This often means marrying sexual assertiveness with sensitivity . Owning what you want or expect , instead of blaming your partner for what is lacking , is also a far less intrusive approach . Openness and honesty also breed intimacy , which is likely to reinforce the desire to be more sexual . <p> Extend your concept of " great sex : " When we worry about our sex lives , chances are we are focusing on what happens in the actual bed ( or wherever we do it ) . We are likely to be thinking about the logistics of straight-up sex . Even where erectile dysfunction may be an issue , apart from seeking medical help , it is important for a man to know that his penis is not his only sexual organ . In allaying our sense of anxiety as we seek to improve our married sex , it is critical that we extend our concept of a great sex life . The truth is that what happens in the bedroom begins a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , giving compliments , being thoughtful , touching , hugging and kissing outside the bedroom , are all ways to preserve a sense of sexual tension in the relationship . Hopefully , as the relationship becomes more integrated , there is less pressure to view the bedroom experience as the only source for physical and emotional intimacy .

KAREN SHERMAN <p> BigStockPhoto With a better understanding of how emotional attachments are made , you can adjust your behavior . <p> Many years ago , a very famous study was done with rhesus monkeys by Harlowe &amp; Harlowe . Surrogate mothers were created by forming the shape of a monkey out of wire . There were two types of " mothers : " one type was rigged to give the baby monkeys food , and the other had cloth over the wire but were not able to offer food . <p> The young monkeys were put into situations that created anxiety . The findings were that the baby monkeys sought out the cloth " mothers " rather than those who offered food during these periods , indicating a need for contact comfort . This has now become a famous study indicating the need for attachment and comfort in relationships . <p> No doubt , relationships are important . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both physical and psychological health . <p> Do as the Monkey Does <p> Though mentioned in last weeks article , I think its worth repeating once more and in greater detail . Studies done more recently with monkeys have once again indicated some very interesting findings . They have shown that within the brain there are mirror neurons , which become activated merely by watching an individual do something . That is to say , the brain does not actually have to perform the behavior ; mere observation of another doing it is enough for a neural connection to be made . <p> This has a very significant meaning because it indicates that the brain is able to tune-in to another persons experience . It also demonstrates a connection between mind and body . To offer a concrete example , during the feeding experience between a mother and infant , when the mother smiles at the baby , the baby will reflect that smile and respond in kind . This very pleasant , comforting and secure experience is also creating a neural connection in the babys brain . ( Additionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a shared experience . ) <p> Emotions are Contagious <p> Though the example Ive given is between a baby and mother , this interaction is by no means limited to this type of relationship . Emotions are contagious at all ages and in all types of relationships . Consider how easily your own emotions are affected by those around youwhether they are impacted upwardly or downwardly . And just as the example with baby and mama is bidirectional , so is the relationship with your spouse . If you are negative , it will have an effect on your mate . Then your spouse responds negatively and the spiral has started . <p> There are a variety of ways that emotions get conveyed : through facial expressions , by ones posture and tone of voice . Emotions can even be sensed on a more subtle energetic level . <p> Let this information become a source of strength . Having an understanding and awareness that this phenomenon happens , there are things you can do to strengthen the emotional connections with your husband or wife : <p> 1 . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of reacting . 2 . Remember , chances are that if your partner is acting negative , something is emotionally bothering him or her . 3 . Many times , if you can match your body language to his or hers , your mate , unknowingly , will feel more understood . 4 . Never dismiss the other persons feelings , but consider going back to the suggestions in the last two posts . 5 . Finally , when some of the emotions have calmed down , do a " check-in " on your own attitude . Does it need to be lifted up a bit , too ? After all , the emotional contagion works both ways . 113807 @qwx733807 
@@79604893 @1104893/ <p> 3 Tips to Embrace Forgiveness in MarriageNobody 's perfect . Even when facing major mistakes , forgiveness is a choice . Here 's how to forgive your spouse.BY DENISE J. CHARLES <p> Depositphoto Nobody 's perfect , but you have the power to forgive . <p> " The fact that we 're living with an individual with an entirely different way of doing things , means that we will often find ourselves at cross purposes with our spouse . " <p> The sense of betrayal is a powerful emotion to experience in a marriage . When we commit to someone , we expect that this will be reciprocal . We do n't only think of relationship loyalty in terms of sexual loyalty , but we expect that our loved one will basically have our back . We want someone who will look out for us , support our efforts , give loving but constructive feedback and commit to standing by our side through thick and thin . <p> What happens , however , when our spouse does what we perceive to be unforgivable ? Maybe he sleeps with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sexual inadequacy with a close male friend , perhaps he forgets an important anniversary or birthday or fails to admit readily that he fathered someone else 's child while still married to you . <p> Whatever the relationship challenge requiring forgiveness is , chances are we will each respond differently based on our understanding of forgiveness and our forgiveness-style . Our intimate relationship may seem unique , but how we navigate it is usually influenced by our initial experiences with love , loyalty , rejection , acceptance and abandonment . Whether these occurred during childhood or previous adult relationships , we often develop a coping or adjustment style which will influence how we continue to respond in future relationship scenarios . <p> For example , a stable , loving and affirming home environment usually strengthens feelings of self-worth . When an individual feels that he/she is worthy of love , then there tends to be less of a challenge extending genuine forgiveness , since there may be the feeling that there is a lot of love to pass around . At the same time , a stronger sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with repeated acts of infidelity or abuse because she understands her value . <p> Outside these fairly serious examples given , common everyday differences will also require acts of forgiveness on the part of both spouses in a relationship . The fact that we 're living with an individual with an entirely different way of doing things , means that we will often find ourselves at cross purposes with our spouse . If we want to maintain a healthy marriage , then understanding how we feel about forgiveness and practicing it actively may make the difference between a strained relationship and one that brings deep satisfaction . The following should assist us in strengthening our marriage through the act of forgiveness . <p> 1 . Accept imperfection in our partner . Although we hardly admit it , we often expect perfection in our partner even if not in ourselves . We want someone to act as the " be all and end all " of our lives ; someone who will make us feel totally loved and meet all of our needs . Recognizing that except for God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation or fantasy , can go a long way toward our acceptance of our partner 's humanity . While this does not mean lowering our standards about significant deal-breakers in the relationship , accepting imperfection can strengthen our ability to extend forgiveness when required . <p> 2 . See forgiveness as a process and not an event . Forgiveness between people is unlikely to occur in one fell swoop . It does not mean immediately getting over the pain of disappointment or betrayal nor does it mean completely erasing what has occurred from memory . Many of us forgive unsuccessfully because we do not allow ourselves to grieve over whatever loss has been experienced in our relationship . This is particularly true of infidelity . If we never allow ourselves to really get in touch with our pain and we attempt to gloss it over quickly under the guise of " forgiveness " because we want to save our marriage , then this can come back to haunt us . Grieving may include crying , screaming , sleeping separately for a while , writing about it , talking it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel about what has occurred . This is the first step toward personal healing and makes the act of extending forgiveness far more meaningful . <p> 3 . Put ourselves in our partner 's shoes . Forgiveness is about extending grace to someone else who has done us wrong . When we acknowledge our own humanity and admit that we too often fail , then forgiveness is not such a major issue . We also hurt our partner and will expect to be forgiven . Ultimately , forgiveness is a higher-order skill requiring humility and the ability to extend ourselves . While it carries the risk that we could be hurt again , self-love is also a relationship requirement which allows us to remove ourselves from a dangerous relationship . No matter what type of relationship pain we have experienced , the decision to forgive , which is an act of the will and not a feeling , frees us to live again .

" <p> February 14th is the day couples show their love for one another , and it usually comes in the form of flowers , candy or a romantic dinner for just the two of you . While that 's all-important and should n't be overlooked , if you really want to connect on a higher level , there is nothing sexier than a person who projects intelligence and confidence . I prefer to call it " intellectual foreplay , " and it means making the connection on an emotional level through better conversation , intellect and body language . <p> If done properly , intellectual foreplay will strengthen a weak marriage and make a strong one even stronger .

@@79604902 @1104902/ <p> DepositPhotos Making the right choices is the first step in maintaining sexual integrity in your marriage . <p> " Sexual integrity can be defined as any sexual behavior , which is aligned with the greater good of the relationship . " <p> Most of us know instinctively that a relationship , like marriage , should be characterized by such values as honesty , trust , loyalty and selflessness . These are expected and come with the marital territory . Yet many within the context of marriage have experienced broken vows , disloyalty and disappointment . Of course , there are a slew of reasons as to why these instances occur and these are individual enough to fill an entire book on the topic . Chief among these reasons , however , is the issue of a lack of sexual integrity . The following fictitious scenarios are written to assist us in wrapping our minds around this concept of sexual integrity and how it should empower our relationships . <p> How Lust Can Transform Behavior <p> Stacy gave one last downwards tug to her tight blouse to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too familiar with the heady thrill of sexual power . It gave her a peculiar rush to walk through the doors of " The Red Room , " the bar she had frequented every Friday evening for the past six months since assuming her new job in the downtown financial center . She had grown accustomed to the lecherous eyes , which caressed her breasts and looked deeply into her eyes asking questions she was only too willing to answer . In fact , she welcomed those lustful stares with every fiber of her being . They made her feel wanted and oh so powerful . <p> She perched gingerly atop her favorite bar-stool being sure to allow her ample derriere to protrude at just the right angle . This was guaranteed to bring even more attention since she was sure every man in the room appreciated her voluptuous curves . These were the well-known tricks of her trade ; the calculated use of her body in a clever little game of sexual conquest . As she called for a stiff scotch on the rocks , she surveyed the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill . It was then that she spotted him . Sitting and swirling an anonymous brown liquid absentmindedly was absolutely the hottest man she had ever seen . There were two things about him that drew her like a moth to the flame . One was the large size of his hands ( she believed every story she had heard about a man with large hands ) and the other ; that unmistakable glint of gold on his ring finger . As she drew near to throw down the gauntlet called deliberate eye contact , she knew that her evening held promises of wild , unbridled passion and he was n't going to be sorry he cheated . <p> Brian knew deep within his heart that there was something distinctly childish about his behavior that evening . He should n't be here sipping a drink in " The Red Room . " He had responsibilities at home and besides , his wife was expecting him but this was the third straight week that they had n't  made love . It seemed to him , that since the baby was born three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . He was tired of the gnawing desire at the pit of his stomach that refused to be assuaged . And he was n't about to " help himself , " that was not what he wanted at this stage of his life . <p> He longed for his woman , his lover , his wife . He wished that he could adequately communicate to her just how much he missed her : the enchanting curve of her neck , her smell , her breasts , her inner softness , which drove him wild with desire . Just thinking about her now brought that telltale reaction to his body and he knew instinctively that she just did not understand . He almost felt like crying and he was slightly ashamed of such a powerful emotion . <p> But then he smelt it , the familiar scent of feminine perfumeof woman . It was just beyond his sensual radar and he knew without even looking that he was being approached . As he turned his body to take a look , her breasts were everywhere and he was riveted . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight smile . But with one look she knew . She knew that he was hungry and not for food . Her eyes held promises that told him here was a woman who understood a mans needs . And she was all too prepared to deliver . <p> Dissecting Ones Sexual Integrity <p> This scenario serves to highlight how the individual stories of two strangers in a bar can converge to influence behavior , which can have a lasting impact upon an unsuspecting family . How this scenario plays out is to a large degree contingent on how Brian , our married character , decides to deal with the issue of his own sexual integrity . <p> Sexual integrity can be defined as any sexual behavior , which is aligned with the greater good of the relationship . It is the extent to which a spouses behavior , particularly sexual behavior , serves to cement the bond of intimacy in the relationship , as opposed to harming that relationship . It represents an agreement or congruence between an individuals stated sexual intentions and their behavior . You know , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship " in those marriage vows ? Well , our sexual integrity should hold us to those promises we made and should influence how we deal with relationship challenges . <p> This brings us right back to our scenario and to the options , which our character , Brian , is faced with . While our character , Stacy , also has some choices to make , her seemingly lack of sexual propriety emerges from her own value system , which places no particular stock in marital vows made by other people . In fact , she has already made her choice . Her story is included merely to help us to see how anothers behavior can influence ( not force ) the sexual choices that we make . Brians behavior , on the other hand , should be guided by his own innate desire to fulfill his marital vows , in spite of the way he feels . <p> Brians Dilemma <p> There is no doubt that Brian has experienced a great sex life with his wife . The memory of his wifes body alone is enough to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longing for her soul and her spirit . He misses her more than he is willing to admit and this makes him vulnerable to the attention of another woman . <p> There is more to this issue than a man who has n't  been laid in a while . Brian has failed to communicate to his wife just how much their sexual relationship means to him . This is in fact the crux of his dilemma : a lack of honest communication . This deep desire of Brian is also something many wives fail to understand . His need for her is more than a desire to experience a pent-up sexual release . It is through their unique physical relationship that he communicates his love for her and shares in the essence of who she is . When he is with her sexually he feels the strength and completeness of his manhood in a way that is second to none . There is nothing that can replace that sense of oneness which he experiences as they soar to the heights of sexual pleasure . When Brian has regular sex with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and then some . This is as it should be . <p> The critical question for Brian is : How will he respond now that life has brought change to his marriage ? Yes , of course he misses the testosterone-related sexual release , but more than that , his masculinity feels depleted . But the macho , self-assured man he is , Brian would never admit this type of vulnerability to the woman that means more to him than anything . To admit his need would mean that he could be rejected . In fact , he already feels rejected since his wife seems to have " fallen in love " with someone elsetheir son . And what right-thinking man is jealous of his own son ? <p> Unless Brian makes a conscious decision to preserve the integrity of his sexuality , he will fall prey to his own sexual vulnerabilities . If Brian is to preserve his own sexual sanity and the health of his marriage , then he will have to engage his brain beyond the short term . He will have to dwell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and above the swelling in his pants . He should recognize that what he stands to lose if he gives in to Stacy , the seductress in the bar , is far more than what he stands to gain . If his desire does not allow him to see above and beyond the immediate , he will experience a significant loss . Ultimately , Brians solution lies at the level of choice . <p> Of course , we have deliberately omitted the story of Brians wife , which would obviously carry its own individual perspective . While it does take two to tango , just as the power of one can destroy a relationship ( if Brian decides to cheat ) , the decision of one can also provide the context for healing . If Brian makes the right choice in forgoing this fling and communicates to his wife how he really feels , then his decision to act on his sexual integrity would have paid off .

With work calling , babies crawling , and to-do lists mounting , the idea of creating sexy , intimate times often seems like more work ! Before you know it , hot , steamy nights become a thing of the past as the television , video games , and household tasks take precedence . As intimate moments melt away , an icy chill can creep in to cause silent damage to even the best of relationships . <p> Sex is an important part of marriage , yet true physical intimacy involves far more than just sex . Emotional intimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . True intimacy allows you to feel a deep closeness to your partner that is lush and truly indescribable . Without intimacy , sex is just sex .

It is these moments of sacred intimacy between partners that creates an indelible bond and a permanent soulful connection . <p> It takes dedication and effort to develop and nourish an environment that makes intimacy an ongoing priority . Like any aspect of a relationship , honoring the importance of sexual intimacy takes time and energy . Creating fireworks in your marriage usually does not happen by chance , but it does n't  need to be difficult . And do n't  worry about the costa sexy love life surely does n't  need to be expensive or lavish . With a bit of fun and thoughtful planning , you can craft " spontaneous " explosions of passion in your marriage . <p> Remember , a healthy sexual relationship is built on good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With this foundation , you can build an intimate sexual life that is fun , wild , exploratory , and mutually satisfying . Follow these simple ideas : <p> 1 . Create the Space : Creating a sexy intimate environment involves a few important details , none of which need to be expensive or time-consuming . Start by scheduling a date with your spouse . Call the babysitter . ( If finances make babysitter fees an issue , work out a trade with relatives , neighbors , or other friendly parents . ) Learn to leave the pressures of work outside the front door . Turn on the music that reminds you of the days when time alone was hot and sexy . Turn off the lights and fill the room with the soft glow of candles . Take a bath or shower together . Splurge on a luscious body oil and spa-quality towels . Enjoy each other in slow , delicious ways that busy schedules rarely allow . Then , let nature take its course . <p> 2 . Confidence is Hot : Look in the mirror and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember that you and your sweetheart know each other more intimately than anyone else . Know that the safety and mutual respect you create in your marriage allows you to be yourself . Use that inner knowledge to strut your stuff . Your physical exterior is not nearly as important as your inner confidence and the sense that you know how to please yourself and your lover . If you have n't yet arrived at this place of strong inner self-confidence , talk openly with your husband or wife about your sensitivities and vulnerabilities . Even the most confident individuals have soft spots , and a loving spouse will take great care to honor those more delicate and sensitive areas . With gentleness , love , and compassion , the vulnerabilities heal and allow confidence to grow . In the meantime , smile at yourself in the mirror . Remind yourself how unique and hot you are , remember how much your darling loves you , and then let that sense of positivity and self-assurance shine through . Your sweetheart will find your growing confidence oh-so-attractive . <p> 3 . Eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good food when it comes to enhancing your sex life . Dinners laden with aphrodisiacs such as oysters , avocados , asparagus , almonds , honey , and chocolate can turn a date night into a super-hot encounter . Remember the power of inexpensive , sexy foods such as a simple dinner of wine , bread , cheese , and fruit . Fun-enhancing foods that can be easily transported into the bedroomsuch as a bowl of spaghetti-for-two , ice cream , chocolates , champagne , and whipped creamcan bring a sense of play and adventure into your alone time . Let your sense of fun and imagination guide you into new worlds of discovery with your sweetie . <p> 4 . The Oral Touch : Learn the power of oral intimacy . Sensual , erotic words are powerful sex toys . When it comes to precious intimate encounters , leave the troubles of work at the office . Do n't  let the worries of the outside world interfere with your amorous time alone . Try your best to have any niggling marital disagreements satisfactorily addressed so that they do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whisper sweet nothings into your lovers ear . Find the words and phrases that make your darling moan and use them with passion and delight . Women , even more than men , can be brought into the heat of the moment by that sexy verbal touch . <p> 5 . Your Sexy Body : Your body is a work of art . No work of art is perfect , so strive to love all the natural imperfections that are part of your unique body . Of course , a well-cared-for physique is terrifically attractive . This does n't  mean that ample curves , bumps , and natural flaws should ever inhibit sexuality . Good self-care , however , brings a radiant glow and inner confidence that allows the sexual self to come forward more readily and openly . So , dust off those running shoes , pick up your yoga mat , drink lots of water , and take good care of your wonderful body . Good hygiene , sweet breath , and a light mist of cologne or perfume add to the package . Nothing is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 6 . Get Back to Basics : Remember what made your heart race when you first met . Was it a moonlit walk , a dance underneath the stars , or a bonfire by the beach ? Take the time to recreate those carefree , sexy days . Watch the sparks fly as you sit back and relax to the tune of more simple times . Remember the delightfully excruciating sensation of unbuttoning a shirt or blouse one sweet step at a time . Move slowly and patiently , taking the evening as though its your first time all over again . Take the pressure off the end goal as you find the delight in kissing the nape of her neck . Enjoy knowing you can make him melt with the tender touch of your hands upon his back . Linger at the sweet spots , the ones that you may have forgotten over time . Find the undiscovered sweet spots , and relish the delight of feeling that you know how to please your spouse in the most wonderful of ways . <p> 7 .

Try Some Wild and Sexy New Moves : New fun begins when you color outside the lines of your traditional routines . Try not to get stuck in the rut of lackadaisical lovemaking .

Go where you 've never gone beforewhere you might not have thought you would ever goand watch your sweethearts eyes catch fire . <p> 9 . Get Away , Get Naked : Theres no medicine as good for a marriage as time alone . Whether you go on a private camping trip for two , turn your home into a sexy spa-hotel , or find seclusion in a couples retreat , time away allows you to restore , regenerate , and play .

" A firm handshake has been a typical Western cultural greeting in business and social situations , a standard offering of the Sign of Peace at mass , and a congenial way to approach others as a sign of goodwill . <p> Sitting in church this past Sunday the priest made an announcement that until further notice the offering of a handshake or a hug was banned in an effort to deter the spread of H1N1 . As people left the church the priest was visibly uncomfortable as he continued to apologize for the lack of hand-to-hand or hug-to-hug contact .

" Do I have to shake hands at a job interview ? " Your options are limited as you may potentially run the risk of offending the interviewer , therein losing the job opportunity .

Avoid sneezing or coughing into your own right hand and consider wearing a mask if you have a weak immune system or have flu symptoms and must be out in public . <p> 3 . " Is it customary to shake hands when someone approaches you at the dining table ? " Proper etiquette dictates that anytime someone approaches you it is your responsibility to stand up and shake hands .

However , I suggest also talking to your child about hand washing and flu prevention measures . He or she may just follow the lead of the adult , and good sanitation ca n't hurt . More than likely , however , his or her teachers are aware of community wide diligence and have already been instructed on precautionary measures during this critical time . <p> 5 .

Of course , doctors also highly recommend getting the H1N1 vaccine as soon as it becomes available . <p> While it is virtually impossible to completely avoid human touch and physical interaction , the extent to which you touch another person , albeit a handshake , hug or kiss is based on your personal feelings , health and good judgment . Even during this highly charged state of medical alert , for many , refusing a handshake still sends a powerful message to the other person . Before you refuse a handshake , make sure you are ready to pay the price for insulting a client or offending your beloved grandmother while shunning her hugs and kisses . 113805 @qwx733805

Quiet : With all the schedules , parenting obligations , work demands , and more , you may find it difficult to explore your own thoughts . If you step away from the usual rigors of motherhood for just 30 minutes and allow your mind to wander , you can give yourself a break from prioritizing and planning . Sometimes we just need to be quiet and allow ourselves to just be . Find a time in your daily life when you can arrange absolute quiet . Take a hot bath and close your eyes ; enjoy the silence and allow your thoughts to drift in nonsensical directions . <p> 2 .

Intention : " Me " time is the key to starting your day off right . The promise of a new day begins with the sunrise . Set your alarm , get up before everyone else and stretch . Grab a cup of coffee and sit on your porch ; enjoy the sounds of morning as you clear your mind . This will help you set the pace for the day and decide that the day is going to be great .

Giving is a major part of being a mom , and it takes great peace to do that successfully every single day . <p> 6 . Plan : If you allow yourself some " me " time , you can plan ahead for the day . If you know your daughter has soccer practice , you can create a plan to get her to that practice without feeling like you 're juggling too much at one time .

Emotions : No matter what , do n't  allow yourself to become numb to your surroundings in your fast-paced , demanding life . A mothers love is all encompassing , and if you 're spreading yourself too thin , great opportunities to show it are missed . Many times after the occasion is passed , we think of the things we should have said or done . As mothers , we must make time for our emotions or we will miss out on a great deal life has to offer .

Be considerate of your stepchildren but do n't  expect too much too fast . Let the children get to know you and observe through your actions that you are interested and committed to building a relationship . <p> 2 . Let your stepchildren know that it is not your intention to alter the relationship they currently enjoy with their dad or mom or to change their daily routines . Make it a point to try and " fit in " to their schedule rather than having them adjust their lives to fit into yours .

You may emphasize that the family rules are for their safety and protection , but be careful not to overstep your boundaries by laying down the law before you have developed any relationship with your stepchild . Decide what your role is in advance if a rule is broken and the adult in chargeif not both . In this family-friendly conversation , your spouse should communicate what rights he or she expects you to have when enforcing the rules . <p> 4 .

Make every effort to stay neutral when conflict arises between your spouse and his or her former mate . Also , steer clear from negative conversation about the ex with other parents that may want to get you caught up in the gossip you may have missed . It is easy to go down that road , especially if your relationship with the ex is contentious , but do n't  do it .

Allow your stepchildren to talk openly about their mom or dad . Your stepchildren should feel free to discuss their time away from you , which includes what they do when they are not with you and your spouse .

" <p> " When in doubt who will win , be neutral . " Swiss Proverb <p> One of my husbands most reliable responses to my often high level of emotionality is , " Can you just be neutral ? " <p> He is a psychiatrist , so he has a lot more practice at finding a neutral objective view .

The study included 120 couples who reported being in satisfactory marriages from between one and 50 years . They were asked to recall the worst conflict they had over the past four months . Half the group was also asked to write a short story about their recent arguments from the perspective of a neutral third party who would want the best for both spouses . This additional seven-minute assignment of intentionally pulling ones perspective towards a neutral , even-tempered view of ones relationship and its inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the marriage over years . <p> Learning how to not make things worse , how to experience conflict with a patient and open heart are true markers of maturity . Many people grow up never learning these fundamental building blocks of relating .

Just seven minutes of witnessing and recording your arguments from the perspective of someone neutral who wants the best for you , your spouse and your relationship is all the attention required to strengthen intimacy and connection for years afterward . Retelling your story from a neutral , compassionate perspective actually adds another voice in your head , a more mature voice that is seeking the best outcome for all . <p> The study also showed that this technique is less helpful for relationships that are already skewed angry and negative , so the earlier you make room for a neutral and kind observer to your more painful relationship moments , the better . In positivity terms , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your view of yourself and your marriage . Most of us are already gifted at kindness towards others , so this practice of objective story telling about the places we get stuck , helps us grow into the relationships we aspire to . <p> This storytelling device does not eradicate your initial emotional response , but through the practice of including a neutral voice , we are drawn closer to the middle , where we have more space and time to find the responses to conflict that promote growth and not destruction . <p> So , in the name of discovering and cultivating the love that is already surrounding you , start by asking yourself or someone you lovemy psychiatrist husbands favorite question " Can you just be neutral here ? " Tell yourself and anyone else who will listen , a kinder and more neutral story about a recent conflict . Better still , write it down in a book titled , " Skills for Loving .

Is it because of too much sex ? I love my wife and want to satisfy her . I am very attracted to her and we both have a high sex drive . Please advise .

That should help with keeping your erection and slow down your breathing until you have your ejaculation response under control . Alternating slow and then faster thrusts will be a great sexual give and take . Pay attention to your body as you learn how to control your ejaculation . <p> Lastly , if you answered " yes " to any of the questions above you have set yourself up for negatively affecting your sexual response .

" <p> She did , and his computer jumped to display his favorite picture of her , the one from the beach in Hawaii with her laughing , holding her sunhat on with one hand and adjusting the top of her bikini with the other . <p> " Look in ' Work Documents , ' " he was saying . " Its called ' New Proposal . ' " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relief . Thought maybe I deleted it or something . Okay . Thanks . Be home late probably . Got to finish here . Love you .

The company liked him . He was being promoted . She noticed a folder with a funny name . " Craigslist Sales , " it said . Oh , Jennifer thought , I did n't  know he was selling stuff on Craigslist . She opened it . The files inside were named with what seemed to be dates . She opened 070511 . It began , " Bi curious ? Meet to talk and maybe more . " And there was contact information . Jennifer couldnt believe what she was reading . She opened another . " Find gay , bi , curious guys for free near you with Grindr on your iPhone " She opened others .

" It was signed , " Your alpha top , Brad . " It was dated yesterday . <p> Jennifer was waiting for Tom when he got home that night at 8:00 . She had printed out all the files in the " Craigslist Sales " folder . She had printed out all the e-mails from Brad . She sat in the living room , hugging these papers to her chest as if they were a comfort rather than a torment . She had been crying for hours , but now she was all cried out . <p> Toms usual " What 's for supper ? " greeting died on his lips when he saw her sitting , red-eyed with her mouth a grim hard line . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This , " she replied , and threw the papers at him . He picked up one sheet and glanced at it , lost his easy smile , and sat down across from her . <p> " I was going to tell you , " he said . " I did n't  mean to be sneaking around . " <p> Tom looked stricken . " Of course not . I 'm not gay . I love you . Were going to have a child , a family " <p> " You 're not gay ? Youve been seeing this Brad character . Having an affair . Youve been having sex with him . " <p> " No , " Tom said . " I did meet with him , but we did n't  have sex . " <p> " Thats not what these e-mails say .

It was just ' fooling around . ' What kind of stupid does he think I am ? He says he loves me and does n't  want to leave me . How can I believe a word he says ? He s been lying to me .

" <p> " So , you think he s not telling the truth ? " <p> " He s never been a liar , " Jennifer admitted . " I think he s confused . Soon hell realize he s gay , and then that will be that , and I 'll be left with a baby and no husband . I was going to quit my job and go to Ann Arbor . " Her voice turned hard .

And not quit my job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " He could be telling the truth , " I said . " He probably is confused , but he might not be gay . You might be able to save your marriage . " <p> She fixed me with her schoolteacher no-nonsense look . " Can you explain that ? " she asked . <p> " If a man has a gay identity if he s born gay then to feel right about himself he needs to socialize with other gay men . He s turned on by men .

" <p> " It can seem that way , but we can sort it out . Do you think I could talk with Tom ? " <p> Tom might be a straight man who is drawn to have sex with men , or he might be gay . What 's the difference , and why does it matter to Jennifers marriage ? <p> What it means to be gay is misunderstood by almost everyone . This is partly because of the confusion caused by political and religious prejudices , but it is also because the human body-and-soul partnership is complex and subtle and difficult to understand , even by honest and unbiased investigators . What does it mean for a man to be gay ? <p> The answer to this question is important if you 're a woman connected to a man who is drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay , then it is going to be difficult for you to have a functional marriage . Not impossible , but difficult . ( See chapter 13 on mixed-orientation marriages . ) On the other hand , if he is not gay , then that 's not the case . If he s not gay , and he and you want to have a marriage that works , then the chances are you can . <p> Some men are straight , some are gay , and some are in between . I 'm going to spend some time describing " gay " now , and well consider the others later . <p> No one thing that a man does makes him gay . Its important to keep this in mind . <p> To be gay , a man must have gay sexual fantasies and be drawn to gay sexual behaviors ; demonstrate a gay erotic desire ; have gay romantic hopes , dreams , and behaviors ; and have a gay identity . Each of these four aspects involves a set of behaviors and needs . A gay man will be strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . <p> Let 's consider each of them . Having gay sexual fantasies or behaviors means imagining sex between men or engaging in sex between men . It should not be necessary to list which acts are sexual and which are not , but many people make arbitrary and illogical distinctions , partly because of legal , moral , or religious considerations . Let 's agree that " sex " includes any sort of sexual activity with the understanding that we have not tried here to clarify , such things as the difference between a sexual kiss and a nonsexual one . <p> What is " gay erotic desire ? " Imagine a man is walking on the beach . Scantily clad people of both genders are there . Whom does he notice ? A gay man will notice the men . The women might as well not be there . ( A straight man will notice the women and not see the men . ) This reaction is deeply programmed . Its as if a gay mans sexual soul is wired directly to his eyes , and unless he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he s a policeman and he s on the lookout for a female criminalthe men will overwhelm his visual circuits . He ca n't help it . Its automatic . This " beach test " is telling for gay men and for straight men , because a mans sexuality is strongly visual . <p> One variant of the beach test is " youthful noticing . " A gay man often will tell me that as a prepubescent boy , he was noticing with pleasure other boys his age , often without any sense that this noticing was sexual or romantic . Straight men never tell me this . <p> " Some men are straight , some are gay , and some are in between . " <p> Let 's pause here , so I can go on the record about something : As I describe various characteristics of the aspects of gayness , it may sometimes sound like an uncomfortable echo of the cruel homophobic game of " catching " someone who is gay by his " non-masculine " appearance or behavior . Not that gay men tend to be particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with being gay . I am happily gay myself . It is also okay to be a straight man with soft or " feminine " characteristics , behaviors , or interests . As we differentiate straight from gay and in between , as we consider various aspects and characteristics , ultimately only the man himself can decide if he is gay . Although he should usually inform the people close to him , for his sake as well as theirs , and try not to make false promises or tell lies , his sexual orientation is fundamentally his business and not the business of nosy or nasty strangers . <p> Sometimes a man who is essentially straight has a compulsion to fantasize about , watch porn about , or act out sex scenes with men . A common reason for this is that he has experienced certain kinds of childhood abuse or neglect . ( Well look at other reasons , too , in chapter 16 . ) When a straight male client tells me he has a history of compulsively and repeatedly acting out specific sexual scenarios with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was ( for example ) sexually abused by a male relative , a teacher , or a priest . The repetitive compulsion is caused by my clients need to " overcome " the bad feelings from his abuse . ( This development of " core sexual scripts " from abuse or neglect is explained in detail in chapter 11 . ) Usually , with therapy , the force of the compulsion can be diminished or eliminated . I 've also had male clients compulsively and repeatedly seek the comforting arms of men , and they will trade sex for this comfort . A " father hunger " we discover in therapyis often driven by extreme childhood neglect , and again the force of the compulsion can be diminished through therapy . Although therapy allows these men to reclaim control over their lives and have successful marriages , the urge of the acting-out behaviors or fantasies rarely goes away entirely . It is deeply encoded in their psyches . <p> A gay man who is not a victim of such childhood abuse has the desire to express his sexuality with men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes be interested in a quick sex act with little personal interaction , but he is also capable of appreciating and enjoying a male partner in more full and loving ways . He thinks men are wonderful . He is capable of gay romance . <p> We all know what romance is . You hold hands . You look goofy-eyed at your lover , and he looks goofy-eyed back . You kiss . You fantasize about the house you 'll furnish together , the trip to Paris you 'll take together , the way you 'll grow old together . You want a partner who cuddles you in the morning , calls you at noon just to say " I love you , " and tells you over supper what you are thinking before you say it yourself . A typical gay manat least , if he s given a chance to become comfortable with his gayness and a few years to transition through " gay adolescence " will long to find a partner he can be romantic with . He will brave the stormy seas of romantic thrills and heartaches seeking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men do not do this with men . The tendency of gay men to develop their gay romantic side is natural for them , but straight men , even straight men who have sought sexual relations with men , even straight men who have tried to live a gay life , never do . <p> " When a straight male client tells me he has a history of compulsively and repeatedly acting out specific sexual scenarios with other men , I expect to discover in therapy that he was ( for example ) sexually abused by a male relative , a teacher , or a priest . " <p> Beyond sex , desire , and romance is the deep and important mystery of identity . We all understand identity at some level . We identify with our family , the schools we 've attended , our country , our religion , our ethnic origins . " I am one of those Smiths . " " I 'm a Bulldog . " " I 'm a Polish American . " But as important as these and other cultural and racial identifications can be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called sexual orientation . That word " sexual " is misleading . A persons sexual identity is not just about sex . It is more like a tribal identity than a signifier of sexual preferences . An honest celibate gay priest has no sex life , or romantic life either , but he knows he s gay . <p> Is Your Man Gay ? <p> I will summarize here some of the key observations I make when a man comes to me confused and questioning his sexual identity . Although what follows is fairly straightforward , it is sometimes difficult for men to know where they stand . Their confusion has two major sources . First , I 've already noted our cultures traditional prejudice against gays and gayness . Men sometimes do n't  want to know they 're gay . They fear being hated for their identity . Who can blame them ? Second , severe abuse or neglect in childhood can lead to sexual compulsions that confuse the truth of a mans identity . Generally , the man must undergo a course of therapy to remove the layers of confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach test . Gay men notice the men on a beach and do n't  notice the women . " That man is hot ! " a gay man might say . In my experience , straight men , even those who have sex with men , do n't  react this way . <p> 2 . Youthful noticing . This is the childrens version of the beach test . Before puberty , gay boys notice with a kind of giggling delight other boys , just as straight boys do girls . This is a perfectly natural expression of prepubescent identity that straight boys in our society typically get to share out loud with their peers and gay boys typically do not . Gay men often report to me memories of youthful noticing of boys ; straight men never do . Gay men will often say they did n't  know what it meant at the time , but they recall being strongly drawn to another boy their age or preoccupied with another male on television . Only looking back can these gay men understand that their interest was romantic and sexual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wake up next to , a man or a woman ? Some straight guys will kiss and hug other men and so forth , but they still do n't  want to wake up next to a man . Something is just " off-putting " to a straight guy about the morning light on a face full of stubble . <p> 4 . Falling in love . No matter how much quick or anonymous sex a gay man might have engaged in , he loves everything about other men : their faces , their chest hair , their deep voices , their humor , their penises . A straight man who has sex with other men ( or has fantasies about it or watches gay porn ) is most often compulsively focused on certain male body parts or on certain sex acts or sexual scenarios . A gay man yearns for an entire man , not just parts of a man . Gay men canand often dofall in romantic love with other men ; straight men never do . <p> " Gay men find gay sex fundamentally joyful , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a male partner . After a period of promiscuous " gay adolescence , " which will occur typically for a few years after a gay man comes out , he will tend to mature beyond a frantic need to express his newfound sexual freedom and yearn to " settle down " with a loving male partner . <p> 6 . Gay sex not degrading . Out gay men do n't  feel degraded by their sexuality . Straight men sometimes interpret gay sex as humiliating . For some religious moralists , the core of their objection to homosexuality is a repugnance for dehumanizing acts . However , gay men find gay sex fundamentally joyful , not degrading . <p> 7 . Homophobia . Gay men unconscious of their gayness are much more homophobic than are straight men who have sex with men . Straight men who are confused and questioning come into my office and say , " I do n't  think I 'm gay , but I might be . If I 'm gay , help me just go ahead and come out and be gay . " These men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming-out process . <p> If a gay man is repressing his gay identity , he is often extremely negative about gay people and the " gay lifestyle . " He might complain that gay life is over-sexualized , gays are too effeminate , and gay men never have successful relationships . In therapy , these homophobic gay men hope the therapist will make them straight , not help them come out as gay . <p> This chapter has considered the marriage between Tom and Jennifer mainly from Jennifers point of view .

" <p> Unless you are living in an isolated cave , social conflict is inevitable . Our needs , interests , and desires collide with each other , getting in the way of our happiness . <p> Conflict is not inherently bad , however . We need conflict to teach us , entertain us , and help us grow . We can probably do without Jerry Springers craziness , but a certain amount of conflict is healthy . On the other hand , we also experience unhealthy conflict ; when the conflict becomes chronic and repetitive , it is toxic . <p> Worse , emerging research shows that toxic conflict kills just as surely as cancer , heart disease , or diabetes . Recent studies reveal that frequent arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a doubling to tripling in the risk of death from any cause .

We are afraid of vulnerability , exploitation , being hurt , being betrayed , and all of the other ugly things that relationships can cause . The secret is not to ask for safety , but to create safety around you . You do n't  have to be a dish mop to do this . In fact , creating a safe space is empowering . If others feel safe around you , the likelihood of toxic conflict goes to zero . You create safety by example .

So , when there are no arguments in your marriage , it may very well be that the two of you do n't  feel comfortable enough with one another to have a disagreement . <p> As a relationships expert in the public eye , I see one of my roles as helping to enlighten you as to the accurate information about you and your mate .

If I can help you with greater understanding , you will hopefully share a much more satisfying life with one another . <p> Unexpected Problems <p> So , why do I say that conflicts are bound to happen in your relationship ? If you think about it , it really does make sense . When you 're involved with someone regularly and that someone is a person with whom you are close , your emotions get entangled . When something problematic arises , emotions are likely to get triggered . Accompanying your emotions will also be a bodily reaction because your body is designed to help you deal with stress . So , at the very least , when you experience negative emotions , hormones will be released . <p> Some of you do n't  feel comfortable expressing your feelings ( or do n't  do so properly ) .

" <p> Have you ever been frustrated when your husband did n't  clean the kitchen the way you would have , or when your wife put your tools away in the wrong drawers so you could n't find them ? Perhaps you even shake your head thinking that your spouse just does n't  " get it " sometimes ? This can be a natural conclusion since men and women generally think differentlya man might not see the socks on the floor on his way back to the garage to finish an important project just as a woman may not finish her project right away because she notices the socks on the floor and then the dishes in the sink . <p> I 've talked to numerous couples whom have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find their spouses not coming through . One woman , Amy , complained to me that her husband , Jerry , started to bring his laptop to the dinner table to finish some work from the office . She was deeply hurt by this , as she always looked forward to their quality time at dinner to catch up from the day and re-connect . When I asked her if she brought this to Jerrys attention to explain how much she looked forward to spending quality time with him at dinner , she through her arms up and said , " AbsolutelyIve brought it up three times , and he just seems to get upset every time ! " Then I asked her what she said to him , wondering to myself why Jerry would be so upset when she told him how much she loved spending time with him . When she revealed the words she used to propose more quality time at dinner it became very clear why it turned into a fight over and over again . <p> The Wrong Response and 4 Steps to Turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry , you are always on that computerwhen are going to turn it off ? At least turn it off at the dinner table . " Amy grew very upset just remembering the incident and could n't understand how Jerry did n't  know that bringing his laptop to the dinner table was a big no-no . After helping Amy calm down , I shared four steps to use when asking for what she wants that changed everything for her . <p> 1 . Notice the behavior : Identify the concrete actions without evaluating or judging your spouse as stupid or purposely acting against you ( i.e. He brought the laptop to the dinner table . He did n't  say , " I do n't  care about you . " ) . Ask yourself , " Could there be a good reason for this behavior ? " <p> 2 . Get clear on your expectations : What are you expecting your spouse to know or do in that situation ? How does it make you feel and what do you think about them when they do n't  respond the way you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read your mind about your expectations no matter how much you think you give good clues . <p> 3 . Request what you need clearly and state why it is important to you : Request a concrete action that can be carried out in the present moment ( i.e. " When I see that you have n't taken out the trash , I feel stressed because I like to have a clean-smelling kitchen and the trash stinks when its full . I know you might be focused on something else and may not notice it . Would you be willing to take the trash out for me when I remind you that its full ? " Or " When I see you shopping a lot , I get very stressed out because I pay the bills and I know we are on a limited budget . Would you be willing to talk to me before you buy things so we can figure out a way to make it work with our monthly expenses ? ) <p> 4 . Offer appreciation for their efforts : We all like to be appreciated do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if someone put fuel in our tank . When your spouse has answered your request or even attempted to give you what you need , be sure to give appreciation for their efforts . They will want to do whatever it takes to get more of that next time ( i.e. " Thank you for taking out the trash ! The kitchen smells great and I feel so at peace now ! " Or , " Thank you for checking in with me before you bought those shoes . We have a surplus in our budget for this months expenses . I ca n't wait to see you in your new shoes ! " ) <p> Amy learned to ask specifically for what she wants and she realized that what is obvious to her is n't always obvious to her husband . Using these four steps helped her acknowledge and appreciate how hard Jerry was working , and how he felt attacked for his hard work when she asked him to turn off his laptop . Instead , she expressed how much she loved connecting with him at dinner and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I know you probably have so much work to catch up on , but is there any way you might be able to finish it after dinner ? I 've missed you today and would love to have a moment to connect with you . " I remember the next day , Amy called with joy and excitement in her voice and exclaimed , " Guess what ? ! Jerry and I enjoyed an amazing dinner last night , and he told me all about this new project he s working on at work that he s excited about . I got to share with him the plans I want to make for our summer vacation this year ! We have n't connected like that in a long time ! " She mentioned that Jerry did n't  realize how important dinner time was to her . Once she asked him specifically for what she wanted , he was willing to give her that time .

Often times , couples take their significant other for granted due to their busy and hectic schedules . Husbands and wives tend to forget that their relationship needs regular attention and maintenance . Here are six tips to bring intimacy back into your relationship . <p> How to Bring Zest Back Into Your Marriage:1 . No one ever said marriage is easy , and many of us forget that once you commit to a relationship , you must be dedicated to it . A marriage is similar to many aspects of life that take effort and time . Just like an accomplished student puts in the extra work to achieve an A in class or a post-graduate hones their skills to be the top in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skills required to have a good relationship . You can start by committing to changing negative behaviors , especially those which result from falling into a comfortable routine . Although difficult at first , it is worth the reward in the long run to have a stronger and more open marriage . <p> 2 . There was a reverend in Texas who recently challenged married parishioners to have sex every day for seven days straight . This is a wonderful way to light a fire under couples that have let intimacy fall to the wayside . Keep in mind , I 'm not saying that you have to have sex every day , but making a conscious effort to set specific date nights is a wonderful way to keep the fire going . Also , making sure your date nights are without distraction will better allow you and your spouse to enjoy one anotherso turn off the TV and cell phone ! <p> 3 . I have a good friend who confided that with three children she and her husband never have the privacy they prefer , so every morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate space . They understood how important it is to make time to have intimacy and closeness with one another , even if it meant getting up earlier and thinking of creative ways to do it . <p> 4 . You and your partner should both write down five things that she or he used to do that you miss about one another . For example , you could write down , " I always like it when you come home from work and surprise me with a kiss " ( as opposed to the habit he may have now , such as throwing his coat on the couch and going straight for the remote ) . Exchange each others wish lists and make an effort to fulfill them . No wish is too big or small ; even the little things count , like showing appreciation by thanking your spouse for cooking dinner ! <p> 5 . Spice things up with thoughtful surprises . Instead of going out , hire a babysitter and plan a nice evening at home . Low on cash ? There are plenty of caring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note in your partners car or on their pillow . <p> 6 .

@@79604923 @1104923/ <p> These days , many of us are weighing the impacts and ethics of meat eating in general . So the prospect of buying and cooking a holiday roast is more daunting than ever . Here 's a guide to navigating todays meat markets and making a centerpiece roast worth celebrating . <p> Source Quality Beef <p> The single most important decision to make is what beef to buy , because flavor is largely predetermined before the roast goes into the oven . Quality beef is strongly correlated with the cattles quality of life : Did it live on pasture , even during its final 120 days eating grasses ? Did it live without stressespecially right before slaughter ? Other considerations include the animals age at the time of slaughter ( the current thinking is that older animals yield tastier meat ) and how the meat was aged ( dry aging is preferred over wet aging ) and for how long . <p> In other words , the source is central , and an organic or grass-fed label alone is n't enough information to go on . Although some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sustainable producers , ranchers in every state sell their beef directly to customers either at the farmers market or online . And even if you ca n't find locally raised beef , some of the most acclaimed producers in the country , such as White Oak Pastures and Alderspring Ranch , can ship a roast straight to you . <p> Spend Carefully , Eat Consciously <p> Of course , you 'll spend far more for humanely treated , pasture-raised and well-aged beef . But for a number of reasonsincluding concerns about animal welfare , environmental impacts and healthmost experts today agree we should all be buying the best meat and eating less of it in any case . Plan on 4 to 6 ounces of cooked roast beef per person , then load up on side dishes : roasted or pureed vegetables and winter salads not only balance the plate visually and nutritionally but help reduce costs per serving . A stuffed and rolled roast is another strategy that also offers high presentation value . <p> Tenderloin is the old standard , known for its tenderness more than its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensivecuts , from bone-in rib roast to strip loin , that help support small , independent ranchers who need to sell whole animals , not just a single popular beef cut . This year consider the holiday roast beef from a whole-animal perspective , and you may discover a new favorite . here 's a list of five roasts I recommend , along with general cooking information . <p> Roasting Techniques <p> There are three essential steps to roast beef : seasoning with salt , cooking to the correct temperature and resting . Generously salting a well-sourced piece of meat 24 to 48 hours before cooking it is the only advance preparation required . Meanwhile , you can concentrate on determining the best roasting temperature for your chosen cut . <p> The classic high-heat roasting methodputting the roast in the oven at 425 F , for example , and then reducing the heat to finish cookingis not ideal for less tender cuts like sirloin tip and top round . Slower roasting at 350 F and below ensures more even , controlled cooking for all types of cuts . You might also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverse-sear technique : cooking the roast at a low temperature and then blasting the heat for the last 10 minutes . <p> The rest is actually the final stage of cooking . Factor in an extra 30 minutes and reserve counter space to let the cooked roast sit undisturbed . While you finish preparing the rest of the meal , the meat will reach its final temperatureoften at least 10 degrees higher than when you removed it from the ovenand the juices will redistribute through the roast . <p> Roasting Tools <p> You 've heard before that a thermometer is essential for roasting beef . This is because you can not determine doneness just by sight , as I painfully learned the year I roasted an 8-pound top round to an even gray-brown for my entire family ! Temperature tells all . <p> There are handy , inexpensive probe models with alarms , though I depend on the pricey but lightning-quick Thermapen .

But remember , discipline is n't only about correction . Discipline is also about teaching kids to control themselves and care about others so they can grow up to be productive members of society . Here are some approaches you can use to help your kids do just that : <p> 1 . Be firm . Set reasonable limits , explain them , and enforce them . <p> 2 . Be consistent .

Compromise . Kids ca n't always tell the difference between big and little issues . So give in on a few small things once in a while ( an extra piece of birthday cake at the end of a long day might avoid a tantrum ) . That will give the child a feeling of control and will make it easier for him to go along with the program on the bigger issues ( holding hands while crossing the street , for example ) . <p> 5 . Give choices . Kathryn Kvols , author of " Redirecting Children 's Behavior , " suggests , for example , that if your child is yanking all the books off a shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like to stop knocking the books off the shelf or would you like to go to your room ?

If the child knows the rules ( at this age , all you have to do is ask ) , impose the promised consequences immediately .

Once the punishment is over ( and whatever it is it should n't last any more than a minute per year of age ) , get back to your life . There 's no need to review , summarize , or make sure the child got the point . <p> 10 . Stay calm .

When your talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be big enough that he 'll know who the boss is . <p> 12 . Do n't lecture .

" <p> 13 . Criticize the behavior , not the child . Even such seemingly innocuous comments as , " I 've told you a thousand times ... " or " Every single time you ... " gives the child the message that he 's doomed to disappointing you no matter what he does . <p> 14 . Reinforce positive behavior . We spend so much time criticizing negatives and not enough time complimenting the positives . Heartfelt comments like , " I 'm so proud of you when I see you cleaning up your toys , " go a long way . <p> 15 . Play games .

Oh , dear . " <p> Have you heard of The 12 Nights of Christmas , also known as Secret Santa ( not to be confused with secret gift exchanges ) ? I came across this concept years ago while reading " In Search of the Real Spirit of Christmas " by Dan Schaeffer . In the back was a chapter describing his family tradition modeled after the 12 days of Christmas . Beginning on December 13 and ending on Christmas Eve , the family left a treat along with a cute poem on a neighbor 's porch every evening . The whole idea was to teach kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twelve nights sneaking around the neighborhood playing ding dong ditch ? How fun ! I especially loved the idea of helping my kids learn the joys of giving at such an impressionable age . And so that December gave birth to a new family tradition for the Fells . <p> Now our oldest daughter was away at college and our teenage son was busy with high school activities , so that left our two youngest as Santas . As I explained what we were embarking on and why , they were thrilled with the idea of sneaking around the neighborhood for any reason . At age 10 , our daughter much preferred to be an elf as she was female and Santa was , well , male . But with her 8-year-old brother as Santa , an elf 's superior , that would n't do either . To keep the village peace , we became elves instead of Santas . <p> As a family of six , we were on a budget . Armed with a shopping list , my first stop was our local dollar store . Thankfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking home our supplies , we got to work printing the poems and preparing the bags while the kids giggled at the notion of 12 nights of mischief over Christmas vacation . <p> It was already December , and the first night was fast approaching . Fairly new to the neighborhood , we discussed who should be the lucky neighbor . A couple months earlier , I heard that Neighbor Tom had lost his wife to cancer . She was well loved by all who knew her , and I could n't imagine what the holidays must be like for Tom and their two children . To my mind , it was clear that Toms home could use small doses of nightly cheer . The kids quickly agreed , and the matter was settled . <p> On the evening of December 13 , my two elves giggled nervously as we bundled up and headed out into the night . Sneaking through the quiet snow-filled streets of our neighborhood with a flashlight was as magical for the kids as it was for me ; I treasured our memories in the making . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , deserted streets were at night . It was like another world waited for us each eveninga peaceful , enchanting winter wonderland that could only be experienced on foot . The magic was heightened when the kids giggled over my clumsiness in the dark . Note to self : Get more flashlights . <p> Upon returning home from our adventure each evening , we warmed our hands around a mug of hot cocoa , and warmed our hearts around the whim that our nightly surprises might bring cheer to Tom 's family . <p> The next eleven nights flew by and soon it was Christmas Eve , the 12th day when we had to reveal our identity . I suddenly became nervous . I had never actually met Tom , and worried that maybe our nightly gifts had been a bit too much for the family 's fragile emotions . But there was no backing down now ; we had to finish . That afternoon we arranged a dozen homemade treats on a small holiday plate , covered it with red plastic wrap , taped the final poem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a plate of goodieswe drove to Toms house .

Realizing I was on my own and because my children say Im tone deaf , I quickly decided that one verse was more than enough for this poor family . <p> As soon as I stopped singing I realized that Tom and his two children had tears in their eyes ! Oh , dear . Was my voice that bad , or was our entire mission just one big flop ? <p> Quickly , I decided the best way to handle this was to explain that we were the Little Elves responsible for the nightly treats , and then leave the poor family alone . After all , it was Christmas Eve and here we were intruding on their fragile emotions . <p> But I soon discovered that I had nothing to fear at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little gifts , and now it was coming to an end ! It turns out that Tom and his children not only enjoyed the element of surprise , but the nightly anticipation was a wonderful respite from the constant sadness , and lifted their spirits . Mission accomplished ! <p> That first year proved a wonderful experience and we continued the tradition , choosing a different neighbor each year , until tragedy struck our own family . In 2009 , my 15-year-old elf , Aly , died in a car accident while coming home from a swim meet . Caught in my own fog of grief , I had no reserve left in my tank to carry on our family fun with our youngest . With a broken heart , our once beloved tradition came to an unexpected end . <p> In the years since losing Aly , in fits and starts our family has learned to laugh and feel joy again , but I 've never forgotten how bleak those first holidays felt . <p> I 've also learned that helping others helps my own heart to heal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elfreinstating the old family tradition will offer both giver and receiver a nightly dose of good cheer , and enrich our holidays in magical ways just as it did in years past .

Having faced loss since then , I now fully understand how the holidays can feel less than cheery , and how a little kindness can go a long way .

@@79604929 @1104929/ <p> Every year you can count on countless little angels and funny little cowboys ringing your doorbell on the eve of October 31st . There are certain courtesies that should be observed and are certainly worth a friendly reminder . <p> Trick or Treat Tips for Parents <p> Think twice before carting around a " party wagon " filled with liquor for your trick or treat travels . The emphasis should be on the kids when it 's dark and your children are dressed up and running from house to house . Parents are often distracted by the red wagon filled with chilled margaritas and often let their children get too far ahead of them while they are socializing and pouring their next drink . <p> Before leaving the house , take a close look at your child 's costume and make sure it fits properly . If your child is wearing a mask , ensure your child 's vision will not be impaired when he or she is running around the neighborhood . A good pair of tennis shoes is the best choice for footwear . <p> Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat march . Your child should be reminded to watch for cars , stay close to an adult and say thank you at each house , regardless of whether or not he likes the candy treat . <p> While a tiny baby , dressed up in costume is so very cute , a parent or child carrying a large plastic pumpkin and expecting to collect candy for this toothless little infant is a bit forward . The rule is , if he ca n't walk or chew solid food , he does n't need a bucket full of tootsie rolls and taffy . <p> When possible , acknowledge the person at the door handing your child a treat . While it 's an expected gesture for your child to thank the person handing out candy , it 's extra nice to hear it from a parent as well . <p> If your teen plans to trick or treat , make sure they do not wear a mask or any kind of costume that would appear threatening or dangerous . The rule of thumb is , generally after the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing out candy instead . <p> If you do not want to participate in trick or treat , simply put your light off or go out for a nice dinner . It 's rather nerve wrecking sitting in your house and trying to ignore the festivities going on outside your door . <p> Do n't allow your child to open and eat any candy until it has been thoroughly inspected by you . Make it very clear to your kids that the golden rule is , " Thou shall not eat any treats until inspected by mom or dad . " <p> Trick or Treat Tips for Kids <p> Be considerate of your neighbors flowerbeds and decorative planters . Stay off and away from anything that can bend , break or get ruined . Nothing changes the festive mood faster than damaging someone 's property . <p> If the porch light is off , keep walking . Do not walk up to a door that is not lit and if the light is on but no one answers the door after two rings , continue on your trick or treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step out of the way and allow other children room to receive their treat . If you are waiting for your friends , do so away from the front door or porch . <p> You may not ask for " seconds " nor may you ask to exchange a treat for something else in the basket . It is impolite to voice your disdain for the candy de jour . <p> Carry a flashlight , wear reflective clothing and do not run across the street . Cross over to another street at the corner or crosswalks . <p> If someone invites you in their home , do not enter unless accompanied by a trusted adult . If there is a haunted house in someone 's home , it is a good idea to go in with someone you know . <p> Go to the restroom before you leave the house . Stay close enough to home that you can quickly visit your own restroom rather than asking someone if you can use theirs . <p> Always smile and thank the person giving you a treat . Neighbors appreciate children who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work parents . <p> Commonly Asked Trick or Treat Questions <p> If my child needs to go to the restroom , may I ask a neighbor to borrow their bathroom ? Preferably not . It is best to take care of business at home , especially if you do not know the family you are asking . If you do ask , go in with your child and make sure his shoes are clean before traipsing through their house . Always leave the restroom as clean or cleaner than you found it . <p> What kind of treats are the least favorite ? Anything that includes an apple or other fruit ( such as raisins ) is not high on a kid 's treat list . Pencils , loose coins , cheap artificial chocolate and bookmarks do n't make the cut either . <p> What do kids like to get in their treat bag ? Popcorn balls , good quality candy bars , sour candy and jolly ranchers seem to be quite popular , based on my unscientific neighborhood poll . <p> Are there certain costumes to stay away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversial ( nun , priest , devil , belly dancer ) or that can be seen as suggestive or sexual . That goes for parents as well . If parents are going to dress up to take kids trick or treating , keep the costume G-rated . <p> How much candy should I give out ? Two to three small candies is the norm , or one full size candy bar . <p> What time is appropriate to shut off the lights ? When Halloween falls on a weekday ( a school night ) , a good time to close up shop is between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m . Take in your fresh pumpkins just in case someone wants to play an after hour trick on you ! 113805 @qwx733805

" <p> Breakdown of communication is the number one cause of the start of relationship problems that I see in my therapy practice . The term , " communication , " is used so loosely that most people do n't  even know what it means . They know they do n't  have it , they want to get it , but they do n't  know how to do it . <p> What is my definition of " good communication ? " It is a message that you send verbally to your partner who then receives it , acknowledges what you 've said , and understands it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is open to miscommunication , misinterpretations , and assumptions , which equal frustration , resentment , and distancing . <p> Below Are the ABCs of Good Communication : <p> 1 . Speak clearly , succinctly , and nicely . The clearer you speak and say what you feel , the more likely your spouse will hear what you 're saying and respond clearly in return . In normal , everyday conversations , instead of saying , " I cant believe you still have n't taken out the garbage , " say , " I 'd appreciate it if you 'd take out the garbage tonight . " For communications regarding more major issues , instead of saying , " Oh my gosh , work was so horrible . We need to talk now , " say , " I had a hard day at work and I 'd really like to talk about it . When do you have time ? " <p> 2 . Be a good listener . Clear your mind of your own stuff while your spouse is talking to you so you can put yourself in their shoes and respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say next . A sign that you 're being a good listener is when you 're not interrupting your partner or thinking about something else while they 're speaking . And you know you 're being listened to when two things happen : ( 1 ) your partner asks questionsnot by interrogatingbut with curiosity to help them understand what you 're saying ; and ( 2 ) you can say to your spouse , " Yes , you 've got it . That 's exactly what I was saying . " <p> 3 . Use " I " statements . " I " statements are a clear way to communicate , because rather than blaming them by saying , " You always do this , " you 're telling your spouse how you feel . " You " statements end up feeling like an attack , and the only way your partner can respond is by defending himself . For example , " I feel sad because we argue all the time , " rather than saying , " Youre always out to hurt me . " This statement conveys that you 're taking responsibility for your own feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . Checking it out . A good way to have clear communication is to check out with your spouse what he/she heard you say and vice-versa . That way you can see if your message was received correctly to avoid the recipient making the wrong assumption about the message . For example , I would say to my spouse , " What did you hear ? " Then my husband would feed back to me what I said . If that 's not what I said , I 'd repeat it again until Im satisfied that my husband has heard me , and vice-versa . Remember , you 're just trying to make clear communication , not criticize each others speaking or listening skills . <p> 5 . Have patience . Be patient with yourself and your spouse . Good communication means giving your partner the benefit of the doubt and being clear and kind in your communications . Remember , you want to make it safe for your spouse to talk to you . If you 're criticizing each other , attacking and defending in your communications , annoyed that your spouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that does not create a safe environment to talk . If your communication has broken down dramatically , you might want to seek professional help so that it does n't  destroy the marriage . <p> 6 . Do n't  ramble . Try to make your message clear and to the point . Its confusing to hear a rambling message and its likely that the recipient of the message may get annoyed and frustrated , which then makes the sender feel unheard and unappreciated . Think about what you want to say before you say it . If your significant other is rambling , let them know in a kind way that you 're getting confused and want to hear the message , but are unable to . Do n't  just blurt out that they are rambling ! <p> 7 . Listening versus hearing . There is a big difference between listening and hearing . When you hear your partner , you hear only the words and often react to those words with anger . That 's where the communication starts to break down . When you really listen to your spouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're putting yourself in their shoes and are less concerned about your own reaction . How do you really listen ? Take turns talking to each other . Rather than a dialogue , have two monologues . Put your feelings aside and for two-to-three minutes let your partner talk . During that time , do n't  interrupt or comment on his/her point of view . Really look and listen to your spouse . Then switch . When you truly listen , without talking , you will hear things in a very different way and your dialogue will create a whole new perspective . <p> Good communication takes practice and is an invaluable tool that has the potential to make all of your relationships healthier , stronger , and more fulfilling . 113804 @qwx733804

" <p> Giving your kids the keys to a car is one of the scariest moments of parenthood . " Will they make safe choices ? " is always a parents haunting concern .

Here are critical tips to boost your teens safety and your sanity . These tips are culled from research as well as talking to teens . <p> 1 . Set Clear Rules Against Drinking and Put the Rules in Writing <p> A study of over 1,000 teens found that teens with " hands on " parents who establish clear behavior expectations , monitor their teens comings and goings , and are n't  afraid to say " no " are four times less likely to engage in risky behaviors like drinking and driving . Teens also say they will be more cautious about drinking and driving if they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be strict without feeling guilty . It makes no difference whether your teen has a drivers license without a carpeers do . So stress one rule : " NEVER ever drink and drive . " <p> Have your teen sign a contract to never drink and drive.SADD ( Students Against Destructive Decisions ) provides a free online contract to download . It may help them pause just the second they need to not get behind that wheel . <p> Set strict consequences . Stress to your teen that drinking and drivingeither as the driver or passengermeans an automatic loss of his or her driver 's license . Then make a pact : if your teen calls for a ride , he or she can keep that license . <p> 2 . Let Your Teen Know You Will Be Monitoring <p> This sounds obvious but do n't  overlook it : teens say if they know you are watching they are less likely to engage in risky behaviors . Of course , they wo n't tell you that to your face , but they do tell researchers . So be there waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great technique . Then give him a quick check of the following signs : <p> A quick hug to smell for liquor <p> Check eyes for redness <p> Check speech patterns : " How was the party ? " <p> Look for a new pattern of gum chewing or mint sucking to reduce alcohol smell <p> Watch the walk <p> 3 . Form an Alliance With Other Parents <p> A survey by The Partnership for a Drug-Free America and called the " MetLife Foundation Attitude Tracking Study " found that the place where teens are most likely to encounter drugs and alcohol is at parties and other social situations . While not shocking , teens say many parties are not adult supervised and in some cases its the adults who are the suppliers . <p> Ninety-nine percent of parents say they would not serve alcohol at their kids party ; but 28% of teens say they have been at supervised parties where alcohol is available . <p> A survey by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia also found that half of teens who attend parties say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parents believe teens attend substance-free parties . <p> Know your teens friends and their parents . Make a pack to monitor each others kids and pledge that there will be no unsupervised parties . <p> Make a rule that you call any parent hosting a party to assure supervision . Doing so helps you find that other parents share rules , which helps when your teen says , " You 're the only parent with those rules ; " you can beg to differ . <p> 4 . Create a Secret Code with Your Teen <p> Teens say that losing face with peers is a big reason they do n't  call for help . " I could n't call you . My friends would hear ! " So create a text code like " 1-1-1 " or a phrase such as " I 'm getting the flu " so your teen can save face and still alert you that he needs a designated driver and rescue . Also make a pack with a trusted adult that if you 're not available , your teen knows he can call that person for help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your teen with no questions asked . Many teens admitted to having a code with their parents , but do n't  use it because their parents did n't  follow through on their " no questions asked " pledge and disciplined them instead . If you want your teen to call , earn their trust . <p> Pass your code on to one trusted adult . Also make a pack with a trusted adult that if you 're not available , your teen knows he can call that person for help . <p> Have emergency backup plans . Give your teen a card with phone numbers of taxicab services and money in a drawer and tell your teen to use in case of an emergency . Doing so does not mean you are giving your approval to drink , but you understand that peer pressure is tough and in case something comes up your teen is prepared and knows how to get a safe ride home if she does n't  call you . <p> 5 . Do n't  Make Liquor Available <p> Teens admit getting alcohol is easyand the easiest place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiest place is in their friends homes . One study at Utrecht University in The Netherlands of 12 to 15 years olds found that the only parenting factor related to adolescent drinking was the amount of alcohol availability in the home . The amount of liquor the parents drank was not a factor . <p> Watch your credit card . The hot place teens buy alcohol is on the internet . <p> Admonish an older sibling to not be the supplier . <p> 6 .

Equally disturbing is the fact that stress now ranks among the top 10 child health problems in America . <p> I 'd be willing to bet that the rise in childhood obesity and stress directly corresponds with three things : <p> 1 . The decline in physical activity , the once obligatory recess and P.E . class , in schools . <p> 2 . The invasion of technology . <p> 3 .

But before we coach our kids , we best coach ourselves . <p> Never forget that we are creatures of habit .

Trying to convince kids to exercise is an exercise in futility . On the other hand , coming up with a physical activity that you and your children can participate in , and enjoy , is very doable . <p> How do I know ? Because we did it .

Understand what makes your wife tick sexually and become a connoisseur at fulfilling her sexual needs . " <p> For those of you women who enjoy a good roll in the hay , the idea of hating sex may seem a bit off the chain . Everything in society today screams at us that sex and women go together like hand in glove . Our hair , legs , lips , walk and even teeth have been described by this veritable term " sexy . " From our earliest adolescent days when we became in tuned to the power of our breasts and butt , many of us grew to revel in our sexuality . It was what defined us as desirable woman . Fast-forward to our marriage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoopla surrounding sex . <p> Admittedly , there are a few women who may have suffered sexual abuse or emotional trauma and who may have tuned out or disconnected from normal sexual desire . There are also those who may be grappling with ISD ( inhibited sexual desire ) for a number of reasons . This discussion is not directed to them . <p> From my own casual conversations and observations , I have noticed that there are situations where wives honestly grow to hate sex . Not only do they hate it , but they grow to develop a deep love affair with their hate . This seeming anomaly simply means that they learn to derive a certain pleasure , power or satisfaction from hating the one thing which they know means the world to their man . While this may seem like just a bit of a mind-game to many , it is a definite signal that a relationship may be in trouble and in need of some serious attention . <p> What causes a woman to hate having sex with her spouse and more importantly why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage doomed to failure ? Can a husband do anything to reverse this ? <p> Why Do You Hate Sex ? <p> Even though women tend to be more in touch with their emotions and are better at verbalizing their feelings not all women are inclined to do so . The stereotype of the shrill nag who just let 's her husband have it verbally is not always an accurate portrayal of how all women choose to handle difficult emotion . <p> Some women , in fact , are pretty good at hiding how they really feel . This is a learned response or a coping mechanism , which can impede a womans desire to connect sexually . Since holding on to anger can produce a false sense of power or of being in control , such women prefer to remain angry with their spouses when some ticklish issue has arisen in the relationship . When were angry , we tend to feel less like victims . <p> For the couple experiencing this problem , their sex-life can be seriously affected . Sex might become as run-of-the-mill as taking out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . She might even decide to withhold sex altogether because this becomes her bargaining chip or trump card . <p> The wife who has been deeply hurt through repeated emotional neglect , who has not had her emotional needs met or the wife who has been cheated on , may also retreat to a place where sex is the least of her concerns . For her , there is a lot wrong in the relationship and sex is no easy remedy . If this situation is made worse by an unreasonable husband who refuses to talk about the issues , or who refuses to seek help , then chances are he will not find a willing , passionate participant in his bed . <p> And of course there are those women who have never , ever actually enjoyed sex . While many seek to enlist their partners active support in getting the most out of their sexual relationship , others may simply acquiesce to the idea that sexual frustration is with them to stay . Expectations , therefore , become significantly lowered because of such a womans failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero sexual effort ; case closed . <p> How is a husband to cope with this seeming uphill battle ? The truth is , it takes two to tango and it also takes two to untangle . A serious lack of sex in a marriage or a dislike for sex by one partner is a serious deal-breaker , which is unlikely to be conquered without some level of cooperation between one another . <p> Is There a Remedy ? <p> While there is no guarantee of a quick fix , the following represents simple home remedies that may at least start the dialogue ; more serious issues may , of course , require the services of a counselor or therapist . <p> Husbands , know your wife . Its every husbands responsibility to become intimately acquainted with the woman he wants to have great sex with ; understanding what makes your woman feel angry , hurt , insecure or loved is at least a first step in the right direction . <p> Husbands , see your wife as much more than a living , breathing vagina that you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wifes whole person by treating her with kindness and consideration in and outside the bedroom . <p> Reverence your wifes body with appropriate comments and touching .

Clearing the air regularly should guard against the storing up of anger and resentment . <p> Sharpen your lovemaking skills . No one wants to make love to a lousy lover for a long time . Understand what makes your wife tick sexually and become a connoisseur at fulfilling her sexual needs . <p> Wives , own your sexuality . See great sex as something you deserve and commit to exposing the issues which hinder you from enjoying it to the max , recognizing that a great sexual encounter is not all about your lover , but also about you . <p> Relax , surrender to the moment and enjoy toe-curling sex .

Why should the calendar dictate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make me feel warm and fuzzy , raising their prices every year for this one night of candle-lit romance . <p> But do n't you see ? That 's the problem . Not the prices , but that this happens just once a year . ( Okay , so the prices can be excessive sometimes . ) I was talking with one of our Hitched experts a few years ago and something in our conversation struck me . I do n't remember the topic of the conversation , but within our discussion it dawned on me that outside of our weddings and anniversaries , most of us do n't seek out to honor our relationships . Heck , a common complaint is that men do n't even remember anniversaries . <p> I actually think it 's good that we have a system in this country that commercializes love and romance .

Spouses and significant others are projected to spend an average of $68.98 . Research has shown married couples that engage in new experiences with each other are likely to be happier over the long term . Of course , this does n't mean that you need to spend money for a new experience , but the holiday is a terrific opportunity to step out of your comfort zone and reconnect . <p> If you still are n't convinced that Valentine 's Day is a good thing , I have a few final questions for you : When was the last time you and your spouse went on a date ?

For Jill , its a matter of trusting her instincts that , yes , its important she gets acknowledged for her hard work and that she deserves a voice in the relationship . <p> So what do you do if this is happening in your relationship ? <p> 1 . Acknowledge that its not petty to feel this way , even though your spouse may lead you to believe otherwise . You have a right to want credit for what you 've done . <p> 2 . Say something to your spouse , without blaming , that gets your point across that this is hurtful to you . For example , " Remember when our neighbor was over the other day and you made it sound like you maintained the garden ? Maybe you do n't  realize it , but that made me feel bad about myself because we both know that I really tend to the garden . I felt unimportant and insignificant , and I 'd like it to be handled differently next time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe your partner will get defensive and make you feel like you 're stupid for feeling that way and that its not a big deal at all . Respond with , " It is a big deal , and we need to find out a better way to handle this the next time . " Or your spouse may be glad that you 're bringing it to their attention . You might even end up having a deep conversation about why this happens , which will bring you closer together because you 'll understand one another better . <p> 4 . Try to get a commitment or promise from your spouse to be aware of this dynamic so it does n't  keep repeating itself . A simple acknowledgement and understanding will make future issues much easier to handle . <p> 5 . Make a plan of how it will be handled the next time . For example , if your spouse " accidentally " takes unwarranted credit in the future , you can ask your partner if you have his permission to interrupt and correct him ( lightheartedly ) should he take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you in advance that means its happening again , so Joe has the opportunity to correct himself before Jill speaks up . <p> If your spouse steals the limelight , take it seriously because it can cause stress , feelings of insignificance , and resentment . Remember that nothing is petty if its the way you feel and it bothers you . Too many couples let the seemingly petty things fester , and soon they are arguing or not talking , and their relationship lacks closeness . By addressing this issue with your partner , you have the opportunity to learn more about your spouse and foster closeness instead of distance . <p> " What 's the big deal ? All I said was . . .

Here are a few things to consider before joining them.BY ANN FRY <p> BigStockPhoto When working together , make sure you 're both going in the same direction . <p> Running a successful business is tough . Maintaining a successful marriage can also be tough . When you combine the two and run a business with your spouse , it can be even more challenging . Throw in a kid or two , add additional outside family members and you 've got a situation that can be total nirvana or a complete mess . <p> Now let 's be honest , there are many issues here we could discuss . There are the wonderful things that work , the things that definitely do n't  work and the things that can be done to make it work if it is n't . <p> First , remember that things that do work and are the reasons for wanting to become co-workers . You love each other , you respect each other , you have complimentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this business being successful . This is a formula for success . Great ! <p> The things that might not work should also be considered . In traditional modern marriages where both people work ( but in different places ) , you see each other in the mornings , evenings and on weekends . Its nice because you get a break and then look forward to being together . In the experience of working together , there might be " too much " togetherness , if you catch my drift . <p> Who holds what position in the business ? Is someone more the " boss " and someone more the employee ? If so , its not easy being managed by your spouse . Resentment can build up , arguments ensue , resistance rears its head . It can be a nightmare . And , oh my gosh , what if you have very different ways of operating . What if one is much more organized and the other is much more loosey-goosey ? Can you see the impact of all of your personality quirks being magnified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider before you put your marriage on the line and launch a new business together : <p> Are You Compatible ? First and foremost , before you go into business together , really , and I mean reeealllly , make sure that you 're compatible to do so . How , you wonder , can you know that ? You might consider taking a personality assessment where each of you can determine your true strengths and areas needing development . A great assessment tool to consider is called The Birkman Method ( www.birkman.com ) . Couples can immediately know what makes their partner tick in the realm of work/career/business and the assessment can run a " Differences to Watch For " report that outlines how to build on each others strengths and make it work . <p> Are You Coachable ? I would suggest you hire a business coach or a relationship coach to help you for the first few months ( if its a new business ) or to come on board wherever you are in the cycle . With a coach , you have an outside mentor who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business . That coach can be objectivesee things from the outside . He/she will be willing to flat out confront the issues that are getting in the way and will pull you up to your individual and partnership best . If you choose to get a coach , ask around for someone that your friends or peers might have worked withget a word-of-mouth referral or research the many coach directories to find a fit . <p> What Do You Value ? How aligned are you on your values ? Before you protest here and say , " Well , I would n't have married him/her if we werent aligned on values , " take a step back . I 'm talking about your business and work ethics and values . What do you want from your business ? Is it the same ? Everyone wants to make money , but what 's beyond that ? Is one of you a driving capitalist that wants to make as much as possible and the other a bleeding heart that wants to create some financial freedom so you can then go out and save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drivers ? ( Your coach can help you figure that out , as can the assessment . ) <p> What 's Your Exit Plan ? Your love and the marriage ( and children ) are the most important things . That 's how it all started . So , what if the business starts to really interfere ? You must have a plan for how to exit the business if its not in the best interest of the relationship . Talk to an attorney and set this upin a civil way and have it in order way before you ever have to see a marriage therapist . <p> I hope this gives you a few things to consider as you consider starting a second relationship as co-workers .

Drive-in movie theaters , hot pants , The Beatles and Tang . Okay , so a lot of us do n't  remember the 1960s , but many of us do know that a lot has changed since then . To further prove the point , the U.S. Census Bureau recently released some figures that show some startling differences , especially when it comes to marriage . <p> For instance , in 1967 , the median age to get married for men was 23 , and for women it was 20 . Fast-forward to 2006men are now waiting until they 're about 27 and women , around 26 . So what 's the deal ? Why wait ? According to Michael McManus , syndicated columnist and president of MarriageSavers.org , its because so many of us are afraid of getting a divorce . " My wife , Harriet , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At that time , everyone assumed their marriages were for life . There were only about 400,000 divorces a year , but by 1979 , there were 1.2 million divorces , affecting a million children . Those children grew up fearful of marriage , for all they had seen was failure . " <p> Chintimini Keith , 28 , would be one of those fearful children . Her parents , she says , had a terrible relationship that ended in divorce when she was young . " I did n't  want this to happen to me , " she says . She and her husband , Darin , 34 , tied the knot last November after they dated for two years and were engaged for a year and a half . In total , the Keiths knew each other for almost five years before getting married .

" <p> Frances thinks that people marry for different reasons now than they did 40 years ago . " I believe people marry now out of choice , " she says . " No longer are people bound by traditional family or religious standards . " <p> Chintimini thinks it could be a combination of things . " Its the idea of having a fun , full life in your 20s , and 30s in some cases , getting established in your career , and then finding your soul mate , " she says . <p> Another interesting stat from the Census Bureau showed that the average American family is shrinking in size .

" For one , we have great methods of birth control . Two , we no longer need big families to work on farms and help actually run the family . And three , we cant afford that many children anymore , " she says . Chintimini thinks todays couples want to experience more before having children , such as traveling and buying bigger homes . " Add to that a couple of college tuition bills , weddings and all of the other expenses that come along with kids and you 'll see why people are having fewer children . " <p> " People think they need new cars , a vacation home and a large home , " McManus says .

@@79604948 @1104948/ <p> 7 Ways to Accept Your Spouse Just As They AreIn order to have a successful marriage you must learn to live together as one even if your spouse does n't  meet your " crazy " expectations.BY SHERRIE CAMPBELL , PH.D . <p> DepositPhoto Stop trying to change your spouse , rather embrace them for who they are . <p> " Stop labeling your way as right and remember it is only right for you . What is right for you may not be right for your partner . " <p> One of the biggest downfalls of marriage is the idea that our partner needs to be different or at least they need to change certain things to make us happier . After all , if they really loved us , they would change anything for us right ? Well , no . Wanting your spouse to change is like asking a cat to bark . The glue to any successful marriage would be to accept your husband or wife as he/she is . <p> Here are seven steps to acceptance : <p> 1 . Watch your expectations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with your thoughts . Is this something that your partner really needs to change for you , or can you change your expectation and meet whatever need is unfulfilled for yourself ? Ask yourself why it is your partners job to always live according to your expectations . <p> 2 . Look for the positive . Negative thinking is much easier than positive thinking because it requires no effort . It is also very self-centered . When we are not accepting our spouse it is the result of seeing the negative in them . Instead of focusing on why someone is the way they are choose to focus on what is great about them . Whatever is not great about them for you , you will need to learn to fulfill within yourself . <p> 3 . Eliminate black and white thinking . Flexibility is the key ingredient to any lasting relationship . It is very easy to view the world in black and white with a right and wrong way to do things , but that 's just not how it is . Things do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are . Stop labeling your way as right and remember it is only right for you . What is right for you may not be right for your partner . <p> 4 . Turn off your inner critic . Our judgments of others are often a result of our personal criticisms . If we stop putting pressure on ourselves to do things the " right " way , we will likely stop putting pressure on others as well . Not judging ourselves is a crucial step to the acceptance of ourselves and our partner . <p> 5 . Stay focused on the present . A lack of acceptance can generate from comparing things to the past . We all make mistakes so try not to ruminate about what happened before and try to live accordingly . Give your spouse the gift of thinking about the now . Comparing things to the past always hinders an acceptance of what is and it destroys marriages . <p> 6 . See things in reverse . Ask yourself how it would feel if your husband or wife were judging you and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your expectations are not being met , keep these questions in mind . <p> 7 . Focus on yourself first . If you are a happy and fulfilled as an individual you will be less critical of your spouse because you will see your needs as needs you are 100 percent capable of meeting . This takes a lot of pressure off of the marriage . Its about personal responsibility for self-love . If you love yourself and are responsible for your happiness you get to love your partner simply for being your partner instead of seeing your spouse as your " need-meeter . " <p> The marriages out there that are happy and that make it are marriages where there are two individually happy and content people coming together . They do not see their union and " completing " them as much as they have a marriage that " adds " to their already fabulous individual life . We are each here to learn to be responsible for our sense of happy .

" <p> As a couple , you want all of the romance , but none of the stress . Wine , cuddling and conversations of the future make for a night to remember . If you want to make your night at home something a little fun , demonstrating a bit of effort without forcing the night , try creating your own wine pairing party .

Get some roses and dim the lights to let your evening begin . <p> Not Everything Goes With Chocolate <p> Grosvenor Market has a great chart of wine pairings . If you scan down , you will notice that chocolate only pairs with one wine ; Cabernet Sauvignon . Lovingly called Cabs , this wine is fully bodied and high in tannins .

Remember only to pour small amounts to be able to appreciate the flavor . <p> Have Some Proteins <p> Chocolates are wonderfully romantic , but an evening diet of alcohol and sugar is a recipe for disaster . Cheeses are some of the safest foods to pair with wine and romance . Since they come in different intensities , it is easy to pair some of the sweeter wines like Prosecco without the food overwhelming the wine . Since this is your dinner and you do not want to be bloated when the romance leads to other activities , cheese is a good source of protein in a dense package . Its enzymes also help settle the stomach and counteract some of the disquieting effects of the wine . A good rule of thumb is to kiss after each of you has had a bite of the same cheese to avoid any mispairings of your own . <p> Learn What You Like <p> One of the prime reasons to do a wine tasting is to begin to discover what you like .

" <p> Its been said that " a good marriage is a long conversation that always seems too short .

Recent research shows that married couples report higher level of happiness , better cancer survival rates , more sex , less loneliness , and longer lifespans than their single counterparts . <p> But , if these aforementioned long conversations are more likely to happen over an indulgent meal than a shared workout , beware .

Over time , you 'll figure out the best exercise format to suit both your needs . <p> 3 . Keep it light .

If you 're the spouse of a military member , thank you for all that your family is doing on behalf of our country . As you encounter people who learn of your family 's situation , try to remember that many people truly appreciate and support the sacrifices that you and your family are making , even if they forget to engage their brains before opening their mouths . 113805 @qwx733805

The Corlisses have known each other for more than a decade , giving love a second go-around on a chance encounter after being out of contact . The couple currently owns a tattoo shop that Mark opened nine years agoup the block from where the Corlisses now liveand they 've recently added a clothing boutique inside where Marlo is able to take advantage of her extensive sales experience . The Corlisses can currently be seen appearing on ABCs " Here Come the Newlyweds . " <p> 1 How did you meet ?

She got my phone number from one of the salesman and called me <p> Marlo : No I did n't  ! I 'll tell her . When he walked into the dealership , it was like 12 years after I had seen him . We had dated for three years before . It was so weird . It was totally fate . That 's what makes the whole thing good . For him to walk in and see me 12 years later , randomly . And then , after our first date , we were together non-stop for three months , then he proposed to me . <p> 2 Why did you both decide to be part of the show ? Marlo : A friend of his told us that they were casting for some sort of newlywed show and that we were a riot and we should try out for the show . We went on the website , and we 'd never seen an episode and we were kind of blindsided . We started to look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is awesome . " Then out of the blue , three months later , they called me at work and asked us to come out to California . <p> 3 What were some of the challenges of being on the show ? Marlo : We were together 24 hours a day , seven days a week . I learned a lot I did n't  know about him . There were a lot of positives and negatives because we were together all the time . But we learned so much from the other couples . It made me realize that some of the bad stuff that goes on in the beginning of a marriage is really normal . Were friends , we pick at each other , we laugh . We did n't  have many challenges , I know him very well . <p> 4 How did the show affect your relationship with each other ? Did you learn anything new about each other on the show ? Marlo : Oh yeah . It was uplifting and it was an experience that I 'll never forget . Just to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different light . Both of us are very hardworking and were very strong headed and passionate people . So the two of us , even in a competitive atmosphereto see us on the same side when we both work so hard in the field , it was crazy .

And it made us reflect on ourselves so it made us learn a lot . <p> Mark : We learned to work together a lot . We were just pulled from our lives , we did n't  have to worry about money or working or the dogs . We had nothing to worry about except each other . So we really learned to work together as a team and just try to communicate better . <p> 5 What kinds of things did you learn from the other couples on the show ?

I went through college with himprobably our biggest growing years .

Its an experience and you see things totally in a different light . And never mind that each personality is different . <p> Mark : I guess every couple is learning about each other just like we were . Seeing each other get a little more comfortable in their own situation . So its fun , you see that you 're not alone . Everybodys just trying to figure it out ; to learn to live with each other , the pros and cons . And I say , have a good time with it . <p> 6 Are you nervous about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its airing ?

Mark : Definitely working together and being married is a challenge , but we have a lot of fun with it . Were a fun couple . We get along great , were best friends . It helps because I 'm an extremely busy tattoo artist , and Marlo helps my life . She helps keep me in line , she helps me make sure everything is done properly . She takes the pressure off of me , so at the end of the day I 'm happier . <p> Marlo : I was uneasy about the whole situation because I was in such a competitive field before .

I am currently unemployed and had to go stay with a friend . I understand that space may help us if we truly work on ourselves , but I am so hurt and feel abandoned . He says he does n't  want a divorce , but things ca n't stay the way they were with routine and negativity . I want to work it out , but I do n't  know how to begin picking up the pieces of my life . I feel more alone now than I did before the separation . He wants me to be positive and hope for the best , but I feel as if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal to feel this way ? This all happened within a weeks ' time from him telling me to find somewhere to stay to actually moving some things . Do I just need more time ? We still talk almost daily , but he does n't seem to miss me at all yet . I 'm so confused . <p> Its very understandable , given the information you 've provided , that you would feel all the emotions you are experiencing : confusion , alone , abandoned and hurt . I would also imagine you are feeling frightened and insecure . <p> One of the most significant theories available for couples today is Dr. Sue Johnsons Emotionally Focused Therapy . Her theory is based on the concept of attachment ; for many , the idea of attachment carries a negative meaning . However , the brain is a social organ . As such , everyone needs to feel a sense of attachment , which starts immediately at birth and continues throughout life . <p> Let me take a moment to make the distinction between a healthy attachment and co-dependence . Whereas the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist without the other , healthy attachment indicates feelings of a marriage where you feel important and sense that your significant other is there and available to you and are not alone . <p> Thus , with this explanation its quite understandable that your spouses suggestion about separating would ignite a sense of abandonment . Not feeling grounded that he is there for you would certainly only increase these alone feelings . <p> On the positive side , the fact that he says he does n't  want to divorce and that you speak everyday seems to indicate hope . Tension , especially if it had been escalating , is never an enjoyable situation for one to live with . I 'm not surprised that as a man , your husband would think that space might help resolve the issue . <p> You do n't  state whether there was active fighting going on . In fact , sometimes its good to have a " timeout . " When emotions are running high , its hard to resolve anything . <p> Personally , as a therapist , I tend to not like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . However , I do know that there are some other professionals who feel it does help . And , in fact , in my own practice , there were two couples that did , in fact , separate . However , in each of these situations , they were headed for divorce rather than using separation to calm things down . And , in each case , the various individuals kept working in therapy and they did get back together again . <p> My suggestion to you would be to find a therapist with whom to work . A trial separation without help will only put distance between you and your spouse . If you can , find a therapist who works with an attachment-type model . Even if the two of you remain separated for a short periodas long as there is a structure in place to continue to see one another and work on your marriage to improve itI know it can be saved ! 113807 @qwx733807

GOLD-BIKIN <p> BigStockPhoto Listening is a skill that you need to pay attention to . <p> It is almost impossible to share a life with someone with whom you ca n't communicate . Most relationships that fail are ones where people talk past each other , rather than to each other . How can one meet the needs of the other if they do n't know what they are ? And , how can you know what they are if you ca n't hear what 's being said because you have n't learned to listen ? Finally , what skills must you develop so that your thoughts , feeling and needs are recognized ? <p> Listening is a skill that must be developed . Try this little exercise some time : Repeat back to someone what you think they 've said to you . It is not easy . People tend to listen with half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond ( or , perhaps , what time the ballgame starts ) . Somehow , what one hears may be what one wants to hear . If this is the pattern of the relationship , there is no communication and , surely , no partnership . Part of a relationship means responding to what 's actually being said , not what you think they mean . Is there anything more frustrating than having your feelings and thoughts being falsely interpreted ? <p> What skills can we develop to ensure that we can actually " hear " what 's being said , that we " understand " our partner 's feelings and that we " see " what he/she is saying ? <p> First , regularly set up times for discussions . Trying to talk to your wife when she 's cooking dinner with a baby on her hip is probably not the best time to discuss a fight with your boss . Expecting your spouse to go over weekend plans in the middle of watching your favorite TV show is designed for failure . For a serious conversation , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no television playing , cell phones off , kids in bed and no other plans to interfere with the discussion .

This way , things do n't become so overwhelming that the entire discussion is focused on you rather than the both of you . <p> Third , make sure that you each have time to talk about your needs , feelings and desires . If you both feel there is time for each of you to speak , you are less likely to be thinking about getting your thoughts into the discussion and more likely to be listening to what is being said . Once one partner has talked about his/her day , the other partner gets the chance to talk .

Listening means listening , not fixing the situation . <p> Part of a relationship is having someone to share with , life aggravation , joy , sadnessthe whole gamut of emotions .

Use these tips to help broaden your views.BY ESTHER BOYKIN , LMFT <p> DepositPhotos Reconnecting with your spouse can happen with just a few simple steps . <p> While communication issues or conflicting styles are usually what couples call my office to talk about , the most common underlying issue is a lack or deteriorating of emotional connection . That sense that we are in a close , safe marriage is crucial to the success of every relationship . Yet that close bond that we all seek is often very elusive . In fact , understanding exactly what we mean when we say things like " feeling connected , " " being close " or " emotionally present " has been difficult for therapists and researchers to define until recently . What couples are seeking , according to Sue Johnson and many other couples therapists , is a secure attachment with one another . <p> This idea of attachment , or adult attachment style , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand the connection that happens with an infant and their primary caregivers . While we have often left these concepts of emotional safety and the importance of physical touch to the arena of child development , more and more research is revealing how these same principals may be at the root of our adult relationships as well . <p> So what does all this talk about attachment mean for you and your spouse ? For starters , it means there is a scientific reason that sometimes your fights dissolve into a desperate plea by one or the other to be heard and that those never-ending battles about " silly " things may in fact be masking a primal need for emotional responsiveness . Adult attachment theory and the schools of couples therapy born out of it could fill many books ; though , there are some basic concepts that you can implement today to start reconnecting with your spouse . Ultimately attachment is about feeling confident in our partners ability to be " there for us " when we need them . In her book , Hold Me Tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplifying the issue into three basic questions : <p> Are you accessible when I try to reach out to you ? <p> Will you be responsive to my needs ? <p> Are you engaged in this relationship ? <p> Her acronym , " A.R.E . " address the most basic foundation of our intimate relationships . Are you always going to be there for me ? Often this question is dismissed by both as needy or dependent , but attachment theory teaches us that our need for a loving connection with another person is not a character flaw or weakness . It is a primal desire like our need for food and shelter and one of the most powerful drives behind our behavior . Think about it for a moment . How many times have you felt an almost desperate need for your spouse to pay attention to you or respond to what may , on the surface , seem like a mundane request ? Have you ever found yourselves going around and around in arguments about an issue that , when emotions have calmed , you both agree are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relinquish your position ? These may have been moments that , what was really at stake , were your sense of secure connection to one another . Unfortunately , couples often overlook the emotional context of their conversations and miss the opportunity to strengthen the love between them . But by answering these questions about yourself and your spouse , you can begin to unravel the deeper meaning behind that fight about the laundry or begin to articulate the vague sense of disconnect that may be creeping into your relationship right now . <p> AccessibleAccessibility is the sense that when you need your spouse ( or they need you ) that you are available to them . For some people it is easier to think about accessibility as a priority . Its not enough to be home at five oclock every night or scheduling a date night once week . While physical access is vital , for many couples it is not enough and often contributes to confusion and conflict . Maybe your wife says you never have time for them anymore . Your response is likely to be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day this week " or , " We went out to the movies just last weekend . " While these answers address the content of her message , they also may spark an argument because they probably missed the emotional context ; she needs you . Being accessible means that it is easy for your spouse to get and keep your attention when they need it . So while coming home early every night is wonderful , it may be the 15 minutes of undivided attention at the end of the night that carries all of the weight . <p> Responsiveness Its important to keep in mind that , while it is easy to remember these characteristics in order , they are not a prescribed step-by-step plan . In fact , one way to hear your partners request for accessibility is by being more responsive . A Responsive spouse is one that works to identify and respond to the emotional message of the conversation . In the above example , if the husband could have responded to his wifes plea that they , " Do n't  spend enough time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a negative cycle of conflict could likely be averted . Sometimes being responsive is easy , such as when your partner is crying and you offer comfort in the form of reassurance and a hug . Other times you are not sure what the emotional message or you may be feeling distant already which can lead either of you to pick a fight or otherwise bait each other into some response . Much like childrens need for attention , our need as adults of safe emotional connection is incredibly powerful which means that sometimes any response , even a negative one , is better than nothing . The next time you find that you or your partner seems to be looking for a reason to fight or purposely pushing the others buttons , stop and ask yourself whether you have been responsive lately . Responsiveness is not mind-reading , you are not expect to miraculously understand every situation , rather it is a willingness to ask questions and demonstrate a desire to be involved with your partner on an emotional level . Without that it is likely that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict as a way to get some level of interaction . <p> Engagement Which leads us to understanding how to be Engaged in our relationships . Engagement is often referred to as being emotionally present or connected . Not always easy to articulate , this is the feeling that nearly everyone is seeking in their marriage . Its the sense of synchronicity between you and your spousemoving emotionally in ways that compliment and support one another . While there will be moments of conflict and disconnect , when you are engaged with each other these moments are easily resolved and working through them can create deeper levels of connection and trust . The most fascinating part of emotional engagement , and truly all three of these processes together , is that the more you each feel supported and connected the less unsure and needy you become .

Many men do n't  know what to do with a womans heightened emotional response and they fear that if they " feed into " her emotions by offering her reassurance or validation , her emotional response will escalate . Men often mistakenly believe that if they jump in and fix the problem , if they point out the ways in which her feelings are illogical or irrational , or if they leave their partner alone , she will feel better .

Here are guilt-free tips to rejuvenate yourself and marriage.BY JO-LLE AMOUROUX-HUTTNER <p> A relationship burns out when there is no more energy to give . A relationship should have energy , hopefully positive energy , but sometimes the energy runs out . When that occurs the simplest path for people is to go into avoidance mode ( leaving the relationship ) in order not to trigger troubling emotions : fear of not being loved , of being rejected , of not being enoughor they will fight those same emotions in a desperate attempt to save the marriage . <p> It is desperate because when actions are driven by fear , the persons main aim is protection and not resolution . You can not protect yourself and love at the same time . Love is about being open and about trust . However , if you continue giving out energy to the marriage without replenishing your own batteries regularly you are going to get into trouble at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six strategies you can implement : <p> Love yourself .

Take time to look at those fears and realize that they have no foundation . Make sure you know your triggers and avoid them . <p> Remember what makes you happy and make sure to make it part of your daily routine . Simple little things like a smile of a child or remembering a fantastic day with your partner . It does not matter what it is , just make sure you experience happiness on a daily basis . By being happy , you will replenish your emotional batteries and you will therefore bring a happier self to the relationship . This in turn will make your husband or wife feel happier too . Remember a relationship is a system . If one wheel of the cog jams , the whole system is likely to come to a stop . <p> Do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs of your relationship and/or your spouse .

While your relationship is essential , it requires you to give energy to it . If you neglect those basic needs , you run the risk of exhausting the energy you have to give . Replenish your personal batteries so that you can feed the marriage . <p> Do n't  push away your family and friends in order to focus solely on your marriage . You have to keep those other relationships in your life alive and grounded . They bring you balance which will provide you with a more positive perspective on your union . <p> Look for the positive . When the " honeymoon " period of a relationship fades away , we tend to forget what we found so appealing in the other to start with . Reality sets in , and we tend to only focus on what we can not stand in our spouse . We have to make a conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , those qualities are still there .

You probably did not focus on the parts of your life that were not going quite right . You probably tried to put your best side forward . Well , it is time to remember how it worked , then reapply whatever it was in those first dates that started your relationship . <p> Remember , if you have depleted your " relationship batteries , " you can not expect to be happy in it . You need to work at recharging those batteries for yourself first so that you can keep the relationship energy flow going for both of you . <p> Joelle Amouroux-Huttner is a life coach specializing in burnout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more assured in their choices .

NOLL , JD , MA <p> Depositphotos Keep your relationship on a level playing field by negotiating your needs . <p> " In relationships , the myth is that if I am nice , loving , kind , and affectionate , my partner will reciprocate . " <p> Relationship negotiation does n't sound very romantic or sexy , but it is the foundation upon which love is based . Without strong , conscious relationship negotiating skills , couples are bound for disappointment and frustration . Here are four principles of relationship negotiation . <p> Principle 1 : Fairness is What You Create , Not What You Deserve <p> We live by a myth that life is supposed to be fair to us . If we follow " the rules , " eat our vegetables , be nice and work hard , we will be rewarded for our goodness . In relationships , the myth is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionate , my partner will reciprocate . There is just enough truth in the myth to make it believable , but it 's mostly bogus . Life is not fair , and you are not entitled to fairness . There , I said it . <p> If you want to be treated fairly , you have to work at it . Fairness is not some gift bestowed by your fairy godmother . On other hand , a good life is not about grabbing everything you can for yourself to the exclusion of everyone else . That 's not fair either , to you or to those around you . There has to be a balance , and that balance is created by you through relationship negotiation . Fairness is what you create , not what you think you are entitled to because you are good person . <p> Principle 2 : You Have to Ask for What You Want <p> As infants and small children , we could not ask for what we needed . We could only make a lot of noise to get someone 's attention . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed a diaper change or a bottle . Miraculously , Mom or Dad appeared and took care of us . <p> While we learned how to negotiate many other aspects of our lives as adults , we were never taught how to ask for what we needed and wanted in relationships . Instead , we carry a belief that our unspoken needs will be recognized by our partner and met magically . Of course , when that does n't happen , we feel rejected , frustrated , unloved and neglected . The principle is that you have to ask for what you want in your relationship . Whatever it is that you want is not going to appear out of the blue . If you do n't make your needs known to your spouse , do n't expect him or her to read your mind . <p> Principle 3 : Do n't Be Afraid of " No " <p> The corollary to having the courage to ask for what you want is having the courage to accept " No " with grace . Just because you ask , does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free choice without guilt-tripping him or her into capitulating to you . If you ask for a hug and your spouse says , " No , " you have a great opportunity to find out why . Maybe the timing is not right . Maybe the place is not right . Maybe your partner is in another mindset at the moment . Your best response is not to get angry or feel rejected , but to negotiate . If not now , how about hug in 15 minutes . <p> " No " is usually never the final answer . The secret is to welcome a " No " as an opportunity to negotiate something better later . Most importantly , " No " is rarely a rejection of you . If you take the time to find out what is going on , you will learn that the " No " is all about your partner , and not about you . <p> Principle 4 : Doormats Are For Dirty Feet <p> Relationships are about power . When couples feel like the power is balanced , the relationship tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other partner feels disempowered , the relationship is in difficulty . Do not allow yourself to be a doormat . If your desire for love , attachment , and bonding is so great that you suppress your own needs , you are in deep trouble .

Often times , both parties are actively involved with their childrencoaching teams , sharing the driving to activities or helping with homework , for example . Sometimes a family is very involved in religious organizations , such as participating in church choirs or teaching Sunday school .

You have an opportunity to share time with each other , which is extremely important in maintaining the relationship . <p> It is said that the average American couple spends about 20 minutes per day of quality time together . Compared with the eight or more hours the parties may spend with colleagues at work , the couple is almost strangers in comparison without one or more common interest .

For others , it conjures of images of juggling divorced families , running around on Christmas Eve to find the exact Ninja Turtle your child wants , and overspending on your credit cardall combined with the impact of overeating and drinking . <p> If you 're leaning towards the latter , the festive season can have a negative impact upon your relationship and you could end up as one of the statistics of people who call a marriage counselor after the holidays . <p> But there is hope . Here are four ways to help survive the holidays with your spouse . <p> 1 . Be careful at holiday parties . Holiday parties can be both wonderful and fraught with danger . People are letting their hair down at the end of a busy year , they 're drinking , celebrating , unwinding with close friends or colleagues . Shocking statistics exist , such as this survey of 2,000 UK adults by high-street lingerie retailer Ann Summers where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual Christmas partyincluding some who were marriednot to mention a few that turned into long lasting affairs . Not the most rigorous of data collection , but the danger is real . <p> Consider carefully any involvement at Christmas parties where spouses are n't  invited . Yes , you need to have trust in a relationship for it to work , but were all human and sometimes its best to avoid temptation . Both of you could make an agreement about what works for you , whether that be limiting alcohol or perhaps only attending parties where you can go together . <p> 2 . Make a financial plan . Disagreements over finance are a common cause for relationship stress , and the holiday season can intensify this . In addition to the pressure of buying gifts , you 're possibly hosting parties or family dinners or shelling out on a vacation . <p> If this is a risky area for you , its important to plan for avoiding this stress altogether . Try to put the expectations of the season into perspective . Having the biggest turkey , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or staying in a plush hotel are not nearly as important as supporting and loving your partner . <p> 3 . Be respectful to your partners family and their traditions . I know your mother-in-law might be a nightmare , and Uncle Jasper tells the same drunken story , but your partners family are important to him or her and letting your distaste arise at Christmas will never end well . Consider limiting your alcohol intake so you do n't  let your real feelings show ! <p> If you have a marriage with mixed cultures , you also might find it difficult to understand or embrace their traditions . Any reaction from you is likely to hurt your partner and could be detrimental to your relationship . For the sake of your spouse , read up on their familys beliefs or simply aim to smile , be supportive , and enjoy this special time together . <p> 4 . Consider Christmas Day without the extended family . You might be surprised to learn that while all of the above are important , the number one cause of arguments prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your parents or the in-laws ? If your parents are divorced and remarried , forget about it . There 's suddenly up to five options for spending the day ! <p> Couples can get so worked up about this , they can cause long lasting damage to their relationship . Often this is because we resort to personal attacks on our spouses family as a reason for not choosing their home for the celebration , and that takes everything to a whole new low . <p> I 've known some couples who have chosen to spend Christmas Day at home . They spend Christmas Eve with one family and Boxing Day with another . It does n't  make either family particularly happy , but its a compromise which sometimes works for couples who want to honor each other above all . <p> My recommendation this holiday season is to remember that once you are married , your partner is your priority . The love you share and the commitment you have made must come above all else for it to survive and prosper .

If you do n't  want to feel controlled , tell them ; if there 's something you do n't  agree with , speak and state your point of view . <p> 3 . Spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding and time intensive . The more serious the conflict , the more time a couple may need to recover . However , the time spent in therapy is just as important as the time spent in between sessions . Just be together and avoid distractions . Find a safe environment and start a conversation . Go for a walk in the park and remember the good times ; and do n't  let anything interfere with your positive emotions . Avoid talks related to your current issues and stay focused on the positive things that brought you together in the first place . <p> 4 . Stop making baseless assumptions . Married life is all about trustthats why it is important to give your spouse the benefit of the doubt . Stop making baseless assumptions and have more trust . Be honest about the things you want to say , and avoid checking his/her every move . Instead of stocking their actions all day long , become more curious about their feelings and emotions . <p> 5 . Value your independence . Many couples do n't  stay married for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . The relationship becomes suffocating , and we werent born to live like this .

Strive to preserve your independence , and keep things interesting . <p> " Instead of stocking their actions all day long , become more curious about their feelings and emotions . " <p> 6 . Avoid talking about a divorce . Even though you believe there 's little hope for your marriage right now , just avoid talking about a divorce . Marriage counseling should be about saving your relationship ; mentioning divorce will instantly make the other worry that you 're not willing to fix anything . Its tough to instill hope in a dying marriage . However , that does n't  mean there 's nothing you can do to save it . Commit to having a conversation about what can be done to make things better , and focus on the positive aspects of your relationship . <p> 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happened in the past is tough . You must learn to deal with the relationship in the present . There 's no use in remembering what your spouse did months ago . Its already done , its in the past , it does n't  matter anymore .

Marriage counselors are experts at helping couples overcome obstacles .

@@79604987 @1104987/ <p> BigStockPhoto It 's okay for your child to raise their hand and ask to have a choice , but know the rules . <p> Choices are the best tool for preventing and stopping power struggles and rebellion with your children . There are a few ways you and your spouse can run into problems when it comes to giving your child choices . Here are a few guidelines for effectively setting limits within the choices you give them . <p> First , do n't  give a choice if there is no choice . " Do you want to take your medicine ? " sounds like the child has a choice . Instead say , " You need to take this medicine . Would you like a chewable or liquid ? " Or , " Do you want to take it before or after eating ? " Or , " What drink to you want to ' chase ' it down ? " <p> Obviously , you do n't  need to offer all of these choices . I 'm giving several example so you can see that even in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is often some way the child can have some choice or control , which prevents power struggles . <p> Rule-of-thumb : If there is no choice and if something needs to happen offer choices for how or when it happens . Here 's are a few more guidelines to follow . <p> 1 . State your bottom line ( the minimum standards that must occur , what is non-negotiable ) . Then you or your spouse can offer choices within those limits . Your limits will usually relate to safety , health , rules , rights and things like that . Those are issues that the both of you can and need to control . <p> 2 . Practice with your spouse and allow your child to offer choices . " We can have meatloaf or fish for dinner , unless you have an idea for something nutritious and delicious . " Remember that the two of you should always state your bottom line , unless there are truly unlimited choices . Do n't  be overly rigid about forcing children to pick one of your choices . Any choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to reach a win/win solution . <p> 3 . Make the choices respectful to both you and your child . If either of you say , " Either quit throwing the ball in the house or I 'll take it away , " you are making a threat and not offering a respectful , fair choice . An effective , mutually respectful choice would be , " You can either play with the ball outside or with another toy inside . You decide . " Here , you and your spouse can address their safety concerns and respect the childs need or desire to play . <p> 2 . If your child is persistent , you can say , " You can decide or I 'll decide for you and you might not like what I decide . " <p> 3 . If children do n't  like the choice they made , acknowledge their disappointment and remind them that they can choose another option next time . <p> 4 . If they tend to change his/her mind , confirm the choice and your expectation that he/she sticks with it . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? Once I pour the milk on the cereal , I expect you to eat it . " <p> One final note about choices : Some couples have so much success using choices within limits that they use it in every situation .

After all , Christmas and New Years have barely ended , and I 'm already pressured into thinking about creating yet another perfect day , which I may not do right ( causing stress ) , which may cause hurt feelings ( causing anxiety ) and which could possibly lead to a fight about our relationship ( causing fear that our day will be ruined by dredging up old , unresolved issues ) ! <p> Our society has sold us a lot of expectations around Valentines Day .

KAREN SHERMAN <p> BigStockPhoto Getting your spouse to see a therapist can be tricky , but can be important for your marriage . <p> First , let me commend you on the fact that you 're looking to get help for your marriagegreat ! Many people are apprehensive to seek the assistance of a professional because they perceive a stigma attached to it ; something along the lines of , " There must really be something wrong with me if I have to go see a therapist . " Sadly , this is an unfortunate commentary on our societal belief system . <p> So how do we get your spouse to join in ? If when you raise the issue , your spouse has a bad reaction , I would first recommend letting the issue go for a little while . Its never a good idea to try to force something on someone when their " back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when things have calmed down and the two of you are in " a good place " with each other , broach the subject again raising it as something that is very important for the two of you . <p> Since everyone is different , there may be any number of reasons that might be given as to why he or she is hesitant to seek help . Let me offer some typical possibilities , as well as the ways you can respond . <p> 1 . Your spouse does n't  think anything is wrong with the relationship that the two of you ca n't work on together . <p> Let your partner know that you believe the two of you really are doing the best you can and want the marriage to work , but that you do n't  feel as connected as you could be . Ask him/her to honestly assess if that feeling exists for them as well . Do not put blame on your spouse , but rather acknowledge that both of you need to learn better ways to respond to each other . <p> 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for marriage therapy only to end up divorced . <p> You might be surprised to learn research has indicated many times that therapists who attempt to offer traditional types of marriage therapy are not successful in keeping a couple together . It has been shown , however , when an educational , skills-based model is used , there is far greater success . Make sure when you speak to a possible therapist before you set up an appointment , you inquire as to whether the person employs an educational skills based technique . <p> 3 . Your spouse raises a concern about not having the finances for marital counseling . <p> Suggest that you are willing to look at where else your budget can be slimmed down since this is such an important item . Note that you can try to find someone who is in your insurance network or ask the therapist if he or she works on a sliding scale . <p> If you are still met with resistance , all is not lost . Sometimes , people feel more comfortable in a setting that is not one-on-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriages . I would suggest you look at the Married Life Events calendar or Smartmarriages.com for comprehensive listings of such offerings . <p> Finally , I am a firm believer that very often you can change your marriage around if only one person makes a change . The reason for this is because if one person does things differently , very often the other person will start to react differently . Its the principle of action is equal to reaction . If you go to my site , **27;1790;TOOLONG , you will find a free program that offers you a tip a day for three weeks that is based on this concept . <p> Some people need to get their feet wet before they can jump in , so to speak . Perhaps , after trying some of the more benign methods , if you still need some assistance from a counselor , your spouse will be more willing to go . <p> I hope these suggestions will get you goingand again , you 've taken a wonderful first step by wanting to make a change ! 113807 @qwx733807 
@@79604990 @1104990/ <p> Many married couples argue about their in-laws . The good news is that you can have a terrific marriage , even if you have difficult in-laws . The best way to overcome any challenge in marriage is to unite as a couple , and the best way to unite as a couple is to reach loving compromises . <p> Let 's say , for example , that you and your spouse are arguing about how often you see your in-laws . Your partner wants to go visit his ( or her ) parents twice a month , but youd prefer to visit them twice a year . Each of you has a choice . You can behave in a way that brings you closer or in a way that pushes you apart . <p> Here are six ways to work toward loving compromises that will bring you closer as a couple . <p> 1 . Communicate your feelings and needs in a tactful , respectful way . This is n't the time to be condescending , accusatory , or controlling . It wont help to nag , give guilt trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past wrongs . Its no time to criticize or gossip about your spouses parents . <p> In the scenario mentioned above , you might apply this advice by saying , " Honey , I feel frustrated when you pressure me to visit your parents twice a month . I need to spend what little free time I have going on date nights , getting together with friends or just having some time to myself . I 'd like for us to try to reach a compromise so I wont feel resentful whenever I visit your folks . " <p> 2 . Try to see things from your spouses perspective . You will be better equipped to reach a loving compromise if you stop to consider your partners feelings and needs . You wo n't help the situation by being self-centered and judgmental . <p> Your mate may truly want to visit his folks twice a month , or he may just be doing it out of obligation . If he s just doing it out of obligation , encourage him to be more honest with his parents so he can have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in a miserable game of tug-o-war by trying to please you and his parents . Be compassionate of his feelings and help him become a loyal husband rather than resenting him for being a parent-pleaser . <p> 3 . Think outside the box . Realize there are probably several more options available than it seems at first glance . <p> Just because your husband wants to visit his folks twice a month does n't  mean you have to go with him every time . He could visit them without you sometimes . Or his folks could come to your house instead . You could meet them at a halfway point . You could divide your visit between in-laws and friends nearby . You could stay at a hotel . <p> 4 . Barter with each other . You are n't  the only one with needs , so do n't  insist on getting your way regardless of your spouses needs . Look for a win-win situation and try not to be stubborn or inflexible . <p> Maybe you could agree to cheerfully visit your in-laws twice this month if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been wanting to try next month . Or perhaps you could visit your wifes folks next weekend if she helps you paint the living room this weekend . You could try this approach : " Honey , if you 're willing to forego a visit with your folks this weekend , I 'm willing to watch the kids so you can golf with your buddies . " <p> 5 . Meet in the middle . There are n't  any rules about in-laws written in stone , so that means neither you or your spouse are right or wrong on any given issue . It just means that each of you have different opinions , feelings , and needs ; and part of the marriage commitment is caring about each others opinions , feelings , and needs . <p> If your husband wants to see his parents twice a month and you want to see them twice a year , settle on something in between such as once every month or two . <p> 6 . Seize the opportunity to show your spouse that you love him . Sometimes its more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . ( That does n't  mean you should constantly overlook your own needs to the point that you lose yourself . ) <p> If your husband really wants to visit his folks this weekend but youd rather stay home to clean the refrigerator , why not go along with your husbands wishes this time ? It will probably mean a lot to him that you care enough about his happiness to make his needs a priority . Hopefully hell remember your kindness and be willing to reciprocate in the future . Just because you and your spouse argue does n't  mean your marriage is in trouble . In fact , disagreements can actually strengthen your marriage if you make it a habit to reach loving compromises that bring you closer as a couple . <p> Jenna D.

" <p> Even in the best of marriages , there could be a time when you feel like your spouse is shutting you out . For instance , Jane and John had good communication and were never short for conversation . However , as of late , Jane has noticed that John seems distant , non-conversive , and often retreats to the family room to watch TV alone . Additionally , John seems to have enough time for extra golf outings , but not enough time for Jane . <p> Because of his change in behavior , Jane asked John if there was something wrong . Initially , he told her , " Nothings wrong I 'm just tired . " Jane let it go for the short-term , but as time went on , his behavior did n't  change and she became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their marriage . In desperation , Jane reached out to her friends for advice and support . Oddly enough , some of her friends were experiencing the same issues Jane was experiencing , but the reasons were disturbing to her . It turned out that a few of her friends were dealing with infidelity . Jane , now panicked , quickly goes into action . <p> She approaches John and asks him directly if he s having an affair . John was shocked by Janes question , and he immediately assures her that there is no one else and that he loves her . She believes him , but she still does n't  understand his distance and silence . He does n't  realize he s being distant , so he s not sure what to do to reassure her that everything is okay . <p> Even though John is not having an affair , and they still love each other , this is nevertheless a warning sign that something has shifted in the marriage that needs to be addressed sooner rather than later . Jane is wise to suggest therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in agreement . <p> In therapy , it was discovered that John was extremely overwhelmed with his schedule , the kids , their friends , and commitments . He did n't  realize that he was distant to Jane due to the demands that filled his plate . With this realization , they were able to talk again and strategize a solution . Now they 're making sure that they put their marriage first , above all . <p> So , if your husband or wife is shutting down , take it seriously . View it as a warning sign that something has changed which needs to be addressed ASAP . Then , here 's what you should do : <p> 1 . Address the change in behavior . The first line of defense in any situation is to try to talk about the problem . Hopefully your communication skills are good so that there 's more likelihood to get to the bottom of why your partner might be shutting down . For Jane and John , though their problem was not resolved even with good communication , it did allow them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do next , since John was n't able to identify the reason he was shutting down . <p> 2 . Be proactive . Because the communication of John and Jane was n't getting to the root of the problem , they were smart to be proactive and get help before something more drastic happened in their marriage . Because John was the one who was shutting down , it would seem that he would have eventually cheated on Jane . But he was happy in the marriage and just overwhelmed without even realizing it . Jane , however , was feeling neglected , and her needs werent getting met so she wouldve been more prone to cheat on John . <p> 3 . Make the necessary changes . In therapy , John was able to understand why he was shutting down . One of the main reasons he started checking out was because of tending to the needs of their friends , who were also experiencing their own marital problems . Without knowing it , and along with the overloaded schedule at home and work , it simply put him over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cocooning in solitude . What John and Jane learned in therapy was to lessen the burdens of life by being cautious of overload , better time management , and putting their marriage first . <p> When changes are ignored they tend to build momentum , and something as normal as being overwhelmed with too much to do can turn into something more serious , such as fighting , infidelity , or marital breakdown . The lesson ? Follow Janes lead . She sensed something was wrong and took action to resolve the problem . 113804 @qwx733804

@@79604993 @1104993/ <p> Unless someone is completely vicious , no one enters a marriage with the intention of destroying it , yet the divorce rate remains high and couples , even if they do n't  divorce , are often unhappy and in loveless marriages . By being aware of what you may be doing in your marriage that could eventually destroy it , you can create a successful and flourishing relationship . Here are seven signs to look out for : <p> 1 . Complacency . Just because you fell in love does n't  mean you 're going to live happily ever after . Marriage takes effort . Stay interested in your spouse by talking about your lives , your work and your relationships . But be thoughtful by not bombarding your partner with mindless chatter or endless complaints lest you eventually tune your spouse out . Get therapeutic help for chronic issues . <p> 2 . Taking each other for granted . Do n't  assume that your marriage is infallible . Youve heard the stories of couples breaking up when you thought they had the perfect marriage . This can happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are to you . Show and speak appreciation daily . Little gestures take no time and go a long way . Begin and end the day with an appreciation . <p> 3 . Not paying attention . Is your spouse all of a sudden moody , angry , distant , sad , or uninterested ? Or overly happy or concerned about their appearance ? Or has there been a death , a new job , or any major life change , even if its positive ? Pay attention to these signs or events . They could signal trouble , such as an affair , an illness ( physical or mental ) , a job loss , or income changes . No sign is too small to address . If you 're paying attention , and sense something is not right , address your concerns . <p> 4 . Not enough time together . Of course , we all have busy lives and individual interests , but you did get married for the companionship and partnership . Do n't  forget that and make sure you schedule time alone with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leave the kids at home , leave your work behind and just focus on your partner . If not , you 'll just become strangers . <p> 5 . Lack of communication . If you 're not connecting verbally , physically , or emotionally , your lack of communication will cause marital problems . Nothing is ever solved by not talking or distancing yourself from your spouse . Make it a priority to make time to get current with each other . Open communication creates healthy relationships . <p> 6 . Sweeping issues under the rug .

@@79604994 @1104994/ <p> Communicating : Why it 's More Successful With Strangers Than With Your SpouseA new study shows that communication with strangers is more likely to hold water than with the ones closest to us . Here 's why.BY DEBBIE MANDEL <p> DepositPhotos When you 're talking with your spouse , too many of us assume they know what we mean without explanation . <p> If you sometimes feel that you are married to a stranger , you may be right ! In a new study , " The Closeness-Communications Bias : Increased Egocentrism among Friends versus Strangers , " couples who live together tend to overestimate their ability to communicate . When polled these couples made claims like : " We think alike , " " I can read his mind " or " We understand each other . " <p> You tend to draw on intimate knowledge of a spouse or even a friend to make sweeping assertions based on an illusion of understanding him or her . However , many conflicts happen when someone close to you fails as a mind reader . If research has anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courthow clear and specific is your speaking style , and have you omitted a necessary detail or two especially when the concept is ambiguous ? <p> People tend to believe that they communicate better with a spouse or a close friend than with total strangers . Boaz Keysar , co-author of the study and a psychology professor at the University of Chicago calls it a " closeness-communication bias . " The study indicated that in one experiment , participants who followed direction of a friend were more likely to make egocentric errorslook at and reach for an object only they could seethan were those who followed direction of a stranger . In two additional experiments , participants who attempted to convey particular meanings with ambiguous phrases overestimated their success more when communicating with a friend or spouse than with strangers . Keysar and his colleagues argue that people engage in active monitoring of strangers divergent perspectives because they know they must , but that they " let down their guard " and rely more on their own perspective when they communicate with a friend . In short , you assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain ( or listen ) more precisely when communicating with a stranger . <p> Here is how this might play out in your marriage or close relationships . You are busy , stressed or immersed in your own thoughts . You do n't  focus on the other person and you certainly do n't  consider how your words will be received by your good friend or beloved . For example : <p> * " You never take out the garbage , " might be literally interpreted and therefore countered with , " This is not true . I took out the garbage two months ago when you had that stomach virus . " <p> * " You should n't have bought me this gift . " Next time he wont and you will be angry . <p> * " I feel so hot in here . " He thinks you want sex and , what you really want is a new , more powerful air-conditioner . <p> The next time you interrupt your spouse with something like , " I know what you are going to say . I have heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most people tend to take those in their inner circle for granted , skipping a necessary step or two in clear , concrete communication .

" <p> Dear Mr. Dad : The assistant principal at my daughters school called me in for a meeting today and told me that my 12-year-old is bullying several children in the school . I am in shock . This is n't behavior Ive ever seen in my child and I 'm frankly having a hard time believing it . What should I do ? <p> As tempting as it may be to dismiss this as some sort of mistake or overreaction on the part of the school principal , you need to take these complaints seriously . Bullying is rarely reported until a situation has become upsetting enough for others to feel threatened , frightened , or to even have to stay away from school on account of a bullys behavior . <p> Start by establishing a cooperative rapport with the school . Let the administration know you are willing to work with them to find a solution and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters unacceptable behavior . Try to learn as many specifics as you can about the bullying incidents . Most schools keep ( or should keep ) written records of complaints they receive , which will help you to be focused and specific when you speak with your child . It will also be helpful in the event that she is being unjustly accused . Ask for advice about how to introduce the subject with your child , and let the school know you expect to be notified immediately of future complaints . <p> Next , set up a time to speak with your daughter . Make sure you 're feeling calm and that you 've got plenty of time to talk . Children accused of bullying often feel insecure or threatened themselves , and their behavior can be an attempt to increase their own sense of power and control over their own lives . So approaching your daughter in an accusatory , angry , or disappointed manner will only make her feel worse about herself . <p> Chances are shell claim that she either did n't  know she was causing other children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . If she denies the reports , investigate as thoroughly as you canshe may be right . The following questions about her school day , friends , and activities may help : <p> 1 . Who are your friends ? Why do you like them ? <p> 2 . Have you recently made new friends and dropped old friends ? <p> 3 . What do you do at recess ? Who do you play with ? <p> 4 . What games do you play ? Who decides who can join in ? <p> 5 . Who do you sit with at lunch ? <p> 6 . Are you afraid of anyone at school ? <p> 7 . Are you upset about anything going on at home ? ( such as divorce , bereavement , relocation ) ? <p> 8 . Do you feel that you are bullied ? <p> In many cases , though , kids who bully do n't  interpret their actions the same way other do . Its important to let her know that her actions are hurtful and unacceptable , not funny or harmless . Explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them want to stay away from school . If the bullying involves physical abuse , such as kicking , pinching , punching , or shoving , ask your daughter how she would feel subjected to the same treatment . Ask her to put herself in the place of the children she targets and to describe how she would feel . <p> Children tend to bully those they see as easy or vulnerable targets , usually because they are in some way different from their peers . Kids who are overweight , wear glasses , hearing aids or braces , belong to a different race or culture , have a physical or learning disability , or live in a less ( or more ) affluent part of town , can become the target of a bullys taunting and teasing . Sometimes the bully is jealous of someones talent , ability , appearance , or even wardrobe . Talk to your daughter about how she feels about differences and about the respect that all people are due , regardless of their differences . <p> Finally , think about the example you 're setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traitshe may be taking that a step further and being aggressive instead without realizing the difference . If your own style is confrontational , your child may be mirroring the conflict resolution tactics she sees at home , which wont necessarily serve her well elsewhere . Most children are basically good and decent , and truly regret causing harm to anyone else . By teaching them a more conciliatory style of relating to others , they will be empathetic to the distress their actions may cause .

" <p> Most of us have experienced some level of resentment at one point or another in our lives . Many of us may feel resentment often , maybe even constantly . Resentment can spiral out of control , fester in our lives and begin to take over our thoughts , actions and even our wellbeing . Resentment can overwhelm our innate sense of joy and ease . <p> How do we overcome these feelings and regain contentment and peace of mind ? Here are 10 steps to help control the downward spiral of resentment . <p> 1 . Understand what resentment is . Resentment can show up as bitterness over the perception of being treated unfairly .

Do you have a sense of righteousness about your feelings ? Recognize the trigger for your feelings . <p> 4 . Understand that only you can control your feelings . The feelings associated with resentment set off a negative chain of reactions in your mind and body that can damage your relationships at home , at work and even your health . Once you understand that you are experiencing resentment and why , you can begin to take ownership of your feelings rather than project them on to another person or situation . Taking ownership puts you back in control . <p> 5 . Prepare to be rid of resentment . In the emotion of resentment , you are having a conversation with yourself .

Ask yourself , " Is this who I am ? " " Is this my innermost value ? " No . It is not . Now identify your deepest value . Is it happiness ? Peace ? Compassion ? <p> 7 .

@@79604997 @1104997/ <p> Once , you could n't make a chowder in New England without purists frowning over your shoulder . I learned this as a young chef working aboard a ship cruising the waters of Nantucket , catering to the tastes of paying guests . We could give them moules mariniFres scented with wine ; we could make garlicky coquilles Saint Jacques , a French dish that was in fashion then , from the lovely little bay scallops that we gathered in the early mornings off the boat ; but we could n't , on any account , meddle with their chowder . <p> Orders to abide by tradition were passed down from the captain , an overbearing man steeped in the lore of the locals . His notion of the dish was informed , he said , by a chapter in " Moby-Dick , " a copy of which lived on the bookshelf next to all the nautical charts . You might recall the chowder of Melville 's day , shared between Ishmael and Queequeg at the Try Pots Inn on the very same Nantucket Island where I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was made of small juicy clams , scarcely bigger than hazel nuts , mixed with pounded ship biscuit , and salted pork cut up into little flakes ; the whole enriched with butter , and plentiful seasoned with pepper and salt . " <p> Only recently have I revisited that time-honored tradition and given any thought to the Nantucket captain and his chowder obsession . By all historical accounts , his beloved stew owes more to the bivalve-loving Wampanoag than to the fish-phobic Pilgrims . The truth is that chowders are as varied as other soups ; they always have been and always will be , reflecting regional customs , ingredients at hand , current trends or , simply , inspiration . <p> Key Ingredients <p> Some Yankee versions are still broth-based , such as the one Melville immortalized , but otherswhether at the hands of the French or the colonistscame to be fortified with milk or cream . A Zester colleague , scholar Clifford Wright , cites the recipe of one Lydia Maria Child recorded in the mid-19th century cookbook " The Frugal Housewife " as the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version makes the use of milk official , along with quahogs such as cherrystones , potatoes , onion and butter . Ideally , Wright says , you should use raw , fresh creamery milk , but if that 's not an option , " mix whole milk with cream for a substitute . " <p> The Evolution of New England Chowder <p> Native American cooking is no doubt the true source of our New England chowders . According to historian and author Linda Coombs of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head ( Aquinnah ) on Martha 's Vineyard , the mother of all New World quahog chowders was corn-based . Her ancestorsthose gentle people who lived on the islands of southern New England , farming and whaling well before the first English appearedrelied on maize as well as beans and winter squashes year-round . " Fresh or dried , they were the basis for soups or stews or any dish , " she explained when I spoke with her on the subject recently .

What might we call such a dish butchowder ? <p> Beyond the Clam <p> While the natives prized clams for both their meat and their shells , the early colonists ' chowders contained no clams at all but rather assorted fish . " Clams became accepted to them in time , but it is on record that in the 1620s , the Pilgrims fed clams and mussels to their hogs with the explanation that they were ' the meanest of God 's blessings , ' " writes Waverly Root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A History . " <p> Although I was bound to the Nantucket captain 's version while cooking on the boat , once I got my own kitchen , I quickly shed the Puritanical approach .

They 're out there setting goals , connecting , taking risksnot just professionally but personally too . <p> In other words , how we work and how we play are deeply connected . When we approach life with enthusiasm and intensitywhether were driving a collaborative project or learning how to surfwe grow , learn , gain new skills , and expand our sphere of influence . And when we see that taking risks pays off , were willing to take more . <p> That 's why I have a summer homework assignment : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your world . Not only will you increase your joy in the moment , you 'll get practiced at boldness and adventure . With time this attitude will become your default setting , increasing the likelihood of success in all areas of your life . <p> The good news is , you do n't  have to travel to Timbuktu . There are adventures waiting in your own backyard that you have probably never considered . <p> Here are seven tips to help you wring every drop of joy and excitement out of this summer : <p> 1 . Do n't  waste the weekend . How many times have you realized that its Sunday evening and you have n't accomplished any of the things you meant to over the weekend ( other than sleeping in and binge-watching a show on Netflix ) ? This summer , I encourage you to make the most of your weekends by rising early(ish) and spending your time purposefully . <p> Set a goal for every weekend to do something youve never done before , whether its visiting a new state park , learning a new sport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new type of cuisine for dinner . Accept the fact that these types of activities almost never happen on the flyyou need to talk to your family and decide in advance how you want to spend each weekend . <p> 2 . Get out of your vacation rut . Is your family going to a certain beach this summer because , well , that 's what you always do ? Even if your family thoroughly enjoys a familiar destination , consider making plans to visit a new place this summer . For example , instead of experiencing the surf and sand , you might rent a mountain cabin or plan a road trip through several national parks . <p> Vacationing in a new place will be a treat for your brain , your eyes , your taste buds , and more . You 'll probably meet interesting new people as well . Its fine to use some of your vacation time to rest and rejuvenate , but be sure to plan a few adventures too . Maybe this will be the year you finally take that surfing lesson or tour the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a new place will be a treat for your brain , your eyes , your taste buds , and more . " <p> 3 . Find creative new day-trip destinations . Imagine a 100-mile radius around your home . Chances are , there are more fun places and events in that radius than you can cram into one summer : hiking trails , historic sites , lakes , new restaurants , museums , community theaters , festivals , and more . Whether your family is taking an out-of-town vacation or not , plan to visit some of them . ( What better way to make the most of your weekends ? ) <p> Some friends of mine block out one weekend every month for a day trip . They keep a folder full of clippings and ideas , and they are slowly working their way through it . Remember , adventure is n't something that can be found only hundreds of miles away . You may be surprised by what your area has to offer , and by how much it has grown and changed while you 've been stuck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill . One of the great things about summer is that the pace of daily life does tend to slow down somewhat . Take advantage of longer days and more relaxed schedules by taking the time to learn something new . Sign up for a class , join a club , or ask a friend to share her expertise . <p> Your new skill could be kayaking , target shooting , water skiing , mountain biking , yoga , woodworking , or even skydiving . If you 're not at least a little nervous about what you 've chosen to do , move on to something else . Remember , the idea is to challenge and exhilarate yourselfand that wont happen if you 're not stretching beyond the boundaries of what feels comfortable . <p> " Some friends of mine block out one weekend every month for a day trip . They keep a folder full of clippings and ideas , and they are slowly working their way through it . " <p> 5 . Do at least one thing to give back to your community . Men and women who care enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure are the kinds of people you want to meet . On a personal level , giving back enhances gratitude and contentment , and can even reduce stress levels . So whether your " cause " is homeless animals , adult literacy , or clean oceans , get involved this summer . <p> I want to be clear that giving back does n't  have to mean writing a big check . Your time and talents are just as impactful . If you cant find a preexisting organization in your community that speaks to your heart , pull together a group of likeminded folks and start your own project , like a community vegetable garden . <p> 6 . Make a point to meet new people . Your kids will meet new friends during summer sports and day campand you should try to do the same ! If you 're putting my previous tips into practice , you 'll already have dozens of new people in your orbit . You might also attend networking events , get on a new team at work , introduce yourself to familiar faces at the gym , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Women , I would especially encourage you to seek out other women . Women inherently know how to make satisfying , mutually fulfilling connections . In fact , I am seeing the growth of a true women-helping-women movement in which we are creating an ever-expanding network that offers expertise and support to women in business , government , education , philanthropy , and other fields . <p> Most of us are so busy and overwhelmed that we just do n't  make it a priority to connect with other women . But when you 're purposeful about doing this , your life will become richer , more exciting , and more creative . When we join hands , we can accomplish so much . <p> 7 . Do all of these things in the spirit of joy and gratitude . There 's one important caveat when it comes to stretching your boundaries and planning an exciting , adventurous summer : You have to approach this goal with a positive , open attitude . Otherwise , your plans wont feel any different from the other uninspiring items on your to-do list , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach your potential . <p> That said , when you 're in the midst of the daily grind , summoning up positivity can be easier said than done . The good news is a significant amount of our happiness comes from the ways we perceive our worldand we can choose to have an attitude of gratitude . Instead of thinking of what you have to do , focus on what you get to do . Every time you learn something new , receive a new opportunity , or learn a new skill this summer , allow yourself to savor the moment and say thanks . You 'll find that your joy levels steadily riseand that you are more and more excited to expand your world . <p> " The good news is a significant amount of our happiness comes from the ways we perceive our worldand we can choose to have an attitude of gratitude . " <p> As an adult you may not get a summer vacation , but its time to recapture the excitement and anticipation you felt as a child at the beginning of each summer season . Start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above and notice the changes in your mood , creativity , motivation , and maybe even energy levels . here 's to the most exciting summer you 've had in yearsand to expanding your potential ! <p> Nancy D.

" <p> Should you , or should you not allow your high school senior daughter to go on an unsupervised spring break trip with her friends ? I unequivocally vote no , and here are my reasons whyand you can blame me if your daughter throws a fit . <p> Adolescents are not developmentally ready to handle the temptations and situations that occur at spring break gatherings . The prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) of the teenage brain , the executive center , is not fully developed in females until 18-19 years of age , and for males its early to mid 20s . Its harder for them to think before they act and to control their impulses , making them ripe for irresponsible decisions that can carry long-term consequences .

This makes them more vulnerable to dangerous situations than previous generations . <p> " Why do n't  you trust me ? " is a common refrain teenagers throw back as a result of hearing " no " to their request . But your denial is n't so much about not trusting them ; its more about not trusting situations they are likely to encounter at spring break sites that my mom used to refer to as " Sin City .

" <p> Distracted driving is at an all-time high and we are seeing more and more accidents from cell phone use among all age groups . For teen drivers though , inexperience and accessibility to smartphones has made for a lethal combination . The Governors Highway Safety Association reported in February that the number of 16- and 17-year-old driver deaths increased 11 percent for the first six months of 2011 . If the trend continued for the second half of 2011 , it would have ended eight straight years of cumulative declines in teen-driving deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages from celebrities and public-service announcements , teens still do n't  seem to be getting it . Two nationwide studies this month show that teen drivers classify distracted driving differently than older drivers. ?

When asked , as passengers , how they would feel about different situations , about 90 percent reported that they considered a driver who was sending or reading text messages or e-mails as very unsafe .

Only about one-third of younger passengers 18 to 24 years old would say something to a driver who was talking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or older would speak up . <p> " Distracted driving is an epidemic on Americas roadways , and our youngest drivers are among the most at risk , " said U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood in a statement . <p> Texting Drops With Age <p> Findings from the NHTSA survey show that drivers 18 to 20 years old report the highest level of phone involvement in crash or near-crash incidents .

In addition , drivers younger than 25 are two to three times more likely to drive while sending or reading a text message or e-mail. ? Bridgestone found that of those younger drivers surveyed , one-third admit to reading text messages while driving , and one-quarter do not believe talking on the phone while driving is dangerous . <p> " The message is getting through to some extent , but there is still much work to be done , " said Angela Patterson , manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and graduation right around the corner , the American Automobile Association ( AAA ) , Nationwide Insurance and Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) have the following tips for parents to help teens get home safely during prom season . <p> * If teens are driving , make sure they are n't distractedtell them no texting , talking on the cell phone while driving or talking with passengers in the back seat , AAA recommends . <p> * Nationwide recommends not allowing too many prom-goers into one vehicle , since more passengers mean more distractions . <p> * Set a reasonable curfew for the evening and let your teen know you will wait up for him or her to return home , AAA says . <p> * MADD encourages parents to talk often with their kids about alcohol , but especially before events such as prom , spring break and graduation when they may be faced with decisions about whether or not to drink . <p> * AAA tells parents to talk with teens about a safe ride home , prom rules and the consequences for breaking the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity for driving at all .

@@79605005 @1105005/ <p> Many of my clients in my San Francisco private practice and couples in our Marriage Prep 101 workshops shared these sleep foundation findings with us . They were relieved to learn that other couples also say that they are too tired for sex . However , many of them also asked me for tips to help ! Here are 10 tips for couples whom are too tired to have sex . <p> 1 . Remember that you are not alone . Fatigue is indeed a leading reason for couples to have less sex . However , do you really want to become one of the " No Sex/Low Sex " couples ? According to research , 20 percent of all couples have sex less than 10 times per year . When couples get out of the habit and ritual of being sexual with each other , they lose an important opportunity for connection , closeness , intimacy , pleasure and fun . <p> 2 . Look at your health and wellness . Make the commitment to yourself and your spouse that you will find a way to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sex life . Rule out medical issues around low thyroid or iron deficiency . Look at your diet . Are you at a healthy weight ? Do you eat enough protein ? Do you get enough exercise ? Are you getting a minimum of seven hours of sleep per night ? Taking care of your own wellness and health can make a significant difference in your energy level and interest in sex . <p> 3 . Manage time at home better . You will need your spouse 's help with this . If you have children , get them to bed earlier . While one spouse cleans up after dinner let the more tired one take a bath , relax or read a magazine . Take time to release stress so sex does not become one more chore at the end of the day . Pick a time that you both will be finished working ( including work details , laundry and e-mails ) so you do n't just fall into bed . Turn off the TV or computer at an agreed upon time . If your career or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , it 's no wonder you are too exhausted for sex . If you have sex only at the end of the night , you may end up choosing sleep over sex on a regular basis . <p> 4 . Follow the 10 minute rule . If you are not in the mood or feel too tired for sex , give it 10 minutes . According to research , half of the population feels amorous or horny and wants to initiate sex . The other half is not at all interested in sex until after they start kissing and fooling around . Give it a try . Like physical exercise , if we start with 10 minutes , we often stick around and get more into it . Next time you feel too tired , try kissing and fooling around for 10 minutes and see if you get more aroused or interested . <p> 5 . Create windows of opportunity . Do you ever have a sex date ? Rather than go to dinner and a movie , stay home and have a sexually playful evening ? Create windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a long day . Do you ever make love when little children are napping ? Or send them to a friend 's house and stay home and make love in the morning or afternoon ? What about wake-me-up-sex where you welcome your spouse waking you up while you are asleep to fool around ? What about making love before you go out on a date ? Set your alarm early and make love at the beginning of the day ? Couples come up with so many excuses . You have to be creative to find and create good times for sex . <p> 6 . Take a marriage vacation . No kids . Fun , romantic and sexy focus to even a weekend can jumpstart your sex life . The more sex you have the more testosterone , dopamine and oxytocin you release . Let your physiology do its magic by having lots of sex while on vacation . <p> 7 . Redefine sex . Does sex always have to mean sexual intercourse ? Women , maybe you are exhausted , but could get more into sex if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massage ( just receive ) , long passionate kissing or just one person receive oral sex ? Do you ever think of giving sex as a gift to your spouse ? Too many couples decline sex because they are tired and they do n't have the energy for a luxurious , lengthy experience . What about just giving your guy a hand job or blow job ? What about just focusing on the woman 's pleasure ? I hear that many women wish sex could sometimes be only about their personal pleasure , but they do not tell their guys . Have you ever heard of " eat her like a peach " or " pretend you have a tic tac in your mouth ? " Why do we have a widely accepted term for oral sex for a man : " blow job , " but not one for a woman ? If either of you think that you are too tired for sex , ask each other if you are up for anything sexual ? Maybe a sexual appetizer could be on the menu even if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 . Communicate . Talk to your spouse about your fatigue and then challenge each other to take better care of yourselves and find better times when you are not so tired . A common mistake that many couples make is losing momentumthey get a babysitter , go out for the evening , drink some wine , feel amorous , and then come home . One person takes 15 minutes checking e-mail and the momentum is gone . The other person tried to wait for them , but fell asleep in the process . Been there , done that . Keep the date feeling going all the way to the bedroom . Or living room . Or hot tub . <p> 9 . Spice it up . Are you really too tired or honestly has sex become a little boring or too predictable ? Have a heart-to-heart sex talk . What do you each like about your sex life ? Focus on the positives . What would you like to be different ? Spice it up . Try something new . Visit a sex store together . Read a sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired if sex was more fun , novel and engaging . <p> 10 . Rally . If you have dinner plans and are exhausted , do you usually rally for the occasion ? When you feel tired and have to go to work , do you drink a little coffee , show up and do your best ? Do you give needed love and attention to your children ? Sadly , many couples begin to see their sex lives as optional . They take it for granted and allow fatigue to be an acceptable reason to continuously decline making love . <p> Commit to making your sexual relationship an important way to connect with each other , be playful , and have more fun ! Research by sex therapist Dr. Barry McCarthy found , " When couples are happy enough with their sex life , it only accounts for 15 percent of how happy they are in their relationship . However , when either person is unhappy with their sex life it can account for 85 percent of their relationship happiness . " Yes , we are all busy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Talk to your spouse . Do not allow the mantra , " I am too exhausted for sex " to continue any longer . Get creative , motivated and inspired to prioritize your sexual relationship .

" <p> When you first started dating your spouse-to-be , you most likely focused on things like similar interests , a sense of humor , shared values and other signs of compatibility . Unfortunately , what many people do n't  take into consideration is financial compatibility , and how their partners financial habits may differ from their own .

Since money is one of the largest sources of conflict in a relationship , its important to have money discussions regularly throughout your marriage , starting now . <p> Here are some tips to making sure you 're both on the same page , financially . <p> 1 .

Something you would never spend money on is perhaps something your spouse constantly buys , or maybe you both put different values on financial goals . Understand that your spouse may not see money the same way as you do , and do n't  push your views or feelings towards money on your spouse . Instead , find ways that you both can compromise on key differences , and find a happy medium that will leave you both satisfied . <p> 3 . Set specific financial goals . Its hard to save when you do n't  really know what you 're saving for . Set specific goals , such as saving for a house , taking a big vacation , or going somewhere special for your anniversary . Working towards a common goal together can help you align financially , especially when it comes to spending and trying to decide where to cut back . <p> 4 . Initiate " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for couples to stay on the same page and track progress . Set aside time at least once a month to check bank accounts , credit cards , and credit scores , along with goal progress .

Not understanding how finances work can greatly hurt your chances of financial success , so make sure you are both educated on the basics of finance . Couples should work together to become better at credit and finances , and learning together can help you bond while also reducing financial stress . <p> Sandra A.

Set your goal and develop an approach to making modest changes that add up to achieving your goal . Here are a few examples that may help explain this approach : <p> Goal : Build a Healthier Plate <p> Approach : Eating a healthy meal includes vegetables , fruits , proteins , whole grains and calciumrich dairy ( or non-dairy foods ) . For a week , take note of the how many food groups are represented on your plate at each meal . Over the next 2-3 weeks , slowly begin to add the missing group(s) , while reducing the over-represented foods on your plate . <p> Here is a simple tip : When you sit down for a meal , draw two imaginary lines through the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Fill one of the four sections with grains or starchy foods such as rice , pasta , potatoes , bread , or corn . <p> * Fill the remaining two sections ( half of the plate ) with vegetables and fruits like broccoli , carrots , cauliflower , cucumbers , tomatoes , bananas , oranges and apples . <p> * Then , add a small glass of non-fat milk ( or calcium-fortified non-dairy milk , such as soy ) . <p> Goal : Eliminate Soda and Sugary Drinks <p> Approach : Count the number of sodas you have in a day . Set a goal that , say , in five days , you will reduce that number by half . Keep track of your progress . Over the next five days , cut the number in half again , and in a few weeks , you will be down to nearly none .

Identify the meals that you eat the fastest and ones where you can find a little more time to eat . Start out by adding two to three minutes at each of these meals .

Put your fork or food down between bites and drink a glass of water with your meal . Before you know it , you will be enjoying a nice slow meal and good conversation with your family . <p> This is just the tip of the iceberg . There are so many goals we can set for ourselves , but if they become lofty , we tend to stop striving to reach them .

TRINA READ <p> Gabriel Lefrancois Should you turn down the volume on your sex noises ? <p> Have you ever noticed that there is no " Miss Manners " etiquette regarding the appropriate level of sex noise ? What is the suitable conduct for both the listener and the maker of noise while there are sexual relations going on ? <p> Situation #1 A couple months back I was staying overnight at a hotel . About 1:00 a.m . I woke up to a honeymooning couple having zealous sex in the next room . It then happened again at 1:45 , and then again at 3:10 . As thrilled as I am about people overtly enjoying their sexuality , I do not believe it should infringe on my sleep time . <p> Then again , that was at a hotel where the rules garnering hot and loud sex are fuzzy . It is expected for couples to let loose at a hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepers . Outside of a hotel , what does the average person feel about making sex noises with other people in close proximity ? My observations show two camps : the first camp is too terrified to have sex because they might make the slightest noise and everyone would know .

I was awoken by my guests ' loud sex noises . The happily married thirty-plus-year couple went about their business for about an hour . All the while , I closed my eyes real tight and tried to go back to sleep . It did not work . In fact , it took a few more hours for me to drift back to sleep . <p> The next morning as I dragged my butt into the kitchen to make some blessed coffee , the couple in question came bouncing up the stairs . They were laughing , slapping and teasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and thoroughly tired demeanor would tip them off to my sleepless night . Nope . They were still in their sex induced love haze . <p> Having slept through the entire performance , my husband could not understand why I was miffed . He said , " You 're the sex expert , should n't you of all people be open to folks having loud sex ? " <p> " Yes , " I repeat for a second time in this column , " I am totally in favor of people having loud sex , just not when I am trying to sleep . " I then came up with an analogy , " It is the same as them going into our living room in the middle of the night and turning our TV on full blast , waking up the entire house .

I would rather stick my hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conclusion that there is no tactful way to ask rambunctious couples to keep it down while having sex .

Use these tips to make your next drive enjoyable.BY DIANE GOTTSMAN <p> DepositPhotos Follow these simple road trip tips to keep the mood inside the car much cooler than the temperature outside . <p> " When your spouse alerts you to nature 's call , pull over at the next opportunity . Do n't try to see how long she can hold out . " <p> Summertime is road trip time . There 's something magically liberating about hitting the open highway for a summer getawayespecially when it 's with someone you love . Following these 12 etiquette tips will help ensure you are still speaking to one another when you reach your destination : <p> 1 . Offer to take turns driving . Even if one of you normally does all the driving when you travel by car close to home , do n't assume that person wants to drive all 12 hours of the trip . Offer to give them a break and ask again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Refrain from offering critiques of the driver 's performance . Backseat driving and slamming on imaginary brakes from the passenger seat are sure ways to create tension and unpleasantness in the vehicle .

On a long road trip , it 's fair to defer to the primary driver on temperature controls . They need to stay comfortable and alert . That said , if your spouse likes the cab so cold that your lips turn blue on the average drive to the store , be ready on a longer trip by bringing supplies to help you manage your own temperature : blankets , sweaters , wool hats , whatever it takes .

When your spouse alerts you to nature 's call , pull over at the next opportunity . Do n't try to see how long she can hold out . <p> 8 . Fuel up with snacks and meals . Nothing keeps the mood light on road trips like good snacks . Be sure to pack an ample supply .

A brief list of some essentials : your phone , computer , e-reader , camera and chargers for all of them ; blankets and pillows ; a flashlight ; an emergency kit with flares ; toilet paper , tissues and paper towels ; hand sanitizer ; a spare key ; sun block ; plenty of drinks and snacks ; and the number for the roadside assistance service you signed up for ( you did sign up for roadside assistance , right ? ) <p> 11 .

@@79605017 @1105017/ <p> 10 Steps to Deeper Intimate RelationshipsBuilding intimate relationships can be done by following these simple tips.BY STEVEN DESALVO <p> Alejandra Quiroz Getting close with someone requires letting them in and sharing vulnerability . <p> " Intimacy is a single-tasking event , not a multitasking coincidence . " <p> Intimacy develops in all of our relationships when we are able to be honest with ourselves , honest with others , and express our vulnerability . Intimacy is often considered as a sentiment shared only by couples or in romantic relationships , but all of our relationships have varying levels of intimacy associated with them dependent on the level of honesty and vulnerability we are willing to exchange . Intimacy is the fiber that connects us to people . When we feel disconnected from ourselves and from others , it is usually intimacy and our intimate connections that need our attention and focus to bring us back into the very desirable state of intimate connection with others . <p> The following are 10 ways to deepen intimacy in all of your relationships : <p> 1 . Your presence matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we show them we value our relationship and our time together . Being present requires that we keep focused on our interaction rather than letting our thoughts wonder from the conversation . Intimacy is a single-tasking event , not a multitasking coincidence . <p> 2 . Limit distractions . When you are engaged , avoid the typical distractions of cell phone calls , texts , and alerts by turning off mobile devices so you can engage with your undivided attention and full presence . Interruptions and distractions in our interactions break the flow of connection and intimacy that we have the potential to experience . It is our undivided attention which brings the feelings of deeper intimacy to our relationships , and relays our ability to prioritize what is more important : our relationships . <p> 3 . Share your truth . Bring as much truth and honesty to your interactions as your relationships will allow . When we share truth , we move closer into intimate connection with others . Every relationship has an associated context or level of truth , but gradually building shared truth over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 4 . Deeper understanding starts with listening . Allowing a person to speak uninterrupted allows for the back and forth sharing of ideas . Listening , without projecting how you might respond or what you think they might feel or experience , allows you to come closer to deeper understanding of what is being said , and strengthens the connection between you . <p> 5 . Be your authentic self . Trying to please other people when it goes against who we are , or what we believe , eventually comes back to hurt us in relationships . When we speak and behave from our authentic self , people know who we are and what we are about , and then can choose how to interact with us accordingly . It is better to be disliked for who you truly are , than liked for who you are not . <p> " It is better to be disliked for who you truly are , than liked for who you are not . " <p> 6 . Words match behaviors . Betrayal of intimacy often occurs when we say one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you love or like someone to their face , and then speaking negatively of them to others behind their back betrays intimacy . Keeping our words aligned with our behaviors builds deeper trust and intimacy . <p> 7 . Communicate feelings . What you feel , communicates more about you to other people and builds deeper intimacy versus communicating your thoughts alone . When we communicate our feelings , as well as our thoughts about those feelings in our interactions , they feel it , and we feel it , and together we develop deeper , more intimate connections . <p> 8 . Resolve conflicts . Conflicts can build deeper intimacy in our relationships , if both sides in a conflict are willing to resolve these amicably to serve the needs of the relationship .

Regular words or acts of gratitude show how we value and cherish our relationships . <p> It takes time to develop intimacy in relationships and you can not force it . When we show up as our authentic self through honesty and vulnerability , we create the space to initiate new intimate relationships and allow those we have to expand . What most of us feel on a regular basis is the human desire to connect with and be accepted by other humans . The connection and acceptance we desire can be reestablished through the development of deeper intimacy in all of our relationships .

" <p> When it comes to the discussion of sex , we all know that married sex has been given a bad rap . When we think of marriage and sex , very often words like boring , predictable and infrequent readily come to mind .

For those couples going through the bedroom doldrums , taking a fresh look is a great way to strengthen your marriage . It also provides a baseline from which you can challenge yourself as a couple , to explore and experience new sexual frontiers ; At the same time , reveling in the positive aspects of your relationship allows you to see how such adds a unique dimension to your sex lives , which is second to none . <p> The following represents some of the key reasons why married sex should be celebrated to the max . <p> 1 .

Unlike others who may have to synchronize schedules from a distance , most married couples have literally only a few feet to travel to get connected . Knowing that your spouse is just an arm 's length away should not be forgotten or taken for granted ; instead let your lack of distance solidify and increase the times you do connect sexually . <p> 2 . Zero embarrassment : While we should never lose the desire to look special for our spouse , the familiarity of marriage should count for something . Being familiar with each other 's nakedness and physical flaws , and loving each other in spite of them , removes the pressure of trying to be physically perfect . This lack of body consciousness should free us of any lingering inhibitions and open us up to being more adventurous and experimental in the sack . <p> 3 .

Body knowledge : Of course learning our spouse 's body takes time and should never be viewed as an exercise which is ever completed . As we age and as our sexual needs change , undoubtedly , there will be new things to learn . Nonetheless , knowing what pleases our spouse certainly removes the pressure of reinventing the wheel with each and every sexual encounter .

Knowing that our lover is also the person we vowed to be with for " better or worst " should be a powerful reminder of each other 's personal value . Our spouse is n't some stranger from off the street or someone we hooked up with in the club , but an individual with whom we made a meaningful promise .

For example , one person may prefer floral while the other wants leather seating in a living room .

A classic example is to combine couch pillows with colors that compliment the sofa , but are n't  the same design or texture . Mixing various accessories can also bring a multifaceted look to a room . For example , if you have pictures of your family , wedding or vacation , you can mix wood frames with silver accents or crystal lamps . Additionally , Sheridan recommends thinking about the placement of essential furnishings such as a TV and what to use on the windows , whether its shades , fabric or side panels .

Every couple and every marriage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much the same . <p> In learning to understand what might be going on in your own marriage , its important to start with the basics .

In understanding that certain behaviors affect sexual connection over time , it can be easier to understandand changethe habits and tendencies that work against us . So , sit back , put on your science hat , and read on . <p> Animals On Drugs <p> Let 's face it ; were animals . Nature has its way of ensuring survival of the species ; when we become attracted to someone , this attraction leads to the desire to bond and mate . When you met your partner , its likely that sparks flew and passions were flamed in the early months of your relationship . In the beginning stages of a romantic relationship , infatuation and a desire for bonding often lead to intense desire and sexual activity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire for pleasure and connection heighten . In basic terms , the guy wants to conquer and sow his seed ; the gal wants to bond and procreate . These base , atavistic needs serve us well enough at the early stages of a relationship , but we need much more to sustain sexual intimacy in the long run . <p> Looking at this concept from a neurobiological perspective , partners initially become bonded by rising levels of the neurotransmitters phenethylamine ( PEA ) , dopamine , and oxytocin . Of course , other hormones and neurotransmitters are at work , but well focus on these three key players . <p> Let 's start with the neurotransmitter PEA . Higher quantities of PEA are produced during the infatuation stage of a relationship . PEA acts as a stimulant ; it elevates energy , mood , and attention . As interest and passion grow , we feel the wonderful , positive effects of the increased levels of PEA . On the downside , its important to note that feelings of sadness and depression often occur when PEA levels drop . <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " reward and pleasure " neurotransmitter ; this vital chemical is involved in our emotional responses . Dopamine functions on many levels to keep us well and happy . From supporting motivation and bonding to generating feelings of well-being and satisfaction , adequate levels of dopamine are vital to our health . As we fall in love and have positive interactions , dopamine levels naturally increase . When we are sexually aroused by touch and close contact , dopamine levels rise even higher . When sexual activity results leading to orgasm , extra doses of dopamine flood the brain . On a physiological level , dopaminea powerful neurotransmitter that is involved in all addictionsgets us " hooked " on sex and love . Unfortunately , dopamine levels fall after orgasm ( more rapidly in males than females ) , and feelings of well-being and satisfaction dissipate . As dopamine levels subside , we crave and seek the same interaction ( sex ) that made us feel so good . Of course , the rapid fluctuations in dopamine levels also correspond to the emotional " highs and lows " experienced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roller coaster ride that is often experienced in the earlier stages of relationships . <p> " Although oxytocin levels tend to fall after orgasm , oxytocin levels can be better sustained by maintaining close physical contact after orgasm . " <p> Thank goodness for the famous " cuddle hormone , " oxytocin . Oxytocin , which acts as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter , leads to strong pair-bonding . High oxytocin levels allow us to connect and form strong bonds during the initial stages of a relationship . Known as the " cuddle hormone " for good reason , oxytocin counteracts the emotional ups and downs that result from the fluctuating dopamine levels . Oxytocin makes us feel safe and bonded ; it also counteracts fear and anxiety . Oxytocin helps produce a sense of connection and emotional stability . Although oxytocin levels tend to fall after orgasm , oxytocin levels can be better sustained by maintaining close physical contact after orgasm . So , cuddling and holding after sexual intimacy not only feels good , it also works on a positive physiological level . <p> When we experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we automatically desire more sex to overcome the dips . Like any " addiction , " the neurochemicals that flood the brain during sex leave us craving more . Its only natural , then , that this cycle continues ; sex gives us a sense of feeling emotionally high and physically good , so we want more sex . However , we cant forget that the emotional lows are also part of the sex cycle . These lows , in fact , can be a contributing factor to the decline in sexual activity . Being animals , we crave situations that leave us feeling good , yet we also want to avoid situations that leave us feeling low or edgy . As such , when we begin to connect sexual intimacy with the lows of the cycle , sexual interest naturally wanes . " Oh , no ! " says the brain . " Avoid this . Its does n't  feel so good after all . The sex is n't worth the aloneness I feel afterward . " When the roller coaster cycle of terrific sex and emotional fluctuations continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sexual connection , most couples can not sustain the constant emotional instability ; something has to give . <p> " We cant forget that the emotional lows are also part of the sex cycle . " <p> Breaking the Chains of Physiology <p> This leaves us with looking for long-term solutions that do n't  leave partners at the mercy of their physiology . For those committed to having a thriving relationship , there is work to be done in finding and maintaining healthy ways to connect sexually without relying on the highs of the roller coaster ride . It takes thought , time , and energy to keep passion alive after the infatuation stages ; unfortunately , many couples take seemingly easier routes . <p> Some partners simply give up on the relationship . Another partner is sought , and the same wild and passionate roller coaster ride begins anew within a different relationship . In other cases , partners choose to seek passion elsewhere ; infidelity may provide a quick fix , but the relationship suffers . Some relationships rely on constant fights and resulting " make-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunately , this patternand the severe " lows " that resultcan deeply impair connection and damage true intimacy .

In essence , most couples desire the same connection , romance , and passion they experienced in the infatuation stage of the relationship . This is understandable ; we all want to feel loved , cared for , and connected . The real work comes from learning how to sustain sexual intimacy without relying solely on the primitive , " I want pleasure " part of the brain .

BY SHARON RIVKIN , M.A. M.F.T. <p> BigStockPhoto It 's okay to disagree and even argue about politics , as long as you follow some simple rules . <p> In these tough times of economic and political turmoil , with a critical presidential election right around the corner , everyone is talking politicsaround the dinner table , over coffee , over drinks and at parties . The upcoming election is in the air ! <p> But what about couples who are in different political parties with opposing points of view ? Can they live happily ever after ? <p> It depends on several issues : <p> 1 . Maturity . The more mature a person is , the more able they are to " get out of themselves " and really listen to and respect their partners political position without viewing it as a personal attack against them . Also important is the ability to keep an open mind without compromising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being able to agree to disagree will improve the likelihood of a successful relationship with differing political beliefs . A good example is Maria Shriver and Arnold Schwarzenegger , who seem to have a high tolerance for each other 's differences . <p> 2 . Unresolved Issues . Are there any unresolved issues in the relationship that could be escalating the political differences ? For example , a woman feels like her husband does n't take her seriously because she 's had less education than he has . She frequently feels put down and minimized by him . Lacking her own self-confidence and given her sensitivity to his opinion of her , once they start disagreeing about politics , her feelings of insecurity and being put down escalate . At some point , the discussion about being a democrat or a republican with differing views turns into a hostile disagreement , because she feels it 's one more time that he is n't taking her seriously . Before they know it , every argument they 've had prior to this will be present in the political argument . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger points , the less likely political disagreements will turn into hurtful shouting matches . <p> 3 . Behavior , Values and Beliefs . How much does politics influence the behavior of each person ? If the person 's values and beliefs are so different and rigid from their partners , it will be more difficult to have a healthy relationship . However , the political differences can be an opportunity to turn a potentially divisive , hostile and destructive conversation into one of hearing , dialoguing , seeing another perspective and learning about each other . <p> 4 . Kindness . How does each partner treat the other when politics are not involved ? Can each person in the relationship be compassionate , let go of political issues , and drop down to intimacy without residual effects of the political argument ? For example , can you disagree wholeheartedly , but then go out to dinner and talk about something besides politics without holding grudges or making snide remarks about the previous political disagreement ? <p> 5 .

The higher the feelings of honesty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has at accepting and tolerating different political views . <p> If you really love someone but do n't see eye-to-eye politically , it can be an opportunity to deepen the relationship and actually create more intimacy .

Each person has to get out of themselves a little and be willing to see the bigger picture of their marriagenot just politics . Having opposing political views is also an opportunity to see that , although you may differ about politics , you are n't  too far apart in morals and values to have a healthy relationship . <p> Lastly , the following tips are important to remember if you have different political views and want to stay happily married : <p> * Keep the lines of communication open 90 percent of the time . * Be willing to see the bigger picture of the relationship , not just politics . * Look at resolving relationship issues that could be escalating the political differences . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on accepting our differences ?

" <p> Buying from a private party can score you a deal on a used caroften discounts of 15 to 20 percent when buying from a private seller over a dealership . However , how do you make sure the deal is n't too good to be true ? Dealer insider , Ed Armbruster , gives his tips on buying from a private seller . <p> Q. What should you ask the buyer before purchasing ? <p> A. This depends on the age/mileage of the car . If the car is relatively new , with low mileage , you want to know if it has been in an accident , if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to see any and all oil-change receipts . If the car is a few years old or more , you would want to know if the owner who is offering it is the original owner , and if not , what they know about the original owner . At any point , documentation helps paint a picture of how the car was cared for . Someone who collects paperwork meticulously may very well maintain their car the same way . Finally , ask why they are selling the car : If they stumble around or give you a screwy answer , look closely before buying ! <p> Q. What are some things to look for when seeing the car for the first time ? <p> A. I try to look for evidence of repairs , lack of maintenance , and needed repairs . Mechanically , I look for worn tires , bent wheels , dirty fluids , and oil leaks . ( Is the car parked on the lawn ? If so , why ? Is it so that I cant see the oil spot ? ) In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint , swirl marks , uneven body gaps and missing clips on the fascias and in the wheel wells . The same things apply to buying from a private party . <p> Q. Do you recommend bringing your own inspector ? <p> A. Yes ! Or ask the seller if you can take the vehicle to a dealer or someone you trust for a complete inspection . If the seller is indignant , there may be a reason . The more eyes on a car , the better chance to spot a problem . <p> Q. What kind of documentation is necessary ? Do you recommend completing a bill of sale ? <p> A. I try to always produce a bill of sale that states the vehicle identification number , make , model , mileage , selling price and any agreements that have been discussed between the buyer and myself . I have bought many cars without the bill of sale though . Overall , I would recommend a purchase agreement , typed and to the point , signed by both parties , with a copy to each person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. I always bring the total amount that I am willing to pay for the car . In one pocket I keep my first offer in cash . In other words , if the seller is asking $7,000 , I bring $5,800 in my left pocket , and maybe another $500 in the other pocket . Flashing cash while making an offer can help immensely ! Whenever making a large cash transaction , I always bring at least one other person with me ( preferably someone big ) . Also , always be prepared to walk away . Then , call back the next day , and the next day . You never know when you 'll catch someone in a desperate state of mind . Remember that there are other cars out there , even though this one sounds perfect . <p> Q. How can you be protected from scams ? <p> A. Well , there are a few different scams that I know of . Cars that have been previously damaged being sold as good cars , cars that have had the miles turned back , cars that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ask for a deposit before you see the car . All of these are avoidable with proper inspections and common sense . Common sense should tell you do n't  pay someone for a car you have n't seen ! ( I 've seen it happen . ) Rule of thumb : If it seems too good to be true , it probably is . <p> Q. How do you know the car 's value ? Do you recommend using a service like Kelley Blue Book ? <p> A. Kbb.com and nada.com are n't  really that accurate . Personally , I look through Craigslist.org and the local paper to see what the car that I am looking at is generally selling for in my area . I always take about 20 percent off of the asking price to project a true selling price . <p> One final tip : Call a random car dealer and give them a description of the car you are looking to purchase and ask for a trade-in value on that car . Whatever the number , remember , that is what your potential seller could get for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually really low , but people get lazy and trade cars in all the time .

" <p> Spending your first Thanksgiving holiday with your new in-laws ? Toss your expectations out the window and get ready to blend in with your in-laws and their " merry " ways . Here are a few etiquette tips to help you put your best foot forward when you are the guest of your new spouse 's family during the holidays . <p> 1 . Show up with a gift .

Find out in advance what you can bring to the gathering . If your offer to bring a dish is turned down , bring a bottle of wine ( not chilled so there will be no pressure to serve it ) or a basket of fresh muffins that can be enjoyed the next day . Offer to chop vegetables , set the table or pass out hors d'oeuvres . If your mother-in-law declines your help , let her know you are available if she changes her mind . <p> 3 .

Do not act upset if your husband 's family has different traditions that you are accustomed . You may be used to eating an early dinner while your husband 's family does n't eat until 8:00 p.m .

Respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a giant group sing-a-long after the last piece of pie is eaten , join in . You do n't really have the option of sitting it out . Roll with it and think of the traditions you 'll start together with your new spouse . <p> 7 . Focus on being a good guest . Even if you 've been around for a while , do n't get too comfortable . Falling asleep on the couch after the meal could send the message that you are either very relaxed or extremely bored . Show up with the mindset of being fully engaged in what 's happening around you and appreciative of your new family members . 113805 @qwx733805

Break the ice if you notice something wrong . <p> " Let him know you 're genuinely worried about him and want to do whatever you can to help . Be sure to reaffirm that its okay for him to need help . " <p> A lot of attention is paid to mens fitness and their physical health , but consider this : 6 million men are diagnosed with depression each year in America , and they account for 79% of suicides in the United States . These are shocking statistics ; and they reveal the devastating consequences societys views of masculinity have on men and their mental health . <p> Boys grow up to be men with the understanding and expectation that they need to be tough , independent , and above all else , masculine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men should just " man up " when they feel anxious , depressed , sad , stressed , and so on , is very damaging . In fact , when you start to look at the statistics , it is sobering to reflect on the price men pay for a " stiff upper lip . " <p> During my depression , I completely lost hope that I could ever recoverand I struggled to ask for the help I needed . I was terrible at showing and sharing my emotions , and much of my inability to do so came from the fear that I would be looked at as weak if I did n't  just grin and bear the mental health problems I was having . <p> Many men fail to take care of themselvesand that 's not just when it comes to their mental health . In fact , in an American Academy of Family Physicians survey conducted by Harris Interactive , 58% of men said they were reluctant to see a doctor . <p> Why is this so ? One of the most credited theories is that men have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaining of feeling i 'll or visiting the doctor is a threat to their masculinity or a waste of time . Even more , men find it especially difficult to ask for help when it comes to taking care of their mental health . <p> So , what 's the solution ? A strong support system ! <p> Nearly 80% of men say their spouse/significant other influences their decision to go to the doctor . Since writing my book and speaking about how people can build their resilience and mental health , one of the most common questions I get asked is , " How can I get my husband or son to seek help when they deny they need it ? " My loved ones , especially my parents , played a key role in my recovery , so I know how important a strong support system can be in someones recovery from depression . <p> Here , are seven tips on how you can encourage the men in your life to seek mental health care : <p> 1 . Break the ice . Be careful about how you approach this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the conversation , making it feel like a natural transition . <p> In my own depression , I experienced black thoughts , pitiful energy levels , and a complete loss of confidence . My mind couldnt grasp information , and I feared my intelligence was lost forever . If you suspect your loved one is suffering from depression , he s very likely suffering similar symptoms that will make it difficult for him to articulate the way he feels . Breaking the ice and starting this important conversation is a great way to lend him the helping hand that could pull him out of his darkness . <p> Ease into the conversation . Discuss the weather , sports , family , etc. in a private placewalking outside is ideal . Make an observation about a change in behavior you have observed . For example , you could say , " I 'm concerned about you waking up at 4 a.m. and not being able to get back to sleep . " Let him know you 're genuinely worried about him and want to do whatever you can to help . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . <p> 2 . Listen without judgment . Its hard enough for men to talk about their problems and emotions without feeling the weight of judgment . <p> Seek to understand the full issueand be specific . You might ask , " What are the things that are causing you to lose sleep ? " " Why does that worry you so much ? " " What do you think can be done about it ? " " Have you considered asking someone else for help/advice ? " If he is struggling to come up with answers , then this might be the time to suggest strategies or someone else he could talk to . If he is able to provide answers , be careful how you respond . Never try to minimize what he s feeling . <p> 3 . Be sensitive . Accept that for many men it is very hard to talk about emotions and feelings of doubt and inadequacy . It is best to talk about behavior rather than threaten his self-esteem . <p> I remember my wife being totally perplexed and wondering why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making an attempt on my life . She had no idea how low I felt because I kept it from her . I did n't  ask for help out of shame , fear , and feelings of hopelessness . <p> 4 . Try multiple choice . Most people like choices , and when it comes to labeling an emotion , its no different . Men may be more likely to discuss their thoughts and feelings if they do n't  have to describe it . <p> People who are depressed yearn for a sustained improvement in mood . Every time I visited my psychiatrist , he inevitably asked me to rate my mood from 0 to 10 , which actually led me to create my own moodometer . I found giving these ratings to be a very valuable resource for tracking my moods and progress . If a man has difficulty discussing feelings , he may respond better to giving this type of rating or even multiple choice . For example , " Are you feeling worried , sad , or angry right now ? " <p> 5 . Give hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach such a delicate situation . <p> You can make the male ego work in your favor here by reminding him of past successes . You could say , " Remember how well you handled X ? We could n't have gotten through that without you . " Or , " You are such an important part of our family . Without you , we would n't be the same . " You might also share stories of people whove also struggled with depression . When I was chronically depressed , I yearned for stories of people who had been through something similar and had come out on the other side . I longed for a glimpse of optimism that could come only from fellow travelerspeople who had been where I was . <p> 6 . Encourage action ( but do n't  overdo it ) . Many depressed people are so hopeless that they feel there is n't a single thing out there that can help them feel better . Their depression has so skewed their outlook that they simply think there is nowhere to turn . <p> In my research talking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest regret is not seeking expert help or diagnosis earlier . This is where loved ones can play a vital role . Offer to make an appointment for them ( and accompany them if they are willing ) . If they strongly resist going to the doctor , you could suggest they do an anonymous online depression test . For further guidance , you can visit www.ruokday.com , the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline ( **33;2367;TOOLONG ) , the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance ( www.dbsalliance.org ) , Families for Depression Awareness ( www.familyaware.org ) , and many other online resources . Remember that nothing will happen until someone makes a move . <p> 7 . Follow up . Check in a few days later to see if he has scheduled an appointment . If he has n't  , mention the idea again and gently remind him how important it is to take care of himself . If he has gone to the doctor for a check-up , encourage him to go ahead and schedule his next appointment so you can have it on the calendar . In the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incredibly important way to assist and influence those who are suffering is to build knowledge of what they 're going through .

" <p> It 's interesting that pets are often granted a level of unconditional love that many spouses can only dream of receiving . What would happen if you made a conscious effort to treat your spouse as well as you treat your family pet ? Try these simple tips and see what happens . <p> 1 . Show some enthusiasm . After a long day at the office , greet your spouse with the same enthusiasm you exhibit when you see your pet for the first time since breakfast . Use the same smile , give him a big hug ( even before you hug the dog ) and act happy to see him walk through the door . <p> 2 . Kiss him on the lips .

The laundry does n't  get done by itself , nor does the grocery shopping or going to the dry cleaners to pick up your shirts . Acknowledge your spouses efforts in handling everyday chores . <p> 4 .

You could earn valuable brownie points by bringing home her favorite dessert or surprising her with tickets to her favorite theatre performance , or giving her a long foot massage ( without falling asleep ! ) while you watch your favorite reality TV show . <p> 5 . Go for long walks . Pets need exercise and your marriage needs special attention , as well . No need for a leash once you 've both chosen the same direction . <p> 6 .

Do n't fly off the handle when things go wrong . When your pet accidentally breaks your favorite dish you say , " Aw , she did n't  mean it . " But when your husband does the same thing you fly off the handle like it was a vicious attack on your grandmothers fine china . Its easy to get into the habit of finding fault rather than showing mercy . <p> 8 . Offer him unconditional love . Just like your dog overlooks your bad hair days and your mood swings , try overlooking your spouses extra five pounds or his habit of humming when he gets nervous . Your dog has doggie eczema and bad breath , yet you love him just the same ! <p> 9 . Check for fleas . Find out what 's itching your mate by being a good listener .

Imagine how your spouse would react if you showed admiration through a playful , " Wow , you look hot " whistle or a genuine compliment . This is not the type of " snap and whistle " that accompanies a request for more popcorn . <p> 11 . Discourage barking . Just like a dog drives the neighbors crazy when barking at a squirrel in a tree , you will incite the same response when you nag about things that are insignificant . Choose your battles and lighten up on the issues that really do n't  matter ! <p> 12 . Rub him behind his ears .

If an older child bursts in , do not lie or get defensive about what is going on . Instead , get dressed and talk about what just happened , acknowledging this as awkward for both of you .

The old style of networking involved a lot of selling your skills and showcasing your knowledge . Resist the urge . Instead , when you 're talking to someone new , ask her about herself and really listen to her answers . <p> 6 . Probe for peoples passions . Then stick to that topic for a while .

The best definition I have heard is : Flirting is the art of making the other person feel beautiful . <p> Theoretically nice , how does one put that into practice ? For those natural and unconscious flirts , they flirt equally with men and women . They smile , make eye contact , unabashedly laugh at jokes and appropriately touch . They , of course , do not feel this is flirting . <p> Some people feel their partner should be giving that attention exclusively to them instead of someone else . What would happen if this viewpoint was expanded to flirting and creates an abundance of good couple energy ? The more positive feelings you share with other people , the more you will get back . <p> One afternoon while having coffee with a friend I explained how I not only encourage my husband to flirt , I teach him the fine art of flirting .

Fair question with a super easy answer : I trust him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband has emerged out his **30;2488;TOOLONG box and flirts , he feels better about himself . He feels and acts sexy .

The irony is he does not really even flirt . Its simply that he has been given a pass-card to flirt that has made all of the difference . <p> I could see my friend nodding her head agreeing . She has known my husband for many years and has seen a definite change in him . Seeing a shift in her belief systems , I went in for the jugular and asked , " Why do n't  you try flirting ? " <p> A tiny look of terror crossed her face . She then uttered the words that many people say when I broach the topic of flirting , " My husband would n't like it .

Is your partner allowed to openly flirt in front of you ? <p> Innocent flirting to me is like window shopping for those in a committed relationship . It is the catalyst to get a spark going in a relationship . To successfully take a healthy relationship over the long term , I strongly believe everyone should flirt . Flirt with each other , flirt with other people , allow other people flirt with them . It creates such great happy couple energy . <p> If flirting is so great , why do people not do it more often ?

Jealousy indicates there is excitement . That said , a well-balanced individual in a healthy relationship will not twist their jealously into a full-blown fight . <p> However , a big part of successful flirting is having a mutual agreement of what is acceptable and unacceptable in your relationship . Which means you must decide what flirting means to you . It is ( here 's that word again ) communicating with your partner . <p> It is best to start out with baby steps . For example , at a party only flirt while your partner is present . Next level , your partner is across the room but in eyes-view .

@@79605060 @1105060/ <p> BigStockPhoto Being loyal to your spouse and finding compromise can be the answer to a merry holiday season . <p> Do you and your spouse always agree about where and with whom to spend the holidays ? If not , then you certainly are n't  alone ; this is a major source of tension for many couples . What should you do if you want to spend Christmas at your parents house , but your spouse wants to spend it with his or her family ? The answer to that is a tricky one , but here are a few tips to help you achieve a win-win situation . <p> 1 . Make your spouse a priority over your parents . Its a simple concept , yet a very difficult one for many people to grasp . On your wedding day , you were supposed to transfer your loyalty from your parents to your spouse . That does n't  mean you were supposed to start being mean to your folks or stop loving them . It just means that your spouses wants , needs and opinions should now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . For example , if your wife wants to start a new tradition by staying home for the holidays ( instead of spending a fortune on travel expenses , packing up the kids , finding a pet-sitter , etc. ) , do n't  tell her she is selfish for not following your mothers traditions . Your behavior plays a key role in how well your spouse gets along with your parents ; it is crucial that you become a loyal husband or wife , even if it makes your mom and dad feel angry lonely , or disappointed . <p> 2 . All you need is love . Spending time with each others familieseven if you do n't  get along with themis part of the marriage commitment . Its a way of showing your spouse that you care about what makes him or her happy . Try to see things from your partners perspective . If you would n't want your husband to refuse to spend time with your family , then do n't  refuse to spend time with his . If your wife knows you do n't  enjoy spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanksgiving with them , she will feel very loved and shell probably do something to make you feel loved too . <p> 3 . Think outside the box . There are usually more options available than you might think . If you want to spend Christmas with your family , but your wife wants to go on a cruise , perhaps a compromise would be to invite your folks on the cruise . Or if you cant decide which set of parents to visit , suggest that both families rent cabins in the mountains . Another option is to stay at a hotel or with friends when visiting each others relatives . <p> 4 . Barter and negotiate . Try to reach a loving compromise so that both of you feel happy with the result . For example , spend Christmas Eve with your own family and Christmas Day with your in-laws . Or spend Thanksgiving with your parents , and Christmas with your wifes folks . Or celebrate this year the way you choose , and next year the way your spouse chooses . You could even lovingly " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or buy your wife that new dress she has been wanting . <p> It can be extremely difficult to settle arguments about family , especially if your parents try to control you with guilt whenever you try to be a loyal spouse . As with any marital conflict , its important to unite as a couple and work together toward the goal of having a strong , loving marriage . <p> Jenna D.

Still , they usually have a long list of deadlines to meet and simply do n't  have time to read the complete survey or research paper .

In many situations , its better to gain respect by standing up for yourself rather than expecting your husband to rescue you . You are not likely to gain your husbands loyalty if you constantly complain to him about his parents ; in fact you can actually trigger his instinct to defend them . Its better to deal with your in-laws in an assertive manner rather than take a passive-aggressive approach . <p> Its respectfulnot disrespectfulfor a daughter-in-law to communicate her needs in a tactful , mature manner . For example , let 's say you hate it when your in-laws make rude comments . What would be disrespectful is if you did n't  tell them how you felt and , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends or held a silent grudge . It would be more respectful to speak honestly and say , " Youre entitled to your opinion , but I 'm not willing to listen to you make negative comments about things like my appearance , my cooking , etc . " <p> Certainly there are situations in which your husband should speak up when his parents are behaving in an unacceptable mannerand as a first approach we recommend that blood talks to blood . However , its important to realize that you have the ability to bring out the best or worst in him . Rather than yelling at him for not being a more loyal husband , its important to consider things from his perspective and work together instead of against each other . <p> There are few things in life more difficult than being assertive with our own parents , especially if they are controlling and manipulative .

A simple card or a heartfelt note is as important as a sweater or new pair of socks . <p> 5 . Communicate . Rather than brooding or giving your spouse the cold shoulder , verbalize your hurt or disappointment in a calm , non-threatening tone of voice . Let your partner know how you are feeling without accusation , resentment or vicious remarks . Throwing a tantrum does little to repair a relationship that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . If you want your spouse to trust you then tell the truth . Period . <p> 7 . Lower your expectations . Rather than comparing your spouse to your friend 's or neighbors ( and he or she always comes out short ) , accept a few thorns with the rose . No one is perfect and the old adage " The grass is always greener " really is true . It is much easier to work on loving your spouse by showing respect , courtesy , affection and attention than it is to battle with your spouse over insignificant details that wo n't matter tomorrow . 113805 @qwx733805

This is called passive aggressive behavior , and it 's not your imaginationit 's very real ! <p> Dealing with this behavior ( passive and unassuming on the surface , but nastily aggressive toward you underneath ) can be incredibly difficult , draining , and frustrating . Fortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also with passive-aggressive daughters-in-lawsand even with passive-aggressive husbands/sons . <p> Daughters-in-Law Dealing with Passive-Aggressive Mothers-in-Law <p> Even though it does n't feel like it , you really do have an advantage . I tell you this not so you can best your in-law , but so you can feel less helpless and start to see the situation in a different light . The following two tips work because they allow you to both alter her behavior and feel better in spite of her actions . After all , it takes two to play , so if you change the rules on your mother-in-law , it 's impossible for her to keep up her frustrating behavior . <p> 1 . Shift the power from her to you with humor . When she tells you she is " fine " but then goes into drama mode , give a good-natured chuckle or laugh in that inside-joke kind of way that tells her you know exactly what she 's doing , but you 're going to ignore the behavior . This allows you to give her a message loud and clear without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take her at face value . Assume that unless she says something directly , she really is fine with whatever you said or did . After all , she ca n't assume you 're a mind reader , right ?

For example , your daughter-in-law may not include you on special family events or she may go into the other room whenever you come by ( or never come out of the other room when you show up ) . <p> 1 . Take a few emotional steps back . Realize what she 's doing to you is , for the most part , not personal . She probably behaves this way with everyone she is upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , if she felt confident enough to deal with people directly , she would n't resort to this behavior , right ? <p> 2 . Be a role model . Instead of slinking away or showing your anger , help her see that having feelings is okay . Help her learn how to express her feelings and get results that are a win-win for both of you . <p> 3 . Acknowledge her feelings even when she wo n't . If she does n't feel it is okay to talk about " bad " feelings , help her see that feelings are just feelings . Stating to her in a calm , compassionate way what you think she 's feeling brings those feelings out into the open . <p> 4 . Help her see you really do want to understand .

Use these concepts to allow conflict to benefit your marriage in the long-term.BY DENISE J. CHARLES <p> DepositPhoto Once you embrace conflict as an act within humanity you will be able to grasp a deeper understanding of the issue . <p> " We fear rejection as a consequence of our honesty , or our fear of exposure forces us to hide behind anger and a false sense of bravado . " <p> Many of us run from conflict . It just seems to be a part of the human psyche . When we do n't agree with an issue , sometimes we skulk away to fume and fuss privately instead of confronting the issue head on . Many of us would never admit that we fear standing up for ourselves because to be bold , strong and assertive is politically correct . This is what is expected of us as well-adjusted adults , so we like to claim these traits as our own . <p> In real life , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated . Some of us can vacillate inconsistently between cowardice and bravado , others can become onerous , aggressive and downright nasty while still others will run away with their tail between their legs . And this is the issue with conflict ; we tend to go to extremes in our response . Either we are holding on to our point of view for dear life , or we are surrendering our right to be heard out of fear . <p> In many instances fear , in fact , dictates and influences each of these extreme reactions . We fear rejection as a consequence of our honesty , or our fear of exposure forces us to hide behind anger and a false sense of bravado . We tend to feel more in control and less like victims when we are either avoiding issues or overreacting to them . So how do we handle marital conflict ? Two separate individuals often with independent points of view must now learn to compromise , draw on each others strengths and allow conflict to push their relationship to a new place of growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we practically learn to live with conflict and use it for our relationship 's benefit ? Perhaps beginning with an understanding of these core concepts , might help . <p> Understand the principle of relationship : Relationships are really about trying to relate in a figurative " ship . " In marriage , obviously , our " ship " is our marriage journey . Hopefully , we share with our spouse the common goal of sailing the wide ocean of life experience together , where the wind and waves do n't destroy us , but actually drive us closer together . In practical terms , this analogy simply underscores that we should share common expectations and goals . If we have as our basis a core understanding of what is really important to us both ; when we know that where our marriage is concerned we are both on the same page , then we need not fear conflict . <p> Accept that some conflict is inevitable : Because conflict is not a barometer of our love , devotion or compatibility , when it occurs we can simply embrace it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no need to become personal or to hold grudges because we can accept that a conflict is just the out-working of our individuality or of our different perspectives . <p> Allow conflict to stretch us from our comfort zone : Sometimes we get stuck in a rut and never grow individually because we are content to see life only through our own lens . We can be self-obsessed to the point where we believe that our way is the only way and this makes us unwilling to compromise . Stepping away from our tunnel vision pushes us to embrace another perspective or at least to respect it even if we do n't agree . <p> Learn to listen between the lines : Depending on the nature of our fight , conflict can sometimes expose our hurts and insecurities . Read the script beneath the argument . Is your spouse expressing pain over some past issue , trying to punish you , or attempting to assert himself/herself after feeling neglected or invisible ? Sometimes the issue is not the issue and we have to open our eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow us to feel greater empathy and open the way for meaningful dialogue . <p> Redefine our relationship through conflict : Conflict is not beneficial if it does not prompt us toward lasting change . This does not mean agreeing constantly about everything , but should mean being more gracious and accepting of our spouse 's individuality . This will hopefully create the context for us to share how we really feel about an issue , without fear of rejection . Respecting differences is about giving each other space to be who we are , but this also dovetails wonderfully to move our marriage to a new place of understanding .

" <p> Becoming a parent is supposed to be an instinctive and natural process , a rite of passage for every woman willing to take that path , but that was not the path that I was destined to take . <p> There was so much I took for granted when my husband Marty and I first decided to start a family using In Vitro Fertilization ( IVF ) . For starters , I just assumed that my body was in tip-top condition and that I would be a wonderful candidate for IVF . That multiple eggs would fertilize and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did fertilize and I did have my son and my daughter , but that was also four IVF cycles later , along with $60,000 cash ( our down payment for our future home ) and a multitude of setbacks and heart-wrenching emotional letdowns . <p> I knew at a young age that I would need to go the IVF route , but at that point in my life having children was not top of my list , so I never really gave it any serious thought . As women , we are n't  educated with any preventative care when it comes to our bodies and getting pregnant . Most gynecologists do n't  tell us that as we get older , and especially after a certain age , the quality of our eggs begins to drop . Or that a relatively inexpensive test can check your FSH ( Follicle Secreting Hormone ) level to determine the exact quality of your eggs . <p> Needless to say , it was quite the eye opener when my first IVF experience went completely awry . For starters , my eggs were no longer top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get pregnant for the first time . Secondly , I had no idea about the actual process ; that is the retrieval process , then the three-day fertilization process , where you could lose more retrieved eggs . So on T-Day ( transfer day ) , what started out as eight retrieved eggs turned into four fertilized eggs and then down to only one viable egg on actual day of transfer . Talk about deflated ! <p> After the failed first attempt , I was faced with two more mind-numbing disappointments but I was also faced with the reality of how I would handle an undesired final outcome and how that outcome would affect my marriage . <p> After the second disappointment , my husband told me that he married me for me , not to have kids . He went on to say that if we created a family , that would be great , but if we did n't  , our life together would still be great . That sounded great , for him . Not for me . First of all , I would have to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what they could n't wait for , especially since all their friends had become grandparents already . Secondly , I could n't remember a time when I did n't  want to be a mother . Since I was 12 years old , I always wanted to be a mommy . here 's the hard truth that no one talks about : if I did n't  become a mom , I was n't entirely certain my marriage would survive . <p> " After the second disappointment , my husband told me that he married me for me , not to have kids That sounded great , for him . Not for me . " <p> By the third disappointment , my husband had very decidedly told me he was not open to adopting or using donor eggs . At that point , I was even more concerned about our marriage surviving because he , at that moment , robbed me of two viable options that would potentially make me a mommy . How could he do this to me , I thought ? More importantly , how would we survive if this last cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dream of becoming a mother ? <p> This is just one of the very real emotions swirling around my head that no one talks about . Now , my husband through all of this was extremely supportive , but he was also very aware of how helpless he really was in this situation . As he mentioned time and time again , I was really the one doing all the " heavy lifting " through this process . After all , I was subjecting my body to drugs and shots , having my blood continually withdrawn and being prodded and poked weekly . He felt helpless and at times hopeless , but I needed him to be strong and forge ahead because I could n't get both myself and him through this . He did just that for me and we got through it . <p> Even though we were together at the appointments and he would give me my progesterone shots in my backside , we were really on two separate journeys and its okay to say that out loud because there is no way the IVF journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there are multiple IVF attempts involved , the level of obsession the woman experiences can be difficult for anyone to wrap their head around . Getting pregnant and the entire IVF process becomes all we think , eat , drink , feel and breathe .

And yet , even if we 've made the list , we tend to focus on the most familiar endeavors first , and then we run out of time and energy for the most important ones . <p> Procrastination is a sly devil that convinces you to put off what you know is crucial , and instead fill your day with busy tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness . If you feel stuck on a treadmill of missed deadlines and opportunities , these four habits will launch you into a new mindset of timely action : <p> 1 . Make a habit of prioritizing tasks . Every evening , write a list of the six most important things to accomplish the following day that will move you toward your big goals , such as making a phone call that would connect you with a possible promotion , or outlining a project you 've dreamed of doing . <p> Ask yourself frequently during the day : Am I moving toward my big goals , or am I spinning in circles with busywork ? Successful people make a habit of doing what is required for progress , not because they enjoy all the top priority tasks , but because they understand the long-term value of doing them anyway . <p> 2 .

" I do n't  know if the poet ever thought that his poetry could ever be used to describe our sex lives but the comparisons are interesting . <p> Our married sex does have a temperature , in fact , just like porridge . There is a climate that defines our marriages in general , which naturally spills over into the bedroom . This climate and the resulting temperature can be sizzling hot , blistering cold , lukewarm , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days or moredefinitely not pleasant to the taste . <p> As much as we would all love to have an enduring and sizzling sex life , most of us know that this is not always realistically possible . While the temperature of our marriages and , by extension , our sex lives will shift and change with time , two things are important to note . We should know where our marriage is located on the thermometer at any given point in time and we should also be equipped to respond to any changes which may be unfavorable . <p> Arctic Chill <p> There are any number of reasons why the sexual temperature in a relationship may run cold . A refusal to deal with deeper issues like anger and unforgiveness or a break-down in communication can all slowly kill a couples desire to connect sexually . Such a relationship may be characterized by very little touching in or outside the bedroom . In the same way that having loads of sex leads to even more sex , sexlessness is also a self-perpetuating behavior . The couple that becomes locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operating at this level and this unfortunately can become their new marital norm . <p> Lukewarm Responses <p> Probably worse than being either cold or hot is the characteristic of being lukewarm . This type of sexual climate is particularly dangerous because a couple can , at times , be fooled into thinking that everything in the relationship is okay . When a couple has developed flawed ways of handling conflict or when there is a lack of honesty in the relationship , sex can become a way of covering up tension . It is assumed that if there is still that sexual-click , then everything else will perhaps fall into place . This , however , is not always the case and , over time , a sexual connection , which has no depth can become eroded . Lukewarmness is also identified when sex becomes run-of-the-mill or routine . A lack of effort or inventiveness can lead to bedroom boredom and the sex , while existent , is not up to scratch in terms of quality ; somewhat like the porridge left lying around for days on end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that , then there is no question we know and love when its hot . A sizzling sexual temperature is identified by a number of qualities that include , but are not limited to the following : sustained physical attraction , loads of sexual tension , sexual spontaneity , planned sexual episodes , sexual variety , sexual satisfaction , playfulness , emotional attraction and sexual inquiry . <p> While this list is by no means exhaustive , these features represent some of the critical areas needed for the sustaining of sexual heat . Are couples who experience this type of sex life simply lucky ? Does fate just bring two people with an irresistible attraction together and the rest is history ? <p> Maintaining the sizzle past the honeymoon and the initial stages of our relationship requires living out our marriages with a certain level of intentionality .

The truth is that the climate of our marriage is unlikely to exist at one continuous , favorable level . Life just is n't like that . Issues like the presence of babies , work pressure , financial challenges , mid-life crises , empty nesting , and illness , can all impact the sexual temperature of our relationships . And of course there is the issue of low desire in either partner , which can also affect how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do when life happens in the midst of a marriage that we are building ? Our response should be based on a certain level of relationship awareness . We cant hope to improve what we are not first aware of . At a very basic level this may require being clear as a couple about our individual sexual expectations at various junctures in the relationship . This is necessary since what we expect may not even be fixed . Ultimately , making adjustments to sexual temperature requires deliberate action on the part of each spouse . This includes communication and a willingness to confront and compromise to meet each others sexual needs for the greater good of the relationship .

It 's perfectly normal for couples to hit speed bumps of various sizes , often times in the communication department . Ideally , couples work on a repair then move on , but sometimes not knowing where to begin to pull things together can feel overwhelming . If there has been damage occurring in the marriage for a long period of time , the mountain of resentment may be steep and tall . The first step is to get back to the basics of good communication , whether its a blip on your marriage radar or a more serious issue . <p> Here are three communication tips to help you and your spouse communicate effectively during moments of relationship derailments : <p> 1 . Stop , listen and breathe . When you feel slighted it can be counter-intuitive to take these three steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend .

When in doubt , clarify . Faulty assumptions made about what the other means by what they said are one of biggest problems for couples . The automatic thinking process happens so quickly , it 's understandable how this occurs . You hear a statement , you make up a negative story of what it means ( assume ) , you have an emotional reaction that is likely unpleasant followed by an unhelpful behavior . The lesson here is before you react to the assumption you 've made , clarify what your spouse meant by the statement . <p> You might say something like , " When you said the pot in the dish drainer was still dirty , I made up a story that I do a terrible job cleaning the house .

Your experience is valid and so is the experience of your spouse . This is something that is easy to forget , especially when conflict arises . Practice validation and empathy for the other by imagining what they might be feeling . Let them know you are trying to understand where they 're coming from , regardless of whether you necessarily agree . The act of attempting to do so will be greatly appreciated . <p> Part of what drives people during conflict is their emotional reactivity .

Is it possible to reach a middle ground and still stay happily married ? <p> It depends on five issues : <p> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tolerate differences is your level of maturity . The more mature a person is , the more able they are to " get out of themselves " and really listen to and respect their partners opinion , without viewing it as a personal attack against them . The ability to keep an open mind without compromising ones beliefs , respecting the others point of view , and being able to agree to disagree , are the keys to having a successful relationship with differing beliefs . People who are immature are typically self-absorbed and believe that their opinions are rightand their partners are wrongend of discussion . <p> 2 . Communication skills . Communication not only includes listening to your spouse and expressing your feelings as honestly and kindly as you can , but also includes the ability to be empathetic and compassionate toward your husband or wife . Stepping in your partners shoes , while putting your opinions aside as you listen , helps your partner feel validated , understood , and heard . Neither spouse may change their mind on the issue , but for each partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My way or the highway " does n't  solve differences ; it only creates distance , defensiveness , and resentment . <p> 3 . Ability to negotiate . If the person 's values and beliefs are so different and rigid from their partners , it will be more difficult to have a healthy relationship . In addition , if the couple is not able to communicate well , they will have a harder time negotiating their differences . By practicing communication skills as stated above , you can start the negotiation process with your spouse . For instance , if the issue is home-schooling vs. public school , and after you each have communicated your views , the possible outcome of your negotiations could be that the child will be home-schooled for one year with the agreement that the couple will discuss the pros and cons of home-schooling vs. public school after that first year . Keep in mind , however , that good negotiations are n't  all about the outcome ; they include being heard and validated during the process . <p> 4 . Kindness . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doubt that theyve got a good idea , although perhaps different than yours , creates good will and trust . When you belittle or judge your partner for what they think , you 're undermining the very foundation of your marriage . Remember , its not so much the disagreements that can put a wedge in the relationship ; its how you go about disagreeing . With maturity and good communication skills , arguments can be resolved with respect and kindness . <p> 5 . Unresolved issues . Are there any unresolved issues in the marriage that could be escalating your differences even further ? For example , a woman feels like her husband does n't take her seriously because she 's had less education than he has . She frequently feels put down and minimized by him because he s often self-righteous and condescending . Once they start disagreeing about home-schooling , for example , his know-it-all attitude escalates , and her insecurity about her education also escalates , causing a hostile disagreement . Now , every word is used as a weapon to hurt each other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument they 've had prior to this will be present in the discussion about home-schooling . Therefore , the more you resolve past issues and know your trigger points , the less likely disagreements will turn into hurtful shouting matches . <p> If you really love someone , but you do n't see eye-to-eye , it does n't  mean your differences are irreconcilable . Use your diametrically opposing views as an opportunity to turn a potentially divisive and destructive conversation into one of hearing , dialoguing , seeing another perspective , and learning about each other . 113804 @qwx733804

" <p> We seem to prepare for everything in our life : jobs , exams , etc . Why then do n't  we prepare for a successful marriage ? According to the State of Our Unions report from the National Marriage Project , it is estimated that between 40 and 50 percent of first marriages end in divorce in the United States . Without realizing it , most couples have unrealistic ideas about marriage perpetuated by fairy tales , movies , and fantasy novels .

What should you wear ? How should you pose ? Taking sexy photos at home is a snap , as long as you keep a few simple rules in mind .

Costumes are usually a good choice because they allow you to start off slowly and get used to the camera before stripping everything away . They also allow you play around a bit , leading to other things . Also , try playing around with props . You can get fancy and purchase kinky items such as whips and paddles at a porn store , or play around with stuff at home ; simply straddling your kitchen chair is sexier than you think .

Most professional photographers shoot their models either just after sunrise or just before sunset . <p> Camera Digital cameras have tons of settings to make your pictures turn out just as good as the professionals . If you 've never tried photography , stick to the automatic settings ; but if you 're familiar with your camera , try playing with the features and manipulating settings such as F-Stops and Iso , which control your shutter speed and how much light your camera let 's in . <p> Action Once you get over the initial nervousness of being photographed , have fun !

It turns out that really well written books rely much less on a specific voice ( that I had long believed was conveyed by my choice of language ) , but by how concise and clear the writing is so that the ideas can be illuminated .

If you and your spouse like coffee or tea , add color to the saucer by tinting sugar cubes with a hint of pink or red food coloring . Place a tiny red rose by each place setting . <p> Tip : You do n't  need to reserve candles just for special evening dinners ! Candles at breakfast add a sense of romance and calm that starts the day in an especially lovely way . <p> 5 . The Valentine Lunch Carve out time for that far-too-infrequent lunch together .

The Dinner Basket This idea all but creates itself . Purchase a lovely , sturdy basket ( or use one you already have at home ) and make a trip to your favorite grocery store .

Dr. Trina Read explains why drug companies may be educating the public on a problem that ca n't be cured with a pill.BY DR . TRINA READ <p> DepositPhoto While it would be nice to pop a pill and be in the mood , it 's just not that simple . <p> " Moreover , studies confirm women mostly accept or initiate for reasons other than desiresuch as to increase emotional bonding , or a response to romantic setting . " <p> Low libido one of the most common problems presented in sex therapy . It is estimated that approximately 20 percent of men and 33 percent of women are affected by low or absent sexual desire , and now drug companies are working to create a " pink Viagra " to boost women 's libido . But are drug companies working to sell a product women do n't  need ? And is there anything inherently wrong with drug companies wanting to help women with a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug companies to get a female libido enhancing " pink Viagra " to market could , of course , mean billions of dollars in shareholder profit . In the long line of attempts over the years , pills to correct low libido is back in the news . <p> Several years ago a drug called Flibanserin was developed ; however , the drug company dropped efforts in 2010 after being declined by the FDA who requested more research . A smaller company took the work over in 2011 . They resubmitted an application recently and were once again declined by the FDA . <p> In the meantime , I noticed this past year many credible news releases talking about a condition called : hypoactive sexual desire disorder or HSDD . Although this is purely speculation , it seems some companies are doing the necessary behind-the-scenes PR before unveiling a new drug . Let me explain my skepticism : <p> Why do you say HSDD is no longer a " real condition ? " In the The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM 5 , released in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced HSDD with sexual interest/arousal disorder . A big reason why it was replaced is the condition of HSDD had too broad a definition , " An absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity . " This is in part because HSDD model was derived from studies on predominantly male subjects . <p> How is it the terminology has changed but the thinking around HSDD is still the same ? HSDD was based on a linear male model , stating desire precedes arousal in the form of fantasizing , yearning , and looking forward to the experiencea.k.a. " spontaneous " desire . The problem is this framework is infrequent in many functional and satisfied women , especially those in established relationships . <p> For many women arousal is responsive , occurring at some point after she has chosen to engage in the experience . Moreover , studies confirm women mostly accept or initiate for reasons other than desiresuch as to increase emotional bonding , or a response to romantic setting . <p> Which calls into question : is the estimated number of women with a desire disorder really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than responsive desire . <p> Have the pharmaceutical companies over diagnosed low libido by relying too heavily on the condition of HSDD ? That 's exactly it . In 1998 when Viagra came on the scene , it was a credible product because it helped male sexual dysfunction . Drug companies knew they needed a female sexual dysfunction condition to credibly sell her a product . Which is why they ran with the HSDD model . <p> Let 's be real , there are many desperate women who would love after an endless day of work , taking the kids to soccer , making supper and cleaning up , to simply take a pill and be in the mood for sex . Currently non-FDA approved libido enhancing drugs are a major dollar industry . <p> In trying to seize this opportunity what we see from drug companies are a well orchestrated marketing blitz , which has little to do with science . Even though data has n't been released and no breakthroughs have been discovered , what the public hears through news releases is : women with a lack of desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within their relationship . <p> What we need to ask is : why are drug companies investing heavily in research , surveys and patient registries to indicate there is a disorder , while at the same time creating medication to treat this condition . <p> But a lack of desire is a big , contentious issue for couples . You 're right . Sexual desire is elusive and a difficult thing to defineif we had a thousand people in a room , each would present a different sexual desire . Lack of libido is not a simple checklist of things , and if you check all the boxes you can be prescribed medication . <p> Many women and men do report dissatisfaction with sex , but that does not mean they are dysfunctional . More likely it is due to a variety of interrelated factorsphysical , psychological and social . <p> Men and women do experience sexual problems causing them distress , discomfort and dissatisfaction . Although they need attention it is neither a clinical condition nor dysfunction , and it is wrong for drug companies to manufacture a precondition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a womens libido ? Because there is so little factual sex education in our society , we are instead bombarded with Cosmo-type titillating articles about how to improve your sex life and it leaves the majority feeling that if you have low libido you are abnormal . When in truth , there are so many obstacles getting in the way to feel spontaneous or even responsive desire . <p> Something as simple as : if you 've had a fight in the morning , chances are no nookie will happen that night . Other things that heavily contribute are : do you have good communication with your partner ? Do you have a healthy sexual self esteem ? What were the messages in your upbringing ? <p> There are also external things like : birth control pills , antidepressants , allergy mediations , alcohol , high cholesterol , and thyroid problems .

TRINA READ <p> BigStockPhoto Men can name their penis , why ca n't women name their vaginas ? <p> As homework for a womens sexuality workshop , I instructed each woman to come to the next class with a drawn representation of her vagina . The silence was deafening . <p> From the groups facial expressions , I gathered a feeling of , " You not only want me to draw my private parts , but then I am supposed to bring my illustration to the workshop to show everyone ? That 's a little too bizarre for me . Thanks , but I 'll pass . " <p> Sensing the dread , I decided to play devils advocate . I asked the group , " Given that most of us have limited drawing ability , how would you feel if I had requested you draw your right hand ? " I then added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body like your hand then drawing another part of your body ? Your vagina is simply one part of your body . " The group was still not convinced and a few vocalized their distaste for the exercise . <p> Of course , the story ends happily . Every woman came to the next class with her picture and an account of how this small exercise was a life-changing experience . Why ? Most of my participants did not realize how they shut down that area of their body . They all agreed this disconnect from their vagina significantly impacted their sexuality . <p> Women in general have a pretty twisted sense of body image . Those insecurities are personified when it comes to their vaginas . My own presex expert introduction to this idea came when The Vagina Monologues came to town . <p> I remember reading the shows program and thinking it strange that each cast member not only named her vagina but also described what it would wear .

At that time , I could not even say the word " vagina " out loud . <p> Naming my vagina ? Asking what it would wear ? Never had such a thing occurred to me . Yet , men have a very intimate relationship with their penises and its size ( see : Battle of the Bulge ) many a penis has a name and its own distinct personality . <p> The late sexologist Mary Calderone , M.D. , coined the phrase " a womens doughnut hole sensibility .

Victorian era women went even further and changed under floor-length flannel gowns to avoid exposing their genitals . <p> Even today , women have an unconscious need to hide their privates . When I am changing in the gym locker room , it is rare to see a woman walking around naked . As well , girlfriends have expressed the uncomfortable feeling of having an internal exam by a gynecologist . <p> Unfortunately , media play up on our crotch insecurities . I have lost count of how many subjective advertisements ask me if I am clean and hairless . Do I smell right ? If not , I should immediately buy a lightly scented panty liner . <p> Ladies , your vagina is not some mystical wonderland you get to visit only while having sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your anatomy .

Rolled pork loin . <p> Note : There was a thin layer of fat on the outside of the loin . I left this there as a bit of protection to keep the loin from drying out .

Worry is an alarm that asks : <p> " What 's the plan for avoiding this situation ? Are you going to beat yourself up again and cause more anxiety and depression ?

Our fears are seldom about what is reasonable . While some therapies tell you to argue or debate with irrational fears , I have found it more effective to honor the concern and offer a plan for survival and the maintenance of self-worth . <p> Think about what you would do if a negative event occurred . Face it . Take a few minutes to imagine your usual responses and how you will recover from panic , feeling overwhelmed and self-criticism . Know whom you might call for help . Make a plan that prepares your brain with the neural connections to shift from fear to effective action . <p> Even better , practice using a " generic plan " of giving yourself unconditional acceptance regardless of what happens . Do this every day to lower stress and anxiety and have it in place before a dangerous situation happens . Be prepared to calm your mind and body by saying to yourself , " Regardless of what happens , I will not make you feel bad . I will not abandon you . You and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're holding a frightened or sick infant over your heart . Lightly pat yourself as if you 're patting that infant on the back saying , " Yes , yes , I 'm here .

" <p> Whether its your first year of marriage , 10th or beyond you know that conflicting goals can put a major crimp in the operations of your relationship . Disagreements about finances , friends , vacation plans and which way the toilet paper roll should face can put snags in an otherwise smooth relational fabric . <p> Disagreements are inevitable . Like money , conflicts are neither good nor bad . How you manage conflicts determines the impact on your relationship . When managed poorly , conflicts tear at the relational fabric . When managed well , the seams are stronger than ever . <p> In my conversations with couples in conflict , I find that each tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse defines a good relationship ; and metaphors help us express our underlying beliefs . Asking one another to define how a good relationship is like a path exposes these three groups . <p> The Single Path Partner : " We walk hand-in-hand on the same path . " <p> The Single Path Partner thinks both individuals should be alike in their needs and desires . <p> Childhood fairytales promote the idea of meeting Prince Charming or Princess Snow White and living happily ever after in perfect bliss . People in this group often tell me , " I want to be with someone who thinks like I dowe will walk the same path side-by-side for the rest of our lives . " <p> Its a nice image . However , we all invariably discover that we are not the same person as our spouse . We want something they do n't  want and they want something we do n't  want . <p> The first time this happens represents a volatile point in the relationship and the two of you may ask yourselves : " Does this mean we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same path ? " " Are you the person I thought you were ? " " Where do we go from here ? ! " <p> The Parallel Path Partner : " We walk side-by-side on parallel paths . " <p> The Parallel Path Partner wants to please the other but recognizes the need to guard their own boundaries too . <p> People in this group value both their goals and their spouses goals . They have developed a sense of their own needs and desires and know where their hard and soft boundaries lie . They know where to compromise and where to stand firm . They believe that a healthy relationship requires an equal commitment to personal goals and awareness of boundaries and say things like : " I would like to spend the day cleaning the garage . How does that fit with your plans ? " " What kind of work would you like to be doing ? " " How can we do this in a way that works for both of us ? " <p> My Path Partners are accustomed to doing things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong personality , a desire to control , fear of uncertainty , a belief in the " rightness " of their way , or a variety of other reasons . The bottom line is that My Path Partners have a difficult time honoring the needs of their spouse when those needs conflict with their own desires . <p> In many cases , My Path Partners are motivated by a belief that they are showing care and love for their spouse . Since they know best and wish to keep their partner safe and happy , they impose their wishes with the very best of intentions and will carry them out and tell you : " I 've picked the best route for our roadtrip . " " Were hosting a party next weekend . The invitations have already been sent . " " You 're doing it wrong . You should " and so on . <p> Combination Characteristics <p> Which group do you most identify with ? Which group do you think your spouse represents ? Here are some possible combinations . <p> Single Path Partner with Parallel Path Partner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parallel Path Partner , you may find yourself struggling to maintain your boundaries . You attempt to walk side-by-side on parallel paths while your spouse attempts to find ways to merge your paths . They expect you to have the same needs and desires as they do . If you are the Single Path Partner in this pairing , you may see your partners resistance as a lack of love or commitment to you . Is this a sign they are not on the same path ? This may feel quite confusing and threatening to you . <p> Parallel Path Partner with My Path Partner . What if you are a Parallel Path Partner and your significant other is a My Path Partner ? You may believe your spouse is unfairly imposing her will on you and not granting you freedom and independence . If you are the My Path Partner , you may believe you are showing love and respect to your spouse through your leadership , guidance and protection . You likely find your partners resistance irritating and disrespectful . This combination can result in frustration for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Path Partners . The result here is sometimes a codependent relationship . In order to preserve the illusion of unity , the Single Path Partner may work diligently to mirror the needs and desires of the My Path Partner . Over time , the Single Path Partner may resent the sacrifices he has made to maintain the relationship . The My Way partner can view these changes as threatening because they upset the relationship balance . <p> Two Single Path Partners : At the outset , the future looks rosy to this couple . They imagine they will easily satisfy one anothers needs and desires . They think they will rarely face conflict because they are " perfect " for each other . Imagine their surprise the first time they disagree about childrearing or spiritual values or whether to buy a Ford or Chevy . In many cases , these types flounder as they seek together to return to a common path . <p> Two My Path Partners : Two My Path Partners frequently find themselves in power struggles . Misunderstandings can also result as each spouse pursues individual interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Path Partners : These folks have found a healthy way to balance the needs of their relationship , of their spouse and of themselves . When both partners in a couple are in this group and have compatible communication styles and skills , they will do well . In fact , these couples may define their relationship as " perfect " because they are able to manage agreements and disagreements in a manner that strengthens the relationship and one another at the same time . <p> With the exception of Parallel Path couples , when group characteristics are extremely entrenched , relationships sometimes come to an end . Fortunately , there is hope for couples with all these combinations . Skilled therapy , coaching or mediation can help them collaboratively define the type of relationship they wish to create together and the means to do it . <p> Advice For Each Group <p> Whichever group you represent , you can take steps to strengthen your marriage . <p> Recommendations for Single Path Partners* Expect your spouses needs and desires to differ from yours. * Practice viewing the differences in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * Seek complementarities with your spouse rather than similarities . * Grant your spouse the freedom to be themselves to the extent that it does not harm you . * Seek help from trusted advisors ( therapist , coach , mediator , etc. ) in defining your unique identity and boundaries . * Recognize that expecting him or her to satisfy your needs is unreasonable . Neither you nor your spouse can satisfy all the needs in a marriage . <p> Recommendations for Parallel Path Partners* Develop practices that test and reinforce your motivations and boundaries . * Learn communication skills to help negotiate your interests with your spouse in a way that puts the least stress on the relationship . * If your partner is in another group , consider whether a trusted advisor ( therapist , coach , mediator , etc. ) might help the two of you collaboratively define how your relationship will be . <p> Recommendations for My Path Partners* Recognize that truly loving another means understanding that persons needs and desires . You may not choose to fulfill them , but you should respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated with respect. * Consider how you can provide leadership by collaborating . * When you sense ongoing resistance , consider whether a trusted advisor ( therapist , coach , mediator , etc. ) can help the two of you adapt to one anothers styles . * Brainstorm the conflicts you are likely to face . Together , plan ahead on how you will handle them in a manner that makes you both comfortable . <p> Relationships take a great deal of attention . We all tend to believe that our significant other sees things as we do or should . In fact , each of us sees the world through different eyes . We define good relationships in different ways . <p> Challenging ? Yes . Worth the effort ?

If you cant remember , its been too long . " <p> It kind of boggles my mind when I read articles about the difficulties couples are faced with today . If you search the Internet or read the " Dear Miss Lonely Hearts " column , lack of communication in relationships seems to be a consistent issue causing problems on the home front . <p> I have a hard time wrapping my mind around that one because in the majority of cases that 's not something that usually happens overnight . I would bet the entire farm there were signs of trouble on the horizon before any couple finds themselves walking down Splitzville Avenue . <p> Here are some symptoms and suggested remedies that could help heal what 's ailing the communication between partners : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red flag , especially if its out of character for your spouse . If your easy-going spouse seems to be getting irritated quickly then somethings up . Try approaching your mate calmly and say , " Hey babe , do you know where I could find my partner because they seem to be missing in action lately ? " Keeping it light , loving and caring will help put your spouse at ease to tell you what 's on their mind . <p> Symptom 2 : Withdrawn and Distant . A good majority of people are stressed due to career and/or financial pressures . Its not uncommon for people to pull back or get really quiet when they are stressed out . A simple thing , like putting your hand on theirs and saying as you look directly into their eyes is , " I 'm always here for you . I 'd love to listen to whatever you have to say whenever you want to talk about it . " The tone and non-demanding action will help create a comfortable space to make it more inviting for them to start the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we know our partners well enough to notice when something is off kilter . Instead of trying to guess what that " something " could possibly be we should come right out and ask our partner if they sense it too . Better to get the information directly from the source than to allow our imagination to get the best of us . Checking in with our mate is demonstrating that we are paying attention to them and to the overall health of the marriage . <p> Symptom 4 : Kids Rule the Roost . When was the last time you and your spouse had a conversation about yourselves ? If you cant remember , its been too long . Find a place in your home where the topic of kids is taboo . I know its tough but it can be done . Agree that this designated " No Kids " zone will be the one place reserved just for the two of you . Ensuring that Mommy and Daddy are happy and healthy will benefit everyone living under that roof . <p> Its been said that relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it dies , and if you catch it loosely , it flies , but if you catch it with tenderness , it remains with you forever . <p> Cancer took Kim Malchuks husband , but not the enduring spirit of their love .

Why werent you able to have a discussion instead of a fight ? What was your part in escalating things to the yelling and screaming stage ? Did you launch into an attack on your spouse rather than coming to him with a calm , " We have something we need to look at " approach ? Did you respond defensively to his , " You totally blew our budget ! " with a foot-stomping " Did not ! " ? <p> What was his part ? Did he react defensively to your attack ? Did he fly off the handle at your , " Did not ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours to work on . Do that , work on it , forgive yourself , forgive him and move on .

" <p> When you got married and said , " I Do , " chances are you were thinking that you always would ... " do it , " I mean . <p> Totally taken by the idea of endless nights of unbridled passion during the honeymoon phase of your relationship , I 'm sure that the thought of a gradually waning sex drive seemed like a very distant and unlikely possibility . After all , the powerful physical attraction for your spouse , along with those wonderful personality traits , was why you decided to get hitched in the first place . And of course you had already heard all of the possible downsides of marriage but things like the " four-year itch , " bedroom-boredom , falling out of love and the distinct probability of your spouse growing on your nerves , seemed pretty far-fetched to you . This was stuff that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love as you and your partner are . <p> But life happened . The honeymoon phase , which could last anywhere up until the first three years of marriage , eventually passed and things have not been the same sinceespecially in the sex department . <p> While each of our couple stories might not read like a well-worn novel , we are all likely to navigate similar relationship phases . Because of all the hype continuously given to sex and its importance in intimate relationships , many of us are ill-prepared for a case of the sexual doldrums . We usually do n't  know how to cope when we feel so exhausted or our minds are so caught-up with some issue at workthat the idea of passionate sex can seem like a bothersome encroachment on our time . <p> The reality is that the pace of life , financial pressures , our jobs , having a baby , dealing with toddlers , battling adolescents , coping with aging parents and the like can take a toll on our desire for sex . Even when we continue to " do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow dance done in autopilot . In other words , it can become booooring with a capital " B. " What this lack of sexual inventiveness and paling passion can mean is that we can get stuck in a sexual rut which plays havoc with our once kicking sex-drive . Its like the chicken and egg conundrum . The lessening of sex further decreases our sex-drive , and the depleted sex-drive weakens our desire for sex . So it becomes a vicious cycle and were never quite sure where it started . <p> So how do we pick ourselves up from the figurative ground zero of our relationships ? We just may need to bite the bullet and put some critical emergency strategies in place to jumpstart our crashed sex-drive . <p> Think on these things . For those of us who enjoy or have enjoyed great sex , we know that the mind or thought-life plays a vital role . If we hope to increase our interest in sex then this may mean taking some time to flood our minds with sexual thoughts . And while I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should use our brains and imaginations to relive past great sexual experiences with our spouse or to invent those we want to pursue . We cant have sex with an empty mind and the brain has not been labeled our most vital sexual organ without merit . We should therefore learn to use it to our advantage . Thinking about sex can also involve reading great articles or watching informative videos , which can educate and allow us to know where we need to step it up a notch or two . The point here is that the mind should not be allowed to atrophy and to become sexless . <p> Look the part . There is such a thing as dressing sexy . Our image says a lot about how we view ourselves and can play a great part in stoking those feel-good hormones , which can , in turn , influence our feeling of sexiness . There is nothing like a changed outfit , a new fragrance , a makeover or a new hairdo to transmit the idea that we are sexy and desirable . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this should not stop us from bringing surprise elements to the relationship , including the way we look . This also holds true for men who may want to get their sexual groove on by beefing things up in the gym . If we look like crap , chances are we will feel like crap and will have crappy sex or none at all . <p> Speak the words . There is no doubt about it : words are powerful . Words affect our perceptions and shape our feelings . Sharing sexy words can be a great way for a sex-starved couple to reconnect . This can be done in tandem or alone . Obviously , if you whisper to each other all the hot things you missed doing , this may get you both going , but one partner can also initiate the sex-talk . These words can be flowery , poetic and romantic like an old love letter or they can be spicy and graphic like a heated novel . They can be written , spoken or both . Whatever the case , using the language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a flagging marriageall that is required is that we open our mouths or pick up our pens . <p> Jump in the deep-end . So youve not had sex in a while or your interest in sex has waned and you want to know how to solve this problem . Try having sex for starters . Jump in and like the old Nike ad suggested , " Just do it . " Research has shown that the more we have sex , the more sex we want to have . Connecting sexually allows the attachment hormone , oxytocin , to strengthen our bond and we usually desire to do this again . Sex can be mood altering when we learn to surrender to the moment . So shying away from sex because we are waiting for a great " magic moment " may actually be counter productive . Take the plunge , despite the way you feel , and you just may be surprised by the results . <p> Seek wise counsel . There may be serious hidden or known issues which are influencing your lack of sexual desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like abuse , infidelity or past individual trauma may need to be uncovered and resolution or healing sought . This may require the services of a counselor , pastor or therapist . If your depleted sex drive is as a result of a deep emotional wound , then the " jump-start " process may mean a bold decision to confront personal/couple pain . While this may not bring immediate resolution , it can be the starting point towards a renewed sexual relationship .

@@79605108 @1105108/ <p> Separation or Divorce : Pros and Cons of a Critical Choice There are legal considerations to mull when your marriage is on the rocks.BY LAWRENCE R. JONES <p> What is the difference between a separation and a divorce ? With a separation , you may be living in a different residence than your spouse , but you are still legally married . With a divorce , the marriage is legally over , even if you still happen to be living with your ex . A person may seek a separation instead of a divorce , or vice versa , for various reasons . Five common considerations include the following : <p> 1 . Genuine Possibility of Saving the Marriage : If you want to live separate from your spouse , but believe that there is a reasonable chance of saving the marriage , through counseling or otherwise , then consider a separation instead of a divorce . Of course , some people reconcile and even re-marry each other after divorce . Meanwhile , you may have spent substantial time and money unnecessarily by jumping the gun to divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the fact . <p> 2 . Health Insurance : A frequent reason why some people do not choose to divorce is because they wish to stay on their spouses work-related family health insurance plan . Generally , an ex-spouse does not qualify as a family member following divorce , but in some instances may " COBRA " the health insurance benefits at a price which for many people is very expensive and cost-prohibitive . COBRA stands for " Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act " and is a federal law that may allow you to temporarily keep health coverageyou pay 100% of the premiums plus a small administration fee . <p> If , however , the parties are separated but still married , it is possible , but not guaranteed that the non-employed spouse may remain on the policy . Some policies now contain provisions which excludes coverage following separation , or what is referred to in some states as a " divorce from bed and board . " Therefore , if health insurance is a concern , it is important to first carefully check the specific language of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation may affect your coverage . <p> 3 . Joint Income Tax Filings : Another reason some couples prefer separation over divorce is if they are still technically married they may be able to file a joint tax return by mutual arrangement , and share any resulting refund . Some people may do substantially better on their tax returns by filing jointly instead of separately . Other people , however , choose not to file a joint return , particularly if a spouses purported income is questionable or lacking in credibility . <p> 4 . Unequivocal Desire to End Marriage : Some people are so absolutely certain of their desire to end a marriage that they want a divorce yesterday . They do not want to spend additional time , money , and energies delaying the inevitable by first undergoing a lengthy trial separation , and may in fact have been planning a divorce for a long time . <p> 5 . Establish " End of Marriage " Date : Some people prefer filing for divorce in an effort to establish an " end of marriage " date . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parties marriage is not the date of the judgment of divorce , but the date of filing the complaint for divorce . For example , if parties have been married for exactly nine years , and they then separate and live apart for two years before either party files a complaint for divorce , a court may possibly consider the marriage to have been 11 years rather than 9 years in length . The marriage length can potentially impact issues such as alimony , and may also possibly affect the distribution of assets acquired during the period after separation , which is considered part of the marriage . While a couple can agree to a different cutoff date , such as the date of the separation , this may potentially require the consent of both parties or decree of the court based upon specific factual circumstances . <p> There may be other personal considerations on the issue of separation versus divorce . Sometimes , parties start off in divorce litigation , but decide before conclusion to dismiss the matter and either stay separated under a written agreement or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counseling . <p> Any person who is unsure whether to seek a divorce , either before or after separating , should logically consult in confidence with an attorney regarding the pros and cons of each potential choice . Moreover , many marriages can potentially be savedand perhaps even strengthened through the addressing of previously ignored issuesif both parties give each other a reasonable opportunity to do so . <p> Lawrence Jones is a contributing columnist and former Judge of the New Jersey Superior Court until his retirement from the bench in 2017 .

Although many of us enjoy receiving physical gifts , the gifts that I am presenting to you today are n't physical objects and do n't cost a dime . <p> Whether you 're in a relationship with a man or a woman , these gifts are gender neutral .

Of course you have n't because you 're an alien . <p> Knowing that we all deal with insecurities and battle negative self-talk gives us the perfect opportunity to create a gift for our partner out of thin air . <p> Here 's how the gift works : Focus on the things you admire about your spouse . This is especially useful if there is tension in the marriage and you find yourself focusing on the things you dislike about that person . <p> Every time you notice yourself focusing on things you dislike about your partnerthings that you wish were n't there or that you wish they would improveplace your attention on something you do appreciate about your husband or wife . <p> When someone is feeling negatively judged , they are less likely to change and typically shut down .

Dedication : I have found that when I usually bring up the topic of dedication , most people think of being loyal . Although I would say that 's definitely a big part , I 'm going to delve into the topic a bit deeper . <p> When I speak of dedication , I am speaking of a dedication to being the best partner you can be . It means bringing awareness to , and taking responsibility for projecting your own insecurities and negative beliefs onto your spouse . <p> It means tuning into your husband or wife and finding the most effective way to communicate with them because communication is at the core of any marriage . It also means a dedication to working through issues that arise and not running away from them . <p> The gift of dedication is a commitment to being the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : To explain this gift , I reference the world of acting . If you were to watch a movie and the actor was n't really feeling their role , it would show .

Focused love means really listening to what your partner is saying without desiring to say something in response before they have finished . It means placing all of our attention on them when we are with them in a conversation or an embrace . <p> We may find it difficult to be fully present with our busy lives and busy minds , but if we take just a little bit of time when we are together to be fully present and focus our love on our partner , we would see our connections grow much deeper . <p> The gift of focused love brings with it peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loomis is a relationship coach and is passionate about creating inspiring conversations around romantic love .

If you respectfully confront them , they will likely overreact and use the situation as a way to draw pity from their offspring in order to turn them against you . If you hold your ground as they sulk , pout , whine , cry and blame , they will probably change their behavior , although theyll complain about having to do so . <p> Type 5 In-laws : These in-laws say they want a better relationship with you , but then ignore every suggestion you give on how to change their behavior .

" <p> Whether you 've been working out forever or you are first-timer , you need to know the dos and donts for gym etiquette . Here are 11 tips to help you be a pro both inside and outside this year ! <p> 1 . Do dress appropriately . Wearing the appropriate workout attire means you feel your best , and therefore are able to get a better workout . If you are wearing too baggy clothing you will be distracted by your clothes catching on a weight , or too revealing is distracting and comes across as a bit desperate for attention . Neither are good starts to a great workout . <p> 2 . Do n't  drop the weights . If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong enough to get them back down to the ground in a safe location so others do n't  trip over them . In other words , put away your " toys " after you play with them by re-racking the weights after using them . <p> 3 . Do n't  save a machine . If your friend is getting a drink of water , that 's one thing , but putting your towel on the treadmill to " save " it for someone that may or may not show up is impolite . Share the equipment and allow other guests to work in with you . If there is a time limit on a machine , get off and move on when your time is up . <p> 4 . Do mind your own business . Giving unsolicited advice may be taken with appreciation or a grain of salt . Unless someone is in danger of hurting himself or herself , keep your instruction and step-by-step tutorials to yourself . <p> 5 . Do n't  stare . Overtly checking someone out is nothing short of creepy . Equally off-putting is watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way through the gym and back to the locker room . You look the same in every mirror ! <p> 6 . Do n't  sing . When listening to your favorite music with your ear buds securely in place , remember you are probably singing along at a louder decibel ( or two ) than you may think . <p> 7 . Do wipe down the machine before moving on . Preferably not the same towel you use to wipe your face and body . Its worth investing in a pack of fitness towels with a germ shield . Use the disinfectant the gym provides specifically for this purpose . <p> 8 . Do back up . Respect other peoples personal space and take a step back while waiting for the weights or machine . If someone is stretching before a class or has placed their mat down for yoga , move your mat over so the other person has room to move freely without hitting you in the head with their foot . <p> 9 . Do n't  use the pool as your shower . Soap and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do , do n't  forget deodorant . Its better to smell fresh as a daisy , rather than stale as an ashtray . On the other hand , do n't  over use the cologne or scented lotionjust come in smelling clean . <p> 10 . Do n't  spit in the sink . Guysdont even think about spitting in the shower , water fountain or sink . And , keep your gum in your mouth until you find a trash can . The water fountain is not the place to leave it behind . <p> 11 . Do leave your cell phone in your gym bag ( safely locked up in the locker room ) . Do n't  carry your cell phone around with you while you lift weights or put it on the side of the basketball court while you play a quick game and then complain when it turns up missing or stolen . <p> Outdoor Fitness Etiquette &amp; Tips <p> 1 . Stay on track . If you are using a public area to run , bike or jog , but want to take a shortcut back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the golf course . Also , steer clear of areas that are close to children , or even remotely populated when you feel the immediate need to relieve yourself and cant wait another moment . <p> 2 . Plan for dusk and dawn . It might be more convenient to take your daily run in the early morning or late night hours , but keep in mind the limited visibility of oncoming traffic . Wear reflective clothing and use reflectors if you plan a midnight bike ride ( which I advise against for safety reasons ) . Do n't  forget to wear your bike helmet and include a reflector or light . <p> 3 . Obey traffic laws and be respectful of drivers and pedestrians . Utilize all pedestrian crossings and stop at stop signs if you are on a recreational vehicle . Keep in mind that you are responsible for other peoples safety as much as they are responsible for yours . Do n't  surprise a walker from behind or expect a driver to veer off the road to accommodate you . <p> 4 . Clean up after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or walk with your dog , bring along some plastic bags for your dogs waste . <p> 5 . Walk single file . If you are walking with a group of people , when you see someone walking toward you , allow them to pass by doubling up or walking single file , rather than making them step off onto the grass to allow your entire group to stay together . Its really very rude ! <p> 6 . No littering . Those plastic water bottles wont throw themselves away and dropping one on the side of the road or in someones yard and committing to circle back and pick it up never happens . <p> 7 . Dress in layers . There may be a chill in the air when you leave the house , but you will quickly warm up when you start moving .

A tactful , non-antagonistic way to say this would be , " I 'd like for us to start having a healthier relationship with each other , so from now on , let 's talk to each other directly when a problem comes up , rather than gossiping to others . " If there are times when you need advice about what to say to your mother-in-law , or you just need to vent your anger in a healthy way , meet with a counselor or join a support group ( You can join my support group and/or find a list of recommended counselors on my website at www.WifeGuide.org . ) <p> You can also apply this advice to sisters-in-law , aunts , grandmas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 've decided to start practicing healthier behavior , so I 'm going to stop gossiping to you about my mother-in-law .

When your marriage spat is over , your family will likely hold a grudge against your spouse long after you 've forgiven them for whatever they did . <p> Unfortunately , very few of us have good role models when it comes to gossip .

And these are not older peoplethe group surveyed was between the ages of 16-21 ! <p> What can be the cause of these issues ? I believe it is partly due to the fundamental misunderstandings that exist between men and women , as well as the fact that so many people have harmful or incorrect views of sex and love . <p> Here are my top tips for safeguarding your relationship inside and outside the bedroom : <p> 1 . Sex does n't  necessarily mean orgasm . So many men avoid having sex because they have fears of premature ejaculation or losing their erection . We need to change the way we think about sexit is n't about reaching a specific destination or following a set map , such as foreplay , intercourse or cuddling . If you are simply in the moment and conscious of your body , you can allow things to happen , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , touch your partner and be touched . Stay aware . Notice what is happening . Let the rest go . The most important thing is the connection between you and your spouse , and that you are both emotionally present . <p> 2 . Men and women should n't always be equal . Being on level ground is good when it comes to the boardroom , but when it comes to our relationships , equality is not the best thing to seek . Things wont always be fair between you . Sometimes one of you might have a bad week at work , and the other partner might have to pick up the slack . Or one of you might be sick and need caretaking . Do n't  keep records of who does more for the other person , or who 's " turn " it is to serve the other . <p> 3 . You do n't need your partners participation to change your relationship . You can actually change your relationship without your spouse even being aware you are making a change . That 's because true change happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than simply donning a sexy new bra or scheduling a date night . <p> 4 . Your spouse does n't need to please you . We need to stop thinking that men give women orgasms . No wonder so many men struggle with anxiety in the bedroom . Orgasms are n't  something to be bestowed upon us . Ladies , we are the ones in charge of creating our own pleasure . That means learning what turns you on and then sharing that with your husbandhe is not a mind reader . <p> 5 . Do n't let your spouse 's bad mood effect you . We think that when our partner has a bad day , its normal to get upset and reflect that same emotional mood . Not so . The most helpful and kind thing you can do is maintain your own energetic state and radiate unconditional love to him . Otherwise , bad moods will become " contagious " in your home and you will keep passing the negative energy back and forth . <p> For more of Dr. Bermans unconventional relationship advice or information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : drlauraberman.com.

@@79605127 @1105127/ <p> You have probably heard from relationship experts , me included , that its only a Hollywood fantasy to think your partner will " complete you . " For most people , relationships are very important , but its a very wrong expectation to think that Prince ( Princess ) Charming will come into your life and make everything right . <p> Yet , there is more and more research about relationships that indicate its essential there be a good attachment between one another if your partnership is to be strong . Clearly , this can be very confusingattachment is good but wanting to have your partner make you whole is bad ? Yes ! <p> A Bit Of History <p> Years ago Mary D. Salter Ainsworth , an American developmental psychologist known for her work in early emotional attachment , conducted a study entitled , " The Strange Situation . " Children between the ages of 12 and18 months were put in a room with their mothers and a stranger . The toddlers were observed to see their reactions when Mom was asked to leave . At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his or her Mother , they only want Mamano one else will substitute . In other words , they cry when Mama leaves the room and are only comforted upon her return . ( Note that at this time in history , Mom was the one who traditionally took care of the child . ) <p> A more prominent finding in the study says that the kind of attachment the child has early in life proves to indicate what their style of attachment will be in their adult relationships ! <p> Some Newer Thoughts For Me <p> I am well aware of Ainsworths study and the correlation between early and later year attachments because I teach it in my undergraduate Psychology course . However , this past summer , I learned something very interesting at a SmartMarriages conference . Dr. Sue Johnson , a renowned relationship expert from Canada , gave a keynote address . In her talk , she emphasized the point that no matter what a couple is arguing about , the underlying issue is always about attachment . Since I spend a great deal of time teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly gave me a reason to pause and think . <p> Upon getting back to my practice , I started to listen to my couples with a " different ear , " so to speak , and offer them a model that was aligned with Johnsons thinking . In fact , it did resonate with them ! <p> Let me clarify for you more specifically what attachment is . Regardless of gender or age , its a basic need that everyone has . And its quite a powerful one : Its the need to feel that you matter ; that your needs are important ; that you are secure with your significant other ; that your loved one feels that you value him or her and that you see him or her as adequate . When you do not experience these feelings , it is replaced with a sense of being disconnected . Does this ring true for you as well ? <p> But here 's the emotional paradox : As much as you want to be connected to your partner , exposing your needs is risky . Humans are emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerableto protect yourself you act clingy , withdrawn or lash out at your mate . In reality , each partner has the same fears of not being wanted , of being abandoned or of not being loved any more . <p> However , if you realize what 's really going on , things can be different . Start to take a chance and be open about your experiences . When you do , a whole new type of relationship can start to evolve . Rather than blaming the other person , think about what 's going on with you . Rather than withdrawing , try sharing your feelings . The strange part of it is that each of you is probably going through the same thing in a slightly different way . Approach it more honesty and a whole new world becomes available . <p> When you truly embrace this concept , you have not placed the burden of responsibility for completing you onto your partner . To do so is really too much of a burden .

" <p> Studies in neuroscience have led to some interesting discoveries in human behavior . Essentially , it has been discovered that novelty is a key driver of happiness and that this creates new , neural pathways , which deepen our levels of satisfaction . I immediately thought about the implications of this discovery for a long-term relationship like marriage . <p> If novelty makes us happy , then how can we remain happy in a relationship where the effects of time will automatically impact the novelty factor ? Does this mean that we are pressured to trick our brains by re-creating novelty in marriage or does marriage demand a different pathway for satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness or fulfillment ? <p> Obviously , this is no black and white issue with trite , clear-cut answers . It , however , provides fresh impetus for us to re-examine the state of our relationships . <p> Core Commitment <p> Taking a fresh look at our relationship can begin with clarifying our definition of what marriage means . This involves examining our own expectations about what will make or break the relationship and includes setting clear parameters and guidelines for issues like communication , couple-time , dishonesty , infidelity , abuse , neglect and other things , which can threaten the life of a marriage . <p> Discussing these issues up front , long before they even pose a threat , is a great way for a couple to become familiar with each others breaking points or tolerance levels . When the basis for our core commitment is settled , then working to improve what we already have is a bonus , which is not motivated by a fear that we might lose our spouse if we do n't  keep the tricks coming . Before we become obsessed about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment is tried , tested and true . <p> Something New <p> None of us can deny the rush of excitement , which we experience when we embark on something new .

When we think of marriage , attempting to create this " high " is a vital and often necessary component in keeping our marriages alive and interesting . It is critical , however , that we temper this with a dose of reality . <p> Novelty is great and I 'm not knocking it by any means , but we should see it as an " icing on the cake " scenario instead of the whole cake . Novelty is a great addition ; almost a luxury that keeps things fresh , but it should not form the core of commitment . In other words , our marriage should not be based on whether or not there is enough novelty to keep it going . At the same time , novelty introduces added value to a marriage that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Added Value <p> Adding value through novelty simply means kicking our relationship into high gear , with thoughtful experimentation and spontaneity . Finding out what our spouses preferences are in the bedroom and catering to those , is a great way to demonstrate that we are placing our spouses needs first . Admittedly , maintaining a surprise element in the sex department is no mean feat . It is , however , unique to each couple and how this plays out will be contingent on things like sexual experience , personality preferences , a willingness to experiment and knowledge about sex . <p> Novelty , however , need not apply purely to sex . It also means working to preserve a sense of freshness by trying new things together . This can includes traveling , or staying overnight in hotels , pursuing ballroom or Latin dance as a couple , doing a class or hobby together , or even volunteering with a church-group or charitable organization . Sharing new activities can bring a sense of personal satisfaction while also confirming our shared values . This can cause a couple to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb or a fresh frontier to conquertogether . <p> Even pursuing new interests on our own can add new dimensions to our character , which in turn does add value to our marriage . Living out those things we feel passionate about ensures that we are not overtly dependent on our partner for happiness or self-worth . Our sense of success or accomplishment can be infectious , causing our spouse to see us in a whole new light . This is sure to kick the sense of boredom or staleness out of our relationship as we work together to make our individual and couple-lives more meaningful .

You turn on the television these days and all you see on every channel is some teenager getting knocked up by super sperm . It 's depressing because for many of us , getting pregnant is not so easy . Weve heard from literally hundreds of couples who are stressed out because the quality of their sex lives has suffered due to the pressure to conceive . We thought a few out-of-the-box suggestions might ease your tension and hopefully help make conception a little bit easier and more fun . <p> Reduce Your Stress Level Stress is a major factor in how our bodies work or do n't  work as the case may be . Lowering your stress level is easier said than done , but here are a few new ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to make a baby . That means take a few nights off and focus on building some anticipation for each other .

What better way for that to happen naturally than to have a magical evening instead of another less than romantic " got to do it now because she 's ovulating " screw . <p> Remember too that stress causes our bodies to produce the hormone cortisol . Not only does cortisol make us fat , it also attaches to our testosterone and carries it out of the body unused . What that means is that when you 're stressed , you do n't  feel sexy or sexual . It is our belief that cortisol also makes the body inhospitable to conception . Why ? Well , if you are not in the mood because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not flowing to your genitals and your vaginal juices are not flowing either .

As most of you may already know from our previous articles , when women and men climax , we release a burst of the hormone oxytocin . For women , we also release a burst of estrogen , which is vitally important for conception . It is our contention that , in a post orgasmic state , a womans body is much more receptive to conception because the pH levels in her vagina should be a little more basic than usual , due to the abundance of vaginal secretions brought on by adequate arousal . The lubrication loosens the mucus in the vagina and allows his swimming sperm a better chance to find the egg !

This is going to sound like an old wives tale , but we have seen it work again and again . Try taking the cough medicine Robitussin DM every night to lower your mucus levels ( Chris Rock will be so happy ) . This is especially important for any women who have used a progestin-based form of birth control in the past , including certain birth control pills , implants or the patch .

Every chiropractor you meet will regale you with tales of numerous patients who came to them after being diagnosed as infertile , only to conceive under their care . The belief is that when you have a very tipped uterus , conception can be very difficult and chiropractic adjustments may release the tension in the lower back and allow the uterus to shift into a more amenable position allowing for conception to take place .

TRINA READ <p> BigStockPhoto Would you like the initiating of sex to be more 50/50 in your relationship ? <p> Who initiates sex in your relationship ? Couples surveyed said ideally they would like both partners to initiate equally . Yet people tend to attract their polar opposite . As a result one person will be more assertive and tend to do the bulk of bedroom initiation . Couples settle in and unwittingly form an " Initiator " / " Pursued " bonding-pattern . <p> Most destructive though is when the Initiator has had enough and starts to nag . It creates a toxic power struggle , with both people drudging up hurt feelings and putting up walls . Sex comes to a screeching halt with both not knowing how to climb out of the non-initiating hole . <p> Sex Matters for Women by Sallie Foley writes , " But because sex is such a loaded issue in our society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they desire it and thoroughly enjoy it the burden of feeling awkward or ashamed of wanting it too much inhibits them . If a woman or man feels sexually insecure , initiating sex can be intimidating . The ever-present possibility of being turned down or ridiculed makes the overture too scary . " <p> Being taken out of your natural " Pursued " role and becoming an equal opportunity " Initiator " is understandably uncomfortable . So where do you start ? <p> First , get the facts . Figure out how many times and/ or the percentage you initiate ( i.e. 0% , 10% , 25% ) per month . Make a commitment to take the number or percentage up over the next six months . If you initiate once every couple of months , make a pact to initiate once a month . Believe it or not , having a specific number will help steel your resolve to accomplish your goal . <p> Then become acutely aware of any negative communication loops you and your spouse may have built up around the topic of initiation . Mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , destructive loop and immediately disengage from your communication patterns . Only when you have cooled down , identify how both of you act and react to this anxiety . <p> Next set your boundaries if your partner overtly or covertly bugs you about not initiatingsarcastic jabs , sighs , slamming of doors . When you see this behavior , wait until they calm down before telling them you are doing your best to create a new dynamic and to back off . Explain that a big part of the problem is their constant negative enforcement which is most likely paralyzing your ability to initiate . If they do not believe you , show them this article . <p> Now its time to take action . Start small to build up your confidence . Give them a lingering kiss when they do n't  expect it .

This is simply the awkward part of transforming new habits . <p> Once you become more confident with the baby steps , it is time for full-on initiating sex . This demands some planning on your part .

Unless you 're among those fortunate few untouched by current economic conditions , you should be taking action to protect your assets . Let me offer three suggestions to assist you . <p> 1 . Protect your home . Those of you with homes purchased between 2002 and 2006 are at the greatest risk . Values began rising dramatically following the 9/11 terrorist attack , as a combination of low down payments and unrealistic loan standards , which induced many families to lever their way into unaffordable homes .

The first thing to do is approach your lender and request a loan modification so the terms are something you can live with . Responsible lenders will prefer to change the terms of a loan rather than commence foreclosure action that may result in acquiring an unwanted property . As for approach , contacting your lender personally will be far better than hiring one of these " loan modification specialists " now crawling out from under the rocks .

Pierpont Morgan responding to an inquiry as to what the market will do , " It will fluctuate ! " This is why you and your spouse must take charge ; investment decisions can not be left to your broker or your financial advisor . <p> Become familiar with the investment world . Subscribing to the Wall Street Journal and Barrons Weekly is a good start . Participate in and conduct your own research in every decision involving your holdings . Never authorize a brokerage establishment or individual stockbroker to maintain a discretionary account . Avoid involvement with anyone soliciting your business through telephone or mail . Lastly , steer clear of the manipulated markets : annuities , foreign-currency trading , options , precious metals , penny stocks , and the like . <p> 3 . Protect your stash of cash .

Just make sure to get your supplies in order beforehand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experts , cleaning almost always takes longer than you 'd expect . <p> 1 . Start with a plan . " Have a strategy for who is responsible for each task , zone or room that needs to be cleaned or organized , " says Dana Korey , professional organizer and founder of Away With Clutter Inc. ( awaywithclutter.com ) . <p> 2 . Put on a show .

It sounds sort of silly , but thisll give your kids some good motivation , and you can play director , reminding the kids what needs to be done . And if you want play the role of Coppola and stay behind the camera , all the better . <p> 3 . Use squirt guns , not spray bottles .

" Let kids squirt windows and mirrors and wipe dry with paper towels . " She swears it wont streak . <p> Five bucks says your husband ca n't resist shooting the gun either or pulling up his shirt sleeve to make a " guns " reference . <p> 4 . Give kids their own cleaning tools . " Do n't  expect kids to use adult tools to clean . Instead , create supplies that are kid-friendly , " says Amy Olson of The Maids Home Services ( maids.com ) . " Use an ice-cream pail for mopping chores or shorten an old mop handle or broom to make it kid-sized . " <p> Hilton also offers suggestions for kid-specific tools . " Put together a kid-size tote , " she says . " Check the home organizing aisle for smaller-than-usual totes . Often a makeup tote or tackle box will be the perfect size .

" Tell your spouse that you ca n't do this project without him or her and that it 's something you know he or she can do better than you canand it will look fantastic when completed ! " <p> 9 . Use money as an incentive . According to Coinstar ( coinstar.com ) representative Martin Pearce , families typically have about $99 in coins lying around their house .

If its your spouse , not your kids , who need some extra motivation to clean , promise them a little extra something for when the chores are all done , the kids are tired out and you can spend some time alone . It may feel manipulative , but it may also be the ticket to getting the house spic and span .

Make sure you have the right relationship tools for the job.BY SHARON RIVKIN , M.A. , M.F.T. <p> DepositPhoto Before your begin ripping down walls in your home , make sure the walls to your communication are already down . <p> " Combining maturity with good communication and awarenessa successful compromise is the rule , rather than the exception . " <p> Spring is almost here , and its time to start thinking about spring cleaning , yard maintenance , and home improvements . But before you start a home improvement , is your marriage strong enough for the undertaking ? <p> Be forewarned that your marriage will go through many tests and hurdles while you 're pounding nails and arguing with contractors . Why ? Because home improvement challenges the foundation of your marriage and the success of which is based on maturity , good communication , and compromise . <p> 1 . What is your maturity level ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s stubborn , or if you keep the peace and he always gets his way , compromise will never happenthere will only be a winner and a loser . The more mature a person is , the more able they are to " get out of themselves " and effectively communicate with their partner , which means really listening to and respecting their spouses view . This , in turn , enables the couple to negotiate and compromise . If your marriage is rated low on the maturity level , get to work immediately on changing destructive patterns and making behavioral changes that will strengthen your relationship , which will lead to better communication and , ultimately , to successful compromise ; thus making for a happier , long-term partnership . <p> 2 . How are your communication skills ? If your verbal exchanges with your spouse seem to consistently end up in feelings of frustration , not being heard , or heated arguments , heed these warning signs that something is definitely awry in your marriage . Lack of communication is the leading cause of marital breakdown , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help to improve how you talk and listen to your partner , before you start to improve your home ! Why ? Because home projects require constant communication between you and your spouse , you and your workers , and you and your contractor . If you cant communicate effectively , problems will inevitably occur , tasks improperly executed and completed , and unresolved fighting and unfair concessions . Good communication takes practice , practice , practice and includes speaking clearly and succinctly , listening , using " I " statements , having patience , and , more importantly , the safety to state your opinion without blame or shame or the need to be right . In short , each party feels heard and understood . <p> 3 . Why is it so hard to compromise ? Its rare that we all feel exactly the same way about the same thing , so the art of compromise includes being aware of what 's truly important to you and your partner , and honoring his/her ideas , beliefs , and passions . Combining maturity with good communication and awareness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception . For instance , you 're replacing your dilapidated deck , and you and your husband are disputing over whether to use wood ( your preference ) or a composite ( your husbands choice ) . With careful analysis , you 've determined that your husband adores being on the deck , mowing the grass that surrounds the deck , barbecuing , and sinking into his favorite outdoor chair . <p> You , on the other hand , enjoy being outside , but your passion is n't barbecuing or cutting the grass . Yours is more art-based , with an eye for color that draws your passion to the outdoor colors of the flowers and foliage . So , with that awareness , you 're able to see that the deck is more important to your husband and thus the beginning of compromise . Because compromise is a settlement of a dispute that is reached by each side making concessions , how would you compromise ? " Honey , I understand how important the deck is to you , and while I 'm willing to let you choose the material ( your concession ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color ( his concession ) . " <p> Equally important is the ability to compromise over issues with opposing ideas . Let 's say the deck is installed and you insist on a railing , but your husband thinks it will impede his view . Though code does n't  require a railing due to the low height of the deck , you , however , are adamant that a railing be installed because of aesthetics . Remember , compromise happens when each party makes concessions . Because your passion is art and color , you feel strongly that the installation of a beautiful rail will complete the appearance . How do you compromise when your ideas are opposite ? " I know that a rail is important to you ( his concession ) , but could we compromise on the height so I have a better view of the yard ( your concession ) ? " <p> If you want to up the ante for a successful home project , check your maturity level and start working on your marriage . Then , sharpen your communication skills and become aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he/she is . This winning formula takes work , but when each husband and wife feels heard and understood , they 're willing to compromiseand the payoff is a healthier and happy marriage . 113804 @qwx733804

Yet marriage also has essential periods that are much like autumn and winter ; these are the times when things seem mundane , quiet , or lacking in fire . It is important to remember that these periods are often necessary to allow reflection and appreciation of the more intense and fiery seasons of life .

Marriage allows this same freedom and creativity . If seeds are sown haphazardly and wild nature takes its own course in the garden space of marriage , less than optimal conditions result . Carefully selected seeds , planted in the proper space at the right time , create a magical garden without intense , overwhelming effort . While this type of careful selection takes planning , forethought , and effort , the payoff is amazingly substantial . Its never too early or too late to evaluate the seeds youd like to select and then sow in your marriage .

With loving , creative energy , you can cultivate the marriage of your dreams . <p> Make Time for Weeding : Even the most perfect garden requires weeding now and again . Those pesky weeds can sneak up out of nowhere and choke out the desirable seedlings . Each marriage has its own type of weeds that can be a threat to the relationship . What works well in your best friends marriage may end up being a troublesome nuisance in your relationship . Pay attention to the little irksome things that tend to crop up over time .

Notice these weeds as they arise and make time to talk about these issues in an open and caring way . Its easier for partners to listento really hear concernswhen the focus is on the health of the relationship rather than on what your partner is doing wrong .

Gardens survive through periods of drought and heavy storms . Although it is natural to prefer temperate weather , changes and challenges are unavoidable . Its easy to get stuck in patterns of worrying , being angry , or avoiding impending problems , yet these behaviors do not help us prepare for difficult times . When storms and droughts are on the horizon , it is essential to have an attentive and proactive attitude . A stormy onslaught of bad news and worries can leave the most stable of marriages on somewhat shaky ground . Periods of drought can sweep in and leave a once-vibrant marriage feeling dry and lifeless . Become proactive by learning to attend to the patterns in your marriage . If bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , or work is going awry , beware that a thunderstorm might be in the making . Take preventive steps to work with your sweetheart to notice the difficulties and take measuresone by oneto head off the storms . Carve out a Sunday afternoon to troubleshoot and make a plan . It can be amazing to watch worries subside when you , as a cohesive couple , tackle the troubles as a united front . The same theory holds if you sense a drought is in store . Sit down with your spouse to talk about the parts of your marriage that feel dry and desert-like . Without blaming , brainstorm to find ways to rejuvenate and enliven your relationship . Although we cant control the challenging storms and periods of drought , the difficult times are more manageable when faced with loving , proactive awareness ! <p> Attend to Pesky Insects : Habits are similar to garden insects . Most habits , like insects , are not inherently " bad ; " it is the unwanted effects that are troublesome ! This is a perfect time of year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are there small changes you can make to tidy up your part of the relationship ? Take a few minutes to think of the little gripes your sweetheart has made over the last year . Are there some pesky habits that you can let go of for the sake of a happier marriage ? Its often easier to make slight changes when you realize that irksome habits have a way of becoming giant pests in the minds of loved ones . The overall health of your marriage is so much more important than habits , such as leaving the toilet seat up or being " right " in each disagreement . Strive to adopt an attitude that allows the more harmless bugs to remain while the damaging pests are shooed away with patience and conscientiousness . <p> Essential Sunshine : We all know that sunshine is essential to plant and animal life . Its interesting to consider that sunshine is also vital to the health of your marriage . Quite literally , sunshine can do wonders for relationships ! First of all , exposure to sunshine increases the brains production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of happiness and well-being . Depression and many symptoms associated with depression are often thought to be connected to low levels of serotonin . Appetite and wakefulness are also affected by serotonin . Exposure to sunshine also helps regulate human circadian rhythms ( the sleep-wake cycle ) and fosters the bodys synthesis of Vitamin D. What marriage would n't benefit from greater feelings of happiness , well-being , better health , and improved sleep cycles ? So , take your sweetie by the hand and sit in the sun on a weekend afternoon . Try a sunlit walk in the park or take a hike on the hillsides . Enjoy Sunday morning coffee on the front porch . Meet for an impromptu , sun-infused lunch in the midst of a busy week . Leave behind distractions , such as cell phones and other electronics to take full advantage of the healing , rejuvenating effects of the suns rays . Note : Sunscreen and hats are recommended ! <p> Perfectly Imperfect : Nature is perfectly , gorgeously imperfect . A visit to the local farmers market or your own backyard garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vegetables often have tiny markings , scars , and discolorations . These small , natural blemishes are a testament to natures power and beauty . Humans , too , are wonderfully and distinctively imperfect . As relationships endure and weather rigorous periods , scars and blemishes result . It is these imperfections that make every couple a unique , inimitable pair . Resist the urge to compare your garden to the seeming perfection of the neighbors next door . When you look into the eyes of your partner , you both know that you share secrets , stories , and wonders that are yours and yours alone . Your perfectly imperfect marriage deserves your continued loving cultivation . After all , it is yours . <p> Learn to enjoy every aspect of your gardening journeythat 's the secret !

@@79605150 @1105150/ <p> Masturbation InfidelityIs self-pleasuring considered cheating if you keep it a secret ? BY DR . TRINA READ <p> BigStockPhoto Masturbating is usually a very intimate experience , but letting your partner in can make it better . <p> A while back , I met with a couple that was in a pretty bad sexual rut . Theyd been married for fifteen years and had two teenage kids . I met with them separately to take a sex history . It turns out both were masturbating almost daily , at about the same time in the evening , without their partner knowing what the other was doing . To top it off , neither wanted their partner to know what they were up to , as they were too ashamed of their behavior . <p> My bias is not to keep secrets in a relationship . I told them the gig was up . Their next step was to tell each other what had been transpiring for over three years . I also requested that they refrain from contacting me until they had . <p> Three months later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time the subject was brought up , it was immediately dropped . During the second week , every time one brought up the topic , they would end up in a huge fight . Finally after three months of fighting and with much reluctance they shared . <p> Did the sharing help ? Certainly much of their sexual angst was the inability to communicate preferences and needs . Their admission opened an untapped avenue in their 15-year relationship . From that point , they were able to reach a new level of intimacy . <p> I still have yet to figure out why many couples feel masturbation is a taboo topic . Couples who decide to be in an exclusive , long-term relationship open up and share their finances , childhood hurts , future dreams but not their solitary self-pleasuring . Its almost as if many couples hit an intimacy and vulnerability wall . <p> In my opinion , as long as masturbation is not divisive in the relationship , there is no need to discourage it . Couples need to handle all of their sexual outlets objectively and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear two main themes about why masturbation in a couples situation is so secret . First , some people feel masturbation is an infidelity . Real sex is equated to a couples sex and precludes the need for one partner to go off and self-pleasure . <p> In essence , its seen as a slap in the face to the other partner . For example , a wife walks in on her husband having a " moment " in the shower . She may have feelings of , " what is wrong with me " , or " do n't  I satisfy you ? " As well , a fellows manhood may come into question when he feels his partner can not get all their needs met with him . <p> The second most frequent thing I hear , is masturbation is a private matter . Absolutely . However , there 's a difference between privacy and having a secret masturbation life . Many people do not communicate this private life in order to save their partners feelings . Or they simply do not know how to bring the topic up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex therapy books like Lonnie Barbachs For Each Other and Bernie Zilbergelds The New Male Sexuality , it shows the therapeutic benefits of sharing such information . Both authors advocate the individual is the only one who knows what feels best to them . Because these individuals may feel awkward in expressing their sexual needs , they leave it up to their partner to figure out how to best do it . This is an unfair predicament to place on the partner . In effect it is saying , " I want you to give me the most satisfaction possible , but I am not going to tell you how to do it . " <p> When the individual shares how they most like to be pleasured , its a goldmine of information for their partner . As well , it can guarantee pleasure from the majority of their sexual encounters . <p> Barbachs book highlights a survey done by Philip and Lorna Sarrel , sex therapists at Yale University . They concluded , " Among women who have told their partners exactly how they like to be touched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or almost every time they made love . The good communicators had intercourse more often and were likelier to be satisfied with its frequency . " <p> Trust me , this is one of those exercises that is intellectually easy ; actually doing it is a completely different kettle of fish . Just like the above couple , a few fights might ensue . The reason is society has scripted incredibly negative messages since childhood on how touching ourselves is wrong , bad or immoral . <p> Yet , when you open yourself up to your partner and become more vulnerable , it can open a whole new level of sensuality . 113806 @qwx733806 
@@79605152 @1105152/ <p> Top 10 Issues that Can Make or Break Your Holiday SeasonGet started early and make your holiday season a smooth one with these great tips.BY SHARON RIVKIN , M.A. , M.F.T. <p> DepositPhotos Wear a smile this holiday season by ditching what has n't worked in the past . <p> " Take what has n't  worked in the past and use it to create a better situation for this season . " <p> The holidays are here once again , as well as the anticipation , excitement , and sometimes dread . Its wise to plan ahead , not just for the menu or the presents or the guests , but more importantly , for you . How can you make this a truly happy , healthy , fun holiday season for you , your spouse , and your family ? Here are the top 10 issues that usually make or break the holiday season : <p> 1 . Traditions . Even traditions that we once loved can become old habits that just do n't  work anymore ; so review your traditions . Does the family look forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that just because you 've been doing them forever that they 're still working . If they are , great , if not , change them ! <p> 2 . Cooking and Preparing . If you feel you 're the one stuck doing all the planning , cooking , and cleaning , speak up if you 're unhappy with your role . Do n't  expect your spouse or family to read your mind , and do n't  carry the resentment into the holiday season . There 's really no reason to be a holiday martyr . <p> 3 . Presents and Finances . Discuss the holiday budget with your spouse ahead of time and stick to it . If there 's a conflict about the amount of the budget , figure out a compromise . It needs to be a win/win situation . Check in with each other halfway into the holidays and see where you 're at to see if the budget needs amending . If you 're off track , look at the numbers again and redo a more realistic budget . If you 're right where you should be , keep doing what you 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holiday stressors from past seasons and do something different this year . Make a point of relieving the stress with a massage , a movie , an evening without phone calls or commitments , etc . Listen to each other and hear each other out . No problem is too small or too big to address . <p> 5 . Juggling . There are a lot of events and parties that you may want to attend this holiday season , but you probably cant do them all ! Discuss and coordinate your schedules ahead of time and decide what your priorities are . Then , before you RSVP , check again with your spouse to avoid misunderstandings and double scheduling . <p> 6 . Families . Most of us have difficult family members and we can usually predict that theyll be a problem during the holidays . Rather than shudder with dread at the very thought of seeing them ( and instead of complaining about the situation ) make a plan of action . Maybe you can talk to the family member ahead of time and declare a truce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance to put into action if it gets tense at the holiday dinner table . The main point ? Take what has n't  worked in the past and use it to create a better situation for this season . <p> 7 . In-Laws . How do you decide whose in-laws to spend the holidays with ? How is the time divided up if you 're going to different houses ? How do you compromise ? Take turns on a yearly basis . It needs to be fair with equal time spent because everyone is counting ! If the in-laws complain about the arrangement , the spouse of that particular in-law could call in advance to explain honestly how you came up with the decision : " We decided to make sure it was fair by seeing Stans family this year , since we did n't  see them last year . So , let 's talk about how we can still make this holiday fun and enjoyable for everyone . " <p> 8 . Kids . Blended family issues can be a huge problem during the holidays . Between custody arrangements , problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in the family , the holidays can be a nightmare . Put everything out on the table , including past and present issues , and brainstorm about doing it differently this year . Whatever you 've done in the past that did n't  work , do n't  do it again . <p> 9 . Conflict . There are so many potential disagreements that can happen during the holidays , so its essential to start learning and developing good conflict resolution skills . There are excellent sources , but for starters : listen , do n't  blame and shame , do n't  name call , take time outs when necessary , stop having the need to be right , and remember that compromise is essential . By exercising fair fighting rules , each partner will learn valuable skills for the future , and feel heard , understood , and connected for the holiday season . <p> 10 . Being a Scrooge . If she loves to decorate for Christmas and he wants nothing to do with it , talk about why he/shes acting like a scrooge ! There 's a good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both partners . After uncovering the reason , scrooge may be able to take a baby step to begin enjoying the holidays , which may lead to a bigger step next year . Keep expectations reasonable to avoid major disappointments . <p> The holidays are an excellent opportunity to strengthen your marriage and communicate differently . Change it up this year and revamp the holidays by addressing the issues that have been continuously avoided . Talk about problems with your partner and really listen to each other . Communication can go a long way in making this a joyous seasonone that you 'll be grateful for ! <p> " What 's the big deal ? All I said was . . . " Sound familiar ?

Here are 11 insights to help you fight seasonal dread and have a holly-jolly holiday instead.BY SUSAN APOLLON <p> DepositPhoto Remember to take care of yourself to have the power to be there for everyone else . <p> " When you choose to simply let it go , you give yourself permission to heal and you release the ghost that was holding you captive . " <p> If you 're like many people , you 're dealing with a snowstorm of not-so-joyful feelings during the holiday season . First , you have the stress of buying a vast array of gifts and juggling an over-packed schedule . You have obligatory family visits , which may carry their own emotional baggage . And if someone you love has recently passed away , you may find yourself trying to " celebrate " through a miasma of sadness . <p> Most of us have mixed feelings about the winter holidays . On one hand , we look forward to the festive atmosphere and spiritual rituals . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention the unresolved grief that manifests this time of yearand running through it all is the sense that the holidays should look and feel a certain way . <p> The holidays really can be , if not greeting card perfect , then at least , rich and rewarding in their own very real way . But first , you 've got to learn to manage your expectations and live each moment to the fullest . Read these 11 tips on how to defuse your seasonal dread and infuse your holidays with joy and peace . <p> 1 . Love and forgive yourself unconditionally . This may seem like an odd way to begin , but self-love and forgivenesswhich may be thought of as two sides of the same coinare at the heart of everything . Before you can make peace with , say , the emotionally abusive mother you dread seeing at your Hanukkah get-together , you must first make peace with yourself . The adage is true : If you want to love others unconditionally , you have to first love yourself . Loving yourself is really the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the holidays . <p> People tend to be very hard on themselves . We must all learn to accept the fact that right now we are exactly where we are supposed to be on our spiritual journey . That does n't  mean you should stop striving to improve the aspects you know need work . It does mean realizing you are human . Allow yourself time to relax , to rest , and even to cry if you need to . By simply allowing yourself to feel the way you feel , the emotional load on your back will lighten . <p> Of course , its easy to say those two little words , " forgive yourself , " but most of us do n't  really know how to do it . <p> 2 . Choose to forgive others . If you are holding a grudge against the cousin who excluded you from her wedding invitation list , you will dread seeing her at the big Christmas dinner . The bad feelings that arise whenever you think of this slight are a sign that you need to forgive her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you and will make the event far more pleasant . Remember , you 're not doing it for heryoure doing it for you . <p> Forgiveness is a function of love . It is vitally important that you learn to forgive the people who have wronged you . Remember that everyone on earth is walking their own path and is trying to do the best they can . The strongest choice you could possibly make is to let go of any unresolved anger and choose to forgive them . It is not easy , but it is deeply rewarding . The choices you make have different energetic vibrations , and forgiveness and love carry with them the highest resonance . When you do n't  forgive , you deny yourself a higher energetic payoff . <p> " Forgiveness is a function of love . " <p> However , what if there 's someone in your life you are simply not ready to forgive ? That 's okay . Just accept that there is a price to be paid in terms of your own peace of mind . Its okay to avoid holiday events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But because life is about constant growth , know that one day you may be better equipped to let go of old grievances . Until then , continue to love yourself unconditionally and treat yourself well . <p> 3 . Know what you can and can not control . Learning that you can control only your own actions and feelings is vital to becoming a happier person . Many people can not forgive others and move away from past pain because they do n't  understand this fact . <p> Control struggles are huge emotion and energy drainers . The moment you understand that you can manage only your own feelings and thoughts , you will find power you did n't  know you had . When you continue to hold someone accountable for a past grievance , you allow her to hurt you all over again . However , when you choose to simply let it go , you give yourself permission to heal and you release the ghost that was holding you captive . <p> Another way to look at an old grudge is to remind yourself that everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the circumstances . Perhaps your parents did n't  always make great choices when they raised you , but they did the best job they could at the moment . Remind yourself of this fact when you see your grumpy Aunt Eunice eye you critically as you help yourself to seconds at dinner . Focus on old memories that you shared with Aunt Eunice before a rift grew between you . You will find love in those memories and they will give the two of you common ground . By choosing to love Aunt Eunice or anyone else who once made your blood boil , you are actually empowering yourself and saving valuable emotional energy ! <p> 4 . When grief rears up , learn to " Face , Embrace , and Replace It . " If you 're dealing with grief at the holidaysperhaps due to a death in the family , an estrangement from someone you love , or a divorcedont try to deny your pain . Rather , make a conscious effort to work through it . My mantra on dealing with grief is " face it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , the only way to " get over " sadness is to experience it . Grief can take on many forms , especially around this time of year . <p> If you need to cry , cry , even if you 're at a party and have to leave the room . You might even set aside an evening to get in touch with your grief . Fix the cocoa you used to drink with your mother or go through your photo albums . Its healthier to feel the sadness and loss than to detach yourself from it . Its right and normal to grieve ; just do n't  make it the dominant part of who you are . <p> 5 . Do n't  over-commit to the holidays . Most people vow that this year they wo n't stretch themselves too thin ( physically , emotionally , and financially ) , but somehow they spend the holidays exhausted , frazzled , and broke . It is hard to feel joyful and loving when you are exhausted from too many parties and you 're out of cash . It really is okay to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel guilty about skipping out on your in-laws personal-drama-filled party in favor of a quiet evening baking cookies and wrapping presents with your kids . Its your life , and you get to live it your way . <p> Also , do n't  overspend . The true meaning of the season has nothing to do with presents and price tags . You can still give thoughtful gifts to your family and friends without racking up a huge , stressful credit card bill . A batch of homemade salsa or even a heartfelt letter can be more appreciated than a $100 blouse , and it also helps you feel responsible , calm , and in control of your finances . <p> 6 . Get in the joy zone . In order to be ready for the impending holiday cheer , you may need a little inspiration . Not everyone starts off the season in a joyful mood . Some people need a little boost to get there . You can rev up your level of good cheer by doing something that makes you feel great . <p> Indulge in a sinful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel pampered . Listen to your favorite holiday album , sip eggnog , or attend temple to get in a seasonal mood . Remember that peace and joy are contagious , so if you put it out there , chances are very good that you will get it back ! Also , keep in mind that others are watching you and will see how empowered you become just by being happy . <p> You can also seek happiness by committing random acts of kindness . It can be something as small as saying , " Have a blessed day " to a stranger or donating money to a charity . The act does not matter ; its the love behind the act that counts . <p> 7 . Do a practice run before the dreaded event . Before going to a holiday function , you can actually rehearse the event to help you get in a positive frame of mind . Chances are that at any holiday get-together , there will be at least one person you do n't  really want to see . Think of this person and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if need be ) . You can visualize yourself approaching this person and speaking with love and kindness . When you fill yourself with love , you will be able to enter the party with the proper frame of mindand you may find that being kind and spreading holiday cheer is a little easier than you had expected ! <p> " If you exude bitterness , anger , or self-pity , then you cant really expect others around you to feed you good cheer by the spoonful . " <p> 8 . Stay in the moment . Think about the vast amount of time you spend dwelling on the past or worrying about the future . You may realize that you spend very little time actually existing in the present moment ! This is very unhealthy . In fact , it is the source of virtually all anxiety and depression . Your energy is far more powerful when it is there with you as much as possible . <p> At holiday parties and events , it is especially important to stay in the moment . Do n't  let your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are responsible for and are in control of your thoughts , and with a little effort and practice , you will find that its easy to be serene and even lighthearted in situations that may have once made you uncomfortable . <p> 9 . Use the Law of Attraction to create joyful experiences ( a.k.a. " acting as if " ) . Every morning when you wake up , the ball is in your court in regards to how you want to spend your day . If you exude bitterness , anger , or self-pity , then you cant really expect others around you to feed you good cheer by the spoonful . Remember the law of the universe : Like attracts like . This is a very valuable lesson that is easy to apply to the holidays . Even if you do n't  necessarily feel charitable or joyful , put a smile on your face and intend to feel better and you might surprise yourself by actually feeling better . ( Or as some self-help gurus like to say , " Fake it till you make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proverbial hatchet with family members or friends you know will be around during the holiday season , make a conscious choice to surround those people with love . By being the bigger person and greeting them with a heartfelt , " Happy Holidays ! " followed by , " I 'm so glad to see you ! " you can set the tone for the holidays , as well as change your energy and the energy of those around you . Do n't  wait for someone else to take the initiativesometimes you just have to take the lead . <p> 10 . Take care of yourself . Youll look and feel better . Make sure that you get enough sleep to survive all the events that will be coming your way this time of year . Eat well so your body will stay strong . Avoid the urge to overeat at partiesyou will just feel sluggish and cranky afterward . Spend some time each day alone and quiet to help regain your inner balance . Try to find time to exercise each day , even if it is just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , and a flattering new holiday outfit would n't hurt , either . <p> When you take the time to look your best , you will feel your best . That means allowing enough time before the party to apply your make-up , fix your hair , and find the perfect accessories for your new little black dress . As all women know , sometimes a new outfit or a new hairstyle is worth more than a month of therapy ! <p> " If you allow the season to be polluted with anxiety and sorrow , you are actively disconnecting from the exquisite peace the holidays offer . " <p> 11 . Manage your expectations . Remember that the holidays almost never turn out like a Norman Rockwell painting or a sepia-toned greeting card . It is important that you accept that the holidays probably wo n't go off without a hitch . Still , this time of the year can be pretty darn great if you seek out loving feelings toward your friends and families . Happiness can come only from embracing unconditional love as often as possible . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be delighted to find how much joy the holidays really can hold . <p> Around Christmas time and Hanukkah , it is important to remember that everyone is seeking peacethis quest is universal . If you allow the season to be polluted with anxiety and sorrow , you are actively disconnecting from the exquisite peace the holidays offer . Make a real effort this season to focus on loving feelings . Follow the love you feel . It will lead you away from painful memories and fears that cloud your day-to-day existence . Find the unconditional love that has survived in your heart , and you will be amazed at the new and joyful places it will lead you .

Focus on finding a solution . Guess what ? You 're not going to have that romantic relaxing " just us " weekend . Use your imagination and creativity . How can you turn what is now a family weekend into something fun and relaxing for your spouse ? Now that you 've engaged your sense of humor ( step 1 ) , you 'll have freed up your brain cells to think in a more positive and fulfilling direction . <p> 3 . Enjoy what is .

If you are going into marital counseling , you are attempting to save your marriage .

There are some therapists who believe that your individual personal happiness is more important than the end result of the union . <p> 3 . Does the person use an educationally , skills-based model ?

First of all , there are many types of infidelities , but it is important to know that not only can couples heal from them , but often their relationships become stronger .

Use these tips to choose a car that 's right for your family.BY SHERRICE GILSBACH <p> DepositPhotos Selecting the right family car takes a lot of research , but it can be very rewarding . <p> " One of the worst offenders for families when it comes to both comfort and convenience is a two-door vehicle . " <p> Whether you 're preparing for your first bundle of joy or your fifth , many changes come with each addition to the family . Modifying your mode of transportation may be on the top of the list . As you embark on your family car search , remember there 's more to a car than just the number of seats it contains . <p> We contacted dealer insider , editorial contributor and father of two , Ed Armbruster , for his suggestions on the family-car-shopping process . <p> " It just so happens that I 've recently made the switch to a family car , from a sport-utility , " Armbruster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep in mind what I needed out of my vehicle . Changing from a seven-passenger SUV or van to a sedan changes the game a bit . The fact that my wife still has a large SUV made the switch a little easier . This makes driving on field trips , or taking a carload of friends to the movies doable . " <p> We compared notes with Armbruster on what shoppers should consider first and came up with this list : <p> Budget <p> First things first : What can you afford ? Determine what your budget will comfortably allow , as far as a monthly payment or purchase price is concerned . Settling on an exact number will help you decide if you 're looking to buy a new car , lease a new car ( typically with a lower monthly payment than buying a car ) or purchasing a pre-owned vehicle . Keep in mind , if you 're going from a paid-off vehicle to a brand-new vehicle with monthly payments , your insurance costs will go up until the new car is paid in full . <p> Armbruster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With the economy the way it is , price was a concern . A new car was out of the question . Many of the cool European station wagons and sedans were too . The only way to keep the payment down on a fun Euro-cruiser was to buy something six- to seven-years-old , with a lot of miles . " <p> Making concessions is part of the car-shopping game for anyone who does n't  have access to an unlimited amount of cash . Do n't  waste time feeling bad about what you 're not getting . Instead , move on to the next step in the narrowing-down process and focus on what you can get . <p> Safety <p> Safety is a given when toting precious cargo . Due to safety regulations , all new cars come pretty well-equipped with standard safety features today , but there are still a few that outshine the rest of the pack . The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety publishes a list of all vehicles that achieved a " good " rating in all four of its test categories . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must-haves . Other features that increase safety include stability control , traction control , antilock brakes , increased use of high-strength steel in the vehicle frame , blind-spot notification systems , lane-departure warnings and adaptive cruise control . <p> Fuel Efficiency <p> Today , gas prices fluctuate more than your teenagers moods . If your commute is minimal , fuel economy may not be your top priority , but for the rest of us , those gallons can add up quickly . Thanks to new fuel-economy regulations and consumer demand , manufacturers are now more focused on developing efficient vehicles than ever before . In addition to new plug-in electric vehicles that do n't  use any gas at all and hybrids that combine gas-engine and battery power , there are also plenty of gas-powered cars out there achieving 40 mpg or more . <p> The Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency have also compiled a list stating the fuel efficiency of every 2012-model-year vehicle . <p> Comfort and Convenience <p> Comfort is subjective and depends on how much time you spend in the car and how particular you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something every person , especially a parent with a harried schedule and hands full of everything , can appreciate . <p> One of the worst offenders for families when it comes to both comfort and convenience is a two-door vehicle .

We do n't  recommend two-door cars for families with infantswait until all of the children in your crew are capable of operating the seatback , hopping into the backseat and buckling up completely on their own . <p> Armbruster sought interior and cargo space . " Interior room because families with small children have to use car seats . These require extra rear-seat legroom . This proved to be the hardest feature to find in a passenger car .

One-on-one feels like communication from a friend and loved one . Two-on-one feels like a firing squad . <p> * Stick to the facts : Only share with your spouse the actions and words that upset or hurt you . Let 's say he or she said something mean or unflattering about you at a party .

GOLD-BIKIN <p> BigStockPhoto Breaking up is hard to do . Do n't underestimate the emotional toll it will take . <p> When people think of divorce they never fully consider the emotions that will occur if they proceed . As children we hear fairytales , all of which end with , " And they lived happily ever after . " Of course , that is really the beginning of the story not the end . But the concept lives on in all of us as we contemplate what to expect from our very own marriages . <p> Unfortunately , marriage is not always perfect . It has its ups and downs . It is not always a 50/50 proposition . At times it may be more like a 90/10 proposition . Marriage and maintaining a relationship requires work every single day . The emotions incumbent during and after divorce must be balanced against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first emotion that people often feel when a marriage ends is a sense of failure , especially for women . After starting the marriage with such high hopes , when it does not work out there is a sense of having done something wrong which led to this result . It makes sense , therefore , to really explore all avenues of making the relationship work . This is provided , of course , that there is no abuse , cheating or alcoholism in the relationship . <p> Another emotion you may experience is loneliness . Most people , when they get out of their marriage , are by themselves or alone with their children . Since we live in a world of couples , many of your friends may no longer include you in their plans . You may feel guilty asking a friend to leave their spouse to spend time with you . Having been married for a while , you may not be used to doing things alone and , while this feeling will fade , there is the loss of having someone with whom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may no longer have time for a social life . In addition to being solely or primarily responsible for all of the childcare activities , dating with children is a problem , especially if babysitting is an issue .

This may create another trauma for the child while they are still trying to deal with the loss of the security of a " two parent family . " No matter how often you tell the children it is not their fault and they still have two parents , they will suffer . <p> Since there are so many things to think about before taking the first step toward divorce , considering the emotions of it is often put on the back burner . It should not be . Many people seek out therapy after divorce because frankly , the end of a marriage is like a death . And it should be recognized as such .

JONI FRATER AND ESTHER LASTIQUE <p> BigStockPhoto Breaking the ice may be difficult , but doing so will be better for your relationship now and down the road . <p> " Education is the key , and parents need to first educate themselves on the realities of todays complicated sexual landscape , so they can then adequately prepare their children with this information <p> For couples between the ages of mid-30s and late-50s with kids , chances are your children fall somewhere in or near their tumultuous teenage years . Along with the disrespectful back talk , breaking curfews , texting in a language that you do not understand , and possibly smoking and drinking , there is another 800-pound gorilla in the roomthe fact that your babies are becoming sexual beings . <p> The same way that many of you had no guide book on how to raise your kids this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to talk to your teenagers about sex . While we do n't  claim to be child-rearing experts , we are experts on talking to college-aged young adults about sex and sexuality . For those of you who do n't  know it , we travel the country visiting college campuses with a fun and sassy presentation called Sex Ed Boot Camp . <p> One of the scariest things we hear on every campus , regardless of which state we are in or the political climate , is that most students have never had a truly informative conversation about sex with the most important people in their livestheir parents . And here 's the kicker : they really do value what their parents think , and most of them wish they had more reliable information about sex . <p> Because this is such a taboo topic , we want to ease you into it . Times have changed since you entered adolescence . There are infinitely scarier ramifications of adolescent sexuality than an accidental pregnancy . As their parents , it is your responsibility to keep them out of harms way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educate themselves on the realities of todays complicated sexual landscape , so they can then adequately prepare their children with this information . <p> Let 's Talk About Sex Okay , so we have established that while you may not believe it , young adults really do want you to talk to them about sex . If you believe that talking about sexuality will encourage your kids to become sexual , just look at other cultures . Studies of other countries like Finland and Sweden where sexuality is taught starting in kindergarten in an upfront and age appropriate way shows that their young adults : <p> * Have a dramatically lower rate of teen pregnancy and STDs <p> * Wait about 1 year longer than their American counterparts to engage in sexual intercourse <p> * Have a much broader understanding about sexuality and how to enjoy it while staying healthy and safe . <p> The argument can also be made that in countries where sex education is a shared responsibility between parents and the school system , the result is lower divorce rates as these young adults mature and enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples in the U.S. that led us to work with college students . In our experience , a lack of basic sex education and communication are a direct cause of dissatisfaction in the bedroom once you 're married . ( This is especially true for couples who chose to remain abstinent prior to marriage . ) <p> From a sexology perspective , teenagers are going through the toughest times of their lives . Their hormonal development is pushing them with great urgency to be sexual , yet todays young adults are maturing sexually earlier than they are maturing emotionally . The physical urges are powerful and resistance is most often futileand telling them to " just say no " to sex is like telling them to " just say no " to drugs and alcohol . The more of a taboo you make it , the more they will want to experiment behind your back ( or right under your nose , or in your bed ) . <p> By being open and honest about sexuality as a normal and natural part of their development , you give your kids the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sexual to them . When your kids know that you are there for them no matter what , there is mutual trust and respect . Make it clear that when it comes to sex , things are no differentthat you are there for them to come to with concerns , questions and guidance without judgment . <p> Bad Information Let 's face it , our kids learn about sex in all the wrong places . From the locker room to the internet , teenagers are relying on misinformation and trial and error to navigate their sexual landscape . And if you think high school is going to do the job for you , think again . Under George W. Bush , all federally funded secondary schools must only teach " abstinence only until marriage " or risk losing their federal dollars . While the Obama administration has assisted in relaxing this dictum beginning in October 2010 for the sake of disease prevention , the damage for a generation of young adults has already been done . <p> The United States still has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 . Many of the Student Health Services providers we work with on campuses across the country say they have seen dramatic rises in STDs and unplanned pregnancies on campus since the change in education came into effect . In addition , since most college students combine alcohol or drugs with their sexual experimentation , you have the makings for a bad Lifetime movie . <p> We know there are a lot of you thinking that other adolescents are having sex but not yours . Here are some statistics that should you should consider : <p> According to the American College Health Association , most campuses report that more than 70 percent of college students are sexually active , having had more than one partner in the past year . <p> According to the CDC , 50 percent of todays young adults are destined to get an STD by the age of 25 , and 75 percent are destined to get an STD in their lifetime . <p> Several of these sexually transmitted diseases , particularly HPV , HIV , and Chlamydia , can have long-term health ramifications including infertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afflicted adults . Chlamydia has surpassed epidemic proportions , with seven new cases transmitted per minute ! This is in the U.S. alone . <p> Twenty six percent of all teenagers who take a vow of abstinence are pregnant in one year . This is a direct result of a lack of basic sex education . Just look at television today and you can see the current glamorization of teen pregnancy from Glee to Secret Life of the American Teenager to Teen Mom , to name only a few . <p> Teenagers who are questioning their sexuality ( i.e. , wondering if they might be gay ) are four times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers . They are also twice as likely to succeed . <p> In many states across the country , the law is very clear about sexual assault and the consumption of alcohol . If one or both participants in a sexual encounter are intoxicated and later allegations of rape are made , the law states that there was no consent . This means rape . That means that your son gets kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to register as a sex offender for life because he chose to get his date drunk first so she would have sex . <p> Hopefully by now you 're sufficiently convinced that the time has come to talk to your teenagers about sex . It is never too late to have this talk ! Honest education about healthy sexuality can protect them from disease , unplanned pregnancy and sexual assault . And more importantly , talking about sex is a perfect way to bridge the transition between parenting a child and mentoring a young adult . Your teenagers are about to walk across that bridge and it is this bridge that begins the wonderful adult relationship you are destined to have with your children and with theirs too . As they continue to look to you for guidance about other adult situations , it will be this open and honest dialog about the taboo subject of sex that they will look back at as the turning point in your relationship . <p> The bottom line is that if they can talk to you about sex and you can talk to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing you will be supportive , informative and non-judgmental .

On the one side , we are inundated by an exhibitionist ; anything goes sexuality in our pornographic-laden culture . On the other side , there is nothing , an empty and lonely place where most of us live with our questions about sexuality and wondering what is normative . Even most " Better Sex " videos are so graphic that integrating the images into practice is a far reach . I sell products which I assure will provide the tools for a longer and more satisfying sex life , but the longer I do it , the more I recognize that even the best lube in the world is not going to work if you do n't  know how to use it . So here 's a little guide to the steps of making a spark turn into flame in your bedroom . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desire does not always precede arousal . Often times if you give yourself a chance to explore the purely physical sensations of scent and touch , the body itself will open up by itself to desire . Many a night , we have a pre-set agreement for an intimate rendezvous and I arrive exhausted with no desire in sight . This is where love oil comes in . <p> Scent is experienced by the olfactory and registered in the limbic part of the brainwhere memory , emotion and sexuality is waiting to be stirred . Discovering desire is about waking up arousal , it is lighting the fuse . For me it feels like a process of falling deep into my body , a journey that awakens feelings of a thousand tiny fireworks just under the skin . Each and every time I take this journey of arousal , I realize again how cutoff I am from really feeling my body through most of my day . Good sex should always begin with this journey , where the goal is learning to feel everything . <p> 2 . Exploring Fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private fantasies that you would never repeat or enjoy visual candy in books or videos together , or actually plan out and try on roles together , healthy sexuality let 's us abandon our normal reasoning self for brief moments to let the bodies cravings lead the mind . Whether orgasm is easy or challenging to achieve has a lot to do with your ability to let go and experience the odd and fascinating part of being a sexual human . Experiencing the pleasure of intimate touch without any fear of being somehow abnormal ( which pretty much most people fear about their sexual selves at some point ) is how you move towards orgasm . You cant demand it , you can only make room for it . This is the place to experiment , see how different tactile surfaces and vibrations change and enhance your experiencethe flame builds . <p> 3 . Penetration and Lubrication I never pull out the lubricant until I cant stand it anymore , until I cant wait another minute . It would n't do its job in step one or step two , it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingness to do its job . Accepting anyone into you as deeply as intercourse provides for is a sacred and life changing moment . Lubrication eases the entry and creates a dynamic smooth gliding of tissue against tissue . Healthy lubricant ingredients not only soothe and heal during their use , but also build the elasticity and integrity of the tissue over time . There is nothing more explosive and deeply satisfying than sharing the fireworks of deep intimacy and connection of our most private selves . <p> Wendy Strgar is the founder of GoodCleanLove.com , which provides products and advice for sustainable love .

We are often more likely to discuss their thoughts and feelings when we do n't  have to describe them . <p> People who are depressed yearn for a sustained improvement in mood . Every time I visited my psychiatrist , he inevitably asked me to rate my mood from 0 to 10 , which actually led me to create my own moodometer . I found giving these ratings to be a very valuable resource for tracking my moods and progress . If someone is having difficulty discussing feelings , she may respond better to giving this type of rating or even multiple choice .

" <p> A romantic relationship is like a long journey in a car : sometimes , you travel on straight , smooth roads . At other times , the roads become narrow and treacherous , filled with potholes , barriers , and roadblocks . Your car may break down , and you and your partner may think about leaving the car and going it alone . As a couple , how can you cope with lifes unending detours ? Here are five steps to help you navigate an ever-changing , obstacle-filled road : <p> Step 1 : Survey the road . ?

Make small gestures that show you still care , and that you want to make a commitment to move forward together . <p> Step 2 : Unearth what 's causing the damage. ? The majority of issues in relationships are n't  caused by the relationship itself , they are caused by hidden emotions and unconscious ties to the past . Our views of love and relationships start in childhood and stick to us like an ever-present shadow , following us from one relationship to the next .

Be aware that they 're triggered/reacting . Its not okay for Brandon to yell at Nicole , and for Nicole to yell at Brandon .

The Tenth Commandment gives you that permission.BY LYNNE Z. GOLD-BIKIN <p> BigStockPhoto Finding alone time is just as important in a marriage as together time . <p> There is nothing more wonderful than a good solid relationship where you enjoy each other , enjoy spending time with each other , and share common interests . That does not , however , mean that you have to be together all of the time and do everything together . <p> In order to enjoy your time together and to maintain a good marriage , its important to allow yourself special time for you . This might be exercise time , reading time , watching a ball game or even enjoying the luxury of a massage . The point is , in order to be at your best in your partnership , you must feel good about yourself . That means that , occasionally , its okay to take care of you . You do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yourself to rest or just pamper yourself with a hot bath or long shower , a good book or a crossword puzzle . The fact that you may need this time does n't  mean that you do n't  love your partner . Its an acknowledgement that we all need space occasionally . Remember what the flight attendant says to you at the beginning of every flight ; if the plane loses air pressure and those little yellow cups fall from the ceiling , if you 're traveling with a small child , put your face mask on first . If you want to be at your best as a spouse , take care of your self first . <p> Also , you may find that you and the love of your life do n't  share every interest together . One of you may like to go to yoga class , for example , while the other is a couch potato . Its not a rejection of the relationship for you to find a friend to exercise with you , so long as its for exercise only and not to stray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while their wives do not . Having the guys over occasionally gives you alone time and allows him to follow his sports teams . <p> Its a gift to the relationship to be able to acknowledge that each of you can still enjoy your individual interests without your spouse and not demand that your partner give up the things that he/she enjoys to be with you . You do n't  want to smother your spouse or make constant demands to always be together ; and you do n't  want him or her to do that with you . <p> As the marriage grows , you may find the balance between those individual interests and your together time . It is often possible to grow to like each others hobbies and passions . Compromises also can come into play . If one likes to vacation at the shore while the other likes the mountains , rotating the vacations is always an optionprovided you 're not grumpy when the vacation is not your choice . You can learn to bowl if he loves the sport , even if its not your first choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when he or she is in the bowling league to have your special time , that 's also part of the compromise that makes a marriage strong . On the other hand , if there are too many things you ca n't share , you 'll ultimately grow apart and have little in common . <p> The need for alone time is not a rejection of the relationship . It is an acknowledgement that the marriage of two people is a joining of two individuals together . Think of it as an image of a " Y , " two people together who merge sometimes , but maintain their individuality . The alone time makes you healthier as a spouse and happier as an individual .

" <p> This past weekend I enjoyed a bachelorette party with my best friend from college . For two days , a houseful of women gathered to celebrate love and the new beginnings of marriage . It was a wonderful weekend to reflect of the joys of new love . In the early stages of marriage many couples would say that their love for one another is unconditional . There is much talk of loving each other regardless of flaws and finding the " perfect partner . " I know that some experts may disagree with the idea of unconditional love between partnersciting issues of co-dependency and enmeshmentbut in my view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one another that supersedes any faults or flaws . Call me a hopeless romantic , but I believe that love , even between spouses , can and should be unconditional . <p> Unconditional love is the idea that our affection for each other is not based on a certain set of behaviors or characteristics . Its the idea that you love your wife because of who she is not only if she stays a size six or cooks dinner every night . Its the kind of love that engaged and newlywed couples believe in . Unconditional love is the kind of love that you have for a person not in spite of , but because of their flaws . Your love is all that makes them who they are and would n't have it any other way . Its blissful and wonderful until real life starts to intrude . <p> Rather than talk about the way they want to treat each other and the set ground rules for managing conflict , couples usually start out too drunk on love and lust to pay much attention to the logistics of sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and suddenly realize that we do n't  necessarily like everything that 's been going on . Suddenly what was cute or quirky is irritating . Your husbands ambition , which was once sexy and powerful seems arrogant and self-serving . Or your wifes attention to detail may suddenly seem like nit-picking and controlling . This is the moment where couples start to wonder what went wrong . How could someone who loves us unconditionally find fault with who we are ? The problem must be with love right ? <p> Setting Ground Rules The obvious thing to say here is that the love has changed , that our spouse no longer loves us unconditionally , but that 's usually not the case . The truth is that most couples I meet at this point are just as in love with each other as ever . The problem is not that their love has changed , but that the rules of the relationship were never established or are in need of an update . You see , while love can be unconditional , healthy relationships need rules . <p> I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love that once dictated your behavior . The fact is , however , that relationships need boundaries in order to sustain the stress and challenges of life . I often compare the need for boundaries or relationship rules with parenting . In general , parents love their children unconditionally , but in order to raise children there must be rules . This is how we teach them to get along with others and learn to understand the place in the world . Rules or boundaries allow a child ( or a spouse ) to clearly understand how to have positive interactions with the people they love and how to effectively express their needs . The happiest , most secure children are those who live with parents that are comfortable and clear in expressing their love and expectations . Intimate relationships , like marriage , need the same guidance to create a secure and lasting bond . <p> Boundaries are simply rules of engagement , a set of guides for how we interact and what we need from other people . Boundaries allow each person to maintain their individuality and grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Boundaries also protect the commitment of a marriage and foster long-lasting , healthy emotional connections . It is healthy boundaries with the outside world that help some couples remain faithful while others may struggle with issues of infidelity or mistrust . Boundaries also protect individuals in the relationship from abuse and exploitation . While you may love your spouse without conditions that does not mean you ought to live with them in an unsafe or emotionally detrimental situation . Boundaries allow us to love freely and deeply while establishing a clear understanding of what is acceptable . <p> Your Path to Unconditional Love So how do we keep our deep and unconditional love while establishing clear and healthy rules for our relationships ? Open communication and honest personal reflection are key . Whether it is negotiating how you will manage your finances or understanding how and when you need to be comforted and encouraged , establishing relationship rules requires both partners to be open and honest with themselves and each other . These moments of honesty and clarity are not always going to come in the form of civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unexpected and the things you learn are not always what you want to hear . If you can take the risk to be honest and vulnerable in these times , you may find the key to move your marriage forward in a positive way . <p> A favorite marriage moment for me in which my husband and I established rules around maintaining our home life came when , in the midst of an argument , I accused him of not being as much of a " modern " man as he claimed . In a moment of frustration I told him that he wanted an old-school wife that would stay home and cook and clean for him , not an equal partner as he always proclaimed . I said he was a chauvinist and truly expected him to be offended and defend his prior commitment to having a modern marriage where we shared everything 50/50 . Instead , I got a moment of honest communication . Much to my surprise I was right and had just put words to what he had been struggling with for some months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and me about what he really wanted in our marriage . <p> It turns out that what he really wanted was for me to play a more " traditional " role at home ; not exactly a role that fit with the very independent , modern feminist woman he married . That does n't  mean that I quit my job and stayed home ironing shirts all day to fulfill his desire . Nor did I pack my bags and leave to find someone who wanted a wife that would rather pursue graduate school and career than mop floors and change diapers . Instead , we finally had an honest platform from which to negotiate our own rules about how we would manage our domestic and family responsibilities . Interestingly enough , we both learned more about who we really were in the process . It turns out that I am more traditional than I thought and thoroughly enjoyed staying at home with our children , while going to school and pursuing part-time ventures . He found that he was , in fact , a lot more like the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking care of babies . Thankfully we learned these lessons together and were able to be supportive of each others goals and needs . No matter where you are in your relationship , the unconditional love can last a lifetime .

" <p> Having an argument with your sweetie can ruin your dayor even your week . Wouldnt you love to learn the art of disagreeing without hurting each other ? You can become a master in managing conflict within your marriage by following a few basic steps with dedication . Occasional quarrels are a natural and healthy part of relationships . Differing opinions are not problematic when managed in a positive , respectful manner . A multitude of conscious and unconscious factors play into each couples unique conflict management patterns . While good , clean fighting habits can keep lines of communication clear and open , destructive fighting patterns can truly wreak havoc on a relationship over time . When we do n't  strive to become more aware and mindful of our habits and patterns , our unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Its important to hone in on both the healthy and unhealthy aspects of the dynamics of conflict currently at work in your marriage . This is an important first step in moving closer to healthy communication patterns . By first developing a clear and honest picture of current patterns , partners can begin to create healthy habits that support , rather than damage , their relationship . <p> The process does n't  have to be difficult or imposing , but it does take commitment and perseverance . By learning to take a step back to look at your communication patterns in a nonjudgmental , objective way , you might even find yourself laughing at some of the dynamics that come to light . While one partner can work on this issue solo , the effects are incredibly effective when a couple works in tandem to learn how to " fight fair . " If unproductive , hurtful arguments are harming your relationship , you can learn how to pave the way to healthy communication one step at a time ! <p> Step 1 : Learn the Communication Basics <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " assertive , " " aggressive , " " passive , " and " passive-aggressive . " Assertive communicators tend to speak clearly and confidently with open , self-assured body language . A well-balanced assertive communicator will offer an honest opinion and be willing to respect and hear alternative points of view . The aggressive communicator often speaks loudly , uses overpowering body language , and may utilize threatening or intimidating words or behaviors in order to get a unilateral point of view across . The passive communicator may speak softly and timidly , and the corresponding body language is often submissive and meek . Passive-aggressive communicators may appear accommodating on the surface , yet they resort to expressing disagreement or anger by engaging in subversive or harmful behaviors in an indirect , roundabout manner . Once you know what to look for , it can become easy to identify communication styles . As an example , a passive communicator may not realize that his timid speech , hunched shoulders , and downcast eyes are indicative of a passive communication style . Similarly , a woman who places her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her partners face " may not realize that these habits indicate an aggressive communication style . Take the opportunity to look at how you communicate with your spouse . Do you tend to be assertive , aggressive , passive , or passive-aggressive ? With as much objectivity as possible , make a mental note of the style you tend to adopt . <p> Step 2 : Identify Your Conflict Management Style <p> Several common conflict management styles tend to arise in relationships . Some styles of handling conflict add to the health of a relationship , while other styles cause either subtle or overt damage over time . Behaviors learned from early childhood through adult life affect how we handle conflict . Over time , various fighting styles are modeled by parents , siblings , and friends ; these patterns are unconsciously mimicked and adopted over time . In this way , each individual tends to become accustomed to a certain style of communicating and handling disagreements . Interestingly , a persons conflict management style is not necessarily static and can vary depending upon the situations and people involved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . As you read , notice if you see yourself in any of the descriptions . <p> " Interestingly , a persons conflict management style is not necessarily static and can vary depending upon the situations and people involved . " <p> Abusive Bully : The abusive bully tends to be highly aggressive and confrontational . " It 's my way or the highway " is a common attitude for the bully . Name-calling , threats , demeaning comments , and sarcasm are tools commonly used in this style of fighting . The bully thrives by controlling and overpowering others . Maintaining power at all costs is the name of the game for the bully . This style of fighting is terribly toxic and harmful to relationships . <p> Dominator : Similar to the bully , the dominator wants to silence opposing points of view . Rather than resorting to open abuse , the dominator will aggressively maneuver and compete to ensure that differing opinions are quashed . The dominator utilizes powerful verbal and nonverbal behavior to maintain control in the fight . Compared to the abusive bully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulative manner in striving for power and control . In the dominators eyes , the name of the game is winning . <p> Poor Victim : The victim tends to take whatever is dished out during disagreements . Instead of speaking out or standing up honestly and assertively , the victim tends to fall into a trap of denying , making excuses , or blaming others to avoid personal responsibility . The victim often displays emotions ( such as crying out of frustration , sadness , shame , or anxiety ) , but there is normally a severe lack of appropriate open and authentic reflection and communication . The victims goal may be to retreat , sidestep responsibility , or gain sympathy . <p> Silent Sulker : Similar to the victim , the sulker lacks healthy boundaries for managing conflict . The sulker timidly and silently absorbs the heat of the conflict . After an argument , however , the sulker may make his or her displeasure known by refusing to communicate openly and may not speak at all for hours or even days . In order to release anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slamming of doors , clattering of dishes , blaring music , or nearly inaudible muttering . The sulker makes a point by pushing back in quiet anger . <p> The Kitchen Sinkerator : This style tends to store up past hurts and wrongs over time . When an argument arises , many of the unresolved issues from the past are thrown into the argument . Instead of focusing on the issue at hand , everything but the kitchen sink is tossed into the mix during arguments . The disagreement becomes inflated and the core issue is often completely lost . This conflict style tends to cause confusion , increased disharmony , and frustration . The individual employing this style tends to completely lose sight of the goal . <p> Compartmentalizer : The compartmentalizer finds safety in resorting to personal logic and facts during times of strife . If an issue ca n't be rationalized , logically sorted , or assimilated into a preset paradigm , it is put out of sight and out of mind . To avoid dissonance and the anxiety that comes with discord , the compartmentalizer attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and packing away discord , overt dissension is avoided . Conflict is managed by believing that a matter is either " right or wrong , " and issues are often classified into specific , concrete categories . The compartmentalizers goal is to avoid anxiety and keep the perceived untidiness of conflict at bay . <p> Avoider : The avoider simply does not like becoming unsettled by any form of conflict . It is common for the avoider to shut down and close off to charged emotions , arguments , and situations that might involve conflict . The avoider strives to avoid open disagreement , seemingly oblivious to the fact that avoidance itself is actually a style of fighting . The avoidance style utilizes myriad tactics to avoid conflict . Whether working late , zoning out by drinking , playing an Xbox through the night , or facing the computer screen rather than a partner , the avoider will do almost anything to avoid overt confrontation . The name of the game for the avoider is to maintain homeostasis by pretending that conflict does not exist ! <p> Passive-Aggressive Player : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to obtain it openly . This fighting style often employs a submissive facade that covers simmering frustration , anger , and conflict . The passive-aggressive fighter does not know how to get his or her needs met in a healthy manner and resorts to utilizing a pattern of destructive tactics or vengeful strategies behind the scenes . If left unchecked , the foundation of a relationship can be steadily eroded by the harmful games and stealthy " payback " methods employed . The passive-aggressive player strives to equalize the playing field through retribution . <p> Open and Accepting : This style of conflict management tends to be empathic and forgiving . A person with an open and accepting style sees disagreements as a time to be heard , yet there is also a desire to hear and acknowledge other points of view . Knowing that open , productive conflict is healthy for a marriage , this style makes room for diverging opinions and conflict . Emotional expressions are honored and seen as normal venting processes . When disagreements and conflict arise , homeostasis is restored by respecting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game for this fighting style is " live and let live . " <p> The Explorer : The explorer is similar in many ways to the open and accepting style . In addition , understanding and growth tend to be paramount for the explorer . The explorer views conflict as an educational experience . Disagreements are seen as vehicles to engender greater understanding within the relationship . Healthy conflict is viewed as a normal and beneficial aspect of partnership . This fighting style appreciates the importance of facilitating awareness and cooperation during conflict . The name of the game for the explorer is utilizing conflict to keep the relationship dynamic and strong . <p> Step 3 : Self-Awareness is the Key <p> Now that you are aware of the basic styles of communication and conflict , you are ready to move forward into healthier behaviors by consciously increasing your awareness of your own habits ! When each partner focuses on his or her own patterns , rather than on what the other person is doing " wrong , " the trouble-presenting issues are often diminished automatically . The simple explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both partners become introspective and focused on self-responsibility , the heat of the battle turns down . The focus of the disagreement shifts from " I am right ! " to " How can I communicate my needs or feelings more calmly , clearly , and honestly ? " <p> " Every person has a unique history and vantage point , so it is makes perfect sense that partners might often have different perspectives on one situation ! " <p> Step 4 : Learn to Really Listen <p> Notice if you are preparing counterattacks as your partner speaks . If you are doing this , you are not able to really listen fully and openly . When our mind is busy preparing the next argument , the focus has shifted from hearing the others point of view to preparing for the next go-round . If you are accustomed to being on the defensive or the offensive , it can be a bit difficult to learn to sit back and listen respectively . Once you get into the habit of engaging your full attention on hearing your partners side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth on the table . Rarely is there only one " right " or one " wrong . " Every person has a unique history and vantage point , so it is makes perfect sense that partners might often have different perspectives on one situation ! <p> Step 5 : Understand Your Style <p> Evaluate your personal communication style . Once you understand the various styles of communication , it is easier to identify the style you tend to adopt . In an open and non-judgmental manner , explore the pros and cons of your personal communication style . A sense of deeper partnership can emerge as you and your spouse develop a better understanding of the unconscious patterns that have been at work . Armed with a better understanding of your personal style and how your habits can be improved , it becomes easier to notice when harmful patterns creep in . <p> Step 6 : Get Clear , Positive , Respectful , and Assertive <p> Its easy to misunderstand the idea of healthy assertive communication . An assertive communicator strives to be clear , straightforward , and focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will confidently express thoughts and feelings while also making plenty of room for alternative ideas and approaches . A hallmark of healthy assertive communication is a deep respect for the self , the other , and the relationship . Another key element of assertive communication is its focus on direct and open communication as opposed to indirect , unclear patterns . Even with its many benefits , some people are unaccustomed to or uncomfortable with the idea of asserting themselves . <p> Although assertive communication is the preferred and most effective method of communication , many people resort to passive or passive-aggressive communication due to unconscious beliefs that assertive people are rude , ill-mannered , unacceptable , or aggressive . In addition , many women avoid assertive communication fearing that they will be seen as unfeminine or impolite . By better understanding the productive and essential aspects of assertive communication , the idea of communicating assertively becomes acceptable and , therefore , possible . Positive , assertive communication pays off by taking the focus off of fighting and shifting it to communicating , understanding , and connecting . <p> Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about finding common ground and less about making a point and finding differences , communication tends to become much more relaxed and balanced . With an eye toward cooperatively reaching an understanding or goal , defenses come and collaborative energy rises . Assertive communication allows partners to focus on supporting the relationship through a deep sense of cooperation . This is an important element in that the other communication styles ( aggressive , passive , and passive-aggressive ) are focused on power . Assertive communication rests on habits that are geared toward being partners rather than competitors . By coming to understand the basic styles of communication , the stage has been set for understanding how these patterns affect the fighting styles that arise during times of conflict . Through becoming more aware of fighting styles , couples learn how to direct their frustrations and concerns into habits that promote " fighting fair . " <p> " When disagreements become more about finding common ground and less about making a point and finding differences , communication tends to become much more relaxed and balanced . " <p> Step 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on yourself or your spouse as you learn how to engage in healthier communication patterns . Behaviors that you may have learned in early childhood wont change overnight . Be patient with yourself and your partner as you navigate the road to healthier communication ! With respect , patience , and commitment , your marriage will strengthen as new patterns develop steadily . <p> Step 9 : Notice the Change <p> Just like when you were a kid , it can feel terrific to get a " gold star " for effort . When you catch yourself or your spouse communicating in a way that feels more positive , take note ! For example , you can highlight what is working by saying to partner , " Honey , it felt so wonderful when we took time to talk this morning . I loved the way you looked me in the eyes while I was sharing my thoughts . " When you notice that you are communicating more positively , it can be reinforcing to reflect on your own progress . For instance , you might think to yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without taking a jab at my sweetie ! " Reinforce what is working and strive to do just a bit better each day . Before you know it , you 'll have your own black belt in communication and conflict management ! <p> Remember , every relationship is as unique as its partners . The descriptions outlined above are intended to give you an insightful yet humorous look at just a few common patterns that contribute to marital discord . Communication and conflict management styles vary from person to person , so strive for a nonjudgmental stance when evaluating patterns within your own relationships . Rather than honing in on your faults or those of your spouse , take an open and candid look at the habits that are not working for you . By reflecting honestly on how you can improve your communication and conflict management abilities , you support your own psychological health and growthand that of your marriage .

The fence should be hard to climb ( not chain-link ) and have a self-latching , self-closing gate . Families may consider pool alarms and rigid pool covers as additional layers of protection , but neither can take the place of a fence . <p> * Parents , caregivers and pool owners should learn CPR . <p> * Do not use air-filled swimming aids ( such as inflatable arm bands ) in place of life jackets .

CARLA MARIE MANLY <p> DepositPhotos It 's possible to come back from betrayal with a stronger marriage than before , because you 're forced to address the issues that led to the problems . <p> " There are no shortcuts , no fast track , and no way to circumvent the intricate processes that each individuals psyche needs to heal . " <p> When betrayal strikes , everything seems to change ; nothing seems untouched by the effects that create havoc in the relationship and the couples world at large . Healing from betrayal is no easy task , for an act of betrayal can cause significant trauma . While the mind reels from fears , worries , and confusion , the heart and spirit are affected by painful emotions such as sadness , anger , resentment , and shame . <p> Physiologically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as headaches , exhaustion , sleeplessness , and digestive issues . Each person is unique , and depending upon a partners history , it may feel as though stability and trust will never be regained . If one partner has a history that includes complex issues such as anxiety , depression , PTSD ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) , abandonment , or prior betrayal issues , an act of betrayal may trigger any issues and fears that were not fully resolved . <p> Due to its wide-reaching effects , the process involved in healing from betrayal is often much like healing from grief . The five stages of grief include denial , anger , bargaining , depression , and acceptance . Although full processed grief will ultimately result in complete acceptance , the first four stages do not necessarily occur in a linear fashion . When looking at these stages in regard to healing from betrayal , the betrayed person may cycle in and out of denial , anger , bargaining , and depression . For example , just when the anger begins to subside , feelings of depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift , thoughts of denial may return : " I cant believe this is happening to me ! I cant believe he ( or she ) would cheat on me . . . lie to me . . . ruin our marriage . " As with the grief , it is vital that the upwelling of emotions and thoughts be acknowledged . True healing results only by going through the stages as they arise . There are no shortcuts , no fast track , and no way to circumvent the intricate processes that each individuals psyche needs to heal . <p> " Apologies and promises will mean little until the painwhich includes agony , fear , and distrustis given deep and appropriate attention . " <p> As outlined in my first article in this series , it is vital that the pain of betrayal be processed in order to move through the emotions and resounding effects of betrayal . As each human is unique , there is no timeline for this first important step ; depending upon the person and the level of betrayal experienced , it can take weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful emotions that arise . True healing is impossible if the emotions and thoughts are ignored , marginalized , or left unattended . This step takes great courage , faith , and support ; it is vital that both partners work together to move through the upheaval that often occurs when the betrayal comes to light . Apologies and promises will mean little until the painwhich includes agony , fear , and distrustis given deep and appropriate attention . <p> The second article in the series on betrayal focused on understanding the root causes of betrayal . This step , too , is critical in the healing process . It is human nature to be fearful of that , which is not understood . Betrayalregardless of the typecan cause a deep sense of mistrust to arise . The relationship may not feel at all safe until there is a deep and genuine understanding of what went awry . In truth , it is difficult to create a renewed sense of trust until there is a true belief that the offending behavior will change . By discussing and coming to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the futurethe pathway to confidence and trust begins to unfold . This process can be slow and painstaking , and it requires that the betrayer take full responsibility for his or her actions . As this occurs , each partner can also strive to assess old behaviors , thought patterns , and habits that might impede a healthy relationship . When these processes are faced with honesty and heartfelt accountability , the relationship can become more stable and healthy . <p> " In truth , it is difficult to create a renewed sense of trust until there is a true belief that the offending behavior will change . " <p> When the first two aspects of the " post-betrayal " process are given conscious attention , a foundation for deep healing has been set .

" If the betrayed person has any doubt that the betrayer has reformed and will not relapse into further betrayals in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficial and transitory . As much as he or she might want to be convinced that all is well , suspicions may arise if the foundational work is not thorough and strong .

Knowing that ones partner has truly reformed allows the relationship to be rebuilt from the ground up . Patience , dedication , and commitment to the relationship are key . True healing will take time , but the health of the relationship is worth every minute invested . <p> Many people want to believe that an apology will make an act of betrayal disappear . This is wishful thinking . Although a heartfelt apology is an essential element of the healing process , an apology itself is not enough . If the words , " I 'm sorry " come without deep introspection of what caused the improper behavior and a true awareness of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite meaningless . When the offending person makes a committed effort to become more self-aware in order to change the negative behavior , the apology becomes truly meaningful . Faith is fostered when the betrayed party can feel and see that the betrayer is striving to regain and rebuild trust . <p> " True healing will take time , but the health of the relationship is worth every minute invested . " <p> Most couples find tremendous support from reaching out for the guidance of a skilled psychotherapist , secular advisor , or religious counselor . A neutral , objective person can help each person listen to the others perspective without the damaging effects of blame , toxic emotions , or other unhealthy behaviors . For those not skilled in communicating effectively , the healing process often requires that a skilled professional be present to allow the healing to unfold with clarity and respect . As the partners learn to listen to and validate each others thoughts and emotions without blame or criticism , a sense of unity and trust results . When the healing process is honored with awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . When partners become devoted to openly and honestly addressing whatever might arise in the course of the relationship , betrayal does not become an option . Honest , clear , and respectful communication is the best preventative prescription for the health of every relationship . <p> Learning how to hold steady , persevere , and grow through whatever challenges come in the course of the marriage takes incredible dedication . In reality , it takes a great deal of workand heavy doses of forgivenessto restore faith and trust after a betrayal has occurred .

I do n't  want to be a nag but its starting to get to me . Let me know what I can do . <p> Being a " child of the ' 60 's , " I can certainly appreciate the comment , " Its only pot .

Anytime someone does anything to an extreme , it does raise a question of addiction . Addictions are a way of escaping or not dealing with some other issue . Certainly people are familiar with the " hard " addictions like gambling , drinking or using drugs . But people can also be involved in " soft " addictions like workaholism , shopaholism , etc . In any of these situations , the behavior in moderation is fine ; its when the person does it too much that it raises a " red flag . " <p> Whenever someone writes in with a query , it raises lots of other questions for me . You state that your husband is a " pothead . " So , my first thought is exactly how much pot is he indulging in ? Understand that each person will have their own perspective . What may be an extensive use to you may be minimal to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking ? That is to say , does he only use it when he is with friends and when he is out socially , say on the weekends ?

If you present this in an understanding way , you wont be seen as a nag . <p> Finally , the other main issue is how his behavior is affecting your relationship . At the very least , you state that when your spouse uses pot , he becomes " lethargic and unmotivated . " From what you indicate , you have let him know your feelings on this matter yet he continues to smoke . It is understandable that you would feel disrespected by his lack of consideration . <p> If there is no other issue , then you do need to let him know matter-of-factly that this is a behavior that really makes you uncomfortable and that his refusal to minimize his use sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or respect your feelings . <p> Sometimes , in relationships there are tough matters that must be dealt with .

It can provide a context for humor , teasing and lightheartedness , especially during times of stressful transition . " <p> My husband has been challenging me for the longest time to a game of pool . And anyone who knows me well knows that I am spherically challenged . In other words , I tend not to do well in games that involve balls . But why should I let that stop me ? Is it not the spirit of the game that counts and not how well I actually do ? <p> Investigating the role which leisure plays in long-term relationships , Dr. Dennis Orthner , a leading researcher in this field , concludes that in the critical stages of relationship adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cement the relationship . According to him , these critical adjustment phases include the relationships first four years when it is initially being defined and the second half , when the kids are leaving for college or to set up their own homes . <p> In the middle years , leisure seemed not to be as significant a predictor of relationship satisfaction . This was attributed to the fact that relationships during this phase often become consumed with child-focused activity and the other rudiments of building a life together . This places play and leisure on the back-burner , consequently rendering it a difficult variable to assess . <p> When we put all relationship variables aside and study both the psychology and physiology of play , we know that engaging in such activities can have a positive impact on both the mind and the body . Whether it 's a simple board game or a more taxing game of tennis , swimming or running together , engaging in activities which bring both pleasure and encourages healthy competitiveness , can add a new dimension to our significant relationships .

When we feel relaxed , we are in a better mood and that sense of renewal can improve the levels of goodwill and emotional intimacy experienced in our relationships . <p> Research also confirms that physical activity is positively correlated to a better sex life . Fitness regimens like weight-lifting can , in fact , increase testosterone production making it easier for both men and women to experience sexual desire and arousal . The feel good endorphins produced by a workout at the gym or by an active session on the dance floor mirror those released during orgasm . Physical activity is , therefore , a great way to rev-up our engines for a different type of play in the bedroom . When we feel strong , healthy and fit , we are also likely to have a better self-image and will perhaps seek to celebrate this sense of well-being with our husband or wife . <p> Creating a space in our relationships for play is , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Choose a play-date time that is practical or doable for your lifestyle and make it work for you . This may be several times a week for shared workout times or walking exercise , to once a week or every other week for activities like pool , board games or computer games . The point here is to find a shared activity which interests you both . <p> 2 . If you 're not a games or exercise buff , finding time to share leisure can be as diverse as you desire .

This can only benefit the overall relationship since the objective of play and leisure should be to foster couple-intimacy and not to enforce separateness . <p> 4 . When games or leisure activities take place in a group setting , they can provide an excellent context for cheering on and encouraging our partner . Playing games against other couples can also strengthen our couple-resolve and indicate that in addition to encouraging each other as playmates , were really on the same team for life .

The sooner we let our children in on this secret the healthier their life-approach will be . Forgiveness is many things , but we also must teach that forgiveness does n't  always mean reconciliation . It is not about condoning harms , which have been done .

Our child has already been hurt , the assault has happened and no amount of their anger or sadness can or will change that .

The problem isyes , you guessed itwe do n't  live in a perfect world . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our own parents , especially if they are controlling and manipulative . In order for your spouse to confront his ( or her ) parents about their destructive behavior , he must ( 1 ) realize their behavior is destructive , and ( 2 ) have the courage to confront them about it . Without proper counseling or education , it may be nearly impossible for your partner to realize his parents are controlling , intrusive , and/or manipulative . Why ? Because they are his definition of " normal . " Even if you are fortunate enough to have a spouse who recognizes that his parents behavior is a threat to your marriage , he may not have the courage to confront them . <p> There are things you can say and do to help your spouse recognize destructive behavior and be courageous enough to draw boundaries with his folks ( I cover this in detail in my new book ) . However , this is not an overnight process . For many years , your partner has learned false beliefs from his parents . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually he is an adult on an equal level with them . It could take a long time to re-define normal by replacing his faulty thinking with the truth . <p> So then what should you do while you are waiting for that perfect world in which you are united as a couple to deal with difficult in-laws ? Are you doomed to remain in the role of a helpless victim ? Should you be silent while your in-laws behavior wreaks havoc on your marriage ? Certainly not ! You can do what is in your power to protect your marriage . In other words , while you are waiting to gain your spouses loyalty , you can draw healthy boundaries with his parents . <p> Here are four important things to remember when drawing boundaries : <p> 1 . Treat your in-laws the way you 'd want your spouse to treat your own parents . In other words , be respectful , mature and tactful . <p> 2 . You can only draw boundaries effectively on issues that affect you . For example , you can control how often you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls ) , but you ca n't control when your spouse talks to them . <p> 3 . In some situations its better to gain respect by standing up for yourself rather than expecting your husband to rescue you . For example , if your father-in-law teases you about your weight , you could say , " Its not okay for you to tease me about my weight . " <p> 4 . You ca n't force your in-laws to change their behavior , but you can change your own behavior . If you start to speak and behave in a different way , then they will likely change their behavior . For example , you cant force them to stop dropping by unexpectedly , but if you stop answering the door , they probably wo n't keep showing up . At first your in-laws will probably be upset by your behavior , but eventually they will learn to expect it , and then you will have re-defined " normal . " <p> While its true that you ca n't force your partner to draw boundaries with his parents , here 's what you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between healthy and destructive behavior 2 . Communicate your feelings and needs to him in a calm , gentle manner 3 . Focus on reaching loving compromises <p> It wont be easy for your partner to transform from a parent pleaser into a loyal spouse , but I can tell you from personal experience that it is possible . In the meantime , do n't  be afraid to draw boundaries with your in-laws . Its better to speak the truth in loveeven if it causes a few hurt feelingsthan to stay silent while your marriage suffers . <p> Jenna D.

@@79605203 @1105203/ <p> Bridging the Divide With GratitudeOne of the most powerful emotions we can feel is loss . By embracing this emotion we can tap into an appreciation that might seem out of reach.BY WENDY STRGAR <p> DepositPhotos It 's when we embrace the inevitable loss that we truly grasp an appreciation for what we have . <p> " There is so little time to love . The most memorable moments we share with those we love occur inside this fragile , tender space in which gratitude and grief meet in our hearts . " <p> " You do n't  know what you 've got ' til its gone " Joni Mitchell <p> The shock has not lifted for me . Each day I continue to feel dazed and overwhelmed with grief by this world that is emerging . And yet , as I have written before , the more deeply I accompany my grief , the more resounding are my feelings of gratitude . When we allow ourselves to befriend loss and know it for the lifelong companion it is , you would have to be a fool to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways life is working right in this moment , but even more sofor all the people that you love and have ever loved . This is , in fact , what it means to grow up or at least grow old , to acknowledge that loss is the inevitable outcome when we love . As we see all around us , a collective sense of loss in this nation is moving us to love it more , to be ready to fight for what it means to be American . <p> If maturity does anything , it makes it easier to see how our experience of loss and grief are not just a consequence of death , but rather an emotional response that creates meaning when relationships end , friendships wither , homes burn down and elections go terribly wrong . We have and we let go , that is the nature of life and love . For better or worse , the more we love the more we have to lose . Ironically , it is when we wake up to all that there is to losewhen we finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast sea of lossthat we truly experience being alive . <p> Gratitude is not really something we think , rather it is a visceral " feeling " when we wake up to both the uncertainty of our existence and the truth of how fleeting this life really is . There is so little time to love . The most memorable moments we share with those we love occur inside this fragile , tender space in which gratitude and grief meet in our hearts . <p> " How many more times in this life will you sit over a pile of turkey and mashed potatoes with these people who bandaged your scraped knees or held you up so you could see the parade ? " <p> Living inside of gratitude during these times of profound uncertainty and change is sometimes as close as the intimacy that is exchanged between strangers at a protest . When we give our time to demonstrating our values , we are awake to how many other people share them . This is one powerful way of how gratitude transforms the experience of loss . Even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude is the force which can alter our sense of alienation from each other . All it takes is reminding ourselves that even beyond the chasm of fears and outrage that separate us , the family that you love to disagree with will too soon be gone . How many more times in this life will you sit over a pile of turkey and mashed potatoes with these people who bandaged your scraped knees or held you up so you could see the parade ? <p> It is easy to lose sight of how fragile and temporary our ability to love really is as we move through the day to day details of maintaining life . I remember well the relentless grind of sporting events , laundry piles , meal preps/ clean-ups and homework among my four kids that left me little space to appreciate how much I loved my kids . At the moments when I would forget how precious they were to me , and maybe more frequently than I would like to admit , I would shake myself awake to the gift of them by the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watching them walk away from me at their elementary school door , or now as I do at their dorm room or an airport entrance and letting myself deeply feel the brief , intense pang of the loss I would feel if I was to never see them again . It always brings me to tears . <p> This might be the most powerful tactic to use in your upcoming holidays with family that might not be perceiving the changes in the world as you are . Making yourself conscious of the inevitable loss of the people you love despite your differences is how you build a bridge to them in the moment . Court your grief and let it pull you deeper into the recognition of all that there is left to lose . And then miraculously even among the deep divisions of the direction in our nation , you will be surprised to sense that family runs deeper still . <p> " Making yourself conscious of the inevitable loss of the people you love despite your differences is how you build a bridge to them in the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactic is self-punishment , but I think of it more as preparation for the moment when it will be truewhen I will not see or hear or feel them again . Cognitively we know this is true , that grief is our reward for a life well loved . Yet we resist the experience , even for a moment , thinking it morose to invite the feeling in . To the contrary , what I have found is that courting my relationship to grief has been the most powerful way for me to expand into a profound physical sensation of gratitude . All the minutiae , conflict and details fall away and I am left in the heartbreaking space that the letting go of our love generates . The Buddhists call this space the Bodhichitta and consider it to be one of the most holy relationships we can cultivate in this life . In our heartbreak , not only does gratitude fill us , but we have a capacity for compassion that we did n't  know existed . <p> " Cognitively we know this is true , that grief is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gratitude that springs from relating to our grief is the doorway to remembering how good we have it .

Hailing from Missouri City , Texas , Crystal and Johnnie were fixed up by his dad . Their first date was at a Houston Rockets NBA game , and a year and a half later , Johnnie proposed at another Rockets game . They currently live with Johnnies parents in a home with 10 other relatives and are the youngest couple on ABCs " Here Come the Newlyweds . " <p> 1 Why did you decide to be part of the show ? Johnnie : One of my co-workers saw it online a day before the casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance . It was pouring down rain . A lot of things were telling us to not go , but something was just telling us that this was going to be our time and we 'd finally be able to get on TV and showcase and prove to the whole world that there 's a couple out there that really got it going on . Nice young couplehandsome you know . Laughs . Beautiful lady . <p> 2 What were some of the challenges of being on the show ?

Did you learn anything new about each other on the show ? Johnnie : I learned so much . It started to make me think about why we got married . No , I 'm just playing . You learn different things . First of all , you 're in a house , and there 's really nothing else to do except for the challenges , so there 's a lot more time to sit down and really get to know each other . Its like a real long vacation for us , so we definitely enjoyed that experience . Crystal : With us normally living in a house with a lot of people , you really ca n't just sit down and have " us time . " With us being away and out of the house we really learned more about each other than we probably wouldve being at home . <p> 4 What have been the rewards for you , as a couple , of being on the show ?

With us just starting out , before we got to the show , we were only married for about three or four months , so we were really new to it . <p> Johnnie : And we were the youngest couple.Crystal : and all the challenges helped give us a reality check . Like , this is what you 're going to have to deal with . This is what you 're going to have to change . This is what you 're going to have to sacrifice . <p> 5 Do you feel like you learned anything about marriage from any of the other couples ? Crystal : Definitely .

" <p> MARRIAGE STATSNotable : Esther Boykin is a Licensed Marriage &amp; Family Therapist , wife and mother . She has been working as a private practitioner in Northern Virginia for roughly a decade . Through her work Boykin recognized that love requires the couple 's attentionand it does n't have to feel like you 're working at itwhich is why she wrote her first book , The Date Deck , a collection of relationship repairs disguised as romance , passion , and play . <p> 1 In the book you tell a story right up front about your husband asking you why you 're so obsessed , and talk so much about , date nights . Other marriage experts extol the virtues of date night , but you wrote a book on it . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book on date nights ? <p> For me , date night epitomizes the easy simple things couples could be doing to stay connected , to improve communication , to have intimacy , and just generally have better relationships . It 's so easy to go out and date . And I know there 's lots of things that get in the way and we can talk about that , but for me , that was the underlying piece of the book . You can Google date night ideas all day long and come up with things . I really wanted couples to have not just an idea of what to do for their dates , but why date night actually helps your relationship . That was really the core of my husband 's question . <p> 2 How often do you and your husband got on dates ? <p> Sometimes we 're great and other times we 'll hit a slump . I will say it goes back and forth , and for me I like broadening the definition of date night . <p> I do a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband works from home as well , and we 'll get lunch in the middle of the day because we both happen to be at home . Sometimes I have an evening where I 'm not seeing clients and he 's got a meeting someplace fun and I 'll go . So he 'll do his meeting and afterwards we 'll hang out . <p> 3 Now in your book " The Date Deck , " you have date ideas broken out into very specific categories , such as Quicky or Budget-Friendly , is their a favorite category for you ? <p> I think my favorite category would probably be the Essential Dates , which sounds super boring . <p> I totally do these all the time , which I suppose is what makes them essential . <p> Exactly . For me , dinner and a movie is always easy , but it 's also always fun . A lot of people are surprised by my taste in movies which veers toward the average teenage boy . Not a lot of intellectual movies on my roster , but my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's movies . <p> Now the secret of that , do you set aside a little bit of time to talk about the movie or to make some sort of connection ? I know a lot of people will say that dinner and a movie is not a good date idea because you'reparticularly the movie partstuck in a room that 's dark and silent for two hours and there 's no real connection happening there . <p> I absolutely get that . I have two takes on the movie thing . The first being , it 's not a terrible date to be stuck in a dark room sitting next to each other . I mean , you can make the most of that . Some snuggling and cuddling and whatever else . The other part is that we do talk about movies . We talk during the movie , which does n't always work well in the movie theater , but we do talk about the movie afterward . There is a really interesting study that just came out of the University of Rochester where they had couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couples were doing , I would say , traditional couple 's relationship building skills , communication skills or working on emotional achievement . And then they had a group that , every week , they watched a movie ; and they had specific questions they were supposed to discuss afterward . What they found was the couples who went to watch the movie had lowered the divorce rate just as much as a couple that had done the more traditional couple skill building activities . Simply watching a movie and talking about it and thinking about the relationship issues was enough to have a real impact . <p> 4 Each date in your book includes a quick review of the date . Why did you include that part ? <p> I was thinking , similar to that study , part of what helps people get the most out of an activity is being prompted to think about it . Sometimes I 'll talk about bad habits in relationships and I think the longer people have been together the easier it is to become really mindless ; and so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are not really reaping the benefits of those dates because it 's just something on their to-do list . <p> 5 Some of the dates in the book also include the participation of kids , such as doing something artistic . If you were to put a ratio on the importance of dates with versus without kids , how often should you have dates without the kids involvement ? <p> I think the majority of dates need to not include kids . The real goal is about strengthening the couple relationship and making that a priority . It 's something that couples struggle with , couples who especially have younger kids . Not to call out my other moms because we struggle--more so than dads do--with really understanding and prioritizing the marriage as couple first is actually vital to the parenting you 're able to do . Part of making children a priority in your life , and parenting a priority , is understanding that it matters whether or not you feel close and connected to each other as a couple . And so I think the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you 've got two , three , four or maybe even one little kid and do not have access to family or babysitters , that becomes a barrier to doing things . So I did want to make sure there were some dates in there where you can include your kids if you needed to . <p> 6 Some dates throw in some romantic options . In fact you have an entire section on romantic date ideas . Do you think sex or physical intimacy are important for a date to be successful ? <p> I do n't . I think a successful date is likely to instigate some physical intimacy at some point , not necessarily at the end of the date . So if you have a great date on Tuesday , the likelihood is that it can have an impact on what happened over the course of the rest of your week . So I do n't think it 's crucial to the date itself . <p> I think particularly for couples who are maybe struggling and there 's a lot of tension or bickering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of physical intimacy is a nice transition to slowly building yourselves back up to that place where you want to be close , you want to be physically intimate , you want to have a sexual relationship with one anotherand so having that balance and being honest about where you are in a relationship is really important . <p> 7 You also have an idea about doing a spontaneous date . You mention skipping other engagements , such as going to the gym or perhaps a dentist appointment to go on that date . Since we prioritize what 's important to us with our time , where would you rank the importance of date nights to your other daily things going on in your life ? <p> Personally , I would put it at the top . I think one of the challenges for a lot of couples is that cognitively we say that our relationship is the most important thing in our lives , but where we spend our time and energy does n't really reflect that . That 's part of what I wanted to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the grand scheme of life you 're not going to look back when you 're 85 and go , " I wish I had not missed that one dentist appointment back in 2014 . " You 're going to look back and think about the time you spent with the people that you love . Sometimes you have to cancel something that seems important in order to remind yourself and your partner that they really are number one .

@@79605209 @1105209/ <p> Our Interracial MarriageThree couples share their thoughts and experiences of being in a cross-cultural relationship.BY JESSICA Q. CHEN <p> BigStockPhoto Times are changing and so are the number of interracial marriages , which still offer unique challenges . <p> As the first son in his generation , Minh Le played a key role in his Vietnamese family lineage . So when Connecticut-born Minh told his family he planned to marry Aimee , a Jewish woman from California , and more important , a non-Vietnamese woman , he knew it would n't be good news for everyone . <p> " It was painful for my grandmother on a very visceral level , " he says . " She would always remind me that her father was second to the king of Vietnam . " In other words , it was a letdown for Minhs grandmother who hoped Minh would marry within his own race . In traditional Vietnamese culture , Minhs personal choice to marry someone he loved would be overshadowed by the sense to carry the family name . <p> Luckily , the rest of Minhs family wholeheartedly accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , interracial clashes , especially between generations , are quite common . While cross-cultural relationships in the U.S. have been around since colonialism , it was only 40 years ago , in 1967 , that the Supreme Court decision of Loving v. Virginia finally swept away all laws banning interracial marriage . Since then , the number of interracial marriages have steadily increased , from less than 2 percent of all marriages in 1970 , to nearly 8 percent in 2005 , according to American Community Survey data . <p> Michael Rosenfeld , an associate professor of sociology at Stanford University and an expert on interracial relations and the changing American family , gives another reason for thissomething he calls the , " Age of Independence . " <p> " Young adults are marrying later , traveling away to college , and are more likely to live apart from their parents when they are single , " he says . This means more exposure to different types of races , as well as parents that cant dictate whom to marry . Combine that with the changing societal views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-cultural marriages . <p> Still , that does n't  mean all problems are solved . In addition to the common issues marriages face , interracial marriages may have the added burden of lack of support from their families . Other issues , such as how to raise children with a mixed identity , picking a place where you wont be constantly stared at , and learning what to say to those who stereotype you or your spouses culture , are realities for interracial couples . <p> Take Kris and Laura Maddox , for example . After meeting in college , Kris , who is black and Native American , and Laura , who is Danish and Italian , experienced two separate occasions where a black woman approached Kris just as Laura was walking away . <p> " One woman came up to me and asked me out , " Kris says . " I told her I was with someone , and she said , Oh , are you dating that white girl ? What 's up with that ? " <p> In another case , one of Lauras former mentors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to be violent . " It made me upset , " Kris says . " They told Laura in the be careful type of manner . That could be the stereotype , but that 's not the way I am . " <p> Sometimes , misunderstandings derive from true cultural differences . As a full-time pastor who met his Korean wife , Sungshim , in seminary school , John Loppnow says he s learned one of their biggest differences is direct versus indirect communication . <p> " I come from a family that values and requires us to ask for what we need . Sungshim comes from a family that you had to know or guess what the other needed . " <p> This creates a lot of confusion and guesswork on both parts . Gender roles are also deeply-engrained and differ between Eastern and Western cultures . While Western culture values independence , traditional Korean culture places the role of a woman in the home . Instead , John says a womans role is something he believes they can develop together . " I see our roles more based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . <p> Ultimately , the ability to add another layer to a relationship also allows two people of different cultures to bond on a deeper level . In fact , most interracial couples would agree that they 've found joy not only in their enriched family backgrounds , but also in understanding their own backgrounds betterits the journey of learning more about the other , not the destination . <p> " This is a dimension of our lives that will be there forever , " Aimee says , " and we are committed to figuring it out , day-by-day , little-by-little.

But a large portion of parents do not keep college savings separate , leaving money earmarked for education vulnerable to emergencies or luxuries . <p> Since Fidelity started measuring college savings rates in 2007 , the number of families who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 58 percent to 72 percent today . But among those who are saving now , only 42 percent use a dedicated savings account , such as a 529 plan . <p> The reasons for co-mingling savings ranged from simply preferring it that way to confusion about account types to apathy about getting started . <p> Take one of financial adviser Levi Brandriss ' clients from Bethesda , Maryland , who kept the money stashed for college in a savings account , intending to roll it into a 529 plan . The clients stalled because they were concerned about what would happen to the funds if their child did not go to college , or did not need all that they had saved . <p> In the meantime , they decided to use that money to buy a vacation property . <p> Vickie Adams , a financial adviser who specializes in divorce issues in Manhattan Beach , California , has had many clients with nebulous chunks of money that were originally supposed to go toward college funds . She said that money always gets divided up and used to pay legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a 529 plan , nobody ever thinks of invading that , they are sacrosanct , " said Adams . <p> In 24 years of practice , she has only had one case where a parent went into a dedicated college fund and took out money , and that was a spouse who also committed tax fraud . <p> Alternative Investing <p> Not everyone who shies away from 529 plans and other educational savings plans is doing so out of financial ineptitude . <p> Some college savers prefer to have more sophisticated investing options than are available in most state 529 plans . Some are seeking lower fees . Some do not want to be locked into only spending the funds on educational expenses . Some eschew the volatility of the stock market . <p> One choice for these investors is to consider a Roth IRA as part of their college saving strategy . Contributions can be withdrawn penalty-free after five years , while the growth stays in and continues to build tax-free . <p> But this is risky for parents if the Roth is part of their own retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow for retirement , but you can borrow for college , " said Keith Bernhardt , Fidelity 's vice president of retirement and college products . <p> In states like Texas with no income tax , Swanburg 's clients often look beyond 529 plans .

But to make the strategy work , he suggests minimum investments of around $15,000 when a child is born . <p> " It 's not the solution for everyone . This is for where a person says ' I hate volatility and I do n't want to pay tax and I want to remain flexible , ' " Swanburg said . <p> On the opposite end of the spectrum , Stephanie Sadural Heincker supplements her 529 plan with a walled-off savings account tied to an app called Qapital , which rounds up change from her debit card transactions .

They are the soul of a flavor-based cuisine " <p> ( ZESTER DAILY ) - Indian cooking gets a bad reputation for being daunting and almost too difficult to fit into your everyday repertoire . This misconception may be gradually changing , but not quite fast enough . But on the contrary , everyday Indian cooking is flavorful , practical and filled with all the health benefits from spices that we all want to incorporate into our lives . <p> A core component of the essential taste of Indian food is ensuring the flavors are fresh and bright and not bogged down by unnecessary reheating and refreshing , something often the trademark of the average restaurant fare . In addition to emphasizing the simplicity of preparation , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily found ingredients , minimizing the need for multiple visits to various grocery stores . <p> The key to Indian food is in the spices ! <p> If you are intimidated by Indian spices , a fair number of the typical seasonings are available in a well-stocked grocery store , and the rest can be kept stocked by an annual or every-six-months trip to an Indian specialty store . Shortcuts and practical cooking are not uncommon in the Indian home kitchen ; after all , the Indian home cook is as time-strapped as anyone else . <p> Stocking a basic spice pantry can go a long way toward cooking your favorite Indian meals on short notice . The basics for me would be the essential Indian spice kit from my " Spices &amp; Seasons : Simple , Sustainable Indian Flavors " cookbook : turmeric ( sold in powdered form ) , red cayenne pepper , whole cumin seeds , whole coriander seeds , fresh cilantro , ginger and garlic . <p> To add to the basics , you can include dried fenugreek leaves , green cardamoms , cinnamon , cloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curry leaves . Its nothing terribly daunting if you give the list a fighting chance and open your horizons to a world of Indian flavors . <p> A note of advice and caution : While we can simplify the list of ingredients , it is important to use fresh spices . They are the soul of a flavor-based cuisine and can not be substituted using a jar of ready-made curry , something that really is a misfit in most Indian kitchens . <p> The next step beyond stocking the spices is learning to use them . I personally use spices to create the foods of my childhood : simple , nourishing flavors that have sustained me every day . However , through teaching people how to cook Indian food , I have learned most people rush to the kitchen to replicate the flavors that have tantalized their taste buds in the last festive meal they savored . This is sometimes their first blush with the cuisine and often what captivates their imagination and what they want to re-create in their own kitchen . <p> Keeping this in mind , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions for a few others . In these dishes , I have simplified the cooking techniques and used everyday ingredients to conjure up practical variations of dishes that will take you to three diverse parts of India . <p> Creamy , Well-Seasoned Black Beans <p> This recipe for black beans is inspired by the classic Indian black lentil recipe , found in restaurants called Dal Makhani . Other than using everyday black beans , I have lightened the recipe significantly and developed it for a slow cooker , where it happily cooks into perfection . If you do not have a slow cooker , you can do this on the stove top in a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid . <p> Prep time : 2 to 3 hours ( to soak the beans ) <p> Cook time : 4 hours in a slow cooker <p> Total time : About 7 hours , mostly unattended . <p> Yield : Makes 8 servings <p> Ingredients : <p> 1 1/2 cups dried black beans <p> 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil <p> 1 tablespoon minced garlic ( about 4 cloves ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finely diced <p> 1 tablespoon freshly ground cumin <p> 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground coriander <p> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt , or to taste <p> 1 teaspoon red cayenne powder , or to taste <p> 4 tomatoes , diced , or 1 cup canned chopped tomatoes <p> 1 tablespoon dried fenugreek leaves ( optional ) <p> 3 tablespoons sour cream <p> 2 to 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro <p> Diced or sliced red onions for serving <p> Directions : <p> 1 . Place the black beans in plenty of water and soak for 2 to 3 hours or overnight . Drain and set aside . <p> 2 . If your slow cooker has a saute function , turn it on and add the olive oil . Otherwise , you can do this in a skillet on the stove . <p> 3 . Add in the onions and cook for about 5 minutes , add in the ginger and the garlic and saute until the onions are soft and golden . <p> 4 . Add in the cumin , coriander , salt and red cayenne pepper and cook for a minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 more minutes . If using a skillet , move the mixture to the slow cooker . Once the tomatoes are soft and pulpy , add this mixture to the slow cooker , add in the black beans with 3 cups of water and cook on low for 4 hours . <p> 6 . Remove the cover and stir in the fenugreek leaves , sour cream and cilantro before serving . <p> Note : You do want a fairly thick gravy for this dish . If your sauce is too thin , move to the stove top and thicken for about a half hour before adding in the sour cream . <p> Bengali Yogurt Fish Curry ( Doi Maach ) <p> This signature fish curry is often a wedding dish , a beautiful meal reminiscent of a korma ( another mildly-spiced curry dish ) . The traditional version uses fish steaks deep-fried and immersed in a delicate yogurt sauce that is slow-cooked to perfection . My version uses salmon fillet , which offers a rich , dense flesh without the need for deep-frying .

Garnish with the chilies and slivered almonds and serve . <p> Kerala Chicken Stew <p> This delicate and subtly spiced stew is a signature dish on Sunday mornings , usually served with lacy and flavorful appams ( a type of pancake ) .
