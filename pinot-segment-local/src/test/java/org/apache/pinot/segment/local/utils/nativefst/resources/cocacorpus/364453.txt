The existence of ECOWAS , which I mentioned earlier , shows the political will to open up spaces . It 's based on the idea that as part of a larger economic market there will be more opportunities for everyone .

For example , with the increased role of the private sector in delivering development , there is the need for clear criteria and accountability mechanisms to apply to all types of finance , to ensure it ends up where it is needed most , for example so that people can go to school , have high quality health services and roads to participate in local markets .

All donors need to agree a timeline to meet their commitment of 0.7% of national income on development aid and to meet their additional commitment to find $100bn to tackle climate change through the Green Climate Fund . Commitments from individual countries to contribute their fair share will go a long way to building trust and filling the financing gap . <p> Meaningful follow-up <p> There is no other forum like this that gathers together all developed and developing countries on an equal footing to tackle issues of the global economic system that undermine poverty alleviation and sustainable development . At the FFD Conference we need to see a separate strong follow up mechanism that will continue to address the difficult systemic issues in the global economy . <p> Let 's hope that Thursday sounds starter gun that we are all waiting for and does n't end up as a false start . 56065 @qwx256065 56066 @qwx256066

Their entire way of life is threatened . <p> Climate change can trigger violence as well . The bed of the river Semliki , the natural border between Uganda and the Congo , is being displaced because the Rwenzori mountain 's icecap nearby is melting . This leads to a shift in the border between the two countries . And there seems to be oil in the ground beneath . So both countries will try to benefit from the change to expand the borders of their country . This could become a conflict . <p> What are you planning to do ? - <p> Albert Mashika : - We have launched a survey in order to gather information from all dioceses and then , we will organise a forum on the question .

Is climate change really a priority concern for the population ? - <p> Albert Mashika : - It absolutely should be . If we do not take into account the effects of climate change , then we are slowly heading toward some sort of silent tsunami . When consequences will show in terms of war , food crises and malnutrition , we will witness a real disaster . It is in our interest to address the question , not only in Congo but all over Africa .

Congo is on the Equator , the weather is sunny all year long . <p> In rural areas , improved stoves ' also have great potential . They consume very little wood to cook the food . The technique has proven to be effective in North and South Kivu . These stoves do n't pollute the kitchen as they give off very little smoke and are very economical . <p> The awareness on climate issues also needs to be raised in schools . Children should be involved in reforestation projects . <p> Big companies exploiting the resources need to be held responsible for their social and environmental impact .

Seems nothing new under the sun , it just keeps coming around again . <p> From Tel Aviv to Jericho , Hebron to Ashkelon , Gaza to Galilee - still seeking a different future for decent people looking to live their lives without incessant fear and vulnerability . Stories and statistics endless while the peace seems evasive. - Often this peace seems more illusion than possibility , - crisscrossing hopes and expectations from the four corners of our- world .

There is enormous frustration and difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is accessible . Its another kind of hard deliberate work , notably getting at right relationships so the search for truth , justice , liberation and reconciliation actually makes steps into other ways of being , seeing , healing , building . <p> Rooted in Catholic Social Teaching , as Caritas members are in 165 countries and well beyond , you find from faith a different way forward . Instead of merely being " for " or " against " we need to be more deeply , even objectively , " with " others , all Gods people in this land . As peace-builders we need to be real , concrete , engaging every kind of possible healthy human respectful relationship . We need get beyond the legions legacies , legends and litigious machinations .

Unless we see the " other " and imagine ourselves walking with some measure of basic trust we will not get there . Those we work to support through solidarity will not get there either . Beyond the millions and billions expended via deals , agreements and treaties the greatest courage needs to renew our sense of belonging , of being part of a common humanity .

Its an extraordinary natural resource we generally fail to rely on consistently . We must reach in as much as reach out . <p> As believers , as Caritas colleagues , we can journey from the Old Testament to the New . We can pause in the deserts where the Psalms still echo strong , leading us to Christs Gospel call . We know the questions . We recognize the wounds . We see what fear can do . We need to more carefully re-imagine what peace can do .

There is no affliction in us or this tortured land where Christ will not reconcile us . <p> This is our reality check . This is the daily ongoing deliberate hard work of lifetimes , getting moving onto paths to peace that can lead to life , that tear down mental and physical walls . It is as possible as it is difficult . It offers light from darkness if we dare go . It nurtures the common good and community if we dare not go alone .
