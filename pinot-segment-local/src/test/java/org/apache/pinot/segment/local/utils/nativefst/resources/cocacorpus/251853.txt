There 's the convenience of ordering from your couch ( in your PJs if you 'd like ) , the time you save by not having to walk or drive from store to store , and the sheer number of brands and styles you can explore with just the click of button . But there is one major disadvantage : not being able to try something on and know it will fit you until it arrives in the mail . After all , what might be a medium in one store could be a small in another and even a large in yet another . <p> Fortunately for you , the fix is pretty simple : knowing your measurements to figure out your size in everything from dresses- and jackets to fitness leggings and even intimates .

Each inch of difference between those two numbers is a cup size ( i.e. if the difference is 2 inches , you 're a B cup ; if it 's 4 inches , you 're a D cup ) . <p> And if you have n't already guessed , figuring out your bra size is as simple as combining the number of your bust measurement ( 34 , for example ) with your cup size . <p> To Measure Your Waist <p> Keeping your arms and body relaxed , slip the measuring tape around the smallest part of your waist .

You pull your favorite compression leggings out of the wash only to find that they 've become impossibly snagged in the zipper of your skinny jeans or perhaps they 've acquired the stench of a thousand pounds of sauerkraut . The reality is that incorrect washing can destroy or significantly shorten the life of your workout gear . But do n't throw in the towel just yet ; we 're here to show you the way . Let 's get down to the nitty-gritty <p> DO : Air out <p> Do n't let your clothing sit in a sweaty bundle . You 're virtually rolling out the welcome mat for mold and mildew . Hang items to dry instead of leaving them in your gym bag or tossing them in your hamper . Since most fitness fabrics are non-absorbent to begin with , they 'll dry in a snap . <p> DO : Wash cold <p> This may seem counterintuitive , but washing in cold water is a must . ( The care label of nearly any workout garment will back this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakdown of highly elastic fabrics . <p> DO N'T : Wash with abrasive garments <p> Mesh and cut-outs are having a big moment right now , and those on-trend details require extra TLC .

( Bonus : They 're ideal for keeping regular bras , sweaters , and embellished clothing safe too . ) <p> DO : Wash inside out <p> Sweat , bacteria , and natural body oils accumulate on the inside of the fabric , so flipping your items before washing is key . This ensures your washing machine can get straight to work on the dirtiest bits .

It can mean the difference between feeling like a million bucks or feeling like a swamp creature at the gym . Fabric softener clogs up the fibers of your fitness garments , leaving a coating that prevents them from truly getting clean . It also blocks the moisture-wicking capabilities of technical fabrics . The same goes for dryer sheets " just say no . <p> DO : Use white vinegar to eliminate odors <p> If things have gotten a little out of hand on the funk front , there are plenty of effective odor eliminating products available , but we prefer to keep things simple and all-natural with white vinegar . When needed , add half a cup to the softener compartment , so clothes will get a clarifying rinse after the wash cycle .

However , at the beginning of this month I did n't know that my shipment had arrived until I saw a charge on my credit card for $287.38 from wantable . When I asked my husband if he had seen my box he realized he had forgotten to give it to me . I promptly opened it up , decided I would return the entire box and promptly returned the contents . I called the customer service number and they said as soon as they received the clothes back I would receive a refund .

Three days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationalized that the shipment must have gone out right before I put my account on hold . I returned everything the next day .

This was my second subscription box , I also get a box from stitchfix . Stitchfix has always given me at least 7 days , from when I receive a box , to charge my card . When I have put my account on hold , they have honored my request and not sent anything until I turn the delivery schedule back on . This was outright fraud . I am going to have to file a claim with my bank to get my money back .

My problem is that the clothes are WAY to highly priced . Some of the brands are worth the buck , but others like t-shirts are not . I 've searched the brands and they charge basically retail , range of $40-100 for each item . The pants tend to average around $80 , and I 'm not okay with paying that unless they are my designer favorite Rock N Republic . I 'll be canceling my subscription today . It 's just not economical and I 've only like three items that I felt were worth the money.See More <p> I received my intimates box today .

T ... hey will not prove match " discounted sites " though . I actually liked some of the pieces though so basically I am out my $20 but at least I know what I liked and what size I needed so I went and purchased them on the other sites .

So this leads me to believe they are selling old unsold merchandise . Still , not a big deal but interesting to note . You can also find the same brands and same exact items at the manufacturers website or another website far cheaper . After the first edit they billed me for the fee for the next edit . Three weeks later still no shipment . I just keep getting emails saying my order is delayed . They sure did n't mind charging me quickly though .

Good thing I 'm wearing a long top so I could finish my day at work . It is a easy fix for me to stitch up and I will do so as I want to keep the pants .

Having said that , both orders I received were not customized or personalized to my individual style despite their detailed questionnaire and my comments to the stylist about what I 'd like to receive . Even the note I received in my order from the stylist seemed generic like they did n't pick-out the items or know which ones I was receiving . Unlike other commenters who said they get better with time , I do n't feel like wasting $20 every month on the chance that they might get it right one day . I 'm going to stick with StitchFix instead.See More <p> Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can they smack an imaginary price on a pair of jeans and it be okay ?

I did receive things in the beginning that was n't for me ... fit or quality or style . BUT ... After they have gotten to know what I like ... I have kept more and more of the items .

Were talking wool sweaters , insanely soft cashmere , and leather everything , just to name a few . <p> But now that its time to start wearing these cool-weather fabrics and styles , is n't it time to start caring for them the right way , too ? If you plan to wear them again next season ( and for many seasons to come ) , then the answer should definitely be " yes . " And just in case you have no idea where to start , we created this handy little guide to washing , wearing , and storing your favorite fall fabrics . <p> Cashmere <p> How to Wash It : - Since the luxurious fabric is so delicate ( and pricy ) , wash your cashmere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do need to wash it , simply fill a clean sink or tub with lukewarm water and a gentle shampoo , such as baby shampoo . After softly washing and rinsing to remove bubbles , press out excess water using a towel , then lay the garment flat to dry on a clean towel or surface . Avoid wringing wet cashmere , as it can damage the fibers and cause it to lose shape . <p> How to Remove Wrinkles : Turn the garment inside out , then lay a damp towel on top . Iron on the lowest setting , or use a handheld steamer to remove wrinkles , smoothing the fabric with your hands as you go . <p> How to Store It : - For the short term , fold cashmere " never hang it " using tissue paper to help absorb any moisture . To store in the off-season , keep your cashmere in a cool , dry space away from sources of heat or sunlight . Add mothballs to your storage area to keep moths from damaging the fabric . <p> Leather <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply dab or wipe leather with a cool , damp cloth to remove dirt , being- careful not to rub too hard and scuff the fabric . Need a deeper clean ? Submerge- your jacket , pants , dress , or other leather item in warm water until saturated , then tumble dry on high heat . Tip : Washing and drying leather can actually give it a well-worn , vintage look and help break in a shiny , stiff item . <p> How to Remove Wrinkles : For minor wrinkles , steam leather using a handheld steamer . For deeper creases , set your iron to warm , - lay a cotton or linen towel atop the item , then gently press the leather with your iron for a few seconds to soften the appearance of- wrinkles . <p> How to Wash It : - Toss synthetic faux furs into the washer using the delicate cycle , cold water , a mild detergent , and- no- fabric softener ( it can break down the fibers in faux fur ) . Hang the garment to air dry , then shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your piece is synthetic ? Just take it to the dry cleaner to have it professionally cleaned . <p> How to Care For It : - Remove any trapped odors using a handheld steamer , and use a soft-bristled brush once a week to remove knots , matting , and any dirt or particles . <p> How to Store It : - One rule : Keep it in a clean , dry space . ( That was simple , right ? ) <p> Silk <p> How to Wash It : - Because silk is prone to absorbing- dirt and oils , wash your silk pieces immediately after wearing them by hand-washing in cold water using delicate , oil-free soap . Use a towel to dab or press out excess water , then hang to let air dry . <p> How to Remove Wrinkles : - Steam from a handheld steamer is powerful enough to remove even the deepest wrinkles in this luxe fabric . <p> How to Store It : - Avoid folding and storing silk in a drawer ; hang it in a cool , dry place instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Add a few squirts of gentle wool cleaner to tepid water in a spotless tub or sink ; avoid warm or hot water , as they can cause wool to shrink . Turn the garment inside out , then submerge in water and let soak for about 10 minutes . Rinse with cool water , then press out moisture with a clean towel . Reshape the item and lay flat on a towel to dry . <p> How to Remove Wrinkles : - Use a handheld steamer to remove wrinkles , and allow the garment to air dry before wearing . <p> How to Store It : - Fold and store wool in an airtight container in a cool , dry place . Never hang wool , as this can cause the heavy fabric to stretch and change shapes .

A silky blouse , statement earrings , and suede pumps keep them extra festive , while a tailored blazer and flats make the style office-appropriate , too . <p> Plaid <p> This long-loved pattern is a classic for a reason : Whether it 's on a slightly oversized button-down or the lining of your favorite winter coat , it 's a timeless print that has winter written all over it .

Simply choose a top or sweater with a keyhole cutout to get the choker effect in an effortless- way . <p> Bomber jackets <p> Though they may not be warm enough to wear on their own , bomber jackets are a great layer to work into your wardrobe for some sporty-chic edge .

We understand that although they look amazing , the process of getting them applied comes with a lot of questions and concerns . To help ease your mind , Neroli Salon &amp; Spa Esthetician , Elise , is going to share her most frequently asked questions , and the answers that will ease your mind . After the Q&amp;A we 've listed some false lashes application tips &amp; tricks that will make you a lash master in no time at all . <p> LASH EXTENSION Q&amp;A <p> What is the difference between lash extension application and false lash application ? Lash extensions are bonded 1 natural lash to 1 lash extension . Each individual lash is separate . In a false lash application either a full band is applied directly on top of the lash line or cluster false lashes are used . When cluster lashes are being applied , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the lash line next to each other . <p> How do you care for lash extensions ? Overall lash extensions are simple to maintain . My recommendation is brushing the lashes with a disposable mascara wand in the morning and cleansing the lash line at night before bed . It is always recommended to use the products designed for your specific lash extension brand for cleansing . At Neroli Salon &amp; Spa we use Novalash brand extensions . I always recommend the Novalash cleansing pads and Novalash mascara to ensure the longevity of your extensions . Last , avoid rubbing the eye area harshly when removing makeup , etc . <p> How often should lash fills be done ? Fills are recommended every two weeks to keep the lash line looking full at all times . Lashes do not all fall out at the same time . Everyday new lashes are gradually coming in as 1 or 2 of your natural lashes are shedding . This may vary in number person to person .

You can buy individual eyelashes or lash clusters , or you can get strips of eyelashes and cut them yourself to create individual lashes . Individual lashes and lash clusters tend to look more natural than a- full- eyelash strip . <p> Prep. - If you want your eyelashes looking glam all night , apply the lashes after all your shadow and liner . Applying mascara after the lashes are adheard ensures a cleaner and less clumpy finish . <p> Glue . Individual lashes and strip lashes use different glue. - Individual- or cluster lashes are applied directly to the lash , where the strip lashes are applied to your lid . This is very important to know because eye lids are- very sensitive . The individual lashes use a clear liquid glue and the strip lashes use a tacky white glue that dries clear . Most lashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can buy it separately at stores- more beauty stores . <p> Application .

Close your eye and attach the lash to the existing lash line , making sure the curl is following along with the- natural- curve of your lashes . The glue takes a couple minutes to dry so make any adjustments then .

But you probably have n't spent nearly as much time building an intimates collection of the same caliber . Considering how important these pieces are , however " they 're the foundation of a great wardrobe , after all " nows the time to start if you have n't already . <p> Good thing we 've put together a handy little list of the nine intimates every woman should have , including the bras , underwear , and other styles we think of as the- building blocks for the perfect collection . Just start here with the basics , then keep adding on with nice-to-have extras ( i.e. a just-for-fun bra and stockings ) to create- an even better collection over time . <p> Bras <p> 1 . T-Shirt Bra <p> This essential style should be your everyday go-to , worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , t-shirts . Look for one that 's comfortable and perfectly fitting , with just a little bit of lift and smooth cups to keep from showing through your tops . <p> 2 . Convertible Bra <p> This bra is like magic , working with everything from strapless dresses and low back tops to one-shoulder jumpsuits and anything else that has an unusual neckline " all without- having to buy five different bras . Look for one whose moveable ( and preferable removable ) - straps can be worn in as many positions as possible , such as strapless , halter , crisscross , and more . <p> 3 . Matching Bra &amp; Panty Set <p> For special occasions or when you just feel like getting matchy-matchy with your intimates , a coordinating bra and panty set is the ultimate way to look put-together underneath it all . Go for something dark and lacy to turn up the sex appeal , or stick with a set that 's brighter or patterned for a little more fun . Just want something you can wear every day ? Try a satin or cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder blue . <p> Underwear <p> <p> 1 .

Stick with a smooth material like lace or satin to keep body-hugging pants , skirts , and dresses streamlined . <p> 2 . Full-Coverage Panties <p> Even if you 're a thong-loving woman , every lady should have a pair of full-coverage underwear in her intimates drawer . Perfect for wearing under shorter dresses and skirts , this style let 's you bare your legs without worrying about baring- too much else when moving around , climbing stairs , and so on . <p> 3 . No-Show Panties <p> Not to sound dramatic , but there 's nothing worse than the dreaded VPL ( visible panty line ) .

Whether you prefer full-coverage tights or thigh-high stockings , choose a durable , opaque pair for ultimate sleekness . <p> 2. - Robe <p> Whether its for getting ready or hanging around in before bedtime , a robe is one of those easy pieces to throw on when you need to wear- something around the house , but do n't  quite want to get dressed . Try a shorter , satin version to add a dose of luxury to your everyday routine , or go with a longer , super-soft cotton style- if comfort ( and a little more coverage ) is key . <p> 3 . Nightie <p> From satin to lace , sexy to demure , every woman should own at least- one- nightie .

Well , here 's one way to make things simpler : Just pair it with a- matching red pant ( and jacketand shoes ) . <p> That 's right : The monochromatic look is back for fall and making you look better than ever . That 's because the trend has a slimming effect , since wearing- one color from head to toe makes your body look longer and leaner . And that 's not the only reason to give this trend a try : Its also an easy way to look super-chic and high fashion , plus it can often be pulled off using pieces you already have stashed away in your closet . <p> If the thought of jumping straight from a multi-hued outfit to one color from head to toe is a little overwhelming for you , take the trend slowly by picking a top and bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accessories in a different color .

You keep what you want , send back what you do n't , and a return label is provided for zero hassle . You pay a $20 styling fee , which is nonrefundable , but IS applied to your final purchase .

@@99951575 @4151575/ <p> Weddings are steeped in tradition , and these days , you can pick and choose which ones to include . Most matrimonial customs have been around for centuries and could use a little makeover . If you 're interested in modernizing your big day , take a peek at- our guide ; well share- modern traditions , including everything from the father-daughter dance to the engagement ring covered in an easy-to-follow guide . <p> The Photography <p> The history : - The tradition- of wedding photography originated in the mid-19th century not long after the invention of the camera . Those with means captured formal studio portraits wearing their best clothing , either before or after the wedding . The practice of capturing the big day itself did n't  begin until the surge in weddings post-WWII , introducing a photojournalistic element in addition to formal portraits of the couple and family . <p> The new twist : Weve come a long way since the days of single-use flashbulbs , with smartphones- putting a high-quality digital camera in the hands of every guest . Some couples are skipping the photographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspectives of their loved ones. - Many others prefer a balance of both professional and informal photography , encouraging their guests to post to social media using their one-of-a-kind wedding hashtag . With so many options now available , be sure to weigh the pros and cons , - and make the decision that 's right for you . <p> The Man-gagement Ring <p> The history : - Mankinds obsession with rings can be traced back to prehistoric times when cavemen encircled their mates waist , wrists , and ankles with braided grass as a way to mark their property . Luckily , the ancient Egyptians swept in with a more romantic approach to jewelry ; its said that they were the first to think of the ring as a symbol of endless love . And Archduke Maximillian of Austria can be credited for kicking off the diamond craze by plunking a bit of bling on his fiancees finger way back in 1182 . It took a few centuries to catch on , but now some men are now wearing engagement rings ( the correct lingo is mangagment ) , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be tight , you can breathe easy knowing mangagement rings cost far less than the sparkly showstopper you envision for- your own hand . Most guys opt for bands made of titanium or silver . Add engraving or stamping for a little flair . <p> The Rice Toss <p> The history : - The custom of the rice toss dates all the way back to ancient times and symbolizes showering the newlyweds with abundance and fertility . Oats and dried corn were also popular for pelting the couple . Its just as well that people are seeking other options since rice can be treacherous for high heeled wearing guests . <p> The new twist : - For colorful photos , go with rainbow sprinkles ( oh , how the pigeons will love you ) or pom poms . If you have the environment in mind , popcorn , lavender , and packets filled with birdseed- are all eco-friendly options . There 's even biodegradable confetti- that looks exactly like rice and dissolves once it comes in contact with water .

To avoid having their fancy frocks ripped , brides began tossing their flowers into the crowd for an easy getaway . <p> The new twist : - Theres nothing becoming about all the single ladies jostling each other out of the way to get their hands on the bouquet . A more dignified approach ? Present your flowers to your parents or a close friend to express your love . Or thrill the youngest guests at the party by launching teddy bears or candy into the air . <p> Ceremony Seating <p> The history : - Theres a mind-boggling amount of- etiquette- about- who sits where at the wedding ceremony . According to experts , step-relatives should be shown to their seats first . In Christian ceremonies , the brides guests sit on the left , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonies , the parents stand under the chuppah . Its enough to make even the most sensible ushers head spin . <p> The new twist : - Having the couples guests sit separately is an excellent way to scope out if the groom has any cute buddies , but you might as well start mingling from the get-go . Arranging mismatched vintage sofas or laying down picnic blankets and- bales of hay ensure a casual vibe . There 's also a- major trend in spiral seating arrangements- so everyone has a great view of the first kiss . Setting up a circle looks simple , but you 'll need a- plan- to get the symmetry right . <p> - The White Dress <p> The history : Many believe that brides wear white to symbolize innocence and purity , but for many years , brides were content to put on the best dress in their closet for their trip to the altar , no matter what the color . In fact , the snowy shade was often associated with mourning . It was n't until Queen Victoria stepped out in a white gown trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( her first cousin , no less ) that the craze began . Because white was still a difficult hue to produce back then , it became a status symbol . <p> The new twist : - Now you can take your pick of pastels , florals , and saturated hues . Vera Wang , the wedding gown maven herself , has everything from icy pink to dusty rose in her collection of classics . Although- anyone who has seen an episode of Say Yes to the Dress can tell you , it takes a little more effort to track a colorful gown- down . <p> The Father-Daughter Dance <p> The history : - Once upon a time , daughters were considered the property of their family . After twirling on the dance floor , fathers passed brides on to their suitors to signify their approval of the marriage . There 's a good chance that you 've been paying your own ways for years now so this rite of passage may seem outdated . There 's plenty of modern alternatives- that may seem more fitting . <p> The new twist : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of attention , invite all the fathers and daughters in attendance onto the dance floor . While you 're at it , allow sons and mothers to come up , too . Or perhaps you both have a case of two left feet . In that case , reciting a poem together can be every bit as meaningful . Reading a letter that you 've written to him gets point across , too . 
@@99951577 @4151577/ <p> See ? Makeup mishaps have happened to the best of us ! But rather than letting a mascara smear or stray eyeshadow ruin a perfectly good outfit , all you need are a few tips and tricks for getting makeup spills out of almost anything . One important thing to remember about any kind of makeup stain : Do n't throw your garment into the dryer until you 're absolutely sure the spot has come clean , since heat can set stains and make them nearly impossible to get out . <p> Now on to the specifics <p> Foundation <p> Liquid foundations can seep into fabrics quickly , so try to treat the stain as soon as possible . If foundation is caked onto the surface of your clothes , gently scrape it off using something flat , like a knife . Next , dampen a paper towel and blot the stain to try to remove additional color . Grab some hydrogen peroxide , then apply a few drops to the spot and use your fingers to massage the liquid into your clothes . Finally , use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before throwing it in the wash and laundering as usual . <p> Spilled powder instead of liquid foundation ? Combine a few drops of laundry detergent with water , then rub the mixture into the stain with your fingers first , then a toothbrush . Finish by washing the garment according to fabric instructions . And if you need a quick fix : Add a little shaving cream to the stain and let it sit for a few minutes before tossing in the washing machine . <p> Lipstick <p> After gently blotting with a clean towel or tissue to remove excess color , lightly spritz the stain with water , then add a bit of oil-fighting liquid dish soap . Softly rub the soap into the stain , and let it sit for about 15 minutes . Next , use a clean towel to rub the spot in a circular motion , then dab it dry with another clean towel . Did n't  quite do the trick ? Just give it another try , following the same steps once again . <p> Another solution : Spritz the lipstick stain with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dab it with a sponge to remove excess color and moisture , then wash the garment as usual . <p> Eyeshadow <p> Loose-powder eyeshadows may be great for creating a gorgeous look , but they can make the whole spilling-on-your-shirt thing a lot more likely . Fortunately , removing the excess shadow is pretty simple : Combine white vinegar with water , then apply a few drops to the stain . Work in the solution with a toothbrush using a circular motion , then toss your garment in the wash to finish the stain-removal process . <p> For an even quicker but just-as-effective cleanup , add a few drops of oil-free makeup remover onto a cotton ball , then dab at the stain until it disappears , being sure not to soak the garment with remover . Rinse under cold water , then let the piece- air dry . <p> Mascara <p> Dropped the mascara wand on your favorite pair of pants ?

On a personal note , both of my favorite fitness clothing stores closed in September ( yes , in THE SAME MONTH ) , and this has been filling the voidand I do n't  even have to get in the car . Before we get to my November Edit , here 's a little background on this subscription service if you 're not familiar . <p> Its- essentially a personal styling session by mail , where you receive five items to try on in the comfort of your own home and keep what you want , send back what you do n't ( return label is provided ) . You pay a $20 styling fee , which is nonrefundable but IS applied to your final purchase . If you keep all five items ( which is likely ) , you receive an additional 20% off . <p> But how do they select clothing just for you ? Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but brief ) survey where you provide your sizes and answer questions regarding the types of items you 'd like to receive ( sports bras , shorts , pants , tanks , hoodies , etc. ) , activities you do , and even the colors you prefer . A rating system of dislike , like , and love keeps it easy , and you also select the price ranges you prefer . <p> With further ado , let 's check out my November Fitness Edit.Shape Active Printed Legging Ribbon Print ( $68 ) I was honestly a little surprised to see two pairs of wild printed leggings in my box as I selected neutrals as my preference in the survey . But I can still appreciate my stylist taking risks . These fit perfectly , but they just werent that flattering and I did n't  want my legs to look like an 80s rave , so I sent them back . <p> Human Performance Engineering Snakeskin Leggings ( $54 ) Now these on the other hand , I could n't turn down . They definitely did n't  minimize my thighs like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the print and edgy mesh cutouts . They are very comfortable and the fit was spot-on . I kept them . <p> Prismsport Loose Tank in Lime ( $48 ) Eh , was n't crazy about the color or the fit .

I love the snug fit and built-in bra ; its perfect for low-impact exercise ( not enough support for running though ) . And Ive actually been traveling in them ( with a hoodie over it , of course ) because they are comfortable and I can nix wearing a bra . Definitely kept this one . <p> BLS Payton Jacket ( $108 ) I had been waiting for a jacket/hoodie in my Edit ( literally , I said it in this review ) and finally received one ! I really like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattering and the peplum style makes it unique . I will definitely be wearing this to and from workout classes through the chilly months . <p> Overall , I was happy with this Edit .

I tested out Wantable 's Fitness Edit last month and was very impressed a box full of fitness clothing handpicked for me so I do n't have to leave the house and brave the elements AND terrifying 3-way mirrors at stores ? No-brainer . I kept three of the five items last month , so I was excited to see what they sent me this monthand just maybe I 'd want to keep all five ! Read on to see if they delivered . But before the review , here 's how it works : This is essentially a personal styling session by mail , where you receive five items you can try on in the comfort of your own home and keep what you want , send back what you do n't ( return label is provided to make it easy ) . You pay a $20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your final purchase . You receive an additional 20% off when you keep all 5 items.And you may be wondering : How do they select clothing just for me ?

You also select the price ranges ; for example , I 'll never receive a $70 tank that I 'll be tempted to keep ( thank goodness ) . <p> Pants are always tricky will they be tight enough but also comfortable and make my butt look good while not giving me camel toe or muffin top ? The pressure ! But I was pleased with these ! They did n't feel exactly like a second skin , but they fit well enough and the leopard print with mesh and cutout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class when I want to look extra sassy . I 'm keeping them . <p> Colosseum Cutout Body Hug Tank ( $59 ) <p> This tank is a little pricey but I really love it . The gray color is perfect to mix up a mostly black workout wardrobe and the deep cutout in the back is unique and edgy . <p> Glyder Cross Your Heart Wrap Tank ( $58 ) <p> Again , on the pricier end for a tank but you can tell the quality is high . This tank has a built-in bra with medium support so I would n't run in it , but it 's great for a barre or yoga class . The double straps add some extra style points . Keeping it ! <p> Cory Vines The Lane Track Short ( $42 ) <p> I could tell this was a great short breathable , lightweight , comfortable waistband , and a key pocket .

But this short did n't  fit me that well anyway ( a little too snug ) , so the seem issue was n't a big deal . <p> Glyder Vintage Vinyasa Bralette ( $54 ) <p> I LOVE this bra ! I have never owned a sports bra with this retro-inspired look and sexy silhouette . I love the longer under-bust band and v-neck . It fit so well and will be perfect for low-impact workouts ( or lounging around the house in front of the boyfriend , wink wink ) . <p> And now , time for a selfieOverall , I was impressed with this Edit and think they did a great job of choosing items for me . Even though I got a defective item , they were quick to respond and try to rectify the issue . Ca n't wait to see what I get for November ( fingers crossed for a hoodie ) .

In the past , I definitely did n't wash my makeup brushes regularly ( or ever ) , but then I read that horrific article about the woman who was paralyzed by a dirty makeup brush ( granted she was sharing with a friend ) , plus I had the general realization that brushing bacteria onto my face was n't such a great idea and I should probably prevent that as much as possible . So here we are . Let me answer your burning questions about this issue and make it as easy as possible to stay on top of cosmetic cleansing.Do I really need to ? I mean , no . But do you REALLY have to do anything ? Chances are you wo n't lose any limbs using dirty brushes , but you may be more prone to breakouts , inflammation and aging . Why aging , you ask ? As a rule , anything that 's bad for your skin ages you , that 's why . Also , the dirtier the bristles , the harder they get and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular maintenance makes them last longer . How often should you wash your makeup brushes ? Some people say daily . Those people are certifiably crazy . Some people say weekly . - The rule- is once a month , but if you 're giving your brushes a good cleaning once a quarter ( and not sharing with anyone ) , you 're doing better than most of the world . What 's the quickest , easiest way to do it ? The quick and ( not ) dirty way is to purchase a spray brush cleaner . Some cleaners instruct you to spray directly on the bristles and others encourage spraying on a cloth and rubbing your brush over it . Then hang upside down or lay flat to dry . These work great for regular sanitizing , but the experts say you should still give brushes a more thorough cleaning ( ie. soak the bristles entirely ) annually . And of course , if you find the spray cleaner quick and easy to use , go for weekly cleanings !

First , run your brushes under lukewarm water ( tip from Lauren Conrad : Try to focus on the actual bristles while avoiding the part of the brush where handle meets the head , as this can loosen the glue over time ) . Swirl your brushes in a bowl of lukewarm water and dollop of shampoo . If you like extra lather , you can swirl the brush in your palm . Rinse brush under water until it runs clear . Use the cloth to gently remove excess moisture and reshape the bristles . Lay your brushes on a clean cloth to dry ( or hang upside down if you 're that crafty ) . You may need to make a fresh water/shampoo bowl for each brush if they 're really dirty . How will you know ? Do n't  worry , - you 'll be able to tell

As someone who has coveted those little red-soled shoes , I jumped at the opportunity to shell out for a bottle . <p> When it arrived on my doorstep this week I could hardly contain my excitement . Given how quickly Rouge Louboutin sold out , the exclusivity of this experience doubled my anticipation .

Rouge Louboutin does not disappoint on either front . The formula is nearly opaque in one coat , but a second deepens the color to Louboutins signature red . It applies very well without streaks or bubbles , though my recent Shellac-induced nail damage needed a top coat to smooth things out to perfection . My favorite part is that Rouge Louboutin dries down very quickly and has a glossy finish that emulates the sheen of the ebony brush handle ( See below for my Rouge Louboutin swatch ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for a few days now , but it passed my hair washing test which has defeated many a lacquer . <p> In addition to the A+ formula , the color is simply stunning .

Can you find a similar shade- sans the $50 price tag ? Of course , but there 's no replacement for the experience that comes along with Louboutins magnificent Rouge Louboutin lacquer . If you 're craving the luxury of Louboutin but do n't  want to sell a kidney to pay for a pair of pumps , Rouge Louboutin is a beautiful compromise .
