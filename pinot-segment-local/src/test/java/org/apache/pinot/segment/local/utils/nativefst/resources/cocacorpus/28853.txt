By the end of the decade , the program reached upwards of 2,800 Cadets . After congress passed the 1964 Vitalization Act , the program was changed to support a general military science education , allowing Cadets to choose from any Army branch upon commissioning . Northeastern Army ROTC was opened to women at the start of the school year in 1973 . The current Chairman of Northeasterns Board of Trustees , Mr. Neil Finnegan , is himself a 1961 graduate of the ROTC program . <p> During the 1960s , as the nations involvement in the Vietnam conflict escalated , calls to support or expel Army ROTC from Northeastern increased drastically .

Military drill was compulsory for allable-bodied male students , and it was mandatory to wear a prescribed uniform . The Board of Trustees ordered the regulations of the United States Military Academy to serve as a basis for discipline at the College .

Smoke , Cadet Command in 1894 , the college began the practice of sending the cadets to a one-week camp away from the campus .

The problem is , my recruiter and the commanding recruiter refuse to follow the regulation and to drop me from the delayed entry program upon my request . These are their words : <p> They told me I cant join other military branches because I have a medical waiver for my eczema . <p> They told me that I can not leave the delayed entry program because I swear and signed the contract . They lied , because under DoD Directive 1332.14 ( Page 17 ) it states that " A person who is in the Delayed Entry Program may be separated upon his or her request when authorized by the Secretary concerned " also under MCO P1100.72C it states that " If the interview and counseling session fails , and the individual insists on being released from the enlistment , the individual will be discharged as soon as possible " . <p> The commanding recruiter told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharge me because my reasons for leaving the delayed entry program is not valid . This is a lie , because my reasons are within the guidelines . My reasons are , I refuse to wait another 11 more months prior to be ship off to boot-camp because of hardship , I am no longer interested in joining the Marine Corp , I wish to join the U.S. Army , I 've been accepted in my local community college . <p> The commanding recruiter started making things up such as telling me , I told them earlier that , I am willing to take any job and sign for an open-contract which I never say , because I made it clear from the start that I wanted to be an infantry . <p> The commanding recruiter told me that he will still keep me in the delayed entry program until my contract is expired and that it is up to me whether I would go to boot-camp or not . Again this violates DoD Directive 1332.14 and MCO P1100.72C . <p> Lastly , After interviewing me on the phone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delayed entry program , he still refuses to discharged me , which violates MCO P1100.72C ( Page 273-274 ) which state that " If the interview and counseling session fails and the individual insists on being released from the enlistment , the individual will be discharged as soon as possible " . <p> I already fill up the assistance form with the commanding inspector and currently awaiting the result . What is my other option if this fail ? I also contacted my local congressional office but the people at the military section refuses to help me saying that the contract I signed is legally binding even after I told them that I have legal grounds under DoD Directive 1332.14 and MCO P1100.72C . <p> Technically they 're right . The contract you signed is legally binding , regardless of regulation . Legally , you could be arrested for refusing to ship . None of that will happen of course . It has n't since we went to an all-volunteer force . <p> Just because the Corps granted your waiver does n't mean the Army will . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd then face the decision of going back to the Marines and trying to get them to reprocess you . <p> Have you found an Army recruiter to work with you ? Many are highly reticent to work with a DEP loss . How do they know you wo n't change your mind again ? <p> You 'll just have to keep pushing . They 're not going to force you to ship or take any legal action . <p> They can actually hold you longer than 365 days ... so , you are at their mercy . You enlisted with them and they do not have to process your request immediately . <p> 1 ) I have never seen anyone get an eczema waiver in the Army . AR 40-501 lists it as being disqualifying . You might think twice about trying to switch . You may end up not being able to serve anywhere . There is a great chance that you will not get a waiver in the Army and then you will have likely blown it with the Marines as well . <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires admin processing . It is lower on the priority list than other processing . It can take a while . I have heard of many being held beyond one year because of it . <p> 3 ) As I stated in #1 , it looks to me as though you would be leaving the USMC for Community College . If waiting until your shipdate is an issue , you could be trying to work with them to move your shipdate up . <p> 4 ) That 's all conjecture . The fact is ... you enlisted with the Marines . They do not guarantee specific MOSs , only career fields . If it is not explicitly spelled out in your contract from MEPS . It would list your PEF as HH or HJ . ( HZ if you went Recon ) . If it does not say that , you signed a different contract at MEPS . <p> 5 ) Actually , this does not violate it . There are other reasons that permit them to hold you . <p> 6 ) See #2 . They can also hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You are confusing DODI and MCOs with legally binding documents . These are instructions and regulations and not legal documents . They can actually hold you through 365 after you enlist and even a little longer if they have a reason to do so . Many get cold feet and then change their mind . Your congressional liaison is correct , your contract is legally binding and the other regulations and policy due not supersede it . The IG may try to work something different , but if the commander is within his authority and regulations , it is likely that they will take no action . <p> In all honesty , right now you really need to evaluate what is more important : serving or not serving . Eczema is not something that I have seen waived for anyone . I have seen many be completely disqualified for this . The chances of you getting a waiver in the Army are extremely low ... if it can even be submitted . IAW AR 40-501 , Chapter 2 ... this seems non-waiverable . So , you could get released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... and you are likely going to end up remaining in the civilian world . If you actually want to serve , it may behoove you to stay with the Marines and just try to move your shipdate up if you are experiencing hardship by waiting . You are risking it all if released.I am telling you right now ... it will be HARD , if not impossible , to get a waiver for eczema . <p> I do n't know if the U.S. Army recruiter I talked in the past is telling the truth or not , but he told me that eczema is not a disqualifying condition for the U.S. Army . With that said I will take my chances and if the military is not really for me then I would go to school . <p> 2 . " As soon as possible is subjective " No it 's not . Its clearly written on the regulation that you should be dropped as soon as possible and no later than the 10th of next month . Also if people are being held for more than a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misconduct . Because obviously they are deliberately stalling the seperation of request . <p> 4 . Conjecture or not my commanding recruiter is using dishonesty and intimidation to try and keep me in and force me to sign an open contract to be ship out sooner to prevent me from leaving . No . The Marine Corp can guarantee you a job as long as its written in the contract . They have however the power to change depending on the need of the Marine Corp , but most people still get their desired job . <p> 5 . Yes , it does . Why even bother putting a regulation if were not going to abide by it ? One of the Inspector General responsibilities is to invetigate recruiter 's misconduct and or violations of recruiting regulation and policies . Can you also please list all the reasons you believe will permit them to hold me ? <p> 6 . They can only hold someone in dep if it is approved and if the enlisted agreed to the terms . Otherwise the contract will expired and individual will be released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the case if your planning to be seperated from the delayed entry program . <p> DoD and MCO are not instructions . They are laws that have to be regulated . Try and break them and see where you gon na find yourself in . <p> You have to realize ( saying this in the nicest way possible ) you technically belong to the USMC for now . The previous two told you the reg on Army and eczema . They told you how the marines can keep you . Your feelings on if it is right or fair does n't matter . And I think that if you go to extreme measures to be out then you might get a recode and three letters that prevent you from joining any branch . I was just wondering why you want to switch to the army ? I mean , you went through the process of it all and MEPS I am assuming why leave now ? You said if the military is not really for you , you would go to school . Do you just want out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought since his contract was binding he would get a code if he tried to break it . Then again Marines are n't the army . I just know in a previous forum one member said they did the same in DEP and had that problem . <p> And I am curious too that 's why I asked . He did all the work up to it and as you said he knew the timing when he signed . <p> 2 ) It is extremely subjective for the reasons I lined out previously . Regulations do not override your contractual obligation . Do you know how many try to back out and then change their mind . Technically speaking , you can request it all day long , every day ... but until you miss your shipdate , it is not anything that really falls outside of the regulations or your contractual obligation . Further , processing DEP losses is very , very low on the priority list . Those who are enlisting and shipping sit higher on the priority list and it takes them a bit of effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) Once again , you need to do your research . You can enlist for a career group , not a specific MOS . If your contract does not list that specific career group , then you are open . If you want to move up your shipdate , they may NOT have the career group or enlistment options that you want available within the timeframe that you want to ship out . This means that you would have to change your options to ship at that time . Your only option to ship within the timeframe that you want could be to go open contract . That may be all that is available . There are not infinite amounts of slots for each enlistment option leaving at all times . They have to manage their courses and their manning requirements . <p> 5 ) Your contract states that you agree to ship out on X date for X contract options . That is enough to override the regulations . The IG will review all guidance and regulations , and then they will ask the commander why they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a valid reason that falls within the appropriate guidance , then there is nothing that the IG will do . If I were this commander , I would want you gone fast because I would not want unmotivated people joining my service . However , they have their guidance to follow as well as they have other experience to base decisions off of . If they are seeing that 10% try to DEP loss , and 8% of those who try to DEP loss end up shipping out because they change their mind , they have a good case to hold you until your shipdate or longer . <p> 6 ) Your contract states that you will abide by the terms of it . That is all the consent they need from you to hold you in the DEP until a time where you have missed your shipdate . <p> MCOs and DODIs are NOT legally binding . They are not laws that must be followed . They are regulatory guidance . There is a saying in the military ... you can add to the regulations but not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you are talking about , but it simply not the case . As a XO , I was able to write policies which were tougher than the guiding ARs in order to resolve issues within my unit . The ARs said one thing , my policy letter ( which was vetted through all appropriate channels ) made the AR and punitive measures more strict . My commander had the authority to sign these and enact them for the unit . If you look at AR 40-501 and AR 601-210 , you will see a lot of things that would make recruitment look so easy for those who require waivers , etc . However , when you start seeing the UMs which further restrict the ARs through policy , you can see that the AR ( and similarly MCOs and DODIs ) are simply guidance which may be added at as required in order to meet mission requirements . <p> You signed the contract . You legally agreed to fulfill this contract . They are under no obligation to release you from this contract . As egloskerry stated , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not do this , but they can . This legally binding document supersedes all other guidance . Sorry , but this is the mess you made and you will have to be patient . <p> They did n't . Maybe they had a recruiter that did n't want to work with them , but it had nothing to do with a code that appears on your DD214 . Technically an RA recruit is n't in the Army until they ship . <p> They will give me an uncharacterized entry-level separation . I never heard of anyone getting a recode and three letters . I learned more about the Marine Corps over the past couple of months and realized the U.S. Army is a better option for me . The U.S. Army can guarantee me my desired job as well as an early shipment date and most importantly they have more specialized school . I also refuse to wait another 11 more months from the Marine Corp to be shipped off to bootcamp . If I were able to get out DEP before October then I would highly consider joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . I always love the military but it was n't for me then I have to move on . <p> I do n't entirely know how the Corps DEP works , but I suspect it 's the same as the Army where you 're only in the IRR . You can not receive a discharge from the IRR prior to having any actual service time . I 'm 99.9% sure you wo n't receive an ELS , neither will you have an RE or sep code . You 'll be a DEP loss which is n't anything . <p> When I signed the contract it said that I 'm leaving in December 19 , 2016 . Then a few weeks later my recruiter and the commanding recruiter told me that they will move my shipment date to the summer of next year , because my job is not available . If I only knew then I would never signed it and save myself the troubles .

@@95985898 @185898/ <p> I 'm a prospective Army ROTC participant and I have a few questions regarding what a USACE average day may be like . I have a small idea of what this organization does but a simple overview of what it does will be extremely helpful . I apologize if some of these questions are very obvious , yet they are not to me . Also , I 'd like to apologize to this discussion for making it extremely specific , but any information I can get before I decide upon my future will help me in my endeavor . Any/all answers to these questions will help ! <p> 1 . ) What are some average day-to-day things should I expect to do ? <p> 2 . ) Will a Master 's degree help me at all in this field ? <p> 3 . ) What is the range of rank for this corps ? In other words , what is the average rank of an engineer ? <p> 4 . ) Should I expect combat during wartime ? Assuming our military already has enough soldiers to conduct its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours I should expect to work ? <p> 6 . ) Is vacation time allotted ?

Such as is there a sniper team , a ground team , an air team , etc. ? <p> 14 . ) Is this field competitive or does anyone wanting to get in able to get in ? I have not been able to research and find the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even expect to get in . <p> Again , I apologize for asking the abundance of questions although these questions are what I have been yearning to ask any USACE personnel . Thanks , as well , for taking the time to answers these , for giving me an overview of this organization , and for helping me gain a better understanding ! <p> 1 ) This can depend on your assignment . Please be aware , that if you commission into Engineer Branch , you may or may not get an assignment to USACE in your entire career . Trust me , it is a goal of mine to get there , so I am paying very close attention to it . Some are able to get multiple assignments at USACE and even climb up the USACE leadership channels . If you are deadset on USACE ... then civilian is the only way to ensure that is the only place you go . Most will not start off with a USACE assignment and it can be hard to get to one . If you have a degree , licensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignments require it . <p> 2 ) All Officers are expected to pursue a Masters degree . For Engineers , we actually have a program that allows us to pursue a Masters ( Geological Engineering , Civil Engineering , Engineering Managment or Environmental Engineering ) through a program during our Captains Career Course . A Masters definitely helps and it is an expectation that every Officer will get one . Many of us work on our online . <p> 3 ) We have Engineer Officers from 2LT all the way to LTG . There may be a GEN or two out there that are EN Officers , but I am going up the Engineer chain , straight to the Chief of Engineers who is a LTG . Most retire around LTC , but that is their choice . <p> 4 ) Once again , as an Officer you may be with a Combat Engineer unit or a Contruction unit within the Big Army . You also may be assigned to an Engineer Det within the Big Army . All of these do deploy during wartime to conduct missions . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other Engineering missions . USACE DOES deploy both military and civlians to combat zones as well . This means that you may be assigned to a warzone with USACE as well . The Transatlantic Division of USACE was heavily involved in Iraq and Afghanistan . I worked with some from USACE when I was deployed . <p> 5 ) This is not a normal job . In a Big Army assignment , you will get up early and might stay late . My average day is from about 0600-1700 ( maybe a little earlier in the evening ) including PT , but I am in a cush assignment right now . There are times where long hours are common , and you may be in the field for a few days to a few weeks sometimes . Believe it or not , I have more freetime now than when I worked in the civlian world . For USACE , it may vary , but if major projects are in critical phases , you may be stuck out for a while or have to travel to the project sites if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 days of leave a year as a military member . I can not speak for USACE 's Civilian employees . That is hard to beat in the civilian world . <p> 7 ) Get an ABET accredited Engineering degree . I recommend a Civil Engineering degree ( focus in Structural , Geotechnical , Archictectural , or Construction Engineering ) . Mechanical and Electrical are also useful and sometimes underserved . We have a shortage of actual degreed Engineers since the Army will assign non-Engineer majors to the Engineer branch . At least pursue a Construction Management degree . <p> 8 ) Promotions are very solid . We have an above average promotion percentage for each rank . <p> 9 ) You will be assigned to a post and may live in on-post housing ( if married ) or you can live off-post . There is no housing for single Officers , and many will get an apartment off-post . Do not plan on staying local to where you are now . Also , expect to move every three years or so . <p> 10 ) Absolutely . Trust me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have received at least ten emails in the past few months advertising Engineering jobs where they want to hire former Army Engineers . If you network through AEA and SAME , then you can make some amazing connections that can lead to jobs . I know exactly who I would call if I left the Army tomorrow and feel as though it would be no problem to find employment . <p> 11 ) All types . Seriously . We all have our little quirks about us . If you are willing to work hard , not so shy that you ca n't take control and lead , and are willing to be flexible ..... it is easy to succeed here . <p> 12 ) There are so many projects that it is impossible to list them all . Just know that any major infrastructure project ( dams , grids , etc ) where are least coordinated by USACE if not outright USACE projects . Many USACE projects will be completed by civilian firms and companies , but will have USACE oversight . <p> 13 ) Not really . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airborne , etc . We have Engineer Divers ( if you can swim , are in great shape , and get a shot to tryout at BOLC .... TAKE IT ! ) . Our units are pretty one dimensional in their purpose . For example , you might be a PL in a Clearance Company leading a RCP . You could also be a PL in a Horizontal Construction Company leading Soldiers and managing construction projects . Our units are pretty specialized , but overall as an Engineer Officer , you have to be a jack of all trades . <p> 14 ) If you go through ROTC , and you get an ABET accredited degree , you can ADSO for Engineer Branch . This means that you can guarantee that you get Engineer as your branch by committing to serve an additional amount of time in the Army ( 6 years versus 4 ... I think ) . This could change , but we are short degree engineers so the degree is the lynch pin of this . As an Engineer Officer , you are a generalist . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means you can rotate between an assignment in a Combat Company , a Construction Company , FEST Teams , USACE , non-Engineer assignments , etc . <p> One thing to ensure that you need to note : USACE is an Organization within the Army that is comprised of civilians and military members that is focuses around major engineering projects and other more technically focuses projects and work . As an Officer , you commission into the Engineer branch . That means you may be assigned to any 12A coded positions for your rank , or any 01A/02A slot at well ( many training positions , recruiting , etc ) . We can get assigned to USACE , but we are most often assigned to the " Big Army . " As a 2LT , there are NO USACE slots . As a 1LT , there are a couple , but they are nominative ( you have to apply through branch ) . As a CPT and above , assignments to USACE become more possible . <p> Thank you so much for being able to answer so quickly and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own path in the direction I want to go and you have given me the wheel to be able to do so !

@@95985933 @185933/ <p> I 'm enlisting to Army Reserve and I 'm choosing MOS right now . I 'm interested in 15 series and 91 series . Does anyone have experience with these MOS ? My wish is that I could be deployed oversea at least once . I do n't care whether it 's a warzone or not.My questions are : <p> 1 . How often could I be deployed ? Once I 'm deployed , how long will it likely be ? I will sign a contract of 6 year active reserve and 2 year inactive reserve . <p> 2 . Among these MOS , which are the most likely to be deployed oversea ? <p> 3 . If I 'm deployed , I will be paid according to my rank by Army only and I wo n't receive anything from my civilian job , right ? <p> 1 . In a six year term , you could technically be deployed twice . In reality , you may only get one deployment if that . There 's also a very good chance you will deploy with another unit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join . I really ca n't speak for 15 series . Overall , if you 're looking at deployments , 31B , 88M , 88H , or 88N are probably better choices . <p> 3 . You 'll be paid by your rank plus BAH/BAS and any other specialty pays depending on where you get deployed . Some civilian employers will continue to pay you or make up the difference in pay ( some rail roads ) . <p> I am someone who entered the Army Reserves where there was little conflict in the world and left the Army National Guard to go active duty a few years after 9/11 happened . <p> When I switched to active , my National Guard unit was finally activated to deploy . I ended up seeing them in Kuwait when I was with the 101st Airborne but I was heading to Iraq . <p> The point is that pick a job that interests you and not because of the deployment factor . You will have to do your homework in regards to the unit that you will be serving with in your area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a National Guard unit in the same area and did that unit deploy ? I say this because I started out as a 12B combat engineer in the Reserves and the 12Bs that I knew did more in the National Guard than I did in the Army Reserves , so research between the two . <p> When I was activated on annual training , I was able to double dip . When 9/11 happened and I activated with my Guard unit for Operation Noble Eagle , I was paid the difference of what I usually made . So for example , if you bring home $2000 a month for your job and with the Reserves , you bring home $1000 a month on active duty , then your job will pay you $1000 to make up the difference . Understand ? <p> Usually , you end up making more because a unit can generate a memo based on what you are receiving and they will omit special pays and tax exemptions which leaves getting more in the end . <p> I am based in Korea and I have seen many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friend was a Reservist that deployed to Japan for active ? Or what he/she active from the beginning ? <p> Again , outside of MOS , it will depend on the unit and how soldiers in the unit are augmented . All those MOSes you listed are deployable . <p> Actually we do . Though only for training . I did 90 days in Okinawa and 30 days on Hokkaido . For oki I rotated with marines from k-bay . Hokkaido I went with 1-27 INF. 25th I 'd as a scout sniper attachment . I also went with 1-21 INF to cobra gold in Thailand . <p> I did a rotation into Australia , never did Guam though . Stopped at the airport in Guam once coming from cobra gold back to Hawaii lol . I also did the Sinai rotation in Egypt for 6 months . The army was super cool before the war . Or maybe it 's because I rotated through 4 units in Hawaii , seemed like I always hit when they had a cool training deployment . The bad part , I did 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did get to literally " see the world " so fair trade . The Army always GAVE as much as it took in my career . I was really lucky . <p> Thank you . So actually some civilian employers ( only some army-friendly employers and I told them I am in the reserve before I work with them ) will pay the difference between the money I usually make and the money I make in deployed army reserve . If the civilian employer wo n't pay the difference , army reserve unit will try to pay me the difference in other ways , right ? <p> My friend 's contract begins as active duty and he is assigned to Japan for his first mission . <p> The reserves wo n't " pay the difference " . They will pay you what an active duty soldier makes , and any special allowances if applicable . ( Housing , subsidence , hazardous duty , etc .. ) It 's important to understand that " most " civilian employers will be less likely to pay you anything while you 're gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to work at equal position and payment when you return . I have heard of people in some federal/contractor jobs getting their full salary plus military pay . <p> Keep in mind this is assuming you are even activated and deployed . There is no way for you to control these factors , so the point is moot .

Water is an essential nutrient that is critical to reaching your best physical performance . It is also important for good health because it plays an important role in maintaining normal body temperature . The evaporation of sweat helps cool the body during exercise , so water lost through sweating must be replaced because lack of hydration can lead to poor performance and possible injury . Sweat consists primarily of water with small quantities of minerals like sodium . Cool , plain water is the best drink to use to replace the fluid lost as sweat . Experts recommend drinking water before , during , and after exercise to prevent dehydration and help enhance performance . <p> Sports drinks , which are usually simple carbohydrates ( sugars ) and electrolytes dissolved in water , are helpful under certain circumstances .

@@95986029 @186029/ <p> Long story short , a buddy of mine who served 4 years on active duty got out and joined the IRR . He then transferred to a TPU unit for some government job or something . He now works in the private sector and ca n't allow his drills and AT get in the way of being productive at his real job . Also , they want to send him to some reclass school for two months , which is a big no-no for his employer . <p> Anyway , he somehow has some three day and four day drills on his drill schedule , which he and his employer both agree is unacceptable . The career counselors always talk that one weekend a month **** . Well , Thursday , Friday , and Monday are n't weekends . Can a reserve unit really expect private sector professionals to just ditch their jobs during the week sometimes ? How do they expect employers to be supportive . It 's easy for some people that do n't have real jobs ( full time staff , gov employees , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Anyway , what are the repercussions of him just skipping out on these middle of the week field trips ? His army bosses are full time staff , so they if course wo n't let him RST . Will he just be busted down to E4 and let him ride out his contract , intermittently missing those three and four day drills ? <p> I get that the reserve stuff he has to do is kind of important , but I can also see why he and his employer also do n't take it seriously . I mean , skipping work where you make a high salary to make 300 bucks or so is a little absurd . <p> So , what do reserve units typically do in situations like this ? Just kind of brush it under the table or what ? <p> First , three and four day drills are not unacceptable . The Reserves is expected to be an operational force and it is hard to train everything if you only have Soldiers for two days at a time . It is vital that Soldiers receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one method of gaining the time needed to do so . This is perfectly acceptable . The idea that the Reserves are only there for a convenience factor is a horrid myth that needs to be squashed immediately . We are an operational force that must be able to meet mission needs when called . My Soldiers know what is expected of them . The training schedule is post almost a full year in advance . There is no excuse for not making appropriate arrangements . Yes , there can be times where a Soldier is excused from drill due to something either unforeseeable or due to something that they do not control the scheduling of ( such as a wedding for someone else ) , but the onus is on the Soldier to communicate this and work it out with their Chain of Command . Certain events can not be missed because there is not an opportunity to make up those events . People with " real jobs " successfully coordinate their drill schedules with their employers every week . I know many who have to take more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you buddy also joined the Reserves to be in TPU status for a government job ( likely a technician job ) , then his bosses should understand the neccesity of these things and be supportive . The receive specific leave for military duty , and also are likely to know the command that the Soldier is assigned to know the routine of that unit . If he were to lose his status as a TPU due to not showing up , he could lose his job as well . <p> The reclass school is also acceptable . Your buddy decided to join a unit in a will-train status and agreed to go to the reclass school . That is perfectly acceptable and extremely common . <p> If your buddy misses drills , then they can reduce his rank based on local policy and after hitting 11 U 's ( missed MUTAs ... one typical drill weeking is comprised of four ) , they can process him for discharge . Skipping required training without being excused is a big deal . <p> The Reserves do more than stuff that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of time with our Soldiers and have to coordinate our training to maximize what the Army requires of us and what our Soldiers need . I do n't care about the Salary disparity of a Soldier 's civilian job and their drill pay . They volunteered . They stated they are willing to make that sacrifice . It 's something that is common among Reservists . Most TPU Soldiers make more at their civilian job . It 's also not like drills are 3-4 days each month . A unit doing that would run out of MUTAs before the year was half completed . Also , most government employees get military leave which may actually pay the difference or continue their salary during drill , AT , training , etc. depending on departmental policies . <p> The frankness of it is : a Soldier volunteering for this is required to meet their statutory obligation and required to make whatever plans need to be made . If your friend is having issues with this , they may need to request to be releasaed to the IRR ... which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to do is stop showing up and they just process him out ? <p> Also , he got an amazing job while in the reserve , and now makes a lot more money . His unit does n't cooperate with him because they are mostly government employees or they work in retail , so drill pay actually means something to them . <p> So basically , just stop showing up , and you get out ? Too easy . Maybe the Army should n't expect so much out of reservists since they constantly have real life issues like jobs and moving to worry about . It 's this ' the reserve comes first ' mentality that is messed up <p> They are n't active duty and they have to go to thier jobs . Not everyone has an employer that supports missing work for Army stuff . My bud works for a prestigious company but they think missing work for a part time job is absurd . <p> Anyway , so he should just stop showing up , even on the regular weekends and he gets out ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone does n't show because its inconvenient that is a whole other story . The Army Reserve has to expect exactly what the nation expects out of us : a well-trained , well-equipped Army that is ready to answer the call . We ca n't do that if we limit everything to conveninece only . This is a committment that every Soldier agrees to when they join . <p> Soldiers are protected by USERRA , so there employers are actually bound by federal law to comply with their ordered duties . You can think it is absurd that a " part-time " job requires all of this , but very few other " part-time " jobs place people in mortal danger and require them to support such work . This is not something that someone can be lazy about . Once again , 98% of Soldiers out there understand that committment and make it work . I know many , many Reservists who have professional jobs at very prestigious places . I have had Soldiers or other leaders who have been : DAs , Brokers on Wall Street , Real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Managers for major Companies , a couple of CEOs in my command , Engineers , and any number of other professions .... and each of them understood the committment needed to complete their duty and made it work . I am sorry , but having a job somewhere that does n't agree with the Army 's schedule is not a good excuse . <p> If your friend stops showing up , the Army can look to recoup benefits and cancel others . By just not showing up , he is going against what he swore to do and there is little excuse to doing it . The discharge will likely be OTH , which can affect many other aspects of his life . It can have a major impact on employment and certain fiscal products , like homeloans . Not showing up is NOT the answer . It will create further issues which he may not feel for a few years . If he does this , he needs to be prepared to face the consequences which may hold him back in many ways . One example of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Series 7 pulled by FINRA when FINRA completed a revalidation check on them . They lost an extremely high paying job at one of the best investment banks on Wall Street due to this . They went from making in the mid-six figures to zero in the matter of an afternoon . FINRA would n't license them with an OTH discharge . <p> He can request to go IRR , but he would have to maintain status until they complete his packet , which can take a few weeks to a few months depending on workload of the 1 shop . <p> So basically , the reserve can lie to someone about the one weekend a month , thereby not honoring thier word , while at the same time punishing someone for saying ' enough is enough ' ? I just do n't see how reserve forces can expect everyone and thier employer to cater to them . <p> As for userra , it sounds good on paper . However , employment at will allows your boss to fire you for anything else . I have seen this before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known HR folks whose sole job it was to rid thier company of guards/reserve peope who decided to do mote than the one weekend . So , I can see why my friend is choosing his full time employer over his reserve trips . To think that the reserve tries to mess up your life over it shows what types of people run things . <p> .... and of course he shares no responsibility in this at all . As someone who spent four years on AD , he should know what questions to ask and be able to do his own leg work . Quit acting like someone got one over on him . He just failed to do the proper leg work . <p> I think you are making judgements and it 's due to ignorance . I juggled a great paying tech job and had a some muta5 and 6 for the fiscal year . Also , I know government employees that make six figures and serve in the reserves and guard . I had friends that were in retail as management pulling high salaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking has protection under the ESGR and needs to work out a plan with all parties . It 's not rocket science . It 's called planning and maturity . <p> This reminds me of those conversations with Soldiers coming from AD who think that the Reserves are full of a bunch of ( insert favorite one-liner here ) and are not real Soldiers and then complain when they are expected to be a Soldier . <p> LT , I agree . I have witnessed Soldiers that spent 4 to 8 years on active duty and get involuntary separated when they were in the Guard because they failed to understand the level of commitment that is required of them . They think by not showing up , it will fix the problem but ultimately , they just made matters worse .

@@95986046 @186046/ <p> Long story short . My fiance and i were pregnant , i decided it woukd be best to join the army to get medical care for our soon to be born daughter . I went to recruitment and was told that i would have to join before the baby was born because single parents are n't  allowed in the military . So i did . my daughter was born 5 months later . i was assured that putting her on a as dependent would be wasy provided i had her birth certificate and paternity papers do i could move them down with me right away and get bah and a place to live off post . THAT DID NT HAPPEN . My daughter is 10 months old now and still living in a different state . i cleared my barracks and am still getting only single soldier pay , not even bah diff. so here i am still paying for my old apartment but cant afford much of anything else . I have my paternity papers , i have her birth certificate and ss card , i have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm currently living out of my car . The only thing that I have accomplished is getting her enrolled in DEERS . I was told EverytHing was in order , so i got permission to Live off pist and cjear barracks . So I went to finance , they told me to get lost or get married , my paperwork is n't good enough even though my command and housing agree that it is , in looking at a ton of back pay but ca n't get it , so i went to aer to get a losn to get a place , but was denied because now apparently i need a court order for custody and child support but i cant get that because since we are not separated , no judge will open a case or sign our current parebting plan . why would i pay child support and custody when we plan to live together anyway ? ! so now i 'm stuck homeless and my daughter is developing separation issues all because i can only see her on weekends and ive missed so many milestones slready. i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that discrimination and ilkegal to do so just yo get the benegits i should already be entitled to as i do have a dependent . Marriage is n't an option right now for various reasons including religious . even my command is at a loss . i 'm not alllowed to live in the barracks . IDK what to do . I AM A MALE , USING SHARED EMAIL With my fiance in case the name throws you off <p> What post are you at that there will be someone in finance that will tell you " to get lost or get married " ? Did you get that person 's name ? Did you go to finance with your NCO ? You should have . <p> If you have a dependent in DEERS ; then you rate BAH with the dependent 's rate . It is that simple . I will go back to your leadership and explain the issue . I do not know why your command will allow a soldier of theirs live in a vehicle . You should be engaging your NCO and they should be helping you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E-1 and E-4 . <p> Furthermore , I will submit an ICE complaint , visit legal and make an IG complaint . If you are telling us what happened , then that is unacceptable . <p> Legally , you are single . Single Soldiers are required to live in the barracks under a certain rank . It 's very simple . Many single Soldiers have children and must support them . Stating that in order to statutorily qualify to live off-post you have to be married is NOT illegal nor discriminatory . It is evenly enforced across the military and everyone experiences the same regulations . If you do n't want to marry your " fiance " then it is on you to figure out your scheduled time with your daughter and determine a budget that allows you to provide support . This is honestly no different than any other Soldier wanting to move out of the barracks to live with their fiance or whatever , except that you have the complication of having a child . That does not equate to you being allowed to have an exception to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require a custody order and child support order . That is what the Army uses to substantiate your claim . There are many who would use their children to pull one over on the Army ( as horrid as that sounds , I have seen it ) . <p> Just because you cleared the barracks does not mean that you are not allowed in them . If they do not have room for you in the barracks , they need to issue a statement so that housing can either find you another barracks room or provide you with the needed statement so that you can start collecting BAH . While your commander may clear you to live off-post , it does not mean that the Army will allow it and there are many hoops to jump through for a junior enlisted , single Soldier to live off-post . Command approval is only one of them . Statutorily speaking , to live off-post based on your daughter ( dependency without marriage ) you would have to have court ordered custody that is 180-days a year or more . Outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live off-post . <p> Basically , without those court documents , you have no real recourse to collect BAH for off-post housing unless there is not an availability of on-post options ( ie : barracks ) . <p> Your best option may be to see if you can get her to move to you ( apply for a loan at the bank , borrow from family , whatever if you ca n't afford it ) and find a way to make it work on your base pay alone . If you are refusing to get married and do n't have the required court documents , then the onus of your decisions is truly on you . You are listing reasons to not marry your fiance . To me , that would be a bit of a red flag .... so I am going to assume there is more to this story . <p> I know that this is not a rosey picture to paint , but it is the honest picture . Your fiance does not exist to the Army until you are married . She could not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are on a closed post ) , utilize medical facilities , get Tricare , nothing . Your daughter can and exists to the Army ... but as a single Soldier with no court ordered support or custody , your legally required support to her is non-existent by law and does not permit the Army the needed backing documents to provide you with additional support to help you provide for her . Legally , without a court ordered agreement ... you could refuse to see her or support her in any way , pocket the money and benefits , and not provide anything to the child at all and your fiance would have no legal recourse until such an order is in place . That is the legality of it and why the Army requires the additional documentation . <p> Chief ..... I looked it up . If he does n't have court ordered custody agreement that demonstrates that he is legally required to hold custody for 180 days or more , he does n't meet the requirements for BAH w/ Dependents rate unless there is no available barracks space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a court ordered child support agreement . As horrid as that sounds , it is in the requirements . <p> Most finance peoole are rude to begin with , they get worse when you arebt married and they think that you " are trying to loophole them and avoid gettting married . i forgot his name but i asked to see a superviosr that was conveniently " out " at the time . Ive been to finance more times than i can count with and without my command . I was told to clear my barracks as a last step to start BAH , i gave up my meal card and now that it shows that i have a dependent , I 'm not allowed government quarters , yet my dependent status and lack of housing still is n't good enough to get BAH started . it makes no sense . <p> If that is the case , he should get BAH w/o dependent rate ( if that is what you mean by BAH diff ) and should get the required back pay . Granted that will be based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but yet you have a child out of wedlock ( I am catholic ) . If you love the kid 's mother and intend to be with her ; then I suggest you get married . I do not understand why since you call her your fiance . <p> But if you do not want to ; then understand the situation and road blocks you are experiencing . <p> Nowhere anywhere says anything about a court order . It says legal documentation of support and primary custody does n't require a judge unless there is a disagreement and then the court decides . Since we are not separated and do not disagree to our terms our notarized parenting plan is supposed to be sufficient . Mediation was all we needed . we called the courts here to give the army it 's bottle and shut them up but the court itself says that it can do nothing until we are separated and legal action is warranted . state laws and army laws are different and they do n't  always sync up and now we are in limbo . personally its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even if someone just does n't want to , but its because we are two different strict religions that both require conversion and/or months of pre marriage counseling , also marriage is n't something to just jump in to . My family is just as valid as anyone else 's . Not long ago gay couples were in the same boat , was it right just because it was " just the way it is " ? We are not concerned with benefits for my fiance , that is not the issue . I Just want to collect Bah ( which i should be ebtitled to , seeibg as i do n't  live in quarters snd have no meal card , dependents rate , aside , i should be recieving it ) . So i can have my family with me. its that simple . I 'm absolutely not trying to pull a fast one here . This is why even my command is baffled and its finance standing in the way . They take my packet and say its fine and then kick it back a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing it 's another . soon as i fix the last thing , its something new that they missed before or the packet just goes missing altogether . Also , i 'm at ft.bliss tx . <p> Talk to your 1SG again . Also , go to legal for advice ( based on what finance is telling you ) and also make an IG compliant due to the length that this issue has been going on with no resolution and your current status of living in a vehicle . IG usually gets involved in non-support issues and they should be able to assist in this regard . <h> How BAH Works <p> BAH is money given to you by the government to help you pay for housing . In most cases , you cant live in government quarters to qualify . The government determines BAH based on several factors : your pay grade , whether you have dependents , and the median housing cost for the geographical area where you 're stationed or where your family is living . BAH generally will not cover all your housing costs , but it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the higher your BAH will be . If you 're stationed away from your family , such as if you 're on active duty , BAH is intended to cover their housing costs even though you 're living on base . <h> Effect of Divorce <p> If you and your spouse have no children together , and if you are the service member , you 'll continue to receive BAH post-divorce , provided you do n't move into single-unit government housing . If you continue living off-base , you 'll receive the BAH-WITHOUT rate rather than the BAH-WITH rate because you no longer have a dependent -- your spouse . <h> Effect of Custody ( I know you are not divorced or separated but this validates how you support your children - You could of setup an allotment to prove your support ) <p> The issue becomes more complicated if you have children . You 'll continue to receive BAH , but at either the BAH-DIFF rate or the BAH-WITH rate , depending on your custody arrangement and where you live post-divorce . If you move into single-unit government housing after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll receive BAH-DIFF if your child support obligation is at least as much as that calculated amount . If you live off-base , you can still claim your children as dependents and qualify for BAH-WITH , even if you do n't  have custody . However , your child support obligation must be equal to or greater than the BAH-DIFF rate you would have received if you lived in single-unit government housing . If you do have custody , your children are your dependents , regardless of the fact that , in most cases , you would not be paying child support . <h> BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING ( BAH ) <p> The purpose of BAH is to provide active duty military personnel with accurate and equitable housing compensation based on housing costs in local civilian housing markets when government housing is not provided . The BAH rates are based on geographic duty location , pay grade , and dependency status . <p> Military personnel who are living in government quarters and who have no dependents are entitled to " Partial BAH " . <p> Military personnel who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entitled to " BAH " at the " without dependents " rate . <p> Military personnel who are eligible for BAH and who have dependent family members are entitled to a greater amount of BAH , referred to as " BAH at the ' with dependents ' rate " . To be eligible for BAH at the " with dependents " rate , military members/noncustodial parents ( NCPs ) must pay toward the support of his/her dependents an amount that is AT LEAST equal to the difference between BAH at the " with dependents " and " without dependents " rates each month . <p> If two ( 2 ) military parents are supporting the same child , only one of the military parents is entitled to BAH at the " with dependents " rate . Forfeiture of the " with dependents " portion of BAH does not relieve a military member/NCP of his/her obligation to support family members . <p> To procure BAH , military members/NCPs must go to their local finance officer , establish that they do not live on the military base in assigned family quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request BAH . If the military member is the father of a child born out of wedlock , paternity must be legally established before BAH can be awarded . A female service member who has a child born out of wedlock is awarded BAH automatically if she is the principal caretaker of the child or if the child has another principal caretaker who is receiving WFFA/TANF . <p> I would think that if the child is in DEERS since you provided proof of the birth certificate ; that should be sufficient to receive BAH . Legal or IG should inform you if anything else ( in regards to the custody that was discussed ) needs to be provided . <p> BAH is a temporary remedy for support . CSS caseworkers should continue to pursue the establishment of an order for support and initiate income withholding . <p> BAH II is the equivalent to what used to be BAQ ( Basic Allowance for Quarters ) and does not vary by geographic location . It is the housing allowance , or is used to calculate the housing allowance , for military personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for less than twenty ( 20 ) weeks , military personnel in confinement , etc . <p> BAH-DIFF ( Differential ) is the housing allowance amount for military personnel who are assigned to single-type quarters and who are authorized to receive BAH solely by reason of their payment of child support . Military personnel are not entitled to BAH-DIFF if the monthly amount of child support that they owe is less than the BAH-DIFF amount . <p> Even though you do not get BAH based on the amount of dependents you have . My BAH for my rank with three dependents if the same BAH for someone with my rank with two or four dependents . <p> The regulations state a court order . Notorized agreements still hold little legal value and could be argued against . I am not saying that you are trying to pull one , but it is what is required . Try IG and JAG . Frankly , you should not have been cleared from the barracks without the other aspects of this being cleared and approved . IG may be able to help find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you circumvent this requirement with the documentation that you do have . Finance CAN be wrong on occassion , but likely they will require something that is court-ordered due to the legal nature of this situation . IF they grant you BAH , they will likely not PCS your fiance and daughter to your location , so that will likely come out of your pocket . <p> BAH-Diff is the housing allowance amount for a member who is assigned to single-type quarters and who is authorized a basic allowance for housing solely by reason of the member 's payment of child support . A member is not entitled to BAH-Diff if the monthly rate of that child support is less than the BAH-Diff . BAH-Diff is determined by the SECDEF and was equal to the difference between BAQ with dependents and BAQ without dependents in 1997 for the member 's grade . BAH-Diff is published annually and is determined by increasing the previous year 's rates by the percentage growth of military basic pay . <p> This is typically what single Soldiers with non-custodial care of a child dependent are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

I talked to Major Adams about some of the things that I can feed on to the management and to the coaching staff . Just as you guys do , you 're trying to recruit the best talent to work in the Army . We have certain needs that we have on our team . We 're trying to identify what roles we need filled . I showed him the structure of what builds a team and the four factors that really go into that .

You know there 've been a couple times that we 've you know , gone against my actual sense going into a game .

Once you have obtained an I-551 Permanent Resident Card ( green card ) or the G-845 which verifies your approval for permanent residency , you can begin the process for enlistment . <p> How long it takes to get a green card depends entirely on the path taken , the applicant 's country of birth , and when the applicant began processing . For example , a person who qualifies in the employment-based first preference classification , or who is an immediate relative of a US citizen could obtain lawful permanent resident status in six to nine months , start to finish . On the other hand , most other employment-based applications take a minimum of nine to 12 months even under the best of circumstances , and generally take upwards of three years . Non-immediate relative family-based immigration can take between five and 15 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The final step involves filing an application for adjustment of status with the USCIS , or filing an immigrant visa application with a US Department of State consular office abroad . Consular immigrant visa processing rarely takes more than six months . Adjustment of status , historically , has taken between three and five years . <p> Family-based immigration involves two steps : the filing of the preference petition ( I-130 ) and the application for immigrant status . When an I-130 petition is filed , the filing date becomes the immigrant 's priority date . When the priority date becomes " current " then the applicant may file for immigrant status through adjustment of status or overseas consular processing . Because of the severe backlogs in all family-based categories , applicants other than immediate relatives should expect to wait many years before becoming eligible to apply for immigrant status . <p> To become an enlisted soldier in the US Army , you must be : <p> A US citizen , US National , or permanent resident alien <p> 17-34 years old ( 17 requires parental consent ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions are a DQ ) <p> In good moral standing ( certain criminal charges are a DQ ) <p> If you have children , must be married or without custody ( waivers available for AR ) <p> Have a High School Diploma or equivalent <p> Score a minimum of 31 on the AFQT portion of the ASVAB ( test is only available in English ) <p> Some MOS may have additional qualifications <p> If you are not a US citizen or legal resident alien , and you have lived in the US for at least two years , with no absence greater than 90 consecutive days , your only option is the MAVNI program . <p> I am still waiting on my med review . Hopefully i will hear soon . I have always wanted to be a cop in the civilian side just with the draw down so many soliders apply to be cop and departments love them so they are getting the jobs . Since i have always considered the army for a career i just do n't know if i want to be a cop for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wards . So i am trying too figure out what I want to do . There are two jobs that i would like to do while in the army i just ca n't do both . Flight Warrent officer or drill sergeant . My wife wants me to avoid any heavy combat jobs , but she knows no matter what my MOS is I can end up in combact , she just wants to reduce those chances . <p> Well MP and Flight Warrant can experience heavy combat . Flight warrant is something you can apply to now or when you are on active duty . Drill Sergeant is usually a DA selection ( the Army picks you for this duty ) and this happens when you are an E-6 with about six years of service under your belt . No guarantee for selection and no guarantee if you apply for it later down your career . <p> O i know neither one is easy to obtain ( DS , Pilot ) but I 'm not afraid of work . My wife would prefer me in a helo and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , just the ability to serve and provide a good future for my family is what maters most to me . Those are just to paths that have always been an intetest to me . That 's the good thing about the Army there is a lot of things to do . if you have any MOS Suggestions i am all ears . <p> I have taken it . I did that while waiting on my med review . Plus it is easier with my family siuation to do it seperately . I do n't know them all our the top of my head but i do remember the GT and CL . The rest Only because they were all grouped in the same score range . <p> GT 118 , CL 119 and the rest was 122-124 . <p> Any sugestions you have like i said i am all ears . I waited 4 mo just to be asked for more info , which was provided last friday . So hopefully soon , my recuiter did n't  seem to worried about the kidney stone and thinks I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But MEPS gets the final say . <p> With that GT ( what is your AFQT ? ) , you qualify for most jobs . You need to decide what is for you . I been working with computers for over 20 years but I spent five years of my life in law enforcement . So have your main choice and a secondary and go for it . Remember , your choice will will also depend on availability . <p> My AFQT was an 80 . The only jobs my recuriter has told me I ca n't do involve jumping out of perfectly good airplanes . Plus I already have my BA . My aunt and uncle who did 12 and 15 years are telling me too go for the medical field . Xray tech or equipment repair . Which is smart for once I decide to leave the Army but that 's so far away from now . What is your MOS ? If you do n't mind me asking . <p> I am a Chief Warrant Officer MOS 255Sierra which is Information Protection Technician . Warrant Officers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are that special . <p> Basically , my MOS relates to computer/cyber security and defensive cyber operations . I have held over six MOSes since I joined the military in 1983 . The reason that I am not retired yet is because of my reserve time . I do not have 20 years active as of yet . But either I will early retire this year ( with immediate pension ) or stay in for the full 20 . If not , I will retire with 17 years with near 26 years total service and I am ok with that . <p> The only MOS that requires you to jump is Rigger and going into SF ( and I believe signing up for the Ranger Regiment . ) I do not know any other jobs that demand you jump out of a plane . <p> If you get airborne qualified , then you can serve active jump status units ; but that is it .

@@95986094 @186094/ <p> I 'm asking this on behalf of my husband . He has been in the process of trying to enlist active duty Army for a year now . Much of that time was spent gathering medical records about his hypothyroid condition , which he was ultimately cleared for because he has been off medication and symptom free for over a year now . <p> This past weekend he was FINALLY supposed to go to MEPs but the recruiter called him last minute to tell him sorry , you 're not getting in because of your past history of depression . They practically DQ 'd him . What they 're referring to is that on his endocrinology record for his thyroid history there was a doctors note stating " past diagnosis : depression and ADHD " because when he was 12 and the doctors were trying to figure out what was wrong with him , and they misdiagnosed him as having depression and ADHD . He was never treated for these things or on medication because they soon found out that it was actually his thyroid causing the symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got treated for the thyroid his symptoms dissappeared and he was fine . He personally does not feel that he has ever been depressed , he was just experiences various symptoms from the underactive thyroid . <p> The Army has no actual medical record of the depression/ADHD beyond this little note on his endorcrinology report , and to my knowledge none exists . However , through looking into it , it seems that it is very difficult to enlist with any prior history of a depression diagnosis and his recruiters told him that its non-waiverable . <p> We are now in the process of paying $500 out of pocket for my husband to see a mental health counselor next week who will give him a full mental health evaluation and report . She has done some work with a military academy before and will be able to sign a letter attesting to his mental health status and history . He is now 25 and has had ZERO mental health **29;243;TOOLONG in the past 13 years . He will also compile a timeline of his medical history showing when the misdiagnosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is : has anybody else been through this before ? Does he have any chance of enlisting if he gets a report stating the depression/ADHD was a misdiagnosis and that he is mentally healthy ? Does it help that he was only 12 and never treated for these conditions ? Is it even worth paying the $500 to get this done ? He is otherwise very physically fit , nothing else in his background , and scored a 95/99 on his ASVAB . This is his dream and he has worked very hard this past year trying to enlist . He is also willing to join in other branches besides the Army if they will take him . ANY advice on mental health issues and waiver is appreciated , or how he would go about talking to other branches as well . TIA ! <p> These are questions to ask his recruiter . No one short of Doc Brown is able to prove he was n't depressed 13 years ago . I highly doubt he 'll be able to enlist if his recruiter has already given him this information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe the reg says in the last 6 months/ current depression . If your husband had thoughts of suicide , suicide attempt , cutting , or was in therapy/ treated for more than 6 months ; he 's PDQ 'd . You 're wasting your money . No therapist will say another therapist was wrong over 13 years ago . <p> I called his recruiters today before making the psych appointment to ask if it was worth paying the $500 . His recruiters are the ones who recommended seeing the counselor in the first place . They told him that they ca n't tell him to go pay so much money out of pocket because it might not work , but that if they were him they would try and make the appointment because there is still a chance that he can enlist with a good enough letter . I am asking on here because his recruiters honestly seem to be a little lacking in knowledge on this issue , no offense to them . <p> He never had thoughts/attempts of suicide , cuting or any therapy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or really anything that he is aware of . He was 12 and his Mom overreacts and pushed for the diagnosis . We 're not even sure if it was a therapist or a doctor that diagnosed him as depression/ADHD - he has no record of it . All we know is that he was diagnosed as that and then shortly afterward they tested him and found out that his thyroid levels were low and *that* was what caused the symptoms he was experiencing ( tired , withdrawn , lethargic , etc . ) . So I would hope this therapist he goes to see can understand how depression can be misdiagnosed in an instance like that , especially because he was a child with an over-bearing Mother . After he got on thyroid meds he was better and never recieved any other treatment like therapy or anything like that . <p> What the recruiters did say was that history of depression is **25;274;TOOLONG since 2012 as I found out from my own research , and they seemed to have been unaware that it was unwaiverable until dealing with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never had an *actual* history of depression , and was just misdiagnosed , would help . <p> No therapist can say someone was n't depressed 13 years ago . A PCM has the ability to diagnose depression without a therapist 's assessment . Again , a history of depression is NOT a DQ . It 's being treated for depression ( or any behavioral health diagnosis ) for longer than 6 months is a DQ . If he was treated for longer than 6 months for a behavioral health diagnosis , he is PDQ ( no waivers ) . Again , it 's a waste of money . <p> AR 40-501 ; 2-27 d and d1 ( Google it ) <p> Note : The specifier says current NOT history . The only way HISTORY applies is if he was being treated for longer than 6 months . IF he was treated for depression for longer than 6 months , HE IS PDQ 'd . <p> ( 1 ) History of mood disorders requiring outpatient care for longer than 6 months by a physician or other mental health professional ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential facility does not meet the standard . <p> Ok , well that is helpful if that is the case . My only question would be that I had read elsewhere that any history of a diagnosis was PDQ , irregardless of treatment or how long he was treated for . All that the Army knows is that he was diagnosed with it and that was enough for them to say he was disqualified unless he was able to present some other kind of evidence from a doctor . He definitely was not treated for it for 6 months or more , so I hope that does work in his favor . As far as his records show he was n't actually treated for depression at all , there is only a mention of him being diagnosed with it . <p> In that case , do you think it would be helpful to have this therpaist write a report stating that he is mentally healthy , has no signs of depression and ADHD , and attest to the fact that hypothyroid can be misdiagnosed as depression ? If we turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health professional , plus he passes the psych at MEPs , plus there being no medical history of him ever being treated for depression . . . does that make his odds better of being able to enlist ? <p> Medical regulations have a specifier ( current , history , current and/or history ) . The specifier for depression is " current " with the caveat of being treated for longer than 6 months . <p> ... again <p> No one is questioning his CURRENT behavioral health status . <p> ... again <p> No therapist is going to say he was misdiagnosed 13 years ago ... 13 ... ; that 's the equivalent of going to a PCM and asking them to write a note saying you had the cold and not the flu 13 years ago . IT 'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN . <p> Along the same lines ; it 's not in the therapists scope of practice to say hypothyroid caused the depression 13 years ago . Even an endocrinologist would n't stick their neck out there for a 13 year old case . <p> The recruiters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules . He 's not being DQ 'd for the HISTORY of depression ; it 's something else that 's in his record that , he 's not telling you/MEPS , or he was treated ( by someone ) for depression for 6 months or longer . <p> OK thank you I googled it and its exactly as you said , history of depression is a problem if treatment was over 6 months long . He never recieved treatment . Can the standards change , or why would they tell him that it 's disqualifying for him to have this one tiny note on his records that he diagnosed with it as a 12 year old but never treated for it ? Are they just waiting to get paperwork to verify that he was never treated ala " better safe than sorry " ? <p> Sorry I just now read your response . I understand everything you are saying and agree , I just ca n't understand why he is hitting this roadblock then . You 're suggesting there is something he 's not telling me or some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding back from me some treatment he recieved because we have talked about all of this thoroughly , but I will ask him again . I have told him he should ask his recruiter about this today too ( diagnosis vs. treatment being the issue ) because he is stopping by today to pick up all the medical records they have on him so that he can bring it to the therapist next week . So I guess we should double check through it and make sure there is nothing about him treated .... but I am 99.9% sure that the only info the Army has about it is a note from the endorcrinologist saying that whichever doctor referred him listed a previous diagnosis of depression and adhd. that is it . Nothing from the original doctor about the diagnosis , no treatment , no meds , nothing . <p> Last thing : I just want to thank you for pointing all of that out , that 's a really big help . I asked my husband about it and he insisted that there was no treatment for depression/ADHD or record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office shortly to ask for his medical records and ask his recruiters why they were trying to request a medical waiver for this , and to go through his medical records together . <p> He has the feeling that they dropped the ball on this one , and hopefully they can turn it around and still get him joined up . Looking at everything you have pointed out , and I do n't see any reason he should be DQ 'd . Thank you ! <p> This is why we request that the actual applicant come on to post than a relative who will have no idea of what the applicant stated and experienced at MEPS . Also , it seems that the military is something that relatives try to help someone apply versus a civilian gig ; even though I know that networking and other forms of assistance do happen in the civilian sector . <p> Lynn , <p> You need to have your husband ask the recruiter if he is afforded some sort of appeal for his MEPS DQ . If not ; then it is what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military are not qualified in one shape or form . Good luck . <p> Hello , I am the applicant . I appreciate everyone answering my wife 's questions , I am fortunate to have her at home to do some researching when I can not ( I still work a full time job and ca n't always get away to talk with recruiters/post on message boards ) <p> What I wanted to add is this : I do n't believe I was ever DQ 'd from MEPS . In fact , the recruiter I last spoke with said he could still theoretically send me to MEPS to get checked out , but because they are n't allowed to submit any waivers for history of depression that it is not worth trying . <p> I picked up all of the records they had on me today , and the earliest records from the Endo state that I presented to their practice with symptoms of depression , fatigue and cold intolerance , and that the only medications I was on were both for treatment of hypothyroid . After that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headache .. " etc . No meds , no treatment on all subsequent records . <p> Even my pediatric records that I got ahold of from more than a decade ago state that I had symptoms such as fatigue , loss of appetite , etc. but never explicitly state that I was depressed or ever received treatment for it . I did see a therapist a couple of times as a child because I was quiet/fatigued/had difficulty focusing but this all ultimately led to a diagnosis of Hypothyroid disorder which was then treated and all those symptoms resolved . <p> Barely any " treatment " for depression ( much less 6 months ) , no hospitalization , certainly no current mood disorders of any kind and a clean bill of health from my primary physician . <p> My questions : Is the consensus that my recruiter may be mistaken in this case ? Would it be a good idea for me to try to go to MEPS if I am cleared to go , regardless of what they told me ? <p> Would love to save $500 and not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding me back . I have wanted to enlist in the military for a long time , and am determined to do so . Any help is appreciated <p> Yes sir , and it has even been accepted in the past . I traveled to MEPS a couple weeks ago with every intention of completing the physical/picking a job , but my paperwork was sadly not updated in time before they sent me up so my projection was cancelled before I arrived ( wasted trip ) . I got everything re-signed and submitted to go up the next week , but the recruiter called me a few days later to tell me what I explained above . He said I could still go but that it would n't mean anything , so he advised me to cancel . I did . Now part of me is regretting that

It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do n't get engineer ( meaning every applicant that year had an engineer degree with is not seen ) you can transfer as a CPT . If you are going to make the Army a career then you wo n't mind what i 'm about to say . The Engineer Corps , Active Duty , along with many other branches offer exciting oportunities to do something other than manage Soldiers if that is what you wish but you will not have the opportunity to choose one of these interesting career paths until you Branch qualify as a CPT . This means that until you complete your company command course at Ft Lost in the Woods and command a company , you will not be able to serve a duty station with the Corps . This being said ; you wo n't acctually be an Engineer per say . There are apx a dozen active duty Military slots per USACE district ( 500-1400 personnel ) and they are mostly leadership position . You will manage engineer ; i.e. ask them nicely to design something or review submittals but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you have and maintain a P.E . It 's a nice life in the Military because you 're usually far away from a Major instillation meaning civilians will appreciate your service because they are not used to seeing sombody in uniform and there is usually lax pt formation , the same APFT standards but you are expected to work out on your own which is a nice change from the usuall manditory 0600 ; also the civilian laid back mentality is nice and they will never deny leave you request . The flip side is , once you 've invested 7-11 years in the Miltiary you might be thinking of making Sr Officer ( IE O6 or O7 ) . You will have a hard time doing this in the Corps and need to jump between Corps tours and line unit positions to stay compeditive . The Army looks for leadership time with Soldier and considering the amount of Districts available , the pickings are slim . <p> Things to know : the Engineers consider USACE equivalant to Brigade Command but not equal . That being said , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an Engineering Degree and spent at least one tour with the Corps . <p> Also : the Active Duty Engineer 's do n't acctually conduct Engineering ( your first 7-9 years in the Army ) . At best , a Heavy Unit will have Soldiers capable of building roads or simple buildings capable of supporting Troops in the field . Sad to see but i feel like the Engineers have forgotten their roots of breaching obstacles to deal with the IED threats ; meaning regardless of what you are doing , it will be related to IEDs which ( ARE NOT OBSTACLES ) but an ambush that EVERY combat arms group should be dealing with . Right now , that 's pretty much all Engineers do . You have an Engineering Degree , you wo n't be using it in the Army but you will have the option to take tours with the Corps once you 've put in your time ( apx 7-9 years ) . <p> Oh , the civil affairs is what i 'm pursuing now and they DO need engineers . the CA provides immediate desaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and infrastructure conditions . Suprisingly there are not many in the CA so you will be valuable . Also , they provide 2-3 month deployment where you are attached to other engineering units ( combined ) and help improve their conditions which usually means awesome engineering projects since infrastructure is usually the first immediate problem . 
@@95986103 @186103/ <p> I would have to say that the hardest thing that i have seen people incounter is is someone that requires waivers for medical issues , you have to have complete documenation and medical history for the issue .

However if it does n't  pass then you can file for a review by a higher ranking doctor and if that passes then your good if not well you know . That is the most difficult thing that I have heard about . I never have though twice about the military its something I have always wanted to do ( Military Brat ) .

@@95986105 @186105/ <p> Yes , it 'll be a big deal . It MIGHT keep you out of BCT . The only two ways I can think of to overcome the fear is to work through your local mental and behavioral health professionals ... or to get over it on your own . Not so easily said than done , I realize . I have this irrational , overwhelming , and debilitating fear of horses and getting over it is REALLY hard to do . <p> As a 6 year Ironworker , i can give you some pointers for overcoming a fear of heights . Firstly , if you are going higher than you are comfortable with , make sure you have a task to perform that requires a lot of focus . The tallest building i worked on was a 32 story in downtown Dallas , TX , and working 345 ft from the side walk below is much less intimidating if you are focused on making a good weld , or drilling a bolt hole in exactly the right spot , etc . Basically by keeping your mind busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Secondly , walking across a beam up in the air is the same as walking across a beam on the ground . Fix your eyes on the next column , or point you are trying to get to , and put one foot in front of the other . A beam may bounce or wobble , but you are on top so you will move with it . What helps with that is keep your knees bent slightly , roll your feet heel to toe ( i picture a tire rolling in my mind , you want to make smooth movements ) , and move a little faster than a normal walk . Just like a bicycle , the faster you move the easier it is to balance . If the beam starts wobbling real bad , DO NOT stop . Fix your eye on the closest stable point and pick up speed a bit . <p> Thirdly , find a way to practice . If 5 feet is where you freeze up , see if a nearby playground has anything 3 feet to practice moving around on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a couple saw horses . Once you get the hang of moving , slowly start going higher vertically . Most people sound dubious about walking faster , but it really does take a lot of the instability out of moving . Keep one foot in front of the other and your eyes on where you 're trying to get to , you 'd be suprised at how well instinct works to keep something solid under your feet .

Most overuse injuries can be treated with rest , ice , compression , and elevation . The most common running injuries occur in the feet , ankles , knees , and legs . Although such injuries are hard to eliminate , there are ways to keep them to a minimum . Preventive measures include proper warm-up , cool-down and stretching exercises , and allowing enough recovery time between hard bouts of exercising . For example , several days of hard running without rest between each session can also be a major cause of injuries . Another preventative measure is to buy proper running shoes with good arch supports for the type of foot you have .

An investigation , which was initiated in 1960 , revealed that a battle streamer had never been issued to the unit . A letter was submitted to the Department of the Army requesting issue of a campaign streamer for the active duty service of the unit with the Hawaii Territorial Guard . The reply from DA was that the unit was not entitled to battle honors , rather , only the active Army personnel ( cadre and instructors ) who were on duty with the unit at the time of the attack of Pearl Harbor were entitled to the award .

In February 1961 , Senator Takahashi referred the matter to the Legislative Reference Bureau for preparation of legislation to authorize the award of a streamer of other appropriate device to the unit . On 6 July the purchase and award of a streamer to the Army ROTC Detachment , University of Hawaii , was authorized under Act 148 , Regular Session 1961 . Major General F. W.
