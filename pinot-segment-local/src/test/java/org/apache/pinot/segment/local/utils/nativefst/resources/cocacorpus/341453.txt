The animal was discovered by Alexander von Humboldt in 1812 , although there was some confusion about the description of the animal because of the various colors found across the 5 different subspecies . The primate is usually a creamy white color in front ( hence the name White-fronted Capuchin ) , although the area that is " white " in the front can range from a creamy white color to a cinnamon brown color depending on the subspecies .

@@25392900 @5392900/ <h> Amphibians <h> What are amphibians <p> The word amphibian means two lives . This is very fitting for most amphibians , as they spend part of their lives in water and part of their lives on land . Frogs , for instance , lay their eggs in water which then hatch into tadpoles . The tadpole looks more like a fish than a frog . It has only a tail -- no arms or legs -- and swims through the water . As the tadpole ages , it develops arms and legs while the size of its tail shrinks . When the tadpole , now a frog , is old enough , it leaves the water and spends the rest of its life on land . This process of change is called metamorphosis . <p> Amphibians are divided into three main categories : caecilians , salamanders , and frogs or toads . Amphibians are similar to reptiles , except amphibians have scaleless , moist skin . Most amphibians are very small , less than 2 inches long . There are exceptions , however . For instance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 5 feet long ! <h> Where do amphibians live <p> Amphibians are found on all corners of the globe . They live everywhere except Antarctica . Amphibians usually live near sources of water or other moist areas . This is because an amphibian has to stay moist or else it may dry out . Some amphibians , however , are able to live in dry places and accomplish this feat by living in underground collections of water , staying there for weeks or even months . <h> How is each type of amphibian different ? <p> Frogs and toads are creatures you are probably familiar with . They have short front arms and long back legs that help them move around by hopping . Frogs tend to be slippier than the rougher toads and also have longer legs . You may have heard that toads give you warts but this is not true . There are about 2,700 types of frogs and toads . <p> Salamanders look similar to lizards , but they have no scales . Their skin is slick and moist like most other amphibians . Salamanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most common in Central and South America . There are about 330 types of salamanders . <p> Caecilians have no arms or legs . They look like big worms or small snakes . They live in tropical regions such as Southeast Asia , India , and some parts of Africa . They are most commonly found in South America . There are about 150 species of caecilians . <h> What do amphibians eat ? <p> Amphibians usually eat insects and are important in maintaining the balance of nature . Without amphibians , there would be way too many insects . Some larger amphibians , such as bullfrogs , may also eat snakes , birds or other small animals . Amphibians are eaten by snakes , mammals , birds , other amphibians , and even people . Amphibian larvae such as tadpoles live off a diet of algae and may be eaten by water creatures such as fish or turtles . <h> How did amphibians evolve ? <p> Amphibians have been around for over 350 million years . Scientists suppose that amphibians may have been some of the first land creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobe-finned fish . These fish had lungs that allowed them to move on land for short periods of time and fins that worked much like legs . It is very likely that these fins became legs through many generations of natural selection . <h> Conclusion <p> Amphibians are amazing creatures that play a very important part in our ecosystem . They come in many shapes , sizes and colors . Most importantly , they need moist , humid areas to survive . Unfortunately , humans are destroying many of these environments and putting these creatures at risk . Because amphibians are so delicate , they need our protection and respect .

However , the less common name ' jumping-shrew ' did not come about because the animals jumps or hops about in anyway . <p> All elephant-shrews are quadrupedal , meaning that they walk on four feet . The name jumping-shrew developed because of the striking appearance of the short-eared elephant-shrews ' long rear legs . These crooked legs led some to believe that the elephant-shrews launch with them . While elephant-shrews are predominantly not jumpers , there is an exception . The checkered elephant shrew , one of the swiftest runners among all elephant-shrews , can generate enough power with the hind legs to leap as high as 3 feet . <p> Proper classification of the elephant-shrews proved elusive for quite some time . In the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the shrews and the hedgehogs . During other periods , the science community grouped them together with tree shrews , included them in the order of Lagomorpha , along with hares and rabbits , and even regarded them as distant relatives of the ungulates , of which the llama belongs . <p> However , modern evidence strongly supports the current placement that the elephant-shrew is a member of the superorder Afrotheria . Afrotheria is a clade of mammals that includes aardvarks , elephants , golden moles , hyraxes , sea cows , sengis ( elephant-shrews ) , and tenrecs . It is quite remarkable and interesting to note that the elephant-shrew has more than a fancied connection to the elephant . With this modern classification , it became common to use the name ' sengi ' and to use hyphens in elephant-shrew and jumping-shrew in order to distinguish these animals from the shrew . <p> One of the other remarkable aspects of the elephant-shrew is that some members of the family are living fossils . Scientists use the term ' living fossil ' to describe species that have lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is as much as tens of millions of years . For instance , the short-eared elephant-shrew has changed very little from its ancestor that flourished on the African continent some 30 million years ago . <p> Like their ancestors , the elephant-shrews are an insectivorous mammal , which means that they are a carnivore with a diet consisting almost entirely of insects and other similar small creatures . The short-eared elephant-shrew , the most common of all elephant-shrews , grows to an average weight of 40g or approximately 1.4 ounces . They reach an average length of 23 cm , which is approximately 9 inches . However , the tail comprises more than half of this length , reaching 12 cm or 4.7 inches . <p> Elephant-shrews do not exist outside the continent of Africa and most of the species live south of the Sahara Desert . One notable exception , the Elephantulus rozeti , prefers semi-arid habitats so lives in areas of North Africa such as Algeria and Marocco . Other species to habitat relationships are the Elephantulus in the savannas , Rhynchocyon in lowland forests and mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undergrowth of central Africa and its east coast . <p> The primary predator of the elephant-shrew is the human who use it as a source of food . However , the most serious threat to the elephant-shrew is that there habitats are distributed in highly fragmented forest areas . This keeps the population relatively low because it 's often difficult for the animal to move to an area where potential mates and resources are more abundant .

Although , Liberia still has a swath of suitable habitat for zebra duikers , it is believed that in other areas , the little antelope 's population will continue to fall and that its status will eventually decline to Endangered or Critically Endangered .

Norway lemmings are generally 13 to 15 centimeters ( about 5 to 6 inches ) , with an added tail length of 2 centimeters ( 0.8 inch ) , and range in weight from 28 grams to 113 grams ( 1 to 4 ounces ) . <p> Besides its namesake country of Norway , these lemmings are found in Sweden , Finland , Western Russia , and a number of islands outlying from these countries . They live in a number of habitats , including grasslands , shrubs , and occasionally wetlands . They are fully comfortable in snow , and during the winter , tunnel along the ground underneath the snow in order to find food and shelter .

While all lemmings experience periodic population explosions , Norway lemmings are the only species that migrates as a result .

Other consequences of the industrial organization of our agriculture are not at all discussed or just perceived peripherally . One of these issues is the fact that not only domestic animals , serving us with their meat , milk and eggs , are affected , but also wild living animals suffer from the changes in agriculture . The Griffon vulture is an example for these species .

But there have n't been hunting wolves and bears in our cultivated landscapes for quite a while now and Griffon vultures had to find other sources of nutrition . Animals perished in forest areas were out of question , since they are hard to detect from above . Open areas are more suitable and so the traditional pastural agriculture served as a good alternative .

What makes this order so unique is that in addition to the animals in it being marsupials , they are omnivores . They exhibit a relationship to both the herbivorous and carnivorous marsupials to which they are less closely related . <p> To illustrate , they have fused second and third toes , otherwise known as syndactyly . Their connected toes can only be distinguished by the nails growing from each one . This is typically a characteristic of herbivorous marsupials such as opossums and kangaroos . At the same time , the way the peramelemoid 's teeth grow suggests a relationship with carnivorous marsupials because they have multiple pairs of incisors , as opposed to the sole pair herbivorous marsupials have . This is known as being polyprotodont . The peramelemorph 's teeth are , however , flatter and less pointed than a true carnivorous marsupial 's .

Indeed , the island , somewhat indirectly , is named for the presence of quokkas . In 1696 , an early explorer of Western Australia ( then New Holland ) , the Dutch sea captain - Willem de Vlamingh , considered the quokkas to be vermin and named the island ' Rottnest ' , which is Dutch for ' rat nest ' .

On the mainland the quokka are sympatric with Gilbert 's Potoroo , another marsupial , sometimes called a rat-kangaroo . <p> Quokkas are mainly nocturnal and exclusively herbivorous , feeding on grasses and leaves . However , they are thought to be able to survive for extended periods without any food or water . The Rottnest population is thought to have suffered a certain degree of i 'll health due to being fed inappropriate food-stuffs by tourists , including bread .

Such caecotrophy is common in the animal kingdom and is practiced by many other mammals , including rabbits . It allows for the re-processing of any material that has made its way through the entirety of the animal 's digestive system without being fully digested . Such coprophagous behaviour can be expected to be most common during times of low food abundance or extremely high physiological demand ( e.g. during pregnancy and/or lactation ) . <p> Picture of the Quokka on Rottnest Island WA Australia 2008 , by Gavin Williams , licensed under GFDL

Their foot long ( 30.48 cm ) bodies are very round with comparatively tiny feet and a long , silky tail an additional 5 to 6 inches ( 12.7 to 15.2 cm ) long . Their heads are more rabbit-like than guinea pig-like with pleasantly prominent ears that are rounded at the tips . Despite their chubby appearance , the largest chins only weigh 2 pounds ( 0.91 kg . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silver grey with pale bellies . But domesticated chinchillas come in a variety of colors , including albino , white ( with dark eyes ) beige , shades of black and a brown-grey shade called lavender . Chinchillas must bathe in dust because the coat takes such a long time to dry that the animal could catch pneumonia . <p> In the Andes Mountains , rain is rare and so the animals evolved to not rely on it . <p> Behavior <p> In the wild , chinchillas live in small colonies and eat grass , lichens , seeds and occasionally dead insects . Like any other rodent , chinchilla 's front teeth grow continuously throughout their lives in order to accommodate for their hard diet . In captivity , chinchillas need to eat hard foods and be given chew toys so their teeth do not grow too long . <p> After a gestation of around 112 days , chinchilla babies are born fully furred with their eyes open and their teeth grown in . They can soon walk after birth and follow after their parents . Both parents help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the work . Babies are weaned when they are two months old . They become sexually mature by the time they are eight months old . Living in small colonies means that there are many eyes working together to look out for predators . The chinchilla 's main form of defense is their speed . Despite their comical appearances , chinchillas can sprint in amazingly quick bursts of speed . They rarely run in a straight line but zig-zag and leap to out-maneuver natural predators such as birds of prey . <p> The Chinchilla Today <p> Long-tailed chinchillas are one of the rarest mammals to be found in the Andean mountains . Hunting them became outlawed by 1918 , although poaching does occur . In the early 1900s , 12 chinchillas , nine males and three females , were brought to the United States by an ex-miner named Matthias F. Chapman . All pet chinchillas in North America are descended from 11 of these 12 . One chinchilla turned out to be too old to breed . There are chinchilla farms in many countries of the world where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Chinchillas are remarkably long-lived for rodents . Those in captivity have lived as long as 20 years , although the world record holder lived a whopping 26 years . In the wild , their lifespans are considerably shorter but animals living to 15 have been recorded .

In all species the number of digits is reduced at least by the loss of the first digit , and the second and fifth digits are small in many . The third and fourth digits , however , remain large and bear weight in all artiodactyls . This pattern has earned them their name , Artiodactyla , which means " even-toed .

They have prominent , pointed ears with a tuft of black hair at the tip . Females average 20 pounds and males weigh from 16 to 30 pounds . They breed in late winter or early spring and have a gestation period of about two months . A female may have one to six kittens each year . Although adapted to a variety of habitats across the country , they do not tolerate the deep snows found in much of Yellowstone , and thus they are usually reported in the northern portion of the park . Bobcats move about their home ranges most actively in the hours near dawn and dusk , hunting small mammals such as mice , rabbits , hares , and deer .

@@25393383 @5393383/ <h> Animals that fly <p> One of the most majestic sights to behold is to watch an eagle lift its wings and take flight . Watching the giant bird soar through the air causes one to ask , " How do they do it ? " The mechanics of flight are simple , actually . An animal must possess wing to fly , but not all birds fly . A bird 's wings are covered in feathers , and these feathers have a unique design . They are made of a strong material called keratin , and are hollow in the middle to create a light , aerodynamic wing . The tail is the rudder , helping the bird direct its ' path . The tail also helps the bird balance in the air , with a stablizing effect as it spreads . <p> You might wonder , " but how does a bird actually fly ? " The process of becoming airborne is made up of three steps . First , a bird must gain speed for take-off . Birds eat high-calorie foods that give them the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called an " airfoil " , lifting the bird from the ground to keep it aloft . This happens when air goes below and above the wings , with the air at the top of the wing going at a faster speed than the bottom of the wing . Third , the bird flaps its ' wings to create " thrust " or upward push from the ground . Birds know instinctively how to turn their wings to create the most thrust . <p> Birds are not the only creatures who fly . Bats , a form of flying mammal , also fly . If you have ever seen a bat fly , you will notice its erratic flight pattern and moth-like appearance in the air . This is because bats are designed to be versatile in the air , changing directions when necessary . And , unlike birds , bats have heavier bones close to their bodies for added support , and lighter bones toward the wing tips to help lighten the load . <p> In addition to bats and birds , there are also many varieties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wings by nerve command . They actually only require nerve commands to start and stop the process of flight . But insects are similar to birds in that they must burn calories effectively , using carbohydrates to maintain the enormous job of staying aloft .
