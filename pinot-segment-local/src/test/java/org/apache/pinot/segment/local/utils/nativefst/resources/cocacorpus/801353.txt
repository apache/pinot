 nez celebrates his 30th stage anniversary with a new show <p> In his jubilee year , 2012 , the mime actor Carlos Mart ? nez looks back over thirty intense years on the stage . His premiere performance as a mime took place in 1982 in a youth club in Barcelona ; and his repertoire consisted at that time of six mime pieces . <p> Today , that young theatre buff has become a master of his profession , someone with whom not only advanced mime students and actors study , but who business managers , teachers and theologians consult in order to understand more fully body language and nonverbal communication . From his initial programme of six mime pieces , Carlos Mart ? nez has gone on to produce six full-length shows , has performed in over thirty countries in countless theatres , public halls and even convention centres with several thousand participants . His timeless art that relies entirely on the imagination of the viewer , enchants young and old . His humanity and his humour inspire and reach across all levels of society . Some pieces like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classics . <p> Carlos Mart ? nez is the laureate of the 2002 prize awarded by the German foundation " Bibel und Kultur " and his shows have been the " audience choice " in two theatre festivals in Portugal : Almada in 2004 with " Hand Made " and in 2009 with his programme " Books without Words " . <p> Throughout all these years Carlos Mart ? nez has remained faithful to his own mime identity : the austerity of black clothing , white gloves and white makeup that turns the actor 's face into a neutral canvas on which he can project a range of emotions . He loves the woodcut style , this minimalistic form of expression that does not use any props . His measured movements , simple gestures and facial expression allow him to portray characters rich in nuance ; all the while revelling in our human inconsistencies and contradictions . Whereas in the past it took a mere 15 minutes for the mime to apply his makeup , nowadays he takes a full hour to complete the process . However it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of each programme , in front of his audience , in order to say a few words to them . <p> The process of applying his makeup is both ritual and mental preparation for the stage . The intimacy of the dressing room , where the mime sits alone in front of the mirror , inspired his book " From the Dressing Room " , which was initially published in 2009 in German ( " " ) , and since , in 2011 , in English and Spanish ( " Desde el camerino " ) . Asked about getting older the actor says : " The art does not get older , however , the artist does . What is interesting is that , the older the actor becomes , the closer he grows to his art . And that in return keeps him young . " <p> For his 30th stage anniversary Carlos Mart ? nez has worked on a new show , " Mirage " , which he performs in combination with all time audience favourites . Inspired by the discussion around climate change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his home country of Spain , the programme refers to our most precious and most natural resource : water . And as in previous programs , in " Mirage " the actor leaves both the interpretation of the images he paints in the spectators ' minds and the conclusions they reach , up to the imagination of each person . <p> As the show begins we see how a man loses his way in the desert . His canteen is almost empty . His cell phone battery is running low and anyway there 's no coverage . As his growing thirst and tedium lead to delirium , he begins to see illusive images of water : one mirage after another . The water he has taken for granted , appears to him in the desert as the miracle of turning on the tap , the sound of waves at a beach , a well , a public toilet ... Water , water everywhere , but not a drop to drink . How will he survive ? <p> Without props , wardrobe changes or voice , alone on an empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert of his own . With only movements to evoke stories in the imagination of an audience , all mime is mirage , creating life from gesture , life which arises from the pure physicality of dramatic ( and comic ) events . <p> Carlos Martinez offers us yet another chance to discover the reflection of our humanity in Mirage ! <p> Mirage opens in Switzerland at the Kulturhalle Gl ? , W ? on 14th January 2012 and in Germany at the Kabarett der , Esslingen on 2nd February 2012 . <p> Carlos Mart ? nez is offering his audience this very personal contribution to the many actions taking place during the Water for Life Decade ( **30;456;TOOLONG ) . <p> Born in Asturias , Spain , Carlos Mart ? nez moved to Barcelona and put his passion to work by training at the dramatic arts schools , Taller de Mimo y Teatro Contemporaneo and El Timbal . The positive feedback from his first solo performances , in 1982 , confirmed his decision to live from the theatre . And because he is not dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and around the world . <p> His show Hand Made was the audience choice at the XXI Almada Theatre Festival in Portugal . Programs such as Human Rights have toured extensively including a month-long tour of Switzerland under the sponsorship of Amnesty International . In 2006 , Carlos Mart ? nez performed at the AI awards ceremony in the Deutsches Theater in Berlin . With Time To Celebrate he celebrated in 2007 his 25th stage anniversary as a mime actor in many European countries . <p> He teaches master classes for universities and acting schools , such as the Scuola Dimitri ( Switzerland ) , and is a speaker at corporate seminars on the topics of non-verbal communication and body language . Carlos Mart ? nez is constantly moving the boundaries of silence in an imaginative world that combines his Mediterranean spirit and humour with precise technique and rhythm . <h> More Releases from is really fantastic ! <h> Rishika Singh goes 
 Rajasthan - National Youth Day 2012 <p> Swami Vivekananda is great as he is undoubtedly the one who harmonized the East and the West , Religion and Science , Past and Present . <p> The birthday of Swami Vivekananda who was born on January 12 , 1863 and became immortal on July 4 , 1902 is observed all over India as National Youth Day . A quote attributed to Nobel Laureate Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore goes as " If you want to know India , study Vivekananda " . <p> He played a stellar role in ending India 's cultural isolation from the rest of the world thus becoming India 's first great cultural ambassador to the West . As much as he wanted the westerners to learn spirituality from the Indians , he wanted Indians to learn from westerners not only science and technology but also humanism by adopting ideas of individual freedom , social equality and justice and respect for women . <p> He was the one who brought out that religion which is indeed the Science of Consciousness is as scientific as science itself and established that religion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> His concept of potential divinity of the soul gave a new approach of spiritual humanism to prevent societal degradation and make life meaningful and worth living . He gave a new theory of ethics and new principle of morality based on the intrinsic purity and oneness of the soul . The Harvard philosopher William James called Swami Vivekananda as the " paragon of Vedantists . " <p> Beyond doubt the five ingredients to be successful are Positive Attitude , Clear Objectives , Faith in Action , Creative Vision &amp; Team Work . The relevance of Swami Vivekananda for an educational institution is best understood by the quote of Swamiji " We want that Education , by which Character is Formed , Strength of Mind is Increased , the Intellect is Expanded , and by which one can stand on one 's own feet . " <p> On this occasion , on 12 Jan 2012 Prof BR Natarajan Pro Vice Chancellor addressing the faculty of Shridhar University in the Lecture Theatre shared the above details and urged them to take inspiration from the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Considering that Shridhar University within a short span of time has attracted students not only from Rajasthan but also from various states of India which include Assam , Tripura , West Bengal , Jharkhand , Orissa , Bihar , Uttar Pradesh , Delhi , Punjab , Haryana , Himachal Pradesh , Jammu &amp; Kashmir , Maharashtra , Gujarat and Uttarakhand , Prof pointed that every festival at the university is indeed celebrating diversity in Unity . <p> Later in the evening Prof Natarajan and Prof Tarun Roy Choudhury took a team of Shridhar University students to Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Smriti Mandir and interacted with Swami for involving faculty and students in various voluntary social activities and school reach programs . <p> About Shridhar University : An initiative of the Trust , Shridhar University Pilani has been established under Section 2(f) of UGC Act 1956 incorporated by Government of Rajasthan vide Ordinance No. 3 of 2009 and the same ratified by the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly vide Act No. 4 of 2010 as The UNIVERSITY ACT , .

 Porsche 996 Carrera Turbo to Gains <p> Vivid Racing has been doing prototypes for Porsche 996 Carrera Turbo upgrades for over a year . Some have even gone on 997 Carrera models as well . Their kit gave this 2001 Porsche 996 the boost it needed to reach gains . The features installed were an air to air intercooler , Turbosmart wastegate and boost controller , equal length header and muffler pipes , and carbon fiber work . For this car , a Garrett GT35R with a .82ar using the Tial V-Band housing was added . The Garrett based turbo is more linear in how it boosts compared to the Precision . The power does not hit as hard , so it gives it more of a supercharger like feel . Running the engine at a safe 5.5psi , the driveability through the gears is comfortable and the car roars when the wastegate opens . Comparatively , they make the same gain between each turbo . The final factor , of course , is the tuning . <p> With months of testing , Softronic and Vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give the car proper idle , partial throttle , and wide open throttle . Having developed the kit on the platform , the only downfall with the C2 and C4 is the turbo kit hanging lower then the stock bumper . To get the equal length and well balanced system , this was the optimal position for the parts . The good thing is any aftermarket Turbo style bumper will hide these right up . These high quality and well engineered parts on this kit promise to show proper reliable street and track performance for vehicle longevity . <p> Vivid Racing is a multi-million dollar small business in the automotive aftermarket industry .

 K ? gel sets new standards in the field of pneumatic tarpaulin interlocking with the new quick opening mechanism . With its intelligent combination of frame and closing technology , the system allows reduction of handling time for opening and closing . In comparison with the conventional closing system of a trailer with DIN EN 12642 Code XL certification , the closing and opening times of the side tarpaulins are reduced considerably . The driver and the transport company are thus able to meet the requirements of the automotive and beverage industries for shorter loading times . <p> Engineering skill at K ? gel makes this possible in less than 30 seconds drawing the tarpaulin , tensioning with the winding shaft and the locking points close automatically via rotary switch . Opening is achieved in 36 seconds and takes place in reverse order , just the winding shaft needs to be released before actuating the switch . <p> K ? gel relies on 19 clamping units per side , for better sealing between the framework and the tarpaulin , in contrast to the competition . The hooks are standard commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept : Opening and closing possible both pneumatically and conventionally . In addition , for partial loading and unloading , the front and rear sections can be opened simply by hand in the normal way . Also , this means that a de-coupled trailer with de-pressurised air receiver remains available for use . K ? gel uses a standard tarpaulin for the new quick opening mechanism . This takes up only 1.90 metres in the closed condition . This means that the K ? gel Cargo Trailer with quick opening mechanism has a through-loading width of over eleven metres . The new K ? gel quick closing system is also certified in accordance with DIN EN 12642 Code XL , including beverages . With loads this means that additional is unnecessary , and this saves time as well . For use in the automotive sector , the K ? gel quick opening mechanism meets the requirements of the Daimler Guideline for 9.5 . <p> " In the development of the new K ? gel quick opening mechanism , our top aim was to significantly increase transport efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Production at K ? gel . " We have achieved this with our 36 seconds for opening and less than 30 seconds for closing the side tarpaulin . " <p> The new K ? gel quick opening mechanism is available immediately for the K ? gel Cargo and we anticipate it being available for the K ? gel Mega in the autumn , and will have an outstanding price to performance ratio . <p> K ? gel , a brand with a tradition going back more than 75 years , and which has achieved first place throughout Europe , is once again at the centre of things with their unmistakable experience and competence . With the takeover of K ? gel in 2009 , Ulrich assumed an active entrepreneurial role which gave the brand the stability and continuity it deserves . This is further consolidated by the very sturdy equity ratio that Ulrich has made available to his companies . K ? gel has reinvented itself by returning to the strengths which formerly made the company great : A passion for transport . Quality characterised by engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings relevant customer value . And the reliability of an owner-led family company with long-term perspectives .

 it Easy to Save Energy <p> A new Energy Monitor App enables utilities to provide their consumers with a complete overview of their home energy consumption and increase their energy awareness which in overall terms should result in energy savings within the consumer 's own four walls . Thus , the App can form part of the utilities ' energy-saving efforts and support the EU 20-20-20 targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by , increasing the share of renewables in the energy consumption by and improving energy efficiency by by 2020 . <p> The Energy Monitor App is developed by Smart to empower consumers in harmony with the message delivered by EU Commissioner for Climate , Connie Hedegaard , on the 19th World Congress Hong Kong , 4 May 2011 : " Consumers play a crucial role in defining our consumption patterns and can in that way also contribute to the fight against climate change . " <p> With the App , utilities can offer their consumers the complete overview of their home energy consumption . The consumer can graphically follow his energy consumption anytime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the consumption or even reduce it for the benefit of the environment . <p> The App automatically collects new data , and the consumer can therefore follow his daily , weekly , monthly and yearly energy consumption anytime , anywhere and compare the consumption of up to three years . At the same time , he can see his standby consumption , i.e. he can overview the total kWh costs of not switching off the TV or the computer at the mains when not using them as well as the costs of the old refrigerator . This results in increased consumer energy awareness and provides them an incentive to make energy saving choices when e.g. investing in a new refrigerator . <p> As an extra feature , the utilities can communicate directly with their consumers via the App as they can send out information about news , grid breakdowns , energy saving tips and tricks , energy prices on various times of the day etc .

 SOFC single cell power density is important for various applications . Cell development requires accurate assignment of material parameters and electrochemical characteristics ; and also benchmarking of different manufacturing technologies and suppliers needs simple test equipment that ensures reproducible test setups . In this regard , special emphasis is put on the gas-tight mechanical mounting including the essential gas supply and electrical connection of a MEA . Managing these important factors is guaranteed by so-called cell housings . <p> Mainly , cell housings are designed for tests and measurements at different planar fuel cell types , such as ESC , ASC and MSC . Electrolyte supported cells already have a high performance and good redox stability , anode supported cells ( ASC ) at higher performance still lack redox stability . Metal supported cells ( MSC ) are still under development but already feature positive redox stability and optimum characteristics for thermal cycling . Research and evaluation of these parameters play a decisive role in pushing forward market access of products using SOFC technologies . <p> With the development of the full-ceramic , responds to the demand of easy-to-handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of ceramics as sole material eliminates negative impact on cell performance , for example through chrome contamination , and together with the perfected sealing concept of the ceramic surfaces , allow a simple test setup as well as the best fuel and oxygen supply . Doing so , optimum conditions for reproducible cell performance testing can be achieved . The non-destructive concept of cell integration allows the application of various post mortem analysis methods . <p> The cell housing is applicable for an active cell surface of 5x5 cm2 . By using special adapter frames differing cell thickness of ASC and ESC can be compensated individually so that every cell can exactly be positioned in the housing . Varying thickness of electrodes can be balanced by application of nickel or platinum nets . <p> By applying an innovative compression system the is also suitable for tests with varying compression forces . Through the balanced compression distribution in the cell housing compression conditions similar to a stack can be simulated on a single cell . The cell housing can be used with all MEA test stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program libraries are already available . Thus , offers innovative solutions for short-term tests , material screening , long-term test and in-line quality management for all requirements of SOFC fuel cell technologies . <p> The development of the cell housing was carried out in close collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems IKTS . <p> Let yourself be convinced by the quality of our products and solutions and meet us from June 26-29 , 2012 at the 10th European SOFC Forum at the Culture and Convention Center Lucerne , Switzerland ( booth B14 ) . <p> About : <p> Consequently intelligent : that 's how we love solutions . is the global leading supplier of test and diagnostic systems for fuel cells and batteries .

 was made to convert Delphi code to C++ . The extended C++ of the CBuilder compiler was the primary target of the first version of , which was published three months ago . With the new update this limitation is overcome , because optionally Delphi properties can be eliminated now . <p> The use of " properties " is a fundamental language feature of Delphi , that makes it difficult to translate it to C++ . Only in the special has a counterpart for this feature . The new version of can eliminate these properties automatically . They can optionally be replaced by couples of functions : one function for reading the property and another function for writing the property . Depending on the kind of access to a property , it is replaced by the one or the other function in the code .

With the translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C++ code . In Delphi the notation of an identifier does n't matter , in C++ however , the identifiers are case sensitive . Till now , the notation found by chance first was taken as a standard notation . By means of the translation tables desired notations can be fixed from the beginning . In addition , it is possible with these tables to rename identifiers completely , so that e.g. the calls of special Delphi functions are replaced by calls of C++ functions named differently . <p> Finally the quality of the translation result is increased considerably in 1.2.0 compared with the first version of this program . Still a manual post-processing of the generated C++ code can be required now and then . For the code generated with the current version , however , such cases are much rarer than before . <h> More Releases from good that exists ! <h> Feedback <h> Atul

 First Development Platform for OTX <p> Open Diagnostic Framework ? OTX and ODX based development platform for vehicle diagnostics <p> Stuttgart , 23/02/2010 The new version of the Open Diagnostic Framework ( ODF ) , presented by emotive GmbH , is the first available development environment based on OTX that can be used for graphical design , test , and execution of vehicle diagnostic sequences . <p> OTX ( Open Test sequence eXchange ISO 13209 ) is a new vehicle diagnostics standard initiated by Daimler AG that enables the user to graphically design and execute diagnostic sequences . In addition to the well-established standards and MVCI ( ASAM ) the user is not only able to simply create process-safe and exchangeable complex diagnostic sequences ; in fact , complete tester applications can now be included into the process . Just imagine : A complete tester application including all its necessary data is being created generically from an XML database . This application is not only ergonomically designed but it is stable , with good performance , and much less inexpensive than traditional solutions . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution is not impossible . Here , the user can graphically create his diagnostic sequences and test them against real ECUs or an in-built simulation , even using the debugger . The results are traced automatically . For user input and output one may design graphical user interfaces and bind them to the diagnostic sequences . All this can be packaged as a stand-alone distributable windows application ( *. exe ) to be shipped to customers as a tester application . The developer does not even have to write a single line of source code and the complexity of the underlying standards is hidden to him . <p> The emotive GmbH offers free webcasts on its website to provide a quick and comprehensive overview of the ODF 's architecture and its practical usability . <p> The company emotive GmbH was founded in 2008 and is tool manufacturer and specialist in the field of vehicle communication . The company provides its customers with software tools and engineering services by the means of trainings and consulting in the field of vehicle diagnostics .@@1397040 <h> Tarantismo : The

 Dannemann , who is over eighty years old today , does not like to make a fuss about himself . If management and employees of ABAS Software AG talk about him they always do so with utmost respect . He always focuses on what is important and is valued for his talent to explain complicated issues in a compact and comprehensible way . His trademarks are quick , well-founded decisions . This is why he is still involved in the financial controlling of ABAS Software AG . <p> Mr. Dannemann himself always describes his life very matter-of-factly , " I went through three job developments , actually four if you include my studies . At first , I completed the two study courses Mechanical Engineering and Economics at the Technische Hochschule ( technical college ) in Karlsruhe . Then I got a job and thirdly , I worked as a management consultant . Finally , I founded a company . This involves a certain consistence . " <p> In the mid-70s , Mr. Dannemann was reorganizing companies on behalf of a bank as a management consultant . In doing so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hardware providers was growing constantly . As a logical conclusion , due to his previous jobs , Mr. Dannemann had a financial basis to finance the development of the software that he wanted . <p> " In the sixties and seventies , software was developed with customers . This means , customers supported the development financially . This was already over by the time we started in 1980 . Customers only bought software that was available . Of course , this can not be compared to ERP software these days , with everything out of the box . Today , a software has to be almost perfect . In 1980 , certain things had to be available and in 1960 nothing had to be available at all . This was the development , " remembers Mr. Dannemann . <p> As a man of action he involved a freelancer who was to create executable rapid prototypes for a modern software which was adapted to PCs . They formed the basis for the current ABAS Business Software at the end of the 1970s . Reinhard Harms was the developer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software " . Mr. Harms reports , " In 1979 I was working at the University of Karlsruhe as a research assistant . My first programming course at a US high school , where I spent a year prior to my university-entrance diploma as an exchange student , really fascinated me . Thanks to this exchange organization , just after my Computer Sciences studies , I became acquainted with a family , whose father was a management consultant . At a barbecue cook out , right at the campfire in his backyard , Wolfgang Dannemann Sr. sat next to me and said the words : ' You are a computer scientist , maybe you could do me a favor . ' According to him , the software using which production companies are managed could be much better . If I wanted to look for a PC that could handle a task like this . With a sausage in my hand I had to admit my ignorance of business processes . However , Mr. Dannemann remained unimpressed by this obstacle . ' That does n't matter , simply go through some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate . I will pay your hours . What are you doing next Sunday ? My wife will make some tea and then we can talk about it in more detail . ' - Who could say no to this ? " <p> The software was developed and went on sale in 1986 . The journey brought two companies together . ? We , Systems 3 , were never really interested in getting into sales . When I started I was only interested in how the product had to be in order to survive on the market . I never really thought about sales . I realized that we would never be able to exist as System 3 in the long run because we did n't sell . Here the synthesis with the former ABAS GmbH resulted - we needed their sales know-how to successfully bring the software on the market . Some employees of System 3 and ABAS already knew each other from their studies so that a cooperation was just natural , " says Mr. Dannemann . <p> Therefore , today 's ABAS Software AG actually has two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize his dream of a software which is independent of hardware providers , and ABAS GmbH , which made this dream come true through its sales know-how . Before meeting System 3 , ABAS GmbH was mainly doing contract programming in many fields of business , from research projects at the Karlsruhe Research Center to software development using PCs , NCR , Wang and computers . The idea to develop a standard package was also contemplated here early on , realization , however , was never consequently addressed due to the flourishing daily business , as was done at System 3 . When ABAS got to know the solution by System 3 , its quality and development status really impressed people at abas . In 1984 , ABAS started to sell . In 1989 , the two companies became one .

 announce new electronic signature pad <p> long-term hardware partner Wacom has announced the launch of the new Color . It will be the third device in its range of electronic signature pads and the first one with a color display . The tablet with the technical term " Wacom " combines excellent signature capturing with excellent communication options . Below the display is the familiar Wacom sensor-technology which allows capturing signature signals with unparalleled accuracy . The high-res display may show detailed content related to the signing process like terms and conditions . While not in use for a signing procedure it acts as a customer information display for all sorts of images - whether it is an advertisement or a dedicated offer for the specific customer type . The Color is set to provide an enjoyable and highly reliable experience of customer interaction in financial institutions , in rental stations , at the point of sale and many more locations . <p> Much more than just a Signature Capturing Device <p> Ralph Maute , Product Manager Electronic Signatures : " Our customers plan to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several reasons why they are willing to pay more for an electronic signature pad with a color LC display than for one with black and white if it comes with the durability based on are known for . They like the idea of seeing their brand identity reflected in the same color on screen - whether it is just the logo or the design of screen advertisements . Hence it 's a pad that is embraced by the IT and the marketing department of customers . " <p> The very sharp color display with WVGA resolution supports the gradual move from paper-based processes to an electronic workflow as it allows to display electronic forms which look very similar to forms that users got used for a long time on paper - whether it is a receipt in a shop , a form for cash withdrawal , a contract for telecommunication or to hire a vehicle . <p> are developed based on Softpro 's Know-How <p> Alain Sarraf , Chief Technology Officer : " We are confident that the Color will change the way our customers think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a very exciting device that is the first truly reliable and technologically advanced color signature pad on the market . A few years ago we worked closely with our partner Wacom to develop the hugely successful first generation ( also known as Wacom STU-500 ) . From the start , we put tremendous value on ensuring that both our and software was tuned to function optimally and take advantage of the device 's advanced capabilities beyond the basic SDK . We have continued that tradition with this next generation device and are looking forward to providing outstanding value in our software and hardware offerings . " <p> Today the is a pad which is a frequent sight in financial institutions , at the POS of telecommunication companies , furniture retailers or fashion stores . It even is the preferred choice for capturing signatures for I 'd cards . continues : " Wacom has proven with its first two electronic signature pads that they are able to provide the market with products that supersede the initial expectations and the Color will exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leading forensic experts partnering with Softpro Wacom 's technology offers by far the highest quality for signature capturing . Due to its electromagnetic digitizer , the signer 's hand can comfortably rest on the tablet surface without affecting the signature quality thus significantly improving the ergonomics of the signing process compared to other solutions . offer a very reliable , calibrated and evenly spread capturing of pressure levels without interpolation . <p> 's E-Signing Products allow to make the most of <p> 's software is designed to make full use of the capabilities of the Color ( Wacom ) as with the ( Wacom STU-500 ) and SignPad Compact ( Wacom ) . <p> For all those seeking a solution to sign electronic documents SignDoc is the preferred choice . For those seeking to integrate the capability of capturing and verifying digitized handwritten signatures only Softpro 's Development Kit ( SDK ) contains several features which make superior to the basic SDK provided by Wacom . <p> - The quality of captured signature data using is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be converted to the ISO interchange format for signature sign time series data ( ISO/IEC 19794-7 ) . - For an even more realistic display of signatures contains an optimized rendering . Hence they like they were written on paper . - Signatures can be verified automatically whether straight after the signing procedure or at a later point of time if the authenticity of the signature is in doubt - For every signer a unique reference data set may be created in . The recorded time signals ( t ) contain characteristics of the static image of the signature ( location x and y ) together with invisible dynamic ( biometric ) signals - pressure levels ( z ) and velocity ( v ) . - Last , but not least : The user navigation on screen is easily set up by positioning buttons like " agree " or " cancel " in appropriate colors or other options for interaction . <p> 's E-Signing products have been integrated in many applications worldwide and use it successfully in their daily production . Some examples are electronic receipts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in research and development or to secure a postal voting process . <p> Promising Feedback <p> Peter Reschke , Head of Sales : " The initial feedback we have received about the announcement of a color signature tablet leveraging Wacom is overwhelming . It seems as if this is exactly the type of high quality pen pad the market was waiting for . Of course , we had several customers in the past that were choosing Wacom 's larger interactive pen displays which also offer a color display in sizes from 12 to 21.6 " . They display a document in full and allow to sign on the display , similar to working with a digitizer on a Tablet PC . However these devices with displays have their market in flagship stores of retailers and some financial institutions for example . The Color is likely to be the device which is almost everyone 's favorite as it is small enough to fit in a wide array of environment and allows mobile usage too .

 research into atomic detail of matter <p> The Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland is currently working on plans to develop an x-ray light source which will afford an previously uncharted insight into the status of matter . The large-scale research facility operates at wavelengths of just a fraction of a nanometer so tiny that it is able to detect even atomic detail . The nerve centre of the facility is the injector , which will be resting on a vibration-resistant mineral casting frame from . The first prototypes are already in operation . Construction of the injector is also being treated as the first test phase for the . <p> Scientists from the realms of physics , biology and medicine are waiting with bated breath for the day when the Swiss Free Electron Laser ( ) is up and running . Until that day arrives , the research technicians and engineers at the Paul Scherrer Institute ( PSI ) from Villigen in Switzerland are on track to realize the dream , with a facility that is set to cost an estimated 280 million Swiss Francs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to render particularly dynamic processes in molecules or solid bodies transparent on the smallest of time scales . " The relevant processes often take place at ultra-high speeds . Many chemical reactions happen within just a few femtoseconds , or billionths of a second . Our facility will allow these processes to be followed as if on film , or to depict molecules which were too small or impossible to fix using known imaging techniques " , explains Johan ? m from PSI . He is responsible for development and production of the girder for the facility . The lower the energy , the more precise the x-ray laser needs to be . According to ? m , this can only be guaranteed by providing the right foundation . Which is precisely what is going to happen . The base frame of the injector , known as the girder , is made of mineral casting from and is already proving a resounding success . The first prototypes have already completed the testing and analysis phase , and a small series of the tested bases is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in length and weigh in at 4,400 kilograms . Absolute stability for matter " The challenges posed by this project are threefold : extreme functionality , precision for the mounted components and absolute stability " , explains Dr. Jackisch , Managing Director of . The girder has to be vibration damping , provide a resonant frequency of 40 Hz and good rigidity , as well as absolute surface precision . The spec also includes non-magnetic properties and high thermal stability , and keeping costs to within reasonable limits is another requirement . The girder is also required to permit easy transportation with components already mounted . It was primarily the vibration damping , rigidity and facility for accuracy to within ten microns over a length of five meters made possible by precision grinding technology that impressed PSI . Another bonus was the scope for integration offered by mineral casting , allowing for instance profile rails to be used for variable component mounting . " Because the elimination of disturbing influences from the frame is vital for this project , mineral casting is ideally suited due to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mineral casting excels in highly dynamic applications " First and foremost , we had to consider how to reconcile the static , dynamic and thermal behavior of the injector . We had the fundamental advantage that mineral casting excels in highly dynamic applications " , recalls Marc Dizdarevic , Head of Technical Sales at with responsibility for the project . Mineral casting dampens vibrations and reduces noise emissions . " Mineral casting offers up to ten times better material damping than grey cast iron or welded machine bed materials " , according to Dizdarevic . Structure-borne noise analyses also testify to an over 20 per cent reduction in the sound pressure level . But it is also the high specific heat capacity and low thermal conduction of just 2,9 W/mK which make mineral casting the material of choice for the experts in Switzerland . Both these properties result in an inert response to short-term temperature fluctuations in the material . In addition , heating or cooling elements can be integrated in the mineral casting frame . " The specified properties of mineral casting such as vibration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confirmed by PSI on the basis of calculations and practical measurements " , says ? m . <p> Injector construction due for completion by the end of 2010 In the past year alone , processed 12,000 tons of mineral casting in the mechanical and appliance engineering sector , making it the market leader . The decision to opt for this as the material of choice for the large-scale research facility testifies once again to the merits of mineral casting over steel and grey cast iron . For Dr. Jackisch , clear confirmation : " Our cooperation with the Paul Scherrer Institute is a class A reference which is bound to recommend us for other research projects . The flexibility of mineral casting leaves no room for doubt " , enthuses . " has provided an all-round meticulously conceived answer to our demanding product brief and taken the project a decisive step forward . The sheer professionalism and efficiency which has marked our cooperation with has been another key aspect . We are confident that on this basis we will be able to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reports ? m . In developing this facility , his institute is under considerable competitive pressure . Development is currently in progress in a number of countries on x-ray light sources designed to deliver ultra-short laser pulses . The best known examples : the Linac Coherent Light Source ( LCLS ) in California and the European x-ray laser XFEL , due to be commissioned in 2014 in Hamburg . " Against this competitive background we need innovative concepts , and using mineral casting provides us with a vital trump card " , confirms ? m . <p> GmbH &amp; Co .

 used for spacing . The first layer of Bamtec reinforcement carpets is rolled out over this . <p> Anderson Construction , a reinforced concrete frame specialist , has overcome severe winter weather to complete the structural frames on a new urban regeneration project on schedule . In a development for Bellway at Tower Hamlets , they used the Bamtec system for the concrete floor slab reinforcement from Hy-Ten to sustain the programme momentum and complete the framework on-time . <p> Space One in Christian Street is a multi level development mixing affordable housing and high specification apartments , duplexes and penthouses . concrete piles and ground beams were required because of ground conditions to support the reinforced concrete frame structure . Each floor plate was approximately 1000 square metres . <p> The precise manual placement of reinforcement bars according to the structural engineer 's plan is required in conventional floor construction . This process is labour intensive , slow and especially susceptible to delays due to bad weather . Bamtec reinforcement overcomes many of these difficulties by the use of off-site manufactured carpets of reinforcement . <p> Adrian Gibbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September through to February we had some foul weather on this job with many wet and windy days . Using the Bamtec system we were able to make the most of the available fine weather windows to progress the reinforcement installation . Each concrete floor slab was finished in two weeks so the frame could be completed to schedule and without holding up the following trades . " <p> The Bamtec reinforcement carpet design was based on the specifications of structural engineers SDP in St Albans . Hy-Ten has the largest range of re-bar sizes available in the UK , allowing greater precision when specifying reinforcement . The original specifications were reinterpreted by Hy-Ten 's design team , taking into account their wider range of reinforcement bar sizes . <p> 's manufacturing process takes design information directly from the CAD system so that reinforcement bars of the correct length and diameter are spot welded onto steel tapes by automated machines in precise sequence . The carpet of reinforcement is taped and tagged with colour coding to indicate its position within the floor for the correct installation .

A second layer of reinforcement at 90 degrees to this is then rolled out to complete the lower layer . Prefabricated chairs are positioned over the base layer to create the required depth before the final layers of reinforcement are installed . Other reinforcement detailing such as the manual placement of supplementary bars in areas of greater stress and the installation of sheer bars is then completed before concrete pouring . <p> " Richard Webster , a director at Hy-Ten explained , " We can address several issues that are crucial for the construction industry such as overcoming skilled labour shortages and project delivery in a more timely way . Given how weather , unexpected site conditions and a host of other problems can set back construction projects , having a system to speed frame construction provides contractors with a vital opportunity to recover time and pull programmes back on schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for flat concrete slabs developed in Germany .

 , recently completed by Dr. Ignazio Maria Viola at the Yacht Research Unit of the University of Auckland , New Zealand , has demonstrated that the resistance of America 's Cup Yachts can be predicted with a high level of accuracy using CD-adapco 's engineering simulation tool STAR-CCM+ . <p> Dr. Viola used two candidate monohull designs from the 32nd America 's Cup to compare numerical simulation results from STAR-CCM+ with experimental results from a . At the time of the numerical analysis , the experimental data measured sinkage , trim and resistance was only available for one of the hulls . The simulations of the hulls , including keel , bulb and rudder and involving about 2 million control volumes , were performed on a simple multi-core workstation and delivered , in addition to trim , sinkage and resistance , detailed information about local variation of pressure and velocity in the flow . The latter is vital for the optimization of performance , since integral data alone does not give any indication of why one design would be better than the other . <p> The STAR-CCM+ results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computed within an accuracy of 0.01 ? , translating into an accuracy in the resistance predictions of the order of for the hull with its appendages against for the bare hull ten years ago . This level of accuracy is especially meaningful when compared with the uncertainty of the towing tank tests , which is also of the order of , and makes STAR-CCM+ the tool of predilection for design and analysis in the marine industry : " STAR-CCM+ is the most advanced code for simulating hull performance and it represents the state-of-the-art for the America 's Cup community " says Dr. Viola . <p> The next America 's Cup will probably be sailed in much rougher conditions than recent editions and seakeeping will be fundamental for a successful design . This raises a new question : how will we measure in the towing tank differences in the hydrodynamic drag smaller than when we have to model of boat speed in waves caused by a 30-knot wind ?

 fragrance , enhanced with gold leaf and its packaging concept are aimed at the <p> Metzingen , Germany . Two fragrance products by the name of " Zentropy " and " Goldskin " are the latest candidates to have been given a packaging makeover by Storopack . The special feature of the packaging concept used is the material : The fragrances are packaged in expanded polypropylene ( EPP ) . The result : a sales presentation with a look and feel which is quite out of the ordinary for the cosmetics sector . The contrast between the beauty products and the technical material of the outer casing effectively underpins the statement made by each of the fragrances . " Zentropy " offers up a hint of oriental splendour , while the appeal of " Goldskin " is all about glamour and luxury . <p> The use of EPP for retail packaging is the special province of the team from the Storopack Molding Division in Mollet , Spain , where these two latest projects were managed . The experts in Mollet are keen to point out the benefits of using EPP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its capacity for implementing the most unusual shape ideas , and its low volumetric weight which is a bonus along the whole supply chain . The material is also insensitive to damage , and will remain unscathed even after being picked off the sales shelf several times . <p> " Goldskin " and its variations , " Smart Goldskin " and " White Goldskin " are part of the " Ram ? n Molv ? zar " brand by B ? jar Signature ( Sant Cugat , Spain ) . This company specialises in perfume products for the international luxury goods market . The fragrance , enhanced with gold leaf , its glass flask , shaped like a rough diamond and its packaging concept are aimed at the top market segment . Previously , the perfume was retailed in a collapsible box , whose special " home impact " effect was achieved using a wooden platform for the flask . <p> For the relaunch , the molding experts at suggested the use of expanded polystyrene with an elegantly laminated surface achieved by texturing . The base element doubles up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the packaging . The two parts are joined together by a printed card sleeve . As the producer had hoped , the new presentation creates a highly distinctive appeal at the point-of-sale . In the previous version , the flask sometimes damaged the box from the inside a problem which has now been fully eliminated . The EPP provides great product protection even over long transportation distances . <p> The other fragrance " Zentropy " was required to launch for the pre-Christmas season 2010 . Two items required packaging , a perfume flask made of glass and a metal aerosol can containing a spray deodorant . The manufacturer , Nelia Internacional Cosm ? ticos , S.L. ( Roquetas de Mar , Spain ) opted to use a special variant of EPP in which the individual beads are cylindrical in shape with a continuous opening . The surface structure of the " porous EPP " ( ) and the elegant grey shade combine ideally with the purity of the minimalist cardboard sleeve graphic design to create a truly attention-grabbing effect . This concept turns what is actually a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Storopack team in Mollet had already been able to gather experience in retail packaging design in previous years . Projects completed in this field include two fragrance lines from fashion designers : For Roberto Verino and Carolina Herrera , whose perfume is produced by Antonio Puig . Also highly effective in terms of its shape , workmanship and functionality is the presentation box for Cava from Codorniu ( Esplugues de Llobregat , Spain ) : the insulating properties of EPP mean the attractive packaging also serves as a cooler . <p> is a leading manufacturer and service provider in the fields of protective and transport packaging as well as molded parts made of expanded foams . The sales of the worldwide operating group of companies with headquarters in Metzingen ( Germany ) are generated by the three divisions Molding , Packaging and Logistics .

In case of failures the steering control system switches automatically to a redundant CAN- bus , providing most secure data communication and built-in reliability of the whole system . <p> Since the ship 's steering control is one of the most critical systems on board , the new AS was carefully developed with regard to fail-to-safe principles .

In addition , an integrated data integrity monitoring ensures that inconsistencies within the steering system do not necessarily degrade the performance of the system . <p> As another safety-relevant benefit a new and simplified steering mode selector switch separates an independent " Main " non-follow-up steering position from a " Secondary " steering position with CAN-bus based autopilot or follow-up and non-follow-up controls . Olav Denker , Product Manager at Raytheon ? tz , states : " Compared to other steering control systems the new AS prevents from switching from a defective steering control to another defective steering control position . In case of an emergency , when time is crucial , this architecture supports the crew in their fast and safe decision making . AS will significantly contribute to safe and comfortable steering .

The system also allows to define up to four different dimming groups in accordance with different conditions of lightning on the bridge , for example on the main bridge , port and starboard wings or aft bridge . A comfortable take-over of steering control is possible from any steering position whereas a graphical operator unit also allows the the control of steering positions . Of course , the recently launched new 5000 series is seamlessly integrated into AS . <p> At shipyards the new AS steering control eases installation with easier wiring of standard power and bus connections , less cabling as well as quicker PC-based commissioning and system set-up . Ease of installation also improves installation quality and reduces failures during setting in operation or maintenance . <p> With an average number of 400 installations per year Raytheon ? tz is a leading provider of steering control systems . With the new steering control generation Raytheon ? tz continues the successful series of , which has proven itself to be a flexible , reliable and precise steering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single and double rudder , follow-up and non-follow-up controls .

It also occurs across all age groups , but is more commonly seen in people over the age of 40 . <p> Anatomy and Physiology When you swallow food , it first goes through a hollow muscular tube , called the esophagus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by repetitive wavelike contractions of the esophagus , referred to as peristalsis . Before food reaches the stomach , it passes a muscular sphincter that guards the stomach 's entrance and keeps stomach contents from rising back up . This is called the lower esophageal sphincter ( LES ) or cardiac sphincter , because of its proximity to the heart . <p> Causes of heartburns The most common cause of GERD ( gastro-esophageal reflux disease ) is a weak or incompetent LES , which allows stomach contents to reflux back up into the esophagus . Other causes of heartburn are abnormalities of the diaphragm . The diaphragm assists the LES in keeping stomach contents from flowing back into the esophagus , so diseased conditions of the diaphragm , such as hiatal hernia , may cause GERD ( gastro-esophageal reflux disease ) as well . Other factors which can contribute to GERD ( gastro-esophageal reflux disease ) include pregnancy and obesity . Both conditions increase the pressure in the abdomen , possibly helping stomach contents to be pushed back up . Several medications may also bring about or worsen GERD ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pressure or asthma . Investigation of the causes can provide you with some tips for getting rid of heartburn . <p> Diagnosis Usually , GERD ( gastro-esophageal reflux disease ) can be alleviated by medications ( like Proton Pump Inhibitors ( PPIs ) ) and lifestyle modifications . But if your condition is severe , your doctor may order certain laboratory tests to be performed . These are done to either rule out or confirm other conditions that might have caused your GERD ( gastro-esophageal reflux disease ) , or identify if complications have arisen . Some of these tests include : <p> 1 . **26;170;TOOLONG , or EGD , which uses a thin tube that is inserted into your esophagus , then into your stomach , up to the initial section of your small intestine . This tube has a fiber-optic camera at its tip , so the doctor can visualize the internal structure of your organs , and can detect if there is irritation or damage to its lining . <p> 2 . A barium swallow , you to swallow a chalky-white solution containing barium . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to detect the barium . This is performed to detect structural abnormalities in your esophagus , stomach and small intestine . <p> 3 . Esophageal pH monitoring , which employs the use of a small tube inserted into your esophagus through the nose or mouth . This tube stays in for 24 hours , while you go about and record your daily activities . This can not detect if there are structural abnormalities , but is helpful in determining if your GERD ( gastro-esophageal reflux disease ) is associated with other symptoms , such as coughing . <p> 4 . Esophageal manometry , which utilizes a thin tube that can detect how much pressure is exerted onto it . This tube is inserted into your stomach through either your mouth or nose , and is then pulled back gradually until it sits in your esophagus . The doctor will ask you to swallow , so he can take pressure readings at different levels of your esophagus . <p> Signs and Symptoms The most common symptom of GERD ( gastro-esophageal reflux disease ) is heartburn . Because stomach fluid is acidic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abdomen or chest , or under the breastbone . This can get especially severe if you lie down after a meal . Many patients also feel nauseous after eating . <p> Less common reflux symptoms include coughing , hiccupping , and difficulty in swallowing . You may also experience hoarseness or recurrent sore throats due to the irritant effect of the acid reflux . <p> Complications Repeated exposure to gastro acid reflux can cause inflammation in your esophagus . This is medically known as esophagitis . Chronic esophagitis can cause scarring and fibrosis in the esophageal mucosa . This can cause the esophageal opening to narrow down , making it difficult to swallow food . Some patients may develop Barrett 's esophagus , where there is a change in the cells of the esophageal lining . This is a pre-cancerous condition that , if left untreated , may eventually lead to esophageal cancer . <p> 1 . Quit smoking , if you 're a smoker . Smoking is known to slow down esophageal peristalsis . Moreover , it is a risk factor for esophageal cancer , and other cancers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the day , instead of just 3 large ones . 3 . Do n't lie down immediately after eating . Wait up to 2-3 hours after your last meal before going to bed . 4 . Elevate the head of your bed , so you can take advantage of gravity to help keep the food down . 5 . Do n't wear constrictive clothing . 6 . Try to lose weight , if you 're overweight or obese . 7 . Avoid irritant foods . These include , but are not limited to : <p> If you want more information regarding medication follow our blog , because we will review the pros &amp; cons of the most common drugs used for the treatment of GERD ( gastro-esophageal reflux disease ) . You may also elect to undergo surgery if your reflux symptoms do n't improve , even with intensive medication therapy . The mainstay surgical operation for GERD ( gastro-esophageal reflux disease ) is called Nissen fundoplication . During this surgery , a portion of the upper stomach is taken and wrapped around the LES , such that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done laparoscopically .

A study published by the German Ministry for Family , Seniors , Women and Youths last year , showed that violence against women is not a problem of social focus , but is widely spread across all social classes . The frightening finding was that every one in four women has been abused by their partner . <p> With training- and educational campaigns the German committee for UNIFEM tried to give the women knowledge , power and self-confidence to speak up for their own rights . The aim of the committee for UNIFEM is to work on ways of breaking through the structural violence and the discrimination of women , which is actually connected to this . " This is an investment that is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , stressed Karin Nordmeyer . Domestic violence - very much still a current topic that is often ignored in society with looking the other way or " not wanting to get involved " when it happens .

 created a bridge between competition venues in Garmisch-Partenkirchen <p> With the World Skiing Championships , which run from the 7th to the 20th February 2011 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen , A&amp;O Technology is adding another magnificent project to its portfolio . Together with Osram , the company adorned the night sky above the world famous ski resort with a bridge of light linking the main competition venues an unusual and spectacular construct as well as contributed through the use of state-of-the-art lighting technology a unique ambiance to both the official opening and daily medal presentation ceremonies <p> A breathtaking spectacle awaited the athletes and hundred thousand plus visitors expected in Garmisch-Partenkirchen for the World Skiing Championships in February : during the opening ceremony in the Olympic Stadium and each evening 's medal presentation ceremonies , in the course of a lavish lightshow visible way beyond the limits of the Garmisch-Partenkirchen district , a bridge was fashioned in the night sky linking the three main competition venues : the Olympic Stadium , Kandahar and Medal Plaza . The effect was achieved through the deployment at each of the three venues of high-powered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the night sky equidistant from all three . With blue beams emanating from the Olympic Stadium , red from the Kandahar downhill run and burnished gold from Medal Plaza , the bridge was resplendent in the colours of the FIS ( F ? d ? ration Internationale de Ski ) , which had organized the event . <p> " With the world championships this year being held in our own country , we feel it is incumbent upon us as a company with a rich tradition to ensure through the use of state-of-the-art lighting technology that the event will be an unforgettable experience , " explained Wolfgang Gregor , Osram 's Director of Customer Relationship Management . " Furthermore , through a project in the Galapagos Islands , we are rendering the overall production carbon neutral . " <p> For the light show on opening night , a total of thirty-eight FALCON high-powered xenon searchlights of the kind often seen at major concerts and outdoor events were deployed . They were equipped with OSRAM XBO 7 KW lamps . Thanks to the extremely high luminance and excellent colour reproduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night sky over Garmisch-Partenkirchen should be nothing if not impressive . A further 4,500 coloured OSRAM high-powered LEDs in the Olympic Stadium and Medal Plaza contributed additional colour and dazzling effects to the opening ceremony and medal presentations . <p> As was the case with the illumination recently of the 60-foot-high bronze statue of the Goddess of Bavaria during the 200th Oktoberfest in Munich , the technical realization of the light show was the responsibility of A&amp;O Technology . To create the bridge of light , which was visible nightly from 5pm to 10pm in the sky over Garmisch-Partenkirchen , over sixty FALCON xenon searchlights were used . Eighteen FALCON 6000 CMY units were positioned in the upper tier of the Olympic Stadium , whilst three FALCON BEAM and eight FALCON FLOWER units were placed on the ski jump , the landing area of which was converted through the use of video projectors into a giant canvas . At the take-off point , the beams of ten FALCON BEAM units composed the pier of the Olympic Stadium span of the bridge at . At Medal Plaza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve FALCON BEAM units formed a second pier . The third pier was sculpted by nine FALCON BEAM searchlights in the Kandahar Arena . The opening show paid tribute to the contributions to world culture of local figures such as composer Richard Strauss and children 's author Michael Ende , by drawing upon themes from works such as the " Rosenkavalier " and " Momo " . <p> The construction each evening of the bridge of light began with the creation of a 4-minute frozen image : a white pyramid of light . Only then the orientation of the beams slowly changed to compose a bridge in the sky in the colours of the FIS , with the colour blue assigned to the Olympic Stadium , red to the Kandahar Arena and burnished gold to Medal Plaza . This constellation , too , however , proved transitory as the beams reverted to their original configuration and the pyramid of white light reappeared .

 Loss Revision featuring Eric Petitti <p> In Loss Revision , Eric Petitti presents a series of works excerpted from his project " The Dreadnaught Saga " . The project is designed to emphasize the ways in which depictions of history can distort the past in order to influence the present . On close inspection , the details within the work offer different perspectives either embracing the larger story or contradicting the truth that they claim to espouse . This exhibit presents the competing theories put forth to explain the disappearance of the legendary defense ship the Golden Pear in 2535 CE , whose loss led to the First Polar War between the Antarctic Collective and the Union . <p> Eric Petitti was born and raised in the Boston area . He received his B.F.A . at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago .

 presenting the young Berlin artist Emeli Theander ( *1984 G ? teborg , Sweden ) in her first gallery exhibition ! <p> The painter and street artist Emeli Theander continues to follow traces of outsiders and freaks , diving into worlds inhabited by ghosts . What connects these figures is their existence at the margins of modern imagination <p> For this first solo show Emeli is dealing with the belief in the . This old Nordic folk-belief describes a special behaviour of ghosts which perhaps could have serious consequences also for the living . According to this folk-belief ghosts are allowed to leave their graves between midnight and sunrise . However , when surprised by morning dawn , they could not move any more , but they still were remaining invisible for humans . In case a human being happened to touch one of the ghosts in this state , he was afflicted by more or less serious illness . Today the term still is being used to describe something which is weirdly thrilling . <p> Theander is engaged with the spirit worlds of different cultures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , stuck between this or another world , or whether they are mere products of our imagination , is not one 's work seeks to answer . Real or not , her interest lies in their poetic potential , as catalysts for imaginative scenarios . Thus in the actual process of painting , ghosts become metaphors , for mediators between the realm of the real and the imagined or even for the space ' in-between ' they inhabit . The continuity of referring to spheres at the margin of or between worlds shows a strong fascination for ephemeral states in which vagueness dominates over fixed meanings . <p> Surprisingly the paintings themselves are detailed , like careful visual reports of scenes actually observed . The tension of ambiguity the paintings radiate might derive from the interaction between different layers unfolded in each picture . Ghosts are depicted as subjects directed towards the viewer , in the background unidentifiable ghosts make their appearance even ghosts are haunted by ghosts . <p> Many of the figures in the paintings for this exhibition are inspired by Korean myths , ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned houses . The photographs are fragmentary lost memories without a concrete connection point for a random person . What remains is a vague feeling of past situations or the pace of change itself . In using them as a source of inspiration in her paintings , the artist weaves a net of meanings around these fragments and connects them to the notion of ghosts as existences in-between . Women and girls with long hair , Korean pre-modern costumes or the connection between birds and shamans are all worked into the fabric of Theander 's compositions . The attempt to decipher her paintings leaves a lot of open questions and maybe only one certainty that in creating layers of meaning and focusing on shifting processes between them , is mediating herself , between ghosts and humans , and between imaginative scenarios and her paintings . <p> Galerie Adler is focusing on new and fresh international talents with a unique handwriting going along with strong and challenging themes . The artists reflect the self-image , the desires and dreams of human beings in today 's society . They explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , faith and despair as well as angst , loneliness , violence and other kinds of human abysses . Their work can be described as morbid , provocative , bizarre but also as ironic , mystic and grotesque . They provide a link between drama and humour .

 Kicks-off its New Business Model <p> Bonn , 28 March 2011 . The 4C Executive Board announced today that the 4C Association will start the transition phase to enforce its new business model , which will be fully operational by the beginning of 2012 . The business model was first approved by the 4C Council during its last meeting in Arusha , Tanzania , on 15 February . This new focus will allow the 4C Association to adapt its modus operandi to better serve the needs of its members in the current coffee market context . " With its new business model , the 4C Association will focus on core activities to serve members ' interests and particularly encourage the demand of 4C Compliant Coffee in the market . The new model also reflects 4C <p> Members ' ambition to transform the Association into THE network of genuinely committed actors who work together to address the sustainability issues of the sector in a pre-competitive manner . I am looking forward to this new 4C Association which I believe will play a crucial role in shaping the future development of a sustainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 4C Association . The 4C Association received broad support from its members , many of whom committed to making an extra financial contribution totalling ? 440,000 to ensure a smooth transition into the new model . Shift to a demand driven approach : The shift to the new business model will not affect the mission or vision of the 4C Association . The 4C Association will continue working to achieve its goal of building a sustainable mainstream coffee community through sector compliance to at least baseline sustainability standards . However , to achieve this goal , the 4C Association will now shift from a supply driven to a demand driven approach . The former approach was key to the starting phase of the 4C Project a decade ago . It helped in building up a supply of 4C Compliant Coffee , training producers in the application of the 4C baseline sustainability standard and broadening the network of partners and members . By building on these initial successes , the new demand driven approach will also make the 4C system much more commercially viable . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will focus on a core set of services that are beneficial to all its members . Core services include , among others , setting and maintaining the 4C baseline standard , defining the rules of the verification system , providing producers with access to tools and information on sustainability practices , acting as a multi-stakeholder exchange platform and actively promoting all sustainability standards in the market . Core services are thought as those key activities that are beneficial to all members . In addition , members will be able to acquire tailor-made services on demand at an extra cost such as trainings , communication services or personalized guidance on verification requirements . In this way , 4C Members will be able to better define their needs and receive those additional services they deem necessary .

 heavy-duty shoring tower is currently being used as falsework for the building of a motorway bridge across the Rio Sordo an impressive 30 m high and with leg loads of up to 600 kN . Through the use of rentable system components taken from the VARIOKIT engineering construction kit , PERI was able to develop a cost-effective solution for the superstructure formwork and shoring . <p> The A4 motorway is situated in the north of Portugal and stretches eastwards from Porto on the Atlantic coast to Bragan ? a on the Spanish border . The route through the Mar ? o Mountains requires the building of a new motorway bridge for crossing the Sordo Valley near Vila Real . This is in the form of a 412 m long , five-section structure with two separate superstructures . The almost 20 m wide and 3.60 m high pre ? stressed concrete hollow box girders are being realised using two different construction methods : the three middle bridge spans with the balanced cantilever method and the respective edge spans formed on PERI shoring . <p> Comprehensive PERI formwork and scaffolding solution PERI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the construction of all structural components : VARIO elements and CB brackets formed the climbing formwork for the bridge piers ; for the pier tables , suspended SB brace frames served as load ? bearing scaffold whilst the VARIO girder wall formwork system was used for forming the starters for the balanced cantilever . The superstructure formwork and falsework for the four edge sections are based on the engineering construction kit . The fact that the superstructure width increases from 16 m to 19.40 m was taken into consideration during the planning phase . <p> 30 m high falsework As falsework , the contractor is using VARIOKIT VST heavy ? duty shoring towers 6 m to 30 m high - with load ? bearing capacities of up to 2,500 kN each . The VST towers are erected as four-legged individual structures which support the 72 m long superstructure formwork at defined load application points with axis spacings of between 10 m and 24 m . Transversely , the tower measures 2.00 m in each case , longitudinally between 2.00 m and 7.50 m depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjected to particularly high loads , additional legs with axis spacings of 37.5 cm provide an increase in the load ? bearing capacities . The partial adaptation to the loads which are to be carried considerably reduces material requirements along with minimizing the erection work needed for the falsework . <p> Modular system for maximum adaptability Due to the modular design of the VST heavy ? duty shoring towers , it is possible to adapt the load ? carrying system to suit all construction site requirements . This has meant that lateral truss girder spacings and the distances of the supports in a longitudinal direction can be variably defined and has led to an optimization of the static system overall . In addition , all individual legs can be adapted to suit the different ground contact areas as well as the geometry of the superstructure formwork . Furthermore , adaptations due to the bridge piers has therefore been possible with system components . <p> friendly assembly Assembly of the falsework was carried out using variable frame arrangements with heights ranging from 1.25 m to 10.25 m . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further extended on the ground to form tower segments . A crane was used for erection of the towers and height extensions . Safe PERI UP working platforms are used to ensure accurate positioning along with fixing in place with bolts and pins . Together with the heavy-duty shoring towers , these are continuously added to as required . <p> PERI heavy-duty shoring tower The new VST heavy-duty shoring tower from PERI ( VST = Shoring Tower ) serves as load-bearing scaffold in large bridge construction and civil engineering projects . The modular system can be assembled extremely flexibly for heights up to 40 m as frame arrangements , towers or shoring tower frames . As part of the VARIOKIT engineering construction kit , PERI also uses multi-purpose system components which are completely rentable for heavy-duty shoring towers . Bolts and pins as standardised connecting elements facilitate simple and fast assembly . Special parts and time-consuming welded structures carried out on site are no longer necessary . <p> PERI was founded in 1969 and is today the leading provider of formwork and scaffolding systems . Along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company has 48 international subsidiaries and 100 stock yards around the world .

 sculptor William Wauer was the first in Europe to create the pure cubist sculpture . " ( Rudolf Bl ? , 1921 ) <p> The sculptural work of Berlin artist William Wauer lies at the heart of the exhibition . Beginning in 1916 , he entered the scene at Herwarth Walden 's legendary avant-garde gallery " Der Sturm " on Potsdamer Stra ? e as a sculptor and painter , following a successful career as a theater and film director , among other endeavors . <p> His sculptures are characterized by an abstraction , leading to a whole new form of expression , particularly in the field of portrait sculpture . His most famous work , the " ? ste " monumental bust of Herwarth Walden , has become the epitome of formal radicalism of German Modernism . In 1937 Wauer 's works were denounced as " entartet " degenerate . In addition to the portraits , he created a number of large figures that are traversed by spatial lines of movement in the sense of " rhythmically restrained dynamics " ( Wauer ) , retaining their formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during and after World War II , Berlin was an international hub of modernity , manifesting itself in various and overlapping trends and styles . The exhibition " William Wauer and Berlin Cubism " explores the hitherto neglected influences of Cubism on sculpture during the late Imperial era and the Weimar Republic . " Berlin Cubism " as a deliberately dramatic term aims to detect and visualize trends that , in Germany , were almost completely hidden or commandeered by " Expressionism " before . <p> French Cubism provided sculpture 's main impetus for a geometricized reduction of bodies to the basic forms of cube , cylinder , cone and pyramid . But this is only one aspect . A new understanding of space in view of a fully three-dimensional development and penetration of surfaces , masses and space was equally crucial for this transfer of Cubist methods from painting to sculpture . The " Cubist " , as it was described earlier in the German art discourse in connection with archaic and extra-European sculpture , was a vital formal point of reference for avant-garde sculpture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rudolf Bl ? even granted William Wauer a leading role in the formulation of Cubist sculpture in his 1921 book " Der Geist des und die K ? " The Spirit of Cubism and the Arts . This may not be historically correct , but such an assessment does document a contemporary view that can be applied to other artists of the time . In particular , this applies to the works of Berlin-born Rudolf Belling and the Ukrainian sculptor Alexander Archipenko in Paris , who was one of the first artists to take up the formal innovations of Cubism and was shown by Herwarth Walden several times at " Sturm " after 1913 . From 1921 to 1923 , he lived in Berlin before emigrating to the USA . Edwin Scharff also gathered his most important artistic influences in Paris and transformed from a Cubist painting to a Cubist sculptor afterwards , before coming to Berlin in 1923 . Cubist influences can also be made out in the works of Oswald Herzog , Johannes Itten , Otto Freundlich , Herbert Garbe , Katharina Heise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marg Moll , Emy Roeder , Richard Scheibe , Kurt Schwitters , Hans Uhlmann , , as well as in the sculptural approaches of architects Walter Gropius , Max Taut and Vasily Luckhardt . <p> Many avant-garde sculptures from that period did not survive the iconoclasm by the Nazis and WWII destruction and are only preserved in photographs . So in addition to sculptures and architectural designs , various illustrations will aid the visitor 's introduction to " Berlin Cubism " . <p> With generous support from the Ernst von Siemens Art Foundation and in cooperation with the Edwin Scharff Museum Neu-Ulm ( duration of the second exhibition station : 3 September , 2011 15 January , 2012 ) <p> Georg-Kolbe-Museum is located in the former of the sculptor Georg Kolbe ( 1877-1947 ) in Berlin-Westend close to the Olympic Stadium .

 , chief editor of daily was conferred Dr Alexander Daniel memorial award by Ecocert India for the year 2011 on 5th April at Aurangabad , Maharashtra for his exemplary work in the field of promotion of organic farming in the suicide prone region of Maharashtra . Aurangabad , When everyone in India was busy celebrating ICC cricket world cup victory and shedding tears of happiness for their 11 heroes , a small ceremony was organised in the busy city of Aurangabad on 5th April to felicitate an unsung hero Mr Prakash for his decade long notable work in the field of organic farming and organic food promotion . He was conferred Ecocert India sponsored prestigious Dr Alexander Daniel memorial award . The small but pleasant program witnessed the presence of Ecocert India 's staff , organic entrepreneurs and farmers associated with Ecocert India 's mission to create a country of healthy and toxin free lands and lifestyles . <p> " It 's been two years we have started this award and we are honoured to present this award to Mr Prakash for his selfless service towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Managing Director of Ecocert India at this occasion . Ms Kavita Mukhi , the lady now popularly known for her farmers ' market initiative in Mumbai and the recipient of last year 's award presented the award to Mr Prakash . Ms Mukhi in her speech admired the work of Mr and emphasized the need to get rid of the hyped refined products viz. refined sugar , refined oil and refined salt the ' evil trinity ' as well as genetically modified food . She emphasized the importance of local fresh organic food and India 's traditional wisdom of healthcare and agriculture . Mr Prakash , chief editor and managing director of a popular Marathi language daily newspaper ' ' , was instrumental for past 10 years for the promotion of organic farming in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra . A social activist by nature , Mr has worked tirelessly for past 10 years to sympathize the dreaded small and marginal farmers of Vidarbha , helped them to get out of the vicious circle of chemical and high input agriculture and embrace the low/no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their small piece of holdings . He specially started a weekly newspaper ' ' to promote the philosophy of low budget organic farming , which soon rose to fame . At the same time he sensitized the consumers to fear the food from chemical agriculture , and detox their bodies by consuming only organic food . He used the platform of his non political newspaper effectively to promote organic agriculture and its benefits . " I was perturbed by the increasing suicide rate of farmers in Vidarbha in the year 2001 and forced to study each and every case of suicide . The outcome of the in depth study unmasked the real culprit . It was none other than the so called modern agriculture , " said , Mr Prakash while sharing his views on this occasion . " The farming of older days was much in harmony with the nature . The mixed cropping pattern , holistic and local cow dependent agriculture was self sustaining and meeting the basic needs of the farmers . The introduction and propaganda of high input agriculture detached the farmers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the production of poisoned produce from dead soils . All their traditional wisdom became useless in no time with the advent of modern agriculture . Result was manifested by the increasing debts , decreasing productivity of farms and increasing rate of farmers ending their lives in depression , " said Mr . " Promotion of organic farming seemed to be the only solution and that is what i have been doing for past 10 years through my newspaper , my speeches and my own organic farming demonstration plot . I am grateful to Ecocert India for having appreciated my work and this gives me the much needed encouragement and motivation to work more for the sustainable development of farmers in my region , " expressed Mr " Late Dr Alexander Daniel worked whole his life for the upliftment of small and marginal farmers of the country and adoption of organic agriculture was that sound tool he believed will help those millions of disadvantaged farmers in the country to realise this dream . The award being given in his name aims at creating the fraternity of warriors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is conventional to disseminate the message of sustainability , strengthening of local economies , safe consumption and sovereignty " , said Dr Amol Nirban , Business Development Officer of Ecocert India and member of selection committee . <p> Ecocert is committed to establish trust and faith between clients and consumers of organic products . ensures that operators follow ecologically sound production and processing methods in accordance with the set standards .

 three rarely played cello concertos of the 20 century <p> Cello Concertos of the 20th century These three cello concertos reflect the different destinies of three Jewish composers . Born in Brno , Erich Wolfgang Korngold achieved great success in Vienna , moved to Los Angeles in 1934 and had to remain in the U.S. when the Nazis invaded Austria in 1938 . Geneva-born composer Ernest Bloch worked for several years in the U.S. starting in 1916 , and in 1938 he made the State of Oregon his new home . Originally from Hamburg , Berthold Goldschmidt worked as composer and as conductor in Berlin : in 1935 he was obliged to pack his few meagre belongings in order to emigrate to London . Each of these concertos clearly reflects the upheavals of the fractured 20th century . What they all have in common is the use of the modern , ' emancipated ' cello 's full range of instrumental possibilities , requiring the radically enlarged range of playing techniques introduced by Julius Klengel and David Popper ( truly ' revolutionary ' virtuosos of their time ) . <p> Julian Steckel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gustav Rivinius , Boris Pergamenschikow and Antje Weithaas , has had an early career already , before he won after various other competitions the ARD competition in Munich in September 2010 .

 MW Biogas Plant in Hungary <p> Additionally , an external 650 cubic metres gas storage tank will be installed on site <p> In April , WELTEC BIOPOWER started building a biogas plant in Szeged , Southern Hungary . The client and operator is Z ? ? s Energia , a subsidiary of the Hungarian power supplier D ? M ? SZ . The 1 MW plant , which comprises two CHPs with an output of 600 kW/h each , will generate power and heat from pig manure and maize silage starting from end of 2011 on . The substrate will be supplied by farmers in the vicinity of the site . In turn , the farmers will use the digestate left over from the biogas production process as fertiliser for their fields . The generated heat will be used to heat office buildings . <p> The WELTEC biogas plant comprises two 3,000 cubic metres fermenters with double-membrane roofs . Thus , the fermenters have a gas buffer capacity of 1,016 cubic metres each . Additionally , an external 650 cubic metres gas storage tank will be installed on site ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electricity prices , which are twice as high at daytime , in the best way possible . Thus , the biogas will be collected in the fermenter storage tank and in the external gas storage tank at night , and the two CHP modules will run under full load at daytime . One of the reasons why Z ? ? s Energia awarded the contract to WELTEC and the Hungarian sales partner was that WELTEC systems not only provide a high power and heat yield , but also guarantee low internal energy consumption . <p> Being determined to push ahead power generation on the basis of renewable energies , Hungary promotes the establishment of biogas plants by means of one-time financial subsidies and other means . According to the German-Hungarian Chamber of Industry and Commerce , the subsidies are expected to play a key role in increasing the share of renewable energies in the energy consumption to 13 percent by 2020 . At present , there are 12 biogas plants throughout the country . Another 40 are in the planning stage or already under construction . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total of about 32 MW , which would represent a 5 percent share of biogas in the energy generation from renewable energies . <p> Most of the projects will be launched in connection with subsidised investments in animal husbandry . Previously , the long amortisation periods proved to be an obstacle to investments . For this reason , the feed-in tariffs and other factors are being examined . While biogas and natural gas are presently subject to equal tariffs , biogas is to be given preference in the grid in the future . Hungary already has an efficient natural gas grid and is thus well prepared for the global trend to use natural gas and biogas for generating electricity . <p> German-based WELTEC celebrates ist 10th anniversary and is one of the pioneers of the constructors biogas plants . Based on the modern approach of experienced engineers , the company from Vechta ( Lower Saxony ) with its expertise of a staff of close to 80 , offers complete biogas plants from one source and has developed to a leading constructor of biogas plants in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to deliver individual and flexible solutions from compact plants to large computer-controlled plants in the megawatt range , waste recycling plants , and biogas parks with gas processing technology . The plants have a modular structure . WELTEC BIOPOWER uses only proven system components and develops most of the technologies along the entire value chain internally : fermenter technology , mixing technology , control technology , hygienisation systems , and digestate processing solutions originate from the company . As the hydrogen sulphide and ammonia compounds contained in biogas corrode unprotected parts , WELTEC builds the fermenters from stainless steel . This ensures a long useful life of the plant . The manufacturing depth also guarantees a consistently high standard regardless of the location and ensures an export rate that is far above the industry average . In 2010 , the plants of WELTEC received the ? DLG " certification from the German Agri- cultural Association ( DLG ) in recognition of their excellent biogas yield . <h> to raise

Caucasus Online is implementing the Motorola-based middleware from the Czech company a.s . <p> The other reason for selecting the H264 encoder was the compact size and fanless form-factor . Another important point was the fact that the H264 encoder supports many different encoding inputs , as there are still some small TV stations that operate only with CVBS and SDI can not be used . As the H264 encoder supports all these inputs by default , there was no need for converters or different encoder models . The complete installation could be handled with a single product model .

 a high degree of reinforcement and weight as well as large heights these are the challenges facing the construction team for the realisation of a new power station in the Schwarze Pumpe Industrial Park in Spremberg ( Germany ) . For this , PERI planned and supplied a comprehensive formwork and scaffolding solution . The combined use of climbing formwork , access technology , reinforcement scaffolding and shoring through to heavy duty shoring towers has been perfectly matched to suit jobsite requirements . <p> The Glass Leipzig GmbH construction team have to deal with a tight schedule with just 18 months available to complete the skeleton work for the over 50 m high power station complex with fuel and slag bunkers , boiler house and flue gas purification unit as well as a tipping hall . Start of operations is planned for the beginning of 2013 with the facility having been designed to generate 110 megawatts of thermal power . The short construction time not only results in the need of large quantities of formwork and scaffolding materials but it also requires perfectly coordinated planning of the system equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoring towers temporarily support the cantilevered components . With an individual leg supporting height of 23.60 m , each legs of the falsework carries loads of 560 kN this means that a single tower supports more than 200 tonnes . Assembly of the heavy duty towers is carried out easily and safely horizontally on the ground using two 10 m sections which are supplemented with the corresponding base and head units . <p> The possibility of combining the units with the PERI UP Rosett Flex modular scaffold system allowed the formation of safe working platforms in the head area . These had already been fixed to the shoring when it was positioned horizontally on the ground and then erected together with the tower unit . Thus , no risky assembly operations were necessary at great heights . <p> Flexible and versatile scaffolding In addition , the PERI UP scaffolding system provides the basis for all access means as well as the shoring and reinforcement scaffold on the jobsite . The Glass site personnel mount the scaffold units and continually adapt these to match the construction progress . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximize material utilisation . Another advantage is the of larger scaffold units which clearly accelerates the moving process . <p> For fast and safe access to all working areas , large numbers of staircase towers have been installed . 75 cm wide , easy to handle stair elements are used in order to realise the up to 60 m high access points . The permissible load of the high strength aluminium flights of stairs is 2.0 kN/m ? . With lightweight but high load bearing system components of the flexible PERI UP Rosett Flex scaffold , the walkways and landing junctions are also realised . <p> Furthermore , PERI UP is being used by the Glass team as type tested shoring for supporting heights of up to 20 m . The metric grid dimensions ensure here a maximum degree of adaptation of the load-bearing system to the actual loads and , hence , the optimization of material requirements . In addition , PERI UP also serves as reinforcement scaffold . The units are up to 10 m high and can be transported as 60 m ? moveable units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time-consuming modification work . <p> Climbing on a large scale The CB 240 climbing scaffold system and VARIO GT 24 girder wall formwork form crane moveable climbing formwork units for constructing the massive walls of the building with concreting cycle heights of 4 m . The formwork concept that has been developed requires in particular adapting different climbing cycles to suit the complicated geometry : the walls have haunched corners and taper upwards from 1.40 m to 0.30 m . The PERI solution takes into consideration all climbing cycles whereby adjusting to a 10 cm wall thickness difference each time is required . <p> PERI was founded in 1969 and is today the leading provider of formwork and scaffolding systems .

Starting with whole teak wood houses , in Thai and European style , solid wood flooring , wall cladding , stairs and railings , skirting , roof panels , doors and windows to the European standards , and furniture in teakwood . <p> 's Planted Teak Wood . Teak wood . is well-known around the world due to its high quality texture and naturally beautiful colors and figures . <p> The texture of teak wood is quite fine , straight-grained , light in weight , and strong with little shrinkage and expansion . It is also not easily torn up or cracked . Such properties make it easy to saw , plane and carve teak wood . Besides that , teak wood texture is highly weatherproof and resistant to termite , insect or fungus attacks on account of the fact that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termites and fungi , as can evidently be seen from the condition of several hundred-year-old temples built from teak wood in the cities of the northern region of the Kingdom .

They are awarded the state concession to operate the Teak forestry industry of Uttaradit province since 1967 . They had envisioned the significance of Teak forestry , the maximization of Teakwood material usage , and creating maximum counts of job opportunities for the local people . Consequently , in 1979 they set out to establish the Tha Sao Sawmill Limited Partnership , at Tha Sao Subdistrict , and the Tha Sak Sawmill Co. , Ltd. at Tha Sak Subdistrict , province , to recover raw teakwood materials left over from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stocks . The underlying fact was that the major teakwood buyers would select only the required sizes and shapes and refused the unwanted stocks which are , in most cases , refused by all other buyers as well . Then in 1984 Khun Khun Sunan went overseas to observe and study the forest cultivation for economic purposes to bring back the know-how and apply them to their Teak Cultivation Project in light of the gradual depletion of natural forests justifying the replenishing cultivations for use as economic forests in the future . And they chose to cultivate teak forests , for teak wood is very well known all over the world . Its hues , and texture grains are simply aesthetic , with other excellent properties such as low expansion and contraction coefficients , low deformation values , sun and water resistance , termite repellant quality and most important of all the lands of Uttaradit Province are suitable for teak cultivations . And as an evidence , there stands a large teak tree which is the largest in the world , the age of the tree reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction of the province . So they started and continued their teak forest cultivations and the number of the teak trees kept multiplying . In the year 2003 they started their first series of comb cutting the teak stocks from their cultivated forests as a measure of freeing up the dense spots to promote better growth , and brought the comb cut stocks into use by introducing the appropriate and necessary technology into the production processes to obtain the highest quality products , best suitable for functional uses , with the best fair-pricing scheme , under the brand name of TS teak . They also planned new annual extensions of teak forest cultivations with systematic and organized approach to bring about the highest efficiency thereof of the whole process , bringing in various technologies to support the plantations to achieve highest level of efficiency . Because after having reclaimed the comb cut teak stocks and put them in to the revival manufacturing processes , the products from which are now gaining acceptances of general customers . And with the universal awareness of the " Global Warming " situation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood materials that have their origins from natural forests . We all must contribute to adding up oxygen supply to our planet earth . And by the awareness and the responsibility as a leader in forest cultivation , all comb cut wood stocks from the cultivation process are to be revived and put into use with minimal waste and maximum usefulness , reducing uses of other natural wood materials that require hundreds or thousands of years to produce , supporting the concept of Sufficiency Economy , creating job employments for local people , cutting their chances of having to leave their homes to seek employments , building stronger family bonds and lessening social problems . @ @ @ @ @ <p> Indian actress Freida 
 Mission taken up with Passion at Shekhawati Rajasthan Schools <p> HelpAge India SAVE Mission taken up with Passion at Shekhawati Rajasthan Schools <p> We all are affected by what we learn at a young age . HelpAge 's SAVE - Student Action for Value Education programme 's main focus is to sensitize school children on ageing issues early in life , so they treat their elderly with love and care and understand their issues in depth . <p> HelpAge India voices the concerns of India 's elderly . Currently there are estimated to be 90 million elderly in the nation . It protects their rights , focusing on issues such as pensions , social inclusion , and health care , and enables them to live with self-fulfillment and dignity . Mathew Cherian , Chief Executive of Helpage India who had graduated from Birla Institute of Technology and Science BITS Pilani says " The elderly need food ; they need pensions ; they need healthcare and we are completely at a loss , and this problem is only going to grow .

Starting from the year 1991 , the United Nations ' - UN International Day of Older Persons is celebrated annually on October 1 to recognize the contributions of older persons and to examine issues that affect their lives . <p> The grandparents may have silvery hair but their hearts always have been golden . One can say that a little bit of parent , a little bit of teacher , a little bit of best friend all rolled into one is the grandparent . It is essential that this generation of children in India today realize that Grandparents are indeed our heritage as well as essential members of our families and communities . <p> Every child has fond memories forever of their grandparents holding on their tiny hands with affection and telling fairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Ramayana and Mahabharata . Most children in India today indeed proudly claim their knowledge of these epics from " kahani " sessions by grandparents . Dadi Maa ki has always been an integral component of Indian civilization . <p> Indian values have long been tied to a particularly high degree of respect for the elderly . A common tradition in India has been the young touching the feet of the elderly as a sign of love and respect . The changing value system in Indian society has pushed the elderly to old age homes or isolated them to care for themselves . <p> It is known that Information is just bits of data while Knowledge is putting them together and Wisdom is transcending them and it is indisputable that our grandparents have indeed played a very crucial role in transmitting the wisdom to successive generations . <p> Under this SAVE programme , students of member schools form SAVE committees within their own schools . Students of the school can select their own office bearers ( Student from Class V to Class XII can be members ) . Headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these committees chalk out plans and programmes for implementation within the school and the community outside .

 of integrated circuits has in recent years led to an increasing replacement of traditional metal layer deposition methods like chemical or physical vapour deposition ( CVD or PVD ) by atomic layer deposition ( ALD ) . ALD layers meet high standards with respect to layer closure and homogeneity and are used as diffusion barriers or dielectric layers . <p> Low Energy Ion Scattering ( LEIS ) has established itself as a technique for testing these thin layers . In LEIS , the sample surface is bombarded with noble gas ions of some keV energy . Due to scattering with top surface atoms a specific energy loss of the projectiles is observed that allows a quantitative determination of the elemental surface composition . Additionally , information on the layer thickness can be gained when projectiles undergo scatter processes in the subsurface . These unique properties make LEIS an ideal tool for the analysis of ALD processes . It can be used to determine the growth rate even for the first ALD cycle , to minimize the number of cycles for a pin hole-free layer closure and to evaluate the thickness variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data from that were produced after varying numbers of ALD cycles . The aim of this project in co-operation with ASM , a specialist in ALD , was to optimise the ALD process for the manufacturing of diffusion barriers that were as thin as possible , yet pin hole free . With the aid of LEIS , the element composition of the outermost atomic layer and the thickness of the ALD layer were determined quantitatively . The evaluation of the data resulted in the graph in figure 2 . It shows that the layer is closed after 50 ALD cycles . In addition the data make it possible to draw conclusions about the growth kinetics of the ALD layers . <p> GmbH was founded in 1997 as a testing laboratory specialising in Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry ( ToF-SIMS ) . Since then the company has not only developed into an internationally leading laboratory for this technology but also continues to contribute to its development .

 Gift of a Heart Attack this Holiday Season <p> Amid the frenzied pace of decorating , planning and shopping for the perfect holiday with family and friends , your health could let you down . Cold temperatures and the heightened stress brought on by these activities can trigger heart attacks or heart-related complications if left unchecked . <p> While cold weather is dependent upon Mother Nature , stress is a major contributor that everyone can and should control , says Dr. Nasser Lakkis , chief , Cardiology Department , Ben Taub General Hospital , part of the Harris County Hospital District in Houston , Texas . <p> " Stress and its many forms be it emotional , financial or physical can put undue pressure on your heart during a time that should be happy and joyous , " he says . <p> Whether it 's the stress of buying gifts , planning events , preparing meals , decorating houses or visiting family , your heart can only take so much . <p> " People do n't always understand that stress can be in anything you do , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's all in how you deal with things . If you know that a family gathering is going to be stressful , just say no to the conflict . Holidays should be fun and enjoyable . Family disputes or disagreements should be put off for later when the time is right . " <p> Stress , a common occurrence in everyday life , elevates adrenaline levels and can lead to increases in heart rate and blood pressure . The high levels of adrenaline also cause spasms in the arteries that supply blood to and from the heart muscle . If left unchecked , these symptoms can lead to a heart attack . <p> " While most heart attacks begin with subtle symptoms , they should not be ignored , " Lakkis says . " Do n't dismiss them or brush them off as other ailments like indigestion or anxiety . Heart attack symptoms vary widely from person to person . One person may have only chest discomfort while someone else may experience excruciating pain . " <p> To complicate matters more , holidays are a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy habits like taking prescription medicines , exercising regularly or eating well . They also tend to put off tale-tell signs of medical problems because of the holiday rush . <p> " Do n't , " Lakkis warns . " The greatest gift you could give your family and yourself is a healthy you , but it involves being responsible for yourself . " <p> Some recommendations to ease stress : <p> * Enjoy family gatherings and take them in stride . * If alone , reach out to friends or do volunteer work . * If concerned about finances , set and stick to a realistic budget . Large credit cards bills only delay your stress for later . * Stop or minimize the amount of alcohol you drink or tobacco you use . * Plan out activities and do n't dwell on the mishaps. * Say no . Do n't feel obligated to do things when you can't. * Be realistic about holiday expectations to avoid disappointment . <p> While men and women are equally susceptible to heart attacks , Lakkis says more heart attacks tend to occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The risk for a heart attack could increase with the addition of holiday stress if not careful . <p> " Wake up happy and see it as the great start to a beautiful day , " he says .

 to Phuket <p> A surge in tourist arrivals at Phuket International Airport in 2011 has been welcomed by many of the Islands hotels . However long passenger queues caused by extra international arrivals have been cause for concern ; what measures has the airport put in place to combat these problems ? <p> According to recent statistics from Phuket International Airport , the number of passengers at the airport had reached more than 5.6 million in the first eight months of 2011 . In August this year , Phuket International Airport had received a total of passenger arrivals and departures . <p> International arrivals and departures had also increased by 34.13% as compared to last year while domestic travel had increased by 9.14% . With a strong growth expected for the Phuket tourism industry , more airlines had launched new direct flights to Phuket . International flights to Phuket have increased by 25.48% this year . <p> Phuket 's airport is the second-busiest in Thailand , and the original plan in 2008 , was to expand the airport in stages , so that by 2018 , it can handle 12.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of tourist arrivals , expansion had to start earlier than planned .

 Most Advanced Semantic Technologies and Voice Solutions in the World <p> At CES 2016 , will show how the ODP S3 software platform enables the design of the most powerful and most intelligent speech dialog solutions and proactive assistant systems available today . <p> Imagine your car suggests booking a table for two at your favorite restaurant because it 's your anniversary . Or what about compiling a playlist with all your most loved rock songs from one year and play it in a certain order and volume by saying a single sentence ? Or you could program the heating in your sleeping room with just a few words instead of having to click tediously through the configuration menus . If all electrical systems in a smart home , car , or in the suite of a luxury cruise ship are to obey every single word , technology makes it possible . <p> With dialog and assistant systems based on ODP S3 technology ( ) all this and much more is n't a problem anymore . enables such systems to react and interact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show in Las Vegas , USA ( January 6-6 , 2016 ) , will show the most user-friendly Software Development Kit ( SDK ) for dialog applications , the OPD Workbench , with which our customers and partners can design their own intelligent control concepts based on speech and gesture input and integrate them into their products efficiently and at low cost . ODP S3 and the ODP Workbench allow our customers to build the most robust and advanced embedded , hybrid and cloud-based solutions that run on virtually any operating system for all kinds of branches . <p> Automotive solutions are capable of much more than recognizing speech and following simple commands within the currently activated domain like traditional systems ; they also carry out any possible command independent of the current context . It does n't matter if you 're in the navigation menu , or in the calendar view , for example : The Automotive HMI of the future allows the user to interact with the system across domains , even proactively like a true digital assistant in the infotainment periphery of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context knowledge and decides intelligently what the user really wants the system can also learn from user behavior , programming itself along the way . ODP S3 based solutions can even offer to perform tasks deemed important for the user in a certain context without being prompted . For example , they can notify the participants of an appointment in case a transport delay is foreseeable . The driver does n't have to concern him- or herself with finding out the names and matching phone numbers but is offered a range of options to contact the respective people . Such a system can , for example , compose an email and offer to send it . This reduces substantially the cognitive load of the driver and the risk of accidents . <p> In a Smart Home environment , ODP S3 is able to demonstrate its strengths , too . Instead of cumbersome menus that require multiple clicking on a tablet or other device in order to conduct a task , ODP S3-based systems offer intuitive and natural speech control . One sentence is enough and even complex commands are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use simply your voice for programming a recording on a certain channel at a specific time or to put together a playlist with advanced features such as " Compile a 25-song playlist with US Jazz songs from the 1960s , play it in order of the recording date ! " Or imagine you can set the radiator in a certain room to a certain level for a defined time frame : " Turn on the heating in the bedroom to level 5 on Sunday at 6 p.m. and off again at 8 p.m . " <p> But this is not where it stops ODP solutions can do much more . Even subsequent commands like ' Oh yes , and switch the light on there at 8 p.m. ! ' are understood . On the basis of the preceding interaction , they understand ' there ' as a reference to ' bedroom ' such intelligence is unique ! This highly comfortable way of control fully comes into effect for the first time with ODP S3 and will drastically increase the acceptance of smart home and home entertainment applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet of Things . <p> Please convince yourself of the incredible possibilities of our ODP Workbench and arrange an appointment with us at CES 2016 in Las Vegas .

 the local primary schools of your choice <p> You may already know which local primary school you want your child to go to , you may have no idea . You may have only just started looking or you may be on the verge of making a choice . Wherever you are at , it is important to ensure you have all the knowledge at your disposal to make the right decision . <p> So how do you go about choosing and what criteria are local primary schools using to make decisions as to who to offer places to ? <p> 1 . Decision makers - Local primary schools themselves do not decide who does and does not come to their school . This decision is taken at local authority level , so the school will have no influence in their intake save for trying to attract local children through open days and parent meetings . <p> 2 . Religion many local primary schools in the UK are denominational . That is , they follow a faith , usually because they are next to a church or in the parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary schools will use faith as a key part of their entry requirements usually in fact the number one item on the list for a faith school is acceptance into that faith . So if you have a Catholic school on your doorstep and you want your child to go there , then there is a good chance they will want your child to have been baptised into the Catholic faith . <p> 3 . Locality it may seem obvious , but local primary schools want local children . Next on the agenda for local authorities making decisions is their home address . If two children are vying for the same school place with identical backgrounds , then the one that lives in the school 's catchment area will get the place before one that does not . This is important to local primary schools because they are concentrated in residential areas in order to serve the needs of a community , unlike secondary schools which are less concentrated and serve a wider community as the children are much older and have the ability to travel there independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the centres of the communities in which they exist , will always favour family members over non-family members . So if an applicant has an older brother or sister in a school , then they are more likely to be accepted in a school than an applicant without a sibling at the school . This does n't mean that children without brothers or sisters will not get into the school of your choice , but it is worth considering in smaller communities where the primary schools are often quite small . <p> So whichever local primary schools you are considering for your child , it is always important to remember the chances of them getting accepted to go there will be influenced by many different factors , not just whether or not it is down the road from your house . It is always worth speaking to the school first and getting some input into how their selection criteria works . Every school will have a list of criteria which you can see to help you make the right choice . <p> Every local primary school in the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the Head Teacher 's name , the school postal address , and the school email address . You can now begin to make a shortlist of schools near you and assess the selection criteria of them all to make the right decision for your child . <h> Services <h> Thousands

 used as a binder in road construction along with other applications such as electronics , waterproofing for roofing , and in adhesives due to its resistance to water , insulation properties and high durability . The properties of bitumen can be altered by adding polymers to it , thereby increasing its application scope . Bitumen is known as " asphalt " or " asphalt cement " in North America . However , " asphalt " is a term used for a mixture of sand , small stones and other filler materials in the rest of the world . This mixture contains about 5% of bitumen . The mixture is known as " asphalt concrete " or more particularly " blacktop " in North America . Bitumen is available in a number of grades based upon the standard mentioned by certain tests such as penetration test . Bitumen 80/100 , bitumen 60/70 and bitumen 40/50 are the most commonly used bitumen , where the numerical values represent hardness of bitumen . Softer bitumen represents greater penetration units .

 <p> Belt drives have been used for more than 200 years for conveyance of materials and transmission of load . There are three basic types of power transmission belts -- flat belts , V-belts , and synchronous belts . Flat belts have a rectangular cross section and are efficient due to low bending losses , low creep , and high modulus of elasticity of traction layers . V-belts are trapezoidal in cross section and are used in industrial applications because of their relative low cost , ease of installation , and wide range of sizes . These belts work as friction-fit drive elements , using the friction between the belt and the pulley to transmit power . They have a higher power transmission capacity than flat belts as the slip between the belt and pulley is negligible , while the higher friction on the belt flanks substantially lowers the loads on the bearings . <p> Synchronous belts provide similar engagement as gears or chains , where the toothed profile meshes with corresponding grooves in the pulleys . They are used in applications where indexing , positioning , or a constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are used to drive camshafts , fuel injection pumps , balancer shafts , and water pumps . The new trend in the automobile industry is to downsize engines , thereby reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions . Downsizing of engines mandates the use of high horsepower engines . This has made rubber transmission belts crucial to automobile manufacturers . <p> Compared to chain drives , rubber transmission belts have low noise operation and stable and non-slippery drive . They do not require lubrication and are light in weight . Thus , rubber transmission belts help save energy . Transmission belts can be homogeneously made of rubber or they can be reinforced by aramid , steel , or nylon fibers for high strength applications . Different types of rubber materials are used depending upon the specific application environment . Synthetic rubber , a crude oil by-product , is widely used in transmission belt applications as compared to natural rubber . rubber transmission belts are flame resistant and are used for difficult working conditions such as underground mining pits . <p> Ethylene propylene diene monomer ( EPDM ) based rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ozone belts . They are used for high-temperature applications in foundries , cement works , steelworks , lime kilns , and brickworks . rubber transmission belts operate at high temperatures and are resistant to oil and grease . Silicone rubber belts are resistant to chemicals , greases , and oils and have an exceptional anti-adhesive effect . Styrene-butadiene rubber ( SBR ) transmission belts are resistant to abrasion and have good antistatic properties . Natural rubber transmission belts are used for general purpose applications and have low level of damping . Most transmission belts used in automobiles are made up of blends of the rubbers mentioned above . <p> The rubber transmission belt market is fragmented with a number of manufacturers scattered throughout the world . Asia Pacific is the largest manufacturer of rubber transmission belts with China being the dominant player in the market . Countries such as India , Thailand , and Malaysia use a significant proportion of natural rubber in their rubber belt formulations . However , since synthetic rubber prices have fallen in the last couple of years due to the drop in crude oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is set to rise in the countries mentioned above . <p> The U.S. is increasing its production of synthetic rubber belts as exploration of shale gas has led to a fall in prices of synthetic right . Among the consumers of rubber transmission belts , China is the leader , followed by the U.S. and Japan . Europe is witnessing a higher demand due to the increasing use of rubber transmission belts by automobile manufacturers in the region .
