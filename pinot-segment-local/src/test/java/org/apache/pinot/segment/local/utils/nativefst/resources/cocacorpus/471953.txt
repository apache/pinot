When he was a little boy , he used to play " waiter " with his brothers taking their orders and serving them lunch . Sadly , his playtime has become a reality and he has been wearing an apron pretty consistently since 1990 , working in restaurants in Denver , Houston and New York . In 2008 , he started a blog as a way to release the frustrations that come with being in the world of food service . Writing stories on the Internet about annoying customers was better than poking the annoying customers in their eyes with forks . <p> The Bitchy Waiter has appeared on television as a guest on Dr. Phil and has also been a guest commentator on CBS Sunday Morning . He has been interviewed by the New York Post , U.S. News and World Report , Huffington Post , Money Magazine , Bon Appetit and countless other food and beverage websites and magazines . <p> He enjoys The Brady Bunch , The Facts of Life and cocktails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was 15 , my father sent me to Waitress in a very busy coffee shop in downtown Chicago for the summer months when we did not have school . I used to come home and soak my feet and roll my quarters to give to my father . when the 3 months were over , I asked my Father why he would send me to work in a restaurant ? ? ? and He said " So you will never want to be a waitress " <p> You 're a bitch alright . Roasting " fans " whose comments offend you and feeling compelled to burn them by dedicating blog posts to them . How precious . How important that must make you feel . You 're so angry about being gay and working in the service industry , that your only release is attacking strangers who disagree with you . What a sad life you lead . Im flattered that you took so much time to analyze my comment line-by-line and dedicate a post to me . It was truly moving what a cunt you really are . Especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramen noodle-wannabe , frizzy curly wig you swing about , most inevitably leaving bits of DNA in your customers food . You 're not Justin Timberlake , circa 2000 sweetheart . You are a deplorable human being and I pray your tables are seated with bus loads upon bus loads of children . Go get a real job . Too bad being an asshole does n't  pay anything , you 're already excellent at that ! <p> Oh dear she 's not a happy lesbian at all . After 15 years in the hospitality industry I can attest to serving others as not only being a real job but one of the hardest , one that requires the largest amount of humility , patience and compassion and I now work with children who have multiple and profound learning difficulties ! If you do remember which blog upset this lady the most I 'd love to read it ! I think you 're blog is funny . People that defend the ridiculous expectations and sense of entitlement that the consumer has really fucking piss me off . I was fired once over a woman who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out we did n't  have sugar sachets because its ordered at the till . I think people should me made to do hospo as national service , maybe then they ; d get their sanctimonious heads out of their smug fat arses . <p> Get a real Job ? Seriously Lezbhonest you are the unhappy homosexual ! And being a pissed off lesbian does n't  give you the right to use the word Cunt like its an everyday term unless your a worthless piece of trash . I have been in the service industry for 36 yrs . I own my own home without a mortgage and drive a very nice new $35000.00 car . How is that not a real job ? I travel and hang with an amazing group of team players in a diner that serves over 1000 guests a day . <p> just came up this web site and your sorry a$$ reply Waaaaoooo I did not know they made people like you that size ( xxxxsm ) . Just to inform you waiting tables IS A JOB ! Earning an honest $dollar performing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doent pay enough . How about you get up and be a server at a coffee shop for a day ! see what it takes to deal with the public and their demands . <p> Thank you for this site . I work on the weekends as a server to help pay for the immense amount of medical bills attributed to my son who suffers from complex epilepsy . I have a BS in Architecture , and have given up my day job to be with my child and take him to necessary appointments with Neurologists , Pediatric specialistsetc . However , I am still treated like trash Friday Sunday . I have had people spell " salt " to me , avoid eye contact when placing orders , tap their glass after drinking 8 glasses of water in a half hour , ignore me to offer table service . I am shocked at how degrading people are , when they chose to go to a restaurant where table service is an accommodation . This site is a nice reminder that I do not suffer alone ! <p> Hope all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York B2B publication , Total Food Service . Would you like to contribute a column with your thoughts on the NYC restaurant industry eliminating tipping ? Would love to read your thoughts . We always here from the restaurant owners and associations , and would love opinions from professionals like yourself . <p> Dear BW , I LOVE reading your posts ! I have a situation at one of the restaurants I work currently and I would like to hear what you think . If I am in the wrong I want to know this as well . About 8 months ago we hired a 40 something guy as a dishwasher . He had never been in the restaurant industry . He was slow but a very hard worker . I really liked him . He was moved to a bus boy when a position opened up due to the other bus boys drinking on the job . At first he was slow at this as well but trying his best . All of the other servers complained about how when he was the busser , it was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own tables . About 4 months ago , it was if a switch was flipped because this guy went from being slow but working hard to not working much at all . An example of what I mean is as follows : during the rush a Saturday night instead of busting several dirty tables in every section of the restaurant you can find him polishing silverware in the back even though we have plenty of clean and polish silverware in every Side Station . Or with several dirty tables in every section he will be adjusting the booth by about an eighth of a centimeter so that they are aligned just right during a Saturday night Rush . one Sunday night he left a dirty table in my station for almost 45 minutes I had bussed several of my own tables but then I was given a party of 12 that included seven kids and this particular party was running me like no other which is the only reason I was unable to bus the last dirty table that I had yet to bus myself . When I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could please ask " Eric " to bus this table and I had also let the " manager " know that I had bussed , cleaned , and reset ALL my tables all night long so far . She found him polishing silverware and his response to why he had n't  bussed this table was because it was near the party This was a strange reason to me .. I as well as a few other servers have started to keep track of our tables and what we are doing compared to what he is doing . Obviously prebussing is our job an we all do it no problem . We are required to tip the bus boy 3% of our sales . We have found that the servers are doing 90% of this one bus boys job each shift . I have bought this up to management . I am the only one who is courageous enough to bring an issue to Managements attention . An now I am being written up for " stirring the pot " I feel like this one guy has decided that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows that it is policy that he is going to be handed over 3% of our sales regardless of whether or not he earned it or not . He also does n't  do the other support work most busser do such as stock bread plates , glasses etc . We all end up doing this as well . Aside from you telling me to get a new job , what is your take on this issue ? <p> I 'm surely a big fan of Don , his fantastic performance and charming smile can always cheer my day up , please provide every possible information of Don on this blog , thanks for the hard work for running this , great job ! <p> peachskin . I actually prefer the shiny , silky satin to all materials that Ive encountered so far , so I 'd actually be interested in that if that was it . The normal peachskin would be a little less smooth and not really that shiny ; obviously one I would n't prefer . <p> Hi BW , would like your opinion on this . A party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in a Burger King bag of burger &amp; fries . This really bothers me , I do n't  know if my state has any health codes for this , but if it does n't  it should . with all the food borne illness going around is n't this a potential health risk bringing in prepared food from another establishment ? What is your opinion on this . Thanks for your time ! <p> I love every single thing about your blog . Been reading your stuff for years and check your FB page on a daily basis . Coming home to a glass ( or five ) of wine and reading your posts always makes a shitty day so much better . You 're spectacular , please never stop bitching about serving , ever . xoxoxo <p> So glad to see someone else appreciating how amazing curtains are ! I make made to measure clothing and the majority are made from curtains and my customers love it ! I 've made everything from a shirt for my Dad to dresses to cushions to skirts , all from curtains . Some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day the curtains started life out as just a piece of fabric like everything else , why should it matter it 's been something else in between ? I call it their rebellious stage ! You can see what I 've made on my page **44;0;TOOLONG x <p> that its because we live in society that is called " feudal-patriarchal " or the belief that men owns women , so in domestic violence , the home is a mans castle thus anything that happens within the home is an internal problem or problem of the man . of course that belief seems old fashion but its still very prevalent . our law on domestic violence which is the RA 9262 recognizes that domestic abuse is a public crime so anyone can interfere or file a complaint . its just that most people still think of abuse as private so they prefer to disregard the law . kainis lang diba ! 
@@106055088 @1455088/ <h> The One Thing Parents Need To Do With Their Kids in Restaurants : <p> The blog post I am about to write is not my first one about children and we all know it will certainly not be my last one unless destiny reaches down from the heavens and makes me breathe my last breath today . Actually , this post is more about the parents and how I am in desperate need of them to grow some fucking balls and learn how to reprimand their children and accept that if they do , their kids might be upset with them . Stop using me as your bad cop . I may not care about your kids , but that does n't  mean that I want to be the one to teach them manners . <p> I 'm sure the following scenario , or one very similar to it , - has happened to all of us : <p> Some little half-pint asshole is running through the restaurant like a chicken with his head up its ass . The parents are too busy to control the little hellion because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numb their senses and forget the day they thought it was a good idea to have sex without a condom . As Mom slurps down the last ounce of brandy and sucks on an ice cube and Dad- tries to- squeeze out- one more- drop of bourbon from a- muddled orange slice , their child is three booths away having a conversation with another couple who just want to have a night away from their own kids . As the child slowly meanders closer to its semi-drunk parents , it is distracted by the iPhone it is holding . The child promptly sits on the- floor in the middle of the dining room in order to play whatever stupid fucking game was downloaded on its behalf . This is when a server , holding tray of food , walks from the kitchen and narrowly misses the drooling pile of three-foot high human . When the server stumbles slightly and barely saves the food on the tray , the Mom looks up with her glazed-over eyeballs and sees that it was her- offspring that was the cause of the potential disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sloth on antihistamines . <p> " Crotch Fruit , sweetie ? - Time for you to come sit down . Our food is here . " she slurs . <p> The child makes its way to the parents as the server is placing the plates onto the table . <p> " You have to sit down at the table because you were almost in our waiters way . If you keep running around the restaurant like that , you 're going to make him mad , is n't that right Mr. Waiter ? " <p> Okay , this pisses me off . Do n't  put me in the position of being the bad guy because you cant take the responsibility that comes with- being a demanding parent . Why do so many parents- ask that- their children to do something in order to please some person that the child does not even know ? I hear it all the time : " Asshole , Jr. , you better stop screaming or the pilot is going to get upset with you and kick you off the airplane " or " Vaginal Surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supermarket lady is never going to let you come grocery- shopping with me again . " <p> How about , parents , you say something like this to your kids : " If you do n't  stop acting like a damn fool , I am going to be pissed off . Me , your parent . I 'm the only one you should be trying to please and I do n't  give a shit if Mr. Waiter , the pilot or Supermarket Lady is upset with you . They cant punish you , but I can . Listen to what I tell you and do as I say because I 'm your- goddamn parent and if you do n't  like it when Im mad at you , tough fucking titty . " Or something like that . <p> My point is that I do n't  like when parents try to make me enforce rules so they can get the behavior they want from their child and still smell like a rose when I end up looking like the asshole and smelling like fajitas . Do your job , parents . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but enough with the trying to make it look like I am the one who wants them to act like civilized human beings . You want it too and it might be a good thing if your kids know that . Be a parent so I can be your server . <p> One time I offered a table dessert ( I work at a Mexican restaurant and we make homemade paletas ) and the mom actually got mad at me because then her kid wanted a red-pop . Lady , its not my job to tell your kid he cant have dessert . It IS my job to sell you delicious organic popsicles . I 'll do my job ; you do yours . <p> i AM NOT A BABYSITTER , YOU ARE A PARENT . ACT LIKE ONE . my father used to look at me and ask if I wanted to go outside . ARE YOU KIDDING ? If I did n't  cut my own switch big enough , my uncle would do it for me . And he worked on oil rigs. 19 years in service has taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or at least , do n't  bring them to a fucking restaurant before they 're old enough to behave . <p> These kid posts always remind me of a shift I had on either Easter or Mothers Day a hundred years ago . A couple came in with their hideous ( no really , the kid was hideous ) toddler , and proceeded to throw what looked like a Navy dufflebag full of toddler-related sh*t on the table . This was a VERY busy shift and in order to maximize profits , the owner put more tables in the dining room , so moving around for us servers was very tight . <p> Finally , when Uglycias parents food came out , I had no choice but to pass it to them over their self-made pile of toddler crap . Uglycias mommy than wasted 10 minutes of my shift telling me all the ways I could have hurt Uglycia by passing that plate so close to Uglycia . Yeah , right , that was my fault . Mom really should have reflected on the fact that a hot plate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The worst one Ive heard is a mom who used to tell their kids to behave at the doctors office , or else the doctor would give them a shot . And then , when the doctor was ready to give them a vaccine , the kid would freak the fuck out because they WERE behaving , and were going to give them a shot anyway . <p> When parents said I would be mad at their kid , I would smile at the kid and say " AW I could never be mad at you ! you are just too sweet ! " and walk away . Did n't  matter if the kid was being a raging shit ball , I was not going to be his parents scape goat . <p> Parents say these things , not because they do n't  want to seem like a bad guy to their child but because their child do n't  listen to them . The child will listen to others or fear others because they do n't  know what that person will do . Lol , its a shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a server for over 30 years , but as a customer , OMFG . I spend a large part of so many meals out sending death stares at parents who let their effing children stand on the furniture . DO YOUR CHILDREN STAND ON THE SEATS AT HOME ? ! ? Did n't  they just walk from the car through the same parking lot full of spit , bird crap and god knows what ? And you let them stand on the seats . Worst are the ones in the next booth who are not only standing on the bench , but turned around facing me . Little puke faced brats , chewing with their mouths open , because they all chew with their mouths open now . <p> The idiots who do n't  just LET the baby have the sugar caddy to play with , but who actually GIVE the baby the sugar caddy . Usually , they dump it out on the table and floor , but whatever does n't  go there goes in their mouth . So , after they leave , it all goes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back next time , and we have raised our prices to cover this sort of fuckery , they will bitch loudly . Let 's not even discuss all the germy hands that touch the sugar caddies every day , and you let your kid put it their mouth . PARENTING-YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG ! <p> I remember working at an amusement park dealing with that ki d of stuff cause the stand I worked at sold alcohol and " italian " inspired dishes . We ( teenagers to college age mind you ) had to carry 3 year olds out from where we worked and the kitchen cause the parents would worry about guzzling their beer . We had one parent have their 4 year old daught CARRY their WINE to the table ! We had 2 empty booths behind where the beers and registers were and we 'd have moms who thought they owned the world fight us for those seats during rushes . Well sorry maam we have wine and beer next to us , we do n't  want any lawsuits . When I worked at Panera it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their orders down our throats , to the point their children had to tell them they were being too bossy .

Based on the posting that was placed on the front door , this manager must have heard every excuse under the Rooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity Sun , because every base is covered to keep out the crappy employees . I hid the phone number so they are n't  inundated with calls from people desperate to serve up some Raspberry Sweet Cream Cheese Crepes and Bacon Crusted Chicken Breasts . <p> Please do not apply if you oversleep , have court often , do not have a babysitter every day , have to get rides to work later than our work day begins , experience flat tires every week , have to hold a cell phone all day , or will become an expert at your job with no need to take advice after the first day . Must be able to talk and work at the same time . Must also remember to come back to work after lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . If you qualify leave name and number at ( 206 ) ***-**** . <p> Some people may think this is the kind of manager they would not want to work for , but to me it sounds like a dream scenario . I hate when I bust my ass to get to work on time every day and some lazy waitress drags her ass in late very other day with another brilliant excuse . ( Shout out to my friend Todd who once showed up late to his job at Dillard 's department store carrying his muffler under his arm claiming that it fell off his car . ) I say thank you to this manager for weeding out all the wrong people right from the get go . It saves everyone a lot of time . No employer wants to learn that you have child care issues after they have put you on the schedule . No employer wants to get a text message thirty minutes before the shift begins because you are in court again this week . And most impressively , no employer wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those are exactly the kinds of employees I do n't want to work with and that 's why I think this job posting is straight up brilliant . It 's also straight up bitchy , so I love it for a lot of reasons . You might not get a gold star for working there , but I give one to whoever printed this out and taped it to the front door of IHOP . <p> What do you think ?

I work part time and when someone does n't  show . The rule at our pub is " no call , no show , no job " . Some employees do n't  believe it , but they find out soon enough . I love this sign ! <p> This is AWESOME ! Iff been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day taken to give to a new girl . I 'm the only one who has called out 3 times in 2 years , stays late , and comes in on my days off cause no one else will . But they 're the ones that keep their shifts . And I 'll deep clean the restaurant , ( booths , chairs , ice machine , register area , ect ) but yet I 'm treated like garbage . This is deff the kind of manager I 'd want to work for . Seems like he or she wont put up with bull shit . Lol . Btw , i LOVE LOVE LOVE your blog . Xoxo <p> Hey Sarah . I thought I was the only fool . Just kidding . I 'm not a fool . Just trying to survive in hostile work env . My asshole of a boss harrases me for things that were done on my days off . Go figure Someone did n't  stock the cups I was off 2 days guess who is grilled about it . One day I will have to cut that he-bitch Joker size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order wrong . Guess who gets blamed ? <p> Wished I would have had an employer like this when I was busting my ass as a waitress .. Was always there doing double shifts every damn day of the week so others could call in *sick* so they could party . Got treated like shit , but still did my job . And when I really needed a day off for something generally pretty important which was n't often mind you . I could n't have those days . Please train more managers like this . Is send them my way . <p> Well minimum wage in SeaTac is $15 . Plus tips so I think its very reasonable to expect a level of commitment and competency equal to the level of pay . More power to him . I am surprised however that there is not an outcry about discrimination lol <p> And now I 'm trying to figure out how to move to SeaTac ! Lol Jeez that 's just being an adult with a job , and in Tn we get $2.13/hr + tips serving and I made $5/hr + tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frikkin love your blog ! You are my male bitchy equivalent ! <p> As a manager this is the same thing I tell people during an interview . I tell them right up front that I am blunt , will not deal with bullshit , and if they are unable to be an adult that the door is right up front . I love my employees and find that when they realize I wont let anyone bring the team down that they are happier , more efficient , which makes customers happy . <p> Ah bitchy waiter .. I am so pleased to see you making this go viral . I had worked at this store . My old manager posted that sign . Now I know I was n't a perfect employee but I work my ass off . When I worked there we had alot of the issues listed . I suppose he s just had it with the shenanigans lol .. The area is horrible and doing the early morning with street crud coming in , was not fun , who wants to wake up to drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pancakes .. And no appreciation whatsoever .. Treat your employees a bit better maybe theyd actually want to work and do a good job . juat sayin And yes he is a fucking savage . <p> What is with people at work texting on their phones . I was waiting to put an order in and the employee was texting on their phone ignoring me standing there . It couldnt have been anything that important because she was smiling as her fingers text away . I finally walked away and went to another store to purchase over $45.00 dollars of merchandise I had in my cart . I hope the girl with the phone at least put away what I left in the cart because melted ice cream can ruin the frozen pizza and pack of hamburgers that were at the bottom . <p> For 30 years I tried to be this kind of manager . I always wanted what was fair for everyone . Restaurant work is really all about teamwork and when one person does n't  carry their share , its not fair to the rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can to protect the slackers because they are afaid of litigation . In many cases my hands were tied and I was left standing there looking like an idiot because you can not discuss it in public . That bad behavior can ruin the teamwork in restaurant in no time . <p> Yup , love it . Problem at my current job is , manager loves to hire her personal friends and relatives . Some of them are good workers , but are mean and nasty to the other workers bc they know they can get away with it . Others , not so great , and still consistently get shifts after no show/no calling SEVERAL times , show up to work looking unkempt and dirty , and just in general not very good at their jobs . In the meantime , the good but unrelated workers get treated unfairly , and lose shifts so she can hire more relatives in the middle of slow season . She will also assign large parties to only her friends and relatives , regardless of whether it was their turn or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those people , as the rest of it , including myself , have had it . I 've already been hired by another place , the owner met me thru my current job and asked me to come work for her . Since she is a fair boss , we are just waiting for slow season to end so her current workers are n't  giving up shifts for me . So , in another monthhasta ! and good luck with that !

Have you ever even worked at a restaurant ? Do you know how frustrating it is when someone uses past coverage or their dumb kids as an excuse not to work ? He had ACTUAL PLANS . You must have been mad Kevins party started after 10 . <p> I have a part-time non-restaurant job in addition to my part-time serving job . I basically wait tables once or twice a week . I pick up extra shifts pretty regularly , too , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered . I feel like everyone forgets that I work 30 hours a week somewhere else . I guess they think I 'm a kept woman = so I get where you 're coming from . And I do n't  hold all those shifts I cover over everyones head ! <p> This issues is n't black and white . If you want to switch or give away a shift because you do n't  feel like working , that 's one thing . If you have something important come up which requires you to miss work ( like a funeral ) and NO ONE wants to do it , but there is one individual who said they would do it just to help you out , then YES , you owe them . I agree something like a birthday that you have advanced notice that its approaching , should be requested off . But emergencies do happen , and if your co-workers are able to help you with it , then it should be remembered and returned . Or you can be one of those **31;46;TOOLONG co-workers type of person and watch what happens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proper reason why he could n't cover Kevins shift and after he told him Kevin decided to be a douche about it . Fuck Kevin , we swap shifts all the time where I work and no one holds it over anyone . Its the way its meant to be ! <p> In the world of hypotheticals . Maybe Kevin has spent the last few months in a drug induced stopper in his off time , thus leaving him unable to track the days leading up to his birthday . Can you imagine ? ? Waking up next to a woman in her late 50s name Bernice , covered in cheezwhiz and reeking of Bourbon and shame , only to look up at the Calander and realize you 're birthday is just around the corner , and the schedule for the week has already been posted . Oh the tragedy . Oh the Calamity . Maybe Kevin does n't  need the day off for his birthday . Hed probably only repeat the cycle . Maybe for his birthday , everyone should pitch in for Kevins intervention . " Surprise ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk " <p> I HATE that guy . Its one thing for an emergency , but another for a birthday . I get not wanting to work on your birthday , but YOUR OWN birthday is not a surprise . How do you not have the foresight to request that off months in advance ? <p> I agree with all the people who asked whether or not Kevin knew his birthday was coming up . I work at a factory and all advance vacation time requests for the following year are put in the first week of Dec . I know when my birthday is , if I want that day off I 'd better damn well ask for it . If I want time at the last minute I may or may not get it depending on other peoples requests . <p> Beautiful , I 'll be dead drunk in Copenhagen that same night , the 27th , taking a well earned break from Norway , work , gym and kickbox training , i.e. ordinary f**king days spent still missing the beaches , gin &amp; tonic and sangrias in Albufeira Portugal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working years ahead and come to me ! ! ! I 'll raise a glass to you and Kevin from there , thanx for the blog ! <p> That crap happens all the time where I work . People think because you need a swap once you owe them your immortal soul . We have a Kevin here too this girl thinks because you swap once with her you owe her 3 swaps . Screw you hippie not how it works . I used to swap all the time until I needed a day off and magically no one could swap . Sorry but you have to think of yourself sometimes .

If not in your section , then someone elses . Be strong for all those two-tops . <p> A guy will ask his server to put an engagement ring in the food . <p> Someone will show up forgetting it 's Valentine 's Day and get pissed off that it 's crowded . <p> A lady will order her regular menu item only to learn that it 's prix fixe only and either not available or twice as much as usual . <p> A waitress will give Hershey 's kisses to all of our tables hoping it will increase her tip average . <p> Someone will break up with someone because they figure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may as well crush it completely and do it on Valentine 's Day . <p> A girl will have to pretend that she loves her gift of a teddy bear , chocolate candy or balloons . <p> Someone will show up at the restaurant alone , forgetting its Valentines Day and get trashed because the closest thing they have to a long term relationship is their affair with tequila . <p> Something will be served in the shape of heart because nothing says true love like a heart-shaped pizza . <p> Someone will try to convince someone else that fake , plastic roses that light up are romantic . <p> A server will make bank and walk out of the restaurant with a shit ton of money . 
@@106055112 @1455112/ <p> Hi , my name is Gary , behind the bar everyone calls me Chic . I 've have been behind the stick and floor for 32 years , and I have enjoyed every second of it . Unfortunately a car accident ended my career . When behind the bar one of my biggest pet peeves was organization and professionalism . I was so tired of fumbling for my opener that I hand made a holster for my wine key . I 've used it for 20 years , so I decided to share my Idea . Please go to probar10der.com and place your order <p> Hey , Bitchy , First off , LOVE YOU ! ! ! Is there an email address where I can send you something ? My local newspaper had an ad about what to expect if you eat out o Mothers Day . I think you 'd get a kick out of it ( especially since it was above the ad for a restaurant ! ) . I have it as a pdf and cant post it to your page . 
@@106055118 @1455118/ <h> I Want Banks to Send THIS Text Alert <p> Okay , okay , I fucked up and you guys let me know it . A few days ago , I reached into the bottom of the barrel and wrote a post about a text alert that a bank sent out when a restaurant tip seemed overly generous . I complained that it was n't the bank 's business if someone wanted to leave a 37% tip and they should kindly take their text alert and shove it up their safety deposit box . Plenty of people shared stories about unscrupulous servers who might write in their own generous tips after a customer left . Others mentioned how a server could have made a mistake and accidentally entered the wrong amount . The bank was doing what they thought best to protect their client 's money . Most people thought the bank was doing the right thing and most people thought I was more wrong than an order of guacamole that was made mayonnaise . <p> I was wrong and I can admit that . It 's not easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? The bank was just trying to be a good financial institution and I apologize to all banks , for they are truly wonderful and have never and will never do anything except care about their customers . ( Just typing that almost made the margaritas I had last night come back up . ) <p> But then , still trying to figure out what I could write about , I had an epiphany . So maybe it was wrong of me to come down on the bank for someone overtipping a server , but how great would it be if they sent an alert for leaving a bad tip ? Think about it ! Any time someone left a dark , greasy , skidmark of a tip on a credit card , the bank could send a text alert that said : <p> Hey , asshole . We noticed you gave an extra shitty tip on April 27 , 2017 , for your service at Restaurant . <p> We hope you left this tip by accident because that 's not even 10% , dick . If it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to do except think about how much servers hate you . <p> You can contact Restaurant directly if you need to fix this shit . <p> Now this is a text alert from a bank that I can fully support and I bet all of you will as well . Again , sorry I screwed up the last post . I could blame it on the tequila , but tequila is my friend and I would never throw a friend of mine under the bus . <p> Every time I read about waiters bitching about tips , I feel sorry they are such total failures in life that they do n't  realize that better jobs exist that they could be happier . Such a shame they waste their life away where if they had any sense and skills at all , they could step up to a nice sanitation engineer job or maybe even become a pig slopper ! Better things and times are in your future if only you just open your eyes ! Good luck and good tips to all of you ! <p> Justin , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their asses to make sure that your dining experiences are such total failures and that we waste our lives away doing things that apparently you are too incompetent to do for yourself . Some of the most amazing servers and cooks who waste their lives catering to lazy pieces of shit like you , whom I 'm guessing , cant even figure out how to make a box of kraft macaroni and cheese without burning the water , are some of the most educated individuals I have ever had the opportunity to know . And without people like myself , where would you take the " important " people in your life to brag about your bloated ego and prove your dominance in society ? Get the fuck over yourself cunt muffin . Hop onto your pathetic little douche canoe and paddle the fuck away . I hope for your sake ( not really ) that you never wind up in a restaurant of mine . Narrow minded little TWAT . Maybe someday I 'll become a high society member of the pig slipping community like you , but until then , I 'll just keep on keeping on . 
@@106055119 @1455119/ <p> When my kids were little and we went out to restaurants , I always tried to make sure I cleaned up any and all messes they made . I picked up every scrap of food that hit the floor , I wiped off the table , and I stacked up our empty dishes as neatly as possible . I still try to leave the table neatly , because I 've always felt that its disrespectful to leave a mess for someone else to clean up . The servers job is to take my order and serve my food , not to clean up an unholy mess . I also believe people should tip in cash if they can , in case the restaurant takes a cut of the tip if its put on a card . And any server who has to deal with children deserves a little extra for being patient . I 'm just sorry everyone does n't  think this way . <p> I was a bitchy waiter yesterday . After 11 years of waiting tables in a 4 diamond resort . I work breakfast and dinner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family of 5 with three toddlers and 3 high chairs , I was the back server ( busser ) that day . After the family left , I proceeded to follow the mother and told her that she might of left the kids milk on the table and that they left the table a complete mess . She followed me back to the table and saw the milk and I took the chairs away from the table so that she can see the mess . Her response was " oh there 's my milk " and saw the mess . The husband then attacked the manager on for 15 minutes and wanted to know why I told them that they left a mess . eggs , crayons , toast , syrup , all over the floor and table . The husband said " does he not like his job " the manager stated he is one of the best servers we got ! My co-workers were surprised yet upset they all have kids or grandkids .

Really ! ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean the floor and table then sanitize , let alone the other guest who needed to be seated or guest already seated next to them .

Im Toast ! ! ! <p> I get very small childrens attempts to feed themselves but after a few tries the parents need to step in and add some control to the feeding . We ate with manners in my childhood home and we did the same when my daughter was small . The parents need to realize they do not abdicate their parent duties just because their is a server/busser/support staff for the restaurant . Are they pigs at home ? I think not .

She could not , for the life of her , figure out how they got shrimp when there was no shrimp to be found anywhere on the menu . She had become completely heartbroken in the 30 second it took me to drop the menus and pour 2 iced teas over the lack of shrimp on the menu , as I had not yet regurgitated the special to her .

Again , I do n't  have kids , but that 's what Ive heard . Surely there are times when a parent secretly wishes that they could just put their baby in a crate , go out to dinner and then come home two hours later , give it some water and take it out for a walk . That seems to work great for my dog . Or maybe there are times when the baby wants to stay home but the parents drag it out anyway . This may have been the case last night when a couple had dinner with their horribly sick child . Looking at that babys eyes , they seemed to be saying , " Bitch , I just wan na be at home with some Saltines , ginger ale , a National Enquirer and Oprah .

Making my way to the spill zone , I saw another server in the dish room wiping down a high chair .

" That is some weird looking milk , right ? I said . He replied . " Oh , its not milk . The baby threw up all over everything . " He began to clean it up as I slowly removed myself from the situation . I do not clean up vomit . ( Unlike this super hero . ) And then I wondered why the fuck Moe asked me to clean up the " milk " when he knew it was fucking baby puke .

The poor little baby looked miserable : watery eyes , a crusty snotty nose and a cough that sounded like it belonged to a senior citizen who smoked a pack of Pall Malls every day for the last 80 years . Once , I think I saw her cough up a piece of baby lung . She quickly ingested it again . It may have been a piece of the Caesar salad her mother was feeding her , but I will just go ahead and say I am 99% sure it was baby lung . Meanwhile , the parents continued having a gay old time while their baby continued to hold down vomit and cough up body parts . <p> They had a two-top open next to them that I refused to seat anyone at , because I know that nobody wants to sit next to a sick baby and a bag of clothes that smell like vomit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much every day so you would think we would be used to it , but were not .

But at least Mom and Dad got to go out to eat on a Friday night and good for them . I do n't  get parents who can ignore the needs of their kids like that .

No matter how much you dislike your food , the service , the bartender , whatever , resorting to personal attacks is a sign of a miserable , mean-spirited person . And what someone does for a living is not who they are as a person . Many young servers are working their way through college ; many older servers have been doing it their entire working lives because they 're excellent at it ; others are just trying to supplement their income , because good paying jobs with benefits are hard to find these days . Do n't  resort to name calling , just because your ass wasnt kissed as much as you thought it should have been . <p> Sue I agree with you 100 0/0 Ive been on both sides .

We have to learn to concentrate on the good . <p> I 'm relatively new at serving and got my first horrible yelp review today . The table said I was a terrible and rude waitress who purposely sabotaged their appetizer , served mediocre food and slammed their plates down . I spilled a glass of water also which I apologized for and tried to bring them replacement food that they still hated .

@@106055158 @1455158/ <h> Woman Does Not Understand How Menus Work <p> Someone needs to understand how menus work and I am here to provide this valuable lesson . In a Facebook review of Venue Restaurant &amp; Lounge , a woman named Jen is upset that she could n't have burgers even though they were not on the menu . They are on the lunch menu , but not the dinner menu and Jen was there at night . <p> We tried to order takeout food tonight . All we wanted were two burgers and a bowl of soup but were told we could n't get burgers because they are n't  on your dinner menu . I understand not advertising them on your dinner menu because you want people to buy the higher priced items , however good customer service would be still allowing it upon request since you have the stuff to make it . Plus , we were ordering takeout so it was n't like we were taking up a table on a busy Friday night for a couple of burgers and soup . Needless to say we took our business to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with service , food , etc . We generally dine in about once a month , sometimes more and have never had a complaint . I probably should n't let one bad experience speak for all the other good ones but I 'd be lying if I said I plan on coming back often . <p> Jen , do n't get your ground beef craving panties in a twist over this . This is not a good reason to give them one star , especially since you claim to have been there numerous times and never had any issues . Question : out of those many times that you went to Venue and enjoyed the service , did you ever take the time to write a 5-star review ? Yeah , I did n't think so . But the moment they do n't bend the rules and bow down to your entitled hamburger needs , you go straight to Facebook to trash them . Lame , Jen . Real lame . <p> There was a reason they could not give you your hamburger and it made no difference that you were having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any food in kitchen that will not be needed for dinner is removed from the vicinity . That means that your hamburger buns , lettuce and tomato set ups , hamburger patties , etc. were not there ready to be made for you , Jen . That food was in the walk-in , maybe downstairs even , already wrapped up and ready to go for the next day . Or maybe they did n't even have any patties because they are prepared in the morning for lunch service . Also , there was probably no place to cook your precious patties because the grill was occupied with other food items that were , you know , on the freaking menu . <p> If something is n't on the menu and they wo n't make it for you , that is n't bad customer service . It 's just how restaurants work . Menus are created with purpose and the purpose is to tell you your options . To ask for something that is n't on the menu is entitled , presumptuous and rude . And then to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefensible . <p> There is your lesson , Jen . I hope you can digest it as easily as you can a hamburger and I also hope you will take down your pointless 1-star review . Have fun at Lazlos . I 'm sure they 're thrilled to have you <h> 9 thoughts on " Woman Does Not Understand How Menus Work " <p> &lt;3 Good idea ! Be sure to make it a vegetarian pizza with a gluten-free crust just to maximise your entitlement . And do n't forget to threaten a 1-star review and a nastygram on Yelp ! about how you 've been discriminated against by their failing to offer you enough vegan options ! Film this all on your phone and send it to me , because I want to see it ! = <p> *Oh , and tell the waiter it 's all a jibe at people who really DO this sort of thing and then leave him a 40% tip , lol . He 'll forgive you . <p> Better tip 100% for having to take the time to listen and deal with the pointless noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of douchebaggery can ruin a server or bartenders shift , and the hostile atmosphere can quickly become contagious in that type of setting . Regardless of how much you tip .. at the end.when you 're done with your pretty prank . <p> This happens to me nearly every shift . The restaurant I 'm at is tiny , 12 tables tiny , and there 's no way we would have room in the kitchen to serve burgers alongside steaks for dinner . When people ask , I just apologize and explain that our kitchen is smaller than the dining room and everything gets swapped out at lunch . " So , I cant get a burger ? " No , you can get what 's on the menu . <p> Who teaches people there 's some " secret menu " to order from ? If its not there its not available . Easy peasy . <p> This happens all the time in our restaurant ! People ask for things they had 5yrs ago ( that have been removed from the menu ) and get upset when we CANT make them the dish . Literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case they happen to drop in . Smh . <p> I use to have an asshole like this come in every week and demand a lunch item for dinner ( always on a Friday night dinner rush ) he claimed we can make it because we make it for lunch , this was an item that required hand made dough grilled then baked in our brick oven , it needed prep time , not something that was made to order , it was prepped in the morning and once they were gone that was it . He would scream and yell and throw fits , call the manager over , threaten to call corporate . Biggest douche Ive ever had to serve , they finally removed it from the menu and never saw his bitch face again ! ! ! 
@@106055164 @1455164/ <h> Halloween at the Restaurant <p> Last Thursday , my boss let us know if we wanted to wear a costume to work on Halloween , we were more than welcome to . He did not give us any rules , stipulations or requirements and because he was so free with his words , I am determined to take full advantage of it . Working in a costume can be challenging , but if I can wear a Darth Vadar costume in 1977 South Texas when the temperature was 90- , I can handle anything . I had on my dad 's black motorcycle helmet over my grocery store mask and costume . My plastic cape made me sweat and the boots were way too big , but I never once dropped character . If I can do that as ten-year old , I can certainly handle a costume as a 46-year old . And something about being 46 and discussing a Halloween costume makes me feel incredibly grateful for my youthful nature or incredibly sad about the state of my life . I have not decided what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a five options : <p> - A Bennigan 's waiter from 1991 . All I need to do is pull out some old khakis and a bright polo shirt and go for it . The pant legs will need to be pegged just above my black high-tops with neon shoelaces . If only I still had my rainbow suspenders ala Mork and Mindy ! Yes , I really did have a pair in 1983 along with over 100 buttons that I collected . I was a total loser and even wore one for my senior photo that said " Why Be Normal . " <p> Why be normal ? <p> This costume would be fun to wear because I could go up to tables and squat down at them to take their orders . I could see if anyone would like to start of with some crispy potato skins . I could cover myself in flair and wrap a bandanna around my leg . We already listen to 80s music at work so it would n't be a stretch . <p> Flo from Alice . I 've done it . I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem with this costume is that have a lot of sidework to do when I get to work and I really am not too keen on mopping the damn floor while wearing pantyhose . Also , I think if I showed up to work in full out drag , my boss would not know how to handle it . Even though I have worked there for almost three years , he knows nothing about me and I think when he said we could wear costumes , he thought we would show up in a silly hat . Still , to be Flo while waiting tables is kinda amazing . <p> Kiss my grits ! <p> Telling people to kiss my grits is fun even without the Flo costume so how much fun would it be with it ? Still , hauling up that mop bucket from the basement might make my makeup run and nobody wants to see that . <p> Little Orphan Annie . Okay , it was Annie in the later years , as I imagined her to be after growing up after years of hard knocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bruises all over her legs and panties that came off easily if you asked her nicely . Sandy was dead but she still carried him around because she needed that familiarity . The best thing about that costume was that I got to use my own hair . <p> Its a hard knock life . <p> I have a feeling the restaurant will have a lot of kids in it on Halloween since we are right int he middle of a great neighborhood for trick or treating . Some parents may take offense at my version of Annie . And my fake boobs get hot . <p> The Hamburgler . This costume is one from a few years ago but somehow oddly appropriate for waiting tables in . Every time someone orders french fries , I could show up to their table with half of their order hanging out my mouth . I would be so adorable while doing to that no one would complain about it . Of course , wearing a mask may make it difficult to be at work safely . My peripheral vision would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , more importantly , see where I am keeping my own . <p> Hamburgler <p> I think my tables would like this one the most and its all about making my customers happy , right ? <p> Old Waiter . Yes , this one is the easiest costume to put together because I wear it every day of my life . However , I am thinking of dusting off my old cater waiter tuxedo and covering my face with some old age make up . ( " Older age make up , you mean , " says everyone who knows me ) . Or maybe I could wear this black wig that I used once for a Goth party I went to and I could just be this weird Riff Raff from Rocky Horror . Throw a little black under my eyes and put on a pair of white gloves . Or maybe I could be like Lurch from The Addams Family . Or maybe I can make blood drip out of my eyes ( they will already be bloodshot , so its perfect ) and just be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probabably be the winner because it seems like the easiest one to pull together and the best one to be working in . <p> What about you ? Will you be wearing a- costume to your job on Thursday ? Are there any other middle-aged men out there who still cling to their childhood by wearing silly costumes to their job ? If you wear a costume , I hope you will , share it with us all on the Facebook page . Please let me know I am not the only immature asshole who thinks its alright to dress up to go to work . <p> I just got laid off so no costume at work . My annual blow out Halloween party was this weekend , as was a friends , and I was Cercei Lannister for both . Loved that costume . I got to wear jewels and a crown . ( ok the tiara from my wedding but still ! Its huge and very crown like and was made by the guys who make Miss Americas crown .. hubby knew themso close enough ! ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all of our hot dogs got a theme ( we have a Date Dog , a New Yorker , a Horny Dogand it goes ) . Each waiter had to choose which hot dog he want to dress up asIll be the 4th of July , wearing blue&amp;reds ribbons , and probably the Constitution stapled in my back . Its my first time working&amp;dressing upgot to be good ! <p> Being from houston my vote is bennigans waiter . But then flo was mentioned and my thoughts went to bitchy would be a great flo . However , now i think you should change it up . You would make the greatest flo from progressive . You would rock that red lipstick . You can get a price check gun and price check the shit out of everything they order . Oh the beauty of u using ur price check gun on all the morons looking at the menu and still ask how much such and such is . So much you can do with this . Just smiling with your pretty red lips telling your crap:py customers they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be super sexy rockin flo hair . Ok that 's my vote . So much great sarcasim only you can pull of bitchy. 
@@106055168 @1455168/ <h> Me and the Old Lady Waitress <p> I am certainly not the oldest waiter in the United States , but I am the oldest one at my restaurant . My appearance may fool some into thinking that I have only worn my apron for a few years , but a closer inspection of my pores and wrinkles reveals that honey mustard runs through my veins and waiting tables has been a part of me for far too long . Recently , I saw the look of shock on the face of a co-worker when I mentioned what year I graduated from high school . It was that realization that I was older than his dad and now he felt inclined to call me " sir " and he no longer wanted to talk to me . It hurt me real bad and had my feelings not been numbed by Chardonnay , - I may have produced an actual tear . Imagine my joy when I heard that we had hired a new server who the bartender had described as a " nice older lady . " Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady with grey hair in a bun coming in through the front door using her walker . She has her spectacles hanging on a chain around her neck and she has to ask me every three minutes how to ring in a burger using the fancy computer machine . Her Life Alert bracelet is her only jewelry other than a brooch that she uses to hold her shawl around her shoulders . She has ten cats and feeds them caramel squares that she unwraps during movies . She does n't  have a cell phone because they seem like a fad and she still remembers what it was like to wait tables during the Great Depression . She has had two hip replacements and one artificial knee surgery . She steals sugar packets from the caddy before filling them up and she always microwaves the coffee for her guests because she knows what its like to have coffee in a restaurant that 's not hot enough . Her hosiery goes only as high as her knees and they support her calves in order to keep her varicose veins in check . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it can go while at the restaurant so that she can hear the orders and she constantly tries to turn the lights brighter to make it easier to see past her cataracts . She has an AARP card . <p> She is scheduled to come in at 7:00 to finish the shift with me . At 6:55 I look up to see a woman coming in to the restaurant . I immediately dismiss her as my new co-worker because she has neither a cane nor a hunch back from a lack of calcium . She is attractive with a pretty smile and her dark blond hair pulled back in a loose pony-tail . <p> " Hello , table for one ? " I ask . <p> " Oh , no I work here . My names Dawn and I 'm supposed to start at 7:00 tonight . I 'm a little early . " <p> She smiles revealing pretty straight teeth and not the dentures that I expect . <p> " Oh , you 're Dawn ? I heard about you . Welcome . " I force a smile . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger than me . Why was she described as a " nice older lady " if she is younger than me ? How the hell does the bartender describe me to people ? " Oh , him ? Yeah , he s this old man who has been waiting tables since dinosaurs were on the menu . He seems young but only because he wears clothes from American Eagle Outfitter and has big hair . If you look closer , you can kinda see that the whites of his eyes are not that white and if you stand near enough you can smell the senior citizen on him . You can tell that he shaves the hair that grows out of his ears because there 's stubble on them and he s always referring to TV shows that I have never even heard of like Good Times . He thinks he s young , but he s not . Its sad , really . Really sad . " <p> The rest of the night goes by with me making small talk to the new girl . Inside , I am crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restaurant . I am even older than the owner . I console myself with a glass of wine but consider switching over to a sherry because it seems like something old people would drink . I punch out and shuffle out the door , head low and mood lower . I am still the oldest . <p> I get home and smother my face in wrinkle cream and dye my roots . I curl up on the sofa with a good Agatha Christie book and watch a rerun of Murder , She Wrote . The afghan I knitted in my sewing circle keeps my feet warm ( for my circulation is poor ) and I try to stay awake to watch the news at 11:00 . I have a snack of buttermilk and cornbread and finally go to bed at 11:15 and dream about The Golden Girls . 109838 @qwx969838 <h> 23 thoughts on " Me and the Old Lady Waitress " <p> Okay , I used this hilarious post as a checklist so I will know if I am old or even considered old .

@@106055169 @1455169/ <h> Is This the Worst Thing To Ever Happen at Applebees ? <p> In my continuing quest to troll the Facebook pages of major chain restaurants in search of nuggets to write about , today I was on the Applebee 's page where I struck gold . Please observe this Facebook post about a man who wants to hook his friends up with an Applebee 's wedding . <p> Through my ever-intensive sleuthing , I was able to find the wedding announcement of this lucky couple and I would like to present it to you below : <p> Jim and Mary Love Each Other But They Might Love Applebees More <p> Jim Smith is proud to announce the gathering of two wonderful people who share a love for each other as well as a love for chain restaurants . Bob and Mary were just two lonely adults until they came together as one over a plate of double-glazed baby back ribs at their local Applebee 's . ( The one on Highway 5 , not the one at the mall , because everybody knows that only skanks and hos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you join Bob and Mary as they become one and promise to love , honor , obey and always order off the 2 for $20 menu until death do them part ? Their love is sweeter than an Apple Chimicheesecake and their passion burns hotter than a Sizzling Double Barrel Whiskey Sirloin . <p> It seems like it was just a few short days ago that Bob and Mary first met online in the " I G Applebee 's Google Group " and decided to take the plunge of actually meeting face to face . Actually , it was just a few short days ago . Although they were a little bit nervous about talking instead of typing , as soon as their server Odetta showed up to their table and told them she would be taking care of them that night , things fell into place . They began with an order of Green Bean Crispers and their hearts inched closer to one another when they realized they both wanted to skip the zesty horseradish sauce and get an extra creamy BBQ ranch dipping sauce instead . Even Odetta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Bob and Mary had licked the ramekin clean , they knew they were meant to be together . They were so head over heels in love that they ordered another starter and shared the Queso Blanco , feeding each other the creamy blend of cheese , cilantro and roasted poblanos . By the time they split a plate of ribs , they were engaged . <p> Please join them on Saturday February 14th , 2015 at 8:00 PM at the Applebee 's on Highway 5 for the grandest and most exquisite wedding ceremony ever known to mankind . Bob and Mary have decided to marry on Valentine 's Day because it 's the most romantic day of the year . Plus , it falls on a Saturday and we know how much fun it is to be in an Applebee 's on a Saturday night . They have made a reservation for 125 people and are requesting a booth near the window . Worst case scenario , they will have to push some tables together . The ceremony will begin promptly at 8:00 and the reception will immediately follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , do not worry about it . They will just hold your spot at the table and tell Odetta that you are on your way . If you decide to not join this special event , do n't bother letting anyone know . Odetta wo n't mind if there is a reservation for 125 and the only people who show up are Bob , Mary , their parents ( depending on the parole boards ) and Jim . The wedding party will be providing five or six appetizers ( mozzarella sticks , steak quesadilla towers , sliders , etc ) , but any extra food or alcoholic beverage will be the responsibility of the guests . Separate checks . <p> Presiding over the ceremony will be Bernie Fishass , the general manager of the Applebee 's Highway 5 , who was recently ordained online . Best man will be Jim while Odetta will be serving as the maid of honor , head waitress and busser . Mary will be upholding the tradition of incorporating something old , something new , something borrowed and something blue into the ceremony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they met , will be serving as the something old , something borrowed and something blue . For the something new , Bernie is going to open a new can of queso . <p> The bride will be wearing a gown that she designed herself modeled after the iconic Applebee 's uniform and she will be holding a bouquet of apples . The groom will be wearing an apron . Following the reception , the newlyweds plan to honeymoon at the Outback Steakhouse on the other side of town because they both dream of someday visiting Australia , but for now , Outback will have to do , mate . <p> Lmao ! As a former applebees crew member for over 7 years , this made me giggle ! Absolutely hysterical ! Love the menu referencesbut fyi , the queso does not come in a can . But who cares , that really just made my day ! I think i might share this with my former applebuddies to get their take on it.and btw , if this ever happened at my store , i might just shoot myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain restaurant , nor would I think one would allow it , would they ? I guess if it was a simple party natch of 20 or soeveryones worst nightmare but I would n't think 125 or there abouts would work . <p> Although I would love to be a fly on the wall if a real conversation ever occurs regarding this particular reception . Applebees ha . <p> OMG XD This is great ! Having worked for Applebees for about a year and a half I 've witnessed my share of strange situations , but if this ever happened in reality my faith in humanity would forever be demolished ! Its funny cause a few months back a man actually PROPOSED to a woman at my Applebees . It was an embarrassment to the human race , but hey she said , " YES " . So who am I to judge ? lmao ! ! ! <p> As a current Applebees employee , This made me lol ! ! However I would n't be surprised if this Happened Only I imagine here in our ultra classy town , That this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on Tuesdays kids meals are 99 cents and Appetizers go half off at 9. but we would get no call ahead , or warning lol <p> I held my reception at an applebees .. what 's so wrong with it ? I called and gave a final head count so they would n't have to hold extra seats . My husband and I did n't  come from a courthouse we had an actual wedding . We simply wanted a quick meal before our evening . I even arranged my wedding time so that we would be at the restaurant during a slow break . Each of our 2 waiters were given $50 to start plus tips . I even tipped despite the manager taking care of my bill .. which I know many would n't have .. that was an additional $20 each just from us . By the end each server had over $100 for serving 12 people for just over an hour . SoI think some of the rude comments about the type of people who have a reception at a chain restaurant to be absurd . Maybe some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn sure know how to be respectful to the business and the employees ! <p> The couple and the guy who posted on Applebees FB page are pals of mine . It was a joke . The couple had champagne tastes but a beer budget for their wedding , so it became a running joke in our circle of friends that the reception would have to be at Applebees . In the end , they decided to schedule their summertime wedding for the same day when their block would be closed for a neighborhood block party anyway : they held the ceremony on the front porch of the house where theyd met , and partied with friends and neighbors in the street until the wee hours . <p> Then a few months later another couple treated them to dinner and a show in NYC as a belated wedding gift . Though they went to an upscale restaurant for the actual meal , they did a FB check-in from an Applebees in Times Square .

She is the brilliant and perfectly bitchy , but in a nice way , Florence Jean Castlebury . Better known as Flo , she worked at Mels Diner on the hit television sitcom Alice . It ran from 1976 to 1985 and I watched that shit every week . Yes , I was alive to watch it . I am an old bitchy waiter . Flo was trashy , funny , slutty , easy , bitchy , and tacky . In other words , my hero . She was n't afraid to tell her boss to fuck off , but because she was on television she had to settle for " kiss my grits . " If someone told her that the food sucked she agreed with them and I never once saw her do an ounce of sidework . <p> I loved her so much I went as her for Halloween a few years ago . When it comes to a Halloween costume , I do n't  fuck around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , I was working for a mammoth hotel industry with very strict rules about what to wear and how to behave . I wont say which one in order to protect their vision of how an employee of theirs should behave while working for them and afterwards . It was Marriott . I asked them one October if we would be allowed to dress up for Halloween . They foolishly said yes . They probably thought I would wear a silly hat or put some stupid ass ears on my head . No no , uh uh . I dragged my ass up to work an hour early and went full drag . Bra , panties , slip , wig , earrings , make up , the works . I sashayed into the dining room and their jaws dropped . I was Flo . I spent the whole day in character . My tables did n't  know what to do with me . We served a lot of attorneys and judges and businessmen and they could not handle me . I called them " sugar " and " sweetie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . They were filled with discomfort that there was a man dressed up like a lady and he was flirting with them . The next year , we were not allowed to wear a costume . But that year I had a blast . And I won the costume contest too . Best tip of the day . <p> The flight from New York to Los Angeles is a long one even under the best of circumstances . Normally , I am one of the few people who can actually enjoy their time on an airplane . I find the time to be completely devoid of responsibility . Its six hours where you are free to waste your time sleeping and watching bad movies . When you factor in that I was on the flight because someone else was paying for it so I could go on national television and talk about being The Bitchy Waiter , youd think I was in Heaven at 34,000 feet . Not this flight . <p> The flight was a full one with not open free seat . Since I did n't  buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment , I ended up smack dab in the middle of the plane . No window or aisle seat for me , thanks . Two rows in front of me was a baby who wanted his presence known . This adorable crotch dumpling ( thank you for the word , reader ) cried for half of the flight . It was not a little whimper and sniff kind of cry . It sounded like there was a circumcision happening in aisle 33 seat B. I kept wondering when I would see a doctor throw the foreskin into the bag of trash that the flight attendant had as she walked down the aisle . I looked at the plastic bag my American Airlines blanket had been in and wondered if the baby would like to play with it despite the warning on it that said " this bag is not a toy . " <p> To the left of me was a man I envied because he told me was taking an Ambien and a muscle relaxer . He did just that . Then he put in earphones and blew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the entire flight . I considered asking for an Ambien but the only thing I had to barter with was a granola bar and half empty bottle of water . Thankfully , he did n't  snore and had he left his bag within easy access , I would have pilfered through it trying to find some peace and quiet in the form of a pill .. <p> To the right of me was a very large man who looked like he had just come from doing extra work on Yentl . Oy . He poured himself into his seat and his odor drifted into my seat along with a portion of his extra body mass . You know what your gym shorts smell like after you do cardio and you maybe had just had a bowel movement where some baby wipes would have been helpful but you did n't  have any so you settle for " clean enough " but who cares since you 're going to the gym anyway ? I wish he smelled that good . Something about layers and layers of black wool being worn on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed . Add to that a big gray beard that goes to your chest and holds onto sweat the way I hold onto a margarita glass and you have a really miserable seat mate . And why does he not realize that the arm rest is for both of us to share ? Of course he fell asleep almost instantly after having three phone conversations as we taxied down the runway . When he got up once to go the bathroom he returned with whatever stench had been living in the toilet . He fell asleep again but this time he made sure to face me so his foul breath could come in my direction as he snored . I was holding on to a fart for about two hours but eventually let it go in a futile attempt to freshen the air . <p> When I finally landed in The City of Angels , my driver was waiting to take me to my hotel . I checked in at midnight and ignored the idea of beauty sleep and called a friend to come get me . We ate at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Flo , how could I not ? We spent the late hours walking down the Hollywood Walk of Fame looking for the stars of Florence Henderson , Polly Holiday and Shirley Hemphill . When I found Ann B. Davis star , I knew I had made it . I was in Hollywood ! Dr. Phil was waiting for me , so I forced myself to get some sleep in preparation for the next day where I would go on national television and proclaim my hatred of children in my station . So what , I only had three hours of sleep ? Surely , Dr. Phils people would have some concealer to cover the bags under my eyes . <p> I am dedicating this post to my favorite television waitress of all time .

And I won the costume contest too . Best tip of the day . <p> Summer is upon us and the humidity level is creeping higher and higher . Here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . Having lived here for 16 years I am still not used to the fact that in the winter it can be 5- and then in the summer it can be 95- . What the hell kind of place is this ? And I do n't  care what people say about it not being the heat but the humidity . If its 95- its fucking hot no matter what the humidity level is . The reason I 'm so flumfluxxed about the temperature is because I have to wear a uniform to work and that uniform is black pants and a long sleeve black button up shirt . You try wearing that and walking into the depths of holy hell that we call the subway and try to stay fresh for more than three minutes . Its impossible . When I get off the train and get to work , its not pretty sometimes . Sure , I could carry my uniform to work in a garment bag , but really ? A garment bag that carries a stain covered pair of pants and a faded dress shirt ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry it in a bag , but really ? And then get to work and have to wear a stain covered pair of pants and a faded dress shirt that is also wrinkled ? A true dilemma . So what do I do ? I wear it and and turn into a big hot sweaty mess and then serve my guests looking like a tired dried up French whore who just gave a blow job in a sauna . <p> At my last job , I could wear whatever I wanted which was a good thing for about two weeks . And then I realized I was getting all my real clothes stained with coffee and grease and I started longing for a uniform again . I do n't  know who came up with the universal uniform for restaurant folks to be khakis , but that 's what it is most of the time . Pizzeria Uno , Bennigans , Houlihans and Black Eyed Pea were all khakis . I have spent about 13 years of my life being forced to wear Dockers and Gap pants . <p> My big issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear a certain article of clothing but they make us pay for it . That pisses my shit off . If I have to wear that ugly ass burgundy shirt , Mr. Houlihans , I do n't  want to pay for it . Same thing with you , Mr. Black Eyed Pea . I have to buy the green shirt with the stupid ass embroidered logo ? Or sometimes they will give you one shirt but if you want another it comes out of your paycheck . Fuck that . I will take the one free shirt and wear that bitch every day until it has so much food on it that it walk itself into the restaurant and start picking up shifts . <p> If I have to wear a uniform , I want to wear one that has some personality . I want a little hat and an cute frilly apron and a name tag . I want a big starched white collar and white sneakers . I want bright red lipstick and a beehive . Basically , I wan na be Flo from the television show Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even been her for Halloween . Now that 's a uniform . <p> And does anyone get what the post title is referring to ? Does anyone still weara hat ? 109837 @qwx969837

As I started tolight the candles and get the ice out , my co-worker told me that the original Mrs. Lovett/Mame/Jessica Fletcher/Bedknob and Broomsticker , Angela Lansbury was coming in . Ah , a customer ! My immediate response was to get some flowers , maybe daisies to brighten up the room . Do n't  you think some flowers , pretty daisies , might relive the gloom ? But then I decided that we would just lower the lights so that the candle wax on the carpet was n't so easily seen . I simply could not believe that someone of that stature would be breathing the same air as I do . Now ordinarily , I do n't  give a flip about celebrities ( case in point , here ) , but this lady is kinda amazing . She has been on Broadway fourteen times , has five Tony Awards- , three Oscar nominations , eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that . Tale as old as time , song as old as rhyme , that is some major shit . As we got ready for the shift , we could n't help but wonder which station she would be in . We were both a little scared , neither one prepared , but we were going to do our best to serve this elegant grand dame of a lady . We could pool our resources , by joining forces but it was going to end up that only one if us would get to be her server . <p> At last the moment arrived . I was standing at table 19 taking the order for six gay guys when they all simultaneously had the wind knocked out of them when Angela floated by on a cloud made of holiness , graciousness and Actors Equity cards . A hush fell over the crowd as they tried to comprehend what amazingness they were witnessing . I see crowds , I hear yells , there 's a parade in town . The room broke out into applause and Ms. Lansbury simply smiled and bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say save it for the performer they came to see . Cool lady , that Angela . She did not sit in my station which was probably for the best . The last time I served a big time Tony Award- winner , my hand shook as I handed the non-alcoholic martini to Joanna Gleason . Besides , I could potentially obsess on Angela and end up telling her " try and you 're gon na see how you 're gon na not at all get away from me . " <p> After the show was over she was one of the first people out . Wait , what 's your rush , what 's your hurry ? Did she need a stronger hand ? Did I give enough , did I give too much ? But before I knew it , she was gone . Like a vision . All that was left was her empty Pelligrino bottle . I have it now . At last , my right arm is complete again . 109837 @qwx969837

@@106055192 @1455192/ <h> How To Enjoy Being in a Party of 25 <p> Having been a waiter since the dawn of time , it is very difficult for me to go into a restaurant and completely enjoy myself . Too often , I am watching to see how the restaurant is being run or trying too hard to accommodate my server and make thinks easier for him . When I go out in a large group , its even worse . I get a serious case of angina because I know how difficult large parties can be for a server . Not all large parties , just some . I have been chastised on this blog before for writing rules for customers so they can make it easier for their server . Today , however , I am going to write some rules for customers that will make it easier on themselves . Specifically , when you go out to dinner as part of a large group . <p> We 've all been there . Its your friends cousins boyfriends birthday and you suddenly find yourself at a restaurant in a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you are sitting between a lady you have never seen before and another lady you never want to see again . The one person you know is sitting at the other end of the table and you hear the waitress say , " Sorry , we do n't  do separate checks . " You are overcome with panic and fear , sweat dripping off your nose , as you begin to wonder how in the hell you are going to deal with the check when it makes it to the table . If its like every other time you have been in this situation , the last person to hold the check is going to get screwed and you do n't  want to have to pay extra because someone else does n't  know how to divvy up a check . Relax . I 've got you covered . Keep these things in mind the next time you are going to be at a restaurant in a- large group . <p> Bring cash . Specifically , bring a few twenties , a ten , a five and four singles . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from anyone and you wont have to use a credit card . I know , I know , you do n't  ever have any cash , but trust me . Stop your lazy ass at the ATM and do it . You will not regret it . <p> Keep track of what you are ordering as you order it . Look at the prices on the menu so you do n't  have to look at the bill later and search to see how much your nachos cost . Keep a rolling total in your head as you go so that you will know exactly how much you owe . <p> Keep track of what those around you order too . If you notice that the booze hound on the other end of the table is ordering three martinis for your every one beer you want to be able to stop the presses when he says , " Hey , let 's just divide this check by twenty-five . " ( Be aware , if the booze hound has crazy fucked up hair and is desperate for attention , you may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that drunk bitch that you only had two beers and a burger while he had five martinis , a salad , a steak and dessert . You 'll pay for what you had , thank you very much . <p> Be sure to add the tax and tip , assuming you live in a state that has sales tax . The average sales tax in the United States is 9.6% . A good tip is 20% . Round it up to 30% and call it a day . If your food and beverage total was $29 , just add 30% to that total , which would be $37.70 . Since you have cash , all you have to do is lay down a twenty , a ten , a five and three singles . Always round up because you know some ass hole is going to be cheap . If the gratuity is added , it will probably be around 15-20% , so you will be covered . <p> Be one of the first people to put your money down . Be clear . Say , " I had two beers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am leaving $38.00 . " Drop that money onto the table and wash your hands of the situation . By being the first one to put money down , you are doing two things ; you are providing some change there for other people to use because some bitch only has a hundred dollar bill and you are ensuring that you will not be the last person who handles the bill and realizes that the table is still forty dollars short . <p> Be strong . No matter how hard you may want to help those clueless bitches with the check , do n't  do it . Stay out of it . You have contributed the correct amount and you are no longer responsible . <p> If you are not eating , you can always sneak away to the bar and get your drinks from the bartender so you can pay as you go . This will keep you from having to even look at the bill when the time comes . The server probably wo n't give a shit since there will be twenty-four other needy assholes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm all good . " <p> If you 're like me , you 'll want to leave as soon as possible . Once you know that your part of the bill is completed , feel free to say your good byes and move on . It always gets dicey at the end when everyone is forced to throw in a few extra dollars to make up for the losers . I used to stay until the bitter end and always pony up extra money but not any more . I have learned that it is not worth it . <p> Lastly , call your friend who invited you to this shit birthday party and tell them it sucked . Tell them you do n't  give a rats ass about their cousins boyfriends birthday and then find out why that bitch did n't  even sit next to you . You were stuck between two whores who thought TGIFridays was some fine dining shit and you did not appreciate it . Tell this friend that the next time you end up in a party of twenty-five , it better be a party where someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe if you keep these rules handy , you will not totally hate the next time you are in this situation , or at least you wo n't hate the paying of the check . You will still hate that a booze hound with crazy fucked up hair is sucking all the attention out of the room but please give him a break . He s not that bad . He s insecure and if you pay close attention , he is taking notes for a future blog post . 109836 @qwx969836 <h> 21 thoughts on " How To Enjoy Being in a Party of 25 " <p> Nicely put . The one thing I would do differently is give my share of the tip directly to the server , along with my sincere thanks for putting up with a party of two dozen schmucks and me . Everything else you wrote is spot on . <p> I cant pay cash when everyone else has a card , unless the server knows what I had and applies MY cash to MY stuff . Otherwise , they take the cash off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tipping off the total . <p> As a server , I 'm fine with divvying up a check as long as everyone stayed in the fucking seats they started in so I remember what they had . It also helps if everyone pays with a card . Its way easier than having to make change for 15 twenty-dollar-bills . If you pay cash , just leave enough to take care of the bill plus tip and tell the server you do n't  need change . <p> Another thing I feel like people do n't  realize : a 20% tip is so easy to figure out in your head . Why complicate things by trying to figure out what 17.5% of $38.94 is ? Just leave 20% and stop trying to find a way to justify it . <p> Ha , these remind me of the times when people at my university would have to organise society socials . The worst ones were when I 'd have to go with about 25-30 people whom I all knew , but did n't  really want to get well-acquainted with . Theyd all be cliquey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of table banter , and there were a few complete ditzy ones whod just put in a tenner and a bit of change and then bugger off . Luckily , no more ! = <p> The only one I disagree with is going to the bar . I 'm serving your party to serve it , not for you to go to the bar all that does is keep my sales down and I make less money . It also makes you look like an impatient jerk . <p> If I 'm in a big party , I 'll do the finger crooking gesture to the server ( Yes , Bitchy I know you hate this but its for a good reason ) , before the drink order is even placed . <p> Ill often whisper to the server , please add 25% to EVERYONEs check ( or THE check ) . When the bill arrives , I simply tell everyone at the table " I asked the server to add 25% to our/your bill . Just pay the amount owed at the bottom . " <p> The table will hate me ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the server will love me . <p> This would be great advice except for the asshole that DOES pay with a card and now that 20 percent tip you dropped and walked away from got put towards the bill . Rest of the card , 70 dollar tap down to 16 bucks and the server walks away with 2 . Happened to me last night . When I put down the check I clearly state CASH AMOUNT WENT TOWARDS THE BILL leaving whatever for the card . Sometimes it works , most the time people selectively listen . <p> That happens to me on nearly a daily basis . I work at a restaurant that specializes in chocolate , desserts and fondue so we get large parties every single day/night . Mostly for birthdays . And they always pull the whole , " We want to put $25 on the card and the rest in cash " then we end up getting tipped in the amount on the card . Not to mention , its a tourist trap on a busy street in Boston so the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What really chaps my ass is the " take the cash off , then put the rest on the card " bullshit . So , after a dozen instances where the card-payer basically stole my tip to subsidize their payment , then only tipped on the card amount , I altered my tactic . When gathering the cash/card , I say with a dazzling smile ( directly to the cash-payer ) " and does the cash included tip , or should it all be applied to the bill ? " Inevitably , I get a " I never thought about that ! " look . ( Along with an " eat shit " glare from the card-payer , who was looking forward to applying their friends eight bucks to their bill . ) I encourage split checks , I bring split checks to the table , and if its all together , fine , I 'll adjust it . But it is too much to expect adults to do basic arithmetic such as correctly adding the tip to the total , I am not going to trust them to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculations for them and print " suggested gratuity " at the bottom of every check , a correct calculation of 15 and 20% . <p> Ugh I hate these situations . I was at one of these dinners for a good friends birthday and 2 of her friends fucked off after only paying for their food and not the 2 beers they had each . Gah ! I of course ended up paying more because I obviously did n't  want it to ruin my friends evening . Never . Again . <p> For my last birthday , my husband threw me a surprise party at our local pub/restaurant with 28 guests at one long table . After 20 years together , he is very clear on my feelings and protocol regarding large parties at restaurants . I usually hate them , because I get stuck next to Uncle Myron who never stops talking about taxidermy and/or Perky Friend hands me the check at the end to figure out who should pay what which usually means I pay more because I would rather eat glass than scrimp on a large party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had prepped each guest that I would be moving around the table so I could talk to everyone , so they should be ready to " musical chair " it . Hed put in an order of appetizers , so there would n't be an hour of people figuring out the menu . Hed identified the " check team " who would be responsible for organizing the check and payment . And he assured me that he was extra tipping the wait staff himself . <p> I hate going to restaurants in a large party specifically for this reason . There is ALWAYS that one idiot that does n't  put enough money for their bill . I add up the money I owe and tell the waitress how much to charge my credit card . Ive paid for peoples food way too many times . <p> The last group free-for-all I went to was when I argued with someone that they owed more than the $10.99 than their entree costs , after he took out a dollar so he could round down for his penny ( he put in $11.00 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he took back $1 ! ! ! ) . I mentioned tax , his drinks and tip . He actually argued that he thought that tax was a stupid and should n't be charged anyway , the person who invited everyone should pay the bar bill and that there were plenty of other people to cover the tip . Nobody else would speak up . <p> I no longer go out in large groups unless its prepaid ( and I 've arranged it so I know that the waiter is n't getting stiffed ) , or I 'm footing the bill . <p> I think this few general things , The site style is wonderful , the articles is really excellent : D. Good job , cheers 
@@106055194 @1455194/ <p> I was so very impressed when I went to your table and saw a big fancy one-hundred dollar bill laying next to your check . My first thoughts were , " Wow , he must be really rich and powerful in order to have hundred dollar bills in his wallet . I am envious of someone like him , gee willikers . " It must have been really cool to see you reach into your wallet and toss that money onto the table and then waltz out of the restaurant . Everyone sitting with and around you must have been pretty impressed . I mean , a hundred dollar bill ? ? Wow ! But here 's the deal . Your check totaled $117.32 . You know what that means , right ? Yeah , you walked out on your check , you big pile of stinky dog shit . So not only did you not leave me a tip , you think I will just cover that extra $17.32 , is that it ? You sir , are a gentleman and an asshole . <p> Just so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , the government is going to assume that I got tipped 8% of your check , or in other words , $9.39 . So I will be taxed and social securitied and FICAd about $2.35 . But here 's the deal : you did n't  tip me . I cant call up Uncle Sam and say , " Oh yeah , the asshole at table 201 did n't  actually tip me so just disregard that bill , thanks . " Nope . I will pay that $2.35 regardless . So not only did I not make any money from your table , I lost money by serving you.In some restaurants , I would be expected to tip the busser or food runner based on my sales . So if I had to tip them 2% of whatever I sold , I would be expected to give them $2.34 even though you did n't  tip me jack shit . Are you starting to see how crappy it was of you to walk out on your check like you did ? <p> In some places , the managers will make waiters pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really sucks . That 's when waiters have to get creative and start moving things around from one check to another just to cover that loss . Ethical , no . Necessary , yes . Lucky for me I was working at a place where my managers know that people like you exist and my manager voided off some items from your check so it would be under $100.00 . That is n't always the case though . <p> Yes , I tried to find you . I ran out onto the street to see if I could spot your weasel ass slinking away but you had already crawled back into your hole and vanished . I just wanted to let you know that you really suck . You cant pull that shit in Macys or at Target , but in a restaurant , I guess you can . I know now why you did n't  want to leave a phone number or contact email with the host when you first checked in . We tell you that we like to get your info in case we find an iPhone or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can call your cheap , no-good , thieving ass and tell you that you need to drag your sorry skank self back up to the restaurant and finish paying your check .

I hope you get a severe case of cold sore and pink eye coupled with some major chapped lips and a skin rash . I want your face to be as unattractive as your behavior . Fuck you . <p> Love , The Bitchy Waiter <p> I hope you will share this so people will know what happens when they do n't  pay their check . 109839 @qwx969839 <h> Now read one of these lame-ass posts : <p> LONG ... Tip or Not To LONG ... LONG ... 27 Feb 2010 17:33:00 LONG ... national debate is rearing its ugly head amongst us and I must confront it . It seems that some people need to know if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server . And my answer may come as quite a shock to some of you , but I say : yes . On the rare occasion , it is okay to stiff a server . A reader named Dee writes : <p> Only once was it so bad that I decided a tip wasnt deserved . When the waitperson came to pick up the signed credit card receipt , I took the opportunity to tell him that there was no tip included for his service . I told him that since he waited until clearing from the appetizer to tell me that theyd run out of Prime Rib , that I never received the hot tea I 'd ordered , that I got baked potato as a side when I 'd ordered rice pilaf , and that my dining partners entree arrived 15 minutes before my second choice was served for all those reasons , I told him I did n't  feel he deserved a tip . <p> I think Dee was right to refuse a tip and she was also right in explaining to the server why he was n't getting one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , things slip our mind and we can fuck up . And sometimes at work you can have only four mistakes happen all week but all four of them happen to be at the same table . Its like the perfect storm of bad service . Maybe the kitchen did n't  tell him they were out of Prime Rib until it was too late . Shitty , yes . But maybe he should have accepted the blame and try to make up for it by bringing another app that was comped while she waited . He certainly should not have brought out her friends food when her order was n't ready to come out with it . That was dumb . And maybe the kitchen sent out the wrong side , but if a table has already been slighted , its the servers responsibility to make sure everything else is right . I would have been hovering in that kitchen to ensure that it came out quickly and correctly . I have found too that it helps if you just are completely honest to a table when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sorry . What can I do to make it better ? Customers like it when we accept responsibility for mistakes . They hate it when you blame the kitchen or the the runner or the host or whoever the fuck . They are n't  dealing with any of them , they are dealing with the waiter , so therefore everything is the responsibility of the waiter . Period . <p> Of course , I think its better to leave at least 10% so that there is enough to cover the taxes and tipping out . And if you are really unhappy with the service and you feel it was the waiters fault , let a manager know or just do n't  go back . I stiffed someone once . It was at The Black Eyed Pea in Houston . The waiter was an idiot and kept fucking up our order . And then at the end when we mentioned something about going back home , he said , " oh to your trailer park ? " What the fuck ? Did he just call me trailer trash ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mobile home ( trailers are for horses and mobile homes are for people , just so you know ) but he can not insult me like that . He should have had the decency to go to the sidestand and then do it like all self-respecting waiters . That was the final nail in his coffin and I picked up his 20% and put it right back in my pocket . <p> Yes , Dee , it is okay . Choosing to leave no tip is alright if there is justification . We know when we are doing a shitty job and sometimes it just happens . When it happens to me , I am not surprised with a stiff . What we do n't  like is when we know we gave great service and do n't  a tip . Or when we realize we fucked up , we tried to fix the problem and they say they are satisfied and then they still do n't  tip . Fear not , sweet , Dee . You were okay in your actions . We love that you tip above 18% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 
@@106055198 @1455198/ <h> Dear Abby versus Dear Bitchy Waiter <p> Thank you to everyone who alerted me to this Dear Abby column that happened over the weekend : <p> DEAR ABBY : My co-workers and I recently went out to eat and I was put in an awkward situation . One of them announced that I had left a big tip when I paid my bill . Abby , I always leave a generous tip . I was raised well below the poverty line , and my mothers tips literally determined how much we would be able to eat that day . The co-worker who said it became upset with me and began lecturing me about how " rude " it is to leave a large tip , especially when you 're with other people . She even said it " degrades " the server . <p> My mom may have raised me differently than most people , but I was taught that its OK to leave a big tip as long as you do n't  announce it to everyone . Was what I did considered rude ? GENEROUS IN CONNECTICUT <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was your co-worker , for making a spectacle . She probably did it because your tip made hers appear to be stingy . Diners leave tips based upon the quality of the service they receive . If you felt your server merited it , you were right to leave a large tip . <p> P.S. I have never heard of a server feeling " degraded " because of a large tip . Grateful , yes . Degraded , never ! <p> Of course the response was sweetly written by Dear Abby , but I have my own response that I think is just a little bit better and more to the point : <p> DEAR GENEROUS : God bless your little pea-picking heart for knowing that servers depend on tips . Your mother must have been a very wise woman and she raised a magnificent child in you . As for your co-worker , she is a tired dried up piece of shit for brains bitch who was totally embarrassed that you made her look like the cheap nasty whore that she is . Maybe she should tie an apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what its like when someone leaves her a crap tip . Severs do not feel degraded by big tips . Maybe she thinks that it looks like pity or a hand-out when really it is just a customers way to say " job well done . " You want to know when servers feel degraded ? They feel degraded when customers bark orders at them without ever saying " please " or " thank you . " They feel degraded when they are left a few coins on the table after they have busted their hump to make sure that the meal was everything the customer wanted it to be . They feel degraded when asked " so what 's your real job " or " what 's your back-up plan for your future ? " <p> Leaving a big tip is not rude . Rude is ignoring the server who is trying to set the entree down while the customer is busy taking a fucking picture of his cocktail to send to his Facebook page . Rude is when a customer let 's their child run freely around the whole restaurant bothering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying around big heavy steaming plates of food . Rude is when a customer stays at their table an hour after paying the check making it impossible to turn the table so that the server can actually make money while at work . Leaving a big tip is the opposite of rude . <p> Generous , you were right in what you did . I hope you left the tip that you wanted to leave and did not let that cheap bitch interfere with your good intentions . As for your friend , I suggest you cut her loose from your life . If she 's just a co-worker , then leave it at that . She is not someone you want to have anything to do with . Nobody likes her and you were probably the last person who could still stand being around her which is another credit to your mother who obviously taught you to respect other people . This person does not deserve respect . All she deserves is a punch in the cunt and a big bag of bed bugs . <p> Love , <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thoughtful response , I should totally have my own syndicated advice column in a magazine . I am so fucking helpful and shit . If you agree , please " like " this and let 's make it happen . <h> 16 thoughts on " Dear Abby versus Dear Bitchy Waiter " <p> how can you be rude when you are presenting something to someone who deserves it ? If someone is serving you properly and you gave a nice tip then I can not see why that stupid s**t headed co-worker FELT that way . What if she works her a** off and her employer pays only 10% just in case that she feels you know .. ' DEGRADED ' <p> " All she deserves is a punch in the cunt and a big bag of bed bugs .

You also had the opportunity to mention the name of your blog.The blog sounded interesting so I made a decision to check it out and found that you use abusive and vulgar language to get you point across.Just so you will know , I usually tip 20% of my bill when I eat out and even more if the service was exceptional.When I go to a restaurant that has a buffet , I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the servers . I understand that they depend on the tips to make a living.But you , sir , have an attitude that you need to change.To be honest with you , I would n't want to go to a restaurant where you were the server.It seems you are already looking for bad customers before they even sit down . <p> Do n't  feel too bad . All I know is English so I am impressed by anyone who learns a second language and from what I have heard English is one of the harder languages for a non-native speaker to pick up . <p> Really , anonymous ? Servers only deserve good tips if they do n't drop F bombs ? You 're worse than the people who say servers should " just get another job " and have no right to complain , because apparently in your world they 're only allowed to complain if they do n't use language that makes you uncomfortable.And if you think for a second that the writer literally and truly wants to punch that woman in the cunt and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the blog altogether . <p> When I was a waitress , I never felt degraded because they gave a large tip . That just made me provide top service for them when they returned . I have had customers tip me in change because they thought it was a joke . If you ca n't afford the tip then just do n't tip , do n't be rude.And for all those complaining about what he writes about . Get your life . Let 's be honest . People are rude to waiters and feel that they can take out all their anger out on them . Even on things they obviously can not control . There is nothing like trying to provide all this great service to people for them to treat you like shit during the whole meal or at the end of the meal . I have been there it sucks . <p> I do n't really know the behavior of that particular woman , but these rude people who ignore the server who 's trying to give them their food , letting their kids run everywhere etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why are they even IN the restaurant ORDERING food if they do n't want to eat it . If they 're just there for a nice ooh lalala pretty little cocktail to photograph and put on Facebook , then why do n't they just get the dam cocktail and photograph it and drink it and PAY and leave a nice TIP and call a taxi because the few brain cells they have left wo n't belong anywhere NEAR the wheel ? ? ?

Everyone who has a job has a horror story and if you work at Hooters , you might have a whore story as well . Someone asked me who was the most famous person I have ever served while waiting tables . After thinking about all my brushes with celebrity greatness , I decided my answer was Sally Field , leaving one Miss Katy Perry out in the cold . There were other servers in the mix and I thought that no one else could have possibly waited on someone more famous than Sally Field . But someone did . <p> " I once waited on Tina Louise , " said Joann . <p> My mind froze . As Joann told her story , I was unable to think of anything else except the deep valley of jealousy I had just fallen into .

We were caught by teachers thirty seconds into our brawl and we both ended up in the principal 's office getting three pops with a paddle .

Hand the information over to the server that was attacked , and inform him that he has every right to pursue a charge against these women , and recommend he do so . Next , when the police show , fill out a trespass warrant against these women , banning them from the property ( usually for 1 year ) .

@@106055219 @1455219/ <h> IHOPs National Pancake Day = Horrible Customers <p> Can we all just take a minute to send out some love and support to our fellow servers who were working at IHOP yesterday ? As you may know , yesterday was National Pancake Day and it 's when IHOP gives out stacks and stacks of free pancakes . In exchange for getting free pancakes , customers are asked to donate to Children 's Miracle Network or other charities associated with IHOP . The chain started this fundraising campaign in 2006 and have since raised almost $16 million . <p> Having never worked at IHOP , I can only guess , but yesterday has to be the most awful and jacked up day of the entire year to work there . I bet it 's like if you you take Mother 's Day and combine it with Easter and then cram it in between two buttermilk pancakes and smother them with blueberry compote , Karo syrup and rage . I 'm sure there plenty of wonderful customers who were happy to take advantage of the day , but reassured there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I want to focus on . <p> Those servers are busting their syrup covered asses off all day and even though the breakfast might be free , it does not mean its alright to not tip or that its okay to take advantage of the generosity of IHOP . I found two wonderful examples of some of the slime that slithered into a booth yesterday and showed their true ugly colors . <p> Offender #1 is some pseudo-bad ass on Twitter named Uncle Milton who bragged about not tipping his waiter : <p> The second offender is this low-life girl who ordered a bunch of pancakes only so she could wrap them up in a napkin and drop them into her purse . After all , " Its free , we takin it " is the matra when it comes to giving to charity , is it not ? The only thing more annoying than her behavior is the guy who is filming it and saying " naahhhh " over and over again . Seriously , shut the fuck up . We do n't  know whether or not they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the benefit of the doubt and pretend they left 20% . <p> Thank you , IHOP servers for suffering through National Pancake Day . I 'm sure lots of money was raised for charity , but I certainly hope that enough customers tipped you to make that living hell all worth it . <p> I am an IHOP server , yesterday was hell , absolute hell . Unfortunately , our customer base was made up of teenagers , elderly and many low lives . However , there were some amazing people who tipped wonderfully . No server got off on time , I literally had to run out of there and barely made it home in timr to get my child off the bus . The expo was run ragged for 1.5% of our sales , meaning they make next to nothing for busting their asses all day . All of the servers , myself included , fought the urge to say f this , I 'm out . So please , if you go into IHOP for free pancakes , tip your server . Pancake day is more chaotic than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an IHOP server and thank goodness we only have to deal with that day once a year.I know it is for a good cause.IYou people that did n't  tip their server should do our job.They would n't survive an hour.I think everyone in college should work in the restaurant industry learn what RESPECT is . <p> My heart goes out to all IHOP employees that had to work yesterday . I think I would have quit ! I cant even imagine . Makes me want to go to IHOP just give a huge tip , a big hug , be nice to them , and hopefully restore their faith in humanity ! <p> I unfortunately was among the many servers to work free pancake day at ihop yesterday . It was complete hell and its frustrating on a day like that to get stiff because you 're constantly running back and forth . Usually in the ihop restaurant I work at on a busy morning we have 4 tables a person . From 7-10:30 am before the rest of the staff arrived I had 9 tables . Definitely not an easy task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept track of the number of times I got stiffed . A solid number of 14 times . It became very discouraging . At one point I got stiffed 6 tables in a row and all I could think was great I just made about 2 bucks an hour . Teenagers are the absolute worse and honestly each time I just kept saying I hope one day they know how this feels . <p> My husband just yelled " Broad side hit well deserved ! " We are laughing like heck over both these comments and yours is especially true . Overpriced ? I can she thinks McDonalds is a bargain ? Oh waitthey do n't  take the stamps either . <p> Having worked at an IHOP myself and suffered through this last year I must say , this is the worst day to ever work . People are so inconsiderate towards us and even though this is a good cause , I wish this day would cease to exist . I pray that my old coworkers did much better this year at work tip wise . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than christmas and black friday combined . We were all ready to walk out . Our gm expod from 8 am til 1030 pm . We went through every last gallon of maple syrup we had . And almost none of my tables tipped me . With the exception of a few very generous people , who must have known our pain . They are what made this business worth it . <p> i work at ihop , I worked yesterday Had 3 people walk out , even though there bill was more than 0.00 cause of drinks and various other food they bought , and also made only 50$ in tips for working 6 hours I get more money on days that I only have 6 customers than 30 on free pancake day <p> I used to work at dennys both years they did the free grand slam day . ( Thankfully they had enough common sense to do away with it ) I 'm sure that free pancake day is just the same at IHOP . It was a nightmare . Not only was I stiffed all day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is free . All day people would order drinks or extra sides and walk out without paying for them even though I would specify that they would be responsible for the cost . Ive been there and I feel for all of you IHOP employees . I feel like you guys deserve extra vacation days if you work free pancake day <p> Kudos to the IHOP employees that had to be burdened with such hell . I cant imagine the trash this brings in . If I had to work on that day I seriously would stab myself in the eye just to not work . Thank you so much for not having to do that . You all get the bow this week I 'm so not worthy . <p> I worked this day and it would n't be as bad if more people realized that its for a great cause and more people donated instead of rude high school kids coming in , a lot tried to come in more than once hoping to get a different server , being rude and demanding and then not even leaving a donation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined by rude people taking advantage . <p> Instead of free pancakes , why would n't IHOP just state that you 'll pay for your pancakes , but 100% of what you pay for the pancakes will be donated ? And you 'll be given the opportunity to donate more if you choose ? If someone has money to support a charity , they probably wo n't give a damn about a free pancake . Its not like I 'm going to get all soft-hearted by IHOPs example of giving and turn around and give . <p> I am a server at IHOP and this is my third pancake day and by far it was the worst .. our store had a line that was almost around the building an hour before we opened .. we were supposed to close at 10pm and were still going at midnight . we ran out of straws , kids cups , butter , milk and dangerously close at the butter to .. 7 straight hours non stop a handful of my 100 tables yep 100 .. and less then 10 percent tipped the rest spent their time complaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donate . its frustrating because it is for a good reason but no way to keep it from going so completely wrong that the entire staff feels beat up and so much money is lost in walkouts that ordered from the main menu and did n't  bother to pay for their food much less why this event is held .. tired and still 4 more days to work this week .. thanks for the support everyone . <p> I used to be a server at IHOP . I have worked National Pancake day . The tips ate horrible and some of the people are rude . Teenagers are the worst they come in before school and get the free pancakes and water , never leave a tip , and if they order drinks they walk out on the bill . I taught my kids never to do that . God Bless all of you servers . I hope yall had a great day . <p> Well I absolutely hate that day . Worked it every time since it started . This year tips better than the last . We ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost out of pancake mix . People would come in the morning and back in at the night . Water and cakes . I worked my butt off from 6-11 . We stopped doing free cakes at 10 . Only raised 600$ in donation . I started telling my tables just because your bill is 0$ donf mean you do n't  not tip . I could n't say that to all because of the the of people that they were but most if my tables I told that to . One table I did tipped 50$ . I ended up making 186$ . But my thoughts are for the businesss go buy bottled water . Sell it for $1 if they want water . Then put the money from that towards the charity . <p> I know your pain . I worked at Applebees and had the pleasure of working 2 Veterans Days and every Veteran gets a free meal . You have n't seen cheap and rude people until they are getting a free meal . We had plenty of people walkout without paying for their drinks or their spouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W also had a few people come in with bogus papers claiming that they are or were in the military .

So I told him I would have to have my manager look over the papers because he did n't  have a military i 'd on him , when all day all legitimate military members , both active and retired , showed their i 'd . The longer he waited on my manager the more angry he became . He started calling me names and just acting like an all around jackass .

They are perpetually renewable , because once a military man/woman always one . <p> I am sorry that Veterans Day was so harsh . I heard the stories and it made me sad that this is what it has come to . Sometimes the spouses are the worst . Yes , they are incredibly supportive and do so much , but they are n't  the veteran . No matter what they may think . <p> To all the IHOP servers I have a question to see if this would be feasible next year . <p> My husband and I former server wondered if we would be allowed to come in , take a table , get our pancakes and paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't  care . BUT.can we tip you $100 and camp at your table for 4 hours ? In addition we will , of course , donate the same amount to CMN . <p> I do n't  know if management would allow it but we would n't need anything except our initial food cold is fine , we understand and we would give the tip up front , not for good service , damn near impossilbe on this day but so you know why we are camping . <p> I just figured if the 6 tables afters us are going to stiff you and run you ragged , and we did n't  wouldnt $25 an hour give you a bit of relief . It would be one less table to worry about . I promise . <p> Let me know . If it is possible we are doing this and recruiting friends for this too .

@@106055230 @1455230/ <h> Category Archives : National Pancake Day <p> Get out the Aunt Jemima and powdered sugar , because today is National Fucking Pancake Day , bitches . You know I am all about National Pancake Day since my whole life revolves around an icon of pancakes . And speaking of Aunt Jemima , have you noticed that she looks a lot like Oprah lately ? I guess the Mammy character seemed a bit un-PC so they Oprah-ized her . Anyhoo , IHOP created this day in 2006 so it is a tradition that is literally years in the making . Five of them . The day benefits Childrens Miracle Network Hospitals- which raises funds for 170 childrens hospitals across North America . If you go into IHOP on Tuesday , March 1 , 2011 , 7 a.m. 10 p.m. they will serve your fat ass a free short stack . In return , you are asked to make a donation . It says only one short stack per customer , but I assume that means at each location . There is no reason that you ca n't drive from IHOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many miles can one drive in a 15 hour period ? I would think you should be able to get to at least ten different IHOPS and chow down on the free pancakes . Never mind that gas is $3.50 a gallon , we are talking free fucking pancakes here , ladies . <p> Why if I had an unlimited supply of free pancakes , I could spend my day sitting on my pancake couch watching the Food Network while eating pancakes . After a carb overload , I would place my head on my pancake pillow and fall asleep dreaming of rivers of maple syrup . Floating down the syrup river would be a waffle rowboat with oars made out of sticks of butter . I would be in that boat trying to paddle , but I would end up eating my butter oars instead . As the boat drifts to the crest of a waterfall , I would jump from the boat and grab hold of a bacon tree and climb to safety as the boat slowly careened over the fall and into a pool of sticky sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have a nibble of the salty pig until I was ready to switch back to sweet fluffy pancakes . I take a bite of pancake that is served by Oprah who is dressed like Aunt Jemimah . Oprah would say to me , " Bitchy Waiter , you know putting me in this costume is verging on racial stereotypes , right ? " And I would say to her , " Yes , Oprah , I do . But this is just a pancake-induced dream so please go melt me some butter for my next batch of pancakes . And by the way , you should have won an Oscar for The Color Purple . " Oprah laughs and says , " Honey child , you know you got that right . " She goes off to melt butter , read a book and slap Gayle on the ass . Ahh , pancakes . I dream of pancakes . I can no longer tell if I am dreaming or if I am awake . The pancake feast has corroded my brain and my ears are filled with sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good . <p> So , really , if you are near an IHOP today , you should take advantage of the free pancakes . It is your duty as a pancakelovin , Bitchy Waiter-readin American . And I also think this is a good post to share , tweet and shout out because pancakes are not just my icon . They 're a way of life . <p> amend : I have been told that the actual Pancake Day is next Tuesday , March 8 , but that IHOPwanted to get a jump on it so they proclaimed it a week early . Whatever . Go eat a fucking pancake .

Maybe . <p> So , here 's a question : is this customer the most annoying person to ever sit in an Olive Garden or is it the most helpful ? This list of requests , while very specific , can be seen either way . If someone has this many special needs ( breadsticks that are dry and extremely well done ? ? One bowl of soup with two different kinds of soup in it ? ? ) and they verbally asked for each of these , they would would make me want to pull my hair out . ( Truth be told , I would never pull my hair out . It 's too fabulous . ) On the other hand , if you are so fucking needy that you have to type out an explanation of your meal , I kinda do n't want you to sit in my section . 109836 @qwx969836 <h> 48 thoughts on " Most Annoying Olive Garden Customer Ever ? Maybe . " <p> I can understand dressing on the side , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would have saved yourself time cooking at home rather than typing up and printing out however many of these you wanted to prepare . Especially just for soup , salad , and breadsticks ? I 'm hoping this is fake . <p> I have work a co-worker that is deaf as well as his wife . I know they have typed orders for their favorite rest . and if I ever waited on them or any other guest that was deaf this would be helpful and probably save alot of time on my end , , , , but if you are someone that is that picky and do n't  entrust me enough to scratch all that down on my little server pad for you then might I recommend Kroger or Publix <p> I 'm not a waiter so it may be that I do n't  really have standing to weigh in but it does occur to me that anyone who has this specific an order that they type up in advance is someone who might have some kind of disability one that makes communication difficult and/or requires that food orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd hope to cut the customer some slack . But that 's my outsidery view . <p> Gianduja Kiss you are right and yes , maybe one of the diners has something like autism in which case a list like this makes a certain sense . But if this is the case I would recommending calling the restaurant to explain that and then your list wont end up on the internet , because actually , hospo workers are pretty sympathetic towards genuine cases and would never try to shame someone who was coping as best they could with suffering . <p> Without any context , this list seems as needy as the weird guy who used to come into our pizzeria precisely 5 minutes before closing , without fail , order his pizza with all sorts of moderations and specify the precise time he wanted it cooked for . He was just annoying . <p> No , they just do n't  have faith that a lowly server could get this all right . Guessing they have tried to tell them in the past and its been wrong . Ppl who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect this person may suffer from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ; people with OCD feel the need to control aspects of their environment in order to quell the chaos within themselves . This kind of behavior may bind up the anxiety they feel , but does nothing to actually alleviate that anxiety ( think Howard Hughes during his later years ) . <p> OCD is a mental illness , so the question may not be , " How do you deal with a demanding customer ? " as it is , " How do you deal with a customer who may be suffering from a mental illness ? " <p> Exactly what I was thinking . I have a light , but quickly increasing case of obsession happening myself . If this is the case for this person , I totally understand , but would still find it irritating as a server . I would just eat at home . I 'm on the fence on this . <p> here 's a BIG question , how does this person TIP for ALL THIS DETAIL ? ? ? Sounds to me like this person either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " special places " who knows their routine &amp; finds it helpful &amp; not distracting . If you came to MY station in the middle of a HUGE money making rush , you can not expect me to service you well even with this list out of the blue &amp; expect a " perfect meal " . If they were my regular customer , I would be perfectly fine with this . <p> I used to work at Olive Garden about 3 years ago and some of this sounds like regulars we had . At first its a pain but when you see them , just get their stuff , drop it off and turn them as quick as possible to get less fussy people in . I refused to let their mental disorder/picky eating ruin my day . I had money to make and bills to pay . Not that I did n't  resent it though <p> At least if its typed out I know exactly what they want , and if they had a complaint , I could be like , " no , its says right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picky people write all that out , at least it is very clear . <p> Yes ! ! ! ! ! It is SO very annoying to have well-done or dark ordered and presented , only to be told " that 's too dark- I want it a little lighter " or any other myriad , murky descriptors that can be interpreted differently by orderer and preparer ! <p> As a waitress at a retirement home , I get a lot of requests like this for various reasons . While these requests are annoying and take up precious time , I 'd rather get a printed sheet , instead of having to go back and forth from the kitchen to the table because all of their requests were a ) not put in at the same time , or b ) not done correctly . As a server , its our job to get the customer exactly what they want . They might as well have stayed home and made the meal there , but as long as they leave a generous tip for all the extra work , this is fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is ridiculous , mental illness or not . If I had this kind of special requirement list I would stay the hell home &amp; cook my own damn food and not inflict my issues on wait staff . I understand wanting accommodation of simple things but this is too much . <p> This looks like someone trying to scam for free food . Ghetto lemonade , lots of " extra on the side " ( because " extra " and " on the side " = " free " , especially when you left off the onions and peppers , so that translates to " free tomatoes and olives " ) , and if ONE DAMN THING is wrong , there goes your 10% tip , because they went through the trouble to type this up so YOU WOULD HAVE LESS WORK TO DO , including putting ( numbers in parentheses ) for all the ESL kitchen workers , and you could n't even get a SIMPLE SOUP AND SALAD order right ? They should be GETTING PAID to eat , not paying TO eat . They 're practically running the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would rather not have difficult guests in our section , we all know that they are inevitable . I would rather have this sheet of paper given to me , than have had to write all of this down . Get them what they want , hope they are n't  campers , and pray for a decent tip . <p> Meh . I worked at the OG for too long in a past life . Unfortunately this list was very common . What wasnt was having it actually handed to you , which would have been viewed as ridiculous however it wouldve saved A LOT of running around . OG was the best workout arena outside of a gym because of requests like this-you had to always go back to fetch the extra tomatoes , run around looking for a cheese grater , then get the extra plate for the cheese because about the only thing you 'd verbally be told when the party was ordering was they want the one half and half soup , the salad without the stuff and the dry ass breadsticks . Youd only learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paper napkins ( where the hell are those even kept ? you wonder and then panic in your mind as you are in the weeds ) and of course by the time you drop the check , you forgot the 4 mints because you 've been corporate indoctrinated and brain washed that its one mint to a person . Maybe these people wrote this all down not due to mental illness but because they have had one too many arguments with servers who dare to suggest that it will cost extra for the tomatoes and olives and cheese ( because they are supposed to charge for that per corporate capitalist pigs ) OR they realized that they are running the ass off of the server if they do n't  write it all down ( you can do this all on one tray with the list ) OR they are entitled assholes who come into a national restaurant chain of pseudo-Italian food and specialty order the cheapest thing on the menu like its a McGangbang burger because white trash . <p> How kind no , how fucking idiotic this person must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more from my customer than something so simple as , asking for everything they need the first time I go to a table ( because we all know how irritating it is to make multiple trips to the kitchen for a needy table , as soon as we drop off the item of their first request ) . However , in this scenario I disapprove . <p> When you sit down at a restaurant , there is a reason why your waitress/waiter prompts you with a beverage order before taking your meal order : They have other shit to take care of with their other tables . This list screams " I want everything now " . While the instructions do not contain anything beyond the job description of table service , it is incredibly annoying . <p> I 've never worked at Olive Garden , but considering its a chain restaurant , I would assume that the breadsticks are made by the batch , fresh out of the freezer . Baking them a little bit longer does n't  seem like too much of a big deal since we do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the time difference it would take to cook your extra special , extra dry breadsticks Assuming when they 're done , our favorite idiot coworker does n't  " mistakenly " take them before us . <p> As for your soup , ew . Why ruin a good soup by mixing the two ? But that 's not my problem You want a " denser than usual " portion . Like most restaurants , soups are hot and ready to be ladled out of a large vat sitting behind kitchen doors . Olive Garden already has healthy soup portions as it is ( 1 giant ladle scoop or maybe 2 little ladle scoops is required for portion sizing ) . What this person is asking for is free food We all love those tables Especially when soup , salad , and breadsticks are , what ? $15 total ? <p> This fits right up there , for me , with the individuals who are literally allergic to everything on the menu but still choose to go out to eat anyways . Just make your own meal . <p> I am a server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan na ask if you were to imagine this is someone , maybe elderly siblings who live in a home , get out a few times a week , and have little money , but have been coming to OG for a very long time , and they give you this list do you feel the same ? ? ? ? Maybe their children typed the list so they would be able to go out to eat , have a nice time , and not worry about remembering exactly the way they like wverything . Thing is , you do n't  know who it is bc its just a photo of the sheet . Just sayin <p> On one hand , this does save trips . On the other , this sort of shit has become commonplace . Not the list exactly But the insane amount of ridiculous nit-picky nonsense . In my opinion , its too far . That 's a $15 check , and it reeks of someone just requiring that much attention over the cheapest item on the menu because the Corporate pricks will allow it . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this cunt hands their server the Van Halen Tour Rider . <p> I 'm extremely annoyed they are cheap rude and they do n't  care.they are treating their server with no respect to give thier cheap annoying order like this , but i 'm allways nice and do everything as requested it still bothers me that humans can treat eachother this way n i believe unlimited soup n salad .. n breadsticks is insane it invites cheaper people to the table with the employees are punished with cheaper tips cheaper pay u just cant rake much off a 15$check <p> This list is slightly annoying . The cup of ice is probably for the soda in their purse . The lemons is for them to make lemonade at the table . the well done breadsticks , maybe theyll complain that they 're burnt and hope to get freebies or take pictures and post to facebook how bad their experience was . the salad , they are just picking the best of the salad ingredients and leaving the rest . As for the minestone soup , it sounds like they just want all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex more denser . Nope we cant do that . because than the next person will have all broth in their bowl and be mad . I do n't  mind mixing soup though , half and half is fine , but I cant just give you all the veggies and meat and no broth , my boss will get mad . <p> I see this as someone who is either , a . Disabled in some way , or b . Elderly . They may be an elderly couple who have gotten to the point in their life that they just know exactly what they want , and clearly loyal customers to be so specific , they wold have to eat there ALOT ! ! I would appreciate the saved time/trips , and all those chances to make a mistake and give them reason to complain lol ! ! ! I think itd kinda sweet they typed everything hahah <p> GGGGHOWEVER , if this is anyone other than mentioned above and my assumption is wrong then completely disregard the above statement and the customer is annoying as hell ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of customers that need to STAY HOME ! If you are THAT picky about your food , then you need to stay home and cook it yourself ! Clearly none of your friends even want to go to dinner with you if you constantly whip out this piece of paper . I can see the EYE ROLL now ! Seriously , you want to eat your salad right out of the serving bowl ? Why do n't  you just go back to the kitchen and stick a spoon in the soup pot and go to town ! No class . <p> Seriously ! Just make it yourself . What would be the point of going out to eat . Buy a bag of lettuce and make your own salad burn your own breadsticks and make your own bowl of odd throw up soup . If you have serious food allergies that 's one thing a list would be appropriate but just being a picky asshole is going too far . <p> I work at OG ( I know ugh ) and there 's a regular who comes in and always orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just lettuce in the bowl with all of his toppings on the side on separate plates and a ton of extra tomatoes . Dressing and oil/vin on the side . Dry breadsticks with butter on the side . Chicken parm with meat sauce over everything and extra sauce on the side . He always ends up taking the food home because he eats 3 bowls of salad before it comes out . When he does box up the food , he asks for a salad to-go as well , with everything on the side of course and a to-go soup bowl full of extra tomatoes , more dry sticks and he wo n't eat the packaged cheese so he insists on fresh cheese grated into a soup bowl , which just to fill up takes about 3 blocks . He comes in all the time and always sits in my section . And without fail , tips precisely 10% . <p> My gut reaction is to find this annoying as hell . However , upon pondering further , I would much rather be presented with this list than to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am busy . I am not even going to attempt to think too hard about what their motivation is for having this list . Autistic , elderly , crazy , OCD .. does it really matter ? When I think about it , these requests are not THAT much different than many verbals when I add them up . Obviously I would much rather have a low maintenance table with zero modifications ( would n't we all ? ) but if I am busy , once I got over the weirdness of it , I would be glad I had it . It would make my job easier and that 's what I 'm all about . We all kind of know in our gut this is not going to be a good tip any way you look at it ( and I am not talking about the low check total ) , so I would get it right per the list and move on . <p> I can understand that this guest is particular and can certainly respect it ; however , I find it a bit insulting when all is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time to have that human interaction and entrust in my abilities to listen and comprehend your order . <p> If this individual is hearing impaired or is unable to speak , again , understandable- reduces the need to hand write everything at that moments time . But really ? Any other " reason " is pathetic . <p> Used to work at OG . The only acceptable reason for this is a medical condition or hearing impaired . If those two things do n't  apply then you are flat being an asshole , and that assessment has nothing to do with the customer insulting my intelligence as a server and everything to do with how nit-picky this list is . There is n't an OG server anywhere that loves the soup/salad/breadstick meal because , as an earlier reply in this forum stated , its the cheapest meal out there and these types rarely tip well . Its just a fact . So you are going to order the cheapest meal and then specify how you want it made down to the nit pickiest little detail so you can complain if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as my arm is n't correct . Probably makes you feel like the king of the castle ordering around a serVANT . And then leave a paltry little tip to be further insulting . F**k you . <p> I do n't  know what 's worse ; an annoying list like this or people who bring in their own foodstuffs for the kitchen to prepare . I had a family one time bring in a sealed package of gluten-free pasta and demanded it be prepared for their little allergy-ridden snowflake . They were miffed when told by a manager it would be a health code violation . <p> And then there 's the " head cheese " incident , which I wo n't elaborate on right now <p> I can not tell you what a HUGE pain in the ass this order is , whether it is written down or not , whether they are impaired in some way or not . Practically speaking , this order is a nightmare for any OG server . And yes , I know firsthand what I am talking about . <p> First ( 1 ) of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl per 5 persons ordering salad , per table . So I would have to MANUALLY type in special instructions to the salad queens about splitting the salad up into two bowls , and then type in or auto fill-in all the other salad bullshit , and then REPEAT ; <p> Second ( 2 ) of all . after I take several minutes to do the above , and after I 've gotten them **32;113;TOOLONG the side ( hopefully side plates and lemons and ice are stocked , or I have to go run for those , and I have now been sat at my other tables so the pressure is on ) , I then have to go talk to the " bread guy . " The oven for making bread is meant to toast to a **33;147;TOOLONG 8-12 TRAYS of 20 breadsticks each . It takes 10 minutes , approximately , to do this so EVERYONE in the restaurant can have garlic-buttery , medium to light tan bread . OG patrons suck this shit down like humpback whales on krill . So now I have to explain to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first language , to monopolize the entire oven and bread area for this one table , and make me 12 breadsticks very well done , and do not butter them . If he burns them , does n't  burn them enough , forgets he is not to butter them.we start all over . And the rest of the servers and patrons have to wait on bread which creates a feeding frenzy like blood in the water until " bread homeostasis " is achieved again . Since I assume they want their bread with their soup melange and their duo salads . I cant do jack shit at this point except ask the salad queens to remake the salads because they fucked up the first two and , btw , I STILL need those 2 sides of dressing , extra tomatoes , and olives . " oh , you need ramikins ? " Well hell now I 've added a trip to the DMO to grab some dripping ramikins and stock the salad area to my time with this order . <p> .. In the interim , my other 2 tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge , listening to crickets while my manager scowls wondering what the fuck I am doing . All of the above , assuming everything is stocked and goes perfectly takes 12 minutes of me being off the floor if I attend to these guests right away , which I will do because all soup &amp; salad &amp; breadstick folks think their order is so easy you should just crack that out and get them their food asapits not like they have to wait for anything to be cooked right ? 13 minutes pass since seating and list-giving . " Hey are you busy ? Can you greet my 301 ? Can you run 302 ? 324 has totally put me in the weeds becomes my lament in the kitchen . " <p> Thirdly ( 3 ) of all . breads burnt &amp; dry , basketed and loaded on tray ; soup is clusterfucked and loaded ; 2 large-ass salad bowls and salad tongs with 6 side plates of dressing , tomatoes , butter , and olives are loaded on the tray ; and , a cheese grater ( making for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Find a server to follow me with shit . 15 minutes . <p> Get to the table drop it all off , grate the hell out of the cheese , now they need water &amp; lemon refills. 18 minutes to " Enjoy your meal ! " Now I 'm in the weeds with tables that WILL leave me a decent tip . WAY TOO MUCH fucking work , for whatever reason , for what we all know will be a $3 to $5 tip . And do n't  forget , its UNLIMITED soup , salad , and breadsticks.you can bet they will want a refill on all , then I will need to box up the leftovers ( dry salad means they will order refills to take home ) . <p> This order is total bullshit , written or oral . Either stay the fuck home or make it the To-go persons problem ! The REASON behind the order is irrelevant . The work is still the same . I will smile through it and move on , remembering that I will get great tips for far less work down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a soup , salad , &amp; breadstick order you need a butler &amp; a cook , not a server at a chain restaurant . Amen . <p> Oh and fuck I forgot the paper napkinsshit they 're not stocked in the center isle , AS THEY SHOULD BE , run , RUN , to the dry storage , look for them all over the fucking place because NOTHING is ever put in the same place twice " holy shit is that an unopened box of them on the very top shelf ? " Grab the ladder , climb up , struggle to rip open the shipping box ( praying OGs workmans comp insurance is up to date ) , sway on the ladder grab a large pack , ripped it open while speed walking back to the table , give them their napkins with a smile , put away the rest as I speed walk to my other two tables now totally pissed and take their orders , trying not to drip sweat on their tables . Just a day in the life . <p> Something I learned many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Even if you NAIL their requests , they will A ) find something wrong , or B ) Tip poorly while thanking you for your great service . <p> You learn early on who these types are , and set them in other stations , away from you .

I took myself to breakfast this morning because I could n't bear to start my day with another bowl of Cheerios and banana with a yogurt chaser . I found a quaint little diner that was going to satisfy my craving for eggs and toast . Yes , I could make these myself , but I wanted them to be cooked by someone else and then served by a waiter .

And what did Megan think ? " Oh , Daddy , you are n't  going tot throw away these perfectly good sunglasses away after you just spent $10 on them . That would be silly , you dumb fuck of a daddy .

It looks like the kind of drink a priest would have when you have him come over to your house for a visit . Do you know what I mean ? Does n't  it ? Does n't  it ? " <p> " Yes , maam . That 's exactly what I was thinking . Do you need anything else ? " This lady was weird with a capital Annoying . <p> The rest of her time in my station was uneventful .

@@106055247 @1455247/ <h> Facebook is the New Complaint Box For Restaurants <p> I fell into a deep dark hole last night that I had a very difficult time pulling myself out of . I 'm not talking about the camel toe that was happening at Table 4 . I 'm talking about reading the comments on the Facebook pages of major chain restaurants . They are hilarious . If you are in need of a way to kill at least an hour of your time , by all means , follow my example . There was a time when if a customer had an issue with their meal or service in a restaurant , they simply told their server or asked to speak to a manager . They would have a face to face conversation ; the customer explaining their issue and the staff coming up with a solution . Times have changed and it seems that the way people are most comfortable complaining nowadays is via a Facebook Page . AND USING THE CAPS LOCK BUTTON TOO . I guess its just easier to go to Facebook than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Chili 's . The main thing I noticed about the Chili 's Facebook Page is that there are a lot of people in Kaufman , Texas who want a Chili 's in their town . Post after post is from sad individuals in Texas who are craving some crappy food from Sysco . <p> Poor Cari . She probably only has Pizza Hut , Applebee 's and Sonic to satisfy her urge for sub-par food from a chain restaurant . <p> Some people are on the page to compliment Chilis , like Tara who loves the new look at her local Chilis and is probably taking notes so that she can spruce up her home . No HGTV for Tara . Shes got Chilis ! <p> After I grew tired of the whining about Chilis I went to the Facebook Page of Applebees for even more entertainment . The first comment that caught my eye was that of Mary Elizabeth who apparently does not know what the mute button is for on her remote control . <p> Ironic , is n't it , that she is complaining about " nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet equivalent ? <p> And what about Jessi who practically had her childs birthday ruined when the servers would n't sing happy birthday to him ? I can imagine that Jessis server went to the kitchen and yelled out those dreaded four words , " I need birthday singers " and the servers all scattered like roaches when you turn on the kitchen light in the middle of the night . <p> I do agree with Jessi that it was shameful that the server dropped half of the dessert on the floor and left it there without offering a replacement . However , I think the first indication that her childs birthday was going to be shitty was when she pulled into the parking lot of Applebees . <p> Jennifer went to the Facebook page to let them know that she has officially given up on Applebees . <p> With that many poor experiences at an Applebees you would think she would have given up a long time ago , but Jennifer is not a quitter . She likes to make sure something really really sucks ass before she decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the food , raw chicken ? No big deal , but I guess the bad service was just the straw that broke the camel toes back . However , it looks like the Guest Relations Team is going to send Jennifer a coupon to give them one last chance to prove to her that they deserve her respect . If I know Jennifer , ( and I totally do n't  ) she will go back to Applebees as soon as she gets that $5 coupon . <p> I think my favorite thing about all the posts on these pages is that Facebook let 's me embed them on my very own blog so that people who read my blog can interact directly with Chilis and Applebees customers . Ah , technology . Feel free to add your comments to the Facebook posts . Its fun , but beware : if you start to read all the complaints , you will quickly lose two hours of your day and some of your brain cells will rot away as you try to understand what some of them are saying . If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - you might want to save them . However , the sheer joy I get from reading complaints on Facebook is almost worth losing a few brain cells . I 'm already a dumb ass so I may as well be a dumber ass . 109836 @qwx969836 <h> 22 thoughts on " Facebook is the New Complaint Box For Restaurants " <p> I love this so much . After seeing your post about Chilis on Facebook yesterday I too took a long and dark journey into the world of chain restaurant Facebook comments . I recognize all the ones you posted from Chilis . They are so entertaining . <p> You missed the best one Its on Chilis main page . A customer at one of their restaurants went in to ask the manager if she could I kid you not have her 5 6 y.o. ? daughters birthday dinner at that location and then pay them on their next paycheck ! ! ! which would be after said dinner . <p> Seems that some of the other patrons and a waitress heard about it and threw the kid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All because the family had fallen on " hard times " . I only put that in quotes because 1 . this family is not starving as evidenced by Mom and Dad in the pics and 2. when you do n't  have the means to take your kid out to dinner for her birthday YOU STAY HOME and make her a meal and a cake . Period . NO they did n't  ask for the party and I applaud the restaurant and patrons for their kindness and YES all parents want their kids to have a nice birthday but when you DO NOT HAVE THE MEANS STAY THE FUCK HOME and stop asking for favors , like paying after the fact . <p> Shes six , shell get over it . <p> My daughter celebrated her 16th birthday , at home it was on the second day of school at her new HS We had previously been homeless because we had lost our home where she had lived her whole life due to my health we have insurance , but it does n't  pay for everything We moved to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't  know one single person to invite . We scraped enough money together to buy her a pair of tennis shoes and a magazine subscription . I made her dinner and her cake . I would never have DREAMED of asking to pay for something " after the fact " for a 6 y.o.s birthday let alone my 16 y.o.s sweet sixteen . I love my daughter and it damn near broke my heart to have her so alone for such a special day , but really ? She survived . Just fine . <p> The " can I pay later " birthday beats David asking for a coupon all to hell . <p> Thank you so much for saying that you too Anonymous . Were in our new home and she has made so many friends . Her 17th birthday is right around the corner and it will be nice to be able to invite them all over for a cookout . But shhhhits going to be a surprise . She knows money will always be a little tight as long as I am i 'll , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . I cant wait . She really is a good kid . Thank you again . <p> It might be a symptom of working at Applebees When I worked at Chilis I made so much effort to be an amazing server . Until getting 5% 10% tips at every table ( with only a few exceptions ) made me stop putting in the effort since I was getting paid the same for crappy service anyway I 've since escaped from serving . <p> EXACTLY . people do n't  understand how unmotivated we get , because shit like that happens to us DAILY . <p> I was working at Olive Garden , and was hoping that the little money I was making ( not even $50/shift ) was due to the location and season . I would come home after every shift crying because I could n't pay my bills .. Then get to work and have to deal with the same stuff . <p> People seriously think were robots and should never make a mistake . <p> Now I work in an office , and I hate it more than restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up on my bills . Serving made me really start to hate people <p> I work at Applebees . Now , Ive done fine dining but multiple moves that were necessary left me with a resume that included 2 jobs I left in 4 months . Not good . So on my final move I took a job at Applebees . Its good money but harder than any job I 've had . That 's facing 6 years of industry experience and 6 companies . Its hell . As a closer Im generally one of four servers with 8 tables more , including a few 6 tops . People treat you like shit , you have very little support staff , and we cant do anything about the kitchen sucking . Add our ancient computer system that 's slower than MICROs and its a real shit storm <p> Holy shit ! ! ! Yall seriously need to check out the Chilis page , like 60% of comments in there are asking for a Chilis in that Kaufman , TX . It is hilarious as hell ! ! I read on and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its beyond funny . <p> One day I 'll make a special trip to Kaufman , TX just to see those people lol <p> I worked in a fine dining restaurant that had black linen napkins . Same crazy ladies would say " do you not have white napkins ? I have on white pants " with a look of disgust like she was being asked to use garbage to clean herself . People are loons . <p> Yes ! I do n't  have the fb ( however i do regret not seeing bws other works posted there ) so i enjoy the yelp comments too ! Especially the ones not recommended at the very bottom . Its definitely time-passing outlandish humor.people are fascinating ! <p> I wish I knew you , Bitchy . I think we would be friends .

And in honor of vacation , here is a post about this delusional woman from a few months ago . <p> xo , The Bitchy Waiter <p> This lady came in the other day and she 's always a little bit of a pain in the ass . Just because she 's a semi-regular , she thinks that she deserves special treatment . You know the type . As soon as she sat down she said she wanted something special to make her feel like she was on a tropical vacation . I hate when people say stupid shit like that . I wanted to suggest that she put on an ugly one piece bathing suit with a ruffle and then get a sunburn while listening to Tom Jones on her Walkman because I figured that 's what she usually did when on a tropical vacation . Instead , I simply asked her what she would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so complicated question . Suddenly her eyes lit up as she realized what drink would satisfy this tropical craving she was trying to fill . I could n't wait for her to ask for a Pina Colada or Banana Daiquiri so I could tell her we do n't  have a blender . And then she asked for something that is so completely incongruous with tropical that I thought she was kidding . " Can I have a Frangelico and coffee ? " She said it all whispery and shit with this snarky grin like it was so so daring of her to order this wild and crazy drink . What the fuck kind of tropical vacation does this bitch go on that she sits on a beach and drinks coffee ? Is it a beach in Antarctica ? Is she retarded ? Then she altered her order a bit and requested iced coffee which made it a teeny bit more understandable . " And can you put some whipped cream on it so it really seems fancy ? " Yeah , lady . Every drink I have ever had while on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me think it was fancy , will do . I put about six inches worth of whipped cream on her drink because I knew it would make her wet her panties when she saw it . If I would have had one of those little paper umbrellas I would have stuck that in it too , but no such luck . Instead , I did one of those tricks you do with the paper of a straw to make it look like it was a flower . She squealed with pleasure when she saw it . This lady really needs a life . Or a vacation . But she loved me . Bitch loves her some Bitchy Waiter . 109837 @qwx969837 
@@106055253 @1455253/ <h> Waitress Hits Customer With Coffee Pot ; Becomes My Hero <p> Not a day go by it seems where there is n't a waiter or waitress in the news for something . Either a waiter is having his finger broken by a customer or a waitress is winning $104,000 on The Price Is Right . Today I see in the news that in the sleepy town of Beaufort , South Carolina a waitress was sent to jail for hitting a customer up against the side of her head with a coffee pot . The story goes that it was the overnight shift at the Waffle House and after waiting for 25 minutes to be served , a customer got into an argument with the waitress resulting in the head banging with said coffee pot . The police were called at 3:20 AM and they found what was believed to be marijuana in the waitress apron pocket . Wait , you mean a waitress who works the overnight shift at the fucking Waffle House in Beaufort , South Carolina has to be on drugs in order to get through that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was needed which basically means the waitress did n't  hit the lady hard enough . She was arrested on charges of misdemeanor assault and battery and possession of marijuana and then released on her own recognizance . To top it all off , she probably had to go back to the fucking Waffle House and finish her sidework which consisted of filling the syrups , stocking the butters and mopping the floor . <p> This story makes me sad . As usual , I was n't there , but of course I side with the waitress . I imagine that the customer was some tired old hag who was siting in the smoking section and had been nursing her black coffee since she got off her cashier shift at the Piggly Wiggly down the street . ( Okay , just so you know , I totally made up that there was a Piggly Wiggly down the street but a quick Google map search shows that there really is one ! Ah , the south . ) <p> The customer probably ordered the chocolate chip pancakes with toffee syrup and whipped cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking forever to get her food . The waitress looked at the computer and saw it had only been eight minutes and when she told the customer it had n't  really been " forever , " the customer got all whiny and bitchy and called the waitress a name insulting her position as head waitress of the overnight shift at Waffle House . You know , because in the world of Beaufort , South Carolina a cashier at Piggly Wiggly is way above a waitress at Waffle House but still far below the position of stock manager at the Walmart Super Center which is also right down the street in the opposite direction of Piggly Wiggly . ( Seriously , I Googled that too . ) Our waitress , who may or may not have been buzzed on A&amp;W Root Beer , sub-par bacon and marijuana , could n't take it anymore and popped that bitch in the head with one of those metal coffee pots and said , " Bitch your fucking pancakes will be ready when they 're ready , now shut the fuck up . " Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( And if you are reading this and you are either the waitress or the customer , how youdoin ? ) <p> The whole story leaves us with a lot of questions : <p> Why did the cops feel the need to search the waitress apron ? <p> Did they have a search warrant or were they just looking for a pen to take notes with ? <p> Did the waitress get to keep her job ? <p> Did the customer ever get her chocolate chip pancakes ? <p> Who did the paper work and covered the floor after they carted the waitress ass away ? Surely there was n't more than one waitress on the floor at the Waffle House at 3:20 AM . <p> Another great post . You are so damned funny . I side with the waitress , too . I 'm a closet Waffle House fan and my experience tells that each of these servers must have a very high threshhold for bullshit . They 've seen every kind of sad-assed customer that crawls up to their yellow counter looking for something smothered and covered.So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , it must be because she had it coming ! <p> Shiit . My very 1st waitress job was at a Waffle House . In addition to dealing with drunken morons , ( customers AND coworkers ) , we had to wash the fucking dishes , hand-dry the damn silverware , and manually add up each ticket , including sales tax ! It was 1996 , but I do hope technology has made it a bit less of a pain in the ass to work there . Then again , it IS Waffle House . = <p> Did you know that Beaufort rhymes with " you fert " ? I lived in nearby Savannah , GA for a year a year ago and just thought I 'd mention it . I totally can envision that scenario and am reminded that I am so glad I no longer reside in the south.I was thinking this morning about starting my own blog , non-hospitality business related , but you have raised the bar so high with your delightful wit that I feel a little intimidated . <p> Dear Bitchy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pic has my Bitch Proud bracelet in it , but now I want that hard workin Waffle House Hero to win what would have most likely been MY shoes . Please.Love , Jodie <p> Just for the record .. Waffle House does n't have computersyou have to " call out " and " mark " the plates ( I used to slave there ) and secondi doubt she waited 25 minutes for food at 3 amare you KIDDING ME ? ? People looking for something for free . Go waitress ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> " 9 . Is marijuana really enough ? " I almost snorted Chardonnay up my nose ! Ha ! This reminds me of a movie with Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer where she was a waitress in a coffee shop in NYC . She and her co-worker band together to get revenge on a customer . One server trips the other server , who has a coffee pot in hand . Hot coffee spills on the customer and hilarity ensues . My personal weapon of choice , should I ever let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the ones at my restaurant is the size and weight of a child 's baseball bat . Can you imagine the sound of that cracking against a douche bags skull ? I sure can . Batter up ! <p> I love Waffle House ! Their hash browns are to die for ! Anyone with any sense knows that you DO NOT mess with Waffle House waitresses ; they are some scary ass bitches , especially if they are working at 3 a.m. ! <p> My guess is either they are related by blood or one of them is dating/living with/married to the other 's ex . They have to be well acquainted . Then again , small town living . I can appreciate why the waitress snapped . I hope she is going to be okay . Yes , I think I waitressed too long to have any sympathy for the loud mouth customer . <p> I have visited Waffle Houses late at night . The male patrons , mostly truckers , are laid-back and flirtatious , but the female patrons are nearly all ill-tempered bitches ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honeysuckle and gardenias ! BTW I have dealt with the general public . They always think that any atrocious behavior on their part is covered by the phrase , " the customer is ALWAYS right ! " Whoever coined that dangerous over-quoted phrase needs to face a firing squad of sales clerks and waitresses ! <p> you go girl ! ! the damn coffee pot cost more than your paycheck amounts to . I know I worked there for two weeks and could n't take it any longer . o/ow ( waffle house lingo order over well ) well done ! ! ! ! and video clips , this blog could undeniably be one of the most beneficial in its niche .

I hope you will take a moment to read some of these other fine bloggers to see what they think about Valentines day . My post is below . Its called Fuck Cupid . Because , I 'm sweet that way . <p> Valentines Day is upon us and that means its time to come up with the most romantic and unique gesture of love to show that special someone that you really care . That is , of course , if you are actually in a relationship . If you are single , then Valentines Day is basically a reminder that you are alone and no one loves you .

So one year I decided that I would just sit in my dorm room and watch television and treat myself to a pizza . I called up Dominos to place my order and began my night of celebrating myself . ( Masturbation . ) When the pizza arrived , I opened the box to see the most disgusting thing that could be delivered to a lonely person on Valentines Day . The pizza was shaped like a goddamn fucking heart . It was a slap in the face to me who wanted to forget that everyone I knew was out with their boyfriend or their girlfriend . On the box was scrawled " Happy Valentines Day ! " but it may as have well said , " What kind of sad loser spends Valentines Day alone in your dorm room ? You suck .

Happy Valentines Day . <p> Years later when I was partnered and we had celebrated many Valentines Days , we made the decision to not really acknowledge that day anymore . No more gifts or flowers or chocolates . Just dinner if we felt like it . One night we had tickets to a show so we wanted to go to our favorite Italian restaurant before . It was a Tuesday night so we were surprised to see how crowded it was . We sat down and were given the menu which was much more expensive than it was the last time we had eaten there . The menu was all prix fixe and came with a bottle of wine . " What happened ? Why is it so expensive now ? " we wanted to know . We were told it was Valentines Day so they had created a special menu for us . Bull fucking shit . We did n't  even know it was February 14th .

So I say if you 're single on Valentines day , live it up . Be happy that you do n't  have all the expectations of those folks who are part of a couple .

The hostess has to make sure that every server is getting their fair share of tables so she is not bitched at later that night for playing favorites and letting one server make more money than another . Also , if she sat three tables in a row in the same station , then that server is going to be slammed and will not be able to give the service that we all know he wants to give . Trust the hostess . She has been highly trained to ensure that customers are being seated in the best possible way . Pay no attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in her hair . She is a pro . <p> Last night at the club , we had a busy show . It was pretty full meaning that it was imperative that the seat assignments that were given at the door stay in tact . Customers do n't  get it . " But I wan na sit with my friend on that side of the room , " they say and meander to another table . It does not work like that , people . Some nights we may have as many as four different cover charges for the show . Maybe someone had a discount code or paid in advance or are a comp . The only way I know how much to charge someone is based on the slip of paper the hostess gives to the customer which also tells the which seat they are in . So when they move to another table and leave that slip , I have no clue how much to charge them . <p> When I was setting up the room last night , I noticed that table 39 was broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that the seat had candle wax on it . We were seconds away from opening the house , so I mentioned to the hostess to not seat anyone at that table and I would take care of it after the show . Cue Mr. Latecomer who showed up one minute before showtime . He was assigned a seat right next to the stage because its first come first serve and his ass got there too late to warrant any kind of decent seating . I took his order as the lights were dimming and went to get his beer . When I came back into the darkened room , the singer now performing , Mr. Latecomer was not at his table anymore . A quick scan of the room showed me he had dragged his ass over to table 39 . I placed the beer on the lopsided table and hoped for the best . Five minutes later , he flags me down . <p> " Excuse me , " he whispered , " but do you have wet towel ? There is something all over this chair ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " A wet towel wont do the trick . " <p> He stood up ( the show is happening about 18 inches from where he is , keep in mind ) and starts to brush off his pants . It was pointless , because the candle wax was dried anyway and did n't  get on his pants at all . " Well , I need a new seat . " <p> " Maybe you would like to go back to the one we assigned you , sir ? This table is also broken which is why we did not seat you here in the first place . You sat yourself here , remember ? " <p> He sat back down defeated and maybe a little bit embarrassed . I handed him a bev nap so he could give another futile attempt at scraping the wax off the seat . Experience tells me that the only way that shit comes off is by scraping it with a credit card but I wanted to watch him try anyway . He eventually gave up and conceded to watching the show while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dried white substance . On second thought , I can only assume it was candle wax . I never actually saw the candle spill . Who knows , maybe the hostess took her break at this table and the hardened white " wax " was residual fun left over from her time with a cook at the dumpster . <p> I serve at two different places . Both of them have candles on every table . One place has real candles that people constantly knock over sending hot melted wax onto the table , floor , chair , my uniform and if I 'm lucky onto themselves . The other place has those battery operated candles that look like real ones . They even flicker and have fake wax drips going down the side of them . Once they are placed inside a classy frosted votive candle holder , no one knows the difference . Overall , I like the fake candles better because I never have to clean up wax , I do n't  burn the hair on my forearms when I am reaching across a table , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Kids like them too . Therein lies the rub . <p> Countless times , I have had a family sit in my station and the kids gravitate to the " candle " like moths to a flame . Or like me to a bottle of Citron . The parents ask me to bring a couple of extra ones so the kids can play with them like they are flashlights . Yeah that 's a great idea , Mom and Dad . Let 's teach your two year old child that candles are something to play with so the next time they go to a restaurant that has candles with actual flaming fire , the kids can grab at it . How is a two year old going to differentiate ? Again , I am not a parent ( although my dog turned 13 years old yesterday and he is officially an old lady dog ) but it just seems like a bad idea to let kids play with fake candles . Couldnt they unknowingly be raising a perfect little pyromaniac ? Its stupid . What I would love to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one night so that every parent who let 's their child immediately grab at them as soon as they sit down could learn a quick lesson in fire safety . Never fear , I would n't actually do that . Just like I would never dip a toddlers spoon in Tobasco- . Or turn the bathroom light out when a kid goes in there by himself . Or put honey in the seat of a stroller when a parent crams it into the side stand to " get it out of the way . " Or discreetly drop a childs toy on the floor when no one is looking so they will leave it at the restaurant and I can throw it away . Or give a kid Diet Coke instead of regular just to see if theyll notice . These are just things that I think about doing in order to pass the time at work . It beats refilling the salt and pepper shakers . <p> Anyhoo , back to candles . Fake candles=good . Efficient , money saving , safe and just as pretty . But do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan na hear about it when they see candles on their birthday cake and end up with blistered hands because they thought it was a toy like the one where that bitchy waiter works . <p> The topic of candles has come up before on this blog , most notably when some lady caught her hair on fire after she got too close to her birthday cupcake with a candle in it . Still makes me laugh . Read it here . When you work with dozens and dozens of candles night after night , a fire is inevitable and it happened once again a couple of weeks ago . Sadly , it was not hair that burned because that is the funniest event in the world right after old ladies falling off of bicycles and babies projectile vomiting on their parents . <p> As I was taking orders on my side of the room , I was overcome with the smell of something rank . It took me a moment to realize it was not the regular at table 35 who is rumored to have a vagina similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grabbed my cell phone , put it in video mode and scanned the room in the hope that I would see someone covered in ash and patting their hair . I saw nothing . At the service bar , I was told that another server had caught a basket of chips on fire . At the club , we serve some light snacks like cheese and crackers and chips and salsa . The basket of chips is lined with a paper napkin because we like to keep it classy up in there . I guess she had positioned the basket too close to the candle and the whole thing went up in flames . Why did I miss seeing that ? Since I did n't  actually see it happen , I can only assume that it happened like this : <p> The waitress smiles at table 20 and puts their food order down . " Here you are . An order of chips and and freshly made salsa . Please do enjoy your evening and do not hesitate to let let me know if there is anything I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyable . " As she begins to walk away , she notices that the basket of chips is a smidgen too close to the candle so she reaches over to pull it to safety . As she does so , the flame from the candle leaps to the paper napkin and quickly engulfs it in fiery inferno . Knowing that she only has seconds before the napkin lights the wicker basket on fire as well , the waitress grabs the basket and puts it back on the tray . The customer begins to scream with fear because she has had a severe case of arsonphobia ever since she was ten years old when she caught her elementary school on fire after she lit an errant bottle rocket one fourth of July . She begins to panic and our waitress has to decide whether to help her guest or deal with the fire . She looks to the panicked customers husband for help only to see him paralyzed with fear and mumbling about a fire safety class he took as a Boy Scout in 1979 . At this point Smokey the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he met on Manhunt.com , gets up from booth 1 and pulls a fire extinguisher out of his back pack . He uses the P.A.S.S . sysytem ( pull , aim , squeeze , sweep ) and gets the fire under control . By now , the woman has passed out and our waitress is now giving her mouth to mouth resuscitation which is a bonus for the waitress because the customer is kinda hot and the waitress is bi-curious . Her husband notices his wife making out with the waitress and immediately snaps back to reality and says , " Oh , so now you 're into a threesome ? " The woman comes to and the waitress asks her is she 's alright and if shed like a cigarette . Smokey the Bear goes to get a roll of paper towels to clean up the mess from the fire extinguisher and the husband follows him to ask him if he s into role-playing . After everything is cleaned up and the husband has exchanged phone numbers with Smokey , the show begins only five minutes later than planned . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happen , its just conjecture . In all likelihood , the waitress simply placed the flaming basket of chips onto her tray and ran it to the bar where it was thrown into the sink and doused with water . But my version is much better . <p> Remember , only you can prevent baskets of chips and salsa going up in flames . <p> Working in the world of restaurants and catering , there are always candles around . And when there are candles around , it is only a matter of time before some bitch catches her hair on fire . I have seen it happen on more than one occasion and it never fails to amuse me . As long as I know they are safe , I mean . I do n't  want to see anyone rushed to the burn unit but when someones hair catches on fire for five or ten seconds , it always brightens my day . Most recently , it happened at The Place that Shall Not Be Named . I was at a table making up the specials when out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright light . A woman two tables away was frantically throwing her head around while everyone else at her table was freaking out . The woman started to scream and it was then that I realized she had done got her hair caught on fire . I guess it was her birthday , so the server brought out a cupcake with a candle on it and before you know it , the Aqua Net that only seconds before was keeping her coif in place , was now aflame . Since I was n't actually at the table I can only imagine how it went down . <p> ( A server steps to the table with the cupcake and birthday candle . ) Birthday Girl : Oh my gosh ! That is so sweet . Oh , how cute . Thank you ! ( The guest start to sing " Happy Birthday " as the server places the cupcake in front of Birthday Girl . ) Random Guest : Lemme take your picture with my phone before you blow out the candle ! Birthday Girl : Oh , that is such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Random Guest : Get closer , I cant get you and the cupcake . ( Birthday Girl puts her face closer to the cupcake . ) Birthday Girl : Is this better ? Random Guest : Closer . Birthday Girl : Is this close enough ? I do n't  wan na get too close because- OH MY GOD ! Sweet Jesus , my hair is on fire . My hair is on fire ! Random Guest : ( click ) Got it ! That 's totally a new Facebook profile picture ! <p> Within seconds , the smell of Birthday Girls singed follicles permeated the room . Tables began to question what the smell was , of course . Since I did n't  want anyone to think that it was our high quality , organic , farm-to-table food , I told every single one of my tables that the horrible odor they were smelling was burned hair . From the lady at table 26 . I then pointed to table 26 so they would know exactly who just had the most embarrassing moment of her life . It was fun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was going on around them . My hateful , miserable , bitchy managers would probably not have been happy to know that I shared that info with so many people , but my tables deserved to know . <p> Reminds me of this time in high school when this girl got pissed off at some other ho . So she went up behind her during the passing period when the hallway was really crowded and put a Bic lighter up to her hair . Her whole head went up in flames , because it was the 80s and her hair was saturated in mousse , hair spray and DippityDoo . That smell lingered for days . She was alright though . It still makes me laugh . <p> The moral of the story : hair and fire do not mix . But if you insist upon catching your hair on fire , please make sure someone takes a picture or video of it , so it can go viral . 109838 @qwx969838

Any number of things could have happened that would make for such an awful experience and cause her to leave a 1-star review . Maybe her food came out completely wrong and rather than apologizing , her server slapped her up against the side of her head . Sure , that would make me want to leave a 1-star review . Or perhaps Jacquei was disappointed with the way the food was prepared because the menu said the pork chop was nut-free but it was actually covered in peanuts and when she ate it her lips swelled up to the size of two bloated caterpillars .

Let 's be honest ; Bitchy Waiter has been a little lacking in the posts lately , so if he needs me to help him out , I 'm more than happy to do it . <p> First , off , only nine days until the Never-Ending Pasta Pass , otherwise known as " 49 Days of Heaven , " begins and I have shared my countdown clock with you so you can all bookmark it and count the seconds with me . <p> So OG is in the news because some fancy-schmancy shareholder of the company wrote a 294 page report on how they think things can be better at Olive Garden and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  read all 294 pages of the report because quite honestly , I- have been- trying to catch up on my Netflix viewing before Gilmore Girls is released . The main points that I feel should be responded to are the ones below : <p> " Too many breadsticks . " Ummm , no . There is no such thing as " too many breadsticks . " This guy is saying that they use 700 million breadsticks a years and that too many of them go to waste . Hello , its called " unlimited breadsticks " for a reason . He also suggests that they change the recipe . This would be the most awful thing ever to happen in America . They are perfect the way they are and if I want to ask for more , I will . And if I want to put a few in my purse , I will do that too , because those breadsticks are even better the next day if you wrap them in a damp paper towel and put them in the microwave for about ten seconds . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an Olive Garden Bread ( stick ) - Pudding with them . It was delicious and my cat really seemed to enjoy it very much . This- report is suggesting that each customer gets only one breadstick and then one extra for the table . What are we supposed to do , share that last breadstick ? Its ridiculous . They say they will bring us more when we ask for them , but unlimited means that I do n't  have to ask ! The waitress should supply me with an endless amount of breadsticks and I eat as many as I want . I AM PAYING FOR THEM ! If I choose to not eat them that is my prerogative . <p> " The pasta is over-cooked and needs salt . " Their pasta is perfect .

I have a whole set of it at home and whenever I get too much , I just put some of- it on Craigslist and I 'm always able to sell it . They are so fancy and nice . I would be very sad if they started using regular Styrofoam . Who do they think they are , some low-class restaurant like Friendlys ? Yes , those containers might cost a lot for the company , but we the customers are spending a lot on the food and deserve those heavy duty containers . If they change them , I will just have to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing . " The report says that servers are bring too much dressing because they are too lazy to possibly make a second trip . While , I disagree that there is too much dressing on the salad , I do agree that the servers are lazy . Personally , I like a lot of salad dressing on my salad because it helps to disguise the taste of the lettuce and vegetables . I only eat the salad because I know its good for me , but I have never had to ask for seconds on it . I have found that one small bowl of salad nicely balances the three or four bowls of pasta and the unlimited breadsticks . If they are concerned about the cost of too much dressing , maybe they should pay their servers less and save money that way . The customer should not lose out on Ranch . <p> I want to say thank you to all of my fans out there and to Bitchy Waiter for letting me do his job for him on this blog .

I also want to let you know that I have really listened to your comments about not tipping the waitress when I use my Pasta Pass .

Look , its a really nice night outside and seeing that we only have about four or five nights like this a year in New York City , we decided to open up the windows to the restaurant . We also decided to leave the door to the patio open so that we could have Mother Nature blow a nice cool breeze through the place instead of our sad excuses for ceiling fans . And our air conditioner does n't  really condition the air as much as it distributes dust and mold to those hard to reach areas of the dining room like the top shelves of the to-go station and where we keep the extra coffee mugs . You chose to sit near the open windows meaning you were willing to accept whatever consequences may come from that . Our restaurant is right next door to a bar and sometimes those bar patrons like to stand on the sidewalk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , but back to you , Guy at Table 5 : chill the fuck out . <p> As I am standing at the computer and surveying my section , I notice that Cigarette Sally and Paul the Pipe from The Bar Next Door have moved to the sidewalk . I watch them light up and envy that they are standing outside in the cool breeze instead of where I am which is too close to the kitchen , too close to the customers , too close to the steak knives that are just right for slicing my wrist but not close enough to my shift drink . I notice you , Guy at Table 5 , suddenly start to spin your head like Linda Blair on a Tilt-a-Whirl ; your nose crinkling up as you sniff the air like a hound dog catching the scent of a rabbit that has been marinated in Alpo . Your eyes catch sight of the smokers and you start to wave your hand in front of your face to get rid of the stench , much the same way I did when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . I do n't  know if you 're allergic to smoke or if you are just a hypersensitive drama queen who grabs every chance to overreact . Its not like they are smoking cyanide and oleander and blowing it in your face . They are outside about thirty feet away . You call me over to your table . <p> " Theyre smoking out there . " <p> " Yes , they do that , " I say . <p> " I can smell it . " <p> " Yes , I know . So can I , " I mentally congratulate each of us for having the blessed sense of smell which I sometimes would be willing to give up when I am on the 7 train . <p> " What can you do about it ? " he wants to know . <p> I think about how nice it would be to use this guys face as an ash tray but simply tell him , " They should be done soon . They 're on the sidewalk and they 're not our customers so I cant ask them to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut the windows and doors , cant you ? " <p> At this point his girlfriend interjects . " Its okay . Its fine . Do n't  worry about it . " <p> " But you can shut the doors and windows , right ? " he asks again . <p> " Yes , I can do that . " <p> " No , its okay , you do n't  have to , " says the girlfriend . <p> " That would be great , " says Guy at Table 5 . <p> The one fucking nice night that we can take advantage of this shitty ass climate I live in , and this asshole is going to ask me to shut the doors and windows so he can eat his hamburger free from the two minutes of smoke that is happening OUTSIDE the restaurant . I close the two windows and shut the front door to the restaurant disappointing not only myself but all the flies in the neighborhood who had heard that it was their night to finally get a firsthand peek at our walk-in . Within five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees and my mood drops about a hundred . Guy at Table 5 is as happy as a turd in a toilet bowl while everyone else is wondering why the restaurant just get so hot and stagnant . I keep my eyes on Cigarette Sally and Paul the Pipe and as soon as I see them put out their torches , I head back to the windows and doorsto open them up again . I do n't  bother asking Guy at Table 5 , because he s probably too busy wondering where the meat from his burger was sourced ( Key Food ) and if his girlfriend is going to let him have sex with her tonight ( she 's not ) . <p> The next thirty minutes happen without incident until I notice out of the corner of my bloodshot eye that his head is spinning and he is sniffing the air again . I look out the window to see a man standing there sucking on the biggest , thickest , smokiest cigar I have ever seen . Cigar Sam , we call him . It smells horrible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Guy at Table 5 because I 'd rather have a cool breeze that may occasionally smell slightly of cigar than no cool breeze at all . I walk past Table 5 , and see that Guy has his hand covering his mouth . His girlfriend is finishing her meal and ignoring the dramatics so I figure if she can ignore them so can I. Briefly , I consider giving him a damp towel to breathe through like I see people do in the movies when trapped inside a burning house . Instead , I decide to go to the window . I can sense that Guy at Table 5 is watching me , anticipating the moment when he can breathe fresh clean air again . I reach my hand over to the frame of the window as Guy at Table 5 prepares his lungs for serenity . I lean out the window to the filthy disgusting smoker who is ruining the air for my customer . <p> " Hey , Sam , how ya doing ? " Beautiful night , is n't it ?

" He coughs . <p> " Well , have a good one . Nice to see you . " <p> I walk away from the window , - leaving it just as open as it was before . I walk back to the computer and print out the check for Table 5 so its ready for them as soon as they ask for it , which will probably be any second . <p> A business news reporter with the Dallas Morning News lis ooking to connect with waiters and servers in the Dallas Fort Worth/North Texas area .

If you fit that criteria and want to help a reporter out , please contact her at krjacobs@dallasnews.com <p> Very often , people come to this blog or to the Facebook page and they are taken aback by all the negativity and bitching .

Or going to a Celine Dion website and being upset that all they do is talk about yodeling Canadians . However , in an attempt to be an all-inclusive website , I have chosen to dedicate this post to all things positive . After a few false starts , I discovered that writing about all things positive puts me in a very bad mood . Its just not in me . " What to do , what to do ? " I wondered . " I have n't always been so negative and bitchy have I ? " ( " Yes . Yes you have , " shouts my mom from 1500 miles away . ) I decided to do some digging into my boxes of crap and dig up one of my old diaries to see if I could find an entry that talked about waiting tables in a positive way . It took some time , but I found one . I give to you Non-Bitchy Waiter , circa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally psyched because today was my first day as a waiter and it was , like , totally awesome . I applied at a bunch of restaurants a couple of weeks ago and after a few interviews , I was chosen to work at Bennigans ! ! ! I started today and it was amazing . I think I am really gon na like it . I have two weeks of training which is wonderful because it will really give me a chance to learn the menu and make sure I can answer all the questions that a customer might ask . I mean " guest . " ( That 's what we call them ! ) - Its gon na be hard , but I can do it ! ! I know I can ! One thing I like about the place is that there is a jukebox and we can play our favorite music which will make it even more fun to work there . Just today , I heard Vogue , Vision of Love , Pump Up the Jam and Nothing Compares 2 U. Amazing jukebox , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage us to be ourselves and we can decorate our apron and suspenders . They call it " flair " and I am going to be the king of it ! I have so many buttons that I have been collecting for so long and now I can finally have a reason to wear them . I think i will wear a few different ones and change them every day . I have another plan about my apron . Since I am still living with Mammaw , I can use her sewing machine to make cool aprons . Maybe I can make four different ones for each of the days I work . I wonder if there is- contest for Best Flair , because I want to win it if there is ! ! Oh , and I just remembered that I heard an En Vogue song today too ! <p> The girl who trained me is super dooper nice . Her name is Melanie and I feel like we could be friends . She has worked there for nine months so she knows all the ropes . Maybe some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets paid extra to do it which would be really nice . Oh and you know what else ? I get a free meal every day ! There is a section of food off the menu we can choose from . Today I had chicken fingers ! ! FREE ! I love being a waiter . <p> As a full time professional food whore slinger of the hash , I am always willing to give a bad server the benefit of the doubt . " Maybe she 's new " or " He s probably having a bad day " are phrases that drop out of my mouth when my server forgets to bring me something or fails to make himself available . I realize that at times , even a full time professional food whore slinger of the hash , like myself , can hit some bumps in the road that keeps my service from being stellar . Just last week , I totally forgot about one of my tables because I had picked it up even though it was n't in my section . I took their order and rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chardonnay . I went to the bar to refill my coffee cup and then the bartender shared a story about how he had gone to a water park the day before . This made me think of a time I was at Blizzard Beach in Disney World . We saw this woman carrying her sleeping baby under arm as she was standing in line for a water slide . The baby looked totally out of it . " Is that baby alive ? " asked my friend Van ? " I du n no , " I replied , " but I wonder if shell let me use it as a floaty for the Lazy River because I cant find any more inner tubes . " I took a swallow of my wine so the bartender could top it off and then I went on to check on my tables completely forgetting about the one that was n't in my section . So , I know bad service sometimes happens to good people . But when it happens to me , I never know what to to tip . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brother a few days ago : <p> Coby : Help . We 've just had the worst waitress/service ever . What do I tip ? 9:21 pm <p> BW : What 's the check ? 9:21 pm <p> Coby : Getting it now . 9:22 pm <p> BW : I 'd probably still tip 15% if I thought she was trying . If she was straight up bitch , 10% or less . 9:22 pm <p> Coby : Not bitch . CLUELESS . We sat with our food in front of us for 5-7 minutes without silverware . I had to go get it . 9:27 pm <p> BW:10% . Fuck it . 9:27 pm <p> Coby : Still waiting on check . 9:29 pm <p> BW : 5%. 9:29 pm <p> Coby : Got the check . No pen . 9:33 pm <p> BW : 5% . Fuck that shit . This will be a blog post by the way . 9:33 pm <p> BW : What was the verdict ? 10:45 pm <p> Coby : Gave her 5 on 48. 11:02 pm <p> Was my advice wrong ? What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect the bar to be raised a little bit since we all do it for a living , but if someone is woefully inadequate at their job , its hard to tip them the same as I would for someone who was spectacular . I always start at 20% and go from there . To get less than that , you kinda have to go out of your way . Even for bad service , I will give 15% . But my brother gave 10% and I stand behind it . He asked for the check at 9:22 and did not get it until 9:33 . Does it really take eleven minutes to hit " print " on a computer and drop a check ? If you 're that far behind , you can always ask someone to drop the check for you . And to sit for over five minutes with hot food in front of you and no silverware is unacceptable . Why wasnt there silver there when they were sat ? - If the food is overcooked and the server fixes the situation there is no reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like it was all the responsibility of the server . This waitress was lucky to get the 10% . <p> What do you do when you have extraordinarily bad service in a restaurant ? Do you still tip well ? Or do you tip less than you normally would but explain why ? And if you explain your actions , how do you do it ? A note on the check or a discussion with the manager ? Discuss , please . <p> The following blog post should be read out loud in the voice of one of those private eyes that you would see in a 1940s movie about seedy Los Angeles . Imagine that it is being read by a man wearing a trench coat and a fedora leaning against a lamp post while smoking a cigarette . It is dusk and a shadow covers most of his face . <p> It was a slow night at the restaurant . The cooks were reading newspapers , the servers were sharing an order of fries and the customers were eating anyplace but there . The Bitchy Waiter needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his opening sidework was already done . The last thing that needed to happen was placing the candles in the restrooms . One of them had been locked so he put the lit candle on a shelf and waited for whichever employee was inside to come out . Erika , the new chef , emerged from the restroom and he took the candle inside . He noticed the toilet still had paper in it . " Geez , flush the fucking toilet , new girl , " he thought . Hanging on the wall was an empty roll of toilet paper and sitting on the tank was a brand new roll that had been unwrapped but she must have been too lazy to throw away the empty roll and replace it with a new one . Thirty minutes had passed and now he was bored . He looked at the pile of silverware that needed to be rolled and then his eyes fell onto the empty ketchup bottle but nether one of those were going to make him feel constructive . <p> " Maybe I 'll go make a phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidestand ; the same mirror that was in need of a date with some Windex . He reached up to the shelf and picked up his cell phone ; the same cell phone that was strictly prohibited on the dining room floor . He headed straight to the restroom where the air was n't fresh but the silence was golden . He swung the door open , flipped the light on and stepped inside . <p> " Goddammit ! " Looking down , his skid-resistant shoes were in an inch of water . The toilet was running and the bowl was overflowing with water . Toilet paper was spinning in a lazy clockwise pattern and enjoying its freedom from the bowels of sewage and grasping at its chance to see what life is like on the floor . " Who the fuck clogged the fucking toilet bowl ? " <p> The Bitchy Waiter shoved his cell phone into his pocket and went to tell the manager . " The restroom needs some attention . Bad . " He watched his manager scurry over to Jose the dishwasher and the two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ? " asked the bartender ? <p> " The toilet overflowed and now my shoes are all fucking disgusting . " <p> " Who the fuck ? I bet it was table 16 . " We looked over at the lone table in the restaurant . Sitting at the booth was an older man who had only moments before returned from visiting one of the two restrooms . " He looks like he could clog a toilet real good . " <p> " Uh huh , " said The Bitchy Waiter as he eyed Erika slicing some carrots . " Maybe it was him . Maybe not . " <p> The manager reappeared rolling behind him a big yellow mop bucket and holding a dirty mop that no doubt now had traces of fecal matter that would be spread all over the restaurant the next day unless someone changed the mop head . But no one ever changed the mop head . <p> " Its okay now , " the manager said . " Someone tried to flush the toiler paper wrapper but I plunged it . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mop head . <p> The bartender looked at table 16 again . " It was totally that guy , right ? " <p> " I do n't  think so , " said The Bitchy Waiter . " Someone else was in there first and that someone else is now slicing carrots . " <p> " Well , I went in there right after she came out and I noticed the toilet wasnt flushed . She had finished a roll of toilet paper and opened a new one . The boss said that whoever it was tried to flush the toilet paper wrapping and that 's what made it overflow . So yeah . I think it was her . That bitch took a huge fucking dump , clogged the toilet and now she 's making a salad . " <p> They both looked over at Erika who was using her hands to mix some Caesar dressing into a bowl of romaine lettuce . <p> The bartender shuddered . Okay , now I am totally grossed out by her and I thought she was kinda cool . " <p> The Bitchy Waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clog the toilet at least try to fix it yourself . I mean the plunger is right there , but she 's just gon na act like nothin happened ? That is some nasty shit , man . " <p> " Well , maybe it was the guy at 16 , who knows ? He could have gone in after her and when he tried to flush the toilet , it overflowed . " <p> " Yeah , maybe . But I 'm gon na just go with it being her . I read a lot of Encyclopedia Brown books when I was a kid and I 'm pretty good at figuring out mysteries . The clues point to her . " <p> " Caesar salad is up for 16 , " yelled Erika . <p> The Bitchy Waiter went to the line and picked up the salad . " Thanks , " he said . <p> " No problem , " she replied . " Looks like its gon na be a slow night , huh ? " <p> " Maybe . You never can tell . Sometimes you think its gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant is overflowing and in a flush you 're busy . " <p> " What ? she asked . <p> " I meant flash . Thanks for the salad . " <p> The Bitchy Waiter dropped the Caesar salad at table 16 and went into the other restroom to make his phone call . His night was just beginning . <p> On my birthday , I like to do things that involve people who care about me . I surround myself with my husband and good friends like Marlene , Scott and Svedka . These are the people who I think do n't  mind singing the Happy Birthday Song to me and then when its their birthday I return the favor . Its what people do . <p> You know who does not want to sing the Happy Birthday Song to you ? Your server , that 's who . A reader sent me a little story about what went down in her section a couple of weeks ago . I am not going to give his name because I do n't  want to take the chance that the is violating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : at his corporate restaurant , they banned singing happy birthday because of a lawsuit involving harassment . He did n't  give me the details but I assume it went something like , " Oh my God , these bitches caint sing at all and they are ruining my Awesome Blossom eatin time . Harassment ! " Anyhoo , the servers at his restaurant are exempt from the hell that is known as " I need birthday singers . " A lady came into the restaurant with her little girl and asked that they sing for her birthday . The server said they cant do it , but gave her a free dessert anyway . The lady talked to the manager who confirmed that it was not gon na happen . The lady then got all pissed off and stiffed the server on a $32 bill and left this note which I Photoshopped a little bit so you cant see what restaurant it came from : <p> Crappy birthday ! <p> " We wanted to give a better tip but felt no accommodations were given or consideration for the childs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no candle or any type of celebration was done . We are kinda disappointed ! " <p> You know what , Mom ? Get the fuck over it . If its the restaurants policy to not sing the goddamn stupid ass happy fucking birthday song , then that 's how it goes . Eat your free piece of thawed out birthday cake and move on . And what kind of life are you living if your daughters idea of a great birthday is to go to some chain restaurant that 's in the parking lot of a mall ? When I was a kid , I celebrated my birthday in my back yard with my friends . My mom and dad would buy a sheet cake from Albertsons and make some Kool-Aid and then all the kids from the neighborhood would come over and wed play on the swing set . At some point , we 'd sit at a big table and I would let them all serenade me until I was given the cue to to rip open my presents . That 's what a kids birthday should be like . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ruined . " Well , honey , if my birthday passed without a bunch people I do n't  know begrudgingly singing Happy Birthday to me off-key , I 'd call that a rip-roaring success . And you 're mad because they did n't  put a candle in the cake ? They did n't  have any fucking candles . Do you want your server to pull one out of her ass ? Or how about they just put a chopstick in it and light it on fire ? Or a Bic lighter ? Would that have made her " special day " any better ? And then you 're not going to leave a tip ? Why in the hell does the server have to pay the price for a corporate policy ? If you 're unhappy with the policy at a restaurant , do what every other disappointed customer does these days : go to Yelp and write a review about it and then go to their Facebook page and complain until they send you a fucking coupon for a free Apple Chimicheesecake and 10% off your next visit . <p> And to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next time your mom wants to take you somewhere for your big day , choose someplace where she 's gon na have to dig a little deeper into her pockets . You 're worth more than $32 ( and that was for two adults and two children , by the way . ) When you are older and look back on this day of disappointment , you will realize that not having the servers sing to you was a blessing in disguise . When I worked at Houlihans in Times Square , we were all singers . Before and after work , all of us were auditioning for Broadway shows . We could sing , like really sing , but when someone asked us to sing to them for their birthday , we would choose five different keys and and turn the volume to " shut the hell up . " It was not pretty . It was just our way to make that special day as memorable as possible . Hopefully next year , your mom can take you to Chuck E. Cheese or better yet , she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you can be surrounded by people who actually care about you and will want to sing Happy Birthday to you . <p> Okay , Im done .

She was originally introduced to the blog back in June of 2010 when someone suggested I grow up , have a family and write about things that really matter . -BW <p> Well , hello everyone . My goodness , is it 2013 already ? I could hardly believe my eyes when I looked at the calendar this morning and saw it is January 3 ! ! LOL . With the holidays , the last few weeks just flew by . I have practically been chained to my oven as of late , what with Thanksgiving and then cooking for all the office parties Hubby was going to . I was in charge of the holiday bake sale at the kids school and then all of a sudden it was Christmas . I spent four days preparing for that feast . Goose , ham , roast beef and a turkey ! ! LOL ! I wanted to make everyones favorite . Hubby brought a nice young lady from the office to dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was so sweet of him to offer . The poor thing ca n't be a day over 22 years old and she had no one to share her holidays with so Hubby , being the generous spirit that he is , brought her home with him . Such a dear . She even spent the night which at first I thought was odd , but it seemed so wrong for anyone to spend the holiday alone . Hubby must have gotten up to check on her three or four times that night too , the poor dear . He was so worried that she would n't be able to sleep . He was in her room once for 45 minutes as he read her The Night Before Christmas . Such a sweet man . <p> Christmas Day was wonderful . Suzy and Billy tore threw their presents as usual and loved all of them . I got Hubby a beautiful new neck tie , a sweater , a wallet , some cologne , socks , a new belt , a new coffee maker and some golf clubs and he was thrilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new vacuum cleaner ! But not just any vacuum cleaner-this one has a light on it ! So futuristic . I feel like Jane Jetson when using it . LOL ! ! He even went to get Lola a last minute gift to open so she would n't feel awkward watching us open all of our presents . Since it was such a last minute decision , the only thing he could find her was a negligee , but she seemed to like it ! ! She even tried it on and Hubby took a couple of pictures of her . It was adorable . <p> And then New Years Eve ! Oh my stars , it was absolutely crazy . We had a party ! So if course , I did all the cooking for that since Hubby was busy at work . He s training Lola to become a better secretary so he is with her for hours on end . ( Do n't  work too hard , dear ! I need you at home too , LOL ! ) We had about 45 guests at the party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate was already full , no pun intended ! ! ! Curiously , all the party-goers were women who 's husbands and boyfriends were sick . That 's right , our house was full of girls ! Poor hubby was the only man that night . I felt sorry for him trying to a good host and not having any men to talk to about sports . But he did a great job . He mingled all night and everyone seemed to love him . ( But not as much as me ! ! ! ) <p> He did the funniest thing ! You know the Christmas tradition of kissing under the mistletoe , right ? Well Hubby thought it would be fun to do that even though it was well past Christmas . He s so crazy ! ! ! And of course we did n't  have any mistletoe so I fashioned some out of a some parsley which I sprayed with glitter paint and then wrapped with a piece of red ribbon from Suzys hair ribbon box . He called it " faux mistletoe " and then he started calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I swear , he must have kissed every women there at least twice , Such a giver to make sure all these women were getting some attention since their significant others were all at home with the flu . <p> The day after the party , Hubby slept all day as I cleaned up . He was exhausted from being such a good party host . I had one glass of champagne at the party and boy oh boy did I pay for that the ext day ! ! But like a good soldier , I got the house clean and made dinner just in time for Hubby to wake up . He had dinner for breakfast , LOL ! ! <p> And now it is January 3rd and time for my resolutions : <p> be a better couponer . <p> cook with more natural ingredients and stop being so lazy by using Bisquick . <p> try to be more social . <p> improve my Bridge game . <p> be more understanding when Hubby has to go out of town to work on the weekends with his secretary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season of Desperate Housewives . <p> mop three times a week instead of just two . <p> pay more attention to my make up and stop getting it all over Hubbys shirts . <p> realize that Hubby needs his space and if he wants to sleep in the extra bedroom every other night , that is his choice and I should stop wondering why he takes the laptop in there and when it comes out the history has been erased . <p> tell my husband every day how lucky I am to have him in my life ! ! ! ! <p> Happy new year , everyone . 109839 @qwx969839 <h> Now read one of these lame-ass posts : <p> LONG ... But Happy Stay-At-Home LONG ... LONG ... 10 Nov 2011 20:39:00 LONG ... gracious , it has been so long since I have had time to write . Halloween took so much out of me and all of a sudden Turkey Day is almost here ! The kids were adorable in their costumes ; Billy was a hobo and Suzy was a gypsy . I even put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was soooo into it ! Hubby had to work late that night because he was training a new secretary but I took lots of pictures so it was almost like he was there , LOL . <p> Anyway , let me get to the point . I recently saw a horrible blog written by what appears to be a very unhappy middle-aged man who has spent his years waiting tables . I cant even say the name of his blog , because it has a bad word in it . Poor thing . He must be miserable . He wrote a post about a woman who came into his restaurant and breastfed . Boy oh boy , did he stir up the pot with that one . I do n't  usually like to face conflict , but I want to put in my two cents . Okay , maybe three cents , LOL ! <p> Breastfeeding is my right as a mother , a woman and an American . Its even protected by the law in most states and if its the law then we know it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of America after all . I breastfed both of my darlings and if I still could , I would . It is a special bond and I miss it . The last time I breastfed Billy we were at Chuck E. Cheeses for his birthday . I knew that he was soon going to be too old to have that moment with me and when I saw him blowing out his five candles , I could n't resist . I pulled out my feeding apron and put him in my lap . Of course he did n't  want to , what with all his friends there watching , but I just told him how much better his birthday cake would taste if he had it with some milk first . After I promised him a dollar to go play Skee-Ball , he agreed and took one last sip . I asked Suzy if she wanted some but she was texting on her phone and said , " No thanks , Mom . I 'm busy . " They grow up so fast ! ! ! <p> If that B****y Waiter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . That 's what all the people at Chuck E. Cheese did . Honestly , it was if theyd never seen a woman feed her five-year old child before . Even some of the mothers seemed put off by it which I found really surprising , but if they ca n't handle it , that 's their issue and not mine . Breasts are made for one thing : FEEDING CHILDREN . ( Hubby , if you 're reading this , I know you beg to differ , you naughty boy , but its true . It really is true , dear , no matter what you try to show me on your videos . ) I am not ashamed when I feed . When I go to the beach or the swimming pool , I wear my one-piece with the cute little skirt and the polka-dot cover up , but when it comes time to feed my children , if some skin shows , then so be it . I am woman , hear me roar . Or in the case of last Halloween , hear me " meow . " LOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write and let B****y Waiter know that breastfeeding is a wonderful and natural thing that women do . Its a privilege and an honor . I hope he can come to turns with it and maybe someday he wo n't find a bosom so disturbing . Once he falls in love with the right girl and becomes a father , he will understand how truly wonderful it is to feed a child by the nipple of his wife . I pray for him . I hope he can find happiness someday . <p> Farewell , all . I am off to the grocery store to get things for dinner . Hubby said he will be home for dinner tonight so I am making his favorite : meatloaf and green peas with fresh rolls . Of course , there is always the chance that he will have to work late again or even spend the night at the office . The poor dear works tirelessly when it comes to training his secretary but he loves it so who am I to judge ? I love you Hubby ! ! ! Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything right eventually . You just keep trying even if it takes all week , you sweet dedicated man , you . 109839 @qwx969839 <h> Now read one of these lame-ass posts : <p> LONG ... Mothers LONG ... LONG ... 08 May 2011 20:00:00 LONG ... Mothers Day to you all . My gift to you is this repeat post ; a repeat because I will be at work serving brunch all day . The only mimosas I will today see are the ones that will be sitting on my tray . This is the original Frazzled But Happy Stay-at-Home Mom post and it seemed appropriate for the day . If you 're a mom , have a great day ! If you 're not a mom , be happy that you do n't  have to spend the day with a bunch of kids . I 'm not a mom , but my next five hours I will be surrounded by children and strollers . Wish me luck . I hate serving brunch on mothers day <p> Oh my stars , you wo n't believe the day I had today , dear blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coffee . That 's right ! My husband got up before me and made coffee and its not even Mothers Day ! ( But our anniversary is coming up if a certain someone is reading this . Hee hee ! LOL ! ) I went into the kitchen and saw my darling hubby drinking his coffee and reading the newspaper over the sink . He told me he could n't sleep and that 's why he had already gotten up and made coffee . Oh well , I thought it was for me . But he s still the bestest husband in the whole world . LOL ! ! . He went off to work and I set about my day . <p> I went to wake up Suzy Lou and she looked so cute in her Strawberry Shortcake sheets that I did n't  have the heart to wake her up . She was wrapped up like a mummy and I almost laughed so hard that it would have woken her up . Lucky for me , she sleeps like a log so she did n't  hear me . LOL ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as soon as I get a chance . I went to wake up her brother Billy Boo . The little angel had thrown his Thomas the Tank blanket off the bed and he was n't covered up at all . My goodness , I hope he was n't cold last night . ( Reminder to self : set the alarm for the middle of the night to make sure he is still covered up . ) He woke up and rubbed his little eyes and asked me if he could have pancakes . And guess what ! I could n't resist ! So even though today was bacon and egg day , I made him pancakes . A mothers work is never done , LOL . I still made Suzy Lou her scrambled egg whites and crispy bacon so my morning routine was a little off . It really threw me in a tizzy to be so off schedule but sometimes we moms just have to let the kids know how special they are and be wild and crazy . Its these special memories that make being a stay-at-home mom such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LOL ! ! <p> The kids had a play date today and their friends Peter , Paul and Mary came over . Their mom Jenny is a doll and we love that our kids enjoy each other so much . Plus when Jenny comes over we will split a glass of White Zinfandel so we moms have our own " play date " too . Shhh ! Do n't  tell my husband that I was drinking on the job . He might fire me ! ! LOL ! Just kidding . He would never fire me for that . As long as I have dinner on the table when he gets home from work , he is happy . Besides , I know he reads this anyway . ( Hi honey ! I wuv you ! ) <p> After the play date was over , I put the kids down for a nap . I read them a story first and Billy Boo did the cutest thing . He wanted to read the story to me ! ! Can you believe it ? So he took the book and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I videotaped the whole thing and I will be posting it soon so you can see for yourself how precious it was . And Suzy Lou played along and pretended that he was reading too . She is such a good big sister , is n't she ? ? Hugs to her . I LOVE MY KIDS ! ! <p> I spent the rest of the day doing my usual routine . Laundry , dusting , sewing , gardening , and then I capped it off with churning some homemade butter . That class I took at the Learning Annex on turn of the century homemaking is really paying off ! My husband will be so pleased when he gets home and sees that yummy butter on the table ! Maybe tonight we will finish off that White Zinfandel and have our own romantic evening . ( hee hee ! ) After the dishes are washed and the kids are in bed of course . <p> And there you have my day , dear bloggers . I have the best life in the world . The most perfect family ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really matters . <p> love , <p> The Frazzled but Happy Stay-at-Home Mom 109837 @qwx969837 <h> Now read one of these lame-ass posts : <p> LONG ...

I guess with all the craziness of the holidays , time has just flown by and here it is already the middle of January . But Spring is only a few weeks away , LOL ! ! When I last wrote , it was all about my Turkey Day and what a gobble gobble joy it was . But Christmas came and went and it was filled with so much joy and love that my face hurt from smiling for so many days . Of course the kiddos loved it and hubby bought me a new vacuum cleaner ! ( You were listening , dearest darling husband that I love oh so much ! ) I spent all day on the 26th of December vacuuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drapes and upholstery too . It was so much fun ! I wanted the house to be clean clean clean for our New Years Eve party . Can you believe we had a party ? I decided to have a celebration since my baby brother was in town for the holidays . He is such a dear . His name is Bryan and he works in a restaurant . The kids were so excited to see their favorite uncle . I must admit that I was surprised that Bryan left his home so near Christmas because he loves that holiday so much . ( Remind me to post pictures of his Department 56 Original Snow Village sometime . Its amazing . ) But his new roommate Sam had a business trip in a neighboring town and they decided to visit us as well . We only have one guest bedroom , but Bryan said that he did n't  mind sharing the room with Sam . I felt awful that one of them had to sleep on the floor but they seemed okay with it . I think they must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the room . That floor must have been so hard ! Or maybe it was their little schnauzer , Tranny , that was howling , I ca n't be sure . Anyhoo , the next day they seemed refreshed and happy so I guess it was n't too crowded in there for the three of them . <p> Bryan told the kids that they could call Sam " Uncle Sam " which made me laugh . Uncle Sam ! Isnt that funny ? That brother of mine is so sweet and he brought presents for the kids too . He gave Suzy Loo a limited edition vintage Barbie doll and Billy Boo a limited edition Ken doll . I told him he spent too much money , but he assured me that they just came from his personal collection and he was trying to make room in his home since Sam moved in . ( It must be crowded over there too , because he only has a one bedroom apartment . Sam must have to sleep on the couch , poor thing . ) <p> Our party was a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bryan , Sam and hubbys secretary . Since we do n't  normally stay up very late , we celebrated Londons New Year which was five hours earlier than ours . That way I could still be in bed by 9:00 . I had two glasses of sparkling apple cider and I do n't  care what the bottle says , I swear to goodness that I was bit tipsy ! When I went to bed with the kids , Hubby was driving his secretary home and Bryan and his roommate were going to another party they heard about that was happening in an abandoned warehouse down by the piers . <p> The next morning I shook off my apple cider hangover and was surprised to see none of them were home yet . Looks like 2011 was off to a bad start . Hubby got a flat tire and had to spend the night at his secretarys house . Bryan and Sam eventually made it home via a nice man they met named Meat . They said they drank too many Cosmos and Meat took care of them all night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they come up with these names for housing complexes these days ? ) They both seemed exhausted and the poor dears could barely stand up straight . If I did n't  know any better I d think they had been horseback riding all night long because they were both a little bowlegged . They must have really danced last night ! They borrowed $200 dollars from my cookie jar to thank Meat for his services ( I guess Meat towed their car home for them ) and he went on his way . <h> Now read one of these lame-ass posts : <p> LONG ...

Is it just me or does Thanksgiving sap away your energy too ? I got up on Turkey Day ( gobble gobble ) at 4:00 AM because I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I made a turkey but I also baked a ham , made a pot roast and created my first ever Tofurkey Meatloaf because we had so many people come over and I wanted everyone to have their choice of food to give thanks over . Of course my husband was there and the kiddos , but we also had 12 guests . That made for 16 people . Whew ! We were going to have my parents over as well as my sister and her family but my sweet husband had the best idea ever . He wanted to have something called an " Orphan Thanksgiving " which shows you how caring and sweet that darling precious man of mine is . An Orphan Thanksgiving is when you extend an invitiation to anyone else who may not have someplace else to go for Thanksgiving . Not actual orphans I suppose , but just people who do n't  have any family nearby . Since we have place settings for 16 , we decided that we could invite a dozen people . I was going to invite the homeless man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet husband filled up those slots so quickly that I had to rescind my invite to Wally the Window Washer . I also wanted to invite our neighbor who lost her husband three weeks ago , but Hubby was insistent that his guests were more in need . So his guest list is what we had . <p> All twelve of the young girls he invited were so sweet . Various women from his job and his volunteer work and they were all very gracious . Dinner was set for 3:00 , so from the time I got up , I had eleven hours to get everything ready . It was a challenge , because two of the girls had a gluten allergy , four were vegetarian one was vegan and eleven of them were " watching their weight . " One girl was fine with anything I served and seemed a bit depressed the whole day . I noticed that she kept giving my hubby an odd look , so she must be very sad that she ca n't be with her family at this time of year . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their figure because all of them were about a size 2 and pretty as a picture . They all loved my cooking . And you know how they say that the tryptophan in turkey makes you sleepy ? It does ! Within minutes of finishing dinner , all of the girls needed a nap right away . Some of them had n't  even had turkey so it must have been contagious , LOL . They all went down to the basement into my husbands office for a nap and hubby even joined them while I cleaned up the dishes . ( I do wish he would give me a key to his office so I could clean it once in a while . Who knows how much dust is in there and I cant believe the company might think I 'm not a good housekeeper ! ) The 13 of them stayed in there for two and a half hours sleeping off dinner . One girl came up to get some Gatorade because she said the Tofurkey meatloaf made her thirsty , but she hurried right back in as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely naive , let me say something : I know they werent sleeping in there . I heard one of them say something about new underwear so I am pretty sure that my husband was enlisting their help for my Christmas present . He knows that the best way to find out what a woman wants for a gift is to ask another woman , so I let him stay in there and devise the perfect plan for his Christmas shopping . Last year , the poor dear was so busy with work , he only had time to make me a handmade gift certificate good for one free kiss whenever I wanted it . ( I still have it , Hubby . LOL ! ! ) <p> Well , readers , I must go . I did all my Christmas shopping yesterday and I am ready to start wrapping gifts . I love the holidays almost as much as I love my Hubby and kids .

At first they wanted to just go to the Wal-Mart and buy their costumes . Billy wanted to be something called Iron Man and Suzy wanted to be a Pussy Cat Doll , but after some persuading they finally agreed that my ideas are much better . Cuter for sure , LOL . <p> Well , I must be going . Its Saturday and I have n't even baked my bread , ironed my sheets , waxed the floor or clipped my coupons yet .

Instead , the rats are looking at me like , " Why the fuck are you up so early , lazy ass ? " No , I am not serving breakfast or still up from my night of drinking . Alarm goes off at seven and you start uptown . You put in your eight hours for the powers that have always been . Till its five P.M.

She would be done with her day by 11:30 and come home with a fist full of dollars , take a nap and be good to go . I never could do that . Morning people are just as foreign to me as those who have children . I know they exist but I cant wrap my brain around how they do it .

My aunt is a morning person who wakes up before the sun has even thought about rising and has a cup of coffee and does the crossword puzzle and then will have all her household chores done before 9:00 AM . The downside of being a morning person is these people have to go to bed early to do it . Do they know what wonders they are missing that only happen after 10:00 PM ? Like the news , or Jimmy Kimmel , or House Hunters International on HGTV ? <p> My point is , today I am a morning person . Since I do n't  drink coffee , anyone who sits next to me on the 7 train better watch out . My grump could accidentally spill over onto them and cause second and third degree burns .

I honestly envy morning people ( because for some odd reason being a night owl is highly frowned upon ) and hate them at the same time because they are annoying as fuck . The problem is this abusive society we live in . I blame the employers . No one , and I mean no one 's day should begin before 10:00am if you 're in a corporate setting .

I was stiffed last night on a $75 check but I think it really was unintentional because the man who did it is a regular who always seems half a step away from complete and utter dumb fuck . <p> As per the norm , I sweep the room and drop checks as soon as the show is over . I then sweep back and pick up any checks that are ready to be paid , run the cards or make change and then go back to my section to return those checks and pick up the next round . The man at booth four last night watched me walk by twice without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood at the bar swiping the credit cards of the four tables who did manage to hand me payment , Mr. Village Idiot wandered into the lobby with his check in his hands and asked nobody in particular , " Who do I give this to ? " The man was not the brightest bulb . The lights were on but nobody was home . He was hit in the head with the stupid stick . Now , I ask you , is it that hard to figure out who to pay ? There were only two servers , I was the only one who dealt with him and I was also the one who gave him his check and said " I 'll pick that up whenever you 're ready . " To me , it seems pretty obvious , but then again my brain is not the consistency of mashed green peas mixed with bottom shelf scotch . ( Truth be told , my brain is the consistency of refried beans and bottom shelf tequila , but whatever ) Enrique the bartender says , " Sir , we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is right here . " Old Foggy Forgetful handed me his credit card and I told him I would take care of right it after I get through the stack of checks of people who did not stumble to the bar like lost lambs who just had lobotomies . He was put out by the fact that he was going to have to wait so I realized he was just playing dumb because he thought it would get him out faster . I took his credit card and put it at the bottom of the stack . " Itll be right here on the bar when Im done with it . " He told me he was going to go say hello to someone and would be right back . I very quickly got to his card and placed it on the bar for him to sign when he was ready . Fifteen minutes later , the card and unsigned slip was right where I had left it . Absent Minded Nutty Ass Professor was nowhere to be found . Perhaps the person he wanted to say hello to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its more likely that he saw something shiny on the sidewalk and went out to chase it . <p> After about ten more minutes , it was clear that he was not coming back . Maybe the shiny object he saw was the taillight of a taxi and he was now lying face down on Sixth Avenue and wondering why he suddenly had a perfect view of the back of his own ass . I had no other choice but to close the check without a tip and accept that I was getting stiffed on his $75 bill . Less than moral servers would add a tip but credit card fraud is not on my bucket list so I was willing to eat the loss . A message was left for Shit For Brains on his voice mail telling him that he could come pick up his credit card at his earliest convenience . Hell probably show up today and act all embarrassed and ashamed but you can be certain that he wo n't leave the tip . That would just be too kind . And we all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mushy green pea brains mixed with cheap scotch will do anything to save themselves seven dollars and fifty cents . ( You just know that he was going to leave 10% , right ? ) The next time he sits in my station , I will make sure to give him his check right away and I wont leave until I see him scrawl out his signature ( in the form on an X , no doubt ) on his credit card slip . There still probably wont be a tip but I can deal with that . If he can accept that his brain is smoother than the humus on our menu , I can accept that he cant understand that I live on tips . I just hope he does n't  mind that the bottom shelf scotch on the rocks he orders might be in a smaller glass with a shitload of ice and a little bit of water that went over my thumb on the way into the glass . <p> We food-slingers work for tips and its no secret that we depend on them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right there before you say some stupid ass shit like " get a real job " or " tipping is optional . " For whatever reason , we wait tables . And for whatever reason , in this country tipping is expected . End of story . When we look at a credit card voucher to see what our tip is , there are many scenarios that can make it confusing for us . ( And Anonymous , its not confusing because servers are stupid . Its confusing because too many people do n't  understand how to fill out a freakin credit card slip . Zip it . ) <p> How many times have you gotten a voucher where they just scribble in a total without bothering to write how much the tip is ? You know what I mean ? Say their bill is $72.23 and they do n't  bother writing a tip in . They just put $100 in the final line . Not a huge deal , but it means that I have to pull out my third grade math skills and subtract subtract $72.23 from $100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer for my tip . ( Its $27.77 , Anonymous . I 'm not stupid . ) Its just an extra step that I have to take and it can suck when you are looking at a pile of 40 vouchers that have to be closed . <p> Another irritating thing is when people write the tip in clearly and the total in clearly , but the the two do n't  add up . Then I have to decide which one do I accept as correct . For instance : the bill is $40 and they write as the tip $8 but then they total it as $50 . What to do ? If I put in $8 for the tip , then the total will differ from their copy and wreak havoc when they try to balance their checkbook . So I go with the $50 total and assume they meant to give me a ten dollar tip . However , if the bill was $40 , they wrote in $10 for the tip and they total it as $48 , I will have to take the ten dollar tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the most . If there is a problem ( and there never has been ) all I have to do is show that the ten dollars was very clearly written . <p> Finally , I fucking hate it when people just scribble random numbers in various spaces that do n't  mean shit and I have to pull out the goddamn Rosetta Stone to decipher what the hell they meant . Sometimes we just have to hope for the best and guess at what the tip was meant to be . That can be dangerous though because you do n't  want to be all guilty of credit card fraud and shit . This woman was just arrested for adding $953.19 in credit card tips between February 3 and March 12 of this year . That 's almost two hundred bucks a week . That silly goose must have been adding zeros left and right and she thought no one would notice that shit ? Uh , honey . If someone meant to tip $13.28 and you try to close it out as $132.80 cents , they 're gon na notice . Dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , she worked at Outback Steakhouse . Hopefully , the judge wont throw her ass in jail and will just tell her she has to work an extra shift every week for two years . I would imagine serving Bloomin Onions all day is a prison all its own . <p> We have all had people who have tried to skip out on their check and the occasional walk out who actually succeeds at getting a meal without paying for it . It happens rarely even though it seems like it would happen more often . A few days ago , I encountered a man who was either trying to skip out on his bill or he was incredibly forgetful . Either way , he got on my nerves and as I was trying to fix the situation a thought popped into my head : at least I have something to write about . <p> At my job , we place all the checks down at the same time immediately after the show is over . Therefore , we have to make change for everyone at once and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables all throwing credit cards and cash at you at the same time . Table six had a pile of money on the check presenter and when they told me they did n't  need any change , it went to the bottom of the stack since I was finished with them . About ten minutes later when I started closing checks , I came across their $129 check and saw that the pile of money was only twenty dollars . Hold up now , wait , what ? Frantically , I hurried around the club to see if they were still there so I could squeeze out the remaining $109 ( plus tip ) from their pocketbooks . At first they were nowhere to be found . Fuck , I had let them leave without double checking their total ? What am I , a hack ? An amateur ? I ran downstairs and then back upstairs looking like a chicken with his head cut off who did n't  want to have to cover $109 . Then , I spotted one of them up at the front of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the man . " Excuse me , but I just wanted to make sure of something . You said you did n't  need change right ? " " That 's right , " he said . I looked down at the twenty dollars and then looked back at him with a " so what the hell ? " expression . " That 's your tip , " he said . " I gave you my credit card , remember ? " I was really busy so I though maybe he did and I had forgotten . Or maybe he gave it to someone else and he thought it was me . " Oh , alright then . Well , I do n't  have the signed voucher , maybe you took both of them by accident ? " He looked confused . I went to the computer and pulled up his check and there was no credit card info on it meaning it was not swiped by me or anyone else . I went back to the potential scammer . <p> ME : Can I see your credit voucher just to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HIM : I du n no if I have it.Well , can you look ? ME : Did you give me your credit card ? HIM : Yeah , and then you handed it right back to me.Without going to swipe it ? Why the fuck would I do that ? ME : Are you sure you gave it to me ? HIM : I think so.ME : And you do n't  know if you have the copy that you signed ? HIM : Uh , I du n no . I do n't  remember.Okay , it was like ten minutes ago and he does n't  remember ? Is he playing dumb ? He seemed too young to be in the early stages of dementia . And I must ask , if one is in the early stages of dementia , how long does it take to be fully demented ? ( Stole that line from Naked in a Fishbowl ) . HIM : You can swipe my card again if you need to , just make sure I do n't  get charged twice.Listen buddy , I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you once . <p> I took him to my computer and showed him the check . I showed him how there was no credit card info on it and then after I swiped it there was meaning this was the first time it had been swiped . He shrugged his shoulders and said " Okay , if you say so . " I do say so , ass . You did n't  pay . Maybe you forgot or maybe you were trying to be slick , but you did n't  pay and I caught your ass . I do think it was an honest mistake , because if he was trying to skip out , he would have left immediately . But what irked me was that he was acting like I was the one doing something shady . In the end , he paid his check , left me a decent tip and was nice about it , but I do n't  really get it . Can someone really forget something that quickly ? Maybe he was so wrapped up in my attentive and stellar service that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . 109837 @qwx969837 <p> I recently wrote about how frustrating it is when someone takes both copies of the credit card slip effectively keeping me from getting a tip because I do n't  know what they had written on the tip line . It really sucks when this happens , but a few days ago a miracle occurred . Let 's play a game and you decide which miracle is true . <p> Miracle #1 : I woke up late and was rushing around getting ready to start my day . I was out of Cheerios so I had to go to breakfast option number two which would be two pieces of toast with grape jam . I put my bread in the toaster and two minutes later I sat down with my breakfast ready to eat . All of a sudden , I noticed an image peering back at me from my multi-grain bread . Jesus had appeared on my breakfast food . I quickly took a picture and sold that shit on Ebay for $23.99 . Its miracle ! <p> Miracle #2 : In my backyard , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I go to her and thank her for watching over me and keeping me safe . I talk to her and explain my day and when I am done I feel better . Well , one day as I was telling her how thankful I was for the ten percent tip that someone left me on a $100 check , I looked into her eyes and saw that she was crying . The Virgin Mary statue was crying real tears and I knew that I was on the path to righteousness . Its a miracle ! <p> Miracle #3 : A few days ago , someone came into the club and told me that they had inadvertently took the credit card slip that had my tip on it and they owed me twenty dollars . Its a miracle ! <p> Can you figure out which one really happened ? I 'll give you two clues . Never am I out of Cheerios and I do not have a backyard . Uh huh . Someone actually came back in to tip me from the week before . It made my night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made all things right in the world . Like Anne Frank , " in spite of everything , I still believe that people are really good at heart . " Until someone asks me for a glass of water , a bowl of lemons and Sweet and Low packets and then I go right back to hating all people .

But now that has changed . A guy named Adam left his resignation letter to Taco Bell in a very creative way . He did n't  write it on a bev nap as I did to excuse myself from Houlihans . He did n't  email it . He did n't  Fed Ex it . In fact , he really did n't  even write a letter . He put it on the sign in front of the restaurant ( like Taco Bell is a restaurant ) so instead of customers seeing " Gorditas for $1.99 " they saw a big ol " I Quit , Fuck You . " He followed that with a smiley face so it was n't completely rude . It was said that he had worked 22 days in a row and was denied having off for the Fourth of July . Right there with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birth of your country . It must be because they are a Mexican " restaurant . " If you 'd have asked off for Cinco de Mayo or Mexican Independence Day , it would have been no big deal . They would have done it and given you a free side of guacamole too . But the Fourth of July ? No way , Jose . Lo siento in a big way , but get your ass back in the kitchen and make me a chalupa . <p> None of us were there , so we can only imagine what went down when he asked for the day off . <p> Adam : Hey , manager , can I like have the fourth of July off ? <p> Manager : No . <p> Adam : Dude , cmon . Ive been working for like 22 days in a row . That 's like two and half weeks , what the fuck ? <p> Manager : Do not use that language in our establishment . I will give you a demerit and put it in your permanent record . <p> Adam : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Labor Day ? Then can I be off on the fourth ? My friends are having this totally awesome pool party and I told them that I would bring the tacos . <p> Manager : No . Go clean the bathrooms , Adam . <p> Adam : No way , man . Its totally not my turn to clean the bathrooms . Let that new chick with the mustache do it . I 'd rather clean out the grease trap or mop the walk-in . <p> Manager : Do I sense insubordination ? <p> Adam : Dude , like I even know what that is . So seriously can I have off on the fourth of July ? <p> Managaer : No , now go count the tortillas . And because I am sensing some attitude from you , I am going to take away your break today and your Enchirito will no longer be half price . <p> Adam : That blows ! I have to pay full price for my Enchirito ? No fuckin way , dude . This sucks . I knew I should have worked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you up , Adam . <p> Adam : Yes , sir . I 'm sorry . I am going to go clean the bathrooms now , right after I go change the sign for todays special . <p> Manager : Thank you , Adam . I am happy to see you take the initiative since I know that you are not on signage duty today . I commend your maturity . Keep it up and within six or nine months you could be head cashier and in charge of Mexican Pizzas . Good job , Adam . Now go change that sign with pride . Go Taco Bell ! <p> Adam : Yeah , uh huh . <p> So that is toatlly how it probably went down . Adam went right out to the sign and took a virtual dump on his job . I hope he had a good time on the fourth of July . And Adam , if you read this , please contact me at sideofmustard@gmail.com because I want to tell you how cool you are and interview you as well . <p> It seems like only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting out my love for all things Taco Bell . No sooner did I press " publish post " did I hear something that shook me to my core . No , I am not talking about the fact that Oprah has a half sister . I am not talking about the State of the Union address which I tried to watch but ended up watching Modern Family on Hulu instead . I am talking about the lawsuit that came out against Taco Bell claiming that their meat is only 35% beef . Some cocksmack ( new word I stole from a cranky waitress ) filed a lawsuit saying they were upset that testing showed that much of the beef in a crunchy beef taco is simply fillers like water , wheat oats , soy lecithin , maltodrextrin , modified corn starch and an anti-dusting agent . Hello , its Taco Bell . Who the fuck thought they were getting 100% grade A fucking beef ? This person probably thinks when he goes to McDonalds and orders chicken McNuggets he s getting chicken . That 's funny . Its McDonalds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to find healthy eating options . It is where we go when we need something cheap , fast and delicious and we have the rest of the day to spend on the toilet . I want to examine these mysterious ingredients that are allegedly in my Taco Bell meat and see if I want to continue eating there . <p> Water : Its good for you . Our body is made up of water . Seriously , I think we are like 98.6% water or something like that . No biggie . <p> Wheat oats : Again , these are good for you . Oatmeal , wheat bread , oatmeal cookies ? These are all things we should be happy that make it into our bodies because wheat oats have been proven to soak up all the alcohol . <p> Soy lecithin : Not sure what this is , but I like soy sauce so I say go with it . <p> Maltodrextrin : Again , not sure but it is probably something that just makes it taste better . I think it is the official name for cumin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have this is my pantry right now . I use it to make gravy . Gravy is good . Hurrah for modified corn starch ! <p> An anti-dusting agent : No idea . As long as its not a dusting agent like Pledge furniture polish or something that comes from a crop-dusting plane , I 'm okay with it . And since its the last ingredient , it means it is the least amount . Therefore , even if it is something from a crop-dusting plane , its not really enough to make it worth a goddamn fucking lawsuit . <p> Taco Bell came out with this statement : <p> Taco Bell prides itself on serving high quality Mexican inspired food with great value . Were happy that the millions of customers we serve every week agree . <p> You notice that they left out the part that said " And , yes it is too 100% beef , so shut your lying ass-face . " What will happen now ? Taco Bell will go to court and fight they they have a right to call their beef " beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it ai n't  all beef " and then Taco Bell will cave in and just change the name on the menu . They will call it a " beef-flavored taco " or a " crunchy Beaf-taco . " And people will continue to go to Taco Bell because we all know that anyone who goes there is n't going because they are looking for health food . They are going because they want some cheap-ass lunch for under six bucks . Yo quiero Taco Bell ? Hell yes yo quireo Taco Bell . 35% or 100% beef , yo quiero fucking Taco Bell . <p> I loves me some tacos . Mainly because they go perfectly with margaritas but also because they keep me in touch with my ( half ) Mexican heritage . I have never met a Taco Bell I did n't  like but I have also made sweet love to Del Taco , Taco Cabana , Two Pesos and the Super Taco from Jack and the Box . ( Once on a cross country trip from Texas to California , my friend Stephanie and I stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  matter if we were hungry or not ; if we saw one , we stopped and I got a Mexi Melt . ) I saw in the news the other day something that caught my eye because it had the word " taco " in it . A restaurant in Arizona was making a name for itself by selling exotic tacos every Wednesday . By exotic , I assumed they meant they put red cabbage instead of lettuce or Monterrey Jack instead of cheddar . But no . These bitches are selling lion tacos . Lion . Tacos . Who in the bloody fucking hell wants to eat a lion taco ? All I would be able to think about is The Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz saying " Put em up , put em up " as I spread sour cream all over it . <p> According to the vast amount of research I have done ( I Googled it ) , lion meat is not illegal and it is $100 a pound so these tacos would be cost prohibitive for me anyway . Unless that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it . I suppose it is technically no different from a beef enchilada , chicken fajitas or a fish taco . ( Which are are disgusting by the way . I tried a " fish taco " my sophomore year in college when I was really drunk . Her name was Laura . ) I guess the main difference is that we do n't  normally eat lion . Or tiger . Or bear . Maybe I find it shocking because I grew up eating Hamburger Helper and I am used to the idea of eating cows . Maybe there is a place in the world where a lion sandwich is a perfectly acceptable lunch . I also wonder why we call it " hamburger " and not just " cow . " I order a chicken sandwich but not a cow sandwich . This post is confusing me . <p> The day after I discovered the lion taco place , they came out and said they were taking it off the menu because of all the flack they got . The owner of the restaurant probably never even intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He just wanted some press and he got it . No word yet on what their next exotic taco on Wednesday will be . <p> " Would you like hot or mild sauce with your tacos de penguin ? " " Mild , please .

The man at booth one was practically crying out for a vinegar and water cocktail with a baking soda and iodine chaser . From the moment he and his friends sat down , he copped a not-so-fresh attitude with me . He did n't  like his seat and complained about it but did n't  want to be moved to another table . He was one of those people who like to find something wrong but not do anything about it so that they can continue to have something to gripe about . And then he asked me one of my least favorite questions any customer can ask me : " what do you got to drink ? " Seriously ? We are a bar . You passed a bartender who was standing in front of row upon row of bottles of liquor , just tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a full bar so he could order whatever he would like . He paused a moment and then said , " You got grappa ? " <p> " No , sir , I 'm sorry , but we do n't  have grappa . " <p> He rolled his eyes and then said , " Well , then you 're not a full bar . " <p> Was he for real ? No , we do n't  have grappa . We also do n't  have ouzo , absinthe or manischewitz so choose one of our eight vodkas , four gins , four rums , three brandies , six whiskeys , nine beers or six wines and move on . <p> " What about champagne ? You got champagne ? " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> " Well , what kind is it ? Is it any good ? " <p> " We have Marquis de la Tour Brut from Loire , France . Would you like a bottle ? " <p> After snubbing his nose as if I just offered him a bottle of my piss ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ordered a bottle . I quickly returned with four glasses and placed them on his table as the bartender put his champagne on ice . When I showed up to pop the cork ( hopefully into his eyeball ) he hands me a glass and says , " Can you chill these ? " <p> I went to chill the glasses . It was n't a completely awful thing of him to ask , it was just the way he asked it as is so often the problem . No please , thank you or eye contact necessary . A co-worker eventually took the glasses and poured for me because it was obvious that this guy was getting under my skin . <p> Everyone who comes into the club has a two-drink minimum . We tell them when they make their reservation , when they arrive , when we seat them , its on the seating pass , its on the menu , its on the postcard that the performer gave them and I tell them when I take their order . A bottle of wine or champagne serves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their minimum . Throughout the show , they kept telling me they did n't  want anything else . They were fine . When I printed the check , I had to put four minimum charges on at $5.00 per person . Guess who did n't  like that . <p> " Well , we did n't  know we had to get two drinks per person . How are we supposed to know that ? How much does a bottle count for ? " He was told that a bottle is four beverages . " Well , we are four people , so that should be enough ! " <p> " Two beverages per person , sir . " <p> " Right , we had a bottle of champagne and there were four of us . That should be enough .

The server told me that you said her " big day was ruined . " Well , honey , if my birthday passed without a bunch people I do n't  know begrudgingly singing Happy Birthday to me off-key , I 'd call that a rip-roaring success . And you 're mad because they did n't  put a candle in the cake ? They did n't  have any fucking candles . Do you want your server to pull one out of her ass ? Or how about they just put a chopstick in it and light it on fire ? Or a Bic lighter ? Would that have made her " special day " any better ? And then you 're not going to leave a tip ? Why in the hell does the server have to pay the price for a corporate policy ? If you 're unhappy with the policy at a restaurant , do what every other disappointed customer does these days : go to Yelp and write a review about it and then go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking coupon for a free Apple Chimicheesecake and 10% off your next visit . <p> And to the little girl , I say this : aim higher . The next time your mom wants to take you somewhere for your big day , choose someplace where she 's gon na have to dig a little deeper into her pockets . You 're worth more than $32 ( and that was for two adults and two children , by the way . ) When you are older and look back on this day of disappointment , you will realize that not having the servers sing to you was a blessing in disguise . When I worked at Houlihans in Times Square , we were all singers . Before and after work , all of us were auditioning for Broadway shows . We could sing , like really sing , but when someone asked us to sing to them for their birthday , we would choose five different keys and and turn the volume to " shut the hell up . " It was not pretty . It was just our way to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , your mom can take you to Chuck E. Cheese or better yet , she will pony up the cash for a sheet cake from Costco and you can be surrounded by people who actually care about you and will want to sing Happy Birthday to you . <p> Okay , Im done . That just rubs me wrong when people stiff the server for something the server has nothing to do with . Just remember : no server ever ever ever wants to sing happy birthday to you . Ever . <p> You people are obviously not understanding what a tip is . A tip is a gratitude for the service you provide . If your caring and go about and beyond hey 80% of the time your tip will as well . DUHHHH ! ! Simple recognition of her birthday would have been enough . To not even care , then why would she . Kudos to you lady . I would have done the same , coming from a server/bartender of 12yrs , having pennies tipped and thrown at me . If you think you gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work at McDonalds <p> With 12 years serving , I am shocked that you do n't  understand what a tip is . A tip is the balance of a maybe reasonable wage that the restaurant is too cheap or greedy to pay you . Do n't  leave a 20% tip , well okay then . Do n't  stiff your server unless what happens is egregious , which this clearly was not . This was restaurant policy . Do n't  stiff your server . And yes , I ve been there and done that . <p> it was n't even the singing part I hated the most , it was running around trying to beg other busy servers ( or servers pretending to be busy ) to come sing with me , so I did n't  have to stand there like a jackass and do it alone . there was one time I worked in a small place by myself and started to sing , and everyone at the table just sat there and looked at me . I actually stopped to say " Youre making me do this by msyelf ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . I could care less if their birthday is fucking happy or not . You know how awkward it is to be the ONLY person singing that asinine song ? <p> I hate , hate , HATE birthdays . I remember once at a restaurant I used to work at , I was slammed at around five pm on a Saturday night . Eight top , six top , two four tops and a fourteen top slammed . Being the only person working a double meant I got all the parties that came in during shift change and we had to make our own salads , which we all know that when one middle aged lady orders a salad , they ALL order a salad . So I had five of the fucking things , all different , I 've got three trays in the window that need run and someone else needs birthday singers . Like hell that was going to happen so I told her no . Then my manager at the time comes walking into the kitchen and tells me that I NEED TO STOP MAKING THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait to get my tables food out so someone can hear an off-key version of row , row , row your boat with the words changed ? But me being the perfect fucking angel I am explained the situation with the salads and the trays that needed to go ( keep in mind I 'm still putting oranges and cranberries on some ladys Biker Chik salad ) , and she said tough shit , I have to sing . So I dropped everything , walked out of the kitchen , and led the stupid fucking birthday . <p> I used to get everyone up in the restaurant , as many servers and employees and almost every single customer ( we were designed in a circle and we had about 22 booths or so but there was the server station and front counter in the middle so it allowed for a bit of privacy to guests ) - I was only turned down maybe three times then I would cart everyone over to the table and we would all sing happy birthday . <p> Even worse than the singing is when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Its my birthday , what do I get ? " I was going to comp you a birthday dessert but now I want to tell you to get the hell out . Just order a dessert , casually mention its your birthday , and hope for the best . If you do n't  get that piece of $5 cake for free , oh well . <p> OH MY GOSH ! ! ! This is great . Thanks for the inside to the signing . I always hated it , it was more to embarrass the person we were with then the servers . I would NEVER not tip because they would n't sing ! That is just crazy ! This woman was wrong to do that ! I wish I knew where the server was from so I could go there and tip them more to cover what that stupid lady did ! <p> i bartend , my fav is when people ask me when they get a free birthday shot , my answers no obviously , i 'm not gon na risk my job for some stranger but then when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its not even their birthday , LOL MAN I LOVE CALLING PEOPLE OUT ON THAT SHIT <p> I got a double shot of tequila for my birthday at a Mexican restaurant . They even sang happy birthday . I was n't expecting anything I actually did n't  expect a Mexican restaurant to sing happy birthday , I did n't  know they did that . <p> you ppl are the most self righteous ignorant ppl ! you do not know that ladies circumstances or why that mothers nerves were edgey . Maybe that was the only birthday she could provide her baby , maybe she just lost everything or is homeless with no family or a backyard to have a party . judgemental ass you can be assured you will be judged at the same measure . This mom may now read this considering this ignorant rant of this ass low life waitress is on facebook and her child may read it also . Obviously there was a reason that mom was so broken but self righteous ass did n't  care about that . Also the obvious low life waitresses rant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disappointed mother wrote . Judge yourself because its obvious from your words that you were not raised right , and have no room to judge some childs mother who you have no clue anything about . <p> OK , I 'll bite . Maybe the moms having a rough day.how is it the servers fault that he is LITERALLY NOT ALLOWED to sing to **31;287;TOOLONG kid ? Why does he lose a tip because his employer has an actual rule that he is supposed to follow ? <p> And no , its not " obvious there was a reason the mom is so broken " . some people are just self righteous , want everything done for them their way , and do n't  give a crap about anyone else , never thinking about the people who they are taking money from ( maybe the waiter is homeless , or strapped for cash , and is trying to earn an honest living ? hey man , if you can throw out ridiculous situations you can apply them the other way too ! ) <p> Dawn that was just a poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday song before she arrived ! We do n't  sing at our restaurant and people call and ask if we do all the time so I do n't  think the waitress was wrong ! <p> Trying to justify not tipping the server because she was following policy seems pretty judgmental to me . To go as far as saying that the server was responsible for ruining the kids birthday because she was not prepared for it with candles ? ! ! Do n't  know the mothers situation but her not planning ahead and taking enough initiative in HER childs birthday to even call the restaurant and see if they could accommodate ? Nice save mom ! Now you child will never know that you forgot ! Whheew <p> As a former server I have a message for the birthday boy/girl .. Screw you and your birthday we are complete strangers to you and to be quite honest nobody gives a shit . In fact you are really pathetic if you expect the staff of a busy restaurant to stop what they are doing to come to your table to entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is fine I will be happy to bring your free desert but do n't  expect anything else . <p> Wow , servers seem to be pretty judgmental . When you work at a restaurant , guest satisfaction is a part of it . Its part of being an adult . If you do n't  like accommodating guests , its imports to find a different job . Then both parties will be happy . Do it well , or do n't  do it all . As mentioned , you do n't  know the mothers story . While I understand that it was the restaurants policy not to sing happy birthday , there is no need for any of you to attack the mother , who was legitimately disappointed . Perhaps this was the one year she could give her child the luxury of going out to dinner . We should never judge each others circumstances . Let 's all try to be kinder . <p> What guests do n't  realize is yes you have to stop what your doing ( which could possibly be bringing their hot food out ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing just to sing happy birthday . Then the other guests are wondering where their drink is or where their food is . We are usually already running around trying to take care of our guests . When you have to stop and try to recruit singers that means we can not do the other things we are supposed to be doing . I try and not work for establishments that sing happy birthday to guests . Its not that I do n't  want to make guests birthdays memorable and happy . Its because I prefer doing my job and frankly stopping to sing hampers me from doing so . <p> Yeah maybe the lady was was having a bad day but to take out her disappointment on the server is just shitty , she got a free dessert and still was n't happy ? Come on now ! And to flip the script maybe that server she stiffed has a child too <p> I love how she says , " We wanted to give a better tip " That would imply that they left one to begin with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small electrical fire in the dining room . Nothing ignited , thankfully , but the restaurant filled with smoke and had to be immediately evacuated in the middle of the dinner rush . A man actually complained in the parking lot to my manager that we had ruined his girlfriends birthday . Because its our fault the restaurant filled with smoke , apparently . I 'm still facepalming . <p> My to go answer when somebody tells me its my birthday what do I get ? I politely reply oh wow happy birthday its my birthday too but I had to work they would n't give me the day off : ( , where I work we have a pretty cool way to get you for been a dumb human asking me to sing for you , when somebody tells you its my birthday what do I get for free I can seriously answer a whipped cream pie in your face , you do n't  believe me fine , we actually do it we pretend like we care play a song , we kind of do the singing once we are done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw on fire goes to your face . YOU CANT COMPLAIN , that 's our companys policy , that 's actually how we get even with annoying people , its awesome .. Or if your cool with me and do n't  ask be for free stuff I 'll get the table shots of tequila and I can take shots with my table only if you do n't  ask for free stuff ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
@@106055310 @1455310/ <h> Louises Story ( Frat Boys and Margaritas ) <p> My friend " Louise " told me a story about how she got a shitty tip at her Mexican restaurant job . The bill was $93 and she got four bucks and eventually five more making it a solid 10% . This is my version of her story : <p> It was long tough night at Big Brother Bubbas Burrito Bar Buffet and Mexican Style Olde Timey Cantina where Louise had been punching the clock for five years . Bubbas was a nice neighborhood Mexican restaurant with good food , good service and a good staff . One of Louises co-workers had called in sick and there was no one to cover for her , so Louise had the whole restaurant to herself . It was a tall order , but for a Tuesday night , it would be okay . The tips that night were average . Despite stellar service , for Louise knew no other way to serve , she was getting 12-15% at every table . " What the hell ? " she thought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why is no one giving me the 20% I am earning ? " She shrugged it off and headed to her next table . <p> It was a four-top ; three frat boys and a young woman with blond hair and dark roots and she was wearing a t-shirt that said " Men are like snow storms : you never know when they 're coming , how many inches you 'll get or how long theyll last . " She was a real class act . Each of the frat boys were wearing their caps backward because they thought it looked cool when really it just looked stupid as fuck . They sucked down a few margaritas and asked for more free chips and salsa too many times , but Louise served them with a smile because she is a real pro . When she set their bill down , the check came to a total of $93.00 . She saw that they were having difficulty dividing the bill ; some had cash and some had credit cards and all of them were drunk bitches with no recollection of simple math @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their phones . They finally handed her a a pile of cash and one credit card . <p> " Heres sixty dollars in cash and put the rest on this credit card , " the wannabe blond slurred out . <p> Louise touched on her own nose in the hope that it would signal to the girl that she should wipe the salt off of her face . The girl did n't  pick up the hint and Louise went on her way . Moments later , after the group had stumbled out , Louise saw that that the credit card slip had a four dollar tip scrawled onto it . " Four freakin dollars ? Four ? Are you kiddin me ? After all those chips , they 're gon na give me four feakin dollars on a $93 bill ? ? Uh uh . " She headed to the sidewalk to find the dumb fucks and ask them if there was some non-existent problem with the service . <p> On the street , she saw two of the frat boys smoking cigarettes , leaning on each other because they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admired the taller ones calf muscles yet he only seemed to notice them when he had been drinking and he thought this was a good time to tell him how attractive his legs looked , no homo . <p> Shorter Frat Boy quickly pulled away from his friend and thrust his hands into his pockets . " What , we werent doing anything , I did n't  even notice his sinewy calf muscles and I have never been attracted to a man in my entire life , what ? " There was an awkward silence . " I mean , what was that you were saying , miss ? " <p> " On a $93 check , you 're gon na leave me four bucks ? Why ? Why ? " <p> Taller Frat Boy , who had moved away from his friend by at least six inches , said , " Our friend was supposed to leave more of a tip on the credit card . She did n't  ? " <p> " No , she did n't  . She left me four dollars . " <p> " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Taller Frat Boy reached into his pocket and dug around for more cash . He could n't help but notice that Shorter Frat Boy was eyeing him as he did it . Shorter Frat Boys line of vision moved from his friends crotch and then to his eyes , catching him staring back at him . Shorter Frat Boy said abruptly in a lower than usual voice , " Dude , I fuckin love football , do n't  you ? " <p> " Look , this is all I have , five more dollars , take it . " He handed the money to Louise and ignored his friend who seemed to be adjusting his crotch . <p> " Great , so now we 've made it a 10% tip , thanks so much , " she said , the sarcasm dripping in much the same way that Shorter Frat Boys penis was dripping with pre-cum . <p> Neither Louise nor the Frat Boys noticed that a few feet away was someone with their flip cam recording the scene because the young videographer felt that it could lead to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " 10% is a crappy tip , just so you know . You think its easy working at Big Brother Bubbas Burrito Bar Buffet and Mexican Style Olde Timey Cantina ? Well , it is n't . I depend on tips because in New york State , my wage is $5. oo an hour and all of it goes to taxes , so my check is never more than twenty bucks . Next time you go out to dinner , you best make sure you have enough money to leave a freakin tip , alright ? Or just stay out of my restaurant . " <p> The girl with the camera made sure the sign to Bubbas was in the background . <p> Taller Frat Boy began to say something but before he could , Louise continued . " Save your breath , save your apologies and save me the misfortune of ever having to wait on you again . Go away and do n't  come back , alright ? Fucking douche bags . You make my balls ache and I do n't  even have any ! ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know what you mean about balls aching . I feel like mine are- " <p> Louise interrupted him . " And you need to get laid . Ive been watching you stare at your friend all freakin night . Get a room already , Jesus . Yeah , " she said to Taller Frat Boy . " Your friend here has the hots for you . Do yourself a favor and let him go down on ya already . Jeez , its so freakin obvious . " Louise spun on her heels and went back to work . <p> Girl With the Camera continued filming and saw Shorter Frat Boy melt into a pool of tears and then turn and run down the street screaming , I love women . I love football . I am a heterosexual male ! " Taller Frat Boy then threw up for the camera and the girl knew she had something good to put on the Internet . <p> Ten minutes later , the video was posted on YouTube , Facebook , Google+ and MySpace and had over a 1,000 views . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had over 25,000 views and by the end of the week it had been featured on D-Listed , Perez Hilton and Broke Straight Boys .

Everyone was eager to meet the woman who had made a frat boy cry and they all wanted to leave her big fat tips . It all turned out perfectly . Well , except for the two frat boys . Taller One eventually married the wannabe blond cheap skank bitch and Shorter One joined a pray-the gay-away clinic that was owned by Michele Bachmanns totally not gay husband , Marcus . <p> But for Louise , it tuned out great . 109839 @qwx969839 
@@106055312 @1455312/ <h> Category Archives : potty training <p> Parents and the people who take care of kids never cease to amaze me with their ability to make bad decisions . For example , is potty-training at a restaurant okay ? What if its an outdoor cafe , does that make it any better ? It is easy to assume that most people would think its a bad decision to pull out a porta-potty and plop it out in public , but a woman in New York City this week thought , " Sure , kid . Go ahead and take a squat right here next to Table 9 . " Gothamistposted a photo online of this very incident happening at a cafe on the Upper West Side . All together now : <p> What the fuckity fuck , lady ? <p> It is understandable that potty-training is hard . I barely recall my own personal training , but I am pretty sure I was a dream . Being such a neat freak , I was probably potty-trained by the age of four months and then judging all the other babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diapers . Fucking , amateurs . Although I have no kids of my own , other than Albert the cardboard baby , I feel pretty certain that I would never let my kid take a dump on the sidewalk . Maybe things change when you 're a parent or maybe sometimes things just happen . Who would have thought that I would ever need to get off the 7 train at Hunters Point just to puke and then get right back on the next train ? Shit ( or vomit ) happens , right ? Looking at the photo , several questions arise : <p> Where is this woman planning on disposing of whatever she finds in that pot ? <p> Does she plan on washing her hands or will a Baby Wipe suffice ? <p> Why does that child not have on any shoes ? Its New York fucking City . <p> Is that a diaper laying on the sidewalk ? <p> Is this the nanny and if so , does the mom know this is happening ? <p> How does she expect him to squeeze out some business without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play his turns on Words With Friends ? <p> Does that man on the left hand side of the photo know what is going on ? <p> Is that man jealous that the kid can drop a load in public but he cant ? <p> Why is that woman wearing a slip cover from West Elm as a dress ? <p> Is there another baby hidden underneath that blanket , and if so , what is its stance on public pooping ? <p> In all my years of restaurant work , I have never seen someone let their child drop the kids off at the pool in my station . One time , there was a dirty diaper rolled up into a teeny tiny ball and left on the plate , as if I would think it was just a napkin . That was pretty disgusting , but they did it without me knowing about it . I am pretty sure if they pulled a porta-potty out , I would have noticed . There is no word on what this persons server thought when she witnessed this act , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been : <p> " La-di-da , la-di-da , here I am at work on the Upper West Side , waiting tables at an outdoor cafe and loving every minute of it . I 'd better go check on Table 9- what the fuck ? ? Awwww , hell no , do not tell me I am seeing what I think I am seeing . Is that kid sitting on a little plastic toilet ? What the fuck , lady ? If she walks over here and asks me to go rinse it out , I will go all out crazy on this bitch . I need to go get me another job because if I see one more Upper West Side entitled bitch do something that is so fucking crazy , I will lose it . That 's it . I 'm done . Here is my apron , I quit . " <p> Thank you , West Elm Slip Cover Dress Lady . Thank you for reminding us that it takes all kinds to make this world go round . And speaking of going round , next time let 's try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet instead of some plastic commode sitting next to Table 9 . <p> How low can a parent go when it comes to that parent thinking the world revolves around their child ? According to a photo making its way around the Internet , pretty damn low . It happened at a restaurant in Lehi , Utah . A diner noticed a pair of twin girls sitting at the table across from her and the two girls had their jumpsuits down around their ankles . Upon closer inspection , it was determined that these girls were not sitting at booster seats like the average two year old , but were actually sitting on child port-a-potties . Yes folks , we may have found the Entitled Parent of the Year . Thanks to customer Kimberly Decker , we have photographic proof of the moment when manners were deemed no longer something of importance and a woman thought it was perfectly alright to let her kids take a dump while sitting naked in a dining room chowing down on chicken fingers . It truly may be the end of the world as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuckity fuck hell is wrong with people ? <p> I have seen parents let their kid throw food all over the place . I have seen parents let their children scribble on walls . I have even seen parents change a diaper at the table and then leave it in a tiny poopy ball on their plate next to the pickle spear they did n't  want . I have never seen someone think its acceptable to teach potty training between the entree and dessert . <p> I have had some experience with potty training . I took care a of a little girl for one full year and during that time potty training was an important part of our day . Its not easy trying to get the kid to go to the toilet instead of just letting it all out right there in the comfort of their own diaper . Personally , I resent the day my parents taught me that it was better to go poopy in the toilet . I look forward to reaching an an age where Depends is on my grocery list right next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fortune instead of being bothered to walk all the way to the bathroom to pull my pants down . When I was taking care of Lily , one time she was at the top of the slide and I saw her squat down . <p> " Lily , do you need to go to the bathroom ? " <p> " No , " she grunts . <p> " Are you sure ? Because it looks like you might need to go to a bathroom . " <p> " Stop looking at me ! " she screams . All this while atop of the slide in the park surrounded by people watching her . Two minutes later , she stands up and announces I went potty ! " <p> So , yes , I get that potty training is not easy . But you do n't  take your kids to a restaurant and plop their little bare asses onto a port-a-potty and then order lunch . What was this mother thinking ? I also want to know what her plan was for removing the two port-a-potties once they were filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a doggie bag and then also for him to run them through the dishwasher ? Or maybe she would have taken them to the bathroom and rinsed them out in the sink next to the lady who is reapplying her lipstick . Or perhaps she would just throw them in her trunk and carry them back home . More than likely , she had n't  thought that far in advance because she clearly is an addle-brained moron with shit for brains . <p> The restaurant says they were not aware of the incident until after it happened or they most certainly would have asked them to leave . But did n't  the server see what was going on ? Why did n't  he say something ? You can bet your freshly Baby Wiped bottom dollar that my bitchy ass would have piped in : <p> Hello , Im Bitchy and I 'll be your server today . Our soup of the day is gazpacho with a sliced cucumber garnish and we have a lovely roasted beet salad served with arugula , walnuts and balsamic reduction- OH HELL NO ! Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no that ai n't  happening here , miss . There is something called health codes and I 'm pretty sure that bowel movements and portable toilets do n't  fit into that equation . You need to pardon me excuse yourself not only from my station and from the restaurant but from civilization because what you 're doing is kinda like the goddamned nastiest thing I have ever seen . Out . Right now . Let 's move it , mother of the year . Pull them pants up on them little girls and you can sashay your potty training asses over to Chuck E. Cheese if you still need some lunch cause I ai n't  watching your kids squeeze out some business while I am trying to make a living slinging hash . <p> So here are my questions to you : what would you have done if you were the server and this was happening at your table ? What would you have done if you were a customer and you saw this happening ? And most importantly , what has happened to common sense and decency ?

LONG ... 15 Nov 2011 04:55:00 LONG ... is the true story of a little boy named Edgar . Edgar was a bus boy at a little tiny restaurant in Queens . He was always flat broke because he was known to go out on the weekend and get so plastered that he would either spend all of his money or lose it ; he was never quite sure which . One day at the restaurant , the Big Bad Chef overheard Edgar saying how badly he was in need of money . The chef , always one to take advantage of someone elses misfortune if he thought it could benefit him in any way , said to Edgar , " I know a way you can make an easy hundred bucks . " Edgars eyes lit up ; his two favorite words were " easy " and " money " so the chef had certainly gotten his attention . <p> " Okay , what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poor Edgar . <p> " You ever hear of the Cinnamon Challenge ? " <p> Of course Edgar had never heard of it but if it involved an easy hundred bucks , he definitely wanted to learn more . The Cinnamon Challenge is when someone tries to swallow a tablespoon of cinnamon without the aid of water and it must be done within sixty seconds and without spitting any of it out . Cinnamon is delicious on things like French Toast or rolls or oatmeal , but alone on a tablespoon it does not have the same appeal . However , Edgar eagerly accepted the challenge . <p> The crew headed down to the basement where the giant container of cinnamon sat on a shelf waiting to be used in a proper fashion . Big Bad Chef grabbed the plastic canister and dipped a tablespoon into it . " So you got ta put the whole spoonful in your mouth and swallow it . No water and no spitting . If you get it all down in under a minute , the money is yours . " He slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed the spoon to Edgar . Edgar thought this was going to be a breeze . Its just a tablespoon , right ? " Ready ? " said Chef . " Three , two , one , GO ! " <p> Edgar dumped the spoon of cinnamon into his mouth and began to swallow it . Within seconds , his eyes started to water and his throat started to constrict , but he persevered . Trying not to cough , he closed his eyes tight and focused on how many Coronas he could buy with a hundred dollars . Thirty seconds into the challenge , he held back a cough . The Chef was starting to get worried . At forty-five seconds , the spice got the best of him and he coughed sending out a cloud of brown powder all over his shirt and the floor . It was not pretty but the basement now smelled like a big holiday candle . The Chef reached over to the money . " You lose , loser , " he said . Edgar grabbed a glass of water and chugged it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . Gagging and spitting , his throat hurt and his eyes burned but nothing was more painful than seeing everyone laugh at his failure . <p> " I knew you could n't fucking do it ! " The Chef put the twenty dollars bills back in his pocket and went up stairs laughing all the way . <p> Edgar brushed off his shirt and finished the water . He was okay now but did n't  know if he would ever be able to eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch for breakfast again . Back upstairs , the Chef gave a play by play recount of the event for anyone who had n't  seen it firsthand . Eventually , Edgar made his way back upstairs . He smelled nice but he was still broke . <p> Its not an easy challenge to win . Edgar gave it a good shot though . " Maybe next time , " he thought . Poor Edgar . I think he might be a little naive . Later that night the Chef gave him a peace offering . He handed him a spoon of " whipped cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so basically a spoon of egg whites . Edgar also told me that a few days earlier Chef had asked him to taste the sauce for the special of the day . Edgar swallowed the whole serving which he quickly learned was a ramekin of chicken fat . <p> A word of advice to Edgar : if anyone offers you a Soggy Biscuit , do n't  take it .

That shit ran all the time usually when you were watching your stories to see if Luke and Laura were going to stay together on " General Hospital . " Sally offered all of us the opportunity to learn at home and get better jobs and promotions . If you called the 1-800 number you could be on your way to an exciting career in learning the personal computer , interior decorating , child day care , gun repair , or even catering ! Luckily for me , I had an innate skill for catering and gun repair so I never had to call the number . Other people who are too afraid to make the call that will change their life have to come up with other ways to make more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on vacation once . <p> I was sitting on the bus in San Francisco when I heard this dumb bitch behind me yapping on her cell phone . She was jib jabbing away about things that nobody cared about but we were all forced to listen to . And then things got interesting . She started to tell her friend how she had discovered a new way to make more money at her job . I thought that maybe she was n't as dumb as she sounded because she clearly seemed as of she wanted to move ahead in her career . My nosy ass started listening closer to see if I could glean some wisdom from this career-minded independent woman . And then I realized she was a fucking cocktail waitress . And her brilliant idea to make more money was basically stealing . She had realized that if she did n't  ring in all the drinks and just collected the money , she could then pocket that cash as her own . Bitch , please . Does she really think she is the first one to come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dawn of time . I think Benjamin Franklin was pocketing coins the same way when he was waiting tables at Ye Olde Tavern Inn back in 1750 right before he discovered electricity and invented bifocals . She was all proud of herself for discovering stealing . " Girl , I took a hundred dollars last night . If I could do that three times a week that would be like ( ridiculously long pause here as she tried to multiply ) $300 dollars a week ! " Yes , honey or $1200 a month . And then two to three years in jail when they bust your ass for theft . She was clearly not the brightest bulb . Every smart thieving waiter knows that taking that much a week is just asking for trouble . Start small . Ten dollars here and ten dollars there . What a fucking amateur . <p> I do n't  steal from my jobs . Not worth it . Sure maybe the occasional cocktail or a lunch that I eat that I do n't  pay for , but cash ? No way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked at a Putt-Putt miniature golf course and pilfered a few bucks a day to pay for my Dairy Queen blizzards and my lunch of chicken sandwich from the Burger King that shared the parking lot with me . But nothing since then . ( Sorry , Putt-Putt . I was young and hungry and only making $5.00 an hour . ) Word of advice : do n't  steal . <p> If you want to make more money , take Sallys advice and call this number : 1-800-228-3800 . ( That shit is probably disconnected by now . ) And you can watch her commercial here and be on your way to financial freedom .

The first order I ever took , I remember that the man asked me for his brontosaurus burger to be rare and I was like , " Umm , no shit , its always rare . We ai n't  discovered fire yet , asshole . " Needless to say , I know my way around a tray . However , today at work I am going in early to be trained . Keep in mind I have been at this particular job for over three years so I was under the impression that I knew how to take an order and then carry a drink twenty feet and hand it to someone , but I guess I was wrong . Last week , a head server was determined and today I will go meet with that head server to learn important information about either serving drinks or giving head . Fingers crossed its about oral sex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head server was born on August 26th , 1990 . I looked at my diary from that day to see what I was doing when our head server made her first appearance on this earth . It said , " August 26th , 1990 : work was a bitch and so was the hostess . " I have been waiting tables literally since the day she was born . Here is a list of some things that are older than the person who who will be training me today : <p> My Birkenstocks that I bought in 1987 . <p> This diary entry from August 25th , 1990 : " Up at 7:30 and to an audition . Home an napped for two hours , then to a call back . I did good . Then to work at Bennigans which was okay . Now to sleep for a long time .

It has been said that you cant teach an old dog new tricks but I do not know if that holds true for waiters . My mind is open to new possibilities for this training . Maybe there is some new way to take orders that I have not learned of yet . Have I been wasting time using pen and paper when I could have been sending the orders telepathically ? Have I been wasting steps carrying drinks when they could have been teleported directly to the table ? I will learn all of these wonderful new techniques tonight at 5:00 . I expect that tomorrow , my blog will have to change its name to " The Newly Trained Waiter Who Is No Longer Bitchy But is Wonderfully Proficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show me the way .

The only thing you might get from a 23YO on either subject is that enthusiasm that we all had at that age . <p> Knowing what I think I know about 20 year olds , they probably have a better way to give a blow job , at least a kinkier way than what we know .

You 've got a few years on me but I 've been bartending for 15 years and I ca n't tell you how much I love some kid trying to tell me how to make a drink . Most recently I had one tell me I had no idea how to make a caipirinha and that I should be using rum and powdered sugar . = He no longer works there . <p> I too have been waiting tables since the beginning of time .

Running up to the host stand to bed and plead for tables . Everyone has worked with the server who makes friends with the host and then tries to coerce them into giving them more or better tables .. this is extremely annoying . We all want tables . If every server on the floor was hanging out at the host stand trying to snag the next party it would be very chaotic . <p> 9 . Standing in front of the kitchen door talking . The last thing any of us want is to stand there with a huge tray of hot food and wait for you to finish your conversation while we repeatedly say behind you excuse me . I cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 8 . Taking forever in the computer . It is very annoying when someone still has no idea where anything is in the computer and takes an eternity to ring up an order . Even worse is the one who did n't  write it down and is trying to remember the order while you are not so patiently waiting behind them . <p> 7 . The " Can I just cut in front of you at the computer to do insert whatever task is more important than yours here " person . I waited in line for my turn , no you cant just print a check , check the gift card balance , run the credit card , unhold your food , enter the app , ring up a bar drink you can do whatever you want as soon as I finish what I am doing <p> 6 . Usually the same person as #7 who just cuts in line at the drink station Its ok , I was n't waiting here to get my drinks or anything squeezing in to grab a glass then asking the person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still cutting the line and is extremely annoying . <p> 5 . The too good for filling ice and glasses servers/cant run their own food servers . No there is n't little elves that fill the ice for you , and yes I do mind filling the ice bin for the 6th time tonight so you can get drinks for all your tables .. the servers who just expect everyone else to fill everything so they can just show up and make money are rude and lazy . Also people who expect every other server to deliver all their own food fall in this category . <p> 4 . The Whine about every table people . These are the servers who have something to complain about with every table they get . they just go on and on to anyone who will listen and try to make everyone miserable . the bill is too low , they are drinking water , they smell funny , they talk funny , they ask too many questions they are n't  talking enough , they wont put the phone down , did you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut , why do they have to order tea , how many bowls of salad can one person eatetc <p> 3 . The always needing something server . There is one every shift .. they can have only 1 table going and they are weeded .. asking everyone else have you got a sec .. no one minds helping out , but to be doing all our own tables and getting stuff for all your tables all night is annoying . <p> 2 . The " waterer . " This is the one who when you forget to log out of the computer feels the need to ring up a water for every table in the building because they either think its funny , or feel they have to teach you a lesson to log out . <p> And the most annoying coworker is . <p> 1 . The " am I cut yet " person . This is the server who follows the manager around asking to be cut , takes a survey with all the other servers to see who is cut , checks all the hosts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be cut . Gets really mad when anyone is cut before them , tries to play sick when they start their shift so they can be cut first .. comes up with every excuse as to why they want to leave . whines about every table they get when it gets close to closing time Just get a different job . 109836 @qwx969836 <h> 12 thoughts on " 10 Ways Servers Annoy Other Servers ( guest post ) " <p> Ahahahaha , number 9 is one of my biggest pet peeves . Another favorite is when you call for a hand and watch someone walk right out of the kitchen with nothing in their hands and then they go hide in a side station . I will refuse to help you for the rest of the shift if you do that ( more points when its THEIR food you just expod and they wont run ) . Said person then complains how no one will help them later on that night . Really bitch ? This same person is the " Am I cut ? " person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how can I get my side work doneeeee ? ) that they just got tables and heaven forbid if they do n't  get cut ! Why are you here ? Why do you complain you do n't  get enough shifts ? And btw , why are you complaining to the server who is always last to leave ? Do n't  worry though , I 'm laughing at you all the way to the bank ! <p> These are the ones with a kid , another job , or just hate working certain days of the week . Or maybe they 're just plain lazy . But there always seems to be at least one server in every restaurant that ends up giving away all of their shifts except for maybe one or two per week . <p> You 'll get that text in the morning . Or maybe the afternoon , while you 're working . " Can you pick up my night side ? " Awesome , that nice afternoon shift you had just turned into a swing . <p> yes ! and that same server will never ever pick up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no matter how sick you are . Half the time they do n't  even respond at all . Those are the ones I never cover for anymore , I do n't  even make up an excuse , its just nope , I do n't  want to . I already work 5 shifts a week , and you ca n't figure out how to work 2 ? Then why are you even employed ? <p> And the equally-obnoxious correlate . The server who you take a shift for because you truly sympathized with them , and then refuses to take a shift of yours for a pathetic reason that they do n't  even have the good sense to lie about . <p> Or the people who ask to beg you to take your shift . " I was only scheduled 2 days this week , will anybody let me work theirs ? ! " , then add the sob story , " I have to pay child support ( or my insurance , or my boyfriends birthday is next week etc ) " <p> Water Bombing is what we called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fuck . Darden . BTW ) . I have done it once , and exactly once . It was a slow day , I 'd had -maybe- 3 tables during my lunch shift and someone left their screen up . I water bombed him hard . He laughed about it and said that was the first time someone had ever gotten him . <p> My #1 pet peeve though , is when someone sneaks up and unites my apron . Nothing infuriates me more than this Aside from maybe the waiter who picks up 10 extra tables outside of their section and can not be bothered with sidework . At all . At any point during the night . Unless its something they need immediately . <p> I worked at a really shitty Mexican restaurant for like a month ( it was in the dry part of a wet/dry county , so no alcohol was served there ) Normally , Mexican places you have to balance plates on your arm , but this one used large trays . While carrying a tray loaded down with several fajita slippers , side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that , more extra to roll up the fajitas on , and the tortilla warmers for a table , this stupid bitch I worked with untied my apron as I was walking to the table . Out in the dining room in front of everyone . <p> I was completely livid wicked pissed off . I had to stop , grab a tray stand and stop before even making it to my table to tie my apron back on and then half embarrassed and very angry on the way to my table . <p> Once I was finished dropping everything off and getting refills , I dragged her to the back and gave her a metric fuck ton of shit for pulling that little prank on me . <p> May I simply just say what a comfort to find a person that truly knows what they are talking about online . You certainly realize how to bring an issue to light and make it important . More people ought to check this out and understand this side of your story . Its surprising you 're not more popular since you surely possess the gift . 
@@106055333 @1455333/ <p> Parents and the people who take care of kids never cease to amaze me with their ability to make bad decisions . For example , is potty-training at a restaurant okay ? What if its an outdoor cafe , does that make it any better ? It is easy to assume that most people would think its a bad decision to pull out a porta-potty and plop it out in public , but a woman in New York City this week thought , " Sure , kid .

Who would have thought that I would ever need to get off the 7 train at Hunters Point just to puke and then get right back on the next train ? Shit ( or vomit ) happens , right ? Looking at the photo , several questions arise : <p> Where is this woman planning on disposing of whatever she finds in that pot ? <p> Does she plan on washing her hands or will a Baby Wipe suffice ? <p> Why does that child not have on any shoes ?

One time , there was a dirty diaper rolled up into a teeny tiny ball and left on the plate , as if I would think it was just a napkin .

I also want to know what her plan was for removing the two port-a-potties once they were filled . Did she think she would just ask her server for a doggie bag and then also for him to run them through the dishwasher ? Or maybe she would have taken them to the bathroom and rinsed them out in the sink next to the lady who is reapplying her lipstick . Or perhaps she would just throw them in her trunk and carry them back home . More than likely , she had n't  thought that far in advance because she clearly is an addle-brained moron with shit for brains . <p> The restaurant says they were not aware of the incident until after it happened or they most certainly would have asked them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on ?

Is that little girl sitting on a toilet ? Oh hell , no that ai n't  happening here , miss . There is something called health codes and I 'm pretty sure that bowel movements and portable toilets do n't  fit into that equation .

At job number two , I serve cocktails and food during shows and on occasion we have a late show that starts at 11:30 PM . I especially dislike this shift because 11:30 is closer to the time I like to be leaving the job rather than just beginning it . <p> Its 10:45 and the 11:30 show has just been given " a go .

At the club , we do n't  normally get 21 year-olds . We cater to a more mature crowd who do not require carding because most of them had their birth certificates delivered via Pony Express and their drivers licenses were given to them for horse and buggies . <p> The young girl looks at the menu overwhelmed by either the selection or the $15 martini prices . <p> " Um , I du n no yet . Can I just start out with a chocolate mouse ? " <p> " Okay , one chocolate mousse , " I say . <p> " Oh my god , I meant mousse , not mouse . Oh my god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a Red Bull and vodka ' " she decides . <p> " Do you have i.d . for me ? " <p> She reaches into her bag which may or may not have had Dora the Explorer on it and hands me her license which confirms that she has been twenty-one years old for all of three months . I hand it back to her . " Thank you . I 'm sorry but we do n't  have Red Bull . " <p> If she did n't  see my eye roll then she must be blind because an epic eye roll it is . <p> " I 'm sorry , but we do n't  have any energy drinks . Is there something else I can get for you ? " <p> She seems to not quite comprehend what kind of place does n't  have Red Bull . Typically , I serve Manhattans , dry martinis and or an Old-Fashioned . We do not have energy drinks , nor do we have cotton candy flavored vodka or body shots . She finally decides on a Long Island Iced Tea because that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your buck . Vodka , gin , tequila and rum ? Perfect . The other girl orders a Coke since she now knows I will card her ass if she tries to order anything else . <p> The two girls continue to annoy me during the show because they do n't  want a second drink since they " are so broke . " They have to get something though so I order them each a $5.50 bottle of water . They are talking during the show , taking pictures of each other , texting friends and checking their Facebook . Not only am I at work later than I want to be , I am stuck serving kids who I know are going to leave shit for tips . I try my hardest to disguise my disdain for them .

I stand in the corner looking back and forth between them and the bottle of Chardonnay that I am not allowed to touch until the last customer has left . Finally , they leave . <p> " Good night , you guys . Thank you for coming in tonight . " Even I am surprised at how genuine it sounds . Seconds after they leave the club , I pour myself my shift drink and go pick up my tip : four dollars . It is now 1:40 AM and I made a total of $28 for the show . I would rather have left two and a half hours earlier without the money . <p> But now for the surprising part . So many people email me telling me what a horrible waiter I must be . They tell me I am rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a real job and that they would hate to ever be in my station . But this is how good of a waiter I am . I looked at Yelp a few days ago and saw a review for the night I just told you about . It reads : <p> We came here with a Groupon deal for admission to one of the late night ( post 11:30pm ) shows . Dessert was tasty , service was friendly and attentive ( even after he knew we had pre-purchased ) , and the show provided the sort of random and entertaining night that I love about NYC . I would definitely come back , but probably not at full price . <p> Even though I hated being there , hated my customer because I knew they were going to shaft me , I still gave them good service . That 's what makes a good server . Doing everything you can for your customer and never letting them know that you hate them with a passion . Am I a bitchy waiter ? Damn right , I am .

That said , I 've stopped saying " thank you " when I do n't mean it . I do n't get rude and my tone of voice may still be chipper and friendly but I 've started saying things like " Bye now " instead of the automatic " thank you " at the end . It may not be much , but it makes me feel better and slightly less of a fraud = <p> Serving is a lot of acting , and having self-control in not showing disappointment , anger etc . Anyone who does n't get this does n't make it far in the business . I know you 're a good server , because you obviously care . Why would you bother to blog about it otherwise ?

You know , since one sixteen year old girl asked me if I was in " that play " I am a total celeb ( in my delusional mind ) . <p> I hate waiting on celebrities . I havent had to do it very often because famous people do n't  usually come into the places that I sling hash .

He was really nice though and it was exciting to see someone from one of my stories . Several months ago Ivanka Trump came into VYNL where I was working at the time . Obviously , she was slumming or she wanted to see how poor people live because she came in to have an $8.99 omelet . I did n't  wait on her .

After the first time , do n't  you think the chef ( fry cook ) would actually time it to make sure it was really two minutes ? And then a third time ? And fourth time ? And a fifth ? Get real , lady . You ai n't  the Queen of England . Maybe the egg just did n't  taste right to her because her taste buds arenow fossils . Or maybe she secretly hated eggs because her last ovary fell out of her cooch back in the Roaring 20s .

I approached the table ready to write down Cosmopolitan , Dewars on the rocks , Amstel Lite or some other non-descript drink but I was taken for a loop instead . The man , with his deep voice and manly stubble thought long and hard about his beverage of choice .

Now he think he s Rita Hayworth ? I thought he was about to light up a cigarette , put it in a long black holder and saunter up to the piano to drape himself over it and sing a torch song . <p> Of course we had to look up the recipe for a Singapore Sling because it has n't  been made since Rita Hayworth made The Lady From Shanghai in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Tom the bartender .

" One Singapore Sling is my limit , " he said as he patted his chest . I offered my condolences to his girlfriend via sympathetic smile . As they left , I wondered how Miss OHara planned on getting home .

Anyone who feels confident writing a story about poop , gets an A+ in my book . Its a little short but really , how many words does one need when discussing poop ? We have all had our experiences with poopy diners but this story seems especially odorous. - -BW <p> I 'm a fresh face to the food service industry . Needless to say , the inner workings of a restaurant and the customer interactions have caught me off guard . Being a newbie , I often wonder in amazement , " does this happen at other restaurants ? " I encountered a customer last week who finally broke me into my bitchy waiter mentality . <p> Our restaurant is a small , locally owned establishment in rural Illinois . Its not amongst the highest rankings of fine dining establishments . However , we are probably the nicest joint around in Nowhere , Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the background and the bow-tie sporting servers , a man comes hustling in during our lunch hour . He zips past the host station and into our restroom . A busser ( sorry , " host assistant " ) makes the comment , " dude , something smells like straight up shit . " At the time , everyone was too busy to take too much notice but one by one we all hopped on the shitty band wagon of nose pinching delight . <p> Several minutes later , the smelly man comes out of the restroom and casually heads over to join his party . Now the stench has flooded our restroom area , located directly next to our server station . Another customer emerges from the badlands and promptly announces to us that she thought " a child may have had an accident " in our restroom . <p> The walls , toilet and floor were covered in poop as if a shit bomb terrorist was on the loose . It does n't  end there- we began to notice that there was fecal matter on the dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , the culprit himself was also covered in his own feces . It was on his back . To make matters worse , he notices another party who he knows personally , moves to their table and plops down in another chair . Now our bathroom , two chairs and our dining room floor are all tainted . Literally- HOLY SHIT ! ? The man never acknowledged his butthole vandalism , nor did his party or the other tables near by . Everyone just continued digging into their sundaes and chocolate crepes . His party even told our host that they were all considering returning that evening for desserts . <p> As I mentioned previously , I have n't been serving very long . Theoretically , I cant make the assumption that this incident is unique . Perhaps customers come along to other restaurants and shamelessly smear poop everywhere . Before you ponder the question , only because it seems to generally be everyones first question ; no , the man was not a senior citizen and nothing about him suggested any mental condition ( well , that 's up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had a shitty day serving tables ? <p> Someone had such a horrific intestinal apocalypse at one place where I worked that I thought the owner had replaced the white toilet with a brown one . I shit you not . The seat , the tank , the sides of the bowl , ALL of it was covered . There was only one restroom with one toilet on the first floor . Disgusting . We had to send everyone upstairs all night . No one informed the owner because we did n't  want to have to clean it up . Disgusting ! <p> Ive been in this business for 15 years and have seen a lot of crazy stuff being a bartenderhad to clean up puke numerous times , etc but someone actually shitting all over themselves is a new one to me . Welcome to the industry ! <p> This happens ! Or at least it happened to me too . One day a guy came in who appeared to be mentally disadvantaged . He went into the restroom and was in there for several minutes , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny alcove right off the dining room so not much of a buffer . There began to be a smell . I asked my ( male ) manager to maybe go take a look , make sure the guy was okay . He peeked in head into the restroom . The dude was NAKED and covered in shit . The walls , floor , and toilet were ALSO covered in shit . We called the cops , who showed up at about the same time the guys caretakers walked in looking for him . I do n't  know where they had been or how he got away from them , but the cops made them clean up the mess . <p> An almost identical story happened in our locally owned restaurant here not too long ago : The worst smell ever was floating around and I told my boss about it and he said they must be cleaning the grease traps next door . " Well it smells like shit . " " Yea , they do smell pretty bad . " Another ten minutes later I notice it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dribbles of poop leading to the mens room . I go back and tell him again and he thinks i 'm half kidding and half getting a reaction out of him and gets irritated . " NO , REALLY . ITS SHIT .

I cant say who and just so you ca n't figure it out all I 'm going to say is he ran against Nixon in 72 . <p> Oh BW , I love you . I was a server before I got my job in a grocery store ( same shit , except I get rid of the customers quicker ) . I can relate to a lot of these posts . <p> My friend and I work in the same store . She came to me with this horrible look on her face and said " DO NOT USE THE DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM " Apparently she had to pee and there was a short wait . Two stalls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said she took one step in the stall and turned right back around because it was covered in poo . She said it looked like someone bent straight over and fired poop out of their butt , all over the toilet , the wall , and the floor . At this point , the other stall became available so she went in and did her business . The lady in the stall next to her was making some horrible bathroom sounds and she wanted to get out of there fast to avoid the wave of stink that was coming next . <p> Then , as she was washing her hands , she saw the lady in the next stall ( the one making the horrible sounds ) quickly exit the stall and slip into the stall that my friend had just come out of . She found that a little odd and as she was leaving the bathroom , she happened to glance at the stall that the lady had just come out of because the door was open . It was covered in shit , just like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the only non-poopy stall . Presumably doing the same damage that she had done to the other two stalls . <p> That 's bad .. but this weekend we had a woman ( who was not eating at the restaurant just needed to use the restroom ) shit in my section , another girls section and all the way to the bathroom . She clearly could n't hold it . Parents were sniffing diapers until all at once all of us looked at the floor . It was horrible . The lady who left the parting gift , walked right out of the restaurant like nothing happened and never told a soul Not that we could miss it with that smell . <p> Now , I have to admit , I am a server at Olive Garden . I know , I know . But every Sunday , a gentlemen comes into the restaurant at noon . He ( let 's name him Steve ) is a rather large guy and the hosts are required to keep " his table " open for him , no matter how busy we are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is questionable what many of them are from . Steve also always has the worst body odor surrounding him . The air in the path he takes as he walks from the front of the restaurant to his seat is permeated by the stench for what seems like hours . Steves table also remains un-sat for at least an hour after he leaves . I have been his server on multiple occasions and I am always forced to breathe in the clean air at the side station before making my way to his table . This seems like a rant . Well , my point is that the entire restaurant and our guests are effected by this guy . There should be a policy in all restaurants ( chain or otherwise ) where the managers can ask people to leave if they are disrupting others by their appearance ; smells @ that service ? Thanks !

@@106055360 @1455360/ <h> " Celebrity " Caught Yelling at Waitress ( video ) <p> So I guess that in the Twin Cities , there is a radio personality named Dave Ryan . I have never heard of him because I am not in the habit of listening to morning radio shows while driving to a job in the Minneapolis-St . Paul area , but he is pretty well-known there . There is a video out today that shows him treating a server like crap and I ca n't tell if it 's real or not . I mean , it seems legit and he comes across like a big scabby douchebag who belittles his waitress because he feels he waited too long for a drink . On the other hand , the video is being shared on his official Facebook page which makes me think one of two things : <p> The whole video was a set-up meant to go viral . <p> He truly is a big scabby douchebag and he does n't care that the world knows about it . <p> Supposedly , the video was shared by someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super secret surveillance video when she saw what was going down . The two men who are with Dave look extremely uncomfortable when he starts harassing the waitress , but maybe they were playing for the camera . Watch it for yourself and you tell me what you think . <p> If the video is real , then I think we can all safely assume that Dave Ryan is a complete jackass who has let celebrity go to his head . The server deserves a fucking gold medal for not losing her shit with this asshole and dumping a pitcher of ice water into his lap and poking him in the eye with a fork . If it 's fake , then I just helped him get more attention <p> Here is his Facebook pageif you want to go tell him your thoughts about the way he treated the waitress . Also tell him I said hello . <p> That audio is way too clear to not have him micd . Even if he was talking loud , there wouldve been background noise muffling his voice , but you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant . Seems like a planned bit . <p> Once he yelled about not getting water , any server would have said " I 'm sorry , I 'll be right back with it " and left to go get it . She just stood there waiting to be berated some more . I call " fake " . But for what purpose escapes me . <p> Not sure this is n't a set up for attention but if it was n't he s an ass . Yeah , we all mess up . We miss tables/customers . Were humans not robots . I am thankful we have managers ( at least at the moment ) that I know will back me up . All I 'd have said to that dude is , " I apologize , I missed your table . Let me get the manager so we can fix it . " There is nothing else you can do with a guy like this .

Not a bad guy , just a backfired prank . <p> If the video is true ( BTW the link is blocked ) whatever little fame he had will work against him now , if is fake then he ca n't be that famous if the answer to get ratings is by faking a video in which he has to belittle an individual who works in the food and beverage industry .

Do I need to say anything more about them ? <p> Table number three wanted a Dewars and water , but not too strong . I gave her a rocks glass filled with Dewars and water just like she asked and I put extra water in it so the glass was pretty full . " Is there water in that ? " Yes . " Are you sure ?

Surely I had made a mistake and added something extra to their check because there was no way that four people could spend that much in such a short amount of time . I looked at the check .

It . <p> Starting at the bar , I was overwhelmed with options for my starter drink . They all looked so good . I laughed to the bartender , " Can I just have a taste of every single one ? " The bartender clearly had no sense of humor because he just rolled his eyes and said no . Or maybe he did have a sense of humor but was in an understandably shitty mood since it was 8:00 PM on Christmas Eve and he has to make cocktails for an alcoholic bitch like me . I meant to write down the name of every drink but I assured myself I would remember the name and all the ingredients in them as well . Fail . My first was called something like a chili citrus martini and it made my face melt off with deliciousness . I do recall that it had Citrus Vodka , Limoncello and hot peppers muddled in it . It was so freaking good . After the first sip , I thought it was too spicy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after sip number ten I was just said that it was gone . Go there . Order it .

Again , I forgot what it was called and even what was in it . Vodka , I know that . Cocktail number three was called Thom and was citrus vodka with fresh mint . Again , it was perfection . Of course at this point they could have served me leftover dog drool with a garnish and I would have been happy . The food was divine as well . Crispy rock shrimp and coconut chicken in lettuce wraps gave me a Thai boner as my apps and for dinner I took a virtual bath in the green curry . Dessert was the flourless chocolate cake .

The turnover is high meaning the level of service is never where it should be . Maybe if they kept me , it could have gotten better . <p> But I was fired . Or let go . It was huge blessing for me , because I was not happy there . However , if I quit , I would not be eligible for unemployment . Seeing that they let me go for their own reasons and not because I did something wrong ( like anonymously discuss a place I work while never mentioning the name of the restaurant or the name of anyone I worked with ) , I simply reopen my unemployment claim and find the next job . A job that wo n't mind working around a schedule . Au revoir , " new job . " It was fun . Actually , it was n't fun . At all . That place gave me the shivers every time I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work yesterday that both entertained me and horrified me at the same time . No , Holly Hobbie did not finally release the lemon that has been stuck up her ass . In fact , I think the lemon has been joined by citrus friends orange , pineapple and grapefruit along with a bottle of Cabernet . Bitch has a fucking sangria party happening up in her poop chute . I was standing near my station when I saw a woman rushing to the bathroom . She had a white creamy liquid dripping off her face and hands and her blouse was also covered with it . Next I saw a waitress following her with a linen napkin held out in front of her that was also dripping the same questionable substance . " Hmmm , " I thought . " Did Lispy Gay Manager just have a party with his friends ? " I looked in the direction from whence they came and saw some back waiters mopping the floor and people milling about . I then figured that someone had dropped one of the delicious organic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting nearby . Sucks to have smoothie all over you , right ? If only it was smoothie . <p> When the waitress came out of the bathroom of course I got my nosy ass all up in her face and asked her what happened . " Oh nothing . This lady just threw up , that 's all . " That 's all ? Hello no , that 's not all . I want details . Did the food make her puke ? Did Linda Evans say hello and the very sight of the double face piercing make this woman projectile vomit ? Did she get a whiff of Lispy Gays cologne ? The waitress told me that the lady was pregnant and simply threw up . My next question was this : " And did you clean it up with that napkin ? " Had it been me , and I saw a lady throw up in my station , she would have been up vomit creek without a barf bag , because my ass ai n't  helping with that shit . If I helped , then thered be two people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to explain that she was the oldest of about a dozen children and she grew up around pregnant women so she saw what was about to happen . " So I grabbed a napkin and tried to catch it . " That 's right , this Wonder Waitress caught the vomit . It was at this point I noticed there was a chunk of leftover vomit on her right shoulder . After it was pointed out to her , she laughed and went to the sink and rinsed it off with a wet paper towel . I resisted the urge to gag . <p> I never did see the lady come out of the bathroom . I presume she exited through the window because she was so completely ashamed about puking all over herself while a waitress tried to catch it in a fucking dinner napkin . She must have slunk her pregnant ass home and prescribed bed rest for her remaining pregnancy . Maybe after the baby is born she will be able to put this episode behind her . They say that all the pain of child birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hopefully , this too will be erased from her memory . If only it could be erased from mine . 109837 @qwx969837 <p> Maybe you have heard that I have a new job and that it sucks big hairy donkey balls that have been shaved with a rusty razor . The restaurant is well-known and celebrities seem to flock to the place . In my short week there , I have seen famous chef Wolfgang Puck , famous lesbian finance guru Suze Orman and world renown pop star Katy Perry . I served Katy Perry on my first day out of training . As if your first day out of training is n't stressful enough , I have to have the managers breathing down my neck to make sure I cater to the every whim of Katy Perry . As it turns out , she was polite , friendly , sweet , down to earth , kind and patient . All the things that my managers are not . <p> When she sat down with her circle of five friends , I decided I would treat her just like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . Because that 's what she is . A person . Who eats food . The table ordered and then Katy ( I call her Katy , because were close like that. ) asked if we had mashed potatoes . " Um , I know we do for dinner , but I have feeling that we wont have them this early in the day . Lemme check and I 'll let you know , okay ? " I went up to manager Holly Hobbie and another manager who I have not written about yet ( long story short : she 's a bitch too . ) " I have a table that wants mashed potatoes . Do we have those for lunch ? " " No , " said Holly Hobbie . " Oh , okay , because Katy Perry was asking- " Other Manager interrupted me . " Oh , is it for Katy Perry ? Katy Perry wants mashed potatoes ? I will go ask the kitchen if they can make mashed potatoes for Katy Perry since Katy Perry wants mashed potatoes . " She zoomed off as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her glasses slide down her nose and said , " In the future ? You should always say ? Katy Perry wants mashed potatoes . " ( I do n't  know why so many of these managers say everything as a question , but they do . ) Got it . So the next time anyone at lunch asks for mashed potatoes , I should say Katy Perry wants mashed potatoes . Other Manager came back from the kitchen looking like she had just had her stomach punched , completely defeated . " We do n't  have any mashed potatoes . Youll have to tell Katy Perry we do n't  have them . I tried , but the chef just does n't  have them . We would try to do it for Katy Perry if we could . Now if Joe Schmo wanted potatoes then " I finished her sentence for her . " No potato for Joe Schmo ! " I laughed and turned to walk back to my station . Other Manager called at me to return . With dead seriousness she said , " I 'm serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was for real . <p> I went back to my dear personal friend Katy to break the bad news to her . " Yeah , just as I suspected we only have mashed potatoes at dinner and they 're just not ready yet . " And how do you think Miss Katy Perry responded ? Like a normal person , she said , " Oh , okay . That 's totally cool . Just fries then . " I always thought I liked that Katy Perry chick and now I know for sure . Shes cool . I want to send her a big tub of mashed potatoes from KFC just to say thank you for being a friend . <p> Click here to follow The Bitchy Waiter blog .

@@106055368 @1455368/ <h> Category Archives : Bad News Bears <p> Do you know what a platitude is ? According to the final and foremost authority on everything in the world , Wikipedia , a platitude is " a trite , meaningless , biased , or prosaic statement often presented as if it were significant and original . " In other words , its that tired old saying that you hear over and over again that was n't even funny or interesting the first time you heard it . We all someone who throws out these statement one right after the other , do n't  we ? You know that guy ? I work with that guy . He talks like he learned English from reading inspirational posters at a Hallmark shop in the mall . He s a nice guy , but just once I wish he would say something that was n't first said by a kitten hanging from a tree limb . He calls me " brother " too . I do n't  like that . I have two brothers and they are free to call me brother anytime they like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we have the same parents , ergo , we are brothers . The line cook with the greasy face and greasier hair is not my brother . In other words , when I say to him , " Man , its really busy tonight , " he should not respond with , " hang in there , brother , hang in there . " Here are some other nuggets of joy he has dispensed to me as he hands me an overcooked burger that I rang in as medium rare : <p> One time I brought him a cup of coffee that he asked for and he said , " You 're the best , I do n't  care what anyone else says . " ( Followed by a laugh because that is so funny . ) <p> When I get to work and ask " hows it going ? ' " he always answers with " So far so good , but the night is young .

" <p> Whenever he says thank you he follows it with " you are a gentleman and a scholar . " <p> When we run out of the special and it is replaced with something else , he tells me we must " go with the flow , my man , go with the flow . " <p> " Its all good " is my least favorite saying that anyone can say . It has become a catch all response for almost anything . Running late ? Too hot in the kitchen ? Rang in the wrong appetizer ? " Its all good , my brother . " <p> Once he actually said he does n't  like to assume anything because that makes an ASS out of U and ME . Yeah , that was hilarious when Walter Matthau said in in 1977 in The Bad News Bears . Today ?

@@106055369 @1455369/ <h> Category Archives : cigarette breaks <p> I do n't  smoke cigarettes . Never have , never will . Growing up , my dad always smoked and it was the first thing I would smell in the morning when my alarm would go off , his cigarette smoke as he sat in the kitchen reading the newspaper , drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette . Nowadays , he would never consider smoking inside the house but back then no one seemed to think much about it . It was sorta the way that we thought it was perfectly fine to sunbathe with baby oil and throw litter outside our car windows as we drove down the highway . Ah , it was a simple world back then . Over the years , I have been in a couple of plays that required me to smoke cigarettes but it was always so disgusting that it never made me want to consider continuing the habit after closing night . Nope , cigarettes are not something I ever wanted to take up until last last night when I noticed that the bartender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of our five hour shift while I was stuck inside working . <p> Surely I am not the only one who notices this reverse discrimination . Yes , smokers have been delegated to one square foot where they are allowed to puff and it has to be so many feet from the building entrance and then they are not allowed to throw their butts on the ground , ( Speaking of butts ) but they do get to leave their jobs several times a day to do it . Its not fair for those of us with clean lungs , longer life expectancy and more spending money . Observe : <p> Smoker:Hey boss , I 'm gon na go out to the sidewalk and have a quick cigarette break for a few minutes and I 'll be right back , okay ? <p> Boss : Okay . <p> Non-smoker:Hey boss , I 'm gon na go out to the sidewalk for a few minutes and I 'll be right back , okay ? <p> Boss:Are you gon na smoke a cigarette ? <p> Non-smoker:No , I do n't  smoke so I 'm just gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ass back to work . <p> You know its true . Smokers have this unspoken permission to run out for a quick smoke break any time they want and while they 're out there they get to other things that we non-smokers are not allowed to do at our jobs like talk on the phone or look at a magazine . Man.smokers have all the fun . Maybe people allow them to do it because they feel sorry for the chain of addiction that is wrapped around the smokers lungs and they know that for every cigarette they smoke that person is losing eleven minutes of their lives . But I want my four or five mini breaks a day , goddamn it . I knew this guy once who was from Hungary . He told me that every man there had to serve in the army as a teenager and he soon realized that the smokers in the army got several sanctioned breaks throughout the day . So what did he do ? He bought a pack of cigarettes and started to smoke . Actually , he would simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from whatever the others were doing . It was the army in Hungary so who the hell knows what that was . Push ups ? Breaking rocks ? Eating goulash ? The point is that even in the Hungarian army , smokers got to take breaks that non-smokers did n't  . <p> Its time that we non-smokers stood up for our rights ! The next time you are at work and you see one of your filthy addicted co-workers going out to suck on a cancer stick for five minutes , I say go with them . ( Do not stand too close to them though because you do n't  want any of that nasty ass second-hand smoke to get into your beautiful pure lungs . ) If a person goes out to smoke once an hour during a five hour shift , that totals about twenty-five minutes of free time they get that non-smokers do n't  . Never mind that by smoking five cigarettes they have shaved off almost an hour of their life , we are talking about short term benefits here . We deserve those cigarette breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em . Starting tomorrow , any time someone goes out for a " quick puff , " I 'm going too . I 'm going to buy me some of those candy cigarettes though because smoking is not cool . I just want to be lazy . <p> Does anyone else see this happen at their job ? I want to know .

Tonight I went to dinner at Essex Bar &amp; Bistro with all my besties for Lele 's birthday and I swear to God , it was basically awful . I mean , the food was good and everything , but our waiter was like , totally lame . Like , we asked him to take a photo of us and he could n't even do that right . Like , oh my God , who ca n't take a picture with an iPhone ? How dumb do you have to be ? By the way , my Daddy bought me the new iPhone 7 in Rose Gold and it is almost as beautiful as I am . Almost . Ha ha ! The waiter was n't very good at his job which does not surprise me at all . Like , I asked for four lemon wedges and he just brought me a bowl of them and I counted only three . Umm , I asked for four ! And then , when I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have one . Dafuq ? In this day and age , every restaurant should have a gluten-free menu . So then I asked him what I could eat there and he told me that it was my job to know what I could and could n't have if I was avoiding gluten . How rude ! Anyways , I ordered the mushroom flatbread and it was so yummy . Since he could n't be bothered to give me a gluten-free menu , I hope that the crust did n't have any wheat in it . If it did , welp , there goes my diet ! Ha ha ! I also ordered the Essex Ginger Berry cocktail , but asked for it with no ginger and instead of vodka I had tequila . And instead of a martini glass I asked for it in a regular glass . Frozen . With a sugar rim . He seemed all irritated with me , but whatever . Anyways , we asked him to take our picture like ten times . He always acted like he was so busy and could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doing things for them like filling their water and carrying out their food and stuff like that there . Umm , hello ? ? If I 'm tipping you 10% then you need to do what I say , alright ? Finally , he took a picture of us and it was so bad . Like Lisa 's head was cut off and you could n't even see that I had just gotten my highlights done this week . We asked him to take another one and it sucked too . The lighting was bad . So we asked for another and this time Ashley had her eyes closed . So we asked him to take one more and he basically told us he was too busy . Welp , there goes his tip ! So I was forced to take a selfie because I wanted to check in on Facebook . His photography skills were about on par with his serving skills . ( That 's what I wrote on Facebook too . Sick burn , right ? ) Anyway , diary , I had a fun night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to take a photography class or something . It would be really helpful for people like me who lost their selfie stick . And waiters are supposed to be there to do stuff for us like wipe up the table when I spill my drink , sweep under the table when I drop my bread and take a picture of me when I need it . Happy birthday , Lele ! ! Sorry about the crappy photo of your special night . Waiters suck . <p> Love , Jessalyn <p> ( This may or may not be an actual entry from her diary . We can not be certain . ) <p> My favourite is when they hand me their phone and say " now , you just hold it like this and press this little round dot " .

Someone reached into the cavity of my chest and pulled out my still-beating heart and threw it onto the floor and stepped on it as if it were a day old Dunkin Donut that deserved no kindness . I would cry , but my eyes have leaked to the point of exhaustion and there is nothing left to weep . You have heard of the dry heaves ? Im having a serious case of dry cries . I want to cry , but there is only sawdust , Goldfish salt and resentment in my tear ducts . What horror has befallen me ? Brace yourselves . Seriously , lean your ass up against a wall before you read this , because the earth shall quake and the heavens will roar with anger . At my job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly type this .

How am I expected to not strangle table 6 if there is no glass of pinot grigio to reward me for not committing murder , assault or manslaughter ? How will I numb the pain of separating the check for three ladies who each ordered the same exact thing and each gave me a credit card , yet still demanded that I create an individual check for each of them ? The only way I could handle that shit was knowing that at least at the end of the night there would be a libation with my name on it . The humanity ! <p> I understand the thought behind this . I do .

@@106055375 @1455375/ <h> Category Archives : cancer sucks <p> Well , file this under " warming the cockles of my tired black heart . " A reader named Whitney sent me an email explaining that a woman came into her station recently and asked for a quiet booth away from people . She then ordered a bottle of Merlot , spinach dip and worked on her laptop for the duration of the afternoon . <p> At this point , most of us servers with hardened attitudes are beginning to grumble things like , " If you do n't  want to be around people , then do n't  come into a restaurant " and " Great . Thanks for using my table as your office all day and not letting me turn the table over even one damn time . " <p> When the lady left , there was a note on the table along with a twenty dollar tip . The note said : <p> Thank you . I found out that I have cancer today . And I needed a quiet place to sit and work . Remember what 's important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankful . Even for the shitty stuff . Take care and thank you for letting me sit here.p.s . Sorry if any customers were offended- I did n't  realize my ear buds werent working right and blared Prince for a while . Oh well . <p> What can we learn from this , folks ? We can learn a few things , the least of which is that a cancer diagnosis cries out for spinach dip and Merlot . If it were me , I 'd probably be more of a nachos and margaritas or Pepsi and Butterfingers kind of guy , but you say potato and I say potato . ( That saying does n't  really work when typing it , does it ? ) We also learn that the musical stylings of Prince soothe the soul when one is down . What we really learn is almost a repeat of what I was trying to write about last week : be grateful . I suppose when you are told that you have cancer , then even the " shitty stuff " is better than the alternative , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when my Mamo Rita would catch herself complaining about being old and realize that being old is better than being dead . I know that couple of my posts lately have been less about the bitchy and more about something else , but maybe 2013 is trying to remind me that waiting tables can give me extraordinary experiences and not just shitty ones . Besides , the letter is teaching me to be grateful for the shitty ones anyway . <p> As servers , I guess we have to be aware that , like it or not , we are affecting the lives of our customers , sometimes in a completely insignificant way but other times maybe quite a bit . Whitney was nice to to this woman without even knowing that at that moment , she needed kindness more than ever . What if Whitney had told her something like , " I 'm sorry , but I need to turn this table over so maybe you can go to Starbucks with your computer ? " Whitney , unknowingly , gave the woman exactly what she needed that day which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitney also gave the woman something else : kindness . Could it be that more of our customers want that from us than we think ? Perhaps they are coming into our stations making demands and spouting off their needs but in reality they are crying out for a shoulder to cry on . Okay , probably not . More than likely , that woman who yelled at me last week about her burger being overcooked was in fact just a true bitch and not reaching out for kindness . Maybe she needed a lesson in gratitude and to be reminded to be thankful for the " shitty stuff " or in her case , a medium-well burger instead of a medium-rare one . <p> My point is , I guess we all have to be nice to our customers with the assumption that they are dependent on kindness to get them through their day . Maybe our job is more than carrying food to someone . Could it be that our job is to make sure people leave our station in a better mood than they were in when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waxing poetic simply because I chose to have two mimosas for breakfast this morning and my fingers are typing drunk words ? Either way , I suppose that kindness is something we should aspire to have and give . <p> But back to the woman who wrote the note : Isnt is nice of her that on the very first day she has been diagnosed with cancer , rather than wallowing in her own misery , she made the decision to immediately start teaching others how to take full advantage of the life they have ? I wish all good things for this mystery diner . I hope she makes a full recovery and that she has plenty of time to blare Prince all she wants . And thank you to Whitney for sending the photo so we can know that sometimes our customers need more than spinach dip or a bottle of Merlot . Sometimes they just need a friendly smile and a thoughtful hello . We can do that , cant we ? 109839 @qwx969839

I know all about giving grades since I was a substitute teacher at a high school in Western Massachusetts a few years ago ( Holla out to Southwick ! ) Yes , I had the future of our country in the palm of my hand . I was one cool fucking sub . When someone told me they did n't  want to do their homework , I told them it was totally acceptable if they did n't  want to do it ? " Really , Mr. C ? I do n't  have to do it ? Cool ! " " That 's right , " I responded . " All homework I give to you is optional . If you choose not to do it , it is your grade that is affected , not mine .

Anyone who knows me knows how utterly ridiculous that is . When I was in high school myself , I did whatever it took to get out of that shit . One year I worked in the library and another year I worked in the office and my senior year I managed to be the school mascot so that cheerleading class would count as my P.E . credit . Had I a vagina , I would have claimed to have a four year menstrual cramp .

" Mr. C. , we do n't  wan na be out here , " they whined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No get out there , pull an Olivia Newton-John and get physical .

" That 's the new score keeper , " I decreed . " Play on ! " <p> The highlight of my subbing career , was when a class walked in and one student said " Aww man , we have a sub " and another student said , " Hey , its Mr. C. He s cool .

I could offer educational nuggets like : <p> When you swipe a credit card , read the name on it so you can acknowledge them personally when you get back to their table . People love that personal shit . <p> Compliment the behavior of a child at the table even though it just took a dump on the floor . " You have a very well behaved child " is like crack for parents . <p> If you make a mistake , fess up to it so that your customer will see you as honest and hardworking rather than the bitter self-loathing bitch you truly are . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill and then tell the customer that it was on you because they were the nicest table you had all night . Invariably , they will throw you a few extra bucks and the only one who loses any money is the restaurant itself because you gave away free liquor but who gives a shit about that anyway ? <p> Smile . Even if you have to sew your fucking lips to the your ears , smile because no one wants to see a grumpy ass waiter . Save the scowl for the sidestand and after they leave . <p> So there you have it . My true gift for teaching shines through even when it comes to discussing the horrible field of waiting tables . But seriously , Andrew , that email you sent me was crap .

@@106055385 @1455385/ <h> A Comment on Comments ; the " You Suck " Edition <p> Each and every time I reach into my skull to pull out my brain in order to wring out a blog post , I hope to engage the reader with what I write . I always encourage people to leave a comment or to send me an email so that I can know if I have been successful or not. - A rather mundane post from a few days ago in which I bemoaned the fact that the restaurant I work in does n't  accept American Express seems to have especially affected at least one person who sent me an email. - His name is JS and his email address is an AOL one which leads me to believe that he used an old email account to write to me . Perhaps he did that because his current email has his real name attached to it and he does n't  want me to know who he is . I am half tempted to give out the email address since he more than likely does n't  use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would like to say hello to him , but I wo n't do that because that would irresponsible . Well , I probably wo n't do that . I du n no , maybe I will. - Anyway , this is what he wrote to me that has caused me to feel the need to publicly reply : <p> You try so hard , really you do . But you mean 80s and 90s pop music , not 80s and 90s . Your " bitchy-put-upon shtick " is really lame and not cool like you think . You should invest more money in learning to write and edit and do n't  quit your day job , ever . You suck at writing like you surely suck at waiting tables . The world owes you nothing and were all sick of the woe is me attitude . Fuck off ! <p> Actually , JS , I do try so hard , I really do . You think its easy to write a blog for almost 7 years when the only topic of the blog can be about waiting tables ? Its extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this blog is repetitive as hell since there are only so many ways one can write the same ten complaints over and over again . Honestly , me complaining about children in my station is like beating a dead horse . Albeit , I 'm beating that dead horse with a baby that I snatched from Table 2 , but still . If you are upset about where the apostrophes were placed when I was describing music from the decades of 1980 and 1990 , I have to wonder what kind of sad fucking life you live . Did you honestly log in to an email account that you hardly ever use just to complain about that ? You probably had to create a new password and everything just to make sure that I knew how unhappy you were with my apostrophe placement . Well , I did a little bit of research and have discovered that the apostrophe can go in either place , so your argument is invalid . I would suggest that you take those apostrophes and shove them up your asshole . In all actuality , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your ass without any problem whatsoever so I see your apostrophes and I raise you two exclamation points , a question mark , three asterisks and an ampersand . Your hungry hungry hippo asshole will gobble up those punctuation marks so greedily that when it swallows them up it will probably ask for a couple of semicolons for dessert . <p> As for your belief that my " bitchy-put-upon shtick is really lame and not cool " like I think , I am going to have to disagree with you on that one . My Facebook page gains between 900 and 1300 new " likes " each week so there are some people out there who would probably disagree with you as well . If you want to believe that its lame , then you go right ahead , but do n't  be a dick- about it . I know you 're not alone in disliking this blog , but there are plenty of people who do like it . Do n't  like it ? Do n't  read it . <p> When you suggest that I invest more money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken impression that I must have spent some money to learn to write and edit . I have n't . All this sub-par writing is completely self taught and I have no plans to quit my day job at this time . Once my book comes out in April of 2016 I will then consider cutting down on my shifts . You see , contrary to your opinion , an agent liked my writing enough to send my manuscript to Sterling Publishing who liked my writing enough to buy it and pay me money for it . In fact , I 've already received 50% of my advance check and it is in my bank account right this very minute . You might think I suck at writing , but someone else does n't  and that someone else had money to back it up . As for waiting tables , you do n't  know whether I suck or not but my boss , who knows about my " other career " and is probably reading this very blog post , does not think I suck at waiting tables . I suppose this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years and every time one of my customers leaves me a 20-25% tip , I can only assume that they too think I do n't  suck at waiting tables . Until you have sat in my section and I brought out your wrong food , spilled a drink on you and then made you wait ten minutes for your check , you cant really form a valid option , can you ? <p> I agree that the world owes me nothing which is why this blog is free and I do n't  expect anyone to do anything with it other than read it if they choose to . You yourself read it , did n't  you ? Thank you for the click on the website because you were one of the 190,452 views of the page over the last thirty days and that makes me think there are lots of people who are not sick of the " woe is me attitude .

Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe there will be room in your colon for something else like a tray jack , a pitcher of water , a fajita skillet and a big fucking stack of dessert menus .

@@106055386 @1455386/ <h> Category Archives : Applebees <p> This is a prayer for some cheap bitches at Applebees who went to Facebook page to complain . Please read this aloud as if you are a Baptist televangelist on the PTL Club . If you ca n't do that , I have embedded a video of me doing it for you . It 's below . <p> Everyone please grabs hands and let 's start a prayer circle for two people who went to Applebee 's and got upset because they did n't get something for free . I know it 's hard to believe that a corporate restaurant would be so greedy with their money , but what 's even harder to believe is that some people think they are entitled to free food . Poor , poor Pearl just wanted some free bread or rolls to go with her Triple Bacon burger , is that too much to ask ? Apparently , at Applebee 's , it is . If only Jesus was there to multiply the loaves of bread , then maybe , just maybe , she could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drive over to a bakery to get Pearl some bread , please . I can only hope that Pearl made it through her dinner and was able to get past the horrific lack of free bread on the table . <p> And while we say our prayers for Pearl , let us not forget Richard . Dear , sweet , cheap ass , Richard who wanted some sour cream on his quesadillas but refused to pay $.75 for it . Richard must have forgotten that sour cream does not grow on tress and even if it did , Applebee 's still might charge him for it . It 's food , Richard and food is not free . The only thing that 's free in this world is love , unless you are paying a lady of the evening for her time in which case love is very , very expensive . But not as expensive as sour cream . Lord , please watch over Richard as he walks back to his car and drives all the way to Uno 's , using way more than $.75 worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sour cream . And please be with him when he gets to Uno 's and learns that they do n't even have quesadillas on their menu . <p> Oh it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a Facebook post to tatters , to very rags , to spilt the ears of the admins , who , for the most part , are capable of nothing but dumb shows and 20% off coupons . <p> Let us pray that Pearl and Richard have found peace , bread and sour cream . <p> We all need to take a moment out of our very busy day to acknowledge the trying times that Melly is going through . As I was scanning the Applebee 's Facebook page trying to find something that would inspire me to write yet another stupid blog post , I came across Melly 's comment and it stopped me in my tracks . All of us have experienced difficulty in our lives , but Melly 's ordeal is unlike any I have ever heard of . We must organize a prayer circle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she tries to make sense of this world she now lives in : Applebee 's no longer has potatoe skins or chicken sizzleing fajitas ! <p> What the fuck is wrong with you , Applebee 's ? You can have beef sizzleing fajitas , but not chicken sizzleing fajitas ? That makes absolutely no sense ! How are people like Melly supposed to wrap their head around that decision ? It was bad enough when you yanked potatoe skins off the menu , prying them from Melly 's hands like they were one of Meryl Streep 's babies in Sophie 's Choice . Melly was able to still manage to get to Applebee 's at least three times a month , but with this whole chicken sizzleing fajitas debacle , you have gone too far ! You have pushed Melly down the plank and she has been forced to jump off it and land at TGIFriday 's . The shame , Applebee 's , the shame ! <p> Here is what you must do to win Melly back : bring back these menu items and do it now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Melly 's Sizzleing Chicken Potoatoe Skins Fajitas and just to sweeten the pot , you should add some of your Applebee 's Riblets in there too . And instead of tortillas , you should serve them in a waffle cone drizzled with chocolate syrup and topped with whipped cream , but not fresh whipped cream , just the kind from a can . And you should let Melly eat these for free , not just three times a month , but three times a week ! What other option do you have , Applebee 's ? Do you honestly want her to go to TGIFriday 's and gorge herself on Endless Apps ? No ! No . You . Do n't . <p> Melly , I am here for you . I hope that my plea to the God 's of Applebee 's hear my prayers and resolve this issue for you . You deserve more than this crass treatment from a restaurant that you love so much . In the meantime , you are in my thoughts . I only wish I was with you to give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf lettuce and call you My Lil ' Potsticker . Be strong , Melly . Be strong . <p> First you take potatoe skins off the menu .. Now you take off the chicken sizzleing fajitas You have beef sizzleing <p> I always considered my childhood a good one . I had two loving parents and two younger brothers and I remember being a happy child . It turns out my youth was not as idyllic as I thought , because not once was I ever given booze by a waitress who was n't paying attention . Man , my childhood sucked . Well , everything old is new again , because we have reports of yet another child getting drunk on the sweet nectar . If its not a drunk ass baby The Olive Garden then its a drunk ass baby at Applebees . <p> A restaurant in Clearwater , Florida is the latest establishment to be all trendy by serving liquor to a child . Two moms took their kids on a Mothers day outing to a place called Frenchys South Beach Cafe . The kids had earned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a virgin strawberry daiquiri . The waitress hit the wrong button on the computer and the next thing they knew , two four year olds were partying like rock stars at Club Med . One of them drank the whole daiquiri in ten minutes which says two things : number one , frozen daiquiris are the bomb and number two , this kid a has a real future as a lush . The other child did not drink his which says one of two things : either the kid was holding out for a Guinness or the moms only ordered one strawberry daiquiri and they are saying that both kids drank them so the story sounds all that much more dramatical . Looking at the receipt , I only see one strawberry daiquiri , so " I 'll go with moms being all dramatical , for a thousand Alex . " <p> Shortly after though , one kid " started acting a little strange , falling asleep , stumbling over things then he started vomiting . " Damn four year olds , cant ever hold their liquor . The child was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably like , " Yes a four year old should not be drinking daiquiris . I would suggest starting out with something like a wine cooler or maybe a gin and tonic . Also , it helps if they drink plenty of water as they go on their alcohol binge and always follow it up with a banana and an aspirin . " <p> No charges are expected to be filed against the restaurant or the waitress since it was pretty clear that this was an accident and there was no intention to get a kid trashed on Mothers Day . The moms , understandably , want some kind of system in place so this does n't  " happen to another child , where they die , " said one overly dramatic mom . Its called " plastic cups , " people . That way you know that nothing alcoholic ever goes into plastic , kids never have a glass that might have alcohol in it and it also means when the kid knocks that shit over ( and they will ) the glass wont break . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happened all the time and thanks to videos and stories " going viral " we just hear about it more often now . Either way , its my cue to go to Party City and buy myself a baby costume and head right over to my nearest Olive Garden , Applebees or Frenchys South Beach cafe and order a smoothie and keep my fingers crossed that it will show up as a cocktail but they will only charge me the non-alcoholic beverage price . <p> There is a vicious Internet rumor going around that the days of waiters and waitresses are numbered . We could be as extinct as the dinosaur , the dodo bird or Whitney Houstons vocal chords . According to a CNN article , the newest craze in the restaurant world are tablets that allow customers to place their own orders that will be sent directly to the kitchen thus eliminating the need a for a real live human server to talk to you . I assume these tablets do not require tips . According to the article , the tablets also provide games to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even accept payment . Does this mean that my career is soon over ? Twenty restaurants on the West Coast ( rumored to be Applebees ) will be implementing these tablets soon . I guess if it takes off , then the tablets will sweep across the country rendering my ass out of job within a few months . But wont customers miss the warm personal interaction that they receive from a human being ? This brings up many concerns : <p> Customers can not ask a tablet for its personal opinion on the special soup of the day . Will a tablet tell you that the creamy spinach soup tastes like ass ? <p> When you find a hair in your food , you really want to have a waitress to blame for it . <p> If all orders are taken by the device , who will the cooks bitch at when they fuck up an order ? <p> If you go into an Applebees with your toddler , you expect him to be served a margarita instead of apple juice . Will a tablet do that ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ca n't even operate a DVR remote control ? How in the hell are they supposed to figure out how to use a tablet to order a cup of extra hot decaf , a water with no ice and a bowl of chicken soup with no salt ? And who will bring them their mug of hot water so they can rinse the silverware before they use it ? <p> Will dirty old men still feel the need to grab the ass of the tablet whenever it bends over to pick up something off the floor ? <p> If there are no waiters , who will be responsible for wiping down these dirty sticky tablets at the end of the day ? <p> How are tablets going to wear skid-resistant shoes from Payless ? <p> Who will drunk older women flirt with if all they have is a battery-operated device that can service all their needs ? Oh , wait . Forget that one . <p> What will happen when the tablets break down ? And you know they will break down . Any restaurant turns into a cluster fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what will customers do in this dire situation ? <p> If there are no waiters , who will managers suppress ? <p> How will a tablet take an undercooked burger back to the kitchen even though the customer asked for it medium rare and then ask the cooks to please burn the fuck out of the patty until it resembles a goddamn hockey puck ? <p> These are things that must be kept in mind before we turn our restaurants over to the world of technology . Servers have an important role in restaurants that maybe some big corporations are forgetting . Customers like the feeling of being taken care of and a electronic tablet will simply not serve that need . We servers are there to treat our guests with respect and to make sure their dining experience is a good one . Our customers deserve the attention that only a human being can give them . A tablet will only offer a cold and impersonal experience to diners . For me personally , if a customer is going to have cold impersonal meal dealing with a machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they order , I want to be that machine that provides them with that experience . Call me old-fashioned , but I care . <p> If you care about this national trend , please share this article with everyone in the whole entire world . <p> It seems like only yesterday that I was writing about a baby that went into an Applebees as a sweet innocent toddler and came out as a drunk alcoholic 15 month old with addiction issues . Apparently , getting babies drunk is all the rage because it happened again this time at an Olive Garden in Florida . A two and a half year old boy was mistakenly served sangria instead of orange juice and he got all drunk and bleary eyed . The mother said that as they were eating , the waiter came over and whisked the cup away and just told them he had to get them another one . When the nosy mother asked why , the waiter explained the mix up . So wait . This waiter was going to just try to sneak it away without telling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as no big deal ? He was seriously going to not tell them why he suddenly had to pull the cup away from the thirsty kid ? He thought it was okay to not tell the mother that he had accidentally served her child sangria ? I really like this waiter , but he could have stuck to his plan and not tell her that they got the baby trashed . He could have just said that he realized the glass was dirty or the orange juice was expired . Of course the worry-wart mom took the baby to the hospital and he is fine . Cmon . Its sangria from The Olive Garden . We all know that shit is mostly fruit punch with a tablespoon of cheap red wine thrown in it . But if The Olive Garden is going to start indiscriminately handing out sangria I may have to rethink my opinion on them . <p> Now I do n't  have a baby , but this got me to thinking . I have a plan . I want to wrap my dog up in a Snuggie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will order my " baby " a cranberry juice and tell them that he is getting over a urinary tract infection . When they bring his cup to the table , I will dump out the cranberry juice and substitute it with some Cosmo that I will have in my flask . I will then proceed to make a scene . " Oh my God ! My baby is drunk ! My baby is drunk . The dingo ate my baby ! My baby is drunk ! Who served a Cosmo to my precious baby ? I will sue , I tell you ! I will sue ! ! " At this point the manager will come out and ask me what the problem is . I will show him my baby and tell him that before he was served a Cosmo he was a perfectly fine baby . But now he is slurring his words , his eyes are bloodshot and he is covered in doggie fur . This is clearly the fault of the restaurant who accidentally served him a Cosmo . I will rush my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get my case set up . I will settle out of court for a lifetime supply of Bloomin Onions- and Aussie Cheese Fries . <p> I do n't  know what 's going out there in the world where servers are getting babies drunk . All I know is I have a shift tonight and if there is a baby within of ten foot radius of my station I am going to force feed it a tequila shot and make it play a round of beer pong with me . Drunk babies are fun ! <p> Have you heard about the worlds luckiest baby who was served a margarita without being carded or even having to ask for it ? This baby has my dream life . At an Applebees in Michigan , a baby was mistakenly served a margarita instead of the apple juice his mother had ordered for him . I guess after a few sips of the sweet nectar known as Tequila , the 15-month-old boy started acting strangely . Although it is not official , I feel certain that the baby started drunk texting and coming on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , his words were slurred and he was drooling . The mother opened up his sippy cup and realized that her baby was on the road to an AA meeting and he did n't  even have his drivers license yet . Of course she complained ( as she should have ) and the manager apologized ( as he should have . ) The mother had this pearl of wisdom to say : " Nobody at the table ordered alcoholic drinks , so he definitely shouldnt have received one . " Brilliant , mom . Like if someone had ordered a margarita it might be a little bit more understandable why they poured a freakin margarita into a sippy cup and then gave it to the person in the high chair ? But since no one ordered anything from the bar , it was extra super wrong for this to happen . <p> They took the baby to the hospital where his blood alcohol level was .10 over the legal limit for an adult driver . Hopefully , they took away the keys to his Big Wheel because parents do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the massive hangover he had the next morning . The baby was quoted as saying , " Why do I always think I can handle that last cocktail ? Never again . I need a Big Mac to soak up some of this alcohol . Mom , can I get a Happy Meal ? " The mother reminded him that the Happy Meal may or may not have a toy in it . The baby replied by puking and crawling into the kitchen to make a Bloody Mary . " A little hair of the dog , then , " said the lushy toddler . <p> No word on what Applebees has done to make sure this does not happen again . I suspect more training will come into play where they will potentially ask to see some identification from anyone who orders a drink , alcoholic or otherwise . I would also suggest that they offer this baby a lifetime supply of Roses Lime juice , triple sec and house tequila since they are the ones who introduced the kid to the joys of cocktails .

Every place has roaches , that is so no big deal . The rodents can be a big turn off to the customers though . Do n't  get me wrong , I am no fan of them either . When a customer feels a mouse run across their feet I can pretty much kiss my tip good bye . Rats are even worse because those bitches ai n't  scared of people .

Plenty of people tell me I " bitch too much " and to them I say , " Well , look at the blog title .

After all , only a happy , motivated and loyal workforce creates success for any business . But then , having read this blog for quite some time , the described situation does n't  surprise me at all . <p> The sad truth is that so many restaurants view the staff as a bunch of serfs .

Although her delivery date was only days away , the the temptation for one last meal out before being tied down to a bundle of joy for the next eighteen years was too much and she decided to take herself out to dinner . She sat in a booth and asked for an iced tea . As the waitress set the tall glass of tea on the table , the woman noticed that there was no lemon wedge . " What kind of waitress does n't  serve a lemon with an iced tea ? " she thought . At that precise moment , she felt a kick in her stomach . It was n't a simple twisting of her baby .

The mother , worried and alone , did n't  know what else to do but let things happen . She leaned back in the booth and two minutes later she was looking at her newborn baby . With curly blond hair , hazel eyes , a devious smile and a black apron covering his privates , the baby looked up at his mother . With his tiny little hands , he pointed at the iced tea . His face scrunched up in a look of confusion and his lips moved into a pout as he began making noises with his new found vocal chords .. <p> " Hello , little baby .

I have had it many times in my life but until last week I had never tried to sell it as a special . Each moment that it became time for me to announce the dessert specials , I rattled them off with ease . <p> " Tonight we have a flourless chocolate cake that is served with warm chocolate sauce and topped with fresh whipped cream and raspberries . We also have a banana bread pudding that is served warm with a scoop of house-made vanilla ice cream and a salted caramel sauce . Finally , I have for you this evening a panna cotta served with a blueberry coulis and fresh strawberries and then garnished with a sprig of mint .

Ill just take the check . " <p> It is n't until mid-way through my shift that someone gives me pause . <p> " What 's panna cotta ? " <p> Now , had I already looked up the clear and concise definition of panna cotta that I offered at the top of this blog post , all would be fine . However , I did not have my phone on me , for it against the rules to have a cell phone on the floor which is why mine was safely stored on the top shelf over the coffee maker and under a napkin so I had easy access to send out random tweets , play Words With Friends and take the occasional photo . <p> ( " Aha ! ! Unprofessional asshole , " shouts Anon . ) <p> I quickly realize that although I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , I do not have a good description of it that I can simply spout out . <p> " Panna cotta is a its a custard , but its different . Ummm , do you know what flan is ? No ? Well , its a little bit like flan but different It has a gelatin in it , I know that , but its not like its Jello or anything . Its really good . Panna cotta is umum " <p> And then come the words that no one should ever use when describing panna cotta or any other dessert for that matter . <p> " Its like a gelatinous pudding . " <p> I see the faces at table 16 recoil in horror at the the thought of a pudding that is of the gelatinous nature . Honestly , would you order a dessert that has the word " gelatinous " attached to it ? Of course not . They probably are picturing a pudding that has sat in the sun for two days and is lumpy and indigestible . Wikipedia defines gelatin as " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from collagen obtained from various animal by-products . It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food , pharmaceuticals , photography , and cosmetic manufacturing .

You suck ! -Anon ) <p> They decide to skip dessert all together and I would not be surprised if they hurried home to throw up their dinner having now imagined a giant bowl of gelatinous pudding . As soon as they are gone , I hurry to my cell phone to look up the definition of panna cotta so I can describe it correctly next time .

They both laughed as I wiped off the side of my face <p> It 's funny , panna cotta is on our regular dessert menu , and even knowing what it is , I 'm always at a loss for how to describe it .

I probably say the shit you said tonight just about every night . That 's why when people want a recommendation , I memorized a description I made for one dish and told every table to buy it , until one day last week some idiot in the marketing department decided to feature it on the table tents .

@@106055404 @1455404/ <h> Monthly Archives : October 2012 <p> In case you have n't heard , New York City was hit yesterday with a bitch of a hurricane named Sandy . The only way you would n't know about this is if you live under a rock or a bridge like a skanky gutter troll , so yeah , maybe Springs1 has n't  heard yet . Anyway , its pretty bad around here . Trees are on the road , there are millions of people without any power and the subways are not running because there is more water in the tunnels than there is in a Jack and Coke at a dive bar . It is a time when you really learn to set your priorities in order like food , water and survival . However , if you are the general manager at 5 Napkin Burger in Hells Kitchen , your only priority is to get that restaurant back open so you can serve some damn hamburgers ! <p> I was contacted by a reader , who shall remain nameless since we do n't  want to get him or her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napkin . It was sent by the general manager last night at 8:00 PM , which is pretty much when Sandy was at the height of her bitchiness . It alerted all hourly employees to expect to open the next day . So while buildings were falling apart and tankers were being washed ashore , this asshole was all about " how can I sell some more bacon cheddar burgers . " This morning at 11 ; 45 , they got another email telling them that since the subways are not running , to take a cab in and they will be reimbursed the money . I was told that this was the same offer given to them during last years Hurricane Irene and they are still awaiting that reimbursement money . <p> Hey , 5 Napkin Burger in Hells Kitchen : have some fucking compassion , assholes . Most of your employees probably do n't  even have fucking electricity so how in the hell are they supposed to iron their uniforms before they show up to work . Do you really want a bunch of wrinkled servers taking orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since there were 90 mph blowing through their apartments but sure , you wan na sell some Lobster Roll Sliders , so by all means force your employees to figure out how to get to work . <p> Its really a double-edged sword for those if us in the restaurant industry because if we do n't  work , we do n't  make money . As much as someone would want to stay home and pump the Hudson River out of their bedroom , maybe they need to go to work so they can make a few dollars to replace all the food in their fridge that is spoiling since the power has been out for 18 hours . Being a waiter is n't like working on salary in an office where if the place shuts down , you 'll still get paid . When restaurants close down , we lose money and we do n't  get a chance to make it up . We cant claim a personal or vacation day because for most restaurant workers , those are as foreign as 401Ks and pensions . <p> Maybe the right thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servers were able to make it to work and how many of them wanted to do so . Its just plain asshole behavior to demand attendance the morning after New York Citys worst storm in the history of ever . I get it : 5 Napkin needs to make money . I also get that some servers would want to be there if they could . But there has to be a balance of business and compassion . If your employee says he s not going to be able to make it into work because of a natural disaster unlike anyone proceeding it , then you just have to buck up and say , " Well , well do without you , but as soon as you can get back to work , well be ready to have you . " If the mayor of New York City is telling people to stay home unless they absolutely must go out , I do n't  think selling french fries is enough of a reason to change his mind . <p> To my friend who has to go to 5 Napkin today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to make it to work or your boss changes his mind .

" I got an email the other day and it was about you . " <p> " Oh , really ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My mouth goes dry , my eyes widen and my knees buckle . The hair on my arms stands up and my pulse quickens.As I try to keep from swallowing my tongue , my brain begins running through every possible scenario that would cause someone to write an email about me and send it to my boss . <p> Oh my God , did that woman two weeks ago see me stick my tongue out at her baby because that baby totally had it coming . It was so rude , that baby , the way it kept laughing at the top of her lungs and shrieking with delight . Or maybe the email is about that time I told the man at booth 7 that I could n't vouch for the Cabernet but the glass of Chardonnay that I was currently enjoying in the sidestand was quite delicious . Could it have been about me playing Words With Friends in the bathroom when that lady knocked on the door and I screamed out " occupado " and then when I came out I told her I was very busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this post I wrote about my regular who never shuts up ? Maybe its from the two-top who saw the raccoon on the patio last week . I stood there and watched it with them but told them not to tell my manager because if he knew about it he would call the exterminator and have him come and trap it and take it away like he did earlier this summer to that little baby raccoon who ended up being dropped off on Long Island somewhere.Sure the raccoon we saw last week could have been rabid or mad with grief and still trying to find its offspring that we shipped away , but she was so cute sitting there on the fire escape that I did n't  want to rat it out and see it get trapped . Did someone see me on television and did n't  appreciate my attitude so they felt compelled to alert my boss that he has an asshole on his staff ? Or maybe the email is from a customer who saw me box up some food to-go after that piece of steak may or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the box with care <p> . Oh , the horror ! This email could be about so many things ! I see my job slipping from my fingers and I imagine myself traipsing up and down Ninth Avenue dropping off applications at restaurants that only want to hire young waiters who are just filling time between their modeling gigs . <p> " Yeah , I 've never gotten an email about you before , but I guess there 's a first time for everything , " says my manager . <p> " Heh , heh . Yeah , sure " I mumble . " So , whatd say ? " <p> Long pause . It feels like the lights are getting dimmer but they may be because the blood is flowing from brain and right down to my feet . <p> My manager smiles . " They wanted to compliment you and your service . They said you were so friendly to them and that your shirt and apron were nicely pressed . They just wanted me to know how great you were . Good job . " <p> A sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear that had crept into my body within the last fifteen seconds . <p> " Oh , that 's cool , " I say . " But duh , what else would someone have to say about me ? " <p> Yeah , that was truly fucking scary . 109839 @qwx969839 <p> And now a word from Arlene Sinclair , the cafeteria lady at Stroman High School in Victoria , Texas who asked me if she could use my blog as a place to express her concerns about a very serious issue : <p> Hey , yall , first off I have got to thank The Bitchy Waiter for letting me say some words on the internets , but I have shocking news . My favorite restaurant in the whole world played a new commercial last night and it just about turned my world upside down , yall . Lemme just say it : I love Olive Garden . I caint help it , but I do . Those bread sticks just do a number on me and I caint stop eatin em . I hear they have a never-ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't  never had that cause its got lettuce in it . Anyways , I was watching the telly last night . ( I love Honey Boo Boo ! ! ) and I sees a commercial on for Olive Garden and it was totally different . You know how they usually show a bunch of people sittin around a table laughing and eating food and and then at the end they say , " When you 're here , you 're family ? " Well what I saw last night they showed a woman doing some of that yogi bear exercise and a bunch of kids taking pictures on the cellular phones . How in tarnation does that have anything to do with Olive Garden ? And then at the end they just said " Go Olive Garden . " Do n't  mess with my Olive Garden . <p> I did a little bit of Internets research and found this articletelling me that OG is changing the way they are advertising because their business is down . Now that do n't  make alick of sense to me since every time I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday when theys selling 102 ? flat screen t.v.s for $1.99 . I also read that they are starting to have some food that has fewer calories for people who are watching their weight . Now do n't  get me wrong , I watch my weight too , you know . I watch it get higher and higher , LOl ! I do n't  go to OG to watch my calories . If I want to eat healthy and lose weight , I do what all Americans do : I go to Subway . Please DO NOT change , Olive Garden , I beg of you on all things holy and deep fried . <p> One thing that does look kinda interesting is this new " Dinner Today , Dinner Tomorrow " offer , which gives customers who come in for dinner a second meal to take home . They 're cold and then I can just heat em up the next day . I might like this idea a lot because I can buy a fancy Olive Garden dinner for my kids and husband but I wo n't have to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my purse . <p> I suppose I understand that all things have to change , I just do n't  like it . I still recall how upset I was when they changed the recipe for Coke so long ago and came out with that new Coke . Lordy , I was so pissed off about that and I skipped breakfast for a week . I finally switched over to Dr. Pepper and life went on but I just do n't  know if I can handle all these changes at the OG . On Friday afternoons after me and all the other girls from the cafeteria are done with work , I loves to go to the OG and get myself a glass of white zin and eat some bread sticks . Thats sorta like my own little tradition , you know ? I just want things to stay the same and if Olive Garden is changing , what next ? Is Arbys gon na start selling salads or is McDonalds gon na start selling pizza ? Where will it end ? If I want pizza , I do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Okay , I guess I better go . I am at work and the first batch of kids is about to be served lunch . I need to go open up five gallons of mac and cheese and pull those fish sticks out of the oven . I just wanted to vent about Olive Garden . " When you 're here , you 're family " is no longer , but to me , those waitresses at the OG will always be my family . I love em so much which is why I always tell them how great they are to me and my friends . I make sure to tell every single one what a good job they 're doing because I think that 's what they really want from me . We can all make money , but how often do you get a compliment ? <p> My favorite type of post to write is a Comment on Comments one . They make me feel all warm and toasty on the inside . On a post calledCredit Card Fraud is Not Cool , a lovely woman named Susan Swenton had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profane waiter or vocabulary-impaired waiter or lazy waiter because you rely way too much on shock value words which then become mundane and predictable and , durst I say it , annoying . <p> Dear Susan , <p> Fuck off . Yeah , I durst say it . ( And that 's the correct use of that word in a sentence . ) <p> Love , The Bitchy Waiter 109839 @qwx969839 <p> You know me , always on the lookout to help those who are less fortunate then myself and I found someone who is in desperate need of my assistance . It is whoever wrote the stupid fucking article called7 Tips to Reduce Your Restaurant Bill . Most of the suggestions fall in the same category as " the earth is round , " " the sky is blue " and " that old lady is gon na send her tea back because the water is n't hot enough . " In other words , duh . I made a few amendments to the article that I think most servers can truly appreciate . <p> 1 . Use coupons and promotions.Sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you can find discounts for 50% to 90% off <p> because servers love waiting on people who have coupons . Groupon Groupies are always so pleasant and generous . I mean , if a person is using Groupon to save money then that totally must mean they are going to use those extra dollars they saved to tip better , right ? <p> Also take advantage of restaurant promotions . For instance , Applebees consistently offers a two-for-$20 deal , which includes two meals ( you select from a list of entrees ) and an appetizer . Olive Garden is popular for its limited-time offers , such as unlimited soup , salad and breadsticks . Why are you even at Applebees or Olive Garden ? If you are eating at one of those places , you have much bigger issues to deal with then how to save a few bucks . <p> 2 . Buy cheap gift certificates.Visit Restaurant.com , where you can browse local restaurants and buy discounted gift certificates such as $25 certificates for $10 , or $50 certificates for $20 . <p> Just remember to tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you are using a coupon does n't  mean that your server should make less money . If every person who sat in his station that night had a 50% off coupon , and they all tipped on the discounted amount , the server would be making half of what he normally would . Does that sound fair to you ? <p> 3 . Skip the booze.If you order wine by the glass , you could be looking at a 400% markup . And as delicious as they are , fancy , fruity drinks are also overpriced . Even at a budget-friendly chain restaurant , you could end up paying as much as $7 for a strawberry daiquiri . <p> I want to know where a strawberry daiquiri only costs $7 . Unless its at Applebees or Olive Garden you can expect to see me there as soon as I am finished typing this . The cheapest ( and healthiest ) route , of course , is to order water.Just make sure you ask for lots of lemons and some Splenda so that you can make your own lemonade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  want lemonade , ask for cucumber slices or some fresh mint to brighten up your water . Just because you do n't  want to spend $3 on a Coke does n't  mean your taste buds have to suffer . Trust me , waiters do n't  mind one bit . And once they bring your bowl of lemons , that is a good time to ask for more bread . <p> 4 . Order an entree that includes extras.If you 're going to spend more than $10 on a dinner entree , it should include a soup , salad or dessert . If you cant eat everything , take the rest of your meal home or purposely save some leftovers.Again , where the fuck is this chick eating where she thinks a $10 dinner entree should automatically come with something ? In New York City , the only thing that is going to come with a $10 entree is a half empty plate . And if you take the leftovers with you , please make sure its not two or three fucking french fries . At least make it worth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one more bite of steak worth the million years it will take that Styrofoam container to decompose ? Oh it is ? Then by all means , do it . And have your green beans in a separate container as well , you cheap un-caring fuck . <p> 5 . Order an appetizer as your meal.Appetizers like quesadillas or chicken wings can easily be a sufficient meal , especially because they are usually served in portions big enough to share . <p> If you can save three dollars , forgo that need for vegetable servings . Who needs em ? You just eat that big plate of chicken wings or quesadillas and get yourself some more free bread and in no time at all you will have saved enough money to go get that liposuction you have been dreaming about . <p> 6 . Check your bill.If you think you paid too much for a mediocre meal , do n't  be afraid to politely mention it to your server . We 've all ordered a chicken dish that included more pasta than chicken . Rather than being annoyed about paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe you 'll score a discount or gift card or even a free meal.No place is going to serve equal parts pasta to equal parts chicken . We do n't  even do that at home , do we ? So she suggests that after you eat it , you just mention that you did n't  like it so maybe you can get it comped ? Hell , no . If you do that , your server is going to think you 're a total asshole . Nothing is more annoying than a person licking their plate clean and then letting us know that they did n't  like their food . If it happens in my station , the only thing they 're going to get is an extra side of " too fucking bad . " <p> 7 . Earn cash back through surveys.I do n't  even know what the fuck she is talking about . I f you cant afford to eat out , just eat at home . <p> I think you will agree with me that my suggestions make this article much much better . If you do agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commentabout it . Tell them The Bitchy Waiter sent you . That way they can see that the author really needed to do a little more research before posting the story . And that research could have started with a quick Google search for me , The Bitchy Waiter . If you think that those tips that were offered were a big steaming pile of " no shit , " I hope you will share this blog post . 109839 @qwx969839 
@@106055405 @1455405/ <h> Monthly Archives : October 2011 <p> Little Orphan Annie thought everything was going to be fine once she ended up in Daddy Warbucks mansion . What she did n't  know was that Daddy Warbucks often had a whim where he devoted all of his attention to a new project only to quickly lose interest shortly thereafter . His plan to adopt an orphan was purely for publicity and to focus attention away from his shady financial dealings and his close relationship with the president of the United States , Franklin Delano Roosevelt . When Annie first learned that she was to move in with the millionaire and live in his house staffed with butlers , cooks , maids and his lovely personal secretary , Miss Grace Farrell , she thought her troubles were over . They were just beginning . <p> Oh sure , the first few weeks were a dream . She has tennis lessons with Don Budge and an indoor swimming pool . Her dog Sandy was fed roast beef and the two of them slept in a feather bed with velvet pillows . Daddy Warbucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would dance and laugh but after about four months , the attention started to wane . The staff that at first seemed so excited to meet Annie soon grew tired of her incessant cheerfulness and began to resent all the extra work that came with having a child and a dog added to the household . Of course Mr. Warbucks did n't  increase their salary even though the workload had certainly increased . At the beginning , the cook , Mrs. Pugh , made Annies favorite things for dinner but when she noticed that her boss did n't  seem to care what Annie ate anymore , Annies meals turned into sandwiches and leftovers . Drake the butler no longer delivered her food to her room and instead Annie had to eat in the kitchen if she could persuade someone to open a can of soup for her . Even Miss Farrells attention faded . She hated kids even more than Miss Hannigan did and the only reason she was ever nice to Annie was because she was in love with Mr. Warbucks and she wanted to please him . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maids , Cecil , who picked out all of Annies clothes , she let her hatred for Annie shine through . Many times , Miss Farrell would stick Annie with a safety pin making her cry out in pain and disturb Mr. Warbucks when he tried to read the paper . <p> One year after Annie had arrived at the mansion , Mr. Warbucks needed some new good press so he went back to the orphanage and picked out a new orphan . This time he picked out that little cry baby bitch , Molly . Of course it made all the papers and people suddenly forgot what a dirty millionaire businessman Mr. Warbucks was and all they saw was a wonderful man who loved orphans . " What a crock of shit , " said Annie as she sat in the corner and watched the staff give Molly the same old song and dance she had gotten only twelve months before . It was then that Annie decided to run away . <p> But where could she go ? She could n't go back to the orphanage . She hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her old bed that had more bed bugs than bed springs . The orphanage was run now by Lily St. Regis who had copped a plea deal and sent Miss Hannigan and Rooster to prison . Annie could never forgive Lily for pretending to be her real mother and knew if she ever saw her again , she would cut that bitchs face . Annie heard on the street that her old nemesis , Pepper , had started a tent city under a bridge on the Lower East Side . She took Sandy and headed downtown to face Pepper and ask her is she could stay with her until she got her feet on the ground . Of course Pepper was happy to see that Annie had come crawling back . " I knew you 'd never make it any place other than the street , " Pepper said . " You 're trash . Always have been and always will be . " Annie held back the tears , but inside she knew Pepper was right . Her parents were dead and gone and she was foolish to have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish to think they collected things like ashtrays and art . The only thing Annies parents collected was dust as they lay rotting in Potters Field . <p> " Please , Pepper . I 'm sorry I was so mean to you . Can I just stay here for a few weeks until I find a job ? Bet your bottom dollar you wo n't even know I 'm here , I promise , " begged Annie . <p> Pepper crossed her arms and smiled . She had Annie right where she wanted her . " Yeah , you can stay here , but if you are n't  bringing money into Peppertown within one week , your ass is outta here . And once you do get a job , I get 50% of whatever you make . " She reached out to shake Annies hand and as soon as Annie lifted her hand to return the shake , Pepper pulled away from her . " Dumb ugly ginger bitch . Go sleep on that pile of newspapers and shut the hell up . And if that stupid mutt of yours makes one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make a coat out of him . " <p> Annie sat on the newspapers and wiped the tears from her eyes . " The sunll come out tomorrow , " she said to Sandy . " I just know it . " <p> The next day Annie hit the pavement looking for a job . She was only 13 years old , but she had developed early and could easily pass for a 16 year old . She saw a restaurant called Bottom Dollar Diner and went inside . The special of the day was sunny side up eggs and hash . It seemed like the perfect place to work . " I 'm looking for a job , " said Annie to the fat balding man with the greasy face who was sitting at the cash register and reading a newspaper that had a picture of Molly and Daddy Warbucks on the front page . <p> " Ai n't  got no jobs , " answered the cashier/owner without even looking up . <p> " But I can clean anything you need . I can cook or wash dishes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen : the sunll come out tomorrow , bet your bottom dollar that- " <p> " We do n't  need no singers here or any dishwashers either . Go away . " <p> " But I 'll do anything , " Annie pleaded . " Anything at all ! " <p> " Anything ? " The man looked up from the newspaper revealing crooked yellow teeth and a cold sore . " Whatdaya mean , anything ? " He put down the newspaper and walked towards Annie . <p> " Anything at all , mister ! Smile darn ya smile ! Anything at all ! " <p> The man led Annie to his office where he told her he would find a job for her to do . Ten minutes later , Annie was the new waitress and the man was buckling his pants and smoking a cigarette . It was n't the ideal way to get a job , but Annie was proud that she had found a way to earn her keep at Peppertown . Her knees were dirty and her jaw was sore , but she had a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventua lly was able to afford her own room in a boarding house . By the time she was 17 years old , she practically ran the Bottom Dollar Diner . She dreamed of the day that Fat Sam , the owner , would sell her the restaurant and move away . She had faith that sooner or later it would happen and she saved every penny she earned so that when the time came , she would be ready . In the meantime , she waited tables seven days a week . One time she saw Molly on the sidewalk outside the restaurant selling apples . " Its a hard knock life , Molly , " she thought . She went outside and bought three apples from the little street urchin . Molly did n't  recognize her which was fine with Annie . She took the apples inside and began to make them into a pie that would be the special the next day . " The sunll come out tomorrow , bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow , therell be sun , " she sang softly as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandy . <p> " Good boy , Sandy , that 's a good boy ! " said Annie . She petted her loyal companion on the head . " Some day , well own the Bottom Dollar Diner and you and I will live happily ever after , I just know it . The sun will come out tomorrow , I just know it ! " <p> This post was brought to you by my Halloween costume . Happy Halloween ! 109839 @qwx969839 <p> Any server who is worth his salt is also a good photographer . We have to be because so often , we are called upon to be the one who snaps the photo of the special event that is happening in our section . Great Grandma Bettys 110th birthday ? " Waiter , can you take our picture ? " Girls night out and seeing Mama Mia ! for the tenth time ? " Waiter , can you take our picture ? " Finally passed that kidney stone after drinking three five dollar pints at happy hour ? " Waiter , can you take our picture ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the olden days before we had fancy computer machines and horseless carriages , we used to take pictures with something called " film . " After the 12 , 24 or 36 shots were taken , that roll of film was then carried down to the H.E.B. , Krogers or Walgreens where that film was " developed . " It took about four days unless you wanted to pay extra for next day service or if you were rich you could go to the one-hour photo place at the mall . It was n't until you picked up your envelope of pictures that you discovered what your photos looked like . Its not like today where you snap a shot and then everyone looks at it right away to give photo approval and then seconds later that photo is on Facebook , Flickr and Manhunt . No , in days of yore we had to wait days on end to see our prized photography and on occasion the store would lose your roll of film . <p> One time when I was in the fourth grade , my class took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replica of one of Christopher Columbus boats . I do n't  recall if it was the Nina , the Pinot Grigio or The Santa Margherita , but it was huge deal in my nine year old life . I used my allowance to buy a roll of 36 exposure film and used the whole roll for one day which was a real extravagance . The next day , my mom took me to Albertsons to drop off the film and four days later , I went to see what my pictures looked like . All the envelopes of developed pictures were alphabetized in a big drawer and customers would go through them to find their envelope and then carry it to the register to pay for it . Mine was n't there . My little slip of paper confirmed it should be back that day , but it was n't . I went to the counter where I was told , " Sometimes it comes a day later . Check back tomorrow . " The next day , I begged my mom to drive me back to check again . I simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were awaiting me . Again , it was not there . I went through the whole drawer and it was nowhere to be found . This went on for a week until finally I was told something that crushed my nine year old heart . " Sometimes it gets lost . Well just refund you another roll of film . " <p> What ? How does this happen ? I just get another roll of film ? But what about the pictures I took of all my friends on the school bus ? How will I ever see the Nina , the Pinot Grigio and/or The Santa Margherita again ? They did n't  understand that I had taken pictures of a once-in-a lifetime trip and it could never be replaced by an empty roll of film . I was heartbroken , I really was . Tears happened and anguish and wailing cries of " Why me ? " My mom consoled me with the " sometimes life is n't fair " speech and it was the first time I ever understood that sometimes things just do n't  turn out right through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience and a gentle nudge into the real world . It seems so trivial now , but then it was a really big life lesson for me . It took me weeks to get over that I would never get to see that picture of Felicia in the galley of the boat or of Machon next to the man dressed like a Christopher Columbus . It really affected me . For weeks and weeks every time we would go to Albertsons I would steal away to the film counter and thumb through all the envelopes just in case my pictures had been found . They never were . Life was not fair . Felicia showed me her pictures and let me have a couple of them but it was n't the same . I was thankful for the two pictures I had , but I still wanted to see the 36 that I had taken all on my own . <p> This is what I was thinking about last night when table 16 handed me their cameras and asked me to document the birthday of Mom who was visiting from Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they could all see if they approved . They all liked it . " You 're really good , " they said . " You should be a professional photographer ! " <p> " Well , I take a lot of pictures . I guess after a while you get really good at it , " I joked . I took another picture with someone elses camera . On the screen , I saw a happy mom with her husband , son and daughter-in law . " Say cheese , " I said . The photo turned out great . They were all happy and it was perfectly composed and focused . I handed them the camera for approval and again they liked what they saw . So yeah , I took some good pictures last night but I 'd give anything in the world to see what the pictures I took in 1977 in Port Lavaca looked like . 109838 @qwx969838 <p> We 've all had those days where things get to be too much and we find ourselves at the end of our proverbial rope . Granted , our job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who think that their ham and cheese panini is the be-all end-all most important sandwich on the face of the planet and if they do n't  get it right this minute they are going to go bat-ass crazy . Or maybe you have a boss who wants to cut your shifts in half and does n't  care that you have bills to pay and cocktails to order and now youll have to start putting that shit on your Visa card . There are any number of ways to deal with these stressful moments . Personally , I find that going into the walk-in for a couple of minutes where it is nice , cool and quiet does wonders for my peace of mind , especially when I go in there with a coffee cup of champagne that I can down in three seconds . Or sometimes going into the bathroom and splashing cool water on my face helps me feel better , especially when I go in there with a coffee cup of champagne that I can down in three seconds . The point is , there are lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not recommend is throwing a meat cleaver at someone . But hey , if that 's what it takes to calm you down , who am I to say anything ? I say potato , you say meat cleaver . <p> This month , a waitress named Maria Benavidez in San Antonio , Texas was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after she done lost her temper and threw a meat cleaver at her boss hitting him in the head so hard that he needed six stitches to sew that shit up . Her bail was set at $30,000 . Damn . If she makes $75 a shift , she has to pick up 400 extra ones just to pay for that . According to the news report , she was upset that her boss was cutting her hours . She was also upset because she opened an envelope containing a paycheck belonging to the victims stepson , who also works there . I 'm not quite sure what that means . Why was she opening that ? Maybe to see how much he was getting paid ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was like , " Oh I am so mad I am going to throw a meat cleaver at somebody ! " I du n no . The story says she was asked to leave by the boss and when she did n't  the police were called and that 's when kitchen utensils started flying . <p> I can understand Marias feelings . Sometimes we need to take out our frustrations somehow and she obviously did n't  have access to some champagne . Once again , we see the dangers of not having a steady supply of bubbly on hand for emergencies just like this . It could have been so different : <p> Boss : Uh , Maria , are you opening my step-kids paycheck ? Maria : Oh , I 'm sorry . I thought it was mine . Oops ! How silly of me . I do n't  know what I was thinking.Boss : Well , stop it . And by the way , I am going to take away one of your shifts . Starting tomorrow , you only work twelve shifts a week and not thirteen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry.Maria : What the hell ? Are you kidding me ? My Monday lunch shift pays for my weekly supply of Roses Lime juice , asshole . How am I supposed to make that money up ? Boss : Well , maybe you can get a part-time job down the street at The Alamo . I hear they need tour guides and they pay you in cash and corn tortillas.Maria : Oh no you dint . What , you just think because my last name is of Hispanic origin that I want to be paid in corn tortillas ? Boss : No , I was just kidding . Chill out . Havent you ever seen the Pee Wee Herman movie where he goes on the tour of the Alamo ? Pedro and Inez ? Cmon , Maria . It was a joke . And plus The Bitchy Waiter was desperate to fit that scene into this blog post simply because this is happening in San Antonio.Maria : That is not funny . I am so freakin pissed off right now that I could throw a goddamn meat cleaver at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you some champagne in a coffee cup and we call it a day ? Maria : Really ? Okay , that sounds swell . Thanks ! <p> You see ? Champagne always saves the day . Hopefully things will work out for Maria . Davy Crockett would not approve of using meat cleavers to solve our work problems . Sam Houston would want you to drink champagne and work things out . Santa Anna would totally want you to throw a meat cleaver at your bosss head . I guess we all have to do what is right for us . And a personal thanks to my seventh grade Texas History teacher , Mr. Moses for teaching me who the hell the main players were in the fight for Texas Independence . Now if you 'll excuse me , I have a coffee cup of champagne that has my name on it . Remember the Alamo , bitches . <p> ( By the way , go here and tell them that they need to have the Bitchy Waiter on their television show . Thanks. ) 109838 @qwx969838 <p> It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for waiter stories and you know my attention-whore ass wants to get a piece of that spotlight so I need your help . They have a Facebook pagewhere you can submit suggestions so you can always go hereand say , " Oooh , girl , youd better call The Bitchy Waiter cause he has the best stories ever . And his hair is all curly and shit and would look great on the television . " My plan of gripe for this proposed television appearance is to discuss the people who do n't  know what the hell a menu is for . You know how freakin annoying it is when someone sits in your station and does n't  bother to open the menu and says , " Can I get some cheese sticks right away ? I 'm starving . " We do n't  have cheese sticks , Bertha Mae Mae . <p> They also have anemail addresswhere you can drop them a line about someone you think would be good for the show . So you could always click this linkand say something like , " My stars , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do declare he would be just perfect for your segment on waiters and their pet peeves .

It was a family of four ; mom , dad and two horribly misbehaving children who are holy terrors of evil . Seriously , they were my first table . What a way to start my foray back into the land of serving . When they come into the restaurant , its like a hurricane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came popping out of a volcano followed by a mudslide placenta . Its a disaster . As they scan the restaurant for a table , any customers sitting next to empty ones cower in fear that they will be the ones forced to finish their meal next to the band of brats . The family chose a booth . In my station . And so it began . <p> As soon as they sat down , mom and dad grabbed all the electric candles from surrounding tables so the kids had something to play with . I 've discussed it before , but I think its really poor parental judgement to let children play with electric candles . Their immature and mushy brains may not recognize the difference the next time they go to a restaurant that has real candles with flames . It is a recipe for disaster if you ask me , but nobody asked me and I am certainly not one to give unsolicited advice . But I 'm right , right ? How is a three year old supposed to know that some candles are for playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids were throwing the candles around , banging their cups on the table , screaming like howler monkeys in heat trying to cough up hairballs , dropping crap on the floor , and in general being a public nuisance and a big fat pain in my little ass . And then I caught a look of the fathers eyes . They were glazed over with saddness . His second cup of coffee had done nothing to make him more alert and the situation seemed to be a desperate one for him . For me , this was going to last thirty minutes tops , but Dad was looking at the next 18 years of his life and it was depressing the hell out of him . I took a class in mind reading at the Learning Annex a few years ago . Madame Buluga taught me a few things so I delved into his thoughts and this is what I read : <p> Damn , this night sucks . I wonder if anyone would notice if I said I was going to the bathroom and instead just got on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never came back . I have about $1200 worth of credit on my Master Card and I could get as far away as possible . Maybe change my name and get a haircut and grow a beard so no one will recognize me . I could get a nice simple job as a stocker on the overnight shift at a Wal-Mart in Topeka and live happily ever after . These kids are crazy . Why do n't  they behave ? Oh , wait I know why ; because all I do is ignore them and they have no concept of how to behave in public , that 's why . And look at my wife . She looks just as pissed off as I am . Maybe shed like to come with me to Topeka ? Naah , then whod take care of the kids ? I 'll leave her too , whatever . God dammit , why did n't  I wear a condom three years ago ? I had them . I was just too caught up in the moment to get it from the night stand . She was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Its okay girl , I love you . Let 's make a baby together . " Famous last words , that 's for sure . And then again two years later . She was telling me to put a goddamn rubber on and I was all , Its okay , baby . I love you so much . Let 's give Jr . a little brother or sister . Lemme just do that for you . I wan na make another baby , baby . " God , what a load of shit . If I do n't  get on the 7 train tonight and escape this hell , I will go get a fucking vasectomy right after we leave this restaurant . I will pay the check and go over to Snips R Us and get that shit taken care of . No more kids . And even then , I will never not wear a condom again . Ever . These kids are awful . " Hate " is a really strong word but " despise " might work . I despise my kids . Hey look at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Look at how friendly he is to his tables and so professional . His hair is amazing too . I wish I was him , not a care in the world I bet . His life is perfect . Mine sucks . You know who is hot ? That chick from The View , what 's her name ? The red head ? Joy Behar , I think . Shes hot . Man , I 'd love to show up at her place with some Fig Newtons and- <p> I lost the train of thought when he was hit on the side of his head by a coloring book that his daughter threw at him but it was just as well because I really did n't  want to see where he was going with that Joy Behar thought . I gave them the check and they rounded up the kids and headed home . Hopefully he followed through on his plan to get his old boys dried out . It would be a service to himself , his wife , the restaurant industry and the world if he could assure us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . They come to the restaurant once a week and I 'm almost willing to chip in for it . I really do n't  like them . They give me a headache , which is what the wife should say the next time he wants to make a baby with her . 109839 @qwx969839 <p> Recently at the restaurant I had a lovely young mother come in with her adorable son . It was just the two of them on a " date night " and they were both very sweet . She specifically asked to sit out of the way of everyone which I assumed was because she had a rather large stroller as new moms are apt to have . I gave her a two-top at the front of the restaurant and handed her a menu . " I 'll give you a chance to settle in and be back in a minute to get you whatever you 'd like , " I said . At this point the baby was just waking up in his stroller and she said , " Better give me a few minutes . Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No problem , " I told her . <p> About five minutes later she called me over . She was now holding the baby in her arms and ready to place the order . The little boy was less than a year old . He had sleepy little eyes and full head of bushy brown hair and cute little hands that were grasping at whatever they could find . " Ill have the mac and cheese and then the salmon , " Mom ordered . " And water is fine . " She did n't  seem to notice that the the little boys hands were creeping into her blouse but it was obvious to me . This kid was feeling up his own motherright in front of me . That baby totally got to second base while I was taking an order . I smiled and went on my way . <p> When the mac and cheese was ready , I placed it on a tray and headed over to table 5 . I was not prepared for what I saw . The baby was having his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was hanging out of young mothers shirt . There was a feeding frenzy going on over there . It was a milk buffet . Cafe con leche con boobie . It was like a National Geographic special happening . I do n't  have a lot of experience with the bosoms other than some close encounters of the drunk kind after too many California Coolers in the 80s . ( Hi , Laurie , say hi to your husband for me . How are the kids ? ) Even though my knowledge of the breasticles is limited , I am pretty sure that letting one hang out in the middle of a restaurant so you can feed your kid as I am innocently trying to place a bowl of macaroni and cheese is inappropriate . We do n't  have a nursing station just like we do n't  have a changing table . Where else was she supposed to do it ? I do n't  know , but I really did n't  feel it was right . <p> " Here is your mac and cheese . Is there anything else you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like a sheet , partition or a separate room ? " I thought . " Or maybe a box of blindfolds for all of us who are not accustomed to seeing breasts while at our jobs ? " I averted my eyes and backed away from the table . " There 's nothing to see over here , folks , nothing at all . Do not look at table five , I repeat , DO NOT look at table five , " I heard the voice in my head screaming . <p> By the time the salmon was ready , the little boy was just as full as mom was from her appetizer . The rest of the service continued sans boobs . She left me a great tip and was completely friendly . I know that breast-feeding is totally natural and I am in no way against it . I can appreciate it as long as I have consumed a four pack of California Coolers and Laurie is just as trashed as I am and laying on my bed circa 1985 . But I question the appropriateness of the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may be old-school , but if she did n't  bring enough for everybody , then maybe she shouldnt have brought it at all . <p> Here is my question to you : was it right or wrong for her to nurse at a table in a restaurant ? Yes , she was at a table away from everyone else but there was a table directly next to her that could have been sat . No , we do not have a place for nursing moms to have some privacy . Yes , boobies make me nervous whether they have a baby hanging off of it or not . No , I was not about to ask her to stop because I am not stupid . But I want to know what you think about the situation . Please share your thoughts . And before you jump all over me , please remember I am not against it . I was just surprised , that 's all . And great . Now I totally want cereal .

And on that note , a blog about butter . <p> xo , The Bitchy Waiter <p> When we start a new job , we always find ourselves full of uncertainty and nerves . We worry about whether or not people will like us and will our co-workers be nice or not . It can be quite stressful and we depend on others to make us feel welcome in a new environment . When someone new comes into my restaurant , I always make sure I am part of the Welcome Wagon . I always introduce myself and offer to take them on a tour of the front and back of the house . I give them tips and pointers on how to make the computer system work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you out if you get in the weeds . Oh , who am I kidding ? I do n't  give a shit about new people . I wait at least a week before I invest any time with them because too many times people quit after two or three days and I realize I wasted two or three whole sentences on them . Some people like to play tricks on the newbies and one of the best happened when I worked at The Black Eyed Pea on West Grey in Houston , Texas . <p> At The Pea , we were responsible for making our own desserts so we had completes access to all of them at any time . One of our favorite snacks was to take two chocolate chip cookies and then make an ice cream sandwich using French Vanilla ice cream . Were we supposed to do that ? Absolutely not . Did we do that ? Every fucking day . So one day we decided to play a trick on some new guy . Tim made himself one of the ice cream sandwiches and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how delicious it was . Of course New Guy wanted to know what it was and if he could have one . " Sure , " said Tim . " Since you 're new let me make it for you . Ill be right back . " Tim went to the cookie bin and pulled out two freshly re-heated not homemade cookies and then walked over to the ice cream freezer . And then walked past the ice cream freezer and went to the tub of whipped butter that we used for the biscuits and cornbread . He took a huge scoop of the butter and placed in between the cookies and smashed it together . Comparing the butter to the French Vanilla , the two desserts looked exactly the same . Off he bounds to New Guy to hand him his freshly made sweet . <p> " Thanks , you 're nice , " said New Guy . <p> " Its what I do , " said Tim . <p> We watched with eager anticipation as New Guy moved the cookie and butter concoction towards his hungry hungry hippo hole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bitch up with butter . It was going to be a big bite . As he bit into it , the cookie crumbled and the butter oozed out of the sides of his mouth .

Of course all us bitches laughed at him as he tried to decide whether or not to swallow that first bite or spit it out . He spit it out , laughed at himself and learned that he had been had . He thought he was now part of the Black Eyed Pea gang . He was n't and would n't be until it was his turn to play the trick on the next New Guy . Until that time , he was the newbie and had to face the fact that another prank could be waiting for him at any time . It sucks being the new guy .

@@106055408 @1455408/ <h> What I Did For Ricki Lake <p> I have been called a fame whore . If that is what I am because I crave attention , fame , the spotlight , and more attention , then so be it . Have I always been this way ? Yes . Yes , I have . Most actors are like that whether they will admit to it or not . Over the years , there have been many ways that I have tried to get my mug on the television , from submitting to reality shows ( I was a semi-finalist for the very first Survivor , but they chose Richard Hatch instead ) to writing to the ladies at The View and asking if the next time they do a dentistry makeover show , can I please come on and get some new choppers . But the first time I tried one of these methods was way back in the early 90s when I tried to get on The Ricki Lake Show with my friend Corinne . <p> At Houlihans Corinne and I used to watch television and share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a roll from the deli downstairs . The same deli where I met Carol Channing . We saw that the talk show was looking for guests for a " My Co-worker Needs a Makeover " episode . Corinna and I hatched up a plan . We would submit her for a makeover because she wanted new clothes and I wanted to be on television . I called the show and left our story on their answering machine : <p> Ricki , my friend Corinne needs a makeover so bad . She always wears the same thing and she never wears make up or brushes her hair . Shes a pretty girl , but she needs help . Ricki , whenever we go out after work , she wears her uniform and its all covered with food and stains but she does n't  care . Ricki , my friend needs a makeover . Help ! <p> We hung up and thought " whatever . " A few days later a producer called us . This was in the days before cell phones so I du n no how they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back then or maybe a pager . It was so long ago they might have sent the message via Pony Express . But they wanted to meet us ! That day . Could they come to the restaurant right then and interview us ? Oh shit ! I ran over to Corinne and told her that the Ricki Lake people were on the way and we needed her to look like she needed a makeover stat . Truth be told , Corinne is a very pretty girl . In no way did she need a makeover and she would never have gone out after work wearing her uniform , but this was The Ricki Lake Show . If the truth had to be bent a little , then we would bend it . We forgo seeing to our customers as we set out to get prepared for our interview . Corinne wiped off her makeup and wrinkled her uniform . She put her hair up in some ratty ass pile on top of her head and I think we put some honey mustard and other condiments on her clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some chick who was about 25 years old and she had a big old Polaroid camera hanging around her neck . She interviewed us for about ten minutes as we continued to ignore the customers who were dying of thirst and starvation in our stations . This was television . Priorities , people . They snapped a picture of Corinne and said they would be getting back to us . <p> They never did . It must have been crystal clear that Corinne just wanted a new outfit from Chicos or TJ Max and I just wanted to be on television . She probably saw right away that Corinne did n't  need a makeover and they moved on to the next batch of potential guests . We were crushed . As the week ended and we realized that our dream of meeting Ricki Lake was not going to happen , our lives slowly went back to normal . We kept watching The Ricki Lake Show each morning and sharing our egg and cheese on a roll , but it never quite tasted the same as it did before Ricki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . Its okay .

What 's wrong with looking like Rikki Lake ? <p> I used to watch Rikki all the time .. and on a visit to NYC about 12 years ago got tickets to watch her show .

Now I get it that everyone would like a tip . Who does n't  , but why is there a fucking tip jar at the grocery store ? I know these women are n't  making $20 an hour or anything , but I am sure they are making more than the $4.65 that I make . These dog-gone blasted tip jars all over the place are desensitizing the world to people who actually rely on tips to survive . Is Susan at the Starbucks claiming those tips that she makes and then paying taxes on them ? Hell , no . Or is the dry cleaner ? Why in the pudding pops do I need to feel obligated to tip the dry cleaner ? Isnt it enough that I do n't  tip him at Christmas time but now I have to not tip him every week ? Before anyone jumps all down my throat about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and the tips help her , let me say this . Nobody is making enough money , grocery store lady . She at least gets a paycheck , which I do not . My most recent paycheck was for sixty-eight cents . I had to walk my lazy ass all the way to the bank to deposit 68- . It hardly seemed worth it and I almost tossed the check in the trash , but if it was two quarters , a dime , a nickle and three pennies I would n't throw that away so I deposited the check . But after customers tip the grocery store lady and the Starbucks bitch and the dry cleaner by the time they get to me at a restaurant they 're all thinking " Im sick of tipping these bitches all day . Fuck it . I stiff this one ! " and I 'm all , " But wait , my paycheck is only gon na be 68 cents " <p> Tell me , am I wrong ? Is this clearly not a desensitization ( major points for the six syllable word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pockets of those who rely solely on tips alone ? I say revolt . Pocket your spare change and save it for something that really matters . When the bagel guy gives you two dimes back as change , do n't  put it into that styrofoam cup taped to the register . You save it and give it to the next waiter you see . The guy who only makes $4.65 an hour and gets paychecks for 68- . <p> I think everyone should be a waiter for six months of their lives . It would make the world a much better place , I just know it . Most people have never waited tables or if they have they forgot how goddamn shitty it can be to depend on total strangers to pay your income . Do you know what waiters usually make hourly ? Less than minimum wage . I make $4.60 an hour . That means if I work 40 hours , I would only get $184 for the whole week . That does not even pay for my internets and phone service . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes on tips ( whether I get them or not ) and my paycheck is usually zero . That 's right , I said zero . Waiters pay taxes on a percent of their sales even if they got stiffed on a check . If I ring up a $75 check and Cunty McCuntcunt decides to leave only $5 , the government is still going to tax me as if I had gotten a 15% tip . Uh huh . I pay taxes on tips I do n't  even get . It sucks . Which is why customers must leave at least 15% for the tip . Some people are too stupid to figure it out , so they just leave 10% . Ignorance is not an excuse . If you need help , just double the tax so you would be leaving about 16% . Out of the tip that we are given then we have to tip out of it to the bartender and the food runner and the busser .

There was a time when I did not moderate comments and all was right in the world . But then there came a time when people started to hate me and the comments got mean , abusive and downright nasty . Not to mention , poorly written and misspelled . Someone I pissed off has begun to post comments with my place of employment and that simply will not do . I cant have people showing up at my job begging to sit in my station and then take me out for cocktails afterwards . It sounds good in theory , but probably not the best thing . Therefore , I began moderating the comments which is a big pain in my lazy ass . One message they sent me was that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me alone . Therein lies the rub . Apologize for what ?

All others will remain as the Earth falls into fiery chaos . I can only assume that I will be one left in the fiery chaos since , you know , I 'm a bitch and all that .

We will still have five months before the world ends and I suspect itll be pretty warm with all the fire and brimstone and shit . <p> Discard any plans you had for your Halloween costume because the world will be done on October 21st and you probably wont need a costume in hell . <p> Go to iTunes or YouTube and download Blondies " Rapture " or Anita Bakers " Caught Up in the Rapture " because I am pretty sure if you are playing one of those songs when God comes down , you get a " Get Out of Hell Free " card . <p> Since my birthday is May 29th , you should just go ahead and click here to give me my present now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the 7 train and the F train who screams about the Bible , just tell him , " Hey , can you save me a seat tomorrow ?

This vacation to South Beach , Miami had one purpose and one purpose only : relaxation . Each day I was there , the only decisions that had to be made were ones like " pool or beach " and " vodka or tequila . " I ate out for every meal and each time , my critical , and somewhat bloodshot , eyes were surveying my surroundings looking for all-star severs . <p> Staying at The Raleigh Hotel was amazing and the staff did not disappoint . The pool itself was the main reason we decided to stay there . Designed in 1940 for aquatic film star Esther Williams , it is a taste of pure art deco . I have always been a fan of Esther Williams and Busby Berkley so to swim in the same pool that she did made me quiver with excitement . Being there inspired me to simulate one of her signature " sideways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pool hoping to find a stray hair that may have once belonged to Ms. Williams , I am not sure I ever did . I found one short and curly dark one that may or may not have been one of hers but I pressed it into my memory book anyway . The pool is surrounded by chaise lounges and to those chaise lounges come wonderful people who brought me drinks , food and towels . Some of those people were Hillary , Nesh , Bobby , Michael , Ana , Rondo , and Rudy . I loved them . The tolerated me . They probably all went home to their blogs and wrote abut the skinny drunk bitch who kept trying to dive like Esther Williams . <p> While most of my drinks came from The Raleigh , I did occasionally venture out and experience other venues , all the while , keeping track of my cocktails and taking photos when I could . And here they are : <p> Tequila Mockingbird : Corzo blanco , red bell pepper , Serrano , cucumber- Golly , I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments after checking into the hotel . Nesh made it for me and as I sat at the bar drinking it , I met Ana , the restaurant manager . She was already cool , but as if she needed to prove it , two days later she comped us some amazing bread pudding in a peach and espresso sauce . <p> Caipirinha : Damn , I love these drinks . <p> Bottle of champagne : the hotel sent up a bottle of champagne to our room because we were there celebrating an anniversary . We drank it . <p> Tequila Mockingbird : still yummy . <p> Tequila Mockingbird <p> Tequila Mockingbird : still yummy . <p> Zeus : Ciroc vodka , peppercorn syrup , lime , cucumber , prosecco- This drink came to us via a restaurant called Catch .

I do n't know how he does it , but thank you . <p> Tequila Mockingbird : why ca n't I quit you ? <p> Bottle of champagne : the hotel sent us another bottle of champagne because they 're cool like that . We drank it . <p> champagne <p> Daiquiri : my one disappointing drink at some lame ass tapas bar on Espinola Way . Their menu sucked , the service sucked , and the drink sucked . But I drank it anyway . <p> Spicy Margarita : Jalape+o-infused tequila , cilantro and cucumber- back at the pool area one day , I discovered the only drink that could take me away from my Tequila Mockingbird .

It looked like she was on the hunt for sugar daddy . <p> Zeus : I could not stay away from Catch and went back one day to have one more of these delicious bitches . <p> Spicy Margarita : back at the pool , drinking tequila . Same ol ' same ol ' . <p> Chamomile Bees Knees : No. 3 Gin , chamomile honey syrup , lemon juice- this was from the martini lounge at The Raleigh .

Although it was a tight race between you and table 16 who told me they were so hungry that I should put down my water pitcher and take their order right away , your overall consistency of annoyingness took the lead . Kudos to you , assholes ! <p> When I say hello to a table , a nice response would be a salutation directed back at me and not " I want a cheeseburger . " That is just plain rude , sir , but I will blame that on your very advanced age and your need to eat one final meal before departing this earth . Of course , me being eager to please , I was ready to take your order and get that burger cooking as quickly as possible seeing that you must be severely underfed . However , no one else at your table , your wife or grown son , was ready to order because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slow the fuck down . Death may be knocking at your door , but I have a sequence of events I try to uphold . I went ahead and placed your well-done burger ( with cheddar , I decided , since you were in too big of a hurry to read the menu and make your own choice . ) I would come back momentarily to take the rest of the order . That 's annoying . <p> Finally , the other two people were ready to order . " Can I get the roast chicken ? " asked the man who was at least 35 years old . " But can you have the chef cut it up for me ? I do n't  have the use of my left elbow . " I did see that there was some fancy-looking-bionic-arm Steve Austin kind of contraption on it and let him know that the chicken comes out from the kitchen sliced . But that was n't good enough . He needed it to be cut into bite-sized pieces . The kitchen was already going to be annoyed with me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to ask the cook to cut the meat too . For Gods sake man , you 're sitting eighteen inches away from your mother , cant she do it ? Perhaps you would like me to chew it for you as well and then partially digest it and then regurgitate it directly into your mouth like a baby bird . Would that be helpful ? But I asked the cook to cut the chicken up and he hates me now a little bit more than before which I did n't  think was possible . <p> The old lady was n't hungry because she had already eaten a full dinner and a dessert before she came in . Too much information and I certainly did n't  need to hear it three times . A brandy and ginger ale for the lady . And without ice . Of course , maam . And of course you do n't  want ice . It would n't be table 15 without me having to type some extra shit into the computer notating your special needs . <p> When I returned with the brandy/ginger ale , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day is , old man . I would have told you earlier had you not ordered your cheeseburger before allowing me to announce the specials . And of course you want soup now . Another addition to your check is just what the kitchen wants from me . <p> Everything seemed fine after your food arrived ( at three different times ) so imagine my surprise when I saw you flagging me down fifteen minutes after the chicken made it to the table . I rushed over because I assumed you wanted a salad now or maybe some bread . But what 's this I see ? Your credit card ? You 're waving your credit card around as if I have made you wait forever to make payment . That is not the case . Customarily , I let my- tables enjoy their meal for at least twenty minutes before attempting to clear plates but you were in such a hurry to pay that you wanted it done right that very minute . I understand that when the grim reaper is breathing down your saggy neck , time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fuck out . <p> I was happy when you left , table 15 . I made far too many trips to your table for things that could have been condensed to one or- two visit and your neediness took time away from other tables . Thank you for the 12% tip . It was exactly what- I expected from you and you did not disappoint . . I am- happy to say- I was never rude to you and I was always respectful . Too bad you cant say the same .

That 's your job to get EVERY SINGLE THING THEY WANT AT THEIR WHIM . You do n't want to do that , do n't be a server ! ! It 's that simple ! <p> Hey Springs 1 , you do n't strike me as someone who has much experience in working in food service . You seem more experienced in being an insulting , obnoxious customer . When you go into a restaurant you are a customer , not an emperor . Good service not only depends on the server 's abilities to serve , but the customer 's abilities to listen to the server and allow them to pace the service adequately . Customers often do n't realize that there are steps of service . By not allowing your server to follow the steps accordingly , your service ultimately suffers . Why is it so irrational that a server would expect for their customers to be attentive and respectful ? Your behavior as a customer dictates your service , so I am not at all surprised at your comment : " That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-7 things at once . " ( Chances are your servers are consistently running away from your table because they are eager to get away from you . ) <p> Got tired of moderating comments so just yesterday stopped doing it . It 's like Springs1 sniffed out a " comment moderation disabled " switch and threw her ranch covered dildo out the window and made her way back to my blog . Moderating again . <p> I 've read this blog from the beginning and for the love of ranch dressing will someone punch Springs1 in the baby makerbut wear a glove that 's a scary , nasty , crabby place . I heart you Bitchy Waiter , you make my day somewhat tolerable ( seriously I deal with people that come into your restaurant ) . XOXO The Bitchy Concierge <p> " they wo n't write things down when I am saying a bunch of things they leave **BEFORE** I can get through my entire list of things I want to say . " that 's cause they wan na get away from you , your ranch dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate Springs1 . Shut the hell up . If you do n't want to read about servers talking about their jobs , here is an idea : DO N'T COME TO THIS BLOG . God forbid you see your time at a restaurant from the server 's point of view for once . We have all been customers , too , so we know it from both sides , that 's why we make awesome customers . We have understanding and patience . Do n't bother replying to this Springs1 , I have better things to do then read your 20 paragraph long , incoherent reply <p> People like you are absolutely ridiculous . You 're probably someone that drives us crazy . The point is that at any given time , a server probably has multiple things to do . You read these posts and comment on them , knowing nothing about the job . Servers do n't hate everyone . We 're not lazy . Throughout my day , if I have 20 tables there were usually a couple of people that really got on my nerves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SELECT FEW customers that need to calm the fuck down . It 's basic human communication skills that these customers lack . Patience . Kindness . Many people know that " ROLLS " or " COKE " are not proper responses to " Hi , how are you all doing tonight ? " . What we wish people would get from reading these posts is how not to act in a restaurant . I 've been serving since I was 16 years old . It bought me my first car and has put me through 4 years of college . I 'm a server because I need the flexibility and the money is decent . However , it would be great if customers , like yourself , would realize that we 're human . We can only do so much . You 're not my ONLY priority . We make $2.13 an hour busting our asses for your picky , ridiculous requests for what will most likely be a 10% tip . You really missed the point . Just be a decent human being , asshole . <p> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pessimistic ranting always makes my day better.Anyway ; this is my theory on Springs1 ; Springs1 knows that her comment are dumb as shit .

That 's your job to get EVERY SINGLE THING THEY WANT AT THEIR WHIM . You do n't want to do that , do n't be a server ! ! It 's that simple ! " Yeah , I think someone is a bit confused about just what a restaurant is . <p> I love your blog ! It confirms what I learned from my wonderful Mom that has served me well for 50+ years : treat people in service jobs with respect and kindness and they will repay it with excellent service , slight them or treat them like slaves and they will punish you if they can . I always get fantastic service when I return to a place where I 've eaten before and here 's how I do it : communicate with the server the same way I would with an important professional contact , listening attentively and expressing reasonable needs and desires clearly . Avoiding blaming or criticism . ( If something is wrong , I inform the service in a neutral way , for example , " I realize you did n't prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dirt on the lettuce . " ) Keeping in mind that I am not eating at home , so things may be prepared differently than I like them to be . I have to treat this as an opportunity to experience something new . And finally tip a minimum of 20% , more if the service is excellent . But here 's what on rare occasions makes me a mean customer who leaves only 10% : a server who persistently corrects me and argues with me . For example , saying things like " you have to expect dirt in an organic salad " ( I was really told this ! ) <p> Whoever left the comment " Seriously , quit complaining about being a slave to the customers . That 's your job to get EVERY SINGLE THING THEY WANT AT THEIR WHIM . You do n't want to do that , do n't be a server ! ! It 's that simple ! " You are clearly not in the service industry . You have NO idea what its like to have 35 tables a day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robot with no feelings or emotions . It is emotionally draining to have 80% of your customers demand things fromt you , expect you to be PERFECT , and people that think they are the only table in the whole place . So if servers wan na come on here and bitch about their horrible tables , LET US ! We all see the same bullshit everyday and it feels awesome to vent ! Oh and yes if serving is so horrible , we should get another job . Well unlike a lot of people , my parents are not paying for all of my college , housing , and food . So getting through college and getting a " real " job has not been a breeze . Therefore some of us must wait hand and foot to make your snotty ass family 's dining experience as pleasant as possible without telling you to " shut the fuck up and go to Mcdonalds " . <p> Some people just do n't understand that being rude and cheap will come back to bite you in the ass . I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a polite and generous ( albeit sometimes loud and boisterous ) drinkerYESYESYES ! ! It 's funny how that works eh ?

My server came to the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we do n't  have fries anymore and if you want mussels , I need to tell them right now before they put them away . " I looked around the restaurant and saw the candles were blown out and the bartender counting the drawer . " Are you guys closing early tonight ? I asked . <p> " We close at 10:00 on Monday nights , dude . " <p> Oh my God , I was that person . I thought they closed at 11:00 . No wonder my manager gave me a stinkier eye than usual . I was mortified . " Oh fuck , I 'm leaving . " <p> " No , we can make you something to eat , do n't  worry about it . What do you want ? " said the server . <p> No . I was done . Embarrassed , I crawled out of the booth and apologized to the cooks and my manager who now had a big happy grin on his face knowing that I was leaving . They must have thought I was being a total prick showing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A couple of days later , I was going to see a Broadway show . ( Porgy and Bess . You should go see it . ) I knew where I wanted to go for dinner afterwards so I called to see how late they were open seeing I still had deep seeded shame from my last restaurant appearance . " We close at midnight , " was the reply . Perfect . The show was over at 10:40 so I could be there by 11:00 , eat a quick bite and be out by closing time . There were three of us when we walked in at 11:02 . " Table for four ? " the skinny-jeaned Shaggy from Scooby Doo looking server asked us . " Sit anywhere you like . " We chose a table and sat down and two seconds later the server was there with menus . " Um , just so you know we close in like five minutes , so its like last call , like right now . Whadaya want ? " <p> " Wait , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight and they told me midnight . " <p> " Yeah , we decided to close early so were closing now . But you can still order . If you want . I guess . " <p> What the hell ? I am not going to stay when the servers is already copping an attitude with me for getting there at their newly declared closing time . " No that 's alright , I 'm not staying when I know you are closed . " <p> " Okay , " said the waiter . He flicked his long black hair out of his eyes and turned on his Pixie Boot heel with the menus tucked under his tattooed arms and graphic t-shirt . <p> Really ? I went to another restaurant right at closing time ? What was wrong with me ? We wandered down Ninth Avenue to find someplace to eat . We saw a place that had people inside which seemed like a good indicator that they were still open . We stuck our head in hesitantly ? " Are you open ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Can we get a table ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> All seemed good . A man brought us menus . " Sorry they 're all wet , but the hostess just wiped them all down before she left . Your server will be right with you . " <p> He was right with us , clearly in a hurry . He took our drink order , took our food order , brought out the drinks , brought out the food , did his check-back , offered another round of drinks , cleared plates , offered us dessert and coffee which we declined and he brought us the check in record time . I think he was ready to go home . We gave him credit cards and he brought them back lickety split . As soon as we signed them he reappeared . " Do you mind if I take those now so I can run my report ? " He reached over , took the receipts and we saw him leave three minutes later . <p> What was happening to me ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from closing ? I felt bad about it . I hate when people do that to me and now I had done it three times in one week . The only way I can rectify this situation is to change my eating habits and start eating dinner at 5:00 PM and take advantage of the Early Bird Specials . I am on my way to work now and I know that karma is going to bite me in the ass . Tonight , these two bitchesare going to show up in my station . And you know what ? I will deserve it . 109839 @qwx969839 109836 @qwx969836 <h> 17 thoughts on " I Am a Bad Person ( But You Already Knew That ) " <p> So much for " a city that does n't sleep . " I would say that you were n't the bad person , they were lousy business people . The first place should have laughed at you lovingly for not knowing your own restaurant 's schedule . The other two places falsely advertised their hours . No bad on you . Screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 've earned some late night Karma over the years . You should have stayed.I like to bring a small chainsaw with me to work and at the end of the night when someone comes in to ask if they can still get a drink , I lightly tap my chainsaw sitting on the bar and say , " Absolutely ! Stay as long as you like . Stay FOREVER ! " And then I laugh like the Count on Sesame Street . Works every time . <p> I work at a concept resturant where " service with scarcasm " is our motto , personally I enjoy every last minute table I get . Unfortunatly the customers who come in 5 minutes before we close do not . I assure you that I 've broken that habit for a lot of them . I even have gone as far as to have my 250 lb line cook come out and deliver their food with the most pleasant attitude in the world . I 've been that person and yes it does suck but the fact of the matter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're gunna feed ya ' . But I do n't have to smile and be nice about it " hurry up and order so I can go get drunk " has been spoken more than once . Do n't worry about being that person worry about getting a server like me = <p> Not at my place Bitchy I wo n't tolerate an unwelcome feeling guest . Same treatment at 5:00 and at 9:59 or 10:00 . It does n't really matter seems often times there is a guest seated 2 hours before closing still sitting 40 min after closing apologizing but not moving . So seat the late table and make some money what is an hour . <p> You know , it happens . Sometimes , luck is just against us , but at least every one of those experiences avoided blowing up in your face . Monday at your own restaurant , meh , an honest mistake ( althoughcome on , not knowing your place of employment 's own hours ? Major lols there , dude ) . And , that other place that was closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think twice.I once went into a sushi restaurant that I went to often , and it just so happened they closed in an hour . So , no big deal , we go in for a quick appetizer before a midnight movie screening , and they treated us terribly . Constantly asking us if we wanted the bill , tossing it on the table when we said we were n't ready for it yet ( as our food had JUST arrived ) , and then as we left , telling ( not asking ) us not to come back so close to closing next time . I was miffed , but once again , meh . It 's part of the business , as you well know . Heck , at my restaurant , we get late-comers all the time . It 's gotten to the point where we 're surprised if we -don't- get some white trash hooligans at two seconds to locked-doors . <p> It happens to the best of us . Having a great deal of food allergies and being a vegan , I mean , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two restaurants I can eat at . I ca n't tell you how many times I 've gone to one of them five minutes before closing time to grab a little something to go . I make it quick , and tip well . <p> Well , at restaurant #2 , you did do your due diligence . You called ahead and they misrepresented their hours . No reason you should feel guilty , and , quite honestly , I would have mentioned it to a manager . Not good business there ! <p> You do not deserve it ! You were more than nice to have left the restaurant that closed early on you , although you called previously to verify the closing time . So many people would have stayed and intentionally made the server pay for that mistake . As a server , you left . You will still have plenty of rude customers , but not because you deserve them ! <p> My manager would feed anyone that showed up 5 min before closing . However , I have made some of my best tips on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . They were mostly polite and quiet . We just played video poker and listen to music since we would be finished cleaning our stations by then . <p> What restaurant closes early ? The only time Ive ever seen one do that was this one I worked at last year , and they only did it because it was New Years Eve and no one had come in for two hours . And they still only closed 15 minutes early , not a whole hour . And it really really sucks when people know we close in a minute and still act like its nothing , especially when they do n't  want to pay out within an hour . What really really sucks though is when they decide to close late . another restaurant I used to work at would just not close if people were still coming in at closing time . I quit that place after this one night when we were supposed to close at 11 but the manager would n't lock the door until 12:30. 
@@106055433 @1455433/ <h> Let Us Review : Butter NYC <p> Its Restaurant Week here in New York City and I took advantage of it . Restaurant Week is something that gets customers to go out to eat even though there are ice storms , frigid temperatures and old man winter is all up in our ass cracks . Restaurants create a special prix fixe menu and for $35 a person , you can get three courses at places that are usually much much more expensive than that . I ate at Butter . The executive chef of Butter is Alex Guarnaschelliwho is always popping up on the Food Network . I wanted to go there because she seems cool on TV , the menu looked good and with a name like " Butter " how could it be anything but rich and delicious ? It was rich and delicious . Since I am not a food expert but I am a service expert , I have decided to review my service and only briefly mention my food : <p> Butternut squash soup : warm , silky , sweet , filling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garlic and red mustard : the pork was so damn good and whatever that sauce was needed a straw so I could drink it . The skillet potato was good but it looked and tasted like a hash brown from McDonalds . ( That is not a complaint . ) The greens were greens . I did n't  eat them.Side of mashed potatoes : the most buttery smooth mashed potatoes I have ever had . They reminded me of the mashed potatoes in a Swanson frozen dinner . ( And that is not a complaint . ) Dark chocolate torte with whipped sour cream : of course it was good . Chocolate torte . Duh . <p> And now the service . First the hostesses . They were all like really pretty , like oh my god , like do you have a reservation , like , we will be with you in a minute , like thank you for coming in . The usual restaurant hostesses . Whatever . <p> At the bar , the bartender was also gorgeous so she probably had sent in a photo with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citron , pomegranate liqueur , Cointreau and a splash of pineapple . She made them perfectly and at one point I saw her with two cocktail shakers in her hands and she was going to town with them . It looked like she was having a really good time . <p> My waiter left a lot to be desired . I do n't  need a lot of service when I go out . I really do n't  . But when eating at a highly rated place like Butter , I guess I expected a more attentive server who did the basic things that I learned back at Bennigans . When the soup came out , I asked the runner for more bread . It never came . I assumed I would just ask the server when he came in for his two-minute check back . But he never came over . Cmon . Even at Pizzeria Uno I had to go back within two minutes to make sure the pizza skins were alright . But at this high falutin place , the waiter does n't  do two-minute check back ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made again . It eventually came . After the soup bowl was cleared , I expected a crumber at the table . It never came . Again , its not like I crumb my table at home , but when I see waiters , runners , back waiters and managers walking around , I sorta thought someone would come and wipe up the fucking cornbread crumbs . No biggie . Whatever . Order another martini . The entree was great . He checked in on the table and I was all good . By now , martini number two was getting hold of me . Coffee was ordered and it took forever to get there . I saw the waiter talking in the sidestand so I knew that there must be a coffee person making it in exchange for a tip out . The dessert came and the plates were placed on the table with care . And then they stayed there . Once the plates were empty , he asked how everything was . " So good , thank you , " I responded . He smiled and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busser to clear the table . I asked for the check . The plates stayed . I paid the check . The plates stayed . He returned the credit card and the plates stayed . I was really surprised that no one took those damn fucking plates . I signed the card while holding the check presenter in my lap because the table had dirty fucking plates on it . He returned to pick up the credit voucher and still ignored the plates . What the hell ? If I was eating at TGIFridays sure , but Butter ? <p> I figured the rules would be all strict here but based on the things I saw , its pretty relaxed . For instance : <p> the bartender texting on her phone . <p> the waiter leaning against the sidestand and talking with a friend . <p> placing my dessert spoon on the left side of the table . ( minor , I know , but I have worked at places that we were not allowed to do that . ) <p> pouring water after picking up the glass with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diner on Eighth Avenue ? <p> the two hostesses sitting on a banquette as I left , each of them texting on their phones . ( Maybe they were texting the bartender . ) <p> having to ask for the water to be filled two different times . ( again not a big deal , but if there are a dozen people on the floor , that shouldnt happen , right ? ) <p> Overall , I completely enjoyed my meal . Maybe the service was sub par because they were not giving 100% for all of us losers who came in for Restaurant Week , but I was disappointed with that . We have all heard it before : we go to a restaurant the first time for the food only but the second time we go its for the food and the service . If the service is n't where it should be , then it detracts from the food . Does anyone else agree with me on that ? I feel like when you pay a lot of money for a meal , you are paying for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two people . That 's a lot of money . If I am going to spend that much on one meal , I do n't  want to have to be looking around for more water and lay my arm in cornbread crumbs . Of course I left a 20% tip . I just couldnt do less , but my waiter did n't  go above and beyond . Would I go back ? Maybe someday . But if the service was better it would be much more likely . <h> 23 thoughts on " Let Us Review : Butter NYC " <p> I live in Australia and the only reason I know what Butter is , is because it 's on Gossip Girl ( I know , I ca n't help it ) . This is such a disappointment . Hopefully they are just doing it because of ' restaurant week ' . We 're not allowed to accept tips in Perth : /They should be lucky to get something , let alone work at Butter , in New York . Jeez <p> In this small town there is one local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday and Cracker Barrel . I know , I know ! However , even at Ruby Tuesday , I expect bread WITH the meal and water refills . Not getting those two needs filled can ruin my meal . Everyone knows the food quality ( excellent imho ) and price ( not a lot ) . But , just get my bread and water in a timely manner . <p> Not picking up the plates pisses me off ! I refuse to pay the check until they do . I will stack them and push them to the edge of the table if I have to . BUT pick up the fucking plates . I do n't eat at diners , but I 'm pretty sure they pick up the plates . I would n't go back , well maybe , if the food was as good as you said , I 'd probably go back . And I 'm a sucker too , I leave 20% even for bad service , do n't want to look cheap . <p> Great post , as usual Bitchy . Too bad you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been a memorable one . Thanks for the laugh , amidst the complainingIt always makes me smile . Cheers mate ! <p> Holy canolie ! I have never spent that much at a restaurant ( more the diner type welcome to middle America , where you have to drive 2 hours to any place that would ever be called " falutin ' . " It 's frustrating no matter where you are if there are service staff standing around and you 've got a dirty table . I have almost always received excellent service at little diners . The service starts to get shitty when I go to chains : ( Yakkety yak . Your complaints are legit . <p> Restaurant week or not , it 's to make you want to come back again when the prices are back to normal . No excuse for that kind of service . I would have at least talked to a manager . Not to get something for free , but to inform her/him of what 's going on . <p> I understand the dilemma with the plates . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did , however , find one that iced the cake.The server came over to give me my check , put someone else 's plates down on my table to hand me the check . I was appalled . The rest of the service had been poor ( asking multiple times for refills and finally walking to the bar and asking the bar tender if she would be kind enough to finally give me something to friggin drink ) , food was messed up , and had to wait twenty minutes to even find someone to get the food started to be fixed ) , etc . I saw the waitress literally twice . When she took our order , and brought the drinks back . Someone else brought us our food , someone else fixed the messed up food order , and we had to get the check from the manager , because the girl never showed up again . That was the only time in my life that I have left no tip whatsoever.The bartender , however , got five bucks for filling my drink . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good service . Just ate at Adrienne 's Pizza Bar in the Financial District the other night and the water was never lower than half before it was refilled by a specific water guy , the waiter refilled our wine from the bottle we ordered , and services was all around perfect . I felt compelled to tip $15 on a $50 check . Too bad about Butter , bitchy . Hopefully they will shape up ! <p> Terrible service . When this happens to me I will bus my own table by putting the dirty plates on an empty table near by . Or stack them precariously and leave them teetering on the edge of my table . ( I 'm helpful that way ) Also , I would not have left more than 10% . <p> The greens were greens . I did n't eat them.A man after my own heart.So , dinner was $35 . I assume there were two of you , which means $70 on dinner . You said the total , incliding tip , was $169 . That would mean you spent about $70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bitchy SHAME on you ! Why did you leave 20% Why could n't your talented paw stop at 15 even 18 . I was at 19.5 until the dirty plates . NOT gon na work . Principles darling how will they ever learn if you keep paying them for substandard service . I might have stayed at 20 but quipped of a REAL bitchy comment that would have embarrassed yet not surprised my guest . I would have felt like I paid for it.PLEASE come to our restaurant and give us the business . See how our service stands up . I LOVE the attention to every detail . Yes , some no biggy but still NOTICED . I think it will be fun for all of us . You might be over served ( cocktails we have cabs ) but no dirty plates . yuck . You will like the food too.Reservations recommended . = <p> Ok , no that is unacceptable service . Maybe its cuz I 'm from the south where a crumber is well I 've never heard of it , but I can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have to ask for refills let alone 2xs , plates are taken so we can talk/study/order more later , and When I ask the randon busboy who speaks no english if he can run some more creamer for my coffee by the table on his way back the server brings it to me immediately in a big bowl all this at IHOP Tuesday at 11:30pm . If IHOP can get it right then a wtf is wrong with the people at Butter . Maybe they do get paid real wages or something so they do n't think they have to work . <p> sounds like you got the $35 prix fix special . restaurant week is for suckers , did you order anything else ? ? u know the last time i checked most restaurants offer the same $35 prix fix menu at lunch or pre theater <p> i love that i have only read a few of your posts , and here i was thinking you were all " pro-server. " not to say you are n't , but i could n't help but wonder what sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here it is. " why would you leave 20% ? they will never learn if you continue to tip them .. " " i ca n't stand to have my own dirty plates sit in front of me so i move them to another table .. " gross ! tipping should never be seen as a voluntary/charitable contribution , no matter the service . people get busy people can not always perform the job at max standards , but when you are standing in line at the gap getting frustrated that service is slow you do not refuse to pay for the goods . at a restaurant , service is part of the goods.as a seasoned server , i know what to expect and when i am being short changed , but i also know how it feels to be so fucking frantic that i can not give my best to a table . i expect the general public to play the dumb , " everything should always be 100% perfect when i go out to eat " card ( despite the fact that every single one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALSO makes mistakes but does not have clients deduct money from their services because they had to ask for something ( water ) ) but this is not a card servers should play . 20% should be the minimum , and that 20% should be given with the benefit of the doubt .

LONG ... 14 Mar 2012 17:59:00 LONG ... occasion , I will write about an outstanding server I had so the world will know that there are actually people who wait tables who go above and beyond the expectations of their guests and do it all with a smile and a wonderful attitude , unlike me who will take notes about your dining experience and then go home and blog about your ass . This is really about two such servers on opposite sides of the country . One is named Tia who works at the Sapphire Hotel in Portland , Oregon and the other is named Ashley who works at Dutch Kills Bar in Long Island City , Queens . Truth be told , I am not sure that Ashley was her name . I had a few cocktails that night and my brain was all mushy when I left , so maybe it was Samantha . Or Melissa ? Honestly , shell never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Tia , she was not actually my server but a friend of mine who lives in Portland told me that she was amazing . Tia and Ashley/Samantha/ Melissa , this is for you : <p> ( Since I did n't  experience the service that Tia provided , her story is 99% fiction ) <p> Tia was incredible . She did n't  just walk to the table , she floated to it like she was a hovercraft with a cocktail tray . Her smile was brighter than Dr. Phils bald ass head and her hair was prettier than Paula Deens . No this has nothing to do with how she served the drinks , but a compliment is a compliment and since I was n't really there , I have no idea . Her hair looked like it was spun from gold . Like Rumpelstiltskin had just gotten a new batch of hay and spun it directly onto her head . Her uniform was perfectly pressed and she manged to hold forty five glasses at one time when she was bussing a nearby table . ( I was n't there , remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by looking at them . " So let me see , " she said . " It looks like we will be needing two Jack and Cokes , a Bud Light and apple and pear cosmo with a splash of St. Germain for the gay guy in the corner , is that it ? Oh and I am going to give you all separate checks because I can tell that you guys are pretty good friends but one of you has a habit of not putting enough money down and screwing everybody else . Ill be right back . " She floated off and three seconds later she materialized with the drinks and a complimentary plate of nachos " with the jalapenos on the side because two of you are going to get really trashed tonight and make out in the parking lot . Anything else you need ? " she asked . Everyone at the table was mesmerized by her all-knowing personae . The gay guy in the corner was hoping he was one of the people who would be making out in the parking lot later so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was amazing . <p> As for Ashley , I watched her as she put up with the flirtatious behavior of a much older man in her station . He was coming on to her and even though she was not interested , she let the old man get his jollies as she smiled and laughed at his jokes . I was n't sure what I wanted to drink and told her that it could be bartenders choice . My only criteria was " vodka " and " citrusy . " She returned with a mint and cucumber concoction that was out of this world . She told me what it was called and how it was made , but if I cant remember her name , do you really think I will remember the name of a cocktail ? When we mentioned we were hungry , she whisked off and returned with a folder full of take-out menus . " You can order in , we do n't  mind . " We asked for a suggestion and she told us that the bar-b-q place was very good and very meaty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large plates of meat , she said , " See what I mean ? Meaty ! I 'll bring you some water . " She brought us our second round and we chatted about the lech across the aisle who had since left . <p> Meanwhile , back with Tia , when it was time to clear the tables she did so by repelling from the ceiling and removing the glassware as she hung upside down . " I did n't  want to bother anyone , " she explained . <p> Ashley removed our trash from out takeout order and had our check in her hand . " I 'm not rushing you , but I have your check if you 're ready to go . After a pound of brisket , I 'd wan na go home and take a nap . " She was right . We thanked her for her foresight and paid the check . <p> Whe Tia showed up with the checks , she thanked everyone for coming in . She gave a knowing wink to the two people she knew would be making out in the parking lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone number of another waiter who thought he was cute in that Gay Guy in the Corner kind of way . Tia was amazing . <p> We tipped Ashley 25% . <p> Tia was tipped 25% . <p> Each waitress went home from work that night satisfied that they had given wonderful service to their customers . Job well done , Tia and Ashley . ( Or was it Emily ? ) <p> Do you remember the name of a great server you had once ? 109839 @qwx969839 
@@106055435 @1455435/ <h> Grumpy Old Man Alert : <p> Renovations are happening at my job so things have been a bit dusty at work lately . We are n't  closing down as these changes happen so each day we show up for work , we never know what to expect . Plaster on the silverware ? Whatever . Paint spilled on the carpet ? Walk around it . The handrails to the stairs still tacky with the new stain ? Stop right there , because that was a huge problem for an old man who bit my head off with the same ease he probably yells at kids to get off of his lawn . <p> There were signs all over the fucking place that said things like " Please pardon our appearance as we renovate " and " Please avoid using the handrail since it was newly painted today . " The signs were clearly visible for anyone who did n't  have an Occupy Cataract situation going on with their pupils . That may have been the problem with the old man . Seeing that he smelled like a bucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle mist of Metamucil , it would not be shocking to learn that his eyesight was a bit cloudy . I was at the foot of the stairs waiting for him to make his way down when he yelled out at me , " Goddamn , what the hell is going on with these rails ? " I looked at his hands and saw they were covered in a beautiful mahogany stain that will really make the new purple color on the walls pop . <p> " Oh , I 'm sorry sir . Some of the woodwork was stained today and its still a bit sticky . I do apologize . " <p> " Well , you ought to put up a goddamn sign , " he croaked out at me . <p> " We did , sir . " I pointed at a sign that was next to me . <p> " Well , you need to put one at the top of the stairs , not down here where its too late . " My eyes went to the sign at the top of the stairs and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . There were three signs in total . <p> " I 'm sorry . I think there is at least one sign up there , sir- " <p> " Well , I did n't  see it , " he interrupted . He thrust his dirty hands out to emphasize his point . <p> " Well , I did , " I said and help up my nice clean hands to emphasize my point . " The mens room is down the hall on your right hand side , sir . " He grumbled something that I could n't understand but it did n't  matter because I had no intention of responding to it anyway . Seconds later , I heard the man caterwauling . <p> " Arrgh , I cant get this door open ! Wheeze , why wont this door open ? ? " <p> " Thats a closet , sir . The restroom is down the hall and on your other right hand side . " <p> He fumbled his way down the hall where I assume he washed his hands and bled his lizard . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two reasons . Number one , he was n't in my station . Number two , there 's only room enough for one grumpy old man in that place and that grumpy old man is me . <p> So if you happen to show up at my job , please be aware that it might be dusty , the woodwork might be sticky and the paint on the wall may not be dried , but its all so that we can make it nicer for our guests . However , if you get some wet paint on your coat , I wont tell you about it . Its too much effort for me . One time while waiting for the F train , I saw a sign that said " wet paint " on all the columns . There was a man who obviously did not read the sign because he had leaned against a pole and now had a green strip of paint down the side of his jacket . It was also on the side of his face . I watched him as he realized it was all over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face as well . I debated whether or not to tell him . I mean , I knew there was nothing he could do about it , right ? And if I told him , he would just spend his whole commute to work thinking about the fact that his face had green paint all over it and he would feel awkward and embarrassed , right ? So I did n't  tell him . The F train pulled into the station and I let him get on it thinking the only think he had to be self-conscious about was his coat having paint on it . Never mind it looked like he was doing his best Wicked Witch of the West impersonation . He sat down and I watched people look at him and think " Does he know he has paint all over his face ? " I often wonder what he felt like when he showed up to work complaining about the paint on his jacket when someone was like , " Yeah , douche bag , its all over your fucking face too .

I 'm working in retail in a small clearance store for my usual employers and despite the numerous signs through out the store , the large red one at the entrance and the one on the back of the registers that all say CASH ONLY people wait until I finish ringing everything up to ask if I take credit cards.Goodluck with the renovations and do n't lean on any columns = <p> The restaurant I work at recently renovated as well , as did the one beside us immediately afterwards . As all the servers tend to migrate to the other bar after ther shifts , we tend to swap stories . What I 've learne from such globalized gossip trade is this:Signs are for smart people.That 's the only way I can explain how SO MANY PEOPLE would blatantly ignore all the signs around the restaurant , inside and out , regarding the renovations . We had a giant sign outside saying " We Are Still Open As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly walk right by that giant sign otuside , poke their head through the open doorway , look at the hostess working there , and ask if we were still open . Wet paint was a different problem , one that both people and servers were caught off-guard by . I found that the servers were simply on autopilot and would lean against the same old wall they usually do when they have a moment , forgetting that it was damp with oil-based paint . On one occasion , however , I witnessed a guest of the establishment LOOK directly at the sign saying ' wet paint ' , look at me , and then put their hand on the wall to test the sign 's truth . When their hand became a delightful new shade of shit-brown , they complained to a manager and had their meal comped.Stupidity . It gets shit DONE . <p> I just have to test to see if the paint is really wet.I can not resist . Okay , it is weird . But , I do not want to rest on a painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restaurant that would stay open during renovations . I do n't want to deal with plaster and paint while I eat . I tend to just back out when I see work in progress . Once , I complained at a restaurant . The waiter said , " You ought to see what is in the back where we prepare this food . " <p> Nobody reads signs . You can put up all the signs you want about your electronic payment going down and there will always be people telling you you need to put up signs and then act like complete assholes like we invented this problem just to annoy them . They ca n't even read menu boards . I suppose it would be too much to ask that they read a sign put there for their own good.I had a man argue with me this weekend that I gave him a small coffee and he ordered a medium . I sat a small cup next to his medium so he could see the difference for himself and he still accused me of scamming him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I smiled at him but said nothing until he walked himself away from me.And they talk to us like we 're the stupid ones . 
@@106055436 @1455436/ <h> Yes , Virginia . There Really Are Good Servers . <p> On occasion , I will write about an outstanding server I had so the world will know that there are actually people who wait tables who go above and beyond the expectations of their guests and do it all with a smile and a wonderful attitude , unlike me who will take notes about your dining experience and then go home and blog about your ass . This is really about two such servers on opposite sides of the country . One is named Tia who works at the Sapphire Hotel in Portland , Oregon and the other is named Ashley who works at Dutch Kills Bar in Long Island City , Queens . Truth be told , I am not sure that Ashley was her name . I had a few cocktails that night and my brain was all mushy when I left , so maybe it was Samantha . Or Melissa ? Honestly , shell never read this so it does n't  really matter . As for Tia , she was not actually my server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that she was amazing . Tia and Ashley/Samantha/ Melissa , this is for you : <p> ( Since I did n't  experience the service that Tia provided , her story is 99% fiction ) <p> Tia was incredible . She did n't  just walk to the table , she floated to it like she was a hovercraft with a cocktail tray . Her smile was brighter than Dr. Phils bald ass head and her hair was prettier than Paula Deens . No this has nothing to do with how she served the drinks , but a compliment is a compliment and since I was n't really there , I have no idea . Her hair looked like it was spun from gold . Like Rumpelstiltskin had just gotten a new batch of hay and spun it directly onto her head . Her uniform was perfectly pressed and she manged to hold forty five glasses at one time when she was bussing a nearby table . ( I was n't there , remember ? ) She knew what everyone wanted to drink just by looking at them . " So let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will be needing two Jack and Cokes , a Bud Light and apple and pear cosmo with a splash of St. Germain for the gay guy in the corner , is that it ? Oh and I am going to give you all separate checks because I can tell that you guys are pretty good friends but one of you has a habit of not putting enough money down and screwing everybody else . Ill be right back . " She floated off and three seconds later she materialized with the drinks and a complimentary plate of nachos " with the jalapenos on the side because two of you are going to get really trashed tonight and make out in the parking lot . Anything else you need ? " she asked . Everyone at the table was mesmerized by her all-knowing personae . The gay guy in the corner was hoping he was one of the people who would be making out in the parking lot later so he downed his cocktail and another one appeared immediately . Tia was amazing . <p> As for Ashley , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a much older man in her station . He was coming on to her and even though she was not interested , she let the old man get his jollies as she smiled and laughed at his jokes . I was n't sure what I wanted to drink and told her that it could be bartenders choice . My only criteria was " vodka " and " citrusy . " She returned with a mint and cucumber concoction that was out of this world . She told me what it was called and how it was made , but if I cant remember her name , do you really think I will remember the name of a cocktail ? When we mentioned we were hungry , she whisked off and returned with a folder full of take-out menus . " You can order in , we do n't  mind . " We asked for a suggestion and she told us that the bar-b-q place was very good and very meaty . Thirty minutes later as we were staring at our embarrassingly large plates of meat , she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some water . " She brought us our second round and we chatted about the lech across the aisle who had since left . <p> Meanwhile , back with Tia , when it was time to clear the tables she did so by repelling from the ceiling and removing the glassware as she hung upside down . " I did n't  want to bother anyone , " she explained . <p> Ashley removed our trash from out takeout order and had our check in her hand . " I 'm not rushing you , but I have your check if you 're ready to go . After a pound of brisket , I 'd wan na go home and take a nap . " She was right . We thanked her for her foresight and paid the check . <p> Whe Tia showed up with the checks , she thanked everyone for coming in . She gave a knowing wink to the two people she knew would be making out in the parking lot momentarily and then she gave Gay Guy in the Corner the phone number of another waiter who thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of way . Tia was amazing . <p> We tipped Ashley 25% . <p> Tia was tipped 25% . <p> Each waitress went home from work that night satisfied that they had given wonderful service to their customers . Job well done , Tia and Ashley . ( Or was it Emily ? ) <p> Do you remember the name of a great server you had once ? 109839 @qwx969839 109836 @qwx969836 <h> 12 thoughts on " Yes , Virginia . There Really Are Good Servers . " <p> Lisa was the last server ( she was really the bartender , since we like to sit at the bar ) ( I like sitting in tall seats . = ) and she was very good . She had a " motherly " essence about her , in that if you screwed around or were rude to her , she would have no problem pulling you over her knee and putting you in the corner for time out . I do n't mess with servers , since I was one , but you do n't want to mess with Lisa either.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , so she looked me dead in the eyes and said " are you okay ? " Emphasis on that ( since I ca n't use Italics here , apparently . ) I said " yes , ma'am " Because I am polite like that.Seriously , though . She was good . She was very nice . And by the look she gave me , I think she wanted to seat me in the corner for a good 5 minutes . x.x <p> Back , way back , in the day when I was a cocktail waitress I was absolutely that good . Most of the Portland servers nowadays are not that stellar because it seems they really wish they were pursuing whatever they received their higher education for and/or they are just too cool for this job but the one I had yesterday at Pastini was perfectly fine . <p> Bitchy Waiter , I have a questionFirst of all I LOVE your blog . Read it everyday . Second , I work as a hostess in a restaurant so I can relate to so many of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about cheap-ass customers who leave 7% tips for great service , and I know how frustrating that can be . I hate cheap-ass people , too ! But what do you do if the service truly does suck ? ? I 've been out to eat at times where I 'm conflicted because I know the server needs those tips to live off of , yet they were just so inattentive that I do n't want to leave them much of MY hard earned money . I 'm not a high maintenance guest AT ALL , but simple things like not getting to the table for 11 minutes after we 're seated or having to ask for more water three times is unacceptable . Help ! <p> Lauren , I 'm not Bitchy , but I 've often wondered the same thing . We usually tip 25-30% for good service . As a rule , I wo n't leave less than 15% unless the ONLY time I see my server is when he takes my order and when he brings me my check . Then he might get 10% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give 15% because we do n't know why the server was bad . It might just be an off night , or his grandma might have just died . I like to give the benefit of the doubt . <p> Miss Lauren:In the situation where the service is sub-par and you wonder about what tip is appropriate I personally believe in tipping the customary 15-20 percent and then alerting management to the situation and having a dish on the bill comped.Here 's why : Management should know if they 're employing shitty people . Just stiffing a waiter does n't improve the restaurant or the service . If the restaurant feels that your experience was indisputably bad they will have lost money by comping your bill and it will prompt them to avoid this in the future by reprimanding the offensive server . However , if they feel that the shitty service you received is not sub-par according to their standards , than at least the server will have been tipped and paid for doing the job ( up to standard ) and it will be the restaurant that suffers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards.Unless you saw your waiter standing around with no other tables blatantly ignoring you , chances are they were doing something somewhere that fell into the category of work , and therefore they still deserve to be paid for it . It 's regrettable that your service was terrible but it 's better to hold the restaurant responsible . <p> Brandy.She worked at Denny ; s just after baby # 3 was born . Clearly , she was in rehab or something . She had a heart of gold but you just KNEW she had a sad story.She always made a big fuss about my kids even though they were kids . And messy . We tipped well , but I think she really liked kids.One day , we went to dinner there . Brandy was there . She was our server . She brought our meals , then my #2 son threw up all over everything and everyone . My husband picked him up like a live hand grenade and ran out of the restaurant . He puked the whole way out.Brandy came to the table with a cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it " . She packed up our order and gave me the $20 ticket.I tipped her $20 . Because she had to clean up PUKE and acted like it did n't phase her AT ALL.We never saw her again.True , we waited a few weeks to show our faces again , but I like to think that the decent tip was the ticket she needed to launch a better life . Either that or she said " Fuck this , I would rather go back to being a crack whore than to clean up puke again " . She really was awesome . <p> Godwin yes , that is his name and he always waited on us at Bob Evan 's where we went for lunch b/c it was close to work . Just absolutely the best . I miss him . Remembering back I think I can honestly say the 3 best servers I have ever had worked for Bob Evan 's . We do go to other restaurants and bars , but Godwin , Christina and Nafka always get/got 30% . We did recently find a newish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional very good at his job too . He gets 30% also . What can I say I am a former server myself and when you eat breakfast out the check does n't amount to as much as dinner . <p> Once when I was with my boyfriend and his family we had this really upbeat server . She had a good sense of humor and laughed at my boyfriend 's dad 's jokes . She got me extra napkins because I got a sandwich that had a ton of sauce . It 's refreshing to see a server goes the extra mile . <p> Darin , and i loved him because i could see his eyes roll every time my mother looked through her glass to be aure he had n't  given her tap water , god forbid , and then was sure to walk away when he laughed at her for ordering gnocchi when she did n't  know what it was , which was better then i did because we had tried to explain , but in her all knowingness she had blown us off . = we tipped 25% just for.the show 
@@106055438 @1455438/ <h> Category Archives : how do blind people count their money <p> I got a really shitty tip last night . Like shitty shitty covered in dog poop kinda shitty . And I was so nice to these people too . Booth one was seated with two people ; a blind man and a sighted man . ( Sounds like a joke , right ? A blind guy walks into a bar , see ) They told me they were waiting for two more people who were habitually late . The show was full and to start at 7:00 , so I wanted their asses there as soon as possible . It was a busy night and I did n't  have time to deal with latecomers . Five minutes before showtime , their guests walked in guided by a dog . They were both blind . They were seated and Lonny , the dog found his home at the side of the table . Booth one is right at the front of the room and every time a server has to walk to their station , they have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big black guide dog to be , but we did n't  know so that 's where they sat . The dog was sweet as hell but we had to step over it about twenty times throughout the night . I got drinks for the Johnny-Come-Latelys being very careful to place them in a way that they would know where they were . You know , since they cant see and all . All evening they were very pleasant to me and we were talking and connecting . All was good . Until they paid the bill . <p> Their bill was $202 . The sighted man gave me $101 in cash and asked for the difference to be put on a credit card . I counted the cash and despite it being almost all five dollar bills , it was in fact $101 . I ran the card and he signed it without leaving a tip . I assumed that the tip would be in cash . A few minutes later , Mr. Sight came up to me to hand me my tip personally . " I 'm sorry , its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head while raising his eyebrows and pouting his lips . ( Do that please : shrug , tilt , raise , pout . See what it looks like ? ) " Oh do n't  worry about that , " I said . And I meant it too . Until I looked down and saw two dollars . Two . Dollars . Wait , what ? 1% ? One mother fucking percent ? I watched him as he helped his friends out of the club and my mouth was agape . I considered the idea that since they cant see , maybe they thought they gave me two twenties . But no . I have a blind friend who told me once that he folds each bill differently so he knows which denomination is which . I realized now that the way he said he was sorry for the tip was like " my friends are blind and have had a hard life and that 's all they can afford " kinda way . No . If they could afford a $32 cover charge and two beers each , they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the two bucks back with the old " you need this more than I do " but I decided to fuck that . I kept those two damn dollars . I just couldnt believe my eyes . After they left , I thought what a shame it was that we gave a booth that has a great view of the stage to three blind people . We shoulda put their asses at table 13 where all you can see is the back of the piano player . They would n't have cared anyway . The dog was sweet though . Guide dogs are always sweet . I wonder if he could see what a cheap owner he had . 109837 @qwx969837 
@@106055442 @1455442/ <h> Its Hot and Its Monotonous <p> Its hot outside . Really . Hot . Now I know some people live in Arizona or Texas where you can fry eggs on the sidewalk , but here in New York City it gets pretty toasty too . When the temperature hits the 90- mark something happens here . The heat bounces off the sidewalks and the skyscrapers and lands on the piles of garbage bags that are sitting on the sidewalk and then all that heat and funk gathers up into a big ball and rolls down the stairs into the subway platform and sits on the bench next you as you wait for the F train that may or may not be coming . And I am wearing black most of the time because that is my goddamn work uniform . <p> True , I could change into my uniform when I get to work but there are two issues with that . Number one , I do n't  ever want to leave home in time to get to work those three extra minutes it would take to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work there is always the chance that someone else will wear it when I 'm not there . Yeah , I do n't  get that either , but it happens . One time I was working with this girl who was wearing a uniform that was clearly too big . When I asked her what was up , she informed me that she forgot her clothes at home so she just put on someone elses . That is nasty . I do n't  wan na put on my pants and realize that the night before they were worn by someone who may have gotten her period in them . So I wear my blacks to work and deal with my face melting off . If it would just melt off in the right places , I would be fine with that . If some of my nose could melt away so its a normal size , praise to be to God . <p> When I got home last night and peeled my uniform off it sat on the floor and turned into a puddle of sweat . Why black ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice white linen or gauze outfit ? Or maybe a simple white t-shirt ? There was a time when the go-to restaurant uniform was khakis and a polo shirt , but over the ages it has evolved into all black . The best thing about the black is that it hides stains and wrinkles , but I 'd be willing to buy a bottle of bleach and an iron if it meant I could wear white for a change . I imagine that in ten years from now , restaurant owners will devise a new look for their servers to wear and it will be even more uncomfortable . Ca n't you just see us having to wear a burlap tuxedo as we take burger temperatures ? Its not that much of a stretch . When I was a cater waiter , I had to wear a tuxedo that was 110% polyester . Okay , it was only 100% polyester . The other 10% was embarrassment . And I never wore that to work . Even I was too ashamed to get on the train wearing a discounted used tuxedo that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Its about 90- today and in two hours I will be putting on my black shirt . I need some serious pit pads . And Arrid Extra Dry . And a towel . And a head band . The melting of the face will commence soon . Now if only I could figure out how to get my Dumbo ears to melt down to a regular size , I 'd be good . <p> And what do you wear to work ? ( And bonus points to anyone who gets the title reference . ) <p> I hear ya with the black in the summer . I too am forced to walk 3 blocks in the North Carolina heat ( 95+ from May to October ) from the parking garage to our restaurant , while wearing what amounts to a heavily starched ninja suit , which , by this time has become an extra layer of skin ! YUCK ! <p> I manage fine dining I am supposed to be in a jacket . And in the summertime I trade black slacks for black skirt . I just say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Janes . Still wear the Suit Jacket but it gets pretty skimpy underneath . = <p> um I am a manager at a restaurant that wears white button down shirts , and they all bitch that they want to wear black . Those girls ca n't iron or bleach to save their lives and the grass is always greenerI am glad I am the manager and can wear what I want ! <p> I 'm at a B&amp;N bookstore . Ride the bus , and then walk a quarter mile to the store . First half-hour at work the sweat is coloring my shirt , front and back . Not attractive . And I do n't have the facilities to keep clothes at the store.There just ai n't any good answer . <p> The worst for me was when I was in medical school and did a Burn Surgery rotation . I got to wear scrubs ( that was okay ) , but then I had to gown up in a thick , waterproof ( and bloodproof ) long-sleeved surgical gown , hat , mask , and long booties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under hot surgical spotlights in an 80-degree surgical suite ( has to be kept very warm for the patient ) , all the while smelling fresh and cooked blood and flesh . Just terrible . ( And obviously no picnic for the patients , either . ) . I 'm glad I 'm not a surgeon . <p> I run demos at Costco . Black nylon/cotton collared shirt , black polyester pants , black socks , Dansko black clogs . HOT , HOT , HOT . And not in a good way . I walk approximately 1/4 mile from the employee parking to the store . Yesterday it was 95 here in Boise . <p> Can I tell you what I wore to work for a year , the most hellish year of my life ? Okay I will . It was a black French maid costume , lowcut , with white lace around the neckline and panties with white ruffles on the behind , and a bow tied around the waist ! I would have loved to be swathed in black from head to toe . I refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I got the job , we wore jeans and any top we wanted . So , I did not willing sign up for this humiliation.Martin , carry your clothes in a small duffle bag , or at least carry the shirt to work . <p> I guess I 'm pretty lucky , we wear Billy Reid shirts with Khakis . I ca n't leave my uniform at work either but do n't look too terrible on the train , just a little country . When it gets too hot here the t-shirt changes to a tank and the shirts get washed after one wearing . If you have a massive spill you just have to put up with it . Plaid hides a lot though . <p> Ugh . I remember those NYC summer heat waves . I remember it being miserably hot like a dirty sauna . Just taking one subway ride to work , getting off and seeing dirt underneath my fingernails when the only thing I had touched was the subway pole . In Phoenix we get almost 3 months straight of 100+ . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no uniform . But generally I 'm in either a black skirt and top or a black dress with tights and flats . However , at my last waitressing job ( in a strip club ) we had to wear heels at least four inches high . They were 12 hour shifts with one break and we were n't allowed to sit down . <p> I also wear all black to my waitressing job polyester logo shirt and full length pants . While I am fortunate that I drive to work in an air-conditioned car , avoiding the " subway funk " , this does little to help the fact that the restaurant 's temperature is set to that which is comfortable only to little old ladies ( who I want to slap with my sweaty hand when they tell me how FREEEEZING it is in thereno it 's not , and it 's even hotter in the kitchen ! ) and that people constantly hold the door open as they enter , wait or leave . Also , my section is nearly always on the side of the restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of the building that catches the sun for my entire shift . Good post and that part about nasty people borrowing other 's uniforms is EXACTLY why I do n't leave my stuff therewell , that and it would surely be stolen , as they make us pay for our uniforms . <p> I used to work at the Cheesecake Factory .. where the uniform is white pants , white shirt , white belt . It might sound good in theory , but every little bit of anything that spills on you or brushes against you is visible , and we all looked/felt filthy all the time ! Also it was nearly impossible to get away with wearing the same shirt or pants for two shifts without washing them . <p> I am currently working at a McDonald 's in scorching hot Texas . Our uniforms are black pants , blue and black shirt , black apron , black socks . The weather is scorching hot , of course , but the grill I stand over every day is not much cooler . The first thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scrub like I 'm trying to eradicate the skin off my body . <p> Just discovered your blog after reading your Dr. Phil post , and you are fucking hilarious man ( despite the fact you looked a little bit like Carrot Top on TV . ) Anyway , if those restauranteurs you worked for , and the table-waiting fashion " experts " who came up with the brilliant idea of wearing black for professional purposes , were n't such dumbasses in Science class , they would KNOW that UV rays absorb black and make you hotter than you are . Lord knows if I were manager at a restaurant with an outdoor patio , especially when it gets to 100 degrees where you are , I would be cognizant ( sp ? ) of this and pick a ligther colour with a lighter , cooler fabric for my employees . Because everyone knows how unruly it is for customrs to see you perspire under your uniform . Very key.Whoever said black was the new " it " colour must 've either been drunk or living on Mars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral ( and even then , I 'd think that people should be wearing white if they 're having a gravesite service in 98 degree weather ) but to a restaurant waiter , it really should n't be necessary . Red , orange , yellow or green would be just as acceptable . These managers need to look into it . <p> Omg . Yes ! Even where I 've worked serving jobs where jeans are permitted , the shirt is black and thick . Where I work now , were not allowed to show a hint of a tattoo , so while I can wear black yogas and a tshirt , I have to make sure evenings covered , so its a tshirts and a tank top with the straps pulled completely tight to cover my chest . But then I cant let the band on my yogas show , so I have stolen a pregnancy band from my sister that hours around the waist , under the outer shirt and over the tank . -- 
@@106055444 @1455444/ <h> Monthly Archives : August 2012 <p> Things did not go well at work recently . Knowing that there are two sides to every story , I will explain the situation from two points of view . Yesterday , we saw it from the customers perspective ( click here to read ) and today we shall see it from my point of view . <p> HIS SIDE OF THE STORY <p> The club was crazy tonight . We had a 7:00 show of student performers who brought in an audience of people who did n't  know the first thing about seeing a cabaret show . We had reservations for 47 people so we only had two servers on the floor with no runner or busser , but then we had 35 walk-ins making it way too busy for just the two of us . And most of them ignored our request to get there at 6:30 so they would have time to get their drinks before the show starts . Everyone bum rushed the hostess stand at 6:55 meaning we were going to start the show late and everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their seat because it is first come first serve so all these losers who got there two minutes before show time had to take the tables that are off to the side . Not my fault . I was immediately in the weeds because everyone got there so late . None of them were used to being in a cabaret setting so I had to constantly explain that we have a two-drink minimum and they all seemed shocked at the prices . Its new York City cabaret , people Wake up and smell the show tunes . <p> We tried to start the show on time but it meant that I was taking orders and serving drinks in the dark . It was not pleasant . And customers looked all pissed off that we were starting the show even though they were the ones who got there late . I did n't  even have time to ring in my drinks so I was just calling them out to the bartender and he was making them as fast as he could . We really could have used a runner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been staffed accordingly . <p> I was so far behind and constantly apologizing to people for the delay . My tray always had at least eight or nine drinks on it and people were grabbing at me and yelling out orders as I walked by expecting that I would just remember every single thing they asked for even though they saw my hands were full and I could n't write anything down at that moment . <p> Table 36 yelled out to me that she wanted a cheese plate . I made a mental note to ring it in . They also wanted more drinks . While I was waiting for table 36s drinks , I continued to run drinks for the other 44 people I had in my station and every time I walked by 36 the lady gave me this look like " wheres my drink ? ? " I told her it would be right out and I was going as fast as I could . She got all pissed off and said " just bring me the drinks and the fucking cheese . " I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the lady parts but feared that my arm would be lost amongst the FUPA thus prohibiting me from doing my job for the remainder of the evening . <p> I finally got the cheese plate to her and went back to the bar pick up the drinks . When I put her vodka/cran/orange juice down , she totally flipped out because she could n't see any orange juice in it . I told her that I thought it did have orange juice or at least it should because it was just a reorder of the first drink which came out correctly . <p> " Well , I can see there ai n't  no orange juice in it ! " she said way too loudly considering there was someone on the stage about ten feet away from her singing a very sweet song . <p> It took everything I had to not raise my voice at her . I offered to put some more orange juice in it but she said there was n't any in there to begin with so how could I put in more ? Semantics , bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix it and went to the bar . <p> Well , guess who followed me . I could hear the " swish swish swish " of her thighs rubbing against her polyester pants . She came barreling at me yelling that I was disrespecting her and that I was rude . She told me that she works at Carolines Comedy Club and she knows what good service should be . All I was thinking was if she was a server , then she should be a little more understanding that I am in the weeds and in the scope of things , it was just a splash of fucking orange juice we were arguing about . <p> " I 'm 56 years old and you ca n't talk to me that way ! " she screeched . <p> " Well , I 'm 45 years old and here 's your drink , " I retorted . <p> I could tell that she was surprised at my age and that she thought I was probably about 27 . <p> She stormed off back to her seat with her drink in hand , the " swish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were people milling about the bar and one of the performers came up to me and said , " Just so you know , that is not my friend . " The hostess walked over to me and informed me that the lady was just as rude to her when she first arrived . <p> I immediately voided the drinks from her check because I knew that she had waited longer than she should have for them and I did , in fact , screw up the second one . I wanted to make amends . I can admit when I make a mistake , which is something she apparently can not do based on her haircut/wig and makeup choice . <p> When I gave her the check and tried to apologize she totally ignored me . " Sorry about the misunderstanding . I took your drinks off the check . " Nothing from her except a turned head . What a bitch . " So , I took your drinks off your check , " I repeated . She turned her head away from me even further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell the back of her own neck . " Okay .. " I sighed . <p> She left right away , but I could tell that the two friends she was with were embarrassed for her behavior because they stuck around for a few minutes as if to distance themselves from the " crazy lady who made the scene during the poignant moment of the show . " They paid the check and left me a decent tip which I am sure was a pity one . As for their friend , shell probably threaten to never come back but in reality she probably only came in the first place because her friends were paying for it . <p> Things did not go well at work last night . At all . Knowing that there are two sides to every story , I will explain the situation from two points of view . Today , we shall see it from the customers perspective and the next blog post will be from- mine . <p> HER SIDE OF THE STORY <p> So I went to this club last night to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never heard of the place and its not usually my thing but I figured since I had the night off and they said they would pay for it , why not ? The show was at 7:00 and we got there right on time at about 6:59 . The hostess was a total bitch because she asked me if I had a reservation . I just shot her one of my " bitch who you think you talkin to " looks and kept on walking . And then she was all , " Oh are you with the two guys I just checked in ? " and I gave her my world famous " bitch I done ignored you once " look and strutted my ass in to my seat . <p> It was so crowded and they gave us the shittiest table in the whole place . I do n't  know how people got those good seats close to the stage . They musta got there crazy early like at 6:45 or something . Anyway , when the waiter finally made it to our table , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice and I must say he had some fabu hair . He could n't have been a day over 27 years old . My friends ordered gin and tonics and I wanted me a vodka with cranberry and orange . <p> " How much is that gon na cost ? " I asked the waiter and he was all , " I 'm not sure but I think its about $11.00 . " Dayum , these people are proud of their drinks , right ? <p> About thirty minutes later , he brought the drinks to us . The show had already started by then . I do n't  know why they did n't  wait until everyone had their drinks first . They acted like the show was scheduled to start at 7:00 or something . <p> About ten minutes later , I saw our waiter walking by not doing shit so I told him I wanted a cheese plate . He did n't  write it down and I knew he was gon na forget it . A bit later , he was walking by again and he did n't  have my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tells me hell be right out with it . The next time he walks by , he is carrying a tray with about ten drinks and are any of them mine ? Hell , no . What the hell is he doing ? <p> " Wheres my drink ? Wheres my cheese ? " I said . <p> And he s all , " I 'm sorry , but you 'll get it when you get it " and I 'm all " just bring me the drinks " and he s all " I put the order in " and I 'm all " so where is it then " and he s all " I 'll go check " and I 'm all " just bring the drinks and the fucking cheese " and he s all " okay . " <p> When he came back in , he had the cheese plate and then he left to go get the drinks . He finally put my drink down and I see that there ai n't  a drop of orange juice in it . <p> " Umm , wheres my orange juice ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all bitchy with me and says there is orange juice in it and I can see with my own two eyes that there ai n't  any orange juice in it and he tells me he will go put some more in it and I tell him he cant put more in it if there was n't any in there to begin with . He grabbed my glass and goes to to the bar . Well , honey , I followed his ( cute little ) ass right to the bar cause I wanted to have some words with him . <p> " Excuse me , " I say to him . " You do not talk to me that way . I work at Carolines Comedy Club and I know how to treat a customer . You are rude ! " <p> And all he has to say to me is " Heres your drink . It has orange juice in it now . " <p> " You were rude to me ! " <p> " Heres your drink . Do you still want it ? Here it is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  talk to me that way ! " <p> And he tells me " Well , I 'm 45 years old and here is your drink with orange juice in it . " <p> And I tells him , " You need to act your age then ! " but really all I was thinking about was how good he looks for being 45 . I could see some other people milling about the bar and I could tell they were totally on my side . I took my drink back to my seat . What a bitchy waiter . <p> After the show , he puts down our check and then he s all trying to be nice by apologizing and saying he took both my drinks off the check for the misunderstanding . I ignored him when he said it because I wanted to show him who was the boss . He said it again and I turned my head away from him so hed know for sure that I was ignoring him . Bitchy waiter . <p> My two friends seemed like they wanted to hang out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the check . I walked out and did n't  say thank you for the comped drinks because I wanted that waiter to know I was mad . That bitch of a hostess told me to have a nice night but I ignored her ass too . <p> I wait tables and I know how to treat a customer . So what if he was busy ? He needs to learn to respect me . It do n't  matter that I am in the same industry . I do n't  care that his ( cute little ) ass got in the weeds . That ai n't  my problem . I will never go there again . <p> Tune in to the next blog post to see The Bitchy Waiters side of the story . <p> Once upon a time , a long long time ago , I wrote a blog post about a woman who does not tip . After stiffing her server several different times , the restaurant refused to serve her anymore and then the lady got her panties and wig all in a twist and it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someone posted a comment on it and I must respond because what she wrote was so very special . Her comments are in bold : <p> Instead of expecting a customer to pay you for your " hardwork " you should complain to your boss or the owner of the establishment ! ! What urks me is that you feel entitled to receive a tip instead of a pay check . <p> What should I be telling my boss ? That I want $24 an hour so that tips are no longer needed ? I 'm sure he will jump right on that . I do n't  feel entitled to to receive a tip instead of a pay check . I do n't  get a paycheck , bitch . Okay , I do get one , but its usually for $12 , so yes , the tip is important . <p> You know there are all types of Jobs out there that should be entitled to tips but they never get one . <p> Since you capitalized " Jobs , " I assume you are referring to the Biblical figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing his wealth , his children and his health all because God wanted to prove to Satan that Job would continue to serve his Lord , but I do n't  think Job served God in the way that waiters do , like with a tray and taking drink orders . Maybe Job deserved a tip for keeping his faith in God despite the many hardships that fell his way but I think you 're getting your Bible stories mixed up , lady . <p> For instance a teacher will teach a child all day for over 250 days a year . They receive pay for just the amount of days they teach and then that pay is divided by 12 and then taxes , insurance , and a few other fees are taken out . When the teacher receives their pay it equals about half of their gross pay . And then if they are a high school teacher they have to take that pay and buy things for their classroom and supply a lot of different things to make it easier and more enjoyable for the child to learn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if they are a coach they get paid around 125.00 a month to work 35 to 40 extra hours a week which.comes out to less than a dollar an hour . Do they receive tips ? No and they serve the public way more than a waiter or waitress . Do they complain ? No ! ! ! <p> I do n't  really get this argument . Teachers do complain . A lot . I am friends with teachers . I have been a teacher . Everyone complains about their job . One teacher got suspended for complaining on her blog so your argument that teachers do n't  ever complain is out the window . Next ? <p> There are so many jobs out there that deserve tips but it is in thought of to give this person a tip . I am not a teacher . I actually have a job where I " serve " the public every day and I.do not get tips . <p> This sentence is of the kind that makes , Ithard to know what talking about you . Are . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to your pimp about that not tips getting . <p> If you are so worried about your pay then get a different job or go to your employer and ask for more pay or get the laws changed so they have to pay you min . Wage . <p> Note to self : Tomorrow after work , get the laws changed . Should be easy . <p> I have been reading your blog out of complete boredom while I get over a surgery . <p> Good luck with the lap band . <p> You are the whinest , spoiled , over payer , jerk I have ever seen . I know I have never been a customer in any of the places you have worked . But if I was I would leave , ask for another waiter , or turn you into the board of health . In fact I do believe that every place you have worked or do work at should be deeply looked into by the board of health . <p> I do n't  know what an " over payer " is but thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my station before . How would you even know ? Feel free to turn me " into " the board of health . ( Is that like turning a frog into a prince ? ) They love when people " turn someone in " for blogging . Blogging has such an impact on the cleanliness of the kitchen and you would truly be doing them a service . <p> I do hope that you get fired , and that you are black listed at all future job openings and that you have to work at a " real " job and you get paid only what you deserve . <p> Fired ? From your lips to Gods ears , but hopefully , I wo n't ever end up on the Restaurant Black List that is circulated amongst restaurant managers throughout the country because there is totally a Restaurant Black List that is circulated amongst restaurant managers throughout the country . Yeah . Uh huh . <p> I also hope someone takes ajax and washes your moth out and that God punishes you for the way you talk about children ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moth with Ajax . Moths are very delicate creatures and do not deserve to be washed with harsh chemicals like Ajax . You are a horrible person to even suggest such a thing and I should turn you in to PETA for even threatening such action . Moths are Gods creatures ! If God wants to punish me for the way I talk about children , I will look to Job for inspiration . But really , even God has got to know that sometimes kids are a big fat pain in the ass . <p> Grow up get a real job and quit complaining about your current or past jobs you big spoiled jack a** .. <p> I will quit complaining when there is nothing left to complain about , you big spoiled cu** .. ( cunt face . ) <p> Thank you for the comment . I really do read every single comment that is posted on the blog and it means a lot to me that people even bother to write anything at all . This particular comment was an extra special helping of crazy though and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did Not Show Up:There is a reason we do not take reservations at my restaurant . You are it . You see , we are a really small restaurant- with only about 16 tables . Remember last week when you called and said you wanted a reservation but we said that we do n't  take them but you begged us and so we did ? We should not have done that.You called on Wednesday night and said there were going to be about eight or nine of you coming to dinner the following night and could we please please- please reserve a table because you are you are so totally coming to celebrate your birthday and you do n't  want to have to wait when you get there . Against our better judgement , we did it . Thursday rolls around and I am at work . You told us you would be there at 7:30 and that you would call at 6:45 to confirm . You did not call . At the busiest time of the night , I stopped seating five two-tops . Four would have been better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had to save a whole extra table . Do you know how many people I was unable to sit because of your reservation ? A lot . " But it will all be worth it , " - I thought . " When the nine-top gets here and everyone has apps and cocktails and desserts and then I get to add a 20% gratuity to the check , it will all be worth it. ! " I was giddy with anticipation . 7:00 : You did not call to confirm yet , but you must be busy getting ready for your big dinner out.7:15 : " No , I 'm sorry , maam , that table is reserved , you 'll have to sit at the crappy table next to the bathroom . No , we do n't  usually take reservations , but we made an exception tonight . " <p> 7:16 : Every table is full now except for the five two-tops I pushed together . I hope no one else comes in right now . <p> 7:17 : - " Hello , sir . No , I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now , sir . That is reserved . Oh , so you 'll go next door to eat ? Okay good bye . I 'm sorry . " 7:19 : " Hi there . Table for three ? There will be about a 15 minute wait . Yes , all those tables are reserved . Oh , you 'll come back later ? Okay , thank you . " They did not come back.7:25 : Almost here ! 7:32 : Running a bit late , I suppose . No big deal.7:40 : Ummm , where are you ? 7:50 : Okay , I 'm getting pissed off.8:00 : You suck . Where the fuck are you ? 8:01 : I am breaking the tables apart and seating them meaning that now I am going to get slammed by having five empty tables all become available at the same time . I hate you . Why did you make me keep those tables open for you if you knew you were not coming ? Did you lose your cell phone up your own asshole which made it impossible for you to call and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went out of our way to give you a reservation and this is what happens ? Never again will we " make an exception " because too many times it is not worth it to do so . Our place is small enough that we do n't  need to take reservations . We can fill up just by walk-ins . I hope that the birthday celebration sucked . I hope that when they brought out the cake with candles on it , you bent over to blow them out and your eyebrows were singed off . I hope the cake was as dry as Phylis Dillerss vag . I hope every gift you got was the wrong size and wrong color and that you got no gift receipts . I hope that it was the shittiest birthday you have ever had because you ruined a good portion of my shift . My station sat empty for over an hour and I made no money . I hate you.So the next time you want to make a reservation at my restaurant and you say " Pretty please with sugar on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a resounding NO . No . No . No . We do not take reservations.Love , The Bitchy Waiter <p> p.s . You 're lucky that the person who took your reservation did not take your phone number or there would now be a flyer hanging at Queens College that says you are selling an iPad for $150 and to only call after 11:00 PM . <p> This- is the story of a very important man . He may even be the most important man in the world . His name is not Barack Obama or Donald Trump or even Jose Cuervo . His name is something that I was not privy too , because he was far too important to share such information with little ol lowly me . After all , I was just his waiter . This man was so important that when he walked into the restaurant with his girlfriend he did not feel the need to acknowledge my presence in any way . <p> " Hello , sir . Table for two ? " He walked past me . I followed . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the back of the restaurant . <p> " Would you like menus ? Are there just going to be two of you ? " He headed to the door that leads to the patio , still not hearing me . <p> Finally , " Hey can we sit on the patio ? " <p> " Yes , sir . Absolutely . Wherever you like . " <p> He and his girlfriend plopped themselves down at the one table that is not a two-top because he s so important that he needs extra space for his huge fat ego . I handed them menus . <p> " Bring me a glass of Chardonnay while she 's deciding what she wants to drink . " <p> When I returned with his wine , she was ready for he drink . Or rather , she was ready- to ask me what- I thought she would like to drink . Judging by her decision to spend her evening with the douche bag across the table from her , - I ventured she would like the Old Fashion seeing that it , much like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of crap . " Oh that sounds good but maybe I 'll have the Blueberry Vodka lemonade . " <p> The Very Important Man pointed at his almost empty wine glass and then raised his index and second fingers to indicate he is ready for glass number two . That must be " May- I please have another glass of chardonnay " in Very Important Man speak . I obliged . <p> Three minutes later , when I brought their drinks , I saw the man had put on his Bluetooth and was now talking on the phone as was his girlfriend . To me , it sounded like it was a bunch of mumbo jumbo and I did not pay it much attention . What did catch my eye , however , was the fact that in addition to the Bluetooth , he also had a cell phone on the table . Oh did I say a cell phone ? I meant cell phones , as in six of them . Yes , this man had six cell phones spread out across the table along wit a key chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was the most important man in the world . What other reason could he possibly have for having six cell phones unless he was in the process of making very important decisions like solving world hunger , accepting the vice-presidential nomination and settling the dispute between several Middle Eastern countries ? It just happened that the only conversation I heard was about where he had parked his car . Very important , indeed . <p> A while into their meal , the Very Important Man got up to go to the bathroom to make , what I assume to be , a very important dump . " What 's with all the cell phones , " I asked his girlfriend . <p> She rolled her eyes . " It makes him feel important . Or at least he thinks it makes him look important . " <p> " Oh , its working , " I confirmed . <p> " Uh huh , right , " she said with lips pursed and eyebrows raised . <p> Throughout their meal , the man kept checking his various phones for messages . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked his Facebook once or twice . He ordered a total of six glasses- of wine . Seeing that he weighed about 340 pounds , it did n't  seem to make any difference in his behavior so I did n't  worry about it . I figured most of the wine was- soaked up by his importance.Their bill was $146 and V.I.P. left me a twenty dollar tip . Whatever . Thirty would have been nice but I got something much more important . He taught me a lesson that day that I will carry with me for the rest of my life . And now I can pass it on to you : <p> The moral of this story : " The men who carry cell phones , six , are probably compensating for very small dicks. " 109838 @qwx969838 <p> We live in a world that is connected by a series of social media applications that were originally intended to bring us closer together but what they have actually done is give people a false sense of relationship . Just because you know that your best friend from high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not necessarily mean that you are still friends . So many of us , myself definitely included , depend on Facebook , Instagram , Twitter , Foursquare , Yelp , etc. to alert the world to our personal goings on and opinions . Maybe it makes us feel like we are surrounded by people who care or it gives us a sense of importance to know that ( insert number of Facebook friends here ) people may be reading about our thoughts on the Olympics . ( " Cried happy tears for the womens gymnastics . I love that emotion of working your butt off and having it pay off ! " said Amy S. ) The one social media application that probably most affects our lives as restaurant folk ( were sorta like carney folk , except we smell like honey mustard and fajitas instead of cotton candy and the stench of " what the fuck life choice did I make that made be a carney folk . " ) is Yelp . <p> Yelp started out as a great idea . " Hey , let 's start a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into " Hey , I had one bad experience at a restaurant so I am going to go online and trash the hell out of them . " Countless times , I have walked up to tables who are snapping cell phone pictures of their food and sending it off to Yelp before they have even had their second bite . Yelp let 's every Tom , Dick and Asshole become the restaurant critic they always wanted to be without all the , you know , qualifications . <p> Regularly , I go to to Yelp to read the reviews of my restaurant to see if anyone is complaining about me . The last time I was mentioned specifically , they had this to say : " Special shout-out to my waiter The Bitchy Waiter , who was very attentive and offered wonderful food suggestions in the neighborhood . " Hmm , they liked me ; must have been an off night for me . However , so many reviews are filled with the most idiotic comments that you wonder how the writer even figured out how to turn on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Case in point : a review I read for Dog and Duck , a local neighborhood restaurant . A person named Sen-Pei wrote , " When I came here once with a friend , mosquitoes bit up my legs and thighs . I have to say that this does happen a lot in general ( my legs and thighs are some tender sweet things ; -P ) , but this was unbearable . Do something about that . " <p> Why would anyone give a negative review to a restaurant based on something that the restaurant has no control over ? Do people just look for something to bitch about ? ( " Bitchy Waiter , you 're the biggest bitch I know , " said everyone who is reading this . ) Okay , Sen-Pei , I am going to " do something about that . " Mosquitoes are so annoying and even though I do n't  work at Dog and Duck , I do have the direct line to Mother nature and I am going to give her a call just for you . And yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : <p> youtube LONG ... next time you go to Yelp to review something , please remember to give critique and opinion and not just complain.If you have a complaint that was specific to you , make sure it will benefit others if they read it . " The baby at the booth next to me was so freaking loud " or " it rained on me while i tried to eat on the patio " is not going to help anyone decide whether or not they want to eat there . " The lights are too dim " or " it seemed like the air conditioning was broken " is better . " The Bitchy Waiter was wonderful " is the best . 
@@106055446 @1455446/ <h> Yearly Archives : 2013 <p> The first day of spring was a few weeks ago which means one thing for restaurant workers : its patio season ! Its that time of year when dining al fresco is the most important thing a restaurant patron can possibly do with their day . It can mean extra tips for servers but along with those tips comes extra work . Setting up and breaking down a patio can be a miserable experience . How many of us have had to do it more than once during a shift when the rains starts and then stops and then starts again ? In order to assist our customers , for its all about their needs , I have created a list of rules for dining on the patio . <p> Do n't  complain about the weather . You wanted to sit outside so if its windy or too hot please do n't  expect your server do something about it . Most servers do not have Mother Nature or God on speed dial so they are unable to help with the climate . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'd rather use that connection for our own personal needs like asking Mother Nature to make it rain when its our turn to set up the patio or having God give flat tires to people who leave 5% tips . <p> Do n't  come into the restaurant and then ask the hostess what its like on the patio . If it was 98- when you got out of your car and rolled your bucket of Ranch dressing ass up to the host stand , there is a pretty good chance its also 98- on the patio . And while were at it , do n't  ask if its going to cool down or if its going to stop raining soon . Do we look like Sam Champion or Al Roker ? If we could predict the future we would not be waiting tables . Wed be on the 5:00 news prognosticating the weather or in Atlantic City playing craps . <p> Please be aware that the floor may be uneven . The patio is not necessarily a smooth even floor that will let your table be perfectly steady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cement , wood , grass or if you 're in New York City , it will be the Ninth Avenue sidewalk . This could affect the stability of your table . If you need a solid surface for your table to be on , might I suggest sitting inside where an architect made sure that the floors were level as opposed to sitting outside where a restaurant owner threw a card table onto a piece of plywood and called it a patio ? <p> Do n't  freak the fuck out if a bug or a leaf lands in your food . You 're outside and this is one of the inherent risks that you took when deciding to leave the safety of four walls and a roof . No restaurant is going to comp your meal because a leaf fell into your mimosa and no restaurant is going to comp your meal because a lady bug took a nap in your salad . You deal with it . Pretend you 're camping , pick up the offending object and throw it away . <p> If you live in New York City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , but its still a place where people are working and eating and you are not allowed to smoke . If you need that cigarette all you have to do is stand up and walk outside the perimeter of the dining area and light it up . And if you are in a city that allows you to smoke , do n't  use your plate as a fucking ashtray . <p> Forgive your server for being sweaty . As you sit underneath your patio umbrella sipping frozen daiquiris and iced teas , your server is walking back and forth from table to table under the blaring sun . He might be a Sweaty Betty . He hates having the pit stains even more than you hate looking at them . Ignore them . Do n't  tell your server things like , " You sure look like you 're working hard " or " Hot enough for you ? " He is working hard and it is hot enough for him . Drink your drink and shut up . <p> Have patience . Often times , the patio is as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for more dressing the server is going to have to weave through the patio , go up the three steps to the restaurant , go inside , cross the entire dining room and then enter the kitchen to get that dressing . It will take a couple more minutes than it would if you were sitting inside . Consequently , do your server and yourself a favor by consolidating your requests . Or better yet question yourself this : " Do I really need that extra mayo ? " <p> Dress appropriately . You may be outside , but you 're still in a public place . Shoes and shirts are required . I know you may want to get some sun , sir , but no one wants to eat their Awesome Blossom while looking at your sagging man titties covered in grey fur resting themselves on your table . It may seem like a good idea to take your feet out of your shoes so they can feel the cool grass but please keep those unpedicured horrors covered up or at least in a flip flop . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may have stopped raining a whole five minutes ago , but that does not mean the patio is open for business . Its wet and none of the tables are set up . Do n't  ask if we can " just go dry one off " for you . We are not going to open the patio until we know it is going to stay open . Nothing is worse than seating a patio and then having a rain storm blow in and suddenly there are fifteen tables of customers who need to move inside all at once . If its closed , its closed for a reason . <p> Make sure you hand payment to the server . Do n't  just place a stack of cash on the table and walk away . The same goes for a credit card slip . That cool breeze you were enjoying ten minutes earlier can also be the thing that blows your payment into the parking lot . No server wants to go chasing after a credit card voucher as it whips around tables and trees . Take an extra minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hopefully these handy dandy tips will make dining on a patio a better experience for all involved . We servers look forward to having you sit in our sections on the patio but we also would request that you keep these things in mind . One final thought : the patio is not your own personal backyard and there are other people waiting to sit at that table when you are finished eating . Please enjoy your time there . Enjoy the view of the lake or the parking lot or Second Avenue but know that if you stay there too long after you have finished eating , your server may begin to resent you . We make our money by turning tables over and re-seating them . If you 're desperate to sit outside for an unlimited amount of time , take your ass to the park . <p> We lost a cultural icon this weekend when Jean Stapleton died in her New York City home at the age of 90 . How does this have anything to do with The Bitchy Waiter ? Hold on , give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Okay , got it . She made her Broadway debut in 1953 playing a wise-cracking waitress in a play called In the Summer House . Seeing that she played a waitress at least once in her illustrious career gives me full license to write about her on a blog called The Bitchy Waiter , right ? <p> Jean Stapleton had an amazing career but the world knows her best as Edith Bunker from All in the Familywhich ran on CBS from 1971 to 1979 . When she died on Saturday , so many of us who are of a certain age were saddened by the news . I was told at work by someone who must have been wrongfully checking their Facebook while on the clock . " Hey , Jean Stapleton died , " he said as casually as telling me that Table 7 needed another refill . My heart broke a little bit , but why ? I never knew Jean Stapleton but it did n't  stop my eyes from filling with tears . I quickly brushed them away so no one would see me crying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  even know . It was n't the first time I had hidden tears that came because of Jean Stapleton . <p> On March 19th , 1978 , I remember watching the episode of All in the Family that had Mike and Gloria moving to California and saying good bye to Archie and Edith . As they all stood in the doorway trying to find the words to say goodbye , I held back my tears so that my parents would n't think that they had a sissy for a son . Gloria and Mike finally left and we heard the sound effect of their cab driving them to the airport . I watched as Archie and Edith faced their new existence . Edith saw Archie crying but did n't  want him to know that she knows he s a big old softie. - She brought him his familiar can of beer but they were lost . Unsure how to handle the deafening silence in the house , they sat on their chairs , alone together . The camera pulled back revealing just how alone they were in the big empty house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; just the two of them sitting there with unbearable looks of sadness on their faces . The screen faded to black in silence . This was when I politely excused myself from the living room . <p> " I 'm gon na go get some water , " I announced to my family as I headed towards the kitchen . Once I was safely away from the judging eyes of my brothers , I let the tears flow . I stood there in front of our Harvest Gold refrigerator and cried , so sad for Edith and Archie Bunker . Silly of me to think that my parents did n't  know their eleven-year old child was crying in the kitchen over a TV show , but just like Edith did for Archie , they pretended not to notice . <p> I know a lot of people who are sad that Jean Stapleton is gone . We all felt like we knew her . Maybe its because she was such a fixture on our television screens for so long but more than likely , it is because everyone has someone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be an aunt or sister or your mom who has that same attitude that Edith had . She loved her family despite their flaws . She rarely had an unkind word for anyone and when she did it was hard for her to admit . She was lovable and could tolerate anything . In my family , it was my grandma who we all thought reminded us of Edith . Maybe it was little bit because of her physical appearance but it was also the way that she sometimes could be forgetful or easily confused but always happy . When Jean Stapleton died , everyone who grew up watching All in the Family lost something too . We cant help but think back to when we were thirty years younger and , depending on our age , either living with our parents or living with our children . For me , it reminds me of a time when my world revolved around my family ; my Mom and Dad and two brothers . I was a kid watching television with his family , albeit really mature television . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but thinking back on it now , was it ever better than sitting on the couch with my whole family watching TV ? Jean Stapleton does n't  just make us think of All in the Family , she makes us think about our own families . <p> So , no this post has nothing to do with waiting tables , other than the fact that we know Jean Stapleton played a waitress on Broadway once . But this post does have to do with the daily goings on of a waiter who is sometimes bitchy and sometimes bitter but is today very very sentimental . Rest in peace , Jean Stapleton . The world will miss you . <p> " Excuse me , young man , " asks an elderly gentleman . " But do you have a hat check ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , what ? " I say . <p> " A hat check . Is there a girl I can leave my hat with ? " <p> " Ummm , no sir I 'm sorry but there is n't . " <p> Elaine Stritchs voice scratches through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last fifty years . A hat check ? A fucking hat check ? Is is he next going to ask me where the nearest Automat can be found ? The median age of the shows audience tonight is somewhere between 85 and death . The performer is celebrating his 80th birthday by putting on a show so naturally , most of his audience has their platinum AARP cards and Life Alert bracelets . <p> " Ah , well , I guess I will just have to hold it then ' " says the old man as he shuffles back to his seat . <p> As I watch him walk away , it looks like he is clutching his hat as tightly as he is clenching his butt cheeks and I wonder how many spoonfuls of Metamucil he has had so far today . He sits down and looks around the room as if awaiting a cigarette girl to walk by and sell him a pack of Lucky Strikes that he can take with him to the USO show later on tonight . <p> " Cheese and crackers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe this place does n't  have a hat check ? What is this world coming to ? " <p> " I hear ya , buddy , " says the other old man . " Why just yesterday , I was looking for a shoe shine boy and I could n't find one anywhere . Its disgraceful . I had to do it myself . " <p> " By the way , I noticed your shoes tonight were looking quite nice . Is that a new pair of spats ? " <p> " Thank you for noticing . They are new spats . Are n't  they dandy ? I found them in my basement last night when I was looking for a new tube for my radio . It blew out last night when I was listening to a broadcast of The Baby Snooks Show . " <p> The two old men seem happy in their world of of yesteryear . As the hostess walks by , I watch them give her the once over . <p> " Get a load of them gams , will ya ? Shes one hot tomato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " <p> I approach the table . " Hello , gentleman . Can I get you anything to drink tonight ? " <p> One man orders an Old Fashioned and the other wants a martini with gin . Sadly , we are all out of our house made bathtub gin and I ring in Bulldog instead . When I place the drinks down I ask if they need anything else . <p> They both begin laughing . " That Cole Porter is a genius , I tell ya , a genius . " They continue chuckling . <p> " Okay , " I say . " Enjoy the show . " <p> " Oh you bet we will . Its gon na be a real ring-a-ding-ding . But can we get a couple of city juices ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , what ? " <p> " A city juice . Ya know , dog soup ? A glass of water ? " <p> " Sure , I 'll be right back . " <p> I return with their waters and step away from the time warp they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the show , I give them their check . <p> " How much do we owe ya , sport ? " one asks me . <p> " Its $78.72 . " <p> He throws a roll of money onto the table . " Theres ten sawbucks , buddy . The rest of the cabbage is yours . We got ta 23-skidoo outta here cause this one here is dizzy with a dame and were gon na go try to find her at the Automat . " <p> They place their hats on their heads and make their way out of the room . <p> " Thank you . Have a good night , " I say as they walk towards the exit . <p> " Our pleasure , kiddo . " <p> And with that , they are gone . They vanish into the night and fade away into memories of speakeasies , coppers , flappers and places where a hat check girl with amazing gams is happy to sell you a pack of Lucky Strikes . <p> Yes , a man really did ask me if we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . <p> On this day many decades ago , a very pregnant woman went into a restaurant . Although her delivery date was only days away , the the temptation for one last meal out before being tied down to a bundle of joy for the next eighteen years was too much and she decided to take herself out to dinner . She sat in a booth and asked for an iced tea . As the waitress set the tall glass of tea on the table , the woman noticed that there was no lemon wedge . " What kind of waitress does n't  serve a lemon with an iced tea ? " she thought . At that precise moment , she felt a kick in her stomach . It was n't a simple twisting of her baby . It was more direct as if the baby needed out right that second . Another kick and this time it was enough to make the woman double over . <p> " Are you ready to order , maam ? " asked the waitress . <p> The woman grabbed the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laminate tabletop that was sticky with syrup . " I think I 'm having my baby right now , " she moaned . <p> " Oh , okay . I 'm gon na give you some more time then , " the waitress said as she turned away and left . <p> With a force of nature never before seen , the baby began forcing its way out of the birth canal . The mother , worried and alone , did n't  know what else to do but let things happen . She leaned back in the booth and two minutes later she was looking at her newborn baby . With curly blond hair , hazel eyes , a devious smile and a black apron covering his privates , the baby looked up at his mother . With his tiny little hands , he pointed at the iced tea . His face scrunched up in a look of confusion and his lips moved into a pout as he began making noises with his new found vocal chords .. <p> " Hello , little baby . Are you about to cry ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He again pointed at the glass of tea , now sweating with condensation . " Tell that bitch to bring you a lemon wedge for the iced tea ! " he wailed . <p> The mothers heart melted at hearing his first words . " Oh my precious little boy . I shall name you Bitchy . Bitchy Waiter . " <p> So , yes its my birthday but its not the only important thing that happened on May 29th : of the time . " What most people do not know is the second part of this sentence which is , " However , the three-second rule is a real thing and in some instances you can institute the ten-second rule and in very rare cases you can use the 30-minute rule , because some people are fools all the time and deserve to eat some dirty fucking bread sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Womens Rights Convention . 140 years later an unemployed actor who was waiting tables at Black Eyed Pea in Houston , Texas took the day off from work to portray her as a walking puppet for some stupid ass historical society bullshit , but he got paid $75 bucks so he was cool with it . <p> 1943- Meat &amp; cheese was rationed in the United States which made it very hard on waiters and waitress across he country .

Kennedy , LaToya Jackson , Annette Benning , Melissa Etheridge , Beatrice Lillie and the angel known as Lisa Welchel . Happy birthday to all of us ! <p> I always arrive to work knowing there is a shift meal waiting for me . Most of the time , I eat before I get there in case the meal is something that I would rather not ingest . I have learned that Juan takes it very personally if anyone eschews the meal he hasprepared for us and its easier to simply take it whether I plan on eating it our not . With trepidation , I look over to the kitchen to see what combination of leftover slop and about-to-turn foods will be thrown together and presented on a plate as our family meal . Sitting on a plate behind the line is the most awful shift meal I have ever seen . I do n't  typically like my food to have the ability to look back at me , but this one was n't only staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate of pasta or even a whole fish . Todays shift meal is a pig head , complete with snout . <p> " Mucho bueno , para familia , huh ? " says Juan . <p> " What the fuck ? Is that a joke ? " <p> Juan puts his hands on the mouth of the pig and moves the dried crispy lips . " I 'm very good . Yummy . " He laughs at his own joke as the nose of the pig falls off the face and onto the cutting board . Juan quickly replaces the snout and continues on with his sick ventriloquism act . " Ouch , my nose hurts . " He laughs at his own joke as he pets the pigs head as if it were a kitten . " Good , no ? " <p> " No . I think I 'll pass today , thanks . Ill swing over to the deli and get a Cliff Bar or a banana or maybe I 'll just eat a roll of paper towels because I am not eating a pig head . Where did that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimes in the manager . " I bought it for us today . " He says this with pride as if he is presenting us with free iPads , blank checks and chocolate . <p> I realize that this pigs face was once attached to bacon which is quite tasty when mixed into an omelet if you can forget that the egg came from the ass of a chicken that is crammed into a coop with 11 other hens who are wallowing about in their own feces . I like ham sandwiches and pork chops but I do not like seeing the teeth and whiskers of the animal from which it came . I am a carnivore , but I am one of the millions of people who like to pretend that my meat comes from an animal called a hamburger and that chicken fingers grow on trees like plums . It is not rational for me to think this way but this is why I will not eat any meat with bones in it or the the dark meat or skin of a bird . Any reminder that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a pet must be erased before I can enjoy eating it . How can I be expected to take pleasure in veal parmigiana if I allow myself to imagine what that young calf was like as it was force fed whole milk and heavy cream while lying in a cage ? Just put some extra sauce and cheese on it and cut the bone out for me , please . <p> A few minutes later , Juan confirms with me that I will not be participating in the family meal . <p> " No , I do n't  want to be a part of this family . Consider me an orphan today . I 'd rather eat gruel . " <p> He begins to plate the food for the others who are looking forward to having a face to face conversation with their lunch . I watch as he slices the forehead into thin slabs of " I cant eat that shit . " I hear that someone wants to eat the cheeks and that the tongue tastes like bacon and I cant tell if they are being funny or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwich . The forehead is served with cous cous and salad and its the first time I have ever seen cous cous be the most appetizing item on a plate of food . <p> Once the head has been picked clean , it goes into the trash can . Juan places it in the garbage carefully and with great deliberation . Its as if he is showing respect for this pig that has fed him so well but he informs me that he wants it facing up so that when the late shift gets in it will freak them out when they throw something away . " Adios , piggy piggy , " he says as he walks away from the garbage can . I walk over and look into the can . The pig is staring right at me and I am surprised that the eyeballs are still there . Did n't  someone want to freeze them and have them later as garnish for a bacon infused martini ? I take some paper towel and cover up the head , partly out of respect but mostly because I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over every time I throw away a napkin . <p> I relish my peanut butter Cliff Bar and begin my shift . But I ca n't help but wonder what this Cliff Bar would taste like with bacon bits in it . <p> Thursdays were always a good day for me at the restaurant because of who I worked with on that shift . Brendan and I had been shift partners for over a year and a half . For a long time , he was the bartender and I was the only server and that was it . No busser , no runner and no other servers . We pooled the tips and at the end of the night , we split them down the middle . We had a routine , Brendan and I did . We knew how to work together and we liked each other . We shared stories about our lives that had nothing to do with work . We both heard about the others wedding and we knew about each others families . That all changed last Thursday when I got to work and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nooooooo ! " I silently screamed . " Noooo ! ! ! ! What happened ? ? " <p> Minutes later another bartender showed up and started doing sidework . I knew this bartender but had n't  seen him in months . " Hey , I thought you did n't  work here anymore , " I said . " What happened to Brendan ? " <p> " I du n no . I was told he does n't  work here anymore and now I 'm back . Would you get me some lemons when you go downstairs ? " <p> I had always gotten the lemons for Brendan but Brendan never had to ask me to do it . I just did it . As I stood in the walk-in , I pulled out my cell phone and sent Brendan a Facebook message . <p> " Where are you ? What the hell ? " <p> He responded almost immediately . " Yeah , I was going to tell you . I quit . " <p> I was stunned . Brendan explained to me what went down but I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this post . Let 's just say that someone was unhappy with his performance and rather than asking him to change , they thought it would be- easier to cut his shifts from four to one so he would just quit . The restaurant business can be cut-throat . The point is that Brendan no longer works with me and despite how much I like hanging out with him , will I continue to see him ? How often do we all enjoy the friendship of our co-workers but we never see them without their aprons on ? All too often . If I want to continue my friendship with Brendan , I no longer can depend on a work schedule to maintain it . I will have to actually make plans and then follow through on them . <p> Its odd when someone leaves a job . False promises are made . <p> " Let 's hang out real soon . Let 's do brunch or go out for cocktails . " <p> " Oh , totally . Ill call you next week . Just because we do n't  work together anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> A week passes by and neither of you have reached out to the other . Weeks turn into months and the only interaction that has happened is when one of you " liked " a Facebook status and then the other person- wrote " LOL . " <p> Brendan has been gone for less than a week , but the job does n't  feel the same anymore . How am- I supposed to take a picture of my shitty ass shift meal without him sitting across the table from me to let me know when it shows up on his Facebook feed ? Who will appreciate my epic eye rolls when a certain customer plops down at the bar and starts talking about , basically , nothing . Who will crack funny jokes that- I will steal as my own for this blog and my Twitter feed ? <p> I will do my best to hang out with Brendan and his wife soon . The next time I see an Event from them , I will make more of an effort to go . But I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of " really cool people I used to work with . " Could he go the way of Lauren and Bill- who always made me laugh but I have not seen since I left VYNL four years ago ? - Or Mike from my catering days ? Or maybe Jennifer Z. all the way back from my - sentence at Houlihans in Times Square ? I hope not . <p> We call the people we meet at work our friends but its not until you start seeing them outside of the restaurant that " friend " is the right word . Until then , we are simply co-workers , right ? We have to try really hard to make that transition from co-worker to friend and its not easy . It is possible though . I met my friend Jane at that same Houlihans over 15 years ago and we still see each other . In fact , I hope she is coming to our place for dinner next week . Restaurant friendships can turn into actual friendships , they just take some cultivating . Who knows what will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him soon at- a bar and we can drink together without calling it a " tasting . " If not , at least we will always have our time together at that crappy job that we both kept for- too long because it was so close to our apartments . 
@@106055447 @1455447/ <h> Category Archives : supreme court <p> Today is the second day that the Supreme Court is hearing arguments about Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act . I wont go into the specifics of what each of those means because most people have a pretty good idea already : same-sex marriage . If you are on Facebook , you ca n't help but notice how many people have changed their profile photos to some version of the equality sign so I had to get in on the act and make one that I feel represents my food service industry history . <p> On April 2nd , I will celebrate my one year wedding anniversary with my husband . One year of marriage may not seem all that impressive , but April 2nd will actually be our 22nd anniversary of being together . We spent the first twenty years or so waiting for people to realize that our relationship does not affect anyone elses and thankfully , New York State came to that realization in July of 2011 . I think a lot of people do n't  fully understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Maybe if I put it it in terms of food , it will make more sense . <p> If you go into a restaurant and look at the menu and see something that you would never order you simply order something else . If you do n't  want to eat quinoa you order the mashed potatoes instead . What you do n't  do is scour the restaurant to see if anyone else ordered quinoa so you can tell them how much you hate it . You do n't  make a cardboard sign that says " God Hates Quinoa " and picket their table . If they order quinoa and it sits on their plate and their plate alone , how will that affect your plate of mashed potatoes ? I cant think of any way that it would . Therefore , you simply eat your mashed potatoes and they eat their quinoa and both of you enjoy your dinner . Same-sex marriage is the same thing . <p> If you are a raw vegan and only eat cold zucchini lasagna with almond cheese that is your decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not mean that I think all raw vegan restaurants that serve cold zucchini lasagna with almond cheese should be shut down . I just make a conscious decision to eat elsewhere . Just like that person is not going to go to my favorite bar-b-q place and order brisket with mac and cheese . Vegans and carnivores can live happily amongst each other and they just agree to disagree . Same-sex marriage is the same thing . <p> Maybe someone thinks same-sex marriage is wrong because its unfamiliar to them and therefore scary . Its like me and seafood . I did n't  grow up eating seafood of any kind and as an adult , I still hated it . What I eventually realized was that when I said " I hate seafood , " what I meant to say was " I am unfamiliar with seafood . " Gradually , I tried it and now there are a few items that I like . No , I do n't  expect straight people to dabble in the world of homosexuality to see if they like it . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be willing to see if its something they can tolerate instead of hate . When I first tried shrimp , I tolerated it and now I like it . Is it my favorite thing to eat ? No , but I do n't  shudder at the thought of a plate of shrimp as I did when I refused to consider the possibility that shrimp can be very good and it is not threatening . Same-sex marriage is the same thing . <p> Lots of people are against same-sex marriage because they think the Bible says its wrong . I know that Leviticus 18:22 says , " Thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind : it is abomination . " But what about Leviticus 11:7-8 ? It says , " And the pig , because it parts the hoof and is cloven-footed but does not chew the cud , is unclean to you . You shall not eat any of their flesh , and you shall not touch their carcasses ; they are unclean to you " Have another bacon cheeseburger and consider that maybe every line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in time , this country will recognize same sex marriage as a right . Its happening and honestly , its happening faster than I ever expected it to . Forty years from now , it will seem silly that there was a time when so many people were against it . I hope that the Supreme Court makes the right decision . Marriage is something that everyone should have a right to ; gay , straight or even that drunk couple who met at a casino in Vegas and got married by an Elvis impersonator two hours later . Seriously , they have a right to get married and people who have been together for thirty years and raised children together do n't  ? It makes no sense . <p> Remember this : same-sex marriage is just like letting someone at the next table order quinoa when you order mashed potatoes . A starch is a starch and a marriage is a marriage . They 're just different . <p> I hope you will share this post .

@@106055448 @1455448/ <h> Monthly Archives : May 2012 <p> Since I do n't  know your names , I want to make sure you know that this letter is about you and for you . Let me describe you : two middle-aged women . The one on my left had hair that was in desperate need of a hot creatine oil injection while the one to my right looked like she had just used the last of her gift certificate to Casual Corner . You drank a Grey Goose and Tonic and a Desert Sunrise and then you ordered another round . You shared an an arugula salad , curry mussels and the penne pasta special . Recognize yourselves ? Okay , good . <p> We open at 5:00 so yes , it was absolutely alright that you knocked on the door at 5:01 to point at your watches and remind us that we were one whole minute late from unlocking our doors . I apologize for that . You see , it was just that the kitchen staff was a little bit behind that day so they did n't  make our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door one minute after we opened , we were still sitting down eating our dinner . But do n't  worry . I finished eating in the side stand while standing up . It was our fault for waiting so late to eat . <p> I am also sorry that I was unable to accommodate your request to seat you on the patio . You see , its just that it had been raining all day and it had only stopped raining about 15 minutes before you arrived . I simply had n't  had time to go wipe down all eight tables and all 16 chairs with a dry cloth so that it would be ready for seating . Since the weather forecast had predicted continuous rain all evening , it seemed unlikely that anyone would want to sit there as rain water dripped from the tress and the tables sat in puddles of water . Again , my fault . <p> It was nice talking to you about Coney Island . Remember how we talked about that ? Dry-Hair-Lady , you mentioned that you were thinking of going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty sure it did n't  open until after Memorial day so do n't  go all the way out there unless you know for sure . You thanked me for that . After all , we both know how long of a subway ride it is , right ? I shared that story about the time my friend and I went out there and it was closed and how disappointed we were . Casual-Corner-Lady , you seemed like you were too busy to talk because you were investing all of your energy into your cocktail and your cell phone . I thought the three of us had a good thing going . We chatted and laughed and you loved everything . <p> Your check was $66.41 . You left $68.00 which meant I got a tip for $1.59 . What the fuck is your problem ? I was totally nice to you , I got your food and drinks out so fucking fast , I apologized for not having the front door unlocked on time and you loved your food . Is 2.4% your idea of a good tip ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had I known that you were going to leave me a completely crap tip , maybe I would have left the door locked and finished my shift meal in peace . Do n't  bother coming back to the restaurant again unless you are showing up with an apology and $11.59 to cover the rest of what you should have left me . Its people like you who give dry fly-away hair and the good customers of Casual Corner a bad name . I do n't  like you . If you come back in , I will not be nice . You suck and you wasted my time . <p> Love , The Bitchy Waiter 109838 @qwx969838 <p> May 29th is one of the most special and reverent days of all 365 days of the year . It was on this day , a certain number of years ago before cell phones , iPads and the discovery of fire , that my mother pushed out 7 pounds and 11 ounces of bitch and ended up with a curly haired moppet destined for a life of average . Rumor has it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I slapped him right back and then asked him how hed like his burger cooked . He handed me to a nurse who wrapped me up in an apron and placed me in a bread warmer . She gave me a piece of paper that had my sidework on it and the rest is history . <p> I get a lot of photos from people who want to share little bits of their jobs with me . I got these two photos on the same day showing how vastly different tips can be from customer to customer . As fellow birthday girl Lisa " Blair Warner " Welchel says , " You take the good , you take the bad , you take them both and there you have : the facts of life . " <p> Anyway , back to me . May 29th is a great day to be born . Do n't  believe me ?

If you want to give me something for my birthday , you already have just by reading this . And if you want to give me something else , just share this blog post by clicking " Like . " <p> I always considered my childhood a good one . I had two loving parents and two younger brothers and I remember being a happy child . It turns out my youth was not as idyllic as I thought , because not once was I ever given booze by a waitress who was n't paying attention . Man , my childhood sucked . Well , everything old is new again , because we have reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If its not a drunk ass baby The Olive Garden then its a drunk ass baby at Applebees . <p> A restaurant in Clearwater , Florida is the latest establishment to be all trendy by serving liquor to a child . Two moms took their kids on a Mothers day outing to a place called Frenchys South Beach Cafe . The kids had earned a " special treat " so the moms ordered them each a virgin strawberry daiquiri . The waitress hit the wrong button on the computer and the next thing they knew , two four year olds were partying like rock stars at Club Med . One of them drank the whole daiquiri in ten minutes which says two things : number one , frozen daiquiris are the bomb and number two , this kid a has a real future as a lush . The other child did not drink his which says one of two things : either the kid was holding out for a Guinness or the moms only ordered one strawberry daiquiri and they are saying that both kids drank them so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receipt , I only see one strawberry daiquiri , so " I 'll go with moms being all dramatical , for a thousand Alex . " <p> Shortly after though , one kid " started acting a little strange , falling asleep , stumbling over things then he started vomiting . " Damn four year olds , cant ever hold their liquor . The child was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance where the doctors were probably like , " Yes a four year old should not be drinking daiquiris . I would suggest starting out with something like a wine cooler or maybe a gin and tonic . Also , it helps if they drink plenty of water as they go on their alcohol binge and always follow it up with a banana and an aspirin . " <p> No charges are expected to be filed against the restaurant or the waitress since it was pretty clear that this was an accident and there was no intention to get a kid trashed on Mothers Day . The moms , understandably , want some kind of system in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they die , " said one overly dramatic mom . Its called " plastic cups , " people . That way you know that nothing alcoholic ever goes into plastic , kids never have a glass that might have alcohol in it and it also means when the kid knocks that shit over ( and they will ) the glass wont break . <p> It does seem to be happening a lot lately or maybe it happened all the time and thanks to videos and stories " going viral " we just hear about it more often now . Either way , its my cue to go to Party City and buy myself a baby costume and head right over to my nearest Olive Garden , Applebees or Frenchys South Beach cafe and order a smoothie and keep my fingers crossed that it will show up as a cocktail but they will only charge me the non-alcoholic beverage price . <p> Something I do n't  understand is why rich people always feel like they are entitled to free stuff even though they are in that certain percentage of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it all the time at my job . " Table 3 is a VIP . He s a very famous actor who works on Broadway all the time , has a Tony award and just started shooting his own television series . Bring me his check so I can comp it . " Meanwhile , table 4 is a struggling singer who took the night off from her restaurant job to come see her friends show and she has to buy bottled water because she cant afford a cocktail . Its not right . The bubble that rich people have around them is very often a bubble that was created by others . <p> I recently got an email from a server in Yuma , Arizona who wanted to let me know that his state senator , Jon Kyl came into the restaurant a few weeks ago . I wont say the name of the restaurant because I do n't  want the server to get fired . Senator Kyl came in with three other men and they proceeded to order about $100 worth of food ; a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steak , four orders of fries and four large drinks . The men told the server the food was great and the service was great but you know what they left for a tip ? A big fat pile of nothing . Really , Jon Kyl ? Isnt enough that Jon Stewart hates you ? But now you want to make sure that servers across the country think you are a total asswipe too ? I did a quick Google search for the annual salaries of state senators and I think you are making about $174,000 a year . That means that you probably could have cobbled together the fifteen fucking percent that you should have left for your server since he is probably making the minimum wage for tipped employees in Arizona which is $4.65 an hour . That 's about the cost of one of the orders of french fries your table had . <p> According to Senator Kyls website , he is serving his third and final term in the U.S. Senate . In 2008 , he was elected to serve as Republican Whip which is exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the 0% tip waiting for him . It is inexcusable . <p> Politicians are always seen in little diners across the country when they are pandering to the voters . I guess they think that surrounding themselves with salt of the earth people in humble little watering holes makes them seem more approachable and more like regular people . You 're not regular people , politicians . Most of you have money and a lot of it which automatically makes you unlike anyone I know . No one is buying that you just happened to stop by the little diner on Main Street to have a burger and a beer . We all know you are there to get some press . <p> " I 'm a regular person . " <p> " I 'm a regular person . " <p> " I 'm a regular douchebag . " <p> Well , here is some press for you , Jon Kyl : servers depend on tips . Our pay checks are next to nothing . Those dimes and quarters that people toss on the table are what goes into our pockets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Its our salary . Most of us do n't  have insurance benefits from our jobs and even fewer of us get any kind of retirement plan from waiting tables so every time you stiff one of us , it puts us deeper into the hole . I hope this blog gets shared by everyone who reads it so that eventually it will float over to your office in Arizona . Maybe then you will do the right thing and have your ass chauffeured back over to Yuma where you can find you server and say , I 'm really sorry I forgot to tip you when I was here last week . I know you work hard and its tough to make ends meet when you are depending on tips . here 's $20.00 . Thank you so much for the great job you did . I really appreciated it .

I slid into a banquette and was greeted by the shining face of an angel . Whitney recited the specials but I knew that nothing was going to change my mind because the burger already had my name on it . However , when she described the special cocktail of the day , I was convinced that beer was no longer a priority . Muddled lemons , citrus vodka , triple sec and topped with champagne . When I took the first sip , I knew I had found The Greatest Love of All . It was sweet and sour at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickle my nose and slide down my throat with ease . ( If I had a dollar for every time I 've typed those words ) I took a second sip . " You Give Good Love , " I whispered to it .

" You just let me know when you 're ready . " <p> I spent the next ten minutes or so taking lewd pictures of my cocktail ( if I had a dollar for every time Ive taken lewd pictures of cocktails ) and sending them to Facebook and Twitter because that 's what I do . In the meantime , I struck up a conversation with Whitney . She explained to me that she was not supposed to work that night because she had tickets to a Mets game ( I think that 's baseball ) but someone called out and they told her she had to come to work . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Baby Tonight " and she came right in . My ass would n't have even picked up the phone if I saw that it was from the restaurant and it was my day off . The only time they call you on your day off is when they need you to come in . But she picked up and came to work . " I was in such a bad mood when I got here , but you are making my night worth it . " Maybe she was just buttering me up for a tip , but I kinda believed that we were clicking and I got So Emotional that I ordered another martini . I also ordered my burger . <p> Whitney and I kept talking and I learned that she was from Arkansas , or the " forgotten state " as she called it . " Close to Texarkana . " I suddenly remembered that Arkansas borders Texas so I had found another reason to like this girl : we had both escaped the clutches of small southern towns and made it to the Big Apple where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Love is Your Love , " I thought . As I sipped my second martini , we soon discovered that I had once been her server at the restaurant I work at which was right down the street . See ? We were destined to cross paths . My burger came out and after she did her two-minute check-back , I knew that this girl knew what she was doing . She kept my water filled and when my cocktail was down to its last sip , she appeared bearing gifts . " I 've had such a good time talking to you , so I brought us a shot . Its chocolate cake ; vanilla vodka and Frangellico ! " We clinked our shot glasses and swallowed it All at Once . ( If I had a dollar for every time I 've swallowed it all at once ) It was so good . I finished my burger and ordered a third martini . Feeling pretty buzzed at this point , I thought I Wan na Dance With Somebody but instead I took more pretty pictures of my drink as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done at 11:00 and seeing that it was now 10:45 , I asked for the check so I could close it out . I thanked her for the night and told her that if she is ever so bored that she has absolutely nothing else to do , she could check out my blog because I was going to be writing something about her . She said she would , but who knows if she will ? I paid my bill and told her how much I appreciated the One Moment in Time we had shared . I finished my drink and stumbled my drunk ass Step By Step out of the restaurant and back home . I Will Always Love You , Whitney . The next time I need a great martini and an even better server , I will Run To You . Thank you for a great evening . I wish you could have just sat down and had another drink with me ; Did n't  We Almost Have It All ? <p> I woke up the next morning wondering Why Does It Hurt So Bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the shot . How Will I Know when I have had too much to drink ? Oh , well . It was worth it , Whitney . Three martinis and a shot ? Its Not Right But Its Okay . Thank you , Whitney .

Thanks for making my night , the next day I was already following you on twitter and stalking you . I hope I see you again soon for drinks ! ! Thank you for everything !

While I am at the pool , why do n't  you read about some gay dog in Australia . <p> xo , The Bitchy Waiter <p> I was perusing the internet news the other day trying to find something to pique my interest when I came across a news item that happened at a restaurant down under . In Australia . I do n't  know what those people are sprinkling on their Vegemite sandwiches , but they might be a bit crazy . But then again all my knowledge about Australia comes from Crocodile Dundee and Men at Work so what do I know ? <p> Apparently , this blind man wanted to go eat at a Thai restaurant so he asked a waiter if it would be alright if he came in with his guide dog . ( There was a sign saying guide dogs were welcomed , but maybe someone missed the memo that said blind people do n't  read signs . Its like those signs on the subway that ask if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign is in English so anyone who may benefit from the sign ca n't fucking read the sign . Vicious vicious circle . Anyhoo . ) So the waiter went to ask the owners if it was alright for the dog to come in but he did n't  hear the word " guide " dog . The stupid ass waiter heard " gay " dog . Uh huh . And then the owners said no the dog couldnt come in because it was gay . Okay , all together now : what the fuckity fuck fuck ? This is wrong on so many levels . Even if this was an actual homosexual canine who liked to get it on with members of the same sex , why would that be the reason the dog couldnt come in ? They were going to persecute this dog because they thought it was gay ? How stupid was the waiter to see a blind man and not know that it was a guide dog ? Now if Elton John had sashayed into the restaurant wearing a frilly frock while holding a dildo and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blind man with sunglasses , a cane and a dog with a handle on it ? Gay dog ? No , dumb ass . Guide dog . <p> The man left the restaurant and then presumably filed a complaint and blah blah blah . But when the owners were explaining the situation to the court , they said if they would have known it was a guide dog , it would have been fine . They just thought the dog was gay and that was why it was n't welcome . I do n't  know these restaurant owners , but I pretty much hate them . They seem small minded , ignorant , rude and clueless . Basically , your typical restaurant owner/manager . They had to issue the blind dude an apology and pay him $1400 in compensation . And in Australia , $1400 buys a lot of Vegemite . <p> And in case you are wondering , Vegemite is is " a dark brown Australian food paste made from yeast extract . It is a spread for sandwiches , toast , crumpets and cracker biscuits and and filling for pastries . " Thanks Wikipedia. 109837 @qwx969837

@@106055457 @1455457/ <h> Tag Archives : sneaky waiters <p> This is the story of a sneaky waiter who used dishonest tactics to increase his check average . Please do not do what this waiter did . <p> Helmut and Inga were about to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary . Looking to do something special , Inga researched Yelp and found a nearby French staurant that had great reviews . " Oh , I 've heard about this place , " she told her husband . " Its supposed to be really good . Want to go there on Saturday night , dear ? " <p> Inga took the silence as a yes and made a reservation for 7:00 on Saturday . <p> Four days later , Inga and Helmut arrived at Place de Vosges Cafe . Inga had hoped for a corsage or maybe a card or at the very least for her husband to open the car door for her , but she settled for the fact that he wore a shirt that had a collar on it and a tie that matched . They were ushered to their table which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had white roses in a crystal vase on the center of the table . <p> " Oh , its beautiful ! Isnt it beautiful , Helmut ? Im having such a wonderful time already and the night has n't  even started . I love you so much , dear . " <p> " Kinda expensive , huh ? Jeez , they sure are proud of their soup . Its $15 . " <p> The tuxedoed waiter stepped away from the table and Inga couldnt tell if he had somewhere else to go , if he was judging them , or both . <p> " Helmut , dear . This is our 20th anniversary . I have been saving money for this night for two months and I do n't  want us to even think about the prices . I love you and I want us to have a wonderful night . Please , have a good time tonight . For me ? " <p> Helmut set down his menu and reached across the table to hold Ingas hands . " Sweetheart , the steak is $52 . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer the question . Helmut was again looking at the menu , his eyes bulging out and the veins in his neck throbbing . <p> " Its our 20th anniversary tonight , " said Inga beaming with pride . <p> " Ah , congratulations to you both ! I will make sure then that we take extra good care of you this evening . Extra good care , I say . " He snapped his fingers and a man appeared who filled their glasses with Pelligrino . The waiter recited the specials and within minutes Inga had the glass of champagne she wanted while Helmut sipped a cold beer . Inga convinced him to drink it from the frosted glass that had been provided rather than from the bottle like he usually enjoyed his beer . He finally seemed to be enjoying himself and she did n't  even care that he had loosened his tie and unbuttoned his collar . <p> As the waiter removed the last plate , Helmut said to his wife , " Im stuffed . I do n't  think I have any room for dessert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you sure ? I bet its delicious here . Just one to share ? " <p> " Naaa , let 's go home , " he said . " I 'm full .

" <p> " Its not about the money , I 'm just full , " snapped Helmut . <p> At this time , Inga saw the waiter approaching their table holding a plate with a dessert and a lighted candle . He placed it in front of the couple . " Happy anniversary to you both , " he said . The plate was inscribed with those very words , written in chocolate . In the middle of the plate was a large serving of bread pudding with two two chocolate-covered strawberries . " <p> " How sweet , " sighed Inga . " Look dear , an anniversary dessert ! " She blew out the candle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite to her husband who begrudgingly acknowledged that it was quite delicious . They cleaned their plate and ten minutes later the check was presented to them . <p> Inga reached over to pick it up , prepared for the total which would be more than they had ever spent on one meal . She scanned the bill and her eyes landed on one item that gave her pause . " Hmmm , " she said . " Oh , well , its okay . " <p> " What 's wrong ? " Helmut wanted to know . <p> " Nothing , its fine . No big deal . " <p> " What is it ? " he insisted . <p> " Well , they charged us for the dessert and I kind of thought they were just being nice for our anniversary . I 'm just surprised , that 's all . It was only $14 . Of course well pay for it , it was delicious . " <p> Helmut sat up straight in his chair . That 's not right , they made it sound like it was free . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Wheres that waiter ? " <p> " Please , dear , its fine . Ill just pay for it . " <p> " No , its not fine .

" <p> " I 'm not going to make a scene , I 'm just going to let him know that I think if we are going to be paying for dessert than we should have gotten to choose what it was and I did n't  even want dessert in the first place . " <p> Inga reached out across the table and placed her hand on her husbands . " Please ? Can we just go ? I do n't  want tthe night to end like this . " <p> " Fine . But I did n't  want dessert anyway . " <p> Their drive home was quiet , both of them thinking about how shifty the waiter had been . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why her husband was so upset . When they got home , Helmut got out of the car quickly and went into the house leaving Inga to walk in alone . As she stepped inside , the only light on was the one in the kitchen . She followed the light and heard Helmut getting something out of the refrigerator . " Helmut ? You cant tell me you 're still hungry . " She stepped into the kitchen to see Helmut standing in front of her holding a box . " What 's that ? " she asked . <p> " This is why I did n't  want dessert . Remember our first anniversary when we still lived in Brooklyn and we were so broke ? All we could afford to do that day was spend $5 so we went to that little tiny bakery on Court Street and each picked out one dessert and then we shared them . " He opened the box revealing a lobster tail and a cannoli .

I love you very much , Inga . Happy anniversary . " He kissed her and then said , " Are you too full for another dessert ? " <p> Inga wiped the tears from her eyes and looked at her husband . She reached over to him and untied his tie and pulled it from his neck . " I love you so very much . You 're the sweetest man in the world . " <p> " No , I 'm just the happiest one . Want a bite ? " <p> They sat at the kitchen table taking turns eating the pastries having completely forgotten about the sneaky waiter who had tricked them into buying a dessert that did n't  even want .

After you have given proper respect to both of those events , then please turn your attention to the the real reason that April 22 is so damn important . Today is the 85th birthday of Charlotte Rae , also known as Mrs. Garrett from The Facts of Life . It is no secret that I have a thing for this classic television show as evidenced here . I even dreamed about it a few days ago . In that dream I went to Central Park to meet some friends and when I got there , all of the girls from the show were lounging on a blanket behind us . They were all in bikinis and lookin good . Even Natalie . Within moments , I was hanging out and having a picnic with them . Can dreams like this really come true ? God , I hope so . <p> So what does Charlotte Rae have to do with The Bitchy Waiter ? Gim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Okay , got it . You know on the second season of the show , Charlotte lost a lot of weight so the producers wanted to write it into the script . Therefore they changed her role on the show and Mrs. Garrett went from being housemother to all the girls to being the dietitian for the school cafeteria . All the girls worked there and there were many episodes that had them clearing tables and bussing trays . That Natalie really knew how to hold a bus tub . In another episode , Jo decided to become an entrepreneur and started selling pizzas from a recipe handed down from her mother , Rose . In this episode , Charlotte Rae gives her finest line reading of all time , " What 's that wonderful smell ? " ( at the 18 second mark ) . You see ? More food service involving Mrs. Garret and the girls . They were practically the original Bitchy Waitresses and Mrs. Garret was head bitch . And who can forget their foray into business when they opened Ednas Edibles which was a bakery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service and food , just like my life . The store eventually burned down because producers were probably sick of looking at that set that consisted of wicker baskets and breads and wanted something hip and cool to keep the kids interested . This is when they took the show into the wrong direction by opening a gift shop called " Over Our Heads " where they sold inflatable palm trees , records by Oingo , Boingo and other stupid ass shit . This was when Charlotte Rae knew she needed to jump that ship and get the hell out of Dodge . <p> But happy birthday to you , Charlotte Rae . I wish you would come into my station so I could sing a song to you and present you with a semi-thawed birthday cake with a dirty birthday candle that I found in the back of the drawer underneath an old menu insert . But for you , I would really mean it when I sang . For you are my food service inspiration for the day . <p> " You take the good , you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , the facts of life . " And one fact if life is that all good things must come to an end . I am one sour bitch today because my vacation is over . Within a few hours , I will be back in New York City where according to my averagely-smart phone , the weather is cloudy and rainy with a 95% chance of I-hate-it-here . I had some great service here in South Beach . The one thing I noticed though is that almost every single server was in no hurry to give us our check . Maybe its because the tip is already included and they were like , " whatever " but I hate waiting for my check . When my cocktail is empty and my plate has been licked clean ( seriously , I have no shame when it comes to a good sauce ) , I want my check .

My exterior must remain tough and strong even though inside I am a soft mass of messy emotion . I liken myself to televisions Jo Polniaczek from The Facts of Life played by serious actress Nancy McKeon . Sure , on the outside she was a tough as nails , no-nonsense closet dyke who never let anyone see her soft side .

And who is going to do my turn-down service ? And when I need ice , I will have to go to my kitchen to get it instead of dialing housekeeping ? This sucks ! This sucks ! " On the outside , my eyes are dry . On the inside they are wet with tears . And they might be a little bit bloodshot .

I saw- her one time sitting in her car before work and it looked like she was sniffing a spray paint can .

@@106055463 @1455463/ <h> Monthly Archives : March 2010 <p> From reading my blog , some people may gain the impression that I am ashamed of what I do for a living . Is it my ideal profession of choice ? Fuck no . Am I good at it ? Fuck yes . Believe it or not , I do take my job very seriously on occasion and I feel that if I am going to be a waiter , at least let me be a good one . Despite the thoughts that may be rolling around in my head ( ie : I hate this job , this lady is annoying me , that lady is annoying me , when do I get off , of course I will bring your food to you when its ready , that guy has ugly teeth , etc ) , for the most part I keep those thoughts to myself and try to do my job with aplomb . <p> Years ago I saw a musical called Working . It was about all these different people and the jobs they had . One song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who kicked ass at her job and she really got a kick out of doing it . I must admit , that sometimes that happens to me . You ever have one of those shifts where your station is totally full and everyone needs something but nothing fazes you ? You 're in the zone and everything flows as easily as a frozen margarita goes down my throat . The girl who played the part when I saw it was really great and she had all this cool choreography that involved her spinning her tray and jumping onto tables and shit . I barely remember it though because it was about twenty years ago and if my calculations are correct then I would have been about four or five years old . ( I am in my mid-twenties . I am in my mid-twenties , I am in mid-twenties ) . Anyhoo , someone ( holla out to Steven A. ) sent me a video clip of the amazing Rita Moreno doing this number and I shall now share it with you .

Polish that silver with joy , Jerry ! And do some dancing on the tabletops . We are waiters and we are proud ! ( okay , I just threw up in my mouth a little bit . ) <p> Is it creepy to let you know that I was reading the obituaries the other day ? Its not a regular kind of habit or anything that I have to sit around and read about people expiring , but sometimes they 're full of interesting tidbits about the life of a dead person . Its sorta like reading a biography but instead of a whole book , you only have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found one that caught my eye the other day : <p> Ethel A.

She was 101 . <p> Did you catch the word that made me stop and read this obit ? Ethel was a waitress . And a poet too , but a waitress . I went on to read the rest of the write up and learned that she was a waitress for twenty years of her life and the last time she waited tables was like in 1946 . So she had n't  been a waitress for sixty-four years and had gone on to marry , own a couple of businesses , get some poetry published , and have a really full life but the first thing mentioned in her obituary is that she was a waitress ? Is that how I will be remembered when I go to that great big side stand in the sky ?

This crappy ass piece of writing that is spewing from my fingers right this second will be around long after Im gone . Maybe my obit could read : <p> Bitchy Waiter , retired waiter , blogger and kick ass tipper , died yesterday at 101 . He was totally bitchy but he did a lot of other shit that did n't  involve holding a tray so do n't  think he was just like this loser or anything . <p> I say we all raise a glass in honor of this kick ass lady who lived to be a hundred and one fucking years old . She had kids and grand kids and wrote some poetry . In a whole century of living she only used twenty years to be a waitress. 20% of your life waiting tables is not too shabby . Right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Smith . I hope when you got to the Pearly Gates , Saint Peter , Paul or Mary was there asking you how you wanted your burger cooked and then they threw in a free dessert and comped your check . <p> Does anyone else have their foot in their mouth so often that you have grown accustomed to the taste ? Do you look at your toes as appetizers and your feet as the main course with a side of crow for dessert ? Generally I am pretty good about keeping my thoughts just that : something that I alone can hear , but occasionally my insides bubble over with rage and frustration and my voice spews out what my brain is thinking . Sometimes its possible to mask it with humor and people do n't  realize how much truth there is in the statement . Example : A customer comes in ten minutes before closing and says , " Oh , is it okay if we eat now ? Are you going to hate us ? " And then I say , " No. its fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be cursing you and your unborn children . " Then I laugh and roll my eyes and touch them on the elbow and say , " just kidding . " But I 'm not kidding . <p> A few years ago , I was serving a a party of ten or twelve people . They were all really loud and none of them would pay any attention to me when ever I tried to talk to them . Throughout the meal , I got progressively more frustrated with them and they never even noticed . By the time their plates were cleared and I was asking about dessert and coffee they had completely forgotten that there was a waiter there . Repeatedly , I asked if anyone wanted anything and only the lady next to me paid any attention and ordered an apple pie ala mode . Clearing my throat , I repeat , " So does anyone want dessert or coffee ? Anyone ? Hello ? ? " Again , they all ignored me . I had had it . " OKAY ! So the only one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the table ? ? " Did I really just say that ? The table got quiet and all looked at me and then they looked at the fat ass who wanted pie . A deathly silence hung over the table and it seemed to last longer than The Blind Side ( starring Academy award winner , Sandra Bullock ) as everyone looked at Fat Ass to see how she was going to respond to the horribly rude waiter who had just insulted her in front of her friends . She paused . I held my breath . I looked at her . She slowly turned her head in my direction and our eyes locked . And then she said , " Thats right I 'm the only one who wants dessert , I guess , so bring it on ! " And then she laughed . I laughed and told her I would be right back with it . I comped it . My inside voice thought it was the least I could do . I had once again firmly planted my foot inside my mouth which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have eaten it . Bitch was hungry . <p> Why ca n't people move the hell out of my way ? Last night at work , the show had more performers than there were audience members . There were about 525,600 singers and about 15 paying guests . What that meant was all of the singers were milling about the room and sitting wherever the hell they wanted making it near impossible to serve drinks to the people who were there to see the show . Wouldnt you think if I consistently bump into your chair every single fucking time I walk past you , then just maybe your chair is too far out into the aisle and you should pull it in a bit ? You would think , but not with these folks . One man did n't  want to sit inside the booth , he wanted to sit with his legs sticking out of the booth so when I walked past him , I slammed the hell out of his knee . It was really hard , Like Joan Crawford on Christina kind of hard . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , really it was an accident . The first time . And then after the show , all the singers wanted to stand around and compliment each other and hope to get a compliment in return . It was ridiculous . They just stood there with needy looks on their faces that said , " Somebody please tell me I was good . Please ? " But they did n't  get out of the way . I had to squeeze past them about twenty times.Once a lady even said , " oh dear , we are totally in your way , I 'm sorry . " But she did n't  move . She was just sorry . <p> And its not just at work either . On an escalator , why do people have to just stand there ? If you are going to stand on an escalator , then do it on the right side , so those of us who still recall how to walk up stairs can continue to do so . And at the grocery store , it is not okay to park your stroller with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will push sleeping baby out of the way in order to get to my Amys mac and cheese . And on the subway , when I am getting off the train , do not stand directly in front of the doors so I cant get off . I will shove through you and knock your ass out of the way , little old Asian lady . <p> On those days here in New York City where its sunny and mild and the birds are singing and the daffodils are blooming , it sure makes it hard to drag ones ass to work . We have so few nice days here , that it seems a crying shame to waste one on something so lame as employment . Seriously , we get about two weeks of nice weather between blizzards and hot and humid and today is one of them . However , work beckons and I shall answer the call . But more than likely I will be in a bad mood unless I find a way to alter it . The first thought is some type of mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A cocktail ? No , too early in the day . Call out ? Not cool . I am left with one possibility : tricking my mind into believing I am in a good mood . <p> I heard one time that if you force yourself to smile for at least eight minutes , the muscle memory triggers your brain into thinking that the smile is real and your bad mood will up and vanish . Weirdly , it actually works . Years ago when I was working at Black Eyed Pea on Highway 290 in Houston , I drove to work each morning . I was at the end of my Pea time and it was a real struggle to even pretend that I gave a shit . Then I heard about this little trick on National Public Radio . I listen to NPR because I am real intelligent and shit . So I tried it . I would get into my car for the twenty minute drive and I would plaster this fake ass smile on my face and keep it there . I be looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Vaseline covered teeth as I drove my ass through Houston . But by the time I got to work , I felt better . I did this every day for several weeks and every time it somehow put me in a better mood . Of course the shitty mood would come right back as soon as some bitch would ask for a second hot tea because she ripped the first tea bag , but at least the good mood was there for a while . <p> Now that I live in New York City , I do n't  employ this technique anymore . Sitting in my car alone with a huge shit eating grin on my face is one thing , but doing that on the 7 train is not going to happen . Here in the city , the only people who are sitting alone on the subway and smiling like demons are the same people who are taking dumps in their pants and swatting imaginary flies . So now I embrace my bad mood . I welcome it . I accept it . And I take it to work with me.

Okay , I despise the parents , but the toddler is the one I tell to go sit down or turn around . So , I am bitchy mom and grandmother . Do I care ? Not a bit . Great post as usual . I love your blog . <p> Nothing beats hearing screaming out of control kids on your special date . A lil bit ago I decided to treat myself to adult only time and hit up Bee 's and Garcias for appetizers and plenty of drinks . I made sure to go out late at night to make sure there would be no kids- I mean I left mine at home so I could enjoy party time . Half way into my 4th fishbowl sized drink I was jarred out of my happy mood by a screaming baby . I flipped out thinking my kids had somehow killed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents with there baby at Bee 's working their way into a drunken stupor while Jr screamed . I tuned him out with the help of the bartender and several shots , mixed drinks and god knows what else . Two hours later I bid my new best friend goodbye leaving him a tip that was almost more then my bill . <p> You go ! I have kidsgrown nowbut I remember those days . Personally , I was embarrassed when my kids acted up . I took it for awhile , tried to smooth it , but if my kids did n't calm down , I was the one to leave . Even in the middle of a meal . Having been there , I see parents who do NOT leave when their kids are being a pain in the ass as weak , useless , and deserving of the criticism evoked in your post . Keep up the good work ! <p> I do n't have kids , by choice . I do n't hate kids but do n't particularly want to be in a restaurant with kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't want kids but my mum moved in with us and now we have an old kid who throws a tantrum when told off and what can you do about itrespect the elderly ! ! ! Aaaah . <p> Wow that 's classic . I wish there were more restaurants like this one ! I also think that if you are going to leave a negative comment you should atleast write your name . I mean what is the use if you keep hiding behind anonymity ? Seriously if you have an opinion let it be heard and stamp your name on it . Take credit for being such a negative Nancy .. Lol Anyways I love all your post they are hilarious and please do not stop being a bitchy waiter for those haters out there ! <p> really good post . but it got to me the part about someone calling you selfish for not having kids . I applaud you . the world is over populated and resources are limited . People should n't see having kids as a mandatory thing when you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many parents know how to stop the crying . At the grocery store , there is either the parent that 's life is in such a daze that they do n't  even notice the screams or the parent that nearly cusses out their kids in front of everyone and they seem just as psychotic . <p> Totally agree with you.I do not have any children myself , but I love them . I work in a toy shop . I hear screaming every single day . In the shop , it 's OK , I will smile and tell the parents not to worry . It 's part of the job , it does n't bother me . But when I leave the shop , I want time to chill out and relax . I do n't want to go out and still have them screaming at me . That 's partly why I do n't have my own children ( yet ) , I like my own time too much ! Also , parents usually say something like " oh , he 's just tired/grumpy/hungry , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , this is a lie . All they need to do is spend a few minutes giving them attention , cooing them , holding their hands , reassuring them , and they will be happy again . From what I 've seen , a lot of parents are idiots . <p> " cup of ( not hot enough , herbal ) tea " That type of thing happens way too often by the way . The water was hot when I served the tea to you , but when you finally drank it 10 minutes later , it was n't . Sorry , not my problem . <p> Selfishness is not having or having children selfishness is when you are inconsiderate of others . We have a two-year-old and a roommate . Our wee-one is 90% delightful and 10% terror.During one of her fits the other night , I said to our roomie , " If this annoys me , it has to be murder for you sorry " , he shrugged and said " Whadda ya goin ' to do ? " Yes , parents should be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago that WE were the little monsters screaming in the restaurant . ( of course , we were usually beaten for it . . . ) <p> I am a mother of two myself , and I am right there with ya . My children did n't cause scenes in restaurants when they were young . When they were infants if we went somewhere with them and they started to cry we had our food packed up to go and left.I think it 's way past time for restaurants to take this step to try to preserve the sanity of their staff , as well as the other patrons . It 's simple actually , if you ca n't control your child stay the hell home . <p> I laughed out loud when I saw that sign I would go there in a heartbeat over some other kid-loving place . I pay for my food to get of your teat loving stool mothers and keep your kids in line or get the fuck out ! <p> Fuck the haters- you 're awesome . Do n't ever change.The haters are probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the speed limit because they 're on their cell phone while trying to get little Timmy to stop plastering boogers all over the window . I do n't see how they do n't get that no one gives one single , solitary shit about their stupid kids . <p> I only threw 1 tantrum I was 4 and my mom took my to packed church to see The Nativity scene . There was Mary , Joseph , the animals &amp; a little doll of Baby Jesus . Crowd was singing : " Little baby Jesus laying NAKED in a manger " When I heard the word NAKED I got eager wanting to see . Mayby ppl came here to pray , but for me it was opportunity to see some dick . My mom used me like battering ram so I can be able to see up close . Finally we arrived . I saw the holy child was covered with a piece of white cloth . I got pissed and yelled : Bullshit ! Not naked ! Has a rag on ! ! ! Some woman tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled again : Priest -Dick in a twist ! And mom had to use me again to part the crowds to get me outta there trying to gag me so I wont yell another obscenity . True story . I remember it pretty well . It happened in Catholic Church in Poland .

You can email me here if you have a question that needs attention . Or email me to say hello . That 's nice too . <p> Dear Bitchy Waiter , <p> I work in a restaurant , have been doing the classic rollup for years . The problem is the flap hangs out and does n't  always keep the silverware tight in the rollup . There was a person I worked with who rolled the silverware so that everything got tucked into the rollup , so it would n't come unwrapped . I cant remember how he did it ! ! ! ! : ) Do you know how to do that ? If not , where should I look ? Signed , David <p> Dear David , <p> I do know of this secret technique you speak of . Are you referring to the one where all the corners of the napkin are somehow practically invisible and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried to a drawer or bin ? The technique was taught to me by a Buddhist monk who lived in a cave in the mountains of the Himalayas . He was on a 40 year vow of silence and all he did was eat , pray , and do rollups . I went to this guru once so he could show me the art of mastering the rollup . Unfortunately , I made a solemn swear to him that I would only pass on his technique to people who worked with me and could volunteer to do my sidework for three weeks in exchange for the coveted information . Sorry , David . Besides , the place I work now is a class act super fancy place that uses paper napkins so I very rarely use the rollup technique anymore . Had you asked me how to wrap to-go item in foil into the shape of swans , geese , elephants , puppies , goldfish , Mariah Carey , antelopes or cantaloupes , I would happily direct you . But you did n't  so I wont . I did find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> youtube LONG ... <p> And David , I do apologize that I am unable to pass on the information that you need . The monks name was MahaTheraSayagi U Ba " Scooter " Khin and I know he would be very disappointed in me if I shared his knowledge . I am sure you understand , right David ? If the above video does not help you , I would suggest you take a quick trip over to Asia . There is a La Quinta in the foothills of the Himalayas that has a pretty good rate with a free Continental breakfast . The front desk can direct you to which cave Scooter lives in . Hed love to help you . Tell him I said hello . By the way , if you go , do n't  forget that Scooter is on a vow of silence so do n't  expect a lot of chit chat . Good luck ! <p> Love , The Bitchy Waiter 109839 @qwx969839 
@@106055473 @1455473/ <h> Reality ? Check , Please . <p> After a few weeks of living high on the hog and not waiting tables , reality is about to bitch slap me in the face and throw a tray in my hands . I go back to serving this week . Thankfully , it is only a couple of shifts before my vacation kicks in and then after vacation I get to be full time actor for two more weeks . In the meantime , I shall serve . It has been well over a fortnight since having the privilege of bringing people food and drink and I fear that I have lost my touch . What if I do n't  remember how to carry a tray ? Or what if I have forgotten how the computer works ? Or what if it slips my mind that I am at work and that vodka gimlet is for a customer and not me ? I fool myself . We all know that waiting tables is like riding a bicycle . A horribly evil bicycle without a seat on it that rams you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get back on it . Waiting tables is like herpes . It never ever goes away . Sometimes it might not be so bad but then all of a sudden a flare up happens and you go , " Oh yeahIm a waiter . " There is no cure for waiting tables . Even if you do n't  do it for a few years , all it takes is an apron around your waist to instantly recall your muscle memory and switch to automatic pilot . I went for two and half years once without working in a restaurant and by the end of my first day back I was doing it with one hand tied behind my back . The other hand was holding a steak knife and trying to stab out my eyes to avoid seeing that I was working in a restaurant again . <p> I can already see how my first day back at work will be . <p> Me : Hello there , sir . Do you know what youd like to drink ? Customer : Hey ! I have n't seen you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out of town doing a play . Do you know what youd like to drink ? Customer : A play ? Are you an actor ? Wow ! What play ? Me : Just a play . A musical , actually . Do you know what youd like to drink ? Customer : I did n't  know you were an actor . That 's great . How did I not know that ? Me : I guess it just never came up in our many one on one conversations . Do you know what youd like to drink ? Customer : Well , back to waiting tables I guess . Hardy harhar . Can I get a glass of water ? With lemon ? Me : I hate you.At this point , I will look around the room and realize that I am not a working actor anymore . I will then go to the bathroom and cry a little , wash my face and plaster a smile on my lips .

The hope will be floating on top of the vodka . 109837 @qwx969837 <h> 9 thoughts on " Reality ? Check , Please . " <p> Maybe that dream you had did mean that you are unhappy with waiting tables and want to expand your acting niche ? ? Just a thought , but even though we may ' hate ' our jobs , we still love them at the same time <p> I remember resigning myself to waiting tables until one of my customers said , " Do you want a tip ? " to which I replied yes and he proceeded to tell me to find a new professions . I quit that night and never looked back although I still have the urge to help when I go to a busy restaurant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a server , always a server . Thanks for your candid honesty with a hint of humor ! Good luck with your acting ! <p> " Waiting tables is like herpes . It never ever goes away . " .. I feel that way about my patients sometimes . Funny that being a nurse and being a waiter could be so damn similarwell not funny as much as depressing . <p> Awwww hahaha I would never do that to you . In BC , the hst on food started july 1st , so now I tip a little more $$$ I 'd rather do that than spew out cheesy , scornful comments I can never take back.And ' bitchyness ' I do n't think you have hidden feelings about fatherhood or brats . Unless you secretly love me. lol ! Well try to enjoy your holidays . I hear BC is nice . wink. 
@@106055474 @1455474/ <h> Monthly Archives : January 2013 <p> You know I have three different jobs and each one of them gives me something unique : one gives me a pain in the ass , one gives me a pain in the neck and one gives me benefits . At job number two , I serve cocktails and food during shows and on occasion we have a late show that starts at 11:30 PM . I especially dislike this shift because 11:30 is closer to the time I like to be leaving the job rather than just beginning it . <p> Its 10:45 and the 11:30 show has just been given " a go . " In other words , we have enough reservations to justify the performance so like it or not , my ass is going to be at work until at least 1:30 AM . The reservations seem to be all promotional deals such as Groupon and the like meaning the probability for shitty tips is pretty high . My mood is deflated knowing that my shift drink has been pushed back by at least two hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Every single person there has a coupon and instantly complains about the price and the two-drink minimum . <p> I approach table three . <p> " Hello and welcome . May I get you something to drink this evening ? " <p> As soon as I ask , I realize that this girl may be under 21 years old and I will have to card her . At the club , we do n't  normally get 21 year-olds . We cater to a more mature crowd who do not require carding because most of them had their birth certificates delivered via Pony Express and their drivers licenses were given to them for horse and buggies . <p> The young girl looks at the menu overwhelmed by either the selection or the $15 martini prices . <p> " Um , I du n no yet . Can I just start out with a chocolate mouse ? " <p> " Okay , one chocolate mousse , " I say . <p> " Oh my god , I meant mousse , not mouse . Oh my god . " She giggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vodka ' " she decides . <p> " Do you have i.d . for me ? " <p> She reaches into her bag which may or may not have had Dora the Explorer on it and hands me her license which confirms that she has been twenty-one years old for all of three months . I hand it back to her . " Thank you . I 'm sorry but we do n't  have Red Bull . " <p> If she did n't  see my eye roll then she must be blind because an epic eye roll it is . <p> " I 'm sorry , but we do n't  have any energy drinks . Is there something else I can get for you ? " <p> She seems to not quite comprehend what kind of place does n't  have Red Bull . Typically , I serve Manhattans , dry martinis and or an Old-Fashioned . We do not have energy drinks , nor do we have cotton candy flavored vodka or body shots . She finally decides on a Long Island Iced Tea because that 's what all 21 year-olds drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gin , tequila and rum ? Perfect . The other girl orders a Coke since she now knows I will card her ass if she tries to order anything else . <p> The two girls continue to annoy me during the show because they do n't  want a second drink since they " are so broke . " They have to get something though so I order them each a $5.50 bottle of water . They are talking during the show , taking pictures of each other , texting friends and checking their Facebook . Not only am I at work later than I want to be , I am stuck serving kids who I know are going to leave shit for tips . I try my hardest to disguise my disdain for them . My smile is phony , my politeness is forced and I am developing " the shakes " because my shift drink is eluding me . At long last , the show is over and I pass out my checks . Everyone pays quickly with the exception of the two girls who , because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not included . It turns out they know someone in the show who joins them at the table and begin to chat for another twenty minutes . I can see my tip sitting on the table- a wad of singles . I stand in the corner looking back and forth between them and the bottle of Chardonnay that I am not allowed to touch until the last customer has left . Finally , they leave . <p> " Good night , you guys . Thank you for coming in tonight . " Even I am surprised at how genuine it sounds . Seconds after they leave the club , I pour myself my shift drink and go pick up my tip : four dollars . It is now 1:40 AM and I made a total of $28 for the show . I would rather have left two and a half hours earlier without the money . <p> But now for the surprising part . So many people email me telling me what a horrible waiter I must be . They tell me I am rude and mean and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they would hate to ever be in my station . But this is how good of a waiter I am . I looked at Yelp a few days ago and saw a review for the night I just told you about . It reads : <p> We came here with a Groupon deal for admission to one of the late night ( post 11:30pm ) shows . Dessert was tasty , service was friendly and attentive ( even after he knew we had pre-purchased ) , and the show provided the sort of random and entertaining night that I love about NYC . I would definitely come back , but probably not at full price . <p> Even though I hated being there , hated my customer because I knew they were going to shaft me , I still gave them good service . That 's what makes a good server . Doing everything you can for your customer and never letting them know that you hate them with a passion . Am I a bitchy waiter ? Damn right , I am . Do my customers know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog like The Bitchy Waiter has a few perks . Honestly , I do n't  know what any of them are yet , but I am told this is the case . Occasionally , someone will send me an email inviting me to their bar or restaurant saying they will treat me like a king , but for all I know , I will show up and they will throw a net over me and haul me off into the East River . However , I did recently receive an email from the producer of an off-Broadway musical that caught my attention . At first I thought they wanted to ask my permission to turn my blog into a big splashy hot mess of a musical , but they actually just wanted to invite me to see their show . Its called Bare the Musical . I assumed that the show must have something to do with bitter middle-aged waiters so imagine my surprise when I read the synopsis and saw that it was n't . " Why would they want me to see this show . " I wondered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket and sat in the audience . Two minutes later I knew why they wanted me there : there are cocktail servers in the audience ! <p> I settled in for the show , cocktail in hand . Very quickly , the plot revolves around a gay couple in a catholic boarding school . One of them wants to " out " their relationship and the other one is further in the closet than a wool turtleneck sweater in July . There 's a bitchy sardonic outcast girl named Nadia played by Barrett Wilbert Weed ( my favorite and in the photo above ) , a smart-mouthed singing nun played by Missi Pyle ( my other favorite ) and choreography by Travis Wall from TVs So You Think You Can Dance . I used to write theatre reviews and I always felt the need to have a critical eye , but since this is my blog , I guess I can write whatever I want . I totally loved it . <p> The lead I saw was the understudy ( Alex Wyse as Peter ) and he rocked it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my myself 10 years ago . Okay , 15 years ago . Fine , 25 years ago . He just wanted to announce to everyone that he was in love with this wonderful guy and be happy , much like me in 1985 except I thought I was in love with Dawn , Brenda , Diane , Caryl and Lisa when in actuality I had the major hots for a guy named Guy . <p> The set is cool , the band is great , the jokes are funny ( Alice Lee as Diane made me laugh out loud once and I almost shot wine out of my nose ) and the audience is there to have a good time . ( Order a drink ! Order two ! ) <p> The music is sort of a pop score not unlike Rent . Everyone in the show is a great singer but more than that , it looked like they were all happy to be there . This brings me back to the cocktail servers in the audience who seemed to be the exact opposite of being happy to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine , I watched those three severs and wondered about them . This is New York City so the chances are pretty good that those servers are also aspiring actors . Here they are working in a theater just ten feet away from a stage , but they have on aprons and not costumes . How difficult it must be for them to watch this musical , night after night , and know how badly they want to throw that tray to the floor and rush up to the stage and sing a song with Elizabeth Judd who played Ivy , the girl in love with the closeted gay guy . I felt bad for those servers . So bad in fact , that I ordered another glass of wine from one of them just to make them feel better . I hope it helped . <p> Bottom line , I loved the show and its closing on Sunday February 3rd . If you are in New York City and want to see some good theater ( with cocktails , do n't  forget ) go check out Bare . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're like that row of teenage girls that was behind me , you will cry whenever something sad happens . I myself got a little teary a couple of times , mostly because Peter reminded me so much of myself , but partly because I know what its like to be serving cocktails when all you really want to do is be singing on a stage . <p> Well , file this under " warming the cockles of my tired black heart . " A reader named Whitney sent me an email explaining that a woman came into her station recently and asked for a quiet booth away from people . She then ordered a bottle of Merlot , spinach dip and worked on her laptop for the duration of the afternoon . <p> At this point , most of us servers with hardened attitudes are beginning to grumble things like , " If you do n't  want to be around people , then do n't  come into a restaurant " and " Great . Thanks for using my table as your office all day and not letting me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When the lady left , there was a note on the table along with a twenty dollar tip . The note said : <p> Thank you . I found out that I have cancer today . And I needed a quiet place to sit and work . Remember what 's important in life and no matter what , whatever the circumstance-be thankful . Even for the shitty stuff . Take care and thank you for letting me sit here.p.s . Sorry if any customers were offended- I did n't  realize my ear buds werent working right and blared Prince for a while . Oh well . <p> What can we learn from this , folks ? We can learn a few things , the least of which is that a cancer diagnosis cries out for spinach dip and Merlot . If it were me , I 'd probably be more of a nachos and margaritas or Pepsi and Butterfingers kind of guy , but you say potato and I say potato . ( That saying does n't  really work when typing it , does it ? ) We also learn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is down . What we really learn is almost a repeat of what I was trying to write about last week : be grateful . I suppose when you are told that you have cancer , then even the " shitty stuff " is better than the alternative , which is " no stuff . " It is n't that different from when my Mamo Rita would catch herself complaining about being old and realize that being old is better than being dead . I know that couple of my posts lately have been less about the bitchy and more about something else , but maybe 2013 is trying to remind me that waiting tables can give me extraordinary experiences and not just shitty ones . Besides , the letter is teaching me to be grateful for the shitty ones anyway . <p> As servers , I guess we have to be aware that , like it or not , we are affecting the lives of our customers , sometimes in a completely insignificant way but other times maybe quite a bit . Whitney was nice to to this woman without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than ever . What if Whitney had told her something like , " I 'm sorry , but I need to turn this table over so maybe you can go to Starbucks with your computer ? " Whitney , unknowingly , gave the woman exactly what she needed that day which was a quite place to sit and work . But Whitney also gave the woman something else : kindness . Could it be that more of our customers want that from us than we think ? Perhaps they are coming into our stations making demands and spouting off their needs but in reality they are crying out for a shoulder to cry on . Okay , probably not . More than likely , that woman who yelled at me last week about her burger being overcooked was in fact just a true bitch and not reaching out for kindness . Maybe she needed a lesson in gratitude and to be reminded to be thankful for the " shitty stuff " or in her case , a medium-well burger instead of a medium-rare one . <p> My point is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers with the assumption that they are dependent on kindness to get them through their day . Maybe our job is more than carrying food to someone . Could it be that our job is to make sure people leave our station in a better mood than they were in when they got there ? Could it be that I am waxing poetic simply because I chose to have two mimosas for breakfast this morning and my fingers are typing drunk words ? Either way , I suppose that kindness is something we should aspire to have and give . <p> But back to the woman who wrote the note : Isnt is nice of her that on the very first day she has been diagnosed with cancer , rather than wallowing in her own misery , she made the decision to immediately start teaching others how to take full advantage of the life they have ? I wish all good things for this mystery diner . I hope she makes a full recovery and that she has plenty of time to blare Prince all she wants . And thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that sometimes our customers need more than spinach dip or a bottle of Merlot . Sometimes they just need a friendly smile and a thoughtful hello . We can do that , cant we ? 109839 @qwx969839 <p> Time for another installment of Dear Bitchy , also known as " I Do n't  Know What the Fuck to Write About Today . " Please email me at The Bitchy Waiter if you have a question that needs attention . Or email me to say hello . That 's nice too.Dear BW , I have a situation and could use some advice . I recently started a new job where I 'm at least ten years older than everyone including my manager . For the first time ever I 'm not using my restaurant job as a social outlet . I just do n't  have much in common with anyone else there . I like everyone I work with . I just do n't  engage much in their small talk or gossip . Yesterday my manager pulled me aside to ask if I was ok . She said everyone was worried that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work . She said I was doing a fantastic job but everyone thought I was stand offish . What should I do ? <p> signed , Juliet <p> Dear Juliet , <p> Please set your glass of Metamucil down , turn up your hearing aid and listen to this . Okay , you wont be listening to this advice so turn your hearing aid back down and put your bifocals on and read ahead , lady . I know your problem well because I too am the " old one " at one of my jobs . Luckily for me , I have two jobs and at the other one there are people who are even older than me ( Hi , Tom ! Hi , Eddie ! ) At the job where I am looked at as the senior , I too tend to not chat a lot with some of the people I work with . I want to talk about The Smiths and they want to talk about Lady Gaga . I like Bewitched while they like Jersey Shore . The gap in age is considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( That was a cheap shot , but I get a kick out of knowing that Springs1 gets a Google alert about herself and then comes here to write a comment and I shut her ass down . ) <p> I embrace the age difference . I commend you for making the conscious decision to set yourself apart from the social dramas that tend to happen at restaurants . As for their small talk and gossip , who cares ? If they want to imagine that you have this miserable home life which must be why you choose to not talk to them about who is sleeping with whom and how drunk they all got the night before after closing , let them think it . You do n't  go to your job to engage in that shit , you go to your job to do it well and make your money . <p> One bit of advice though : it may be helpful to play the social game at least a little bit so that if the time comes for you to need to switch shifts with someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help you . Its okay if they think you do n't  socialize so much but you do n't  want them to think you are so " stand offish " that you 're a bitch . <p> One final option is to get a job serving in a retirement home so you can surround yourself with elders and you can be the young one again . That way you can talk about how much you love the newest hit singles by Sheena Easton and Dexys Midnight Runners and they will all think you are so cool and hip on the music scene because they only know Benny Goodman and Dinah Shore . The tips may not be so great at a place like that ( buffalo nickels and hard candies ) but fooling yourself into thinking you 're young again can do wonders for ones psyche . <p> Bottom line : do n't  worry if they think you 're no fun . One of the benefits of growing older is recognizing that what other people think about us does n't  matter . Just scream at them to get off of your lawn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love , Bitchy Waiter 109839 @qwx969839 <p> Like the lure of the Sirens that drew sailors towards the shore of their rocky island coast , so goes the lone dirty table in the restaurant crying out to the customer to " sit here , sit here . " It matters not how many clean tables may be in the restaurant , for if there is but one table that has not been wiped down and set with silverware , that is the one the customer will want to seat themselves at . <p> One of the restaurants I work in is very small with only fourteen tables . On a particularly slow night recently , we have one table occupied with one table that is dirty because the two-top had just left . This leaves twelve tables that are blissfully clean with glasses , silverware and napkins . At precisely that moment , another two-top comes in and stands at the front of the restaurant waiting to be seated . I am standing behind the bar washing my hands . <p> " Hi folks , how are you tonight ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod their heads which I take to mean " We are doing fine , thank you for asking . How are you ? And yes , we would like a table for two . " <p> " Sit anywhere you like and I will be right there with menus and water . " <p> They again nod their heads which I take to mean " Thank you very much for acknowledging us , you 're very kind and your hair is really pretty . " <p> I watch them as they walk towards the dining room . They pass the one booth in the restaurant that has people at it . They then pass the second booth that is perfectly ready to have people sit at it . Then they approach the third booth that has two dirty napkins on it and some spilled water along with a few crumbs . They sit there . <p> What is it about that table makes them want to sit at it ? The booth right next to it is identical and then there are two other booths in the back of the restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can sit down at , but they choose the one table that practically has a sign on it that says " Do Not Sit Here . " <p> Is there a big golden magnet underneath the table that pulls these people to it ? Is that table emitting some silent song like those of the Sirens that customers find so lovely that they have to get as close to it as possible ? Do they do it on purpose just so they can get a birds-eye view of their waiter cleaning a table . <p> I grab my spray bottle and a paper towel and head over to the dirty table . <p> " Let me wipe this down for you folks since it looks like its still dirty from the last customer . " <p> I ball up the napkins and spray the table with soapy water . I wipe it down being careful to not let the crumbs fall into the laps of the customers . <p> " I 'll be right back with silverware and glasses , folks . " <p> They nod which I take to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess we werent paying attention but thank you for not making us feel uncomfortable . " <p> I return to set the table . <p> " Now , I 'll be right back with those menus I promised you . " <p> The rest of our time together went as usual . Was it a big deal that they sat at the one dirty table ? No , it was n't that big of a deal but I find it incredibly irritating that people will sit at the one goddamn dirty table in the whole restaurant and not think twice about . Note to those who are seating themselves in restaurants : if you see a bunch of tables that are set with silverware and glasses and you see one that is dirty , do n't  sit at the dirty table . We do n't  like that . 109839 @qwx969839 <p> Someone recently sent me a photo of a note that was left by a customer on the back of their restaurant receipt . It reads : <p> I apologize because you are a very good server but the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  so much as comp one drink is pretty fucking ridiculous . I live down the street and actually kind of like this joint but expect a scathing Yelp review and do n't  expect to see us here ever again . Peace . <p> Let us dissect this stupid-ass note , shall we ? First off , I commend the grammar . Most of the time when people leave notes like this , be it on a restaurant receipt or on a blog , the grammar is atrocious , the spelling is horrible and the syntax is worse . This is pretty good , I must admit . Other than that though , this is one fucked up piece of shit . <p> If he lives nearby and " actually kind of " likes this place , who is he hurting by vowing to never come back ? He s going to subject himself to visiting another joint that is further away that he does not like as much ? What a dumb-ass . Does he think that threatening to never come back is going to upset the waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy again ? And to threaten to write a " scathing Yelp review " sounds like something ten-year old would tell his brother when he wont stop farting on him . ( I do n't  know what that sentence means . ) Why does he expect free drinks because the kitchen fucked up ? Granted , it would have been nice of the server to comp something , but its not a requirement , especially if the order was corrected . Why are people so freaking entitled when they come into a restaurant ? <p> If you go to The Gap and try on a pair of jeans only to realize that the jeans say 28+30 but they are far too tight and they must be mislabeled because you know you are a size 28 and there is no other possible explanation of why the jeans do n't  fit , do you expect to get a free pair of socks out of the deal ? No , you do n't  . <p> Say you go to a grocery and you pick up some Pillsbury biscuits in a can . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the biscuits expired the day before . Of course you decide you do n't  want any tainted biscuits so you tell the check-out girl you 'll be right back and a minute later you return with biscuits that are good for two more weeks . Do you tell her you will never come back unless they give you a jar of free grape jelly ? No , you do n't  . <p> What about when you walk to the 7 train and you discover its not running because of necessary track work , a police investigation , train traffic ahead , a sick passenger or someone got pushed into the tracks ? Do you expect the MTA to reimburse you for your trouble ? Well , yes , we do expect that but it never happens so you suck it up and hope that your boss will accept " train troubles " as your excuse for the day because this time it is actually true . <p> The restaurant has become the place for customers to push back as hard as possible all for the sake of getting something for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be able to even eat in a restaurant and that they should be grateful for the experience . How many people in this world , not to mention our own country , cant afford to go out to eat ? Plenty . If you are reading this on your computer , or smart phone or iPad or tablet , you 're fortunate too . We live in a world of privilege and too many of us are forgetting how lucky we are to have some of the things we have . <p> A few days ago , I bought Apple TV . It was supposed to be so simple to install and of course it was n't . In the three hours on the phone with tech support , they had me click so many things on my computer that by the time I hung up with them I no longer had wi-fi in my apartment and was without Internet or Apple TV . I was furious . I was almost late to work because I was on the phone up until the minute I had to leave and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't shake the frustration and it was affecting my whole night . Within a couple of hours , I realized how silly I was being . <p> " Wait , " I thought . " I am pissed off because I ca n't stream Netflix to watch The Dick Van Dyke Show and I am unable to check my Facebook ? This is what is putting me in a bad mood ? Oh , my God , I am one of those people complaining about something that only very privileged people get to have in the first place . Chill the fuck out . " <p> And I did . The next day , my friend Randie walked me through how to get everything back up and running and I cant believe how upset I had been over the whole thing . My point is that maybe we should just take a second to look around and be grateful for what we have instead of focusing on the things that are not perfect . <p> Going back to the note , the kitchen staff may have fucked up his order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full belly and he shared his meal with someone he cares about . Why not be grateful for that , asshole ? So you did n't  get a free drink . You poor thing . All you got to do was spend your extra money on dinner out with friends where someone prepared your food , brought it to you and then cleaned up after you . How terrible for you . <p> Peace . <p> In the comments , name one thing you are grateful for . 109839 @qwx969839

I came upon a place on Spring street that promised natural and delicious foods but what really sealed the deal for me was the liquor licence that was displayed proudly over the bar .

Sipping it for the first time was unlike anything I have ever felt when having a cocktail . Ever . ( Well , not since a few days ago . I do love me some tequila . ) My tongue frolicked in the lovely libatious ( not a word , but should be ) liquid of hibiscus infused tequila . My taste buds bloomed as if the hibiscus flower itself had taken root in my mouth . I looked at Caitlin who by now was sporting the shimmering wings of an angel and plucking a harp with perfection . She was indeed my tequila angel and I fell madly in love with the cocktail .

She listed the ingredients and gave me the bottle of Gran Centenario Roseangel hibiscus infused tequila to hold . Of course the word " angel " was on its label , for how could it not be ? For this truly was a gift from God . I cradled the bottle to my chest and whispered to it that soon it would be living in my house . I handed the bottle back to Caitlin and thanked her for bestowing this gift upon me . <p> Before I left , I told Caitlin that I would be writing about her .

Then one day it was filled in and covered with concrete and the Apple Store came in and no one ever remembers that there is a fine dining establishment buried there . Sad really . This country does not care about its history and architecture . How can they just bury a place like Houlihans ? Anyhoo , I worked on that patio one summer and it was so freakin hot .

And I do n't  care what people say about it not being the heat but the humidity . If its 95- its fucking hot no matter what the humidity level is .

The second time I quit , I had really had it . I remember that it was a few before Christmas and I was sick to death of serving the dredge that had to come see The Radio City Christmas Ex-crap-aganza . Houlihans squeezed every drop of energy I had in my body and milked me dry . It was late at night probably around 1:00 AM or so , after we had closed and we were doing our sidework ready to get the fuck out . Our assistant manager came out of the office to give us a vital piece of information that he had forgotten to tell us hours earlier : the carpets were being cleaned that night and we had to move all the tables and chairs off the carpet and into the bar area . And he just told us this now ? I wanted to strangle him . I wanted him to suffer a slow death . I wanted to force feed him a Houlihans chicken stir fry which may be the worst fate anyone would ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this camels bitchy ass back . That was something we should have been told hours before so we could start preparing . You know , as soon as a table was cleared drag it over to the bar so we would n't have to do all of them at once . There are no words to explain how pissed I was . I recall dragging chairs and throwing them with all my strength ( which is not very strong so its not as menacing at it seems ) down the bar and letting them crash into the wall and the floor . My manager told me to take it easy and I gave him a big look of " fuck you . " I had already done my money drop so there was really nothing keeping me there except for this carpet cleaning crap . After moving about four tables I decided I needed to leave . Christmas was days away and I really wanted that day off to go to mass and celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ our Heavenly savior . Either that or wake up and have mimosas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to compose my letter of resignation . I picked up a bev nap and did that very thing . <p> Dear Houlihans , Effective immediately , I quit . <p> I laid the napkin on the managers desk , punched out and went home . I assume the carpets got cleaned . Good thing they were worried about the carpets . Yeah , the carpets were the grossest thing in that place , sure . <p> As I was walking past Radio City Music Hall recently , I began to reminisce about my days at the good ol crappy ass Houlihans which was two blocks away from it . Sorry , I have been on a Houlihans kick lately , but I spent some time recently with a friend who worked there with me and we started talking about it . Memories that I have spent years trying to bury and forget came bubbling back to the surface and now they are regurgitated on this computer screen for you to read/ignore . Our business at the Huli was directly connected to what was happening at Radio City . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be overrun with parents schlepping their bratty ass kids to see that steaming pile of live entertainment . We had a copy of Radio Citys schedule in our office just to make sure we were prepared . But the big daddy of Radio City is The Christmas Extravaganza . And when that shit rolled into town , the restaurant would overflow with people who were dying to have an overpriced hamburger and nachos served by waiters who hated them and everything they stood for . <p> If you have never had the chance to see the Christmas Extravaganza , be prepared to be hit over the head with the true meaning of Christmas . But only for the last ten minutes . The first hour and twenty minutes is about Santa and elves and presents and fun and then at the end they hit you up side your head with a Bible and bring Jesus all into he fray . They do about a thousand shows a day there , so we were always busy . I do n't  know why anyone wants to wait in line to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have waiting lists . When they would finally get to their table , they were always in a hurry and demanding attention right that second . It was the craziest place I have ever worked when Radio City was in full swing . I hated it . I mean I hated that place when it was slow , so imagine how I felt when half of middle America was in there . Crying happened a lot and I am not talking about the kids in my station . Bartenders cried . Servers cried . Sometimes we would just have to escape to the bathroom and cry for a minute because we were so slammed and we just had to get the frustration out . <p> The funniest thing I ever saw was this girl named Rhonda . I always liked her . She told me to call her one time to get directions for a party she was having . I was reaching for a pen and she just said , " Its easy to remember . 777-PORK . " I never had to look up her number again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and her tables were needing her . We all started looking around for her . She had a tendency to lose it sometimes and we were concerned . I found her . She was back near the bathroom and the pay phones in this little corner by the back door to the kitchen . She was on the floor in the fetal position rocking back and forth and crying . It was so sad . Rhonda had finally lost it . Not only was it the saddest thing I have ever seen , it was fucking hilarious . We took her checks from her and finished out her shift so she could compose herself . Houlihans took a a lot out of us . Its gone now . Its The Tropicana Tanning Zone now where all the waitresses are in bikinis or some shit . I did n't  think it would be possible to make that space any more of a miserable place to work , but they did . 
@@106055488 @1455488/ <h> Category Archives : Tyne Daly <p> Okay , last night was one crazy night up in that place . I was working the final show of a world renown singer who has a career that has spanned 60 freaking years . It was her final show last night so everyone and there grandma was trying to get a ticket to our small intimate venue that seats 121 people . We had reservations for 145 . So needless to say it , it was not pretty when we opened the doors . Lordy , lordy look who 's praying for forty . Forty no shows. , that is . But they all showed up as did about twenty other people . There were famous people all over the place ( Oh , hello Cybill Shepherd and Tyne Daly , how are you ? Hi Rex Reed and Lucie Arnez , you 're famous too . ) These celebs were squished in right next to Joe Blow at the same booth . <p> When we opened the doors , I got the shudders because there were people as far as the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand like it was the last helicopter out of Saigon . These people were desperate to see this show . My station was the one closet to the host stand so therefore the one that could grow the easiest . More and more tables came from downstairs and we just kept extending the row until the last table was right next to the bus tub and coffee maker . Seriously I told the folks there if they needed another ginger ale , just help themselves and if they saw we were out of coffee , could they please just make it for me . They thought I was funny . I was serious though . The two other servers were just as crazed as I was , but we made a conscious decision to just have a good time and go with it . We squeezed our way past the tables and carried drinks way over our heads and I managed to keep a smile on my face the whole time . Even though my station was effectively cut off by five standing room only people , a rolling cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a SUV of wheelchair , I persevered . When I could n't reach someone to personally hand them their Manhattan on the rocks , I just gave it to someone else and pointed at who it belonged to and let it makes its way down . When someone gave me the nod that they needed my attention , I filed it into my mental list of people to attend to right after the other 43 people who also needed something . At one point when the show was just starting and I still had at least fifteen people who needed drinks I started to get stressed . And then I remembered : I am a waiter . This is not life and death stuff here . If someone waits a little longer for his Irish coffee , he will not go into cardiac arrest . If the lady does not like the chocolate mousse cake , she will not sue me for damages . I am a waiter . It ai n't  no big thing . Three deep cleansing breaths later I plowed through the crowd with my second round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes stinks . <p> At the end of the night , we servers were commended on how wonderfully we were able to navigate through the throngs of people . It was seriously crowded up in there . Like I think some people became intimately familiar with one another because they were forced to be so close to each other . People were on chairs , stools , the floor , laps and each other . ( Fifty years from now : Grand kids , I met your grandma when we were at a show together that was so crowded , the only place there was to put my penis was inside her vagina . And that 's how how your dad was conceived . ) I went up to the singer after the show to tell her good bye and she gave me a hug and thanked me for doing such a good job . This woman is so cool . I really admire her and I think part of the reason I was so determined to deal with the craziness was because I respect her so much . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her show .

I was recently having a margarita in San Franciscos Golden Gate Park when I saw some total ineptitude happening right in my face . Thankfully , my face also had some salt on it from the rim of my glass so I was able to deal with what I witnessed . First off , I sat down at 3:45 and ordered my cocktail . Immediately afterwards , I saw the table tent that alerted me to the taco bar and drink special that started in a whopping fifteen minutes . At 4:00 , margaritas would be two for one .

Go tell someone that you need more rice . Okay ? <p> Wow , someone needs to run out and get a stone tablet because it sounds like we now have eleven commandments . We need a rewrite and reprint for the Bible . Call Confucius and tell him he s got a new saying for his next batch of fortune cookies .

There was a time when I was as pure as the driven snow and filled with hope and and inspiration to serve others . Of course , this was before I was an actual waiter . I was just a lowly busboy dreaming of the day that I could be a waiter and reap the rewards of that position . Behold : <p> September 30 , 1989 : Worked tonight and made $31 . Cool , eh ?

But we must take notice of my aspiration to become a waiter and how I truly wanted to be a great one . I was working at a Mexican restaurant in Denver called Juanitas . Who even knows if its still there ? But that place groomed me for my future in the food service industry . There was one waitress there who always said " pardon me " when ever she walked by and I always thought it was so sophisticated of her .

I did n't  want to freak the world out ( or at least that population of the world that watches the Today show ) by telling them that it happens all the time because we all know that it does n't  happen all the time . But it does happen . In a perfect world of horribleness when a horrible person treats their server horribly and that server is also a horrible person , spit may make its way into some food . I did it one time . One time only and although at the time I felt it was completely justified , - I soon realized it was not . Here is the post I wrote about that experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . -BW <p> One of the most common questions I am asked is if I have ever spit in anyones food . The answer is absolutely not .

That is unprofessional , immature , unsanitary and disgusting and I would never do that to a plate of food . But one time I did spit in a lemonade . <p> Although I am not proud of this fact , I admit that I stooped to that level . Blame it on youth , blame it on insensitivity or blame it on the rain , but it happened . Black Eyed Pea Highway 290 in Houston , Texas . I was working my regular lunch shift in the late 1970s .

They were not being particularly nice to me , but I could tell that they were not particularly nice to anyone else either . They were real men who thought that manners do n't  matter ( they do matter ! ) and the gruffer they were , the more manly they were . One guy kept sucking down lemonade because he wanted to make sure he took full advantage of the unlimited refills that were available . As I brought another glass to the table , I distinctly heard the word " faggot " followed by deep guttural manly men laughs . When I put the glass down , they all looked at me and abruptly stopped laughing . I knew they were laughing at me . They continued with their non-use of " please " or " thank you " and when it came time for yet another goddamn glass of lemonade , I had had it . Still fuming about the " faggot " remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular occurrence for me . Some people had nicknames like Skip , Moose , or Boss . Mine was Faggot . Suddenly those four men at table 14 represented every boy in high school who had called me that name . They were the same boys on the school bus who knocked me down and made me cry . They were the same asses who scrawled my name on the bathroom wall saying I gave good head . They were the same punks who slashed my tires at the Homecoming dance .

@@106055502 @1455502/ <h> Waiter Fired for a Walk-Out . Or Was He ? <p> Thank you to everyone who alerted me to a story that is going down in Myrtle Beach . According to a most excellent website called If You Ca n't Afford to Tip , a man was fired from his waiting job after a party of eleven walked on their check . Not only was he fired , he had to pay the tab . All together now : AWWWW , hell NO ! The only way this became known was because his wife wrote a Rant and Rave on Craigslist about the situation . You can see the original post here , but here is what it said : <p> " To the group of 11 people who walked out on their tab at Captain Benjamins on Labor Day .. my husband was your server that night and because of you he not only had to pay $400.00 for YOUR tab , he LOST HIS JOB because of this situation . We are a family doing everything we can to make ends meet . We have a one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you did not have the money to pay to eat at an all you can eat seafood buffet or had no intention on paying in the first place , stay home like most of us do . Someone has to pay for your actions that night and unfortunately it was my family with our BILL MONEY . I want everyone to realize , if you go eat in a restaurant and leave without paying , more often than not it is the server required to pay your bill . A server who does not make an hourly wage , who works for TIPS ONLY . We now have no income what so ever and you have put us in a horrible situation which I would n't wish on my worst enemy . The first of the month is always hard for us anyway as that 's when our rent is due and all of our utility bills . You have placed us in a situation where we have no way to pay those bills . That $400 was only part of our rent money and he would have made up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO GO TO because of YOU ! Someway , somehow we will make it through but I ask you and all other patrons at a restaurant to think twice about your actions as that was WRONG ! " <p> Craigslist <p> We can not know if this is true since Craigslist is not a reputable news agency or anything . I went to the Facebook Page of Captain Benjamin ( long lost brother of Capn Crunch and bastard child of Bluebeard and Moby Dick ) and there are lots of people huffing and puffing about the event but the restaurant has left a comment saying that everything is untrue . Their statement is full of bad grammar and all capital letters and for that reason alone , I want to think they are lying : <p> Perhaps this dining establishment is a theme restaurant where all the servers wear funny hats and clothes , for why else can you explain that they have " costumers " instead of " customers ? " And what did these poor costumers go thru , pray tell ? <p> Because giving away free food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This story is all over the place . For one thing , it is illegal to make a server pay for a walkout . Sure , they can fire you if it happens every other night and you 've been warned about it , but most restaurants are not going to do that if it happens very rarely . If they are , they should be reported to some labor board or something . Secondly , if the man was going to be fired why did he still pay the $400 ? If I was told I was being fired , I would whip off my apron , grab a beer out of the reach-in , pull the emergency slide exit and get my ass outta there . I certainly would not hand over $400 bucks first . And what server has that much money in their wallet anyway ? Do we think the guy wrote a check out to them in between signing his termination papers and saying good bye to the kitchen crew ? <p> I suppose it is possible that some disgruntled employee wrote the Craigslist post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much sidework . It does have the possibility of becoming a public relations nightmare for Captain Benjamin . I honestly do not know what to believe and I leave it up to you to decide who is telling the truth . Here is Captain Benjamins Facebook Pageif you want to go there and try to decipher the truth . And here is the the Facebook Page for Capn Crunch if you want to just forget about all this craziness and remember the good old days when you ate a bowl of sugar for breakfast . And when I say " good old days " I mean this morning . <p> Update : According to the commenter below , " I am lead server at this establishment . This story is a fabricated lie made up by an employee to his wife to cover his own job related dishonesty . The server did not have a group of 11 people walk out nor did he pay anything . He chose to leave this job on his own free will after being addressed about another situation . Sadly people are reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its managers without knowing the truth of the matter .

These establishments LEGALLY pay their employees $2.15/hr . They do anything they can get away with . The bartender at my previous job took a credit card to run a tab , then tried to run it after the guest just left . It was declined . " Surprise ! " He had to pay for the $150.00 tab ( $50/shift for the following three shifts ) or get fired for " mismanagement of money .

Better to claim you were unfairly fired rather than say you quit and also cleaned out the bank account to boot . <p> When I interviewed at a seafood buffet chain , the manager told me I 'd be responsible for any walkouts as well as being required to learn ridiculous daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room every hour regardless of what stage of dining our guests were in I laughed &amp; walked out of the interview ! <p> He s totally a crackhead . Either stole the money or did n't  show to work after a week sober cause the asshole got fucked up . Addicts are pretty convincing liars even saying some pretty of the wall shit like this . The wife wants to believe this rather than her husband lying and fucking up again . <p> Its illegal for an employer to fire you because of a walk out . Its also illegal for an employer to charge you for the lost revenue . Whether it be broken glasses , table walking out on their check , or dropping a drink/meal you can not charge your employee for it .

Thankfully , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bar , but I still feel the consequences since he wo n't close his check until long after closing time . I do n't  comprehend a few things in this situation . It truly baffles me that he has no issue nursing his drink for an hour after we close as we servers stand around with our arms crossed with nothing to do . What confuses me even more is why the manager/owner allows him to continue ordering drinks thirty of forty minutes after we close . " Well , we have to take care of our regulars , " he tells me . I get that , Mr. Owner , but I do n't  own this restaurant , you do . You are the one who has chosen to be at the restaurant six days a week from 10:30 AM until midnight . You have no life . Well , except for your wife and kids who I guess do n't  even know you . I , however , do have a life and it does not revolve around your restaurant . I work there part-time and cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of your regulars , do it , but I do n't  see why I have to stay at work for an hour after my last table has left and my sidework is done just so you can " take care " of this piece of shit . <p> Piece of Shit continued rambling on about nothing important . The bartender begrudgingly listened to him because he was simply trapped behind the bar . Piece of Shit takes that as interest when we all know its obligation . He then began talking about his trip to London that I do n't  think anyone asked about . He was one step away from pulling out a projector and giving us a freaking slide show . All I could think of was I wish that Big Ben was there and ring out that it was time for him to go the fuck home . I have never been to London , so I cant judge what he was saying , so I put it to you , readers . Piece of Shit said that London is the coldest place he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeps into your bones and the chill is impossible to get rid of . In fact , he told us that this is where the phrase " bone cold " came from . Really ? Londoners , is this true ? Do tell . He also said that every house in London is always cold , because none of then have good heating systems . I guess he went to every fucking house and checked this factoid out himself . He went on to say that the only place that is ever warm are the pubs and that is why people are always there . Really ? I had no idea that when I go to London , I will be perpetually cold unless I am sitting in a pub . " Oh yes , I could not shake the chill . It was in my bones . " I looked at his 350 pound frame and wondered when was the last time his bones felt anything at all other than excruciating exhaustion . <p> At 11:56 PM , almost an hour after we had closed , he finally paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperwork and I could get out of there . He left a $12 tip , so after we pooled and divided it up , four dollars of that was all mine . The bartender was stuck , but I was n't . Piece of Shit said goodbye to me as I left and I mumbled out a fond fuckwad farewell to his fat ass . Who knows how much longer he stayed . Last week he stayed until 12:45 AM , almost two hours after we closed . Manager/owner really needs to grow a pair and tell him he does n't  have to go home , but he ca n't stay there . Do people have no concept of anyone but themselves ? I really do n't  get it . And I really hate this guy . <p> How annoying ! Perhaps his house is really cold and that is why he and his inconsiderate ass are " always " at your place of business well past closing time . The owner definitely needs to grow some balls OR else let the staff leave at closing and then personally take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my roommate is from Britain and her dad was bragging to us until this week . Karma is a big one ! I ca n't believe that a person has that audacity . After all , you 're a restaurant , not a full-out just bar ! Maybe you should start making passive-aggressive signsSara <p> This is a powerplay . He is so important and fascinating that the whole place stays until HE decides it is closing time . I have a friend like this who would have bragged to me for months that the whole staff stayed and listened to his tales of war . The man is very insecure and an alcoholic . Remember , insecure people are very aggressive to try and prove their importance . New balls may be required . <p> Passive-aggressive does n't work with this type of person , trust me . My brother is quite similar . He 's never held a place up for an hour+ after closing , but he does love talking his face off and talking over other people and he just does n't get body language or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autistic , and people with autism are physically unable to interpret body language without trainingsomething about missing neurons at birth . Maybe this guy is the same . Either way , the only approach is to tell him to please get outfuckin ' now . <p> I spent time in London but in the summer , so I guess I ca n't say for sure myself . But I hear that their winters are mild compared to some American ones . The shit he 's saying about London sounds more Dickensian than realistic something people would expect to hear about it more than anything else.I feel bad for people like that because they would n't act that way unless they were completely clueless , but then again I 'm not being kept at work for an extra 2 hours because of him so I can muster up a tiny bit of pity from hundreds of miles away , I suppose . <p> I totally hate customers that do that think they can get away with that ! I am in retail mgmt and despise anyone who walks in close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn off the lights fifteen minutes after we close and tell themthat the registers shut down in 15 minutes and if they want to purchase they better do it fast . I am so over this mentality that the customer needs to have their ass kissed and can get away with anything <p> There is no excuse for letting him stay past the one drink ( bill for two minimum ) when he comes in so close to closing . He 's an alcoholic and needs a place to camp out . The bartender should tell him that he can only have the one drink , have to pay for two , because you 're closing in fifteen minutes and STATE LAW ( at least , in the states I 've lived in ) wo n't allow you to serve drinks after posted closing hours . They can come in and pull the owner 's liquor license in a heartbeat , right then and there . No rebuttal because you knew the rules when you applied for the license.The owner should be told he 's risking his neck for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets his drinks , just that he can because all the other restaurant/bar owners know the law and close their doors . That 's what " last call " is all about . Losing your license . <p> As a Londoner I can tell you that London is actually a few degrees warmer than the surrounding area because of a cuddly layer of smog that keeps it nice and warm . Also , this has been the hottest spring since records began in the 17th centuryAs for pubs , we do n't go there to keep warm , we go because as a nation we are naturally disposed to drinking inordinate amounts at extortionate prices . Nowt wrong with that . <p> Tonight at work the bartender kept the bar open for an extra hour for ONE customer , hoping for something good to come of it , and he tipped her NOTHING . So I guess $4 is better than nothing . She was frickin pissed . I am becoming more of a stickler to the rules because I realize that although many of them are stupid or annoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are too nice . <p> Wow , what an idiot . Got ta love generalisations ! I do not live in London , I live in a town about forty minutes away called Reading , but that guy sounds like the kinda guy who would say Italy is the same as Greece and both of them are run by the Mafia so I doubt he 'd care . Of course London is not always cold and damp . That 's like saying New York is always covered in snow . And the reason people stay in pubs so much is not because they have crap heating , it 's because your local is an awesome place to be ! Your guy talks shit . If I was anything like him , I 'd assume all Americans were the same . Thankfully , I am not judgemental and I have been following this for ages and so know different.Keep up the good work , Bitchy = <p> Well , if he was walking around at 2am in January or February then he would have been damned cold but no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sometimes ) fantastic summers and quite incredibly we have something called central heating which every house , flat , apartment etc has installed . God knows where he stayed , maybe in a shed ? 
@@106055525 @1455525/ <h> The Real Story of Why That Starbucks Employee Lost It <p> Maybe you heard about the Starbucks manager who totally lost it on her customer last week . Thank God for cell phone video , because the whole scene is all kinds of awesome . First off , I had no idea that times were so hard for Rosie Perez that she started picking up shifts at Starbucks . As if being on The View was n't bad enough , now she has to take orders for decaf fucking macchiatos all goddamn day . According to news reports , the customer wanted a cookie straw ( whatever the hell that is ) to go with her Frappuccinno and it all went downhill from there . <p> Of course we do n't know what went on before someone reached into their pocket for their iPhone and started recording . Since I am always willing to give the benefit of the doubt to the employee rather than the customer , I would like to hypothesize the events that transpired that caused Rosie Perez to flip her lid : <p> Customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really big hurry because I am super important and my needs supersede everyone else here . <p> Rosie Perez : Yes , miss . What can I get for you ? I will do it right away because we here at Starbucks care about all of our customers and want to make them as happy as poss- <p> Customer : Yeah , anyway . I 'm ready to order . <p> Rosie Perez : What would you like ? <p> Customer : Ummm , I du n no . I kinda want a Caramel Frappuccino but I 'm on a diet . How many calories are in that ? <p> Rosie Perez : There are 410 calories in that beverage with 140 of them from fat . <p> Customer : Oh my God ! Are you trying to make me fat ? That is horrible . Can you make it with skim milk and leave off the whipped cream and use less caramel ? Wait , maybe I want one of those Organic Ginger Limeade drinks . <p> Rosie Perez : Those are delicious and only have 120 calories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , I want a little bit of fat . Can you add some caramel and whipped cream to that drink ? I 'm in a hurry . <p> Rosie Perez : No , I am sorry . That beverage is bottled and I ca n't do that for you . <p> Customer : Figures that the one thing I want more than anything in the world is something you ca n't do for me . Typical . Ummm , okaylemme see . I just do n't know what I want . Maybe I 'll just get a decaf iced coffee with caramel , but can you blend that and then add whipped cream to it ? And also , I 'm in a huge hurry . I 'm very important . <p> Rosie Perez : Well , if I do that for you , it would basically be the Caramel Frappuccino and you said you did n't want that because of the calories . Is that what you 'd like ? <p> Customer : Excuse me , but did you just give me attitude ? <p> Rosie Perez : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to help you make a decision . Maybe you would like to take another minute to think about it and I can help one of the people who are behind you ? <p> Customer : No , I know what I want . I want a bottled water but can I get it with the cookie straw that comes with the Caramel Frappuccino ? And can you dip the cookie straw into the caramel and then put some whipped cream on it ? And I also want a cranberry orange scone , hold the cranberries and oranges and substitute caramel and whipped cream . And I 'm in a hurry . <p> Customer : What ? ? ? I have to pay for the cookie straw ? It comes with the Caramel Frappuccino . <p> Rosie Perez : Well , it does , but you are n't buying the Caramel Frappuccino , so I have to charge you for the cookie straw . $1.39 . <p> Customer : This is bullshit . There is no way this cookie straw is worth $1.39 . I will take this goddamn cookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me ? I am the customer . I am always right . And I am in a huge hurry because I am so important ! <p> At this point , this is when someone begins filming the incident and we all know what happened next . There are two sides to every story , people . And I choose to believe that my ( totally made up ) version of the story is exactly right . <p> We all get to the point , for whatever reason , where we almost snap , and some of us do . Unfortunately , when you 're in a service job where you have to pretend to be happy and pretend that you give two shits about what the customer wants all day long , and you happen to snap , you get fired . Most office type jobs do n't  require you to pretend to be happy 100% of the time . People forget how hard that can actually be . <p> On the one hand there have been many occasions when I have wanted to yell at ignorant or rude customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all as it is sometimes to hold the screams in .

In no other job outside of the restaurant industry have I been expected to attend a meeting that may or may not be on my day off . Of course , what other job have I had that is outside the restaurant , so how would I fucking know ? The most recent one I was forced to attend was in fact on my day off . Sure , we may get paid for it , but like I need that extra $5.00 for an hour long meeting . I 'd rather have my day off , thanks . The meetings are always the same . The owner or district manager or whoever the fuck else shows up to burp out some words of wisdom . This particular meeting was also attended by a silent partner who was anything but silent . Every time he piped in , I automatically dismissed his comments because he knows absolutely nothing about serving . Besides , his wardrobe looked like he raided the closet of Mr. Furley and how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire , challenge , correct and educate but really all they do is create a big " shut the fuck up " moment that happens collectively among the employees . These people show up and act like they know what is best even though they only show their faces once every four or five months Their ideas may look good on paper , but they need a healthy dose of reality . Unless you are in the restaurant every day , you really do n't  know how things work . Do I resent them ? Oh hell yes . <p> At the most recent mandatory meeting , I took notes because I wanted to make sure that I got all of their points down on paper in order to memorize them and make our establishment a better place . No not really . I took the notes so I could put them on this blog and people could see how utterly lame and pointless the meeting was . These are a few of the things that were deemed important enough for me to forfeit my day off and drag my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No shit . Anyone who has waited tables for more than a hot second knows this point . " A vodka/tonic , sir ? Is there any vodka in particular you would like ? Might I suggest Grey Goose , Kettle One or Any Other Way Expensive Brand ? " <p> No eating while on the clock . Yeah , right . Uh huh . Sure . You try working an eight hour shift with no break and see if you do n't  grab a handful of whatever you can get . <p> No drinking.Excuse me , how the hell do you expect me to deal with the bitch at table 18 if I do n't  have a hidden glass of PinotGrigio in a plastic cup ? <p> No cell phones at work.Now that is just dumb . Look , I 'm not going to be answering my phone whilst taking an order but I will have my cell phone with me . I need it .

I thought I was supposed to openly show my disdain for my guests . Thanks for pointing that one out . <p> Be upbeat . That 's why I need the plastic cup of Pinto Grigio . <p> Do your sidework . Again , this pearl of wisdom fell right off the Obvious Truck . <p> Respect one another and respect your managers.Now that is just fucking hilarious . <p> Yes , that was the extent of the meeting . Why they did n't  simply send us an email or text message , I 'll never know . Perhaps our silent partner wanted to show off his latest pant and jacket combo and felt that a mandatory meeting was the best way to do that . As for the information we were given , file them all under " no , duh " and call it a day . Here are a few more nuggets of wisdom I am surprised they did n't  mention to us . All equally obvious but just as important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Do not floss your teeth while standing at a table . Do this in the sidestand or the service bar . <p> Do not pour vodka on a guest and light them on fire no matter how tempting it is . <p> No pets allowed . <p> Be alive when you show up to work . <p> Clock in and out so we can pay you even though you do this for the love of it and not the money . <p> No smoking crack , shooting heroin or tripping on acid while on the clock . <p> When someone orders something , ring it in , and then bring it to them when its ready because we owners think you are so stupid that you may not understand your function as a server and we feel better if we point out the obvious . It makes us feel superior to you because we all have small penises and have to exhibit or machismo and authority every chance we get . <p> I hate the obligatory mandatory meetings in the restaurant world . Only once has the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Next time I go , I 'll just have to make sure my plastic cup of Pinto Grigio is full . <h> 13 thoughts on " Mandatory Restaurant Meetings : Useless " <p> Mandatory meeting yesterday at work for trainers . On my day off . " Attend , or lose your red ( trainer 's ) apron . " OOOOOOOOOOOO ! So scared , but an extra hour of minimum wage ( over a buck below my regular pay as a cashier ) , so okay.We had to make New Year 's Resolutions , because you know , New Fiscal Year . Cashiers and retail people came up with having a set way to actually train people since we never get more than a few hours with new hires before turning them loose on an unsuspecting clientele . Retail manager jumps in with , " We have a whole booklet on that ; they are in the back ! " She rushes off and brings back a seven page package of What You Should Cover ( of 97 Transactions ) in a Three Hour Encounter with Someone Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been at this restaurant for five years , been a trainer for four years , and this is the first time I 've ever seen this ? ( None of the other trainers have seen it , either , but I 've been there longest so it only makes sense that someone would have helped me be a better trainer at some point , right ? ) Oh well.Servers that are trainers were told there are too many of them ( seven and we only need four ) , so some of them will go back to wearing the mud brown aprons and not be on training status anymore . Again with the " ooooooooooooooooo " , because a ) there was no pay raise with that red apron and b ) there will be no pay cut . Not to mention , c ) no one has to put up with trying to get 18 hours of training into a new hire with only 12 hours of working with them.Cashiers were told it is up to the retail manager if she keeps us . There are only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly afternoons and evenings . Both shifts covered . " If we are n't utilizing you , you wo n't be a trainer anymore . " So helloooooo ? Would n't it be good to schedule the new hires when the trainers are scheduled ? ( Especially on the days we are n't off ? ) Or at least vice versa ( snark ) . As it is , they have non-trainers with little experience on the job themselves training new people . Which only throws a monkey wrench into the whole thing.Result of the meeting ? I reminded my retail manager that my availability is far greater than what I 'm scheduled and I can work nights to help train new hires . If there 's no extra pay and no great bennies , why do I care ? It 's not because of the red apron ( which is actually more of a maroon and makes me look like a country-store ghost ) . It 's because I take pride in my job , and I want the new hires to do so , as well . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of bodies who can push buttons to plug into the schedule . I want job security ie , guests to come back so I want our team to be friendly , as mistake-free as we possibly can be , and consistent.Thankfully , we did n't have any talking heads yesterday and our new Training Coordinator has a clue about all of our jobs , not just the servers , so that helps . Still , I do n't like them on my day off , either . Especially since we have to show up in uniform . Because , yeah , who wants to get up , go out in uniform for an hour , and either go back home or bring a change of clothes to do anything else the rest of the day ? Bleah . Upside for you , though ? You got pizza and can hide Pinot Grigio in that cup of yours . = All we got was a country fried steak cut up into steak fingers and cheese fries . Oh , and all the free iced tea we can drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow ( yes , Saturday ) at 8am.I 'm sure everyone will show up bright eyed , bushy tailed , and NOT AT ALL HUNGOVER AND/OR STILL DRUNK.I do n't understand how people in charge of multimillion dollar operations can be so fucking stupid . <p> What I worked as a receptionist/vet assistant in a private animal hospital , we had monthly staff meetings that always ALWAYS took place on my day off . And yes , I was expected to show up for an hour to listen to the asshole head vet berate everybody for not doing his job for him . <p> I work at a hotel , and the manager is always coming back to housekeeping and calling for meetings WHEN WE SHOULD BE WORKING and tries to tell us how to housekeep . He is a fat old man who has never made a bed or cleaned a toilet in his whole life , what does he know ? Managers are full of hot air and just like to hear themselves talk . <p> My favorite employee meeting was one I attended after a coworkers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk , in costumes . Nothing was said about our lack if attentiveness , but there were no more meetings scheduled after a holiday.I also think the cell phone stuff is ridiculous . I think " what 's good for the goose , is good for the gander " . If there is no cell phones , then set the example as a manager . An employees life is no less important then a managers life , so sometimes we might need to communicate with the outside world . I 'm pretty sure high schools have better cell phone privalages than restaurants . <p> My favourite ever meeting was one where they set the meeting to take place before a wine tasting but forgot to tell the wine rep to come an hour later . Consequently , we had the wine tasting first but being total alcoholics , nobody was spitting out the wine . By the time the meeting started , we were all rolling drunk . I do n't remember what the meeting was about , though I assume it was pretty similar to the one in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't remember it clearly has n't had an impact on my work so maybe the fact that I 've had about 15years more experience than the 12 year old manager worked in my favour this time . <p> When I worked at the Big Box Music Store , we had mandatory Saturday morning meetings . I do n't recall any of them having any sort of point . I think they were meant to to pep us up or something , but it just made us all tired . I do remember there were always donuts , and often beer though . I do n't like donuts or beer though , so meh . <p> Ugh , hated those . Ours were always on Sunday nights , and I was an opener , so I invariably worked at 5 a.m. the next morning . So I 'd be sitting there sipping decaf tea and grumbling about how I was supposed to be in bed already , while some manager droned on the attendance policyeven though the worst violators never showed up to those meetings . <p> I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's done by conference call , so for me it 's just half an hour off the phones .

People come in there ready to drop some coins and I was happy to help them out . Its funny when you 're the new guy because you want to know all the answers to everything , but you just do n't  yet . When people ask me which is better , the lobster or the strip loin , do they really think that the restaurant let 's the servers sample that ? No . We get a shift meal of pasta and salad or tacos . So when I say that the lobster is so delicious because it has a subtle taste of the smoke from the wood in the oven , I am blowing said smoke up your ass .

He was president of some major company and owns about 1000 restaurants around the world and I am pretty sure none of them are called Pizza Hut or Applebees . <p> " Pardon me , but do you have a sommelier here ? " he asks me . " No sir , we do n't  , I 'm sorry . " He reminded me of a Grey Poupon commercial . " Can I help you ?

What would you recommend ? " My mind started to race . " Should I just pick a random bottle ? Which one ? The most expensive ? If its expensive it must be good . How do you pronounce that shit anyway ? Maybe my two nights in Sonoma wine country over the summer was enough to make me come up with an educated guess . Oh fuck. , I du n no . " Finally , I said to the man this : " Sir , I am going to be completely honest with you . I work mostly lunches . My wine knowledge is not what it should be . I could make up something so you would think I knew what I was doing , but I think you would rather me admit this to you . Would you let me find someone who can assist you the way you deserve to be ?

He sat up a little straighter and cleared his throat . " Young man ? " ( Brutally long pause . ) " I appreciate your honesty and integrity . Thank you for that . And yes , would you mind asking someone else to make a recommendation for me ? " I may be paraphrasing that last part , because honesty I got a little woozy when he called me young . I sent someone over who knows the wine menu backwards and forward and he helped the man choose the most perfect bottle of wine . <p> The gentleman left me a huge tip at the end of the night , presumably because I was an honest upstanding waiter who was willing to admit to his faults if it meant giving the customer better service . Or maybe he tipped me huge because he and his table polished off a couple bottles of wine and several Grey Goose martinis and he was too trashed to tell the difference between his bills in his wallet . Either way , he left happy and so did I. 109837 @qwx969837

I doubt he has to clean ketchup lids or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vatican and gets to ride around in that cool little Popemobile . He travels all over the world dispensing wisdom and spiritual guidance so its pretty much what I already do now . <p> As I mentioned , I did not grow up Catholic . I was raised a Southern Baptist where the fear of God was whipped into me by a preacher at the pulpit . Seeing that I am rather unfamiliar with what all the Pope has to do , I decided that a little research would be in order . I went to HowStuffWorks.com and found out everything I need to know about Popedom so I feel like I have a pretty good shot of at least getting an interview . <p> Assuming I get elected ( and why wouldnt I ? ) I learned that Cardinal Dean will ask me two questions . I do n't  know who Cardinal Dean is but he probably is just a figure-head who will accept any old answer . In any case , I am prepared : <p> Question : Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes ' " Cardinal Dean . Why do you think I even applied in the first place ? Duh . And how do you like your burger cooked ? <p> Question : By what name do you wish to be called ? <p> Answer : Patriarch of the West Papa Bitchy the Pope #sideofmustard <p> As for the duties that will befall upon me , I think I can handle them . I have often said that waiting tables prepares one for almost any job in the world and now is my chance to prove it . <p> Serves as bishop of the archdiocese of Rome , providing spiritual guidance to its members I got this . If it has the word " serves " in it , I 'm good . Next ! <p> Appoints bishops and cardinal I can do that . It would be just like choosing a shift leader . You want someone who knows a lot but maybe not the person who knows the most . Sometimes the person who knows the most is n't very nice to those who know less . <p> Presides at beatification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I wrote a paper once in junior high school about the Revolutionary War and I had a whole paragraph on cannons . No problem . <p> Spreads the word of the Roman Catholic Church through his travels If we change " Roman Catholic Church " to " Ways Customers Annoys Me " I am good to go on this one . I even have business cards that have my website on them.Writes documents that define the Catholic Churchs official position on issues facing the world Well , I like to write and as long as I have an Internet connection and Google , I can write about anything . Easy . <p> Confers with global leaders and politicians about these issues This would be a little out of my comfort zone because so far , the closest I have come to a global leader or politician is when I met Dr. Phil and when Gayle King tweeted me and she is one degree of separation from Oprah who is pretty much a deity herself . I also served Hillary Clinton a crab cake at a fundraiser once . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the Pope would be the new uniform . Gone are the days of all black polyester slip-resistance shoes . I could wear pretty frocks any day of the year instead of waiting until October 31st and those red shoes he wears are absolutely fabulous . <p> Another thing I know that the Pope does is give out the Holy Communion which is bread and wine , right ? I have totally done that like a thousand times . I can do this , yall ! " Real job " coming right up ! <p> If ( more like when ) I become Pope , I may have to let the blog slow done a little bit . I do n't  know how much time I will have to write , what with all the the movie premiers and church openings I will be expected to attend . Maybe I can start a new blog called The Bitchy Pope . I du n no , we shall see . I have not found the job application yet but I am sure it just takes some digging . The Vaticans website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is buried somewhere . That may be my first order of business once I start : update the website . <p> Wish me luck , everyone . And happy Ash Wednesday . Again , being very unfamiliar with Catholicism , I am not sure what it this day means . To me , it looks like a lot of people got too close to a candle they were blowing out . Do n't  worry though . When I am Pope , I will Google Ash Wednesday and make sure I understand it . I want to take my new career as seriously as possible . <p> Pacis erit vobiscum ! ( That means " peace be with you " in Latin . Duh. ) 109839 @qwx969839 
@@106055536 @1455536/ <h> Category Archives : coffee pot <p> Not a day go by it seems where there is n't a waiter or waitress in the news for something . Either a waiter is having his finger broken by a customer or a waitress is winning $104,000 on The Price Is Right . Today I see in the news that in the sleepy town of Beaufort , South Carolina a waitress was sent to jail for hitting a customer up against the side of her head with a coffee pot . The story goes that it was the overnight shift at the Waffle House and after waiting for 25 minutes to be served , a customer got into an argument with the waitress resulting in the head banging with said coffee pot . The police were called at 3:20 AM and they found what was believed to be marijuana in the waitress apron pocket . Wait , you mean a waitress who works the overnight shift at the fucking Waffle House in Beaufort , South Carolina has to be on drugs in order to get through that hot mess ? Color me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waitress did n't  hit the lady hard enough . She was arrested on charges of misdemeanor assault and battery and possession of marijuana and then released on her own recognizance . To top it all off , she probably had to go back to the fucking Waffle House and finish her sidework which consisted of filling the syrups , stocking the butters and mopping the floor . <p> This story makes me sad . As usual , I was n't there , but of course I side with the waitress . I imagine that the customer was some tired old hag who was siting in the smoking section and had been nursing her black coffee since she got off her cashier shift at the Piggly Wiggly down the street . ( Okay , just so you know , I totally made up that there was a Piggly Wiggly down the street but a quick Google map search shows that there really is one ! Ah , the south . ) <p> The customer probably ordered the chocolate chip pancakes with toffee syrup and whipped cream and soon started screaming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her food . The waitress looked at the computer and saw it had only been eight minutes and when she told the customer it had n't  really been " forever , " the customer got all whiny and bitchy and called the waitress a name insulting her position as head waitress of the overnight shift at Waffle House . You know , because in the world of Beaufort , South Carolina a cashier at Piggly Wiggly is way above a waitress at Waffle House but still far below the position of stock manager at the Walmart Super Center which is also right down the street in the opposite direction of Piggly Wiggly . ( Seriously , I Googled that too . ) Our waitress , who may or may not have been buzzed on A&amp;W Root Beer , sub-par bacon and marijuana , could n't take it anymore and popped that bitch in the head with one of those metal coffee pots and said , " Bitch your fucking pancakes will be ready when they 're ready , now shut the fuck up . " Again , I was not there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reading this and you are either the waitress or the customer , how youdoin ? ) <p> The whole story leaves us with a lot of questions : <p> Why did the cops feel the need to search the waitress apron ? <p> Did they have a search warrant or were they just looking for a pen to take notes with ? <p> Did the waitress get to keep her job ? <p> Did the customer ever get her chocolate chip pancakes ? <p> Who did the paper work and covered the floor after they carted the waitress ass away ? Surely there was n't more than one waitress on the floor at the Waffle House at 3:20 AM.

Who the hell eats that shit ? We all know they 're there in order to make the customer get thirsty and order another drink , right ? Its pretty smart actually .

@@106055545 @1455545/ <h> Man Bites Off Waiters Finger <p> I am sure there is a list out there that details the worlds most dangerous jobs . Surely at the top of that list are jobs like firefighter , oil rig worker , coal miner and Wal-Mart greeter but it is doubtful that we will ever see waiter listed there among those who risk life and limb for employment . Well , there may be a waiter in Serbia who thinks it should be on the list . You can read the real story here . Last week , a customer was so upset with this server that he felt the need to bite off part of his fucking finger . Apparently , the customer was an Australian national who was carrying in his own bottle of liquor to the restaurant and when the server told him he needed to put the bottle away , the man was not pleased . <p> Waiter : I 'm sorry sorry , I need you to put the bottle away seeing that its against the law to bring in your own liquor to a restaurant here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloke with some bickies to spend and I 'm looking for a billabong.Waiter : Yeah , I du n no what you 're saying . Just put the bottle away.Customer : I do n't  want to have a blue with you , I just want my drink . Do n't  make me have a dummyspit and shove a didgeridoo up your bum.Waiter : Put it away.Customer : I just want to enjoy my grog.Waiter : Put it away , please.Customer : Listen , hoon . Do n't  piss me off . You might think me an ocker but I 'm a Queenslander and I 'm also a real screamer so you might want to back off.Waiter : If you do n't  put it away , I will remove it for you.Customer : Aveago at it , mate , but I warn ya , Im about to go all Aussie croc on ya and chomp off your digits like theys a vegemite sandwich.Waiter : I cant understand what the fuck you 're saying , sir.Customer : Well , throw a shrimp on the barbie , I tell ya and then light me a durry because to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galah.Waiter : What the hell ? The two went back and forth like this using typical Australian slang that can be picked up from the Internet until one thing led to another and the customer finally bit off a finger of the server . The man was arrested but what about the server who now has to spend the rest of his life with a missing finger ? The whole scenario brings several questions to mind : <p> How is this waiter going to stick his finger into a cup of coffee to make sure its hot enough ? <p> What will he use to pick his nose before putting together a bread basket ? <p> How will he be able to point at customers to confirm their orders ? <p> Can he still hold a pen to write orders down ? <p> What if it was his middle finger ? How will he flip the bird to assholes who leave him 5% tips ? <p> What is he going to use to scrape off dried mustard from a fork ? <p> Without a finger , how will he text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidestand ? <p> Will he get a 10% discount on his future manicures ? <p> Do they have 1-800-SUE-THEM in Serbia ? <p> Will he still be able to twirl his tray around on his index finger if he only has the tip of it left ? <p> The next time a girl tells him , " just the tip , " will it bring back a flood of emotional distress memories ? <p> Since this news story happened in another country on the other side if the world , I will probably never hear an update on the story . Rest assured , there is a Australian man sitting in a Serbian jail cell somewhere with the taste of waiter finger in his mouth and if that waiter is like most waiters , the finger tasted like " I 'll wash my hands after work .

If you 're going to take away an Aussies alcohol , do n't  waste time discussing it and trying to understand the hilarious slang.assume that what he is saying is " Bring me more alcohol right now before I go feral and eat your finger " Let this be a lesson to you , we love a drink , if there is not one present at all times , there may be consequences . <p> Not to get all technical on your ass , but its darn hard to bite off somebodys finger . It would be like chomping through a raw chicken leg ( taste-wise too , as you conveniently point out ) , and snapping the uncooked bone with your teeth . What did this Aussie have , bionic jaws or something ?

I understand that sometimes people may not understand everything on the menu or perhaps there is an ingredient that may be unfamiliar , but when I was told this , I had to question if the customer was either a four-year old child , new to this country or just plain stupid . The question : <p> " This chips and salsawhat is salsa ? " <p> What is salsa ? Salsa ? Has this person never come out from the rock that she must be living under ? How does someone not know what salsa is ? I guess if it had just said " salsa " on the menu without the prerequisite " chips " it could possibly throw someone off , but I think " chips and salsa " is pretty clear . I suppose my co-worker answered with some vague description like " its a tomato based dip with chunks of fresh tomatoes and cilantro and peppers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does one even describe salsa ?

ME : There are a fair amount of chips , but way more salsa . I highly recommend it , but it might be better if you order it from Tom . He s better at the dance and the costume fits him quite nicely .

I finally managed to get her to tell me what she had expected when she ordered and she said , " I thought you would replace the bacon with a beef paddy . " I asked if she had requested a substitute when she ordered and she said , " No , but what kind of moron would order just tomato and Lettuce ? " Ummmm , apparently your kind of moron lady . <p> I have always helped my parents at their Thai restaurant .

That one has spot lights on it . We also have " Thai food " in huge letters on the window . And of course the menu also says " Thai " as well . Yet somehow people come in after staking at the signs/menu and asking me " What kind of food do yall have ? " . Or they ask if were an Indian or Vietnamese restaurant <p> I had a customer once ask me what ricotta is , which to some extent I can see how you might not know that if you do n't  have much of a sophisticated palette , but then she proceeded to ask me what veal was <p> I worked in a chicken fast food establishment that has drive thru . I had a guest drive thru and ask , , " Do you serve cheeseburgers ? " I replied , " No we only serve chicken . " The next question , " So what about hamburgers ?

@@106055549 @1455549/ <h> Category Archives : douche bag <p> At the club I work , there is a two-drink minimum . That 's just how it is at certain music venues in New York City and ours is no different . We tell the customer when they make the reservation , the hostess tells them when they arrive , its written on their seating pass and I tell them again when I take their order . It should be pretty clear . I can tell Table 31 is going to be a problem just by the way he does n't  want to sit where we have seated him . When a customer gets to the club two minutes before showtime , their seat might not be good as someone who arrived at the recommended 30 minutes before showtime . As I take the drink order for him and his friend , I remind them that at some point during the show they can let me know if they want another round or something else entirely . They order a coffee and a seltzer . <p> " And I guess we will just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since there is this two drink minimum thing . " <p> " Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . " <p> Throughout the show , I notice they are barely drinking their beverages . After passing by their table several times I decide that since they are n't  drinking alcohol I am going to let the two drink minimum slide . Five minutes later , Mr. Coffee wants my attention . I can tell he wants it by the way he is waving his arms overhead as if he is stranded on a desert island and he sees a plane flying overhead . I make eye contact with him and head across the room to see what he needs . He continues to wave his arms until I am within six inches of him . <p> " Another coffee , " he says as he holds up two fingers . <p> " Two coffees ? " I ask looking at his two fingers . <p> " No , just one ' " he tells me as he continues to wave two fingers at me . Maybe he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I add the second coffee to the check and when the show is over I give them their bill , which has two coffees , one seltzer but no cover charges because they are guests of the performer . Remember , I could have forced a fourth beverage or rang in a minimum charge but out of the goodness of my bloated black heart , I do not . <p> He gives me his credit card but then comes to find me a few minutes later to question his bill . <p> Why are there two coffees on here ? " <p> " Because you had two coffees . " <p> " Ca n't you count that as a refill ? " <p> " No , I have to ring in each coffee . " <p> Suddenly he gets desperate . <p> " I 'm begging ya , please . Please , my brother , I got a hundred dollar parking ticket today . I 'm in a rough spot . I 'm practically on the streets . Cmon , take one of the coffees off the check . " He points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his finger as if doing so will magically void them off . " Right there . " Tap , tap , tap . " Right there . Take it from $11 to $5.50 and then I 'll just pay you that in a tip instead . " <p> ( Yes , our coffee is $5.50 a cup . Why ? Because it is hand roasted by Peruvian children who grow each bean and take care of it as if its their own child . The coffee is brewed using water that comes from a glacier and we do n't  use just any old coffee filter . Our coffee filters are made by specially trained Black Widow spiders who weave them out of fibers of organic cotton that we grow in Central Park . We then serve the coffee in golden goblets from the Renaissance period that are on loan to us from the Metropolitan Art Museum . Naaa , not really . Its a New York City cabaret room . Shits expensive . ) <p> " Cmon , my brother . Take off one of the coffees and let me tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I can not understand how giving the $5.50 to me instead of the club is going to make his financial situation any better . <p> " I already swiped your card , sir , its done . " <p> " I 'm begging you man , I cant afford the three drinks . Take a coffee off and I 'll tip you real big . Cut me a deal . I 'm in a rough spot . I 'm practically living in my car . " <p> " I already did cut you a deal . We have a two-drink minimum so you guys should be paying for four drinks , but I only charged you for three . " <p> He finally relents and pays the check which has a grand total of $17.87 . He leaves me a $3.00 tip , which I am totally satisfied with . <p> " Thank you , my brother . You have a great night . " <p> I watch as he heads over to his friend the musician and they make plans to go out for a cocktail . <p> My thought is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are almost living on the streets or in your car because you cant afford rent , then maybe you shouldnt be going out to music venues to hear jazz . Maybe you shouldnt be making plans to go out for cocktails . Maybe you should sit your ass at home and eat some Ramen Noodles that you make in a hot pot . Or maybe you should go to McDonalds and lift some ketchup packets and mix them with hot water for some cheap-ass tomato soup . What you should not be doing is begging your server to give you free shit . Its pathetic . <p> The bartender hears the whole story . " Was he for real ? " he asks . " What a dick . " <p> " I know , right ? " I say . " But its cool . I did n't  know what I was going to blog about tomorrow but now I do . " <p> So , three douchebags walk into a bar . No , that 's not the opening line to a joke . Its what happened last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at place called 508 Gastropub . After a hard day of shopping and playing miniature golf , all I needed was a simple cocktail to soothe my nerves from the stressful situation that was happening at the golf course ; in front of me and behind me , there were children playing who had absolutely no respect for the sport of miniature golf . The kids were running from hole to hole and dropping their balls into water hazards . ( That whole sentence totally just reminded me of the summer between my sophomore and junior year in college . No , not because I was a big ol slut but because I was the manager at a Putt-Putt Golf . ) By the time I was at the bar , the Blood Orange martini was calling my name . <p> The lovely bartender whipped it up very quickly and placed it before me . I worshipped its beauty and then snapped a picture of it because my cell phone gallery is a sad but meaningful testament to my everlasting love of cocktails . <p> And then three guys walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud , not funny , loud , pretentious , loud and annoying . The one in the middle wore his sunglasses backwards in the very same manner that The King of all Tools , Guy Fieri does . I think when you go to Douchebag University , that must be the the first thing they teach you . I have never seen anyone but card-carrying douchebags wear them that way . Tool #1 says to the bartender , " Hey , its his birthday , " pointing to Tool #3 . Tool #2 was busy checking his Blackberry . <p> " Happy birthday , " said the bartender . Maybe she meant it , but it was clear that these asswipes were not going to get anything for free just because one of them happened to be born . Save that trick for Hooters or Friendlys . <p> They ordered two glasses of wine and one Old-Fashioned . It seemed like Tool #3 had just watched the season finale of Mad Men and wanted to be like Don Draper . I studied the behavior and dress of the three guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem so all-encompassing douchey . Maybe it was the Live Strong bracelet one was wearing or maybe it was the way one of them kept laughing way too loud at his own jokes and then looking around to see if anyone else thought he was funny as he thought he was . <p> They went on to order three dozen oysters . Knowing that oysters are an aphrodisiac , I imagined them sucking them down along with way too much to drink and then going back to one of their apartments to " watch a game " and then blaming the oysters and alcohol on the accidental blow jobs that happened . <p> Through the course of their conversation , I learned that at least one was a hedge fund manager . I do n't  know what that means exactly , but I am pretty sure it has something to do with removing errant hedgehogs from vaginas . Or maybe that 's a Christopher Durang play . He mentioned that his company wants him to move to Houston and he is seriously considering it . " Theyd pay me more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing place called Treasures . " I Googled Treasures and its precisely what I figured it would be ; a tacky upscale mens entertainment club . <p> " Please move to Houston , " I thought . " Right now . Or at least right after you convince your buddy that your penis would never ever fit into his asshole , but you 'll prove it if he wants you to . And if it does fit , then you 're alright with being wrong . " <p> They continued talking too loudly and getting on my nerves . I finished up my second martini and polished off the onion rings and paid my check . I walked up to the bartender and told her that I write this stupid blog . She was sufficiently unimpressed but I told her that I would be writing a story about the three guys at the end of the bar if shed like to check it out . I doubt she will . They probably tipped her well , because she was very pretty . They would have tipped her more though if she worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story and thank you for letting me take your picture even though I did n't  ask your permission .

This story came from someone who wishes to remain anonymous but I decided to share it exactly as she sent it to me because it is such a perfect explanation of what we servers so often go through at work. - -BW <p> This is the story of the Old Bitch and the Baked Potato . I work at a Cheddars Scratch Kitchen ( I 'd prefer not to disclose the location as there is only one location in the city that I live in and we can be fired for complaining about customers on social media . ) <p> Me : " Hi , welcome to Cheddars Scratch Kitchen , my name is- " <p> Old Bitch : " Water with lemon .

" <p> Old Bitch : " I specifically said no cheese on these baked potatoes ! " <p> The Old Bitch then proceeds to pick her baked potato up off of her plate and place it directly on the table ( which is disgusting because this means that I have to pick up her baked potato with my hands . ) <p> Me : " I 'm so sorry about that guys , I 'll bring a couple of new ones right out . " <p> Old Bitch mumbles under her breath about the offensive baked potato . A few minutes later I bring back two baked potatoes 86 the cheese . <p> Me : " Here yall go , I 'm so sorry about that guys . Is there anything else I can get for yall right now ?

Dentures cant feel temperature . I 've burnt my hands on a bowl of soup a guest was sending back to " put in the microwave , for me dear " 2 . Hearing aids do n't  always work , they may see your mouth move and put their own words in there .. 3 . Seasonings can kill , but that husband may want them anyway , therefore , he is n't allowed to order . ( Ive encountered this with my own head strong diabetic honey .. ) 4 . Refills are n't  always appreciated . This is n't necessarily aimed at this situation , but in a Ah-ha moment I realized , elderly people do n't  even want to look at a full glass of water , because it reminds them of how their own bladders do n't  work and they can go into actual panic attacks over getting to the restroom in time .

I 'm sure there are exceptions to every rule . I live for the day when I can be so old that I just do n't  give 2 shits anymore . Sometimes calling out said old people on their bullshit , is the only way to learn the reasoning behind it . And you might even just make a friend because of it . Some of my greatest friends are sarcastic bitchy old people , that can take it as well as dish it ! ) <p> And let 's not forget , its a generational thing , the older they are , the worse they tip . I 'm not trying to stereotype here , but its true from my personal experience . Old people leave horrible tips and I think its because they are uneducated about tipping . So , not only did the poor girl get hit by a cold spud , I 'm guessing she probably got a huge tip nearing approximately $2. #serverlife

The crowd was having a good time and it was rather fun since I did n't  have to whisper everything . When there is a singer , piano , bass , drums and brass , the atmosphere at work is decidedly more upbeat . When it came time to get round two of the cocktails out , I went over to booth number four and asked the man what hed like . Leaning into his booth , I said , " Sir , can I get you anything else right now ? " " What 's that ? " he said . I repeated my question with a bit more volume . He yelled into my ear , " What cheese do you have ? " <p> We sell a cheese plate that I can never remember what kind of cheeses are on it . Gouda , cheddar , brie , Velvetta , whiz ? I cant recall . No matter how many times I ask , it goes in one ear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no matter how hard you try , you just cant commit it to memory ? Its the same way I can never differentiate between the Q and the N train . Or prosciutto or pancetta . Or regular or decaf . You know , things that are pretty much the same but not quite . Rather than make up some random cheeses , I went to ask a co-worker . She was no help . " I 'm not sure . I just always say three non-stinky cheeses and that 's it . " Really ? People are satisfied with that ? Okay . Thanks . I was hesitant to ask my manager again because he would know that this is n't the first time I have had to ask and I have worked there for about 18 months . Clearly , there was no excuse for me to not know the three cheeses on the cheese plate . If I had to ask him again he may get the impression that I simply did n't  give a shit about the cheese plate . So I asked him again . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I have already forgotten . One of them was St. Andre , I know that . As soon as he told me , I ran to the table to regurgitate the cheeses before the names slipped out of my head and onto the floor . <p> " Sir , we have St. Andre , whatever the fuck it was and whatever else the fuck it was for cheese tonight . " <p> " What ? " he said . It was really loud in there that night . Neither one of us could hear shit . <p> " St. Andre , whadayacallit and thingamajig are our cheeses . Cheese ! " <p> He pulled his head back and wrinkled up his forehead . He acted like he did n't  know what the fuck I was telling him . " Did n't  you want to know what was on our cheese plate ?

He plopped his fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how he had to have two drinks while there and how helpful it would be to tell me both of them now so as not to interrupt him during the performance . " Do you gots Bud Light ? " Being new to the job and seeing that he had a list of beers in front of him , I paused and told him I was n't sure . I looked at the list and said , " No , sorry just Amstel Light and Sam Adams Light . " He informed me that he would have an Amstel Light . <p> " Alright , sir . And would you like that for your second drink as well ? " <p> " I du n no . " Long pause as he stared at me . " I 'll tell you what I do want though . Get the biggest glass you have .

" <p> I have now crossed the line from starting to hate this guy to actually hating this guy . I reiterated our food options and he finally agreed on the cheese plate and then berated me for not knowing the price without looking at the menu . He almost choked when I told him how expensive it was , but he ordered it . The table next to him told me " good luck " as I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also wanted a shot of Jack Daniels .

Got it , ass . Fine . <p> Halfway through the show he leaves his seat to come to the bar and complain that he is dissatisfied with his cheese plate . He was not paying for a plate of crackers with one piece of cheese . He would not be paying for it . Got it , fine . Meanwhile the other server went to retrieve said cheese plate and showed him several pieces of cheese that were still on it proving that it did have more than one piece as he claimed .

After the show , he walked around the room talking to some of his friends and ignoring me as I waited to accept payment . About fifteen minutes later I hear the other server calling after him as he walked toward the door . " Sir , are you going to pay your check ? ? " Asshole laughed . " Oh my Lord . I totally forgot about it . I 'm sorry . How much do I owe you ? Hardy harhar . " <p> I ran his credit card and you know what the asshole did ? On a $49 check , he left me ten bucks . I swear to God , I just do n't  get people . 109837 @qwx969837 <p> Have you ever been in a restaurant enjoying the company of good friends and savoring the taste of food that was made just for you when you are suddenly overcome with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depths of hell where the devil lives in a palace of rotten boiled eggs , cabbage and asparagus . If it seemed to come out of nowhere and then fade away just as quickly , there is a very good chance that your server just farted at your table . Every server has done it but few will admit to it . I freely admit that I will fart at any table that gets on my nerves . So basically what I am saying is that I fart at every table I serve . All of them . I had about 40 tables today so I farted at least 80 times because I always do it at least twice for each check . Some may call it passive aggressive while others will call it immature but really its just a basic human function when a reflex expels intestinal gas through the anus so get the fuck over it . If a table is being a supreme asshole than waiters will do what is known as a " Hippopotamus Fart " . This is when all the servers at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one at the same time and then walk away .

My kids , my mess <p> I understand the rules is rules thing , but good customers are good customers , too . <p> Instead of making this win/lose , how bout explaining the rules to the customer and apologizing for the inconvenience , all while backing the server . Then offer the kids ice creams on the house at the end of their meal ( or before if the parents want it that way ) . If the customer does n't  accept , then she 's out of luck , but she cant say the restaurant did n't  make an effort . Plus the restaurant is n't violating its rules . <p> Explain to me why any restaurant should offer free ice cream to a patron that shouldnt have brought it into the restaurant in the first place . You 're obviously confused as to what a " good customer " is . Regular does not equate to good . Kinda like a bowel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other food . Remember the Blue Bell epidemic . Ice cream can hold food Bourne illnesses just as well as a happy meal or anything else . How do you not know this , working in the food industry for as long as you say you did . Dumb ! <p> I do n't  know if its still the same , but years ago , the main reason we could n't let people into our place with outside food or let them put food in our fridge to keep a while , was a liability issue . If a customer were to become sick , it could be said that we either had a problem with our food or had done something to their food while it was in our fridge . Not worth the trouble . And as far as the ice cream , how hard is it to finish it outside , its not a 3 course meal for goodness sake . <p> Amen , brother . as usual the Yelper had to LET US IN on their life . " We were in town attending the ritual of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restaurant " Just more ME bullshit that this country is being weighted down in . Eat your bullshit ice cream OUTSIDE . How fucking hard would that be ? <p> Not only did Heather M. / Adrock have to go me me me ! She had to insert some BS story about her crotch droppings " performing " in some god-awful screeching choir crap . As if any of that had anything to do with the review . As if the experience at another local restaurant had any business in this particular " review . " And as if that wasnt enough , the narcissist had to send her own review to this blog for attention . Probably made all of it up , How dumb does she have to be to honestly think The Bitchy Waiter would take the customers side because a server would n't break a store policy , and possibly a local health department rule ? Heather M is truly mentally deranged , and was probably salivating at the expectation of peoples hearts breaking over her good for nothing childruns . Well , Adrock , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you inflict a little Munchausen by Proxy in order to get your attention fix . <p> First of all , I live part-time in Savannah , GA right on that same street , East Broughton . My family has a vacation home there and were regulars at both Leopolds ( ( so worth the wait for their awesome ice cream bliss ! ) ) and The District Cafe ( ( great coffee/beer selection , tasty sandwiches , very friendly and hospitable staff ) ) . These places are at the most , a block away from each other , maybe a few businesses between each otherDC is on the very end of the block that it shares with Leopolds , actually . And YES , District Cafe does indeed patiently deal with many , many messy ice-cream-eating morons overflowing from the often overcrowded Leopolds , idiots who find it perfectly acceptable to plop down right inside DC to eat their Leopolds ice cream in the air-conditioning or plop down at DCs tables . I 've seen these same idiots ( ( most often its tourists ) ) actually even request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand . <p> To be honest , I think the staff of DC has gone above and beyond being kind to these clueless jackholes and finally had to draw the line somewhere . For that alone , I 'll often grab a nice smoothie or a frosty beer at District Cafe if the line for Leopolds is just too staggeringly long ( ( which it often is ) ) . <p> I 'm with BW on this one too , especially having witnessed this customer entitlement at DC up close and regularly . Not only is it against most health codes but its just plain rude and trashy behavior to do that . You would n't drag your gross ice cream-licking kids to any other high-end cafe , boutique and restaurant , so why should District Cafe have to deal with the onslaught of rude visitors from the ice cream parlor next door ? <p> If this is supposed to be a jab at me , then you and Adrock are both guilty of not reading . I never looked up the location of the Ice Cream store , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yelp review , is that this herd of entitlemoos and crotch droppings were at the District and got run out , ice cream in hand . Then Yelper claims they left the District to go to Treylor Park , where they claim they were accommodated , and I pointed out that since this trip did not make sense , Yelper is a liar trying to shame the first restaurant by claiming the second accommodated her selfishness . Now if any of you want to continue lie and deny the juxtaposition of The District and Treylor Park , I can call each and confirm the addresses for you , pull up some Google street view , then you all can lie and deny about that . I swear , if you people would actually just read a whole post instead of just the first sentence , youd save yourselves a lot of fucking grief . Idiot Adrock and SSpencer I do n't  know about you yet . <p> i am a business owner too and , honestly , Yelp tries to bamboozle us into listing and advertising with them by putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They are horrible and those people who use Yelp to vent are ridiculous ! You only have to read posts from these 1-star people to know that they frequent and write about places like McDonalds and then complain that your food is overpriced or that you are n't  kid-friendly . HELLO ! ! ! ! Just an FYI at MY place you are n't  even allowed to smoke within 25 feet of my front door ! Its in my lease ! So , when someone sits outside , we have to tell them they ca n't smoke at an outside table . We also do n't  serve alcohol and regularly charge people a cork fee if they bring their own bottle . Hey , business is business and , as a business owner , my job is to make sure the MAJORITY is happy . When someone complains they are usually looking for something they are not entitled to or they want a free meal . My place has consistent 5-star reviews and the exception is always someone with unfounded complaints . Good for the management on this one ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my customers and my business ! <p> While I enjoy reading your posts I do n't  get the anger that so many servers seem to have . No one is forcing you to be a server . If it is your only option , then that is your fault for not taking the time to acquire a real skill . Your customers made an effort to do something worthwhile and as a result they have the resources to dine in your restaurant . You should appreciate the fact that they choose to give some of what they have earned to you . <p> CJ , I 'm going to excuse your comment as the ignorance of someone who has clearly not worked in the restaurant business . If you think juggling several tables , remembering orders , running food/drinks and clearing tables on a wicked busy night , at the same time dealing with sometimes rude and always demanding public is not a real skill I 'd like to know what is . You are obviously one of those " get a REAL job " types . Well , let me tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made as a server/bartender , and I was damn good at it because I loved the work . And , incidentally I do have a college education so I 'm perfectly qualified to make comparisons . <p> I 'm late to the party , I know . Funnily enough , back in my college days ( a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away ) a friend and I decided we were hungry and needed food ( i.e. , we were stoned ) except he wanted Wendys and I wanted Long John Silvers , which happened to be next door to one another . His car ( I did n't  have one ) was on its last leg , so we listened to the sound of the hole in the muffler for about a mile from our respective apartments , smoke from the cracked engine leaving that nuanced scent " We Are Poor College Students " on our clothing , first to the fish and chips and then to the hamburger joint . We did n't  dare attempt the car stalling out in the drive-thru lane ( embarrassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into each establishment together ( " Okay , it might not start , but at least we can eat in the car and nonchalantly walk home as if we have nothing to do with the vehicle " ) . At Wendys , our second stop , the manager waited on my friendand then asked what I wanted . I said , " Oh , I just got takeout at LJS . " He looked at me and said , " Bring it in here while its still hot . Do you need anything to drink . " I ordered an iced tea , brought my fish into Wendys , and had a nice little meal on an actual table ( neither my friend nor I had one at the time ) . I 'm not sure what the point of my story is except , maybe , for this : If one does n't  try to be a special little snowflake , one is often rewarded . " 
@@106055558 @1455558/ <h> Please Do n't  Beg to Your Waiter <p> At the club I work , there is a two-drink minimum . That 's just how it is at certain music venues in New York City and ours is no different . We tell the customer when they make the reservation , the hostess tells them when they arrive , its written on their seating pass and I tell them again when I take their order . It should be pretty clear . I can tell Table 31 is going to be a problem just by the way he does n't  want to sit where we have seated him . When a customer gets to the club two minutes before showtime , their seat might not be good as someone who arrived at the recommended 30 minutes before showtime . As I take the drink order for him and his friend , I remind them that at some point during the show they can let me know if they want another round or something else entirely . They order a coffee and a seltzer . <p> " And I guess we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order since there is this two drink minimum thing . " <p> " Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . " <p> Throughout the show , I notice they are barely drinking their beverages . After passing by their table several times I decide that since they are n't  drinking alcohol I am going to let the two drink minimum slide . Five minutes later , Mr. Coffee wants my attention . I can tell he wants it by the way he is waving his arms overhead as if he is stranded on a desert island and he sees a plane flying overhead . I make eye contact with him and head across the room to see what he needs . He continues to wave his arms until I am within six inches of him . <p> " Another coffee , " he says as he holds up two fingers . <p> " Two coffees ? " I ask looking at his two fingers . <p> " No , just one ' " he tells me as he continues to wave two fingers at me . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n no . <p> I add the second coffee to the check and when the show is over I give them their bill , which has two coffees , one seltzer but no cover charges because they are guests of the performer . Remember , I could have forced a fourth beverage or rang in a minimum charge but out of the goodness of my bloated black heart , I do not . <p> He gives me his credit card but then comes to find me a few minutes later to question his bill . <p> Why are there two coffees on here ? " <p> " Because you had two coffees . " <p> " Ca n't you count that as a refill ? " <p> " No , I have to ring in each coffee . " <p> Suddenly he gets desperate . <p> " I 'm begging ya , please . Please , my brother , I got a hundred dollar parking ticket today . I 'm in a rough spot . I 'm practically on the streets . Cmon , take one of the coffees off the check . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly with his finger as if doing so will magically void them off . " Right there . " Tap , tap , tap . " Right there . Take it from $11 to $5.50 and then I 'll just pay you that in a tip instead . " <p> ( Yes , our coffee is $5.50 a cup . Why ? Because it is hand roasted by Peruvian children who grow each bean and take care of it as if its their own child . The coffee is brewed using water that comes from a glacier and we do n't  use just any old coffee filter . Our coffee filters are made by specially trained Black Widow spiders who weave them out of fibers of organic cotton that we grow in Central Park . We then serve the coffee in golden goblets from the Renaissance period that are on loan to us from the Metropolitan Art Museum . Naaa , not really . Its a New York City cabaret room . Shits expensive . ) <p> " Cmon , my brother . Take off one of the coffees and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I can not understand how giving the $5.50 to me instead of the club is going to make his financial situation any better . <p> " I already swiped your card , sir , its done . " <p> " I 'm begging you man , I cant afford the three drinks . Take a coffee off and I 'll tip you real big . Cut me a deal . I 'm in a rough spot . I 'm practically living in my car . " <p> " I already did cut you a deal . We have a two-drink minimum so you guys should be paying for four drinks , but I only charged you for three . " <p> He finally relents and pays the check which has a grand total of $17.87 . He leaves me a $3.00 tip , which I am totally satisfied with . <p> " Thank you , my brother . You have a great night . " <p> I watch as he heads over to his friend the musician and they make plans to go out for a cocktail . <p> My thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you are almost living on the streets or in your car because you cant afford rent , then maybe you shouldnt be going out to music venues to hear jazz . Maybe you shouldnt be making plans to go out for cocktails . Maybe you should sit your ass at home and eat some Ramen Noodles that you make in a hot pot . Or maybe you should go to McDonalds and lift some ketchup packets and mix them with hot water for some cheap-ass tomato soup . What you should not be doing is begging your server to give you free shit . Its pathetic . <p> The bartender hears the whole story . " Was he for real ? " he asks . " What a dick . " <p> " I know , right ? " I say . " But its cool . I did n't  know what I was going to blog about tomorrow but now I do . " <p> I live in country where there are no free refills at all . You have two cups of coffee , you pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told , people ask for free refills now , " because that 's how they do it in the U.S. " . Probably mostly people who never ever left the country . <p> Oh , I love these people . Here , they just make you walk them through their bill or will start complaining about how awful things were even though they were great just one minute ago . Then , they will just take it out of your tip . I have come back to a table to tell them they short changed me , they took the money out of my already too small tip sitting on the table . Or , pay with a credit card , mark " 0 " in the tip line then hand me $3 on their $70 bill and say , " I wish I had more to give you ! " While I think , I wish my boss had told you to leave while we still had the chance ! <p> I 've had people beg me to void the 25 cents for extra dipping sauces . I mean really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner , give happy hour prices on apps 15 minutes after happy hour ends , and continue selling shots after people have reached the 2 shot maximum in our restaurant . Sorry . Our policies might be stupid in your eyes , but I 'm not risking my job for your ass . <p> Thank you . If there is ac lear policy in place , i will not be stepping out on a thin branch so you can save money on that second cup of coffee you obviously do n't  need or you would have enough cash to cover it . We do free coffee till 9 , do n't  show up ar 9:05 screaming about how you meant to be here by nine but the traffic blah blah , i meant to be married to amillionaire . And leaving on a tropical island , but i 'm not , so i do n't  expect anyone to cool me off with a palm tree leaf . 
@@106055559 @1455559/ <h> One Wet Purse <p> It was bound to happen . Any waiter , no matter how good or bad , is eventually going to see their tray get wrapped up in this crazy little thing called gravity and watch it come tumbling down . I try to never drop anything . After all , I 've tried for for three years , seems like thirty . Could you ask as much from any other man ? ( Bonus points to anyone who gets that musical theater reference . ) Wednesday night , my perfect record went down in flames . Well , it went down in liquid . <p> I am working at the club and the show has a pretty healthy audience . With it being winter and all , and people having this overwhelming need to stay warm , there are big black coats hanging on the back of every chair , making my confined space to walk even more confined . The words " complimentary coat check " are as meaningless to people as " please tip your server based on the amount before your Groupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags , the small space , the dim lights and the glass of Chardonnay I had earlier , it is near impossible to serve with ease . <p> My mood is already pretty miserable seeing that it is the night before Thanksgiving and all I want to be doing is sitting on my sofa having a wine tasting . I get to work at 5:15 in preparation for the 7:00 show and by 6:50 it seems that no one is coming . There are four people in the audience when it is decided at 7:15 that it will be canceled meaning I set up everything for absolutely no reason . The four people who did bother to drag their asses out to the club have their drinks comped and not one of them leaves me anything . Girl at table 23 , you were prepared to pay a $10 cover charge and then you ordered a $14.95 martini knowing you would still have to buy a second drink requirement and you still cant even leave me a fucking dollar when we apologize and buy your drink for you ? Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault that some dumb ass producer thought it was a good idea to book a show on the night before Thanksgiving . And her friend who was performing in the show ? He did n't  even show up . I now have two hours to kill where I am making no tips and only making $5.00 an hour . Grumpy ? Yeah , that 's me . There is an 11:30 show this night as well because you know that everyone wants to go see a show at 11:30 PM on Thanksgiving Eve . " Brine the turkey ? Fuck that , I 'm gon na go see a show ! " There are precisely zero reservations on the books but we are not allowed to cancel on the off chance that they have twenty or thirty walk-ins . <p> The 9:30 show begins without a hitch other than the multitude of black coats impeding my walking path . I trip on a black bag that is sitting in front of booth one and the lady moves it over about six inches . She does n't  move it in the direction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the booth , but she moves it so that I am still likely to trip on it , it will just happen six inches later than before she moved it . " That was close , " I think . <p> Ten minutes later , I am inching towards table 26 which is practically on the stage . I try very hard to be indiscreet so as not to bother the performer . I squat down with my tray of drinks and reach over to hand a martini to my customer . The vodka is safe . I remove an empty beer bottle from the table and place it on my tray . I then move my hand towards the glass of seltzer water as I also move closer to the customer . It is then that I feel under my feet the coat that will be my downfall . My foot catches on its sleeve knocking the beer bottle over and thus unbalancing my tray . The glass of seltzer tips over and spills on a purse . You know how quickly your brain works when something like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na fall over , no I 'm not gon na fall over but the beer bottle is gon na fall over , oh my god its gon na knock over the glass and its gon na spill , oh my god its spilling all into this really tacky cheap looking purse that looks like it came from Mervyns , oh my god , shes gon na be so pissed , oh my god , did I remember to set my DVR to catch Project Runway , oh my god , that purse is so wet and so ugly , oh my god at least it was n't a martini or juice because juice would be messy and vodka would be wasteful , oh my god , maybe she wont notice , oh my god she noticed , oh my god maybe I should n't have had that glass of wine , oh my god , what am I saying , of course I should have had that wine , oh fuck . <p> " I 'm so sorry , " I say . " Thankfully , it was just water . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I return with some napkins and blot up the spill and the show goes on . The woman is very understanding . If it would have been a screwdriver , maybe not so much , but seeing that it was just seltzer , she was alright with it . Let 's face it , she and I both knew that her purse needed to be hosed down with something , if not gasoline or soap and water , then at the very least , some seltzer . <p> At the end of the show , I again apologize and tell her that after three years ( seems like ninety ) this is the first time I have spilled anything . She seems unimpressed . I am very careful to not let her smell the Chardonnay on my breath as I tell her good night . Her tip is a good one because she probably realized that her purse is white again and not dishwater grey like it was when she arrived . The 11:30 show is canceled and I get to go home early after my shift drink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer intact , but thankfully my buzz is. 109838 @qwx969838 109836 @qwx969836 <h> 32 thoughts on " One Wet Purse " <p> I had a Woman and a husband sit down at a deuce . Instead of checking her long oversize coat she steals a chair from the neighboring table and piles her $400 Coach purse and coat on it . The entire time serving her she has to help me by taking and handing me things because I do n't have good access to the table with the extra chair there . At the end of the meal she makes the leaning tower Pisa of plates , cutlery and a hot drawn butter from her lobster dinner.As she hands it too me , the butter drops all over her coat and purse . Her husband starts to freak out repeating over and over how much the purse was . I loved it . <p> I was stiffed once by an 8-top for spilling a splash of water on a woman 's stretch pants . I had a hard time filling her water perfectly because her massive ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come from the Walmart across the street , so it was likely I only lost out on a few bucks anyways . <p> I was working the patio and the wind was blowing like hell , I spilled a tray of drinks at the table but mostly got it on myself . The customers were very gracious . I went through that frantic moment myself and by the time I found a manager to comp the round , worried about all the broken glass on the patio , and getting in the weeds because of the delay , I was full-on anxiety attack ! It cost me my job . " of course I smell like alcohol you motherfucker . I just spilled a whole tray of drinks on myself ! " Actually one of the best things to ever happen-getting out of that shithole . <p> I am so shocking with a tray . I have spilt an Irish coffee all over a woman 's lap once . Urgh was shaking so much I had to sit down for 5 mins ! More recently I spilt a tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady at a hen do . Luckily her blouse was a red and brown flowery thing and she was so drunk she found it hilarious . I handed the table over to someone else ! <p> Thankfully , all the drinks I 've spilled have been in the server alley . unfortunately , most of the trays of food I 've dropped have been in the dining room and that just hit the floor . The closest I came to getting food on a customer was an order of garlic toast that slid off the plate then table and into a fellas lap . I made a lame " new and improved flying garlic toast " joke and he laughed . Tipped me $5 or $6 . Customers with a sense of humor are the best . <p> That is , hands down , the funniest post I have ever read . " That purse is so wet and ugly " . I ca n't stop laughing . Only thing I ever spilled on a customer was when I was a busgirl . I was refilling someone 's coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those green patio tables that have wavy metal bars and little spaces . I overflowed the cup , and it went right through the table onto his legs . He was so angry . I did n't last long at that job . Really , it was the table 's fault for having holes in it ! <p> I tripped going up a couple steps and flung two huge pina coladas all over two ladies who had stopped in after playing tennis . They were really very nice about it and refused any sort of compensation . I had another server deliver the replacement drinks : - ) . <p> Ugh , I hate it when people do that , Becky . I have the worlds smallest hands . Seriously , freaky tiny hands . And skinny wrists . I am a mutant . So balancing a full tray of drinks on it is well , a balancing act . One I do quite well if no-one interferes . If someone tries to remove a drink for me it ruins the whole equilibrium and I risk spilling drinks everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my tray , bumping the tray badly as he did it , ( he could n't wait the extra 5 seconds to start slurping down his apple juice or whatever ) and it upset the whole thing . The kid ended up with a whole bottle of beer down the front of his shirt . It took a lot of effort to pretend I actually cared . <p> Luckily ive only spilled onto the table .. but i also only one hand carry a tray with cups no hot beverages , beer bottles or wine glasses.i have very unsteady hands . I have however been spilled on as a customer , it was just water but the poor girl was so upset . I felt so bad for her.hopefully she understood that i was not upset at all . <p> During my brief career as a server years ago , I tripped over a metal pole , it was holding up the parasol or something I think and hiding between all the tables . I was holding a tray full of drinks and was n't really watching my feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spilling beer all over a lady 's coat . My knee was also bleeding , I was so startled . The people were incredibly rude about it as well . Some people have no sympathy . It was just a summer coat , easily washed , not exactly a huge deal . <p> My boss spilled a drink at a table of regular businessmenof course it had to be the guy who is always starched and pressed to a " T " . Fortunately the restaurant is owned by women and there was a blow dryer in the office .. which is where this customer was rushed off to . We had a running joke with this table about coming in for lunch and a blow job = <p> So last night in the large party section ( upstairs . lots of stairs ) I got a ten , a twelve , and a group that claimed they were 15 , all being sat within ten or fifteen minutes of eachother . The first two parties ordered pre-dinner drinks and aps , and the purported 15 were at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their table ( hereafter referred to as 303 or Hell ) . We made some jokes , chatted about beer , determined that they would not be dining and all needed individual checks . A few more showed up , also nice guys , jokey guys , funny guys . Maybe 12 people total . Then , I watched in horror as 23 people joined them . I was calm , rational , terrified . Managed it ok for about an hour or so , right about the time the ten asks for their check . Busy splitting the check up , I had a tray of drinks waiting downstairs for 303 . My GM brought it up . I asked him to please please please just set it down . He will do no such thing.He has some insane need to " help " . I drop what I 'm doing to run the drinks ( which for whatever reason must not be allowed to sit for a single second ) . He still tries to help . I 'm wading through the milling group of hipster thirtysomethings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the group since he placed his order , calling " Yeti ! Yeti ! Where did you go ? " ( He had ordered a Yeti by Great Divide- fantastic beer ) I finally caught the guy 's eye , go to pick up the glass off the tray , and my GM grabs it first . The tray and remaining 3 beers &amp; a Jameson &amp; ginger go all over me . And the girl sitting beneath my tray . And the cute couple next to her . But mostly me . My GM says " I was just trying to help " and I run for napkins &amp; towels . I make sure she 's good . I replace the drinks . I try to take a moment to clean myself up , but one of the ( now 40 ) guys from 303 follows me and taps me on the shoulder . He needs a bud light . I say " give me a second , I just got beer all over me , " and he says " I know , I wass standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't get it on me ! " DOUCHE . <p> let 's see.the worst spill/drop i ever saw was a server drop a birthday cake on the way to the table that the table had brought in . My worst spill was more of a spray . I was bar tending a Saturday night and we had a trainee that of course broke glass over the ice well in the middle of the shift . Since this was of course going to happen at some point in his training I was cool and volunteered to help him burn the well . Well at the end of it all , I took the hose back to the end of the bar and started to wrap it back in place . I turned the water off and started to point the nozzle over the sink to get the remainder of the water out . Somehow , I tapped the handle of the high power hose and a stream of water shot out over the bar into the dining room right onto the back and newly and crisply curled do of a guest.man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor laughing ! She was pissed of course but honestly the situation was so bizarre I personally would have laughed about it . Instead she demanded to have her whole bill taken care of and then left without tipping her server that had nothing to do with it . <p> One St. Paddys day , I tipped a beer off a tray and it fell neck down into the guys asscrack ! I literally pulled the bottle out of his pants . The two women with him were hysterical and refused to drive him home to change cuz they did n't  want to lose a table in my station . <p> Oh damn it , musical theater knowledge throwing me wrong answers . Gethsemane , Jesus Christ Superstar , and the idea that people have thinking it is ok to ditch your tip must come from that special little planet that breeders with no parenting skills are creating for the rest of us . <p> First day of the floor , I spilled cocktail sauce on a guests white pants ( they tried making me pay for a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chanel , would n't have been to cheap .. ) and then a week later I dropped a tray of 7 drinks . Thankfully nothing else has spilled since I started ! ! ! First serving job &gt;&lt; <p> I spilled red wine on a guys khakis once . It was one of my first serving jobs ( before I became numb and apathetic ) and I ran out back to the dumpsters to cry . I was terrified to face that table again . But they were actually pretty understanding probably because we bought their entire tables check and they left me a decent tip . <p> In 20 years , the only time I ever spilled anything on a guest was because my manager was not looking where she was going and crashed into me . It was 3 chocolate milks , and they were totally cool about it . <p> But , hands-down THE best spill story Ive ever heard came from a guest in my station a banquet server at another establishment . As she tells it , she was serving pasta at a function , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dish on her other arm tipped , and sent an entire order of pasta spilling directly ( and with amazing accuracy ) IN to a ladys purse which was sitting on the floor beside her chair ! Panic moment ensueduntil she realized that no one had noticed !

@@106055561 @1455561/ <h> Concord the Grape <p> A few weeks ago , I promised that the 2400th fan would get a blog post written about them . That fan was Grape Winebar and as promised , here it is . How the hell I am going to write a story about a freakin winebar , I du n no <p> Concord Grape was born on a cold September morning in Jacksonville , Florida . His vine was next to a pond that had a never ending stream of murky water being pumped into it from a big drainage pipe . From day one , his life was not easy . Most of his brothers and sisters on the vine did n't  survive the uncommonly cold weather that fall and those who did simply became breakfast for a few squirrels , some birds and a one-eyed waitress named Sally who lived under a bridge with her husband The Troll . As Concord grew older , he could see that his future was not bright and he longed for adventure . He looked at the road and wondered what was just beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured life of a raisinhood he hatched a plan to escape this dreadful vine that was holding him back from a lifetime of excitement . <p> One day , as Sally was foraging for her dinner alongside her cat Maisy ( who was named after a character in the musical The Boyfriend ) , Concord realized they could be his escape vehicles . If he could just loosen himself from his vine at the right moment , he could fall onto the fat back of Maisy and balance himself there as they left the field and he could say goodbye to the patch of boredom he had called home for so many days . ( The lifespan of a grape is very short . ) As Maisy moseyed underneath him , Concord used every drop of grape juice within him to release himself from the vine . At the precise moment , he felt his stem release its grip and he began to fall towards the fat cat . However , Maisy saw a mouse at the exact same time and darted away , but as luck would have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hem of Sallys dress where he settled in for the ride of his life . <p> Sally finished her foraging and then squatted down to relieve herself before heading onto her next chore for the day . She made her way to town where she needed to buy some cheese and bread and also refill her prescription for antibiotics to solve a nasty urinary tract infection that she could n't shake . At the local Bread and Cheese R Us , Concord saw a world he had never seen before . The store was filled with the aroma of day old bread and half eaten wheels of cheese . On a shelf he also spied a huge bowl of grapes that he had never seen before . He knew this is where he was supposed to be . He was no longer a country grape living on a vine . He was now a city grape a whole 100 yards from where he grew up . He was home ! As Sally reached up to find a loaf of bread that had the least amount of mold on it , Concord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rolled himself under the table and stayed there until Sally paid for her groceries and left . Little did Concord know , his adventure was just beginning . <p> Moments later a very old man came into the store to buy his supply of grapes to make his own wine for his family run wine bar . The owner of Bread and Cheese R Us saw the man coming and reached up to the shelf to hand him the grapes that had been set aside for him . Seeing Concord on the floor , he brushed him up with his hand and tossed him into the bowl with the other grapes . Concord was now on his way to his next adventure ! <p> The old man was named Mr. Applehead and he owned a wine bar that was very popular in Jacksonville . People from all over the land would go there just to sample the fine wine that Mr. Applehead could make . Concord soon found himself in a huge vat with thousands of other grapes . He began to make introductions to as many as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other side of the vat . Someone was stomping on all of his new found friends and murdering them one by one . What was this horrible place he had found himself in ? Why oh why was someone squishing his new friends ? Had he really traveled all this way only to meet a horrible death of squishing by bare feet ? Yes , he had . <p> Concords last thought was how he missed his vine in the country and how simple his life had been in the good ol days of that morning . As he watched a giant foot come towards him , he flashed back to fond memories with Sally and Maisy and how much fun it had been to watch his brothers and sister turn into raisins . As his insides came gushing out , he realized that he had been a fool to want more than he had on his simple vine . He had longed for adventure and instead ended up as a pile of mushy grape alongside thousands of other grapes he did n't  even know . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Concord was in a bottle of wine . There was n't much left of Concord as we knew him . He was no longer the round juicy grape that we knew and loved . He was now liquid amongst hundreds if not thousands of other grapes . He was also 12% alcohol and had a fruity yet earthy aftertaste . He was served to a very old lady at Mr. Appleheads wine bar who drank him with a plate of cheese and a cracker . She only left a ten percent tip and the waiter was very unhappy but said nothing because it would have been unprofessional and he expected it anyway since she was so old . The old lady left the wine bar with Concord in her stomach . His next adventure involved a digestive tract ending with an up close and personal look at a toilet and sewer system that would eventually send him back to the very pond he had grown up near . His adventure was finally complete . <h> 6 thoughts on " Concord the Grape " <p> That was great .. Hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ..

@@106055562 @1455562/ <h> A Revelation ! <p> Today is May 22 , 2011 . It looks like we all survived The Rapture yesterday . It was supposed to occur at 6:00 PM in New York City and I had a shift scheduled for 7:00 . Since I always put 100% of my faith in 89 year old crazy evangelists , I totally assumed that I would not have to go to work last night . By 6:30 , it seemed like I better get my ass in gear and iron my uniform . And when I say " iron " I mean , pull it out of the dirty clothes hamper and smooth it out after scraping all the dried food off of it . I was totally rushed and barely got to work on time . Thanks a lot , Rapture . You totally suck . When I got there , I was told that our head chef did n't  show up for work , so I was to be prepared for a clusterfuck of an evening . My first thought was that he had been taken unto the bosom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorta a loser and probably just got too drunk to bother with employment . A real pro . My station was already sat . My first table had two of the brattiest children I have ever seen . Another table had a two senior citizens who immediately ordered hot teas and my other table asked for separate checks before I even said hello . " Maybe the Rapture did occur , " I thought . " Is this is my own personal hell ? " When one of the kids threw his sippy cup onto the floor spilling his milk all over the fucking place I was pretty certain that this was in fact Hades . This was no ordinary brat . This was the spawn of the devil sitting at booth number seven and it was my eternal destiny to constantly pick up crap off the floor after he continually throws it there . <p> The kitchen was slower than Abe Vigoda trying to get an erection and it was a constant battle to get a dessert out of there without it taking more than 15 minutes . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday shift , not a Saturday . Perhaps people had really expected Judgement Day and that is why no one came into the restaurant last night . Had people barricaded themselves in their bunkers and basements and just stayed there all night ? Had the rain from the afternoon kept people from wanting to venture out into the evening ? Possibly , but my guess is that everyone stayed home to watch Pretty in Pink that was on Nickelodeon last night . How can you resist the temptation of Molly Ringwald and Jon Cryer ( in his pre-Two and a Half Men days ) . <p> The evening plodded on without any major disruptions other than slow kitchen times . I had one table of four ask me to please leave a pitcher of water on the table because they were all heavy drinkers . Of water . I acquiesced because I aim to please . It was also going to be easier than filling water glasses every thirty seconds . All of a sudden Moe takes it off the table and chastises me because it " looks bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manager . He is a waiter , just like me . I always ignore him but last night I actually stood up to him . " They want it there , Moe . They drink a lot of water . " I said .

They asked for a pitcher of water for the table and I gave it to them . If that 's what they want , they can have it . " " But- " " Leave . The . Pitcher . Moe . Done . Got it ? " <p> Moe sculked off and I patted myself on the back for finally letting this guy know he needs to keep out of my face . It was my on little rapturous redemption .

@@106055568 @1455568/ <h> Baby in Playpen at Willimasburg Brunch ( for real ) <p> In the latest ridiculousness in the world of parents at restaurants , the Internet has been graced with the photo of a couple in Williamsburg , Brooklyn who rolled their crib down the street so that their baby could chill out in it while they had brunch . Or at least that 's what the headlines says . But in actuality , its not a crib . Its a playpen . And we thought strollers were bad ? Now parents are dragging furniture to restaurants ? Why not just bring the rocking chair too so you can rock it to sleep after it spills its bowl of Cheerios ? Or roll down the whole goddamn bedroom and then build some walls around it so you can pretend that you 're still at home . Oh , wait , you 're not at home . You 're at a restaurant . I really do n't  get it . It seems to me that the parents would have had a full conversation about this decision before following through on it . Its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad was getting Junior ready to go to the restaurant and he just decided to bring the playpen and she was all , " Cool , hon. Let 's go . " I would think they they really discussed it first . <p> " Wouldnt it be awesome if restaurants had playpens for babies ? " says Dad . " I mean , really , it would be like so cool because Junior would have a place to hang out and wed know hed be comfortable but not stuck in his stroller , you know ? Pass me the Doritos , man . " <p> " Oh . My . God . That is such a good idea , honey , " says Mom . " Why do n't  restaurants have playpens ? They totally should . These Girl Scout cookies are delicious but they 're stale . How old are they ? Where did they come from ? " <p> " Some bitch at work was selling them for her daughter . We need to change this screen , its all clogged , " says Dad as he flicks the orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought on 23rd Street and Sixth Avenue in front of the Best Buy . He coughs , as smoke billows across the living room . <p> " Cough , you get off , " says his wife . " So , maybe we should buy a restaurant and put playpens next to every booth so cool parents like us will have a place to eat brunch with their babies , " she says as she reaches across the coffee table for the pipe . " We should mix the Doritos with the Girl Scout cookies , thatd be good right ? " <p> " It is good , " says Dad . " I did it already . So when are we gon na buy the restaurant with playpens ? " <p> Twenty minutes later these parents are at Rosarita Fish Shack asking if its cool to set up a piece of fucking furniture on the sidewalk . Looking at the photo , the kid looks plenty old enough to be sitting in a booster seat . My favorite part of the picture is the lady sitting at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " What the fuck are they doing ? " or " I wonder how I can get my couch over here . " I also like the little girl in the back of the photo who is holding her moms hand . You just know that about ten seconds after this picture was taken , that little girl pulled a Veruca Salt and screamed out , " Mommy , I want my playpen at the restaurant ! " <p> I suppose there are some good points to the kid being in its own private wooden jail cell . Its mess would be contained within the confines of the playpen and a playpen is a much bigger target than a stroller for me to drop random pieces of garbage into . But I wonder about the socialization of this kid . Isnt that the age when a parent should begin teaching the child how to behave in public ? It looks like they are missing a teaching moment there . I also wonder about the playpen itself . When was the last time those wheels were rotated ? Does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playpen breaks when you 're pushing it across Bedford Avenue ? I guess the most important question that this situation brings up is " How am I supposed to push a baby out of my way if its stuck in a playpen and not wandering around my station ? <p> The point of taking your kid to a restaurant is not just to eat there together but to teach your kid how to act in a restaurant . I started this process with our son when he was an infant , because I was damned if I was n't going to have one of those kids who was allowed to roam around and drive wait staff crazy . Believe it or not , if you make it a rule that your kid must : 1 ) Sit in his/her seat at all times ; 2 ) Refrain from loud screeching ; 3 ) Learn to order politely from the menu ; and 4 ) Treat wait staff with respect They can actually do this . Of course , this assumes that the parents have already mastered these skills . <p> I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a brilliant idea . Take note that they could have turned the playpen so it was n't sticking out onto the sidewalk , thereby making it an annoyance to everyone , including passersby . I really fucking hate people who do n't  give a single thought to anyone else but themselves . <p> They do look so proud . Check the dads face outif that is n't the most blatant example of smug-doucheface I have ever seen , I do n't  know what is . You cant see the moms face that well , but she is definitely trying to pull of the casual because I know I 'm cool body language . <p> Well , yeah .. Huge server annoyance . The thing is , I see this all the time with people positioning their strollers and high chairs in the most stupid and inconvenient places .

Less than minimum wage . I make $4.60 an hour . That means if I work 40 hours , I would only get $184 for the whole week . That does not even pay for my internets and phone service . Out of that humongous sum of money , I have to pay taxes on tips ( whether I get them or not ) and my paycheck is usually zero . That 's right , I said zero . Waiters pay taxes on a percent of their sales even if they got stiffed on a check . If I ring up a $75 check and Cunty McCuntcunt decides to leave only $5 , the government is still going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip . Uh huh . I pay taxes on tips I do n't  even get . It sucks . Which is why customers must leave at least 15% for the tip . Some people are too stupid to figure it out , so they just leave 10% . Ignorance is not an excuse . If you need help , just double the tax so you would be leaving about 16% . Out of the tip that we are given then we have to tip out of it to the bartender and the food runner and the busser . I worked at one place once and we had to tip 40% of what we made . That sucked and I only lasted there for three days . But plenty of people work there and have to tip out the coffee girl , the guacamole maker , the hostess and the ass-wiper in the bathroom . If you have a crappy waiter , sure , maybe they do n't  deserve more than 10% . But a good one deserves 20% . I deserve 25%.

It is also assumed that once you " make it " as an actor , you will never have to tie an apron around your waist or a noose around your neck because your time with a tray is behind you . Not necessarily . Sometimes , we actors get a six-week contract that let 's us do a show and then its back to the grind . I know plenty of people who have been on Broadway who were back in the restaurant business as soon as the show closed . But what about established Hollywood types who make movies ? Why would they ever want to go back to waiting tables ? If you know Justin Long , you can ask him because that is exactly what he did last month here in New York City .

One lady was asking him questions about the menu and he was just making up answers " Again , Justin , stop being so freaking funny . My sides hurt . For real . Stop it . The source goes on to say , " Hed come back in the kitchen , grabbing menus , filling waters , asking questions . The chef was laughing at him . Justin was totally cool .

Did he do side work ? Did he have to roll silverware at the end of the night ? Nah , he just took the few bucks that people gave him and tossed it to the sad employees as if they should be so happy that he graced them with this event .

I took a journey out to Brooklyn yesterday which is quite the trek when you consider I started in Queens and the MTA is a big hot mess that holds New Yorkers hostage . You never know what you 're going to get when you swipe that Metro Card at the turnstile and get on the 7 train . My reward for braving the subway system was sweet though , for I came across a restaurant in Brooklyn called Chance . Please do not ask me what the food was like because once I saw their happy hour , I was mesmerized : <p> Could it be ? Four dollar martinis , mojitos and margaritas all day Monday through Thursday ? How is this possible ? How have I not already set up a tent in the middle of their dining room and declared it my home ? How have I not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out ? How is that we were the only people at the bar ? I sat down and wiped the drool from my chin and tried to control my shaking hands as I held the menu imagining how far I could go with just twenty dollars . <p> Our bartender was named Jen and she happily made us a round of coconut cosmos . They were a little sweet for my taste but the four dollar price tag made them taste like nectar dripping from a golden flower of paradise onto a rainbow where it slid down onto the horn of a unicorn that was being ridden by Rainbow Brite as she sang an ABBA song . Yeah , I liked it . For my next round I went the pomegranate margarita route because it was clear that I would be drinking my dinner that evening and I needed the vitamins and anti-oxidants that would be present in the juice . To be honest , I do n't  really know what health benefits there are in pomegranate juice , but I like the idea that its good for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of ice and served with a smile . <p> By this point , I was a Chatty Cathy and started yucking it up with Jen .

She was leaning towards " sexy zombie hippie " which covers pretty much every base out there for a costume these days , but as we started getting more into it , we came up with additional ideas . You should go there on Halloween and see if she follows up on Sexy Zombie Ginger Grant from Gilligans Island or Bitter Grown Up Lil Orphan Annie . Either one will be brilliant as long as she puts enough vodka and/or tequila in the drinks that night . <p> We stayed a for a while until it was deemed necessary that food go into the stomach to soak up some of the liquor . Sure , I could have eaten there , but the fresh Autumn air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk a bit and let the vodka and tequila move around . I told Jen to check out the blog , but I doubt she will . She will probably be too busy putting together her Halloween costume and wont have the the time to read this . ( Give me a sign if you 're here , Jen ! ) <p> Go check out Chance in Cobble Hill Brooklyn . Cmon , its four freakin dollars for drinks . How can you resist that temptation ? When you get there , ask if the bartender is named Jen and if its her , tell her Bitchy Waiter said hello . She more than likely will be like , " Um , what are you talking about ? Oh , that drunk guy with the hair that looked like a Brillo pad and would n't shut the fuck up about Halloween ? You know him ? Get the hell out of here right now .

@@106055577 @1455577/ <h> Category Archives : dirty silverware <p> Anyone who has worked in a restaurant knows what a roll-up is and I ai n't  talking about the fruit kind . I 'm talking about the silverware that gets " rolled up " into a napkin and placed lovingly on the table in your station . This is only a facet of your job if you work in a high class establishment that uses linen napkins and not some skanky cheap ass bitch place that uses paper napkins , also known as most of the places I have worked . Doing your roll-ups usually is a part of your sidework at the end of the day . I personally never minded doing them because you got to sit at a table in order to do it and what other sidework is there that let 's you sit ? Its probably the last thing you do at the end of your shift and you just want that shit done so you can go home . I cant tell you how many times I have looked at a rack of sliver and figured that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkin . Depending on the place , you have to roll a certain number of them to be considered finished . At Houlihans we had to do fifty . We had to roll them up and lay them in a row of five and then stack five more on top of that until we had a big stack of semi-clean silver ready for the dinner rush . Since we all hated doing it at the end of the day , we started getting into the habit of doing our fifty before the shift started and then hiding them somewhere so at the end of your shift all you had to do was pull the stack from the hiding place , show it to the shift manager and call it a day . This eventually turned into a problem . When we had six servers who all wanted to do their roll-ups in the morning and then hide them , it meant that we were short 300 roll-ups to put on the tables for lunch . Now I do n't  know about your restaurant , but most of the time utensils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was put to a halt . Another thing we did to avoid the nuisance of rolling silver was to share the same stack . For instance , Jane , Randie , Corrine and I would together roll fifty . Jane would then take the stack to the manager to show him that she had rolled her necessary amount and he would give her the all clear . She would then bring the stack to Randie who would then go to a shift leader and show the same stack of fifty and also get the all clear . Then Corrinne would show the stack to a manager and then I would show it to the shift leader and then bolt the hell out of there because it would only be a matter of time before someone working the dinner shift would notice that instead of 200 roll-ups , there were only 50 . That only worked for a few times before they caught on , but I think it was pretty fucking genius of us . Not to mention lazy . <p> The answer to this issue is clear . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only is it much easier for the servers , it is also cost efficient for the restaurant and also good for the environment . Okay , so maybe its a bit more expensive for the restaurant , but all they have to do is add twenty cents to the cost of a soda and it will blanace itself out . And maybe its not all that great for Planet Earth , but hey , we are talking about making life easier for servers and I think Mother Nature would want it that way . <p> Have you ever had a table ask for a mug of hot water and then when you bring it to them , they use it to sterilize their forks and knives because they think they are n't  clean enough ? Usually , its an old lady who does this and then she makes her brow-beaten husband do it too . Its like they think we do n't  have a highly skilled and well-paid dishwasher in the kitchen making sure each and every plate , glass and utensil is sparkling clean . All dishwashers I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to ensure cleanliness for all . I should know , because it was my first job in the food service industry . Just kidding . Dishwashers do n't  give a shit . How many times have you seen a fork that had a dried piece of whatever the fuck on it and rather than going to find a new one , you just scrape it off and give it to a table ? Or what about when you see a wine glass with lipstick on it ? The right thing to do is get the lipstick off with a napkin and then run it through the dishwasher again but plenty of times , I feel that the napkin wipe is good enough . I 'm not saying that its right , I 'm just saying that it happens . Whenever I eat in a restaurant I work in , I use the to-go utensils . The ones that come in the little plastic bag with a napkin , salt and pepper are the only ones that I know are clean enough for me . Picture the knife that is being used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife is the same one that I wedged under table 23 yesterday to keep it from wobbling . Or that spoon being used to eat smooth creamy vanilla ice cream ? Yeah , I used that spoon a few days ago to cram down the sink and unclog the drain . Or what about the salad bowl ? Yep , that was under the same sink last week catching the drip from the drain that I unclogged with the spoon . <p> One place I worked ( crappy ass VYNL , 78th and Second ) often had a problem with the dishwasher . The machine , I mean and not the highly trained man who ran the machine . It would not work and the poor guy would have to do it by hand . Or maybe the hot water was out so it was going through the machine but only using cold water . One day when I got to work , my co-worker told me to make sure to use plastic forks and to-go containers when I ate that day . I always did anyway , but asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were fucking running the dishwasher without soap . Think about that the next time you 're licking your plate clean .

And our air conditioner does n't  really condition the air as much as it distributes dust and mold to those hard to reach areas of the dining room like the top shelves of the to-go station and where we keep the extra coffee mugs . You chose to sit near the open windows meaning you were willing to accept whatever consequences may come from that . Our restaurant is right next door to a bar and sometimes those bar patrons like to stand on the sidewalk and smoke a cigarette . Sometimes that smoke drifts through our window , but back to you , Guy at Table 5 : chill the fuck out . <p> As I am standing at the computer and surveying my section , I notice that Cigarette Sally and Paul the Pipe from The Bar Next Door have moved to the sidewalk . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside in the cool breeze instead of where I am which is too close to the kitchen , too close to the customers , too close to the steak knives that are just right for slicing my wrist but not close enough to my shift drink . I notice you , Guy at Table 5 , suddenly start to spin your head like Linda Blair on a Tilt-a-Whirl ; your nose crinkling up as you sniff the air like a hound dog catching the scent of a rabbit that has been marinated in Alpo . Your eyes catch sight of the smokers and you start to wave your hand in front of your face to get rid of the stench , much the same way I did when I watched Miley Cyrus perform on the VMAs a few days ago . I do n't  know if you 're allergic to smoke or if you are just a hypersensitive drama queen who grabs every chance to overreact . Its not like they are smoking cyanide and oleander and blowing it in your face . They are outside about thirty feet away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theyre smoking out there . " <p> " Yes , they do that , " I say . <p> " I can smell it . " <p> " Yes , I know . So can I , " I mentally congratulate each of us for having the blessed sense of smell which I sometimes would be willing to give up when I am on the 7 train . <p> " What can you do about it ? " he wants to know . <p> I think about how nice it would be to use this guys face as an ash tray but simply tell him , " They should be done soon . They 're on the sidewalk and they 're not our customers so I cant ask them to put them out . " <p> " Well , you can shut the windows and doors , cant you ? " <p> At this point his girlfriend interjects . " Its okay . Its fine . Do n't  worry about it . " <p> " But you can shut the doors and windows , right ? " he asks again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , its okay , you do n't  have to , " says the girlfriend . <p> " That would be great , " says Guy at Table 5 . <p> The one fucking nice night that we can take advantage of this shitty ass climate I live in , and this asshole is going to ask me to shut the doors and windows so he can eat his hamburger free from the two minutes of smoke that is happening OUTSIDE the restaurant . I close the two windows and shut the front door to the restaurant disappointing not only myself but all the flies in the neighborhood who had heard that it was their night to finally get a firsthand peek at our walk-in . Within five minutes , the temperature of the restaurant increases about five degrees and my mood drops about a hundred . Guy at Table 5 is as happy as a turd in a toilet bowl while everyone else is wondering why the restaurant just get so hot and stagnant . I keep my eyes on Cigarette Sally and Paul the Pipe and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I head back to the windows and doorsto open them up again . I do n't  bother asking Guy at Table 5 , because he s probably too busy wondering where the meat from his burger was sourced ( Key Food ) and if his girlfriend is going to let him have sex with her tonight ( she 's not ) . <p> The next thirty minutes happen without incident until I notice out of the corner of my bloodshot eye that his head is spinning and he is sniffing the air again . I look out the window to see a man standing there sucking on the biggest , thickest , smokiest cigar I have ever seen . Cigar Sam , we call him . It smells horrible , I must agree , but I keep my eyes directed away from Guy at Table 5 because I 'd rather have a cool breeze that may occasionally smell slightly of cigar than no cool breeze at all . I walk past Table 5 , and see that Guy has his hand covering his mouth . His girlfriend is finishing her meal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them so can I. Briefly , I consider giving him a damp towel to breathe through like I see people do in the movies when trapped inside a burning house . Instead , I decide to go to the window . I can sense that Guy at Table 5 is watching me , anticipating the moment when he can breathe fresh clean air again . I reach my hand over to the frame of the window as Guy at Table 5 prepares his lungs for serenity . I lean out the window to the filthy disgusting smoker who is ruining the air for my customer . <p> " Hey , Sam , how ya doing ? " Beautiful night , is n't it ? " I say . <p> Sam exhales , releasing a billowing cloud of smoke that gets caught in the breeze and whips down the street , some it wafting through the window and over to Table 5 . <p> " Sure is , " says Sam . " Sure is . " He coughs . <p> " Well , have a good one . Nice to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - leaving it just as open as it was before . I walk back to the computer and print out the check for Table 5 so its ready for them as soon as they ask for it , which will probably be any second . <p> A business news reporter with the Dallas Morning News lis ooking to connect with waiters and servers in the Dallas Fort Worth/North Texas area . Her name is Karen Robinson-Jacobs . If you fit that criteria and want to help a reporter out , please contact her at krjacobs@dallasnews.com <p> Very often , people come to this blog or to the Facebook page and they are taken aback by all the negativity and bitching . What I do not understand is why anyone would be surprised to find bitching on a website about bitching . Its like going to a porn website and then complaining that all they show is porn . Or going to a Celine Dion website and being upset that all they do is talk about yodeling Canadians . However , in an attempt to be an all-inclusive website , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive . After a few false starts , I discovered that writing about all things positive puts me in a very bad mood . Its just not in me . " What to do , what to do ? " I wondered . " I have n't always been so negative and bitchy have I ? " ( " Yes . Yes you have , " shouts my mom from 1500 miles away . ) I decided to do some digging into my boxes of crap and dig up one of my old diaries to see if I could find an entry that talked about waiting tables in a positive way . It took some time , but I found one . I give to you Non-Bitchy Waiter , circa 1990 : <p> Dear Diary , <p> I am so totally psyched because today was my first day as a waiter and it was , like , totally awesome . I applied at a bunch of restaurants a couple of weeks ago and after a few interviews , I was chosen to work at Bennigans ! ! ! I started today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na like it . I have two weeks of training which is wonderful because it will really give me a chance to learn the menu and make sure I can answer all the questions that a customer might ask . I mean " guest . " ( That 's what we call them ! ) - Its gon na be hard , but I can do it ! ! I know I can ! One thing I like about the place is that there is a jukebox and we can play our favorite music which will make it even more fun to work there . Just today , I heard Vogue , Vision of Love , Pump Up the Jam and Nothing Compares 2 U. Amazing jukebox , right ? ? Another thing hat is great is that they encourage us to be ourselves and we can decorate our apron and suspenders . They call it " flair " and I am going to be the king of it ! I have so many buttons that I have been collecting for so long and now I can finally have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few different ones and change them every day . I have another plan about my apron . Since I am still living with Mammaw , I can use her sewing machine to make cool aprons . Maybe I can make four different ones for each of the days I work . I wonder if there is- contest for Best Flair , because I want to win it if there is ! ! Oh , and I just remembered that I heard an En Vogue song today too ! <p> The girl who trained me is super dooper nice . Her name is Melanie and I feel like we could be friends . She has worked there for nine months so she knows all the ropes . Maybe some day I can be a trainer . I think she gets paid extra to do it which would be really nice . Oh and you know what else ? I get a free meal every day ! There is a section of food off the menu we can choose from . Today I had chicken fingers ! ! FREE ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional food whore slinger of the hash , I am always willing to give a bad server the benefit of the doubt . " Maybe she 's new " or " He s probably having a bad day " are phrases that drop out of my mouth when my server forgets to bring me something or fails to make himself available . I realize that at times , even a full time professional food whore slinger of the hash , like myself , can hit some bumps in the road that keeps my service from being stellar . Just last week , I totally forgot about one of my tables because I had picked it up even though it was n't in my section . I took their order and rang it in but then realized that I was out of Chardonnay . I went to the bar to refill my coffee cup and then the bartender shared a story about how he had gone to a water park the day before . This made me think of a time I was at Blizzard Beach in Disney World . We saw this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing in line for a water slide . The baby looked totally out of it . " Is that baby alive ? " asked my friend Van ? " I du n no , " I replied , " but I wonder if shell let me use it as a floaty for the Lazy River because I cant find any more inner tubes . " I took a swallow of my wine so the bartender could top it off and then I went on to check on my tables completely forgetting about the one that was n't in my section . So , I know bad service sometimes happens to good people . But when it happens to me , I never know what to to tip . <p> The following is an actual text message conversation I had with my brother a few days ago : <p> Coby : Help . We 've just had the worst waitress/service ever . What do I tip ? 9:21 pm <p> BW : What 's the check ? 9:21 pm <p> Coby : Getting it now . 9:22 pm <p> BW : I 'd probably still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was straight up bitch , 10% or less . 9:22 pm <p> Coby : Not bitch . CLUELESS . We sat with our food in front of us for 5-7 minutes without silverware . I had to go get it . 9:27 pm <p> BW:10% . Fuck it . 9:27 pm <p> Coby : Still waiting on check . 9:29 pm <p> BW : 5%. 9:29 pm <p> Coby : Got the check . No pen . 9:33 pm <p> BW : 5% . Fuck that shit . This will be a blog post by the way . 9:33 pm <p> BW : What was the verdict ? 10:45 pm <p> Coby : Gave her 5 on 48. 11:02 pm <p> Was my advice wrong ? What do we do when we have bad service ? We maybe expect the bar to be raised a little bit since we all do it for a living , but if someone is woefully inadequate at their job , its hard to tip them the same as I would for someone who was spectacular . I always start at 20% and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinda have to go out of your way . Even for bad service , I will give 15% . But my brother gave 10% and I stand behind it . He asked for the check at 9:22 and did not get it until 9:33 . Does it really take eleven minutes to hit " print " on a computer and drop a check ? If you 're that far behind , you can always ask someone to drop the check for you . And to sit for over five minutes with hot food in front of you and no silverware is unacceptable . Why wasnt there silver there when they were sat ? - If the food is overcooked and the server fixes the situation there is no reason to stiff them . But what happened in my brothers case seemed like it was all the responsibility of the server . This waitress was lucky to get the 10% . <p> What do you do when you have extraordinarily bad service in a restaurant ? Do you still tip well ? Or do you tip less than you normally would but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do you do it ? A note on the check or a discussion with the manager ? Discuss , please . <p> The following blog post should be read out loud in the voice of one of those private eyes that you would see in a 1940s movie about seedy Los Angeles . Imagine that it is being read by a man wearing a trench coat and a fedora leaning against a lamp post while smoking a cigarette . It is dusk and a shadow covers most of his face . <p> It was a slow night at the restaurant . The cooks were reading newspapers , the servers were sharing an order of fries and the customers were eating anyplace but there . The Bitchy Waiter needed something to do and he needed it then . All of his opening sidework was already done . The last thing that needed to happen was placing the candles in the restrooms . One of them had been locked so he put the lit candle on a shelf and waited for whichever employee was inside to come out . Erika , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the candle inside . He noticed the toilet still had paper in it . " Geez , flush the fucking toilet , new girl , " he thought . Hanging on the wall was an empty roll of toilet paper and sitting on the tank was a brand new roll that had been unwrapped but she must have been too lazy to throw away the empty roll and replace it with a new one . Thirty minutes had passed and now he was bored . He looked at the pile of silverware that needed to be rolled and then his eyes fell onto the empty ketchup bottle but nether one of those were going to make him feel constructive . <p> " Maybe I 'll go make a phone call , " he said to the mirror over the sidestand ; the same mirror that was in need of a date with some Windex . He reached up to the shelf and picked up his cell phone ; the same cell phone that was strictly prohibited on the dining room floor . He headed straight to the restroom where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung the door open , flipped the light on and stepped inside . <p> " Goddammit ! " Looking down , his skid-resistant shoes were in an inch of water . The toilet was running and the bowl was overflowing with water . Toilet paper was spinning in a lazy clockwise pattern and enjoying its freedom from the bowels of sewage and grasping at its chance to see what life is like on the floor . " Who the fuck clogged the fucking toilet bowl ? " <p> The Bitchy Waiter shoved his cell phone into his pocket and went to tell the manager . " The restroom needs some attention . Bad . " He watched his manager scurry over to Jose the dishwasher and the two of them retreated to the restroom . <p> " What 's goin on ? " asked the bartender ? <p> " The toilet overflowed and now my shoes are all fucking disgusting . " <p> " Who the fuck ? I bet it was table 16 . " We looked over at the lone table in the restaurant . Sitting at the booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from visiting one of the two restrooms . " He looks like he could clog a toilet real good . " <p> " Uh huh , " said The Bitchy Waiter as he eyed Erika slicing some carrots . " Maybe it was him . Maybe not . " <p> The manager reappeared rolling behind him a big yellow mop bucket and holding a dirty mop that no doubt now had traces of fecal matter that would be spread all over the restaurant the next day unless someone changed the mop head . But no one ever changed the mop head . <p> " Its okay now , " the manager said . " Someone tried to flush the toiler paper wrapper but I plunged it . " He went downstairs to return the mop bucket and hopefully replace the mop head . <p> The bartender looked at table 16 again . " It was totally that guy , right ? " <p> " I do n't  think so , " said The Bitchy Waiter . " Someone else was in there first and that someone else is now slicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there right after she came out and I noticed the toilet wasnt flushed . She had finished a roll of toilet paper and opened a new one . The boss said that whoever it was tried to flush the toilet paper wrapping and that 's what made it overflow . So yeah . I think it was her . That bitch took a huge fucking dump , clogged the toilet and now she 's making a salad . " <p> They both looked over at Erika who was using her hands to mix some Caesar dressing into a bowl of romaine lettuce . <p> The bartender shuddered . Okay , now I am totally grossed out by her and I thought she was kinda cool . " <p> The Bitchy Waiter agreed . " I know . If you 're gon na clog the toilet at least try to fix it yourself . I mean the plunger is right there , but she 's just gon na act like nothin happened ? That is some nasty shit , man . " <p> " Well , maybe it was the guy at 16 , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he tried to flush the toilet , it overflowed . " <p> " Yeah , maybe . But I 'm gon na just go with it being her . I read a lot of Encyclopedia Brown books when I was a kid and I 'm pretty good at figuring out mysteries . The clues point to her . " <p> " Caesar salad is up for 16 , " yelled Erika . <p> The Bitchy Waiter went to the line and picked up the salad . " Thanks , " he said . <p> " No problem , " she replied . " Looks like its gon na be a slow night , huh ? " <p> " Maybe . You never can tell . Sometimes you think its gon na be slow and then all of a sudden the restaurant is overflowing and in a flush you 're busy . " <p> " What ? she asked . <p> " I meant flash . Thanks for the salad . " <p> The Bitchy Waiter dropped the Caesar salad at table 16 and went into the other restroom to make his phone call . His night was just beginning . 
@@106055585 @1455585/ <h> Category Archives : carpet cleaning <p> I may have mentioned before that I have had a lot of restaurant jobs and therefore I have quit a lot of restaurant jobs . Every once in a while , I will give my employer the standard two weeks notice but on the very rare occasion ( okay , almost every time ) I will just decide that I am done with a certain job and move on immediately . That is how I left Houlihans . Both times . Yes , I worked there , quit with no notice and then they hired me back later . I do n't  know who was more desperate , me or them . The second time I quit , I had really had it . I remember that it was a few before Christmas and I was sick to death of serving the dredge that had to come see The Radio City Christmas Ex-crap-aganza . Houlihans squeezed every drop of energy I had in my body and milked me dry . It was late at night probably around 1:00 AM or so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to get the fuck out . Our assistant manager came out of the office to give us a vital piece of information that he had forgotten to tell us hours earlier : the carpets were being cleaned that night and we had to move all the tables and chairs off the carpet and into the bar area . And he just told us this now ? I wanted to strangle him . I wanted him to suffer a slow death . I wanted to force feed him a Houlihans chicken stir fry which may be the worst fate anyone would ever have to endure . That was the straw that broke this camels bitchy ass back . That was something we should have been told hours before so we could start preparing . You know , as soon as a table was cleared drag it over to the bar so we would n't have to do all of them at once . There are no words to explain how pissed I was . I recall dragging chairs and throwing them with all my strength ( which is not very strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar and letting them crash into the wall and the floor . My manager told me to take it easy and I gave him a big look of " fuck you . " I had already done my money drop so there was really nothing keeping me there except for this carpet cleaning crap . After moving about four tables I decided I needed to leave . Christmas was days away and I really wanted that day off to go to mass and celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ our Heavenly savior . Either that or wake up and have mimosas on that day . Which ever one , it was time to compose my letter of resignation . I picked up a bev nap and did that very thing . <p> Dear Houlihans , Effective immediately , I quit . <p> I laid the napkin on the managers desk , punched out and went home . I assume the carpets got cleaned . Good thing they were worried about the carpets . Yeah , the carpets were the grossest thing in that place , sure .

The purpose of complaining should be that you want a different action . Otherwise , its just for the sake of complaining . <p> Going out to dinner with a large group of people . Allow me to explain : <p> Its never easy , is it ? I do n't  think I would like it even if I did n't  have years of experience on the other side of the menu . In a group of ten people , there is always someone who wants to scam in order to save themselves a few bucks . " Oh , I have to catch a train , so I 'm gon na just throw my money in now for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be enough , " and they skedaddle their cheap ass outta there . Even Andrew Jackson himself knows that the order of nachos and two beers was more than twenty bucks . He rolls his eyes in embarrassment from having been inside that tacky whores tacky knock-off Prada bag that she bought on Canal Street.This happened to me last week . I went to celebrate a birthday with a friend . Drinks were had , jokes were made and mechanical bulls were ridden . At the end of the night , the patron saint of waiters gave us our check . Of course the cheapest people at the table grabbed it first . God forbid they should be the last one to hold it and have to pay an extra two or three bucks . The cheapest bitch of them all was a a friend of a friend who I have absolutely no allegiance to so I do n't  give a shit if her cheap ass reads this or not . After I finally commandeered the bill so I could make sure everything was happening as it was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheap Bitch said , " I 'm using a credit card and need to pay ten dollars . " " Ten dollars ? What all did you have ? " I asked . <p> " One margarita , that 's it . " <p> I looked at the bill in my hand . One small margarita was $9.00 . ( Truth be told , I did n't  even know there was such a thing as small margarita . Mine was $13.00 . What the fuck is the point of a small margarita anyway ? ) " So your margarita is nine dollars and you 're going to leave ten ? What about tax and tip ? " I asked in front of the whole table . <p> " Yeah , my drink was nine so I 'm leaving ten . " <p> I hated this bitch . " So for tax and tip , you 're leaving a dollar ? " <p> " Well , what do you think I 'm supposed to leave ? " she wanted to know . Her head was swaying back and forth like she was daring me to give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , tax is about 8.25% so that means you are leaving about a twenty-five cents for a tip ?

" <p> " I have a very limited credit card and alls I can afford is ten dollars ! " <p> That ai n't  a credit card , honey , that 's just sad . " Fine , " I said and went on with figuring out the rest of the check . <p> When I finally got it all settled , she told me that she went on ahead to the waiter and paid her portion because she had to go .

I went to the waiter to make sure she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bitch did n't  pay for tax OR a tip . Nine dollars , period . I 've met her once before and was n't that impressed , but from now on she is dead to me . <p> How can people be like that ? If you know that tax exists , you have to at least pay that part of your bill , right ? Okay , so she did n't  tip . No surprise . She also turned down a piece of birthday cake . I know it was because the restaurant was charging a $1.50 slicing fee per person and she did n't  want to pay that . She also finagled for someone else to pay the $5.00 required to ride the mechanical bull . " Oh , I do n't  have my i.d . so they wo n't let me buy a ticket , " she claimed .

She did not pay it back , She rode the bull and I wish more than anything it would have bucked her cheap ass though the wall and into the mens room where she could have enjoyed a big bite of urinal cake . <p> The check was eventually paid and the waiter was very happy with his tip . There was no slicing fee though and I think it was because we offered him the last piece of cake . We gave him some cake , he left off the slicing fee . He left off the slicing fee , we tipped him better . What goes around comes around which is exactly why Cheap Bitch will get her karma some day . Like maybe shell get a hell of a paper cut from her buy one get one free coupon for generic tampons . Cheap bitch . <p> What a day I had today . First off , let me say this : I did not mean to poison anybody , alright ? It was an accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asshole . It was his fault that all them people was taken to the hospital . Lemme start at the beginning . <p> It was just another day at the job . I was working a banquet for the Chicago University Club and I was doing me usual job of setting up the tables and polishing all the silverware and I was supposed to be washing dishes later on . The people were supposed to get there at 5:00 for dinner but at 4:00 we was so far behind it looked like wed be lucky to serve by 7:00 . A lot of workers called in sick saying they had a touch of the typhoid fever but I know they was all lying . The boss was cracking the whip trying to get us to do the work of the ten men who was probably nursing their hangovers and not going through the sweats of the fever at all . At 4:45 , he throws an old ratty tuxedo jacket at me and says , " You 're a waiter tonight . Hell tell you what to do . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette . The man has dark wavy hair that hangs in his eyes and he is leaning against a wall as if his sole purpose is to keep it from falling down . His eyes look mean . I 'd never talked to him before but I knew who he was : Jean Crones . He has a reputation of being a loner , a thief , a womanizer , lazy and I have also heard he was born with the tail of the devil but he cut it off with an axe when he was a kid . Nobody likes him and we all figure he must have something on the boss because if he did n't  , he would have been fired a long time ago . <p> I hold out my hand to shake his but he flicks a cigarette ash into it instead . " You get tables fifteen to twenty . Go get the bread ready and put it at your tables and then on mine , eleven to fourteen . " <p> " Why do you have four tables and I have six ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth and removes some tobacco from his tongue . " Fuck off . " <p> Thirty minutes later the hall is full of rich people in fancy clothes and I am doing all the work for my tables as well as Jean Crones . I ai n't  never waited tables before but its pretty much like being at me mums house ; just get what people ask for and say " yes maam " a lot . <p> When it comes time to clear the tables for coffee service , I notice that Jean is no where to be found . I had seen him just a few minutes earlier at the big giant coffee urns and I am surprised because it looks like he is actually making coffee instead of telling me to do it . I also notice that he is lingering there for a long time but I do n't  think nothing of it . I also do n't  think nothing of him pouring some powder into the urns because I just thought it was sugar of some sort . <p> I serves the coffee to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help but notice he has a big grin on his face while he s doing it like he s enjoying his job all of a sudden . He even gives coffee to the people who say they do n't  want it and I see him pour some into a cup for a little girl who I had almost tripped over not ten minutes before when she was playing with her dolly in the aisle . <p> About ten minutes later , it gets awful weird in there . People start excusing themselves to the toilets and the line at the john is stretched around the whole room . I hears people saying they have headaches and dizziness and I figure its just the heat in the room but when people start vomiting all over the place , I knows we have a problem . Meanwhile , Jean is back in his corner holding up the wall again while smoking another cigarette . And he s laughing . I do n't  see nothing funny about 100 people puking their guts up and its even less funny when me boss tells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go get the mop . <p> The doctors are called and the place is crawling with coppers because they figure that someone must have poisoned the customers . Right away I know it was Jean Crones and I try to tell them , but they do n't  listen to me . I 'm just a lousy nobody mopping up vomit , after all . The cops arrest all of us workers and throw us in the back of the paddy wagon for questioning . Of course , Jean Crones is nowhere to be found . <p> Three people died in that hall . Most of us were let go from the jail but they kept four men who admitted that they had put Mickey Finn Powder in the coffee . They bought it for 20 cents from W. Stuart Wood who was selling it at the bar at the waiters union headquarters . He made the powder with his wife and they was both arrested too . Everyone said it was Jean Crones idea to begin with . He wanted to " give them rich folks something to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jean Crones . He should pay for his crime , he should . Them people did n't  deserve to get poisoned and they sure did n't  deserve to die . Well , that little girl that got sick kinda deserved it . She was running all over the place and screaming like a right out little brat , she was . She left a pile of toasted oats under her table and who do you think had to clean that up ? Me , that 's who. - <p> So , diary , it was quite the day alright indeed . I left me house this morning as a dishwasher and came home with a whole days worth of experience waiting tables . I hope to leave my days as a dishwasher behind and start a new life as a waiter . Its got to be better than scrubbing pots and pans for a living . Jean Crones may have had a helping hand in poisoning a 100 people today but he also gave me a chance at a brighter future . I 'm a waiter now , thanks to his training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better life for myself . Well , except for that whole poisoning people bit . I do n't  think most servers want to go around killing their customers . Or maybe they do . What do I know ? I 've only been a waiter for one day . <p> A couple of restaurants in Burlington , Vermont are in hot water ( " Its not hot enough , " yelled an old lady who brought in her own tea bag. ) after they were caught adding the gratuity to the check of a family they assumed to be French-Canadian . Two different restaurants added the tip to the bill for the family but it turns out that they are actually residents of Vermont who just spoke French . The family was none too pleased . <p> The servers in Quebec are making $8.35 an hour while Vermont servers are making $4.10 an hour . Maybe the servers in Canada are n't  as dependent on tips as Vermont servers are so maybe the tipping is n't as crucial up north . I find it hard to believe that so many Canadians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfamiliar with the tipping customs in our country . Is it possible that some foreigners are feigning ignorance just so they can skip out on the tip ? I think it is not only possible , but very likely . <p> Working in New York City , I serve customers from all over the world . Its hard to not cringe when I hear a foreign accent asking me what the specials are . No , I do n't  want to generalize that every single customer from another country is a bad tipper , but very often it is the case . Do n't  these tourists read guide books before coming to the United States ? Whenever I go on vacation , I do . I will be going to France in two weeks ( home to the worlds surliest servers and maybe a place I will end up staying forever just so I can feel " at home . " ) , and I have been studying guide books for a month now to make sure I understand how to act in their country . I do not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do my best to fit in and tip correctly . According to guide books , the service charge in Paris restaurants is added to the bill , so you only leave a nominal tip in appreciation of good service . Tell me , Parisians , is this true ? I can only assume that the guide book is correct . Could it be that the guide books that United States tourists are reading are misinforming them ? I wonder what the books say in regards to tipping . I hope it says something like " Servers in the U.S. expect a tip for a job well done . 15-20% of the bill is standard , more if they did an outstanding job or less if the service was less than exemplary . " For all I know , it says . " Servers in the U.S. wait tables for the pure joy of it . Their hourly wage is more than adequate and they are pleased with a a dollar or even a verbal good job. In some cases , feel free to leave Bible quotes or coupons . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people tip is great big Pandoras Box that once opened can never be closed . It can easily go from a discussion about tipping to an argument about race and I do not want to go there . I have said it before and I will say it again : I try to treat every table the same so that if I get stiffed I know it was because of them and not me . You will hear plenty of servers complain about the crap tip they got from the four-top of black women but did that server automatically give them crap service because they assumed the tip would be bad ? Possibly . But have n't we all gotten great tips from someone who we did n't  expect to get one from ? Conversely , we have all gotten horrible tips from someone that we thought was going to leave at least 20% . Waiting tables is like a slot machine . You never know what you 're going to get , but it all evens out in the end . <p> But back to Burlington , Vermont : should the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say no . If you 're going to add the tip automatically to some tables , it has to be on all tables . Otherwise , its just racial profiling and who has time to racially profile when there is coffee to make and bread baskets to fill ? <p> I have gotten bad tips from French people . I have also been stiffed by French people . Its the way of the waiter world . When I am in France , I will do my best to tip accordingly but if I fuck it up , I feel like its okay . They probably hate me as soon as I sit down just like I would hate them if they sat in my station . I expect the only difference would be that I would pretend to like them while the French waiter will look down at me and openly mutter with disgust , " Stupid , Americain , pig . " Seriously , I might love it there and apply for a job at le Pain Quotidien in downtown Paris and serve French Toast and French Fries all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work . Well , from 7:00 until about 9:00 , it is rockin . There are two of us on the floor and we are weaving amongst each other in perfect synchronicity . Every time I go to refill a glass , I see it has just been done by the other server and more than once I see him go to the window to check on food that I had just run to the table . We are a good team . The customers are happy and I am in a good mood which is very surprising considering there is very little white wine in my system . Suddenly at 9:10 , the restaurant dies a slow agonizing death . What had been a healthy vibrant restaurant throbbing with life and excitement is now wheezing for breath and struggling to find someone who wants to order some calamari . By 10:15 , the last customer is gone , the other server has been sent home and I am left alone with the bartender waiting until closing time at 11:00 . Sidework is done and I even reorganized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was that bored . At 10:40 , I start to send out vibes to passers-by to let them know if they decide to eat now , I will resent them until the day I die and then after I die I will haunt their sorry asses forever . <p> Bored , I head to the patio to see if it needs any attention . I pick up an errant lemon wedge and straw wrapper . I notice that a big spider has spun its web linking it from the fence to the giant Pelligrino patio umbrella . I toss a leaf into the web so I have something to watch as the spider races to the unwelcome item . Once he discerns it is not a fly or some other tasty morsel , he tosses the leaf to the ground . I throw another leaf into the web for an encore performance . It is now 10:45 . <p> The candles are still lit on the tables because we do not want to give the impression that we are closing early . Knowing that my manager does not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I leave the chalkboard scrawled with the words " No Smoking " on the patio as well as the two tables that will need to be dragged inside . At 10:56 , I untie my apron and walk over to my manager who is scrubbing the line and wiping down the stove . " Do you mind if I run downstairs and get the book ? " I ask . The " book " is what I fill in every night with who worked and what we made in tips . <p> The manager looks at the clock and then back at me . " Well , were not closed yet . " <p> Is she for real ? All I want to do is run to the office and get the book so I can get a two fucking minute head start in entering information . The date , the names , etc . " Okay . Ill wait four minutes . " I put my apron back on . <p> Five minutes later , at 11:01 , I blow out the candles , drag the tables inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My manger graciously brings " the book " upstairs for me . " Thank you , " I say . She does not respond . <p> At 11:06 , I am finished . The tips have been logged , the goodbyes have been said and the apron has been removed for the night . And then she has something else to say to me . <p> " I need people to be here who encourage customers to come in late , not people who are ready to leave . " <p> I am getting angry . <p> " I do n't  want it to look like we are closed when we are still open , " she continues . I guess me going downstairs to pick up a blue binder would somehow signify to the world that we are closed , while scrubbing the line and wiping down the stove in our open kitchen is screaming to customers " Come in , were open ! " <p> " Did I do something wrong ? " I ask . " Because all I did was ask to go get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone in here for 45 minutes . " <p> " Well , its just- " <p> " Because I do n't  see how me getting the book four minutes before closing is any different than you breaking down the line , " I continue . <p> " Well , we need to be busier late at night , " she tells me <p> I am still trying to figure out how that affects me . Does she want me to wear a fucking sandwich board in front of the restaurant ? Would she like me to telephone people at random and just let them know , " Hey , were still open in case you 're wondering . " Or maybe I should tell the guests who come in at 7:00 that they should go home and come back in three hours . None of this is my fault or my problem . She was just being snippy because she sees profits dwindling and she ca n't be mean to the economy but she can be mean to me . And if she wants there to be more customers then maybe she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  want to do that . Or maybe have a happy hour . Oh wait , she does n't  want to do that either . If I thought she would listen to me , I would suggest that he offers 15% off to anyone who comes in after 9:00 . I think that is a great idea , but what do I know ? I 'm just a waiter . <p> I punch out and go home and then debate whether or not I should blog about this on the off chance that she reads it . Obviously , I decide to write it . Nothing I have said here is wrong . I even gave some handy dandy suggestions on how she could gain more customers . I kinda know a little bit about pimping oneself out for the sake of more followers and its not any different than getting more customers . Maybe she is reading this and when I get back to work , she will want to discuss it with me . I will cross that bridge when I come to it but before I cross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions from the troll who lives under it . So let me answer those now and get it out of the way : <p> Yes , the Chicken Caesar salad has chicken in it.No , I do not have another " real job " because this one seems real enough.We close at 11:00 . <p> Wish me luck on this post . I might be digging my own grave but as long as the grave has a mini-bar , I 'm good . <p> Ahh , the mandatory meeting . In no other job outside of the restaurant industry have I been expected to attend a meeting that may or may not be on my day off . Of course , what other job have I had that is outside the restaurant , so how would I fucking know ? The most recent one I was forced to attend was in fact on my day off . Sure , we may get paid for it , but like I need that extra $5.00 for an hour long meeting . I 'd rather have my day off , thanks . The meetings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whoever the fuck else shows up to burp out some words of wisdom . This particular meeting was also attended by a silent partner who was anything but silent . Every time he piped in , I automatically dismissed his comments because he knows absolutely nothing about serving . Besides , his wardrobe looked like he raided the closet of Mr. Furley and how can anyone take him seriously ? The meetings are meant to inspire , challenge , correct and educate but really all they do is create a big " shut the fuck up " moment that happens collectively among the employees . These people show up and act like they know what is best even though they only show their faces once every four or five months Their ideas may look good on paper , but they need a healthy dose of reality . Unless you are in the restaurant every day , you really do n't  know how things work . Do I resent them ? Oh hell yes . <p> At the most recent mandatory meeting , I took notes because I wanted to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper in order to memorize them and make our establishment a better place . No not really . I took the notes so I could put them on this blog and people could see how utterly lame and pointless the meeting was . These are a few of the things that were deemed important enough for me to forfeit my day off and drag my ass to work for an hour : <p> Up sell . No shit . Anyone who has waited tables for more than a hot second knows this point . " A vodka/tonic , sir ? Is there any vodka in particular you would like ? Might I suggest Grey Goose , Kettle One or Any Other Way Expensive Brand ? " <p> No eating while on the clock . Yeah , right . Uh huh . Sure . You try working an eight hour shift with no break and see if you do n't  grab a handful of whatever you can get . <p> No drinking.Excuse me , how the hell do you expect me to deal with the bitch at table 18 if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic cup ? <p> No cell phones at work.Now that is just dumb . Look , I 'm not going to be answering my phone whilst taking an order but I will have my cell phone with me . I need it . It is very important that my phone is in my possession so when someone stiffs me I can take a picture of their credit card receipt and publish it to Facebook . Its what I do . T-Mobile made me do it . <p> Be friendly . Oh , really ? I thought I was supposed to openly show my disdain for my guests . Thanks for pointing that one out . <p> Be upbeat . That 's why I need the plastic cup of Pinto Grigio . <p> Do your sidework . Again , this pearl of wisdom fell right off the Obvious Truck . <p> Respect one another and respect your managers.Now that is just fucking hilarious . <p> Yes , that was the extent of the meeting . Why they did n't  simply send us an email or text message , I 'll never know . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jacket combo and felt that a mandatory meeting was the best way to do that . As for the information we were given , file them all under " no , duh " and call it a day . Here are a few more nuggets of wisdom I am surprised they did n't  mention to us . All equally obvious but just as important : <p> Wear your pants at work at all times . <p> Do not floss your teeth while standing at a table . Do this in the sidestand or the service bar . <p> Do not pour vodka on a guest and light them on fire no matter how tempting it is . <p> No pets allowed . <p> Be alive when you show up to work . <p> Clock in and out so we can pay you even though you do this for the love of it and not the money . <p> No smoking crack , shooting heroin or tripping on acid while on the clock . <p> When someone orders something , ring it in , and then bring it to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid that you may not understand your function as a server and we feel better if we point out the obvious . It makes us feel superior to you because we all have small penises and have to exhibit or machismo and authority every chance we get . <p> I hate the obligatory mandatory meetings in the restaurant world . Only once has the meeting been worth attending . We had a pizza party at it . Next time I go , I 'll just have to make sure my plastic cup of Pinto Grigio is full . <p> Warning : working at Red Lobster could be dangerous to your health . No , I am not talking about grazing on all the fried popcorn shrimp you can eat , I am talking about a particular Red Lobster where customers seem to have no problem beating the hell out of servers . <p> At a Red Lobster in Fairview Heights , Illinois last week , three woman assaulted their waitress for filling up their water glasses too often . Yes , this waitress was trying to do her job and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a glass that hit her in the back of the head and then a dessert menu to the face . The three delicate flowers are now facing felony assault charges while the waitress is facing a severe case of " why the fuck do I work at Red Lobster ? " The server was treated at the scene but stayed at work . I do not understand that . Had a customer hit me in the head with a glass , my ass would be rolling on the floor yelping in pain as I hit 1-800- SUE A BITCH on my speed dial . This is the same restaurant that just six months ago was home to a beat down when four women kicked the ass of their waitress after she brought out the wrong food . I have some advice for all those servers at that Red Lobster : <p> What the hell are you doing there ? Get out , now . Even in the best case scenario , working at a Red Lobster is a crap job but you are willing to be at one where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table ? How much money are you pocketing there that is making it worth while ? I looked at your restaurant on Google Maps and I see that right down the street is a Joes Crab Shack , Olive Garden , TGI Fridays and a place called Ginger Buffet . Sure , all those places suck too , but at least they have n't been on the news yet because some bitch is attacking your ass . Red Lobsters slogan is " Come see what 's fresh today " not " Come sit in my station and kick my teeth out . " This replaced the old slogan " For the seafood lover in you " which in Fairview , Illinois translated to " Fuck you bitch , I ai n't  ordered the Seafood Shrimp Trio , I had the Admirals Feast . Get the fuck out my face . " <p> I went to the Red Lobster website and found their mission statement . After reading it though a couple of times , I thought it needed some tweaking . Hopefully , they will see my suggestions and take them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about serving our guests great seafood everything . It 's why we go the extra mile to bring you the bestmost dangerous dining experience possible . Our fishermenimporters take pride in catching thawing out only the highest quality seafood and the freshest fish . Our grill master 's line cooks expertly perfect flavors , cooking seafood and steak over a wood fire grill cook . And our servers pull out all the stopswear padding and bullet proof vests to make every dining experience feel extra special moderately safe . It 's our passion . It 's our pride . Because at Red Lobster , we Sea Food Differentlythat our customers are trashy but we just do n't  care.G <p> I wonder if anyone reading this blog works at a Red Lobster . If so , would you care to share with us some insight as to how something like this might happen ? I do n't  get it . I have had customers get upset about things , but it has never gotten to the point where I felt in danger . Is this something that anyone else has experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass at you ? Continue working or go the fuck home ? That question is easy for me . I would n't have been there in the first place unless they were having a " buy one get three free " cocktail special at the bar .

I know , I know , suggestive selling is supposed to up the checks and therefore increase my tip , but for some reason I ca n't get into it . I am equally apathetic about up-selling . For those of you unfamiliar with these waiter tactics , let me explain : <p> Customer : Can I get some more water and the check , please ? <p> Waiter : Of course , would you like bottled water or just plain tap ? And can I get you a cup of coffee and dessert first ? <p> Customer : Well , I guess coffee would be nice <p> Waiter : Okay , great . One coffee . And can I put some Bailey 's in it for you and also bring you a piece of our delicious and decadent brownie bottom death by chocolate hot fudge brownie pie ala mode as well ? <p> Customer : Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well , we also have a lighter dessert of mango and papaya sorbet with fresh seasonal berries . And can I bring you an aperitif possibly ? Or maybe some brandy ? <p> Customer : Just coffee . <p> Waiter : May I suggest another chicken parmagiana then ? Or a bottle of wine ? Or maybe you would like to start your dinner over again . Would you like soup or salad ? <p> Customer : Just bring me the fucking check . <p> I hate when waiters do that to me , so I do n't do it to my tables . I feel like if they want dessert they will ask me for it . They do n't need me to suggest it . And if someone asks for water , I will assume they meant tap water . If I order water and the waiter brings me some overpriced bullshit bottle of natural spring water , I will not be pleased . I like tap . I am cheap . The two go hand in hand . Or what about those places that sticks a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want one ? Or when they roll out a dessert cart to entice you with a tray of goodies that have been covered in varnish and shellac ? <p> So do I suggestively sell ? Nope . Unless there is a manager breathing over my shoulder , and then maybe I will ask if they want coffee . But ordinarily , no way . Most of the time , I just want them out of my station and if I suggest a hot tea they might say yes and then I 'll have to go fucking make it . 109837 @qwx969837

Today I am spending the afternoon working on my book proposal , because if you dream it you can acheive it . I know this is true because I saw it on a poster in my math class in seventh grade . Mrs. Fredrichs , you rock . Part of this post is a rewrite from about a year ago , but it still makes sense to me so I am using it again . I have been reviewing my old diaries to see how many freakin waiter jobs I have had in my life . I have every day of my life documented in my diaries since December 31st , 1982 . One entry stopped me cold in my tracks . Had I not written it in my own hand , I never would have believed that it was from me . It proves to all those naysayers out there that I have not always been a spiteful , bitter , angry waiter . There was a time when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and inspiration to serve others . Of course , this was before I was an actual waiter . I was just a lowly busboy dreaming of the day that I could be a waiter and reap the rewards of that position . Behold : <p> September 30 , 1989 : Worked tonight and made $31 . Cool , eh ? People tell me Im a great busser . I want to be a great waiter . I really do . <p> First off , yes , I was working in a restaurant in 1989 which is probably before half of you bitches were born . And yes , $31 was a decent sum of money to me back then when my rent was only $275 . It was a long time ago before cell phones , computers and I think it was right before they invented these flying machines called aeroplanes . But we must take notice of my aspiration to become a waiter and how I truly wanted to be a great one . I was working at a Mexican restaurant in Denver called Juanitas . Who even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for my future in the food service industry . There was one waitress there who always said " pardon me " when ever she walked by and I always thought it was so sophisticated of her . To this day , I say that instead of " excuse me " or " get the fuck out of my way . " I want to keep it classy . <p> I guess the point of this post is to remind us all that dreams really do come true . Jiminy Cricket says so and I do have him tattooed on my leg so it must be true . In 1989 I dreamed of becoming a waiter and I made it happen ! Therefore , if I can dream of writing a book , then I can make that happen too . I am a waiter .

@@106055599 @1455599/ <h> Category Archives : Charmin Bears <p> In an ongoing effort to keep this blog classy , today I have chosen a topic of discussion that will elevate our forum to a new level of taste and decorum : poop . It is certainly not the first time I have discussed this . How can we forget the unfortunate mishap of poop in the trash can or the story of thepoopy diaper left at the table ? Both good stories , indeed , but let us delve deeper into the dark brown mystery of pooing in public . <p> Last week , I had a moment that made me question every life choice I have ever made . It happened when I went into the bathroom to blow out the candles and close up for the night . When I opened the door , a wall of odor knocked me down and raped my olfactory system . That smell tied me up , gagged me , and had its unprotected way with my nose . Someone had way too many lentils in their diet and used our restaurant bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our toilet . I do n't  know about you , but I need optimum conditions for doing a number two anywhere else but my own home . There is a whole formula that goes into account before I decide if it is worth pooping in a public restroom : how badly do I need to go , what are the consequences of holding it , how clean is the bathroom , is it a single use bathroom , what type of toilet paper is there , what is the likelihood of people knocking on the door and most importantly , will the smell seep out of the bathroom and let others know what I was doing in there ? I know we all poop , but I still find it easier to pretend that we all do n't  . <p> I hate cleaning the bathroom at my job . When it comes time for that , a simple sweep with a dry broom is about as far as I am willing to go . My cheap ass manager wont spring for liners for the trash cans , so when its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a runaway tampon popping out to say hello . Its not easy to empty a trash can without actually touching it , but I have managed to do it with the use of multiple paper towel and good balance . One time the trash can rubbed up against my shirt and I just about fainted right there . The only thing that kept me from fainting was knowing that if I did , I would then end up actually touching the floor with my face . Seeing that I do n't  even like my shoes to touch the bathroom floor , my face touching it is not an option . <p> But there I was last week surrounded by the smell of hell . It was like a skunk made love to a rotten egg and then rolled around in Jennifer Lopez Live EaudeParfum Spray . I bolted out of the bathroom and looked for the offender . I suspected the cook but the dishwasher looked mighty guilty too . I took a deep breath and went back in to fill the soap dispenser and make sure there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released the breath and prepared to go back in . I took another deep breath and grabbed the candle and trash can . This process was repeated three times making me hyperventilate and wish that I was anything in the world other than a waiter who had to do a goddamn bathroom check at the end of the night . <p> I suppose some people can do a number two any time and anywhere and if it means they do it in a restaurant , then so be it . I 'm just not programmed for that . At my other job , I work with a guy who has no issue with it whatsoever . On my first day there , I walked into the bathroom where I found him standing next to the stall with his pants unbuttoned and his hands on his hips . " Bad news , dude . The toilets clogged and I just took a huge dump . " " Oh , okay , " I said . " Its nice to meet you . " <p> What a shitty job I have sometimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial for Angel Soft where the guy keeps yelling to his wife that they 're all out of toilet paper ? " Can you toss me a roll ? " he asks repeatedly . You know what , dude ? How about you keep the extra toilet paper in the bathroom instead of asking your wife to keep throwing it at you . Or better yet , go get it your fucking self , lazy ass . And also on the subject of toilet paper commercials , I am sick of seeing those goddamn Charmin bears who always have toilet paper dingle berries hanging off their asses . Hey ad execs : bears may shit in the woods but they do n't  use toilet paper and everyone I know thinks those commercials are disgusting . Stop it . 
@@106055601 @1455601/ <h> Category Archives : Houlihans <p> Restaurant managers are a curious breed . Do you think any of them grew up wanting to be a restaurant manager or is it something that just happened ? I was looking through an old journal last night and out of it fell a bev nap that was covered in writing . It was dated December 1 , 1994 and written while working at Houlihans in Times Square . It was mostly about my frustration with that particular job and the managers in particular : <p> " Is it the right thing to do when I get up every day and come to this dung heap of a restaurant ? And looking at the various managers flit-floating around reminds me that the life of a restaurant manager is empty . As empty as my pockets are after a typical shift at this joke of a job . " <p> I remember that we had a regional manger in the restaurant that day so everything had to be ship shape . <p> " And is n't it funny how they think that I care if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see their restaurants through a cloud of smoke . So sad for them to think that everyones silver is as clean as theirs . Or that everyones food comes out that fast . Idiots ! All of them . " * <p> I recall ringing in an order for the area manager and having to type in that it was a VIP so the kitchen would know to make it first and to make sure it was perfect . Meanwhile , the secretary at table 72 who comes in every other day has to wait for her salad longer than usual and no one will go through it to make sure that every piece of lettuce is pristine . <p> " But back to the ridiculousness of the restaurant business : it sucks . But the people you work with usually are very nice . However , the people you work for usually are very stupid . Power breeds stupidity . " <p> The words on that bev nap were written almost twenty years ago and it tells me three things ; Number one : things never change . Number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long fucking time . Number three : my handwriting is immaculate . <p> At a recent " mandatory meeting " at work . I listen to the owner saying things that I could have written down on that same bev nap back in 1994 . The corporate-speak and general bullshit that spews from his mouth is making me sick to my stomach and I find it hard it believe that he really thinks that what he says is inspiring to us . <p> " We all have to be on the same team , because if were not on the same team , it means we are fighting against each other . Our cart has to be going in the same direction . If my wheels are going one way and your wheels are going another , how will we ever get anywhere ? " <p> Really ? That is supposed to make me want to work harder for you ? There must be a high school guidance counselor somewhere who is pissed off because he is missing the inspirational poster from his wall . It sounds like it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitten hanging from a tree limb with the words " Hang in there ! " Managers could do a lot better if they would just talk to us like we are people and not cogs in their food service machinery . We are not stupid . We want the same things they want : plenty of customers , an enjoyable place to work and money . Inspirational quotes are not going to inspire us . <p> " My number one priority is you guys . I want you to be happy and I want you to make a lot of money , " he says . Do n't  lie to us . I would respect you so much more ( no , I would n't ) if you could be honest and say that your number one priority is that the restaurant makes a lot of money and you hope that trickles down to us . Do n't  blow smoke directly up my ass by saying you care about me when every time I make a suggestion you just dismiss it with " it sounds like you need more training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it this way in order for us to grow . " Just be honest and say , " Its my way or the highway . " At least then , I will know that you 're an asshole instead of you trying to conceal it with the touchy-freely crap you wrap up your ego with . <p> Bitter , me ? Sure , I am , because I know that so many other servers have to deal with restaurant managers who are exactly the same as mine . Yes , my job knows I write a blog . Does the owner read it ? I do n't  know , I doubt it . And if he does , I cant imagine that he made it all the way to the end of this post . Besides , the beauty part of me having three jobs is that I can always say it was n't about them , it was about my other boss . But my friends who I work with who read this will know exactly who I am referring to . <p> My apologies to the good restaurant mangers out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are an endangered species . <p> *Even back in 1994 , I was quoting musical theater .

All of them , " is from The Threepenny Opera . 109838 @qwx969838 <p> I hope you started your day with some pink hearts , yellow moons , orange stars and green clovers because today is St. Patricks Day . Yes , I am talking about Lucky Charms , natures perfect breakfast food other than Capn Crunch or Honeycombs . If you needed to have a warm breakfast , then perhaps you settled for a bowl of McCanns Irish Oatmeal and if you are a big ol lush , maybe you just sucked down a Guinness . If that is the case , do not feel bad about it , for today is St. Patricks Day and heavy drinking is not only expected , it is encouraged . Does anyone even really know what St. Patrick did ? He s a Catholic something or other and the only hard-core Catholic I know that would be able to give me the lowdown on the guy is probably on her fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Its been a while . ) Did he chase the rats out of Ireland or see the image of the Virgin Mary on a piece of Irish soda bread toast ? I have no idea . Maybe he turned water into green beer ? Regardless , today is the day that we all wear green and some people pull out their stupid ass " Kiss Me , I 'm Irish " buttons and we go around pinching people who forgot to wear the color of the day . We go to McDonalds for a shamrock shake and then we head over to Bennigans , Houlihans , or Maggie Maes Irish Pub to get as trashed as we possibly can because that is what St. Patrick and the Catholic church would want . We must honor that tradition , yall . Get trashed . And do n't  worry if you forgot to wear green . If you drink enough pints , your face will soon be the right shade . <p> When I worked at Houlihans , we had a big ass countdown clock one year counting down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 11:00 AM . Why people thought Houlihans was a traditional Irish establishment , I 'll never know . Are nachos and chicken fingers Irish ? Now that I think about it , I do recall hearing a story about how St. Patrick needed to feed a hundred billion people one time but all he had was one block of Velveeta cheese and a lone bag of Doritos . But miracle of miracles , he fed those multitudes nachos until they were satisfied . That is the power of St. Patty ! <p> I will keep this post brief because I know you are probably already drunk by now ( Marlene , call me ) and you are ready to go put on your leprechaun costume and run around looking for a pot of gold . I will be at work tonight serving all the drunk bitches in green but I will do it with a smile on my face . For that is what St. Patrick , the patron saint of nachos , would want . Happy St. Patricks Day ! <p> I was sitting on the sidewalk in Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line for an audition . Sure I was watching men pile crap into a garbage truck , I could smell the stench of someone who was probably sleeping in that exact spot a few hours before and the air was a little chilly , but it was all better than being at work . I was just two short blocks away from The Houlihans that I spent so many happy hours at so I want to tell a story of those days . <p> We used to have this bartender named Evy . She was grumpy , mean , a habitual liar and not a very nice person . I always managed to stay on her good side because if you did n't  , she would flat out refuse to make your drinks . You could be so in the weeds and then you finally run over to the bar to pick up your ten million pina coladas and they would n't be there . And Evy would say something like , " Oh I must have been changing the printer paper when you placed your order . Sorry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly learned to kiss her ass in order to make my life easier . We worked together for a long time and after a while all of her wild and fanciful stories seemed to be a little too wild and fanciful . It took me and the rest of my co-workers a long time to realize that she was making up shit left and right . One day she came into work with her head half shaved in this kind of mid-90s asymmetrical bob deal . It was not like her to have a hair cut like that so we all asked her what made her decide to go so radically different . She had an answer : <p> Well , I went to Las Vegas this weekend just because I thought it would be fun . So I was there with a friend of mine and we were at a bar . The bartender was totally ignoring us and I really wanted a drink so I told him that I was getting mad and I went off in him . The man next to us , turned to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vile person I have ever seen in my entire life . And I want you to be in my movie . So he cast me as a gang member with a bad attitude and he wanted me to cut my hair this way . So I did . Because I 'm gon na be in a movie . Me ! And I 'm not even an actor ! Isnt that crazy ? <p> It was at this point that we all started to realize that Evy might have a wee case of the pathological liar syndrome . Of course the movie deal fell through . Because it never happened to begin with . Her stories were always big . Like the time she went to a Knicks game and ended up in the VIP seats " just because " or when she was going to go to Paris next week " for the fun of it " but then it did n't  happen because something else came up . If she was a Facebook friend , her status would always be like , " OMG , just because I turned down Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate Middleton " or " I G scratch off lottery tickets . Just one $500 ! Again . " <p> I do n't  know whatever happened to Evy . I can " t even remember if she left Houlihans first or if I did . It was impossible to be her friend because you never knew what her real story was . All I knew to do was listen to her tales and nod enthusiastically so that when I needed something from the bar , she would just make it . Life was simple then . Good luck , Evy , wherever you are . To hear her tell it , she probably had plastic surgery , changed her name and got racial reassignment and is now living in the White House as our first African-American first lady . 109837 @qwx969837 <p> I have been called a fame whore . If that is what I am because I crave attention , fame , the spotlight , and more attention , then so be it . Have I always been this way ? Yes . Yes , I have . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . Over the years , there have been many ways that I have tried to get my mug on the television , from submitting to reality shows ( I was a semi-finalist for the very first Survivor , but they chose Richard Hatch instead ) to writing to the ladies at The View and asking if the next time they do a dentistry makeover show , can I please come on and get some new choppers . But the first time I tried one of these methods was way back in the early 90s when I tried to get on The Ricki Lake Show with my friend Corinne . <p> At Houlihans Corinne and I used to watch television and share breakfast together before the shift started . Egg and cheese on a roll from the deli downstairs . The same deli where I met Carol Channing . We saw that the talk show was looking for guests for a " My Co-worker Needs a Makeover " episode . Corinna and I hatched up a plan . We would submit her for a makeover because she wanted new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the show and left our story on their answering machine : <p> Ricki , my friend Corinne needs a makeover so bad . She always wears the same thing and she never wears make up or brushes her hair . Shes a pretty girl , but she needs help . Ricki , whenever we go out after work , she wears her uniform and its all covered with food and stains but she does n't  care . Ricki , my friend needs a makeover . Help ! <p> We hung up and thought " whatever . " A few days later a producer called us . This was in the days before cell phones so I du n no how they got in touch with me . I had an answering service back then or maybe a pager . It was so long ago they might have sent the message via Pony Express . But they wanted to meet us ! That day . Could they come to the restaurant right then and interview us ? Oh shit ! I ran over to Corinne and told her that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to look like she needed a makeover stat . Truth be told , Corinne is a very pretty girl . In no way did she need a makeover and she would never have gone out after work wearing her uniform , but this was The Ricki Lake Show . If the truth had to be bent a little , then we would bend it . We forgo seeing to our customers as we set out to get prepared for our interview . Corinne wiped off her makeup and wrinkled her uniform . She put her hair up in some ratty ass pile on top of her head and I think we put some honey mustard and other condiments on her clothes . They showed up about twenty minutes later . The producer was some chick who was about 25 years old and she had a big old Polaroid camera hanging around her neck . She interviewed us for about ten minutes as we continued to ignore the customers who were dying of thirst and starvation in our stations . This was television . Priorities , people . They snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to us . <p> They never did . It must have been crystal clear that Corinne just wanted a new outfit from Chicos or TJ Max and I just wanted to be on television . She probably saw right away that Corinne did n't  need a makeover and they moved on to the next batch of potential guests . We were crushed . As the week ended and we realized that our dream of meeting Ricki Lake was not going to happen , our lives slowly went back to normal . We kept watching The Ricki Lake Show each morning and sharing our egg and cheese on a roll , but it never quite tasted the same as it did before Ricki Lake reached out and dangled a brighter future in front of us . Its okay . Corinne and I will always have Houlihans. 109837 @qwx969837 <p> One of the best things about working in a restaurant is usually the people you work with . Granted there are always a few folks who you could do without , but for the most part the co-workers are one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips that allow you to pay your mortgage and buy food goes without saying . ) How many of us have stayed at a job way longer than we should have just because all of of our friends worked there ? I worked at Houlihans for two and a half years or so . About eighteen months of that was just because I had so much fun with friends like Jane , Randie , Corinne and Kim . ( Hello ladies , if you 're reading this . ) The thing is , I have not worked at Hulis for over ten years and I am stillfriends with the people I met there . That says a lot about co-workers , right ? On the other hand , sometimes its the c0-workers who drive you away from a place . <p> I worked at a restaurant called Josies once for about two weeks . I du n no what it was with all the women who worked there , but most of them were totally rude to me . They werent helpful and they acted like they did n't  have room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I start a job , I am nothing but nice . I am quiet , never curse , never complain and friendly to everyone . In fact , after I have worked someplace a for a few months someone always tells me , " Oh my God , you are so different than I thought you were when you first started . " In other words , they thought I was sweet , but they figured out I 'm a bitch . Anyhoo , there was this one chick at Josies ( let 's call her Evilene ) who was so mean . On my first day there , I was wandering around downstairs trying to find the locker room to put my stuff in . I saw a door that was cracked open and poked my head in to see if it was the right place . Evilene was there putting her shirt on . " Oh , I 'm sorry , " I said . All she was doing was buttoning up her shirt but she acted like I just walked in on her while she was taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is someone in here ! I do n't  know where you grew up , but when you see a door closed , you knock on it first ! " I apologized again and kinda laughed . " I was n't even sure if this was the locker room and since the door was cracked open " She interrupted me . " Well , here we knock first , okay ? Got it ? " What a bitch . It was a fucking communal locker/store room . It was my first day . Get over yourself . Like I really wanted to see her in her bra and panties . When I quit two week later , I told the manager that one of the reasons I hated it there was because Evilene was such a bitch . <p> At Houlihans we changed clothes in the middle of the fucking dining room as we ate breakfast . We liked each other . We made each other laugh . It was what kept us all there . We were a family like a giant tree branching out towards the sky . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , growing wiser . We are growing free . We are a family . The point is that no matter how crappy your job is , you can usually find something good about it and nine times out of ten , its the people you work with . Okay , all together now : awwwwww . <p> ( Bonus points to anyone who can name the two musicals referenced in this post. ) 109837 @qwx969837 <p> I am on vacation so you are forced to read this old tired summer rerun of a post . If I can pull myself away from the cocktails , I will write something new . In the meantime , this is all there is . My apologies . <p> xo , The Bitchy Waiter <p> Someone posted something the other day ( shout out to Rebecca ) that made me remember an event that happened years ago . She was mentioning that age old custom of giving your tables a survey or comment card to fill out to ensure that they had wonderful service and enjoyed their crappy pre-cooked food . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they want to complain about something . No one ever takes the time to really compliment you on these things except on very rare occasions . The little forms suck , but there is a way you can make them work for you rather than against you . It just takes some effort . And stamps . <p> When I was working at the now defunct Houlihans in lovely Times Square , we were always busy with tons of tourists who came into the restaurant because of its familiarity . Do n't  ask me why anyone would get into an airplane and travel hundreds or thousands of miles and then end up eating dinner at a place that is also in their local mall . But people did . I guess once you 're in New York you get so homesick that you need nachos and Sysco food products . Now we did n't  have comment cards or surveys there but plenty of times people would ask to speak to a manager in order to complain about the quality of food or their service . It was always surprising to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ideal or that they thought the service was sub-par . Cmon . Its Houlihans . In Times Square , for fucks sake . Of course everything there will suck ass . Eventually I had had enough of people dissing my service . Granted , my service sucked , but I was sick of bitches telling my manager about it . I devised a plan . A very special Bitchy Waiter plan . <p> One night I typed a letter from a " customer " that praised my serving skills . I went on an and on about how I went above and beyond their expectations . How I recommended what they would like the most on the menu and then how delicious the food was . I even wrote some fake ass bullshit about how good I was with their children and how I made them laugh and finish their veggies . I also wrote that I suggested which Broadway shows they would enjoy . Basically , I said that I was an angel sent from Heaven so that I could serve at Houlihans . I then put that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Houlihans . Then I put that envelope into another envelope and sent it to my friend who lived in Georgia and mailed it to him . When Ron got the letter , all he had to do was drop it back into a mailbox so it would be postmarked Georgia and no one would ever suspect that I wrote it about myself . <p> A few days later , the letter appeared . My manager was elated . She was so proud of me that she stapled the letter to the bulletin board so everyone could see what high standards they needed to live up to . I was the superstar waiter of Houlihans Times Square . Only a couple of people knew that I wrote that shit myself while most people just could n't believe that someone would write that about me . But there it was in black and white and hanging in the kitchen . And it was postmarked from Georgia so it must be true . The letter stayed there for a few weeks . Best of all , my manager rewarded me with a $50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost me was about ten minutes of time and two stamps . It really is one of my proudest moments . My manager would be so disappointed if she knew the truth . There was no family in Athens , Georgia who loved me . I 'm sorry , Gladys . But thanks for the free food . 109837 @qwx969837 
@@106055602 @1455602/ <h> Does Anyone Still Wear A Hat ? While Waitressing ? <p> Summer is upon us and the humidity level is creeping higher and higher . Here on the East Coast , the weather is a crazy thing to me . Having lived here for 16 years I am still not used to the fact that in the winter it can be 5- and then in the summer it can be 95- . What the hell kind of place is this ? And I do n't  care what people say about it not being the heat but the humidity . If its 95- its fucking hot no matter what the humidity level is . The reason I 'm so flumfluxxed about the temperature is because I have to wear a uniform to work and that uniform is black pants and a long sleeve black button up shirt . You try wearing that and walking into the depths of holy hell that we call the subway and try to stay fresh for more than three minutes . Its impossible . When I get off the train and get to work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my uniform to work in a garment bag , but really ? A garment bag that carries a stain covered pair of pants and a faded dress shirt ? Not worth it . Or I could fold it and carry it in a bag , but really ? And then get to work and have to wear a stain covered pair of pants and a faded dress shirt that is also wrinkled ? A true dilemma . So what do I do ? I wear it and and turn into a big hot sweaty mess and then serve my guests looking like a tired dried up French whore who just gave a blow job in a sauna . <p> At my last job , I could wear whatever I wanted which was a good thing for about two weeks . And then I realized I was getting all my real clothes stained with coffee and grease and I started longing for a uniform again . I do n't  know who came up with the universal uniform for restaurant folks to be khakis , but that 's what it is most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Eyed Pea were all khakis . I have spent about 13 years of my life being forced to wear Dockers and Gap pants . <p> My big issue with a uniform is when the restaurant requires you to wear a certain article of clothing but they make us pay for it . That pisses my shit off . If I have to wear that ugly ass burgundy shirt , Mr. Houlihans , I do n't  want to pay for it . Same thing with you , Mr. Black Eyed Pea . I have to buy the green shirt with the stupid ass embroidered logo ? Or sometimes they will give you one shirt but if you want another it comes out of your paycheck . Fuck that . I will take the one free shirt and wear that bitch every day until it has so much food on it that it walk itself into the restaurant and start picking up shifts . <p> If I have to wear a uniform , I want to wear one that has some personality . I want a little hat and an cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big starched white collar and white sneakers . I want bright red lipstick and a beehive . Basically , I wan na be Flo from the television show Alice . I have written about her before and I have even been her for Halloween .

Does anyone still weara hat ? 109837 @qwx969837 109836 @qwx969836 <h> 22 thoughts on " Does Anyone Still Wear A Hat ? While Waitressing ? " <p> When I used to bartend in New York , this one place made us all go buy three bright yellow dress shirts from BROOKS BROTHERS . And made us bring in all three to prove we bought more than one and would n't be wearing the same nasty shirt every day . You ever bartend in a bright yellow dress shirt ? That shit does n't last very long . <p> i agree with you on the weather here on the east coast hot is hot and hot pluss humidity is miserable ! i 'm a western gurl , i like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fucking hot no matter where your at ! <p> Never seen my waiter or waitress wearing a hat and you 'll never see your nurse wearing one , unless it 's an old dried out 80 year old shoulda retired but we keep her for the novelty factor ! ! I agree if they wan na MAKE you wear it , then they should BUY it , not you ! ! Hell , they can have it back when ya move on ! ! *L* ( sorry , imagining the nastiness of THAT ! ) What do they think you 're gon na do with these fashion masterpieces ? ! <p> Would n't be nice if servers could have the linen service press and starch . Damn that would be nice . Everyone would look so sharp and neat . Locker room with showers too . go with clean pressed uniforms . Fantasy I 'm sure . I ate at Lowery 's in Chicago recently and I could swear our lovely server was wearing a little hat thing . This was after many spirits so I could be mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just for common sense sake Why does n't the restaurant have uniforms according to the seasons ? Is there some health law that u have to wear long sleeves 365 days a year ? As far as those hats , that is crazy a cool do rag would be nice . <p> Working in a kitchen quite a bit , I 've had to sweat it out year round in the past since then , I 've moved on to retail sales .. so the corporate giants have deemed all black shoes , black slacks , and ( preferrably long sleeve ) light blue dress shirt the appropriate work attire . Kind of sucks when I 'd been unemployed 7 months , feel lucky to get the job , then told that I have to come up with a uniform out of my own pocket . Thank god for mom 's department store credit card.At least we 're not forced to wear the over-priced ones they offer with a logo that we 're forced to pay for with our own check card/credit card , because the cheap fucks wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjure up the olfactory memory of fried-grease embedded in every polyester fiber of the two-tone brown pants suit uniform I used to wear doing food service at the University of Minnesota back in the 1980s . No amount of Tide could get out that smell . It was awful . Oh , great now I remember the cockroaches , too ! P.S. You 're a good writer , BW . Thanks for making me laugh . xo <p> Hey Bitchy , I 've been reading your blog for a while . Started first by reading " Girl and Guitar " and then followed her link to you . I 've been a restaurant groupie for years ! ! And now I 've got like four kids in food service ! Shit ! What the suits never seem to realize is that the front-of-house " glad rags " that they make the waitstaff drape themselves in are an important part of their marketing message . Say what you want about someplace like Hooters , for example , but at least their marketing message is consistent . I swear if I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tux shirts and black pants or skirts are almost as bad . Positioning is what it 's all about in business to make your product offering stand out . Even the simplicity of whites and a contrasting apron , like red , green , or even orange , says more than a stupid-ass polo shirt ! Do n't even get me started on jeans and a logo 'd tee-shirt ! Can we tell the staff from the customers ? Anyhoo , I enjoy your blog a lot and congrats on Blog of Note.Bdrumr56 <p> I 'm on the east coast too . This weather SUCKS right now . The kicker at my restaurant is that we wear short-sleeve polos. no matter how cold it is in the wintertime . We 're not allowed to wear a black long-sleeve underneath , nothing . I get so fucking cold at time I stand in the grill line trying to warm up . And ironically enough , my word verification is " i caring " <p> At Hooters , we have to buy all our uniforms ( save for the one black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . That 's right , we have to buy all of that from Hooters : tank , shorts , nylons , sock , pouch , shoes . That totals to just over $70 a uniform . Seriously . Now , I 'm not having to buy all parts of the uniform at once obviously , but it 's still expensive . I probably buy nylons an average of once a week , maybe every two if I 'm lucky . At four dollars a pop that shit adds up . But I guess I signed up for it , right ? <p> " I wear it and and turn into a big hot sweaty mess and then serve my guests looking like a tired dried up French whore who just gave a blow job in a sauna .

As I sat in the Target parking lot trying to decide if I should give them my hard-earned gay dollars , I thought , " what would Jesus do ? " And I decided that Jesus would forgive and forget and drive his sandal wearin ass over for some chicken . And so I did . And it was good .

I heard my flight being boarded but all I cared about was that ham and cheese on the sourdough bread so I ignored the plea for all customers for flight 351 to go to gate 18 .

She placed it at the table that I chose and when I was done eating someone else came and cleared my table . These Chick-fil-A bitches were giving way better service than I ever do . It was heaven . I had it again a few days later at a mall and when I sat down with my food in the food court , one of them Chik-fil-Aers came up and gave me some Purell to clean my hands . So classy .

Maybe more people ate cereal than usual and then you baked a cake which took a lot of milk and before you knew it , you were out of it ? That happens in restaurants too .

She gasped when I told her . " Oh . My . God . I loved that salad . How horrible is that ? ? " She looked like she was gon na cry . This was a few weeks after 9/11 . I paused .

Her uniform was about the same as Hazels but Hazel was a busy body who was always getting up in Mr. Baxters business . Alice never did that . Rosie the Robot was a pretty good maid , but she often needed repairing and replacement parts that George Jetson was responsible for . The only time Alice ever needed anything cleaned out , her boyfriend Sam the butcher took care of that . Florence Johnston was a horrible housekeeper and all she ever did was give Mr. and Mrs. Jefferson sass and attitude up on the East Side . Would Alice ever give lip to Mike or Carol ?

If you do n't  know who he is , then shame on you and may you be cursed by a tiki idol . Maybe the phrase " the youngest one in curls " will jolt your memory . Sherwood Schwartz created the best , most endearing and beloved television sitcom in the history of the world , The Brady Bunch . And as if that wasnt enough , he also created Gilligans Island . The man was clearly a genius who was able to pry open the minds of Americans and see what they wanted to watch on television . How else was he able to produce two shows that although ridiculed in the beginning have managed to remain on the air for over 40 years ? <p> Thinking of the passing of Mr. Schwartz brings to mind episode #74 of Gilligans Island , " Where there 's a Will , Theres a Way . " Its the one where Mr. Howell writes a will and leaves everyone on the island a fantastic gift after his death . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , your average everyday rich people stuff . Well , then Mr. Howell gets all paranoid that everyone wants to kill him so they can hurry up and get their bequeathment so he goes into hiding . While running through the jungle , he narrowly escapes some quick sand and then he gets an idea . He places his hat on the quick sand so that when the others find it , they will think he was swallowed up into the earth . Of course the Skipper finds it and they give him a funeral but Mr. Howell is hiding in the tree watching what everyone is saying about him . It is then that he realizes that the other castaways loved him and not just his money . As he wipes tears from his eyes , the tree branch breaks and he falls onto the ground ruining his secret . Everyone gathers around him saying how glad they are that he is alive . Its one of my favorite episodes on Gilligans Island because it actually deals with a very serious subject in a **44;603;TOOLONG kind of way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : you better look up into the trees and make sure his sneaky ass is n't sitting on a branch watching you cry for him . I would n't put it past him , that crazy Sherwood Schwartz . <p> So , We say thank you to Mr. Schwartz for filling our childhood afternoons with laughs and silliness . His shows served as our babysitter , our friend and our teacher . He taught us lessons that we use to this very day . For example , when you want to back out of a date , you simply have to use the excuse " something suddenly came up . " He also taught me the entire story to Hamlet thanks to episode #72 of Gilligans Island where movie producer Harold Hecuba visits the island and they write their own musical version of the play . <p> Cmon , that 's some fucking brilliance right there . But most of all , Sherwood Schwartzs shows taught us to enjoy life . Every single episode of Gilligans Island and The Brady Bunch had a neat tidy ending where everyone was happy and life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they still gave us a hope that we too could find happiness in our every day life . If Ginger Grant could be happy at the end of an episode where she is almost thrown into a volcano , then should n't we be able to find some joy in our life ? <p> Rest in peace , Sherwood Schwartz .

I was but a wee bitchy waiter then just learning how to carry trays and give attitude to tables .

Now I do n't  know how much money Mike Brady was paying her ass , but it had to have been more than she was making at The Golden Spoon Cafe ( at Fourth and Oak ) . They only show her working one shift at the cafe but there are only a few tables in there and unless she is working 100 hours a week , it ai n't  gon na cut it . Plus all of a sudden she had to start paying rent and buying groceries . She had it pretty good at 4222 Clinton Way when she was living with the kids . True she had to clean up and cook for eight people but she had her own room , did n't  pay rent and got to eat all the leftovers she wanted .

Kay is all business and wont even play a game of basketball with the boys when they ask her to . What a bitch , that Kay is . One day Greg , Marcia , Peter , Jan , Bobby and Cindy all go to the restaurant to check on Alice and ask her to please come back home with them . And of course she does . She throws her apron off and hugs them and is so excited that she got her old job back and off they go , leaving The Golden Spoon in a lurch because she was the only waitress and she just leaves in the middle of a shift .

I du n no , maybe she can talk to Mr. Foster and pick up some shifts at The Golden Spoon . <p> The fact that Alice left her waitress job to go back to the kids says a lot about waiting tables . Waiting tables must really really suck if she chooses to be a fucking maid for all those people ( and Tiger too ) rather than sling hash at The Golden Spoon Cafe . Waiting tables ai n't  easy .

@@106055614 @1455614/ <h> Category Archives : Reichen Lehmkuhl <p> Admittedly , this has absolutely nothing to do with waiting tables , but I have written about it in the past and I need to follow up on it . Months ago , I wrote a post about my arch enemy , reality television star Reichen Lehmkuhl . He was in the same restaurant I was in just a few days after I had written a bad review of the off-Broadway show he was in . Someone got all offended by the posting so I responded with a Comment on Comments . The defender of Reichen had this to say : <p> He s more famous for being admired for his military service and gay rights advocacy , and rise from total poverty , and less of a famewhore , like a waiter who is trying to get people to look at him forbeing a waiter and a bitter queen . <p> Well , yesterday , some pictures were squeezed out on to the Internet of Mr. Gay Rights Advocacy . Although he has proudly served our country , starred in reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry line and wrote a best-selling book , the pictures represent none of these things . Instead he is sporting a full-on erection and posing for a webcam . And I 'm the famewhore ? I 'm not even famous . I will not show the pictures here because they are offensive , degrading , demeaning , demoralizing and shameful . Also , my mom reads this . So click here if you really need to see Reichens lehmkuhl . It is NOT safe for work . ( I know all you hussy bitches are clicking away so fast that your keyboard is smoking . ) <p> Okay , that 's it . I just had to write this because there were a shitload of Reichen Google searches that came to my blog yesterday and they needed to be acknowledged . Carry on . Carry trays . <p> Last week , I ruffled a feather when I wrote about Reichen Lehmkuhl . You can read the original post here or the follow-up post here . I never intended for the post to become anything more than a brief mention , but when something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing it up . A friend told me that when he was watching Reichens new reality show on Logo , The A-List , Reichen mentioned a couple of reviews that he were written about his performance in his off-Broadway debut My Big Gay Italian Wedding . As it turns out , one of the reviews he read out loud was the one written by me . And I thought it was pretty cool . <p> And this concludes my blogging about Reichen Lehmkuhl. 109837 @qwx969837 <p> Every now and then , I like to pull a comment that ruffled some feathers and respond to it . Normally , I let things roll off my back because I am such a calm and easy-going kind of person . My post about Reichen Lekmkuhl really upset one Anonymous person and it was just crying out for a response . <p> Anonymous said <p> I have a Google alert for Reichen and that 's the only way I was led to your sorry blog . He s more famous for being admired for his military service and gay rights advocacy , and rise from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waiter who is trying to get people to look at him forbeing a waiter and a bitter queen . You should read Reichens book . You are truly ignorant of this guy . I saw his play and it was hilarious . I look at the good in life . I 'm sorry such a good accomplished guy had to be so close to your miserable company . <p> Ouch , Anonymous . That really hurts my feelings . I have to say Reichen is not more famous for his military service and gay rights advocacy , neither of which I intend to diminish . But let 's be honest . We had never heard of him before he won the fucking reality show , so in truth that is what he is famous for . I called him a famewhore , this is true . Then you tried to insult me by calling me one too . Guess , what . I already admitted that about myself in that same post , so I 'm rubber you 're glue . Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks right up your ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Does n't  he have another reality show just about to start and in all the ads he s in a bathing suit ? If you do a Google image search of Reichen ( here , I 'll do it for you ) , you see a lot of him with his clothes off . I do n't  really see him in his military uniform and doing book signings that often . Not that I blame him for posing in his underwear all the time . If I looked like that , I 'd be naked all the time too . Hell , I would never buy clothes again . And about his play ? Sorry . I did n't  like it . It aimed for the lowest common denominator to get laughs and relied on heavy stereotypes . I read several other reviews that agreed with me . His acting was a bit wooden but I commended the way he looked in his underwear as did almost every other review that was written . And as for you feeling sorry that such a good guy had to be so close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Reichen for being in the same restaurant as me . He does n't  know me . He did n't  know I was there , and I am sure that his evening was not spoiled by the fact that he was in close proximity to me . In fact , I am fairly certain that he was not affected at all . Hell be fine . <p> Thanks for the comment , though . I always love when I am able to push a button in someone and make them want to write out a sentence or two to share their thoughts . Thank you for exercising your first amendment right by saying whatever the hell you feel like saying . That 's what I do too . On my blog : The Bitchy Waiter . <p> I had an awkward moment the other night and I 'm not talking about the usual awkward moment I have when I put on my apron and think " what the hell am I doing with my life ? " It was a different awkward moment . <p> I went to eat at a restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written about him before and kinda raked him over the coals a little bit when he closed the place I worked and dumped us all with no warning . I wont say what restaurant I used to work at because that would be totes unprofessional . But I went to his other place to eat because I like the food and sometimes I know someone there who will give me some free shit . As soon as we walked in , we noticed that Reichen Lehmkuhl was having dinner there . Does anyone know who he is ? He won the reality show The Amazing Race a few years ago and has parlayed that success into some quasi-level of celebrity . He s a total fame whore and will do anything for attention if he thinks it will make him a little bit more known . ( In other words , exactly like me ) He was doing a play here in New York City recently and I wrote a review about it because its one of my many fucking jobs that I have . He was pretty bad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So there I was a just a few feet away from this man whom I had said was a bad actor but looked really good in his underwear ( not unlike me . ) He did n't  know who I was and there was no chance he would realize that I was one of the people who had reviewed him so poorly , but it was weird . <p> The hostess took us to our table and then I saw John , the owner of the restaurant , at the bar . Seriously ? Now there were two people in this place who I had totally reamed online ? I had heard that the owner knew I had trashed him on my website and here I was just three feet away from him and hoping that someone would give me free food ? Awkward . I slid into the booth as quickly as possible so he would n't see me . It would have been very embarrassing to have been asked to leave because my mouth was watering for a chicken chilaquilesand a gingerita . He never saw me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me or did n't  give a shit . After a few sips of tequila , I did n't  care anymore either . <p> Reichen eventually left never knowing of course that his bad reviewer was so close by . I suppose the only way he will ever know is when he sees this posting . You know his ass has a Google alert that tells him whenever his name goes on to the Internet ( again , just like me . ) But I started to think about my reckless behavior and how immature it is of me to spout off things about people and then just post it on the Internet . Hey , maybe I am being irresponsible . Maybe I 'll grow up and try to really think about what I write . Hey , maybe Ill dye my hair . Maybe Ill move somewhere . Maybe I 'll get a car . Maybe Ill drive so far theyll all lose track . Maybe Ill sleep real late . Maybe I 'll lose some weight . Maybe I 'll clear my junk .

Its every servers worst nightmare . It happened at some Ash Wednesday event where she was speaking . If Ash Wednesday events in Germany involve drinking pints of beer , then sign me up for a Catholicism right away , because I had no idea . From what I know about international politics ( nothing ) the Chancellor of Germany is the head of government much like the Prime Minister in Great Britain , the President in the United States and Shift Leader at Applebees . <p> youtube LONG ... <p> According to reports , the waiter is named Martin and he was taking the beer for another server who was too nervous to carry the tray .

He has been quoted as saying " I was shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was too late . " After reviewing the tape , I do in fact see a man in a dark suit squeezing past Martin and it appears that the mans back bumps into the tray . However , it seems to me that the five beers were already on their way to say hello to Ms. Merkel before the man made contact with the tray . In my opinion , the server was carrying the tray in an impractical way . Why is he letting it rest on his forearm ? Poor form , Martin , poor form indeed . <p> Chancellor Merkel takes it like someone who is used to having beer poured all over her . Maybe she was once a St. Pauli Girl and beer on her back is as common to her as a margarita is on mine .

And what about the blond on the right-hand side of the screen who is all Miss Kiss-Ass and rushes over with a napkin and then hands her a new beer ? Bitch , please , nobody likes you , we can tell . My favorite response is the chick at 19 seconds who 's face is saying , " Whatever , not my problem , I want some bratwurst .

A few days ago I went to a restaurant that is pretty well known here in the city . I wont say the name of it , but let 's just say it is owned by an Iron Chef . Uh huh . Iron Chef . Needless to say the food was delicious . The mashed potatoes were so good that I wanted to order a tub full so I could soak in them , sink to the bottom and then eat my way out . I also had a double baked potato that made my toes tingle . Yeah , I ate two carbs . The food was so good there that I even liked the collard greens . Ordinarily I do n't  touch a vegetable with a ten foot breadstick , but these were so good that I actually enjoyed them and did n't  have to just swallow them whole with big gulps of water . My steak was perfect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake was a slice of heaven . Despite the brilliance of all this wonderful food , there was one thing that stood out even more . Our server , Maria . Let a choir of angels sing the freakin hallelujah chorus , because this girl was good . She was one of those servers that makes you want to come back again and again . I mean , even if the food was just adequate , Maria would have made the food taste even better . She was that good . Always there whenever we needed something , never rushed us , recommended certain items , laughed with us , asked us our names . I kinda fell in love with Maria that night . I was so impressed by her service , that I was inspired to ask her if they were hiring , because maybe The Bitchy waiter could step it up a bit and work in a non-dump for a change . She told me they were hiring and to drop my resume off on Monday . Cue the choir of angels again . <p> On Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resume and headed to my future place of employment . I asked the host if I could see Claudia , the lady that Maria had told me to ask for , but the host said she was in a meeting and would give her my resume . Curses . I really wanted to meet this Claudia woman so I could pour on the charm , but instead I thanked Hostess and went on my way . About an hour and half later while walking down the street , guess who I bumped into . Maria . ( Angels sing again . ) She was all , " Oh my God , you have to apply ! " and I was all , " Oh my God , I just dropped off my resume but they would n't see me ! and she was all , " Oh my God , go back ! " So I went back . I told the hostess ( a different one now ) that I was in earlier and really wanted to see Claudia . " I 'm sorry , she 's in a meeting but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wont do . I explained to Hostess #2 that I really wanted to work there and I know they are hiring and I know I can do great . And then I told her that I had just bumped into Maria and I was taking that as a sign that this was meant to be . Hostess #2 agreed that this was surely an act of God and went to find Claudia at once . Success ! She would tell Claudia how eager I am and that Maria and I had experienced serendipity and everything would fall into place . Three minutes passed before Hostess #2 reappeared . Without Claudia . My hopes were dashed . But Hostess told me that Claudia appreciated my story and she would be calling me . We shall see . I think its meant to be . I really do . Stay tuned .

If I were a baby bird , I would want to live in it . I bet it smells like pine trees , magnolia blossoms and patchouli . <p> Your ass is even more incredible . It looked like two hams . I have never seen a pair of Dickies so perfectly filled . <p> You kept my fries warm . I saw what you did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and the burger was n't there yet , you held that plate directly under the heat lamp until the rest of my food was ready . I do n't know how you did that , because those heat lamps must be about a thousand degrees , but you somehow managed it . I noticed that- when you brought the food to me , your fingers were callused and burned and you did that for me . You sacrificed your own fingerprints just so I could have hot french fries . I took a picture of it so I would never forget how much you did for me . ( My only regret is that I cant see your ass in the photo . ) The next time I am feeling sad or down , all I will have to do is look at that photo to be reminded that there are good people in this world . <p> Thank you , John Stamos . It is not often that I come across a server so willing to go above and beyond for their customers but you have proven that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiter in the world . I can only hope that other people who read this horrible blog will know that not all servers are as awful as The Bitchy Waiter . He waited on me once and I swear to God it was like he did n't even want to be there . He can certainly learn from you , but he probably wo n't because he is too drunk , lazy and far too much of an asshole to ever admit that he could be a better person . ( He also needs a haircut . He looks like a fucking scarecrow who stuck his finger in a light socket . ) <p> I wish all good things to you , John Stamos . I know I will never experience any server as amazing as you but I am grateful that I sat in your section . 
@@106055623 @1455623/ <h> Category Archives : hurricane sandy <p> In case you have n't heard , New York City was hit yesterday with a bitch of a hurricane named Sandy . The only way you would n't know about this is if you live under a rock or a bridge like a skanky gutter troll , so yeah , maybe Springs1 has n't  heard yet . Anyway , its pretty bad around here . Trees are on the road , there are millions of people without any power and the subways are not running because there is more water in the tunnels than there is in a Jack and Coke at a dive bar . It is a time when you really learn to set your priorities in order like food , water and survival . However , if you are the general manager at 5 Napkin Burger in Hells Kitchen , your only priority is to get that restaurant back open so you can serve some damn hamburgers ! <p> I was contacted by a reader , who shall remain nameless since we do n't  want to get him or her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napkin . It was sent by the general manager last night at 8:00 PM , which is pretty much when Sandy was at the height of her bitchiness . It alerted all hourly employees to expect to open the next day . So while buildings were falling apart and tankers were being washed ashore , this asshole was all about " how can I sell some more bacon cheddar burgers . " This morning at 11 ; 45 , they got another email telling them that since the subways are not running , to take a cab in and they will be reimbursed the money . I was told that this was the same offer given to them during last years Hurricane Irene and they are still awaiting that reimbursement money . <p> Hey , 5 Napkin Burger in Hells Kitchen : have some fucking compassion , assholes . Most of your employees probably do n't  even have fucking electricity so how in the hell are they supposed to iron their uniforms before they show up to work . Do you really want a bunch of wrinkled servers taking orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since there were 90 mph blowing through their apartments but sure , you wan na sell some Lobster Roll Sliders , so by all means force your employees to figure out how to get to work . <p> Its really a double-edged sword for those if us in the restaurant industry because if we do n't  work , we do n't  make money . As much as someone would want to stay home and pump the Hudson River out of their bedroom , maybe they need to go to work so they can make a few dollars to replace all the food in their fridge that is spoiling since the power has been out for 18 hours . Being a waiter is n't like working on salary in an office where if the place shuts down , you 'll still get paid . When restaurants close down , we lose money and we do n't  get a chance to make it up . We cant claim a personal or vacation day because for most restaurant workers , those are as foreign as 401Ks and pensions . <p> Maybe the right thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servers were able to make it to work and how many of them wanted to do so . Its just plain asshole behavior to demand attendance the morning after New York Citys worst storm in the history of ever . I get it : 5 Napkin needs to make money . I also get that some servers would want to be there if they could . But there has to be a balance of business and compassion . If your employee says he s not going to be able to make it into work because of a natural disaster unlike anyone proceeding it , then you just have to buck up and say , " Well , well do without you , but as soon as you can get back to work , well be ready to have you . " If the mayor of New York City is telling people to stay home unless they absolutely must go out , I do n't  think selling french fries is enough of a reason to change his mind . <p> To my friend who has to go to 5 Napkin today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to make it to work or your boss changes his mind . If you do go to work , I hope you make shitloads of tips and if you end up staying at home I hope missing out on another day of tips does n't  put you too far into a hole . And speaking of a-holes : 5 Napkin Burger . <p> Please share this , so maybe it will make it to the manager at 5 Napkin Burger on Ninth Ave . 109839 @qwx969839 <p> With all the hype on the East Coast about Hurricane Sandy , I ca n't help but write about anything else . It does not seem right for me to complain about that bitch who sat in my station the other night and just about how had a coronary when I told her we do n't  take American Express . <p> " But what about my points ? ? " she exclaimed ? <p> " What about the barrier islands in New Jersey ? ? " I replied . <p> Or how can I justify writing about the man who asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I like it cooked a lot , but its not like I want it burned , you know ? " It seems trivial to respond to such an inane request when the future of residents in certain low-lying area of Brooklyn is so unsure . <p> In the face of the storm , I do n't  feel comfortable telling the story of that little boy who freaked out that there was bacon in his mac and cheese even though it clearly states that fact on the menu and I assumed that his parents knew how to read . This kid acted like a scorpion had crawled into his diaper and had an orgy with some fire ants . His parents did nothing about the tantrum except tell me they were going to need another round of drinks for them to be able to " handle the kid . " So , no , I wont write about that . <p> What I will write about is how we on the East Coast are dealing with the storm . According to Facebook , almost every friend of mine has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Maybe . Vodka ? Yes . Canned soup and tuna ? Possibly . Doritos and donuts ? Of course . It is 1:00 PM here in Queens and the winds are starting to pick up . The clouds are heavy and the rain is beginning to fall . I am still in pajamas but I might put some clothes on soon to go to the store for another essential need : bacon . <p> For anyone who is reading this who is in the path of this bitch Sandy , please be careful . Do n't  take any chances and if you must go outside for something ( taco shells , beer , a dog walk ) make sure you watch those tree limbs . Those sneaky bitches are always falling down on someone and messing things up . I leave you with a You Tube clip about the original Sandy : the one from Grease . Below that , you will find a recipe for the Hurricane because if you do n't  have batteries , you probably have rum . <p> youtube LONG ... <h> Hurricane Cocktail <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark rum <p> 2 oz passion fruit juice <p> 1 oz orange juice <p> Juice of a half a lime <p> 1 Tbsp simple syrup <p> 1 Tbsp grenadine <p> Orange slice and cherry for garnish <h> Preparation : <p> Squeeze juice from half a lime into cocktail shaker over ice . <p> Pour the remaining ingredients into the cocktail shaker . <p> Shake well . <p> Strain into a hurricane glass . <p> Garnish with a cherry and an orange slice . 109839 @qwx969839

A year ago and I still remember what this asshole looked like . <p> The Bitchy Waiter <p> My first day at my new job went off without a hitch with the exception of one huge asshole who sat at table 24 . Do they follow me ? Am I an asshole magnet ? My fellow co-workers were shocked that this guy treated me the way he did . " We never get people like that . I am so sorry you had to deal with him . " Poor me , destined to deal with assholes no matter where I work . I may as well be a fucking proctologist . <p> So this place I work at now is pretty nice . Did I mention we have candles ? Yeah , candles . Most of the folks that come in for the shows are prepared to drop a pretty penny for the cover charge and the two-drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fat ass at his seat . I gave him the shpiel about how he had to have two drinks while there and how helpful it would be to tell me both of them now so as not to interrupt him during the performance . " Do you gots Bud Light ? " Being new to the job and seeing that he had a list of beers in front of him , I paused and told him I was n't sure . I looked at the list and said , " No , sorry just Amstel Light and Sam Adams Light . " He informed me that he would have an Amstel Light . <p> " Alright , sir . And would you like that for your second drink as well ? " <p> " I du n no . " Long pause as he stared at me . " I 'll tell you what I do want though . Get the biggest glass you have . Fill it with ice . Then fill it with water . Then put a lemon in it . I want two of those right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he calls me again . " Do you have any food ? " I suppose he does n't  understand the purpose of the menu sitting in front of him . <p> " Yes sir , we do . I have hummus and pita chips , spinach artichoke dip- " <p> " No , no no . Food . Real food . " <p> " That is food sir . We do consume that . " <p> " Meat . Do you have any food that is meat ? " <p> I was staring to hate this guy . " Then no sir , we do n't  have any food . " <p> " What kind of food do you have then ? " <p> I have now crossed the line from starting to hate this guy to actually hating this guy . I reiterated our food options and he finally agreed on the cheese plate and then berated me for not knowing the price without looking at the menu . He almost choked when I told him how expensive it was , but he ordered it . The table next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to ring in his order . He yelled out to me he also wanted a shot of Jack Daniels . When I brought out his beer , shot and two waters ( which he never touched ) he told me he needed a Coke chaser and he was not paying for it because where he comes from you just automatically get a Coke chaser with a shot of Jack and he was not paying for it and he would not be paying for it . Got it , ass . Fine . <p> Halfway through the show he leaves his seat to come to the bar and complain that he is dissatisfied with his cheese plate . He was not paying for a plate of crackers with one piece of cheese . He would not be paying for it . Got it , fine . Meanwhile the other server went to retrieve said cheese plate and showed him several pieces of cheese that were still on it proving that it did have more than one piece as he claimed . " Well , I do n't  like swiss ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  know what those other cheeses are ! " ( They were gouda and brie . ) I guess he just did n't  recognize his old stalwart cheeses of American , cheddar and Whiz . <p> We took the cheese plate of his bill . After the show , he walked around the room talking to some of his friends and ignoring me as I waited to accept payment . About fifteen minutes later I hear the other server calling after him as he walked toward the door . " Sir , are you going to pay your check ? ? " Asshole laughed . " Oh my Lord . I totally forgot about it . I 'm sorry . How much do I owe you ? Hardy harhar . " <p> I ran his credit card and you know what the asshole did ? On a $49 check , he left me ten bucks .

@@106055627 @1455627/ <h> Waiting on Ginger Grant , the Movie Star <p> Today is Tina Louises birthday . I do n't  know how it is possible , but she is 80 years old today . This is for her . <p> While recently dining out with friends , the topic of work came up and of course everyone started to tell horror stories about their jobs . Everyone who has a job has a horror story and if you work at Hooters , you might actually have a whore story as well . Someone asked me who was the most famous person I have ever served while waiting tables . After thinking about all my brushes with celebrity greatness , I decided my answer was Sally Field , leaving one Miss Katy Perry out in the cold . There were other servers in the mix and I thought that no one else could have possibly waited on someone more famous than Sally Field . But someone did . <p> " I once waited on Tina Louise , " said Joann . <p> My mind froze . As Joann told her story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep valley of jealousy I had just fallen into . I saw Joanns mouth moving but all I heard was the sound of my own tears falling onto the table . They were tears of anguish , frustration and envy . Why , God , why ? Why cant I have the good fortune to wait upon someone as wonderful as Tina Louise . All I get is lame ol two-time Academy Award winner Sally Field . <p> For those of you not in the know , Tina Louise is the brilliant actress who brought to life the role of Ginger Grant , the movie star , from televisions Gilligans Island . She is gorgeous , genius and ginger . As Joann told the story of her experience with the actress , I drifted off into my own world and imagined what it would be like to wait on her myself . <p> TL : Listen , I can see that you are enamored of me and why wouldnt you be ? I played Ginger Grant on one of the most amazing television shows of all time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me very badly , but all I want is a tuna nicoise salad with no tuna . <p> BW : Yes , maam , of course . Where did Ginger Grant get all of her fabulous clothes ? Why did she pack so much for a three-hour tour ? <p> TL : Well , one of the dresses she made from the sail of the S.S. Minnow and the rest she had in her luggage . Now , may I get some water with lemon ? <p> BW : Did you ever do it with the Professor ? <p> TL : The professor was an asshole . He was a horrible horrible man and I 'm happy I will never have to talk to him again for as long as I live . I 'm done speaking about this now . <p> BW : Ooooh , I hit a nerve , did n't  I ? Do tell . If you give me the dirt , I will comp you a slice pf coconut cream pie . <p> TL : Hmmm , I do love me some coconut cream pie . Okay listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , okay ? <p> BW : Of course ! Its not like I have a blog that I 'm gon na run home to and then post this entire conversation or anything . Duh . <p> TL : Yes , I loved him . Ginger Grant loved the Professor just like I loved the man who played him , Russell Johnson.We had a hot and fiery love affair and they were writing it into the storyline when all of a sudden he dumped me without any explanation at all . After that , the writers had to develop a new storyline for our characters and that is why the show was eventually canceled . <p> BW : Really ? That 's why it was cancelled ? I thought it was canceled because it was so fucking stupid . I mean , do n't  get me wrong , I loved it , but cmon . It was dumb . <p> TL : We ran for three years and for the fourth season , there were big plans to shift the focus of the show from Gilligan to the relationship between Ginger and Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and had the writers scrap the idea for the season four . The next thing I knew , the show was canned . It was going to be my ticket to the Emmy award I always deserved and then the next step would have been movies where I could have gotten an Academy Award . Yes , I loved Russell and Ginger Grant loved the Professor . We made love on hammocks and we fed each other coconut cream pies while Natalie Schafer watched . Our love was hotter than the volcano they tried to throw Gilligan into in episode #98 , " Gilligan the Goddess . " That was our last episode , by the way . And its Russells fault ! RUSSELLS FAULT ! ! ! <p> I happen to know Tina personally , and all emotion and profanity aside , there are about 20 different things in your story that make it obviously false and invented , which anyone who had actually spent more than 10 seconds with her would spot immediately . <p> Its pretty sad that you have to completely invent things to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for knowing Tina . I think its pretty obvious that the story is made up . Namely the part that says , " I drifted off into my own world and imagined what it would be like to wait on her myself. ( insert harp music ) " <p> Is it me or does the troll above kind of creep you out that all these years later he , who knows Tina " personally " , is stalking stories about her via the internet ? The woman is 80 , and yet.he continues . <p> This is where the theme song titled " You Need to Get a Life " should begin to play . <p> Anyone , and everyone with a brain , realizes this is just a parody and a funny one at that . No one thinks for a second that any of this is real or that Ms. Louise would actually behave in this manner . My gosh , did he miss that part that it was a made up DREAM ? <p> I love that Mr./Ms " bite me " up there can read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the story that give it away as false , yet completely miss the ENTIRE SENTENCE that says it is IMAGINARY ON PURPOSE . That is comedy gold right there . <p> I love u bitchy and all ur stories ( real and imaginery ) . Been in the business my whole life . Wish I worked with u . Would be too fun . Just started a new job at one of the best restaurants in my beach resort town . Maybe I will experience some crazy stories to share . God knows I have tons from my last job .. thanks , ur new server friend Kim 
@@106055629 @1455629/ <h> Monthly Archives : September 2013 <p> I am still on vacation and we continue with this lousy " Best of Bitchy Waiter " bullshit . Of course I have to repost this classic about Michael Cera because it is the most viewed post ever in the history of The Bitchy Waiter . It really stirred things up and made for great comments about what an asshole I am for writing about it . It really brought out the ire in people , especially chefs who said theyd rather have a famous person like Michael Cera sitting in their restaurant and playing chess than a no-talent hack blogger like me . But fuck them . I am reposting anyway . <p> Famous people live by their own set of rules . I do n't  believe its necessarily because they are all horrible people but because they live in a bubble where people never tell them " no . " They probably surround themselves with " yes men " who are there simply to confirm that every decision they make is a good one even if its not . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delusional and the people around them allow it to continue . <p> I am going out to dinner in Brooklyn to a great place called Buttermilk Channel . They are known for their fried chicken which is served on a waffle , but me , being the purist that I am , can only enjoy fried chicken when it is of the nugget variety so I always opt for a hamburger . It is a Tuesday night and they are slammed as always . There are three of us and we put our name on the list and begin our wait . We are told it will take about fifteen minutes , but I can see that the restaurant is full of two-tops so its going to be a while before two two-tops leave at the same time opening up a place to push two tables together for the three of us . The bar is full as well , so we stand on the sidewalk . We are in no hurry and take the time to catch up on our lives and appreciate the late summer weather . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with menus in hand but she escorts another group of people to their table . We continue to wait , which is fine . We understand that it is a busy night and people are sitting at all the tables and enjoying their delicious fried chicken . After another twenty minutes , its our turn . The hostess leads us to a table in the back of the restaurant and as we walk through the dining room , I habitually survey the situation to see how things appear to be going for those at work . All the tables are full and the servers are busy but smiling . The hostess leads us to our table but right before we get to ours , I notice something unusual . I see a four top-that has only two people at it , a man and a woman , which is a bit surprising seeing how full the restaurant is . That is not the thing that is so unusual though . The two people at the table are playing a game of chess . They have rolled out a portable plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit . <p> " Who the fuck thinks its okay to play chess in a busy restaurant ? " I ask my friends as we sit down . " And why the hell is the restaurant letting them do that ? Thats fucked up . " <p> We sit down and look at our menus , but the conversation quickly turns back to the Bobby Fischer wannabes at the table next to us . " Thats shitty , " I say again . " They are taking up a four-top to play chess and we waited for a table for forty fuckin minutes . Who the hell does that shit ? " <p> " I think I know who the hell does that shit , " says my friend Jane . " Look who that guy is . " <p> I focus my attention to the guy at the table and I see a young hipster-looking dude who is drinking a cappuccino and holding a rook in his hand as he stares at his rolled out chess board . He looks familiar and I try to recognize where I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did I used to work with him ? Was I his babysitter once ? Who is he , how do I know him ? " <p> " Isnt that the guy from Arrested Development ? " says Jane . <p> " Is it ? I cant tell . " <p> At this point , Chess King says something to his Chess Queen and I instantly recognize the voice of George-Michael Bluth . Michael Cera is sitting next to us and he is taking up a four-top so that he can play fucking chess . <p> " We waited for forty minutes so George-Michael could play chess ? Awwwww , hell no . Lemme get my phone out and take a picture of this bullshit cause this right here is a fucking blog post . " <p> I reach into my bag and tell my husband to lean over so I can make it look like I am taking a picture of him when really I just want photographic evidence of a celebrity taking advantage of his celebrity . <p> Michael Cera <p> We watch George-Michael finish his game of chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are at the restaurant for an hour and when we leave , he is still playing chess . It blows me away that a restaurant would let anyone , no matter how famous they are , take a up a table for that long in a busy restaurant when they are n't  even eating . That 's what Starbucks and your own fucking living room are for . As we leave , I approach someone who works at the restaurant . ( I told this person I would not give away their identity . ) <p> " Hi , " I say . " Can I ask you a quick question ? " <p> They oblige . <p> " I write a blog about waiting tables . Its called the Bitchy Waiter- " <p> " Wait , you 're The Bitchy Waiter ? ? Oh my god , I love that blog ! ! " <p> I resist the urge to turn the conversation to more about myself and say , " About that guy playing chess at the table back there . " <p> The employees eyes roll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you guys are so busy . What kind of person does that ? " <p> " Someone who has never worked in a restaurant , that 's who . " <p> I am told that he got there at 6:30 PM . It is now 9:30 PM . <p> " Did he eat dinner ? " I ask . <p> " He ordered mussels a couple of hours ago . " <p> I give my business card to the employee and promise them that this will be a blog very soon and leave the restaurant . <p> Michael Cera has no clue that there was anything wrong with what he was doing . In his world of celebrity , he has made it okay in his brain to use a busy restaurant as his own personal game room No one at the restaurant wanted to tell him that he needed to wrap it up because the restaurant does n't  want to take the chance of pissing off a famous person and risking that they will never come back again . So the cycle continues . Celebrities make self-involved decisions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the same thing . I thought about giving him one of my business cards as I walked out so he could read about how his selfish behavior affects others but I did n't  . However , I did write this blog post about him and maybe , if he has a Google alert on himself like I do , he will get an email that will alert him to this blog . If you are reading this , Michael , please pay attention : <p> It would be fine to take up a table in a restaurant for three or more hours if you were using that table to eat . It is not cool though to sit there and play chess all night making other people have to wait even longer for a table . I suppose it could have been worse though . You could have played Risk or Monopoly and that shit would have taken even longer . No one told you what you were doing was wrong because they did n't  want to upset a famous person . But I am telling you now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chess for three hours , do it where everyone else does ; at your own home or at Union Square . Its rude , famous or not , its rude . <p> I hope you will share this so perhaps it will eventually fall into the lap of Michael Cera or one of his people so he can learn the error of his ways . <p> Okay , this post did not do well the first time it went up so it can hardly be considered a " Best of Bitchy Waiter . " However , I really liked it and thought it was worth putting up again . And since its Saturday and I am on vacation , I plan on having a big juicy steak tonight . <p> As I lead the two customers to Booth 9 , I surmise that the booth may be too small to accommodate their rather large frames . They look at it and ask to sit at a table . I am embarrassed for not thinking of this sooner , but I am so accustomed to people clamoring for a booth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman seems to have already been drinking but it does not stop them from ordering a bottle of red wine . After the wine is poured , I take their order . <p> " I want a New York shell steak , black and blue , " says the man . " Tell the cook to just sear it on each side and out it on the plate . I do n't  mind if its still mooing when it gets here . " <p> The woman smiles at me , revealing purple teeth proving that she has in fact already had plenty of wine earlier , if not moments before , then continuously for several years . <p> " I 'll have a blue cheese burger medium-rare with no bun and no fries , but with a salad instead , " she slurs . <p> I step over to the computer to ring in their order and watch as they reach across the table and fondle each others hands . At first , it seems rather sweet but after a few minutes it looks more like molestation than affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb-battle rape situation and she is staring into his eyes with the intensity of the Death Star . They suck down the wine , never breaking their stare . <p> When I place their food before them , I fear that the steak is going to be over-cooked , for Juan tends to think that people do n't  really want their meat rare . The man cuts into the steak and I watch blood and juice spill out onto the plate and swirl around in a pool of not-well-doneness . <p> By this point , the lady seems trashed . Her face is flushed and she very often stops eating to rest her chin on her hands . She manages to eat all of the burger but I notice that the man has eaten only half of the steak . Then , I watch as he takes the steak and slides it onto her plate . It drips with blood and he tells her to eat it . She does . <p> She picks up his steak knife and cuts off a huge portion of meat and slowly and seductively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of his . She crams the big piece of meat into her pouty little mouth and begins to chew . And chew . And chew . I alert one of my co-workers to the show . We are watching some kind of ritualistic red-meat foreplay and the man seems to be quite enjoying it . She begins to swallow with great difficulty , tilting her head downward and moving her closed fist to her mouth with her eyes closed . <p> " Is she choking ? " my friend asks . <p> " I hope not , because I do n't  know the Heimlich , do you ? " <p> " Well , there 's a poster about it in the side stand-wait , she 's okay ! " <p> She swallows hard and then looks up at her Man Meat and smiles to show not just purple teeth but a need for a case of dental floss . <p> " How was it ? " he asks . <p> " Soooo good . I want more , " she says and she cuts off an even bigger piece of beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this for real ? " asks my co-worker . <p> We watch as she struggles to get the piece of meat down , ignoring any gag reflex she may have once had . She again closes her eyes and looks downward , covering her mouth once more with her hand that is now covered with meat juice . Once the meat is down her food pipe , she takes the final swig of wine in her glass . She tugs at her sweater to achieve a sexy off-the-shoulder look and then pulls her bra strap down exposing a bare shoulder with an angry red mark from where her bra strap had been . After a few minutes of no more ingesting , I go to the table and ask if they are finished . <p> They are . I remove their plates and offer dessert , but I have a feeling that dessert will be had later this evening and it wo n't involve anything on our menu . They ask for the check and I give it to them , minus the steak because I know it was not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ways . He is very generous with his tip ( that 's what she said ) and I am happy that it has all worked out . <p> He gets up and goes around the table to help his Meat Eater to her feet . She leans on him and the two of them stumble out of the restaurant on their way home to some corpulent copulation . <p> I imagine that when they get home he says something like , Show me again how you took all that meat . " <p> I am on vacation and since I was too lazy to write anything in advance and too lazy to ask for guest bloggers , I have decided to do a " Best of Bitchy Waiter " for a few days . ( Totally lame , I know . ) As you read this post , just know that I am in Miami on South Beach drinking frozen cocktails and trying to tan my pasty white body . <p> The scheduling Gods smiled down on me last week and granted me a Saturday off . When the schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see my usual days off . However , since I had volunteered to work on Labor Day , I was rewarded with a Saturday off instead . When I saw the word " OFF " on a Saturday , my jaw dropped to the floor that I was supposed to have mopped earlier that morning but did n't  because it seemed pretty clean already and why not just make the lights a little dimmer instead ? After I reinserted my eyeballs into their sockets , they glazed over at the thought of doing regular Saturday morning things like all those other people who have " real jobs . " Brunch , maybe , or shopping . Or brunch ! <p> I thought it might be nice to spend the day on Governors Island which is only a short ferry ride from Manhattan but a world away . I had never been there before because it is only open on the weekends . Once I looked at their website and determined that they were open and that they did indeed serve cocktails , it was a done deal . Onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through Buttermilk Channel and into a world of island adventure . Once there , I discovered that there was an vintage French carnival happening with with French music piped in through speakers on the tress . Old fashioned carnival rides were everywhere and surrounding that were buildings housing art installations . Further beyond was a massive field with a free miniature golf course and a food court . There were old forts and castles to explore and bicycles to rent and live musicians and food and gift shops . It was truly like being in another country and if not another country , at least it was not Queens . <p> After some exploring of the island , it was time to quench my thirst and I found a place that had cocktails all made with Chambord , you know , since its French and shit . The Chambord Lemonade was exactly what my parched throat needed ; Chambord , Vodka and fresh-squeezed lemonade . My empty stomach thanked me for the drink and within minutes , my buzz was nice and rolling , much like the hills before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listened to a woman sing in French , the smell of pommes frites filled my nose holes and I knew that before cocktail number two , I needed some of those fried potatoes , so I went to the line at the food counter . <p> The line was long and I went to the front to ask if they took credit cards or cash only . I saw a woman standing at the front of the line holding her baby . She was a young woman , nicely dressed and attractive , but her behavior was quite the opposite of her appearance . She was angry and yelling at the woman behind the counter . <p> " No , I want leg of lamb . You fucking told me that it would be ready at 5:00 and its not . " <p> " Yes , maam , I know , but its not ready yet . " The counter worker was calm and professional . <p> " I have been standing in this line for too damn long and the only reason I waited was because you told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking ready . I do n't  appreciate that . " <p> " Maam , I understand that , but its simply not ready . What else would you like ? " <p> " I 'd like some leg of lamb . " <p> " Other than that , what can I get you ? " She rattled off the available items which included several other option , none of them being leg of lamb . <p> The woman went bat-merde crazy . " Fuck this bullshit . I want to talk to the person over you . " <p> " That would be the chef , and he is busy . " <p> " Then I want to talk to the person over him . " <p> " Youre talking to me , maam . " <p> I could n't believe that this lady couldnt let the lack of lamb go . It was a beautiful day , the weather was perfect , its Saturday and were on an island in the river and there are worse things that staring at the water on a Saturday . <p> " Fuck this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am in management and when something goes wrong I accept responsibility for it . That 's what I do . Are you accepting responsibility for this ? Are you ? Cause you told me you 'd have fucking leg of lamb and now you do n't  . " <p> Meanwhile , her baby looked bored like it was thinking , " Here we go againmy moms being a bitch . " <p> " Yes , maam . I accept responsibility . " Listen , my crew has been here since 8 AM . We took our first break at 5:00 and we will be here until 1:00 tonight . We stopped to eat and things took a little longer than we expected . " <p> " Thats not my problem , how long you 've been at work . I waited in line for forty minutes for leg of lamb and now I 'm not getting any . " <p> I stood there and watched that poor woman behind the counter and felt sorry for her that she was being verbally dumped on by this woman . And then I remembered something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Excuse me , " I said to Lamb Lady . " You 're holding up the line complaining about something you 're not gon na get . Why do n't  you just choose something that 's available and chill the fuck out , lady ? " <p> She turned her venom at me now . " If you do n't  like it then you can go get in another fucking line ! " <p> Another woman turned to me and said , " In her defense , they did tell her it would be ready and she 's been in the line for a really long time . " <p> " THERES . NO . LEG . OF . LAMB . Let it go . Move on , " I bellowed . " Is yelling at someone gon na make it cook faster ? Its alright to curse at someone ? And while you 're holding your baby ? Maybe youd like the lamb now and you can just eat it raw . " <p> " Fuck you , " she told me . <p> I looked at her and saw her as every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my right hand and flapped my fingers to the thumb repeatedly as if I had a puppet on my hand . " Blah , blah , blah , " I said . " Get over it . " <p> She gave up her fight and stomped away from the line , sans leg of lamb . I gave a smile of support to the woman behind the counter and then decided that fries were no longer needed but a cocktail was . <p> I went back to the bar area to get another Chambord Lemonade and continued watching the live musicians . My drink was cold and the sun was warm . I felt good about my day off and even better that I was able to put a customer in her place . Why do people think they can mistreat those who serve them ? I think its because they know that we cant fight back unless we are willing to lose our job . People like this Lamb Bitch take advantage of the situation and use it to make themselves feel better about their lot in life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should know that no one wants to be treated the way she was treating that woman . It felt wonderful to be able to stand up for that woman who was being screamed at . It felt great to tell a customer , although not mine , to chill the fuck out . I felt satisfied . I took another sip of my Chambord Lemonade and listened to another Edith Piaf song and gave thanks for my Saturday off . 109839 @qwx969839 <p> Light the candles ! Get the ice out ! Roll the rug up . Its today ! Though it may not be anyones birthday , and though its far from the first of the year , I know that this very minute has history in it , were here ! Those lyrics are from a musical ( who can name it ? ) and not only do they describe today perfectly , they are also the lyrics to the opening number of The Bitchy Waiter Show coming to you in 2014 . <p> Today is September 25th which is known around the country as National Food Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mothers Day or Fathers Day or Flag Day or Arbor Day ? We care about National Food Service Employees Day ! As you- trudge into into your restaurant I want you to hold your head up high . Pay no mind to your apron that is crusted over with dressing and pay no heed to your shirt that you should have ironed but did n't  , for today is the day that everyone will recognize your significant contributions to society . I suggest that every restaurant print out a flyer that reminds people about this auspicious occasion so that customers ca n't put their money where their mouth is and dig into those pockets a little bit deeper . <p> On this day , I hope that your managers are extra nice to you , but in turn , you must be nice to them as well . After all , this is n't National Servers Day , its Food Service Employees Day . That means , its for everyone you work with from that stupid ass hostess that does n't  know how to rotate seating to the dishwasher who gets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours after you leave . Everyone needs to be nice to each other . I do n't  mean you have to give group hugs in the walk-in and go down on each other in the bathroom , I just mean that we should all realize that we are all in this hot honey mustard mess together . <p> I shared a special restaurant edition of a Bingo card yesterday on my Facebook wall but I am going to repost it here . I think today would be a most excellent day to play Bingo . Come up with a prize for the winner . It could be anything ; maybe the winner does n't  have to roll silverware or maybe the winner is the first one who is cut . Just make today at work as enjoyable as possible . <p> Have a happy day , friends . And please share this blog post so that the world knows to be nice to our asses today . 109838 @qwx969838 <p> " Hello , " said the lady as she pushed her stroller back into the restaurant about ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did anyone turn it in ? " <p> Her husband stood behind her looking either irritated or constipated , I 'm not sure which . Seeing that he had just had me as his server and eaten food cooked by Juan , it could be either one . <p> " I have n't seen one , no . I 'm sorry . Are you sure you left it here ? " I asked . <p> " Well , I gave it to my son to play with and he was holding it when we left . I think he dropped it out on the street and I thought maybe someone would have brought it back here . " <p> Sure , lady . Because whenever someone finds an iPhone on the street , they just take it to the nearest restaurant . That 's how this world works . Like , if you find money on the street , you take it to the nearest bank and then they find the rightful owner . Uh huh . <p> " I 'm really sorry , but no one has turned one in . If you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call you if we find it . " <p> " Like someone is really gon na find it and then turn it in , " said her husband . <p> I silently agreed with him and wondered why they thought it was good idea to let a two-year old child use a $500 phone as a toy . <p> People leave things in the restaurant all the time . One thing that I have found a few times is a cane . This is very odd to me . If they needed a cane to walk into the restaurant , did they not need it to walk out ? Do I work in a place that has magical healing powers and it makes people not only not need a cane anymore , but it also makes them forget that there was a time , only an appetizer and an entree ago , that they were slightly crippled ? <p> " Can I leave my number in case someone finds the phone and turns it in ? " the lady asked me . " Its worth a shot , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied . <p> Her husband- continued to look angry and when I looked down at the stroller , I saw that the child was now holding an iPad . Because if your child is too young to take responsibility for an iPhone , then by all means , give him an iPad too . <p> " Okay , I 'll write down my contact info . Umm , I do n't  know any of my phone numbers without looking at my phone . Honey , " she said to her husband . " What 's your phone number ? And let me look at your phone so I can see what our land line is . " <p> The husband handed his phone to her , which I noticed was a Blackberry . <p> " Honey , I du n no how to work a Blackberry . Can you just look up and see what our number is ? Oh , wait , I 'll just give them my email address . " She looked at me . " That way , if you find the phone , you can email me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email until I am at home or the office . Honey , I 'm going to give them your email , is that alright ? What 's your email address ? " <p> " The phone is gone . You 're not getting it back . Let it go , " he said . <p> The kid continued playing Candy Birds or Angry Candy or Crush the Fucking Angry Birds or whatever the hell they thought was good for his four-year old brain . <p> " Just tell me what our land line is , " she spat out through clenched teeth . <p> She jotted the number down on a bev nap and they left . I went to the bulletin board and placed the note there right next to the other notes that no one would ever pay attention to , like the one that said " No cell phones on the floor " and " Kevin needs his shift covered . You owe me , guys ! ! " <p> It is doubtful they will ever see that iPhone again but since they seemed to learn nothing , I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step into their dry cleaners and ask if anyone turned in an iPad that their son was playing with when they were in there the day before to pick up some shirts . 109838 @qwx969838 <p> We in the world of restaurants are used to working varied schedules each week . For many of us , our days off are different each time the schedule is posted and its sometimes hard to make plans far in advance without putting in the ever-important " schedule request . " Luckily for me , I have a set schedule at both of my serving jobs which allow me to plan ahead but that has not always been the case.When a day comes up that you need off and you are scheduled to work a double you have no choice but to ask someone to cover your shift for you . Do you want to trade a shift or just give it away . Most of the time , you hope to trade it so that you do n't  lose the money , but when times are desperate , you get to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , you may even agree to pay money to someone to take your shift . There are usually the go-to people who are always broke and will always take another shift . We love them . However , if they cant take your shift off your hands it gets complicated . You have to find someone else who is willing to work for you but then not hold it over your head that you owe them your firstborn child . We know those people right ? <p> " I can work for you , but if I do you will definitely owe me a huge favor . " <p> Fuck you . I do n't  believe that when someone works for you you owe them anything . They may be doing you a favor , but its not like they are doing out of the kindness of their bacon-wrapped heart . That person is working it because they want extra money . Its not like you are asking someone to work for you and then at the end of the night they put all the tips they made into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick it up when you come back to work the next day . <p> I recently got a text message from a co-worker , who thankfully does not read this blog . <p> It said : Hey , its Kevin from work . Do you think you can cover 9/27 , 4:00 to 10:00 ? Its my birthday and I was hoping to get it off . Please let me know . <p> I wrote back the next morning : I am so sorry I just got this text message . I am going out of town that day and not getting back until the day I have to go back to the restaurant . <p> He immediately responded with : Well , its good to know all those covers I 've done counted for not even one reciprocation . <p> Followed by my response : So you want me to just cancel my plane tickets ? I 'm sorry I ca n't work for you but I have two other jobs which allow me to pick up a shift only on Tuesday but the restaurant is closed that day . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town that day ( watch out , Miami ! ) and I worked it around my schedule so that I wo n't have to ask anyone to cover for me while I am gone . Kevin may have worked for me once in the past , but I was n't aware that that meant I now owed him any kind of favor . I was under the impression that the $125 he made that night working my shift two months ago when I was away at a funeral was payment enough . I have three jobs so no , I do n't  have the ability to pick up shifts like some other people . Kevin thinks just because I am only at this particular restaurant a couple of shifts a week , I spend the rest of my time eating bon-bons and waiting for people to offer me leftover shifts . <p> So , no , Kevin , I can not work for you on Friday the 27th . When your shift starts at 4:00 I will be on vacation . We land in Miami at 1:00 so by 4:00 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slathered my self with sunscreen , found a chaise lounge next to the pool at The Raleigh Hotel and ordered my third or fourth frozen daiquiri . Have a happy birthday though . I will think of you that night when you are watching the clock and waiting for 10:00 to roll around so you can punch out and begin your birthday festivities . I will raise a glass in you honor . I will , raise it right up your ass , if you 'd like . <p> Happy birthday ! 109838 @qwx969838

I du n no what it was with all the women who worked there , but most of them were totally rude to me . They werent helpful and they acted like they did n't  have room for another bitch on staff so they wanted me out . When I start a job , I am nothing but nice . I am quiet , never curse , never complain and friendly to everyone . In fact , after I have worked someplace a for a few months someone always tells me , " Oh my God , you are so different than I thought you were when you first started . " In other words , they thought I was sweet , but they figured out I 'm a bitch . Anyhoo , there was this one chick at Josies ( let 's call her Evilene ) who was so mean .

Evilene was there putting her shirt on . " Oh , I 'm sorry , " I said .

I do n't  know where you grew up , but when you see a door closed , you knock on it first ! " I apologized again and kinda laughed . " I was n't even sure if this was the locker room and since the door was cracked open " She interrupted me . " Well , here we knock first , okay ? Got it ? " What a bitch . It was a fucking communal locker/store room . It was my first day . Get over yourself . Like I really wanted to see her in her bra and panties .

@@106055635 @1455635/ <h> Category Archives : poor <p> So I have learned one of the downfalls of working in a performance space as opposed to a restaurant . On a slow day at a restaurant , you may get fewer tables and get cut early and make less money than you had hoped . In a performance room when you serve cocktails , if no one schedules a show that night , you just lose your shift . Yeah , just lose it . I get it . What singer wants to have show on January 3 when everyone blew their wads over New Years weekend ? Nobody , that 's who . So usually there are three shows on Sunday and today there are no shows . No . Shows . No customers . No tips in my pocket . I swear to God , I looked in my wallet the other day and a moth fucking looked back at me and said " get the fuck outta my house , bitch .

I was with friends a few days ago ( yeah , I have a couple of them ) and we wanted to go have a cocktail .

We thought it would be funny to go to the bar and have a drink there all the while making fun of the fact that we were in a fucking Olive Garden . We went to the door and it was locked .

The kitchen has 86d half of the menu because things are incredibly busier than usual . There are large parties in your station and everyone is only half-paying attention to you because their mind is on some other fun event that is happening just outside your workplace , . You are n't  able to participate because , you know , you have to be at work while it appears that everyone else in the city is off that day . You are holding a tray full of waters when you slip on a lemon that you knew you should have picked up but did n't  , and you spill the glasses of water down the front of your apron soaking your pad and all of your money .

That server , who thought the day was as crappy as possible , suddenly realized that he is lucky to be alive . Why does it take some monumental tragedy to remind us to be grateful ? <p> We lost a lost that day , including the lives of three people ; eight-year old Martin Richard , a Boston University student and a 29-year old restaurant manager named Krystle Campbell . People lost limbs and people lost blood but worst of all , people lost their sense of safety yet again . The Boston Marathon will now forever be tarnished because some crazy person wanted to prove a point . From now on , there will always be a moment of silence at the start of the race for those who lost their lives on Monday . Moments of silence or wonderful but would n't it be better to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more reasons to have moments of silence . <p> What can we take away from this ? Hopefully , we will gain an appreciation that will make up for some of what was lost . The people directly involved will hold onto that day much longer than any of us who werent there will . They will never forget what they lost that day , but maybe we can try to keep it with us too . Sure , it will fade away as all things do , but would n't it be nice if we could never forget what was lost so we can always hold onto the appreciation of now ? The next time you are at work and someone sends back a cup of coffee for the third time because it still is n't hot enough , maybe you can just be grateful that all you will lose is the time it will take to make an extra trip to the microwave to nuke that cup for three minutes . <p> What happened in Boston is just another senseless act of violence that we hope we will never get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sometime down the road , but until then , let 's not let ourselves worry about the little things that are bothering us . Instead , be happy that you are alive and that you have a job , no matter how crappy it is . If you do n't  have a job be grateful that you have legs to walk on and if you do n't  have legs be grateful that you have eyes to see and if you are blind be grateful that you have breath . We have to remember that there is always something to be grateful for . If a customer leaves you a bad tip , be grateful they are gone and you can continue your day being happy .

On it was a giant picture of a cartoon pig along with the words " Porky : Servicing the Food Industry . " Now maybe I am just a dirty minded old man , but when I hear the word " servicing " I imagine someone on their knees providing oral stimulation to one of their dear close personal friends or a stranger they met in the bathroom of a Chipotle Mexican Grill . So of course , I went there . My mind conjured up an image of a line of waiters , bus boys , kitchen crew and managers all patiently waiting for their turn with someone named Porky . Now I assume what this Porky company actually does is provide food supplies to restaurants , but to me Porky just presents the wrong image . I cant help but think of the 1982 classic film , Porkys . ( Since it was released way before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the way . ) But if I called Porky Products to enquire about the cost of some frozen chicken fingers and the receptionist answered with a perky , " Thank you for calling Porky , how can I service you ? " all I would be able to think about would be that scene from Porkys the movie when Miss Balbricker is holding onto that guys penis through a hole in the girls bathroom . I 'd have to stifle a giggle and then hang up , because , yes , I really am that immature . <p> I also wonder how this company has managed to have a big cartoon pig as their logo and not have the fiery breath of Warner Brothers coming down on them for defiling the image of Porky the Pig . I would think they would come down on them so fast that Porkys ham hock ass would spin . A few years ago I was selling on eBay some painting of various Monopoly cards and I got a cease and desist order from Parker Brothers . <p> I was only selling these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers all over my ass . But Warner Brothers does n't  care that there is another Porky the Pig out there ? And instead of stuttering , this Porky sells slabs of bacon and ham ? And that 's another thing . I do n't  want to see a cartoon pig selling me real pig . Its gross . Its like the pig is saying , " Hey , I 'm a pig , so fry my bacon ass up and serve me with a side of grits and some eggs . Or you can take my rump and put it in a slow cooker for dinner . Or why not slice up my rinds and put them in a bag and eat them the next time you are watching World Class Wrestling or NASCAR ? I 'm the other white meat ! " <p> Okay , enough . I just had to get that out of my system . Th-Th-Th-Th-Th- Thats all , folks . And speaking of pigs .

That 's nice too . <p> Dear Bitchy Waiter , <p> I work in a restaurant , have been doing the classic rollup for years . The problem is the flap hangs out and does n't  always keep the silverware tight in the rollup . There was a person I worked with who rolled the silverware so that everything got tucked into the rollup , so it would n't come unwrapped . I cant remember how he did it ! ! ! ! : ) Do you know how to do that ? If not , where should I look ? Signed , David <p> Dear David , <p> I do know of this secret technique you speak of . Are you referring to the one where all the corners of the napkin are somehow practically invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then carried to a drawer or bin ? The technique was taught to me by a Buddhist monk who lived in a cave in the mountains of the Himalayas . He was on a 40 year vow of silence and all he did was eat , pray , and do rollups . I went to this guru once so he could show me the art of mastering the rollup . Unfortunately , I made a solemn swear to him that I would only pass on his technique to people who worked with me and could volunteer to do my sidework for three weeks in exchange for the coveted information . Sorry , David . Besides , the place I work now is a class act super fancy place that uses paper napkins so I very rarely use the rollup technique anymore . Had you asked me how to wrap to-go item in foil into the shape of swans , geese , elephants , puppies , goldfish , Mariah Carey , antelopes or cantaloupes , I would happily direct you . But you did n't  so I wont . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . <p> youtube LONG ... <p> And David , I do apologize that I am unable to pass on the information that you need . The monks name was MahaTheraSayagi U Ba " Scooter " Khin and I know he would be very disappointed in me if I shared his knowledge . I am sure you understand , right David ? If the above video does not help you , I would suggest you take a quick trip over to Asia . There is a La Quinta in the foothills of the Himalayas that has a pretty good rate with a free Continental breakfast . The front desk can direct you to which cave Scooter lives in . Hed love to help you . Tell him I said hello . By the way , if you go , do n't  forget that Scooter is on a vow of silence so do n't  expect a lot of chit chat .
