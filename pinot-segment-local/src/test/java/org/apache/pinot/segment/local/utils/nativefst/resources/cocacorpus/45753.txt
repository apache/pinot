@@71811468 @511468/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> PWM Voltage Control Of Standard Linear IC Regulators <p> With many power supplies now being microprocessor based it is desirable to have simple way to control the voltage output of the supply from the ++P . An easy way to do that is with a PWM signal that most ++Ps can readily generate . This signal can be averaged to give a DC output voltage to control the regulator . The accuracy of PWM is not high , but most digital based supplies have digital readouts , allowing good accuracy setting of the voltage . If high control accuracy is desired , the regulator output voltage can be sampled by an A/D converter in the ++P , and the PWM duty-cycle adjusted accordingly . <p> Many standard IC regulators can be controlled in this manner , whose output voltage is normally determined by a resistor or two . These regulators are simple and rugged , generally having overcurrent and over-temperature protection . They also provide good regulation , maintaining the set voltage over a wide range of input voltage , temperature , and output current changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PWM signal controlling an LT3080 regulator , configured for a 15V maximum output . An LTC6992 is used to generate the PWM. simulating the ++P 's output . The LT3080 output goes from 0V to about 14V as the PWM signal goes from 0% to 100% duty-cycle , with a 15V supply . The LT3080 is a low-dropout regulator that can be adjusted down to 0V out , which is not common . Most IC regulators can only go down to about 1.25V minimum . <p> U3 is a 3-pole Bessel filter , which has the desired response of minimal overshoot with a step voltage change , using a common LM324/LM358 op amp . It has a 12Hz corner and a 60ms settling time to better than 1% , which averages and smooths the PWM pulses , giving a 0 to 5Vdc output for a 5V , 0-100% duty-cycle PWM input . One of the reasons for using this 3-pole filter design is that it has a passive RC first stage to roll off the high frequency edges of the square-wave . Otherwise those edges can feed directly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't fast enough to roll off those high frequencies through that feedback path . This edge spike feedthrough was seen during simulations of a 2-pole Sallen-Key filter . <p> The filter output is amplified by the non-inverting amp U4 with a gain of 3 to give the ( nearly ) 15V output . <p> The filter rolloff frequency and the amp gain are determined by the PWM frequency and the input to output voltage gain required . ( The simulation used a 550Hz PWM frequency , in the ballpark of Arduino PWM outputs ) . <p> It might be noted that the PWM duty-cycle to voltage accuracy is affected by the PWM pulse voltage , since that voltage is being averaged to get the output voltage . Thus for good regulator output voltage accuracy , the supply voltage for the ++P generating the PWM signal needs to be well regulated . <p> If the LT3080 is too expensive for your application , this circuit also works with common three terminal regulators , such as the ubiquitous LM317 , the tradeoff being that the minimum output is 1.25V instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

LCD or LED ? .. <p> If you want to use LED seven segment displays , then more questions ... Multiplexed or non multiplexed ? ... Quantity of multiplexed displays ? .. <p> LCD display units are relatively easy to hook up to a micro .. Many tutorials on this on the web ... So .... Here we are plumping for the old 7-seg types ... <p> If we use the small 7-seg you can easily just hook it up to a micro port with current limiting resistors .... Most LED 's are very visible around 810mA so if you base the design on 10mA you will need no current drivers ... Using a 40 pin Pic , you can drive two/three LED modules directly .. <p> Circuit 1 If you need to use a smaller pic , then you can consider multiplexing ... Be warned that multiplexing is time sharing ... Each module will get a percentage of display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you are multiplexing 8 modules the time to power the LED will make the LED appear a lot dimmer ... You can in these cases " up the current " but the limiting factor will be the capability of the micro pin .. Just because a micro pin can sink 25mA , does n't mean it will like doing so for ages ... Also a micro port will only allow a maximum of 100mA per port ... This means 14mA will be the maximum current allowed .. Again , I would n't recommend running near to maximum current .. <p> The alternative is by using shift registers with a latched output I have used 74hc595 with good success ... Each register can source / sink 25mA per pin ... BUT ! ! Alass the whole device is limited to 70mA ... We are back to 10mA which , in fairness , is enough ! I put transistor drivers on my LED 's , this way I can have the brightness I want .. <p> Anyway , we 'll do the multiplexed version afterwards .. <p> Writing the code to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really need is a " lookup " table to light the correct LED ' s to make sense .. <p> If you want to display the number 1 it looks like this .. <p> Note that to display a 1 then two segments need to be lit .. B and C .. Assuming this display is connected via current limiting resistors to port C of out Pic the output would be binary 00000110 or 6 decimal .. <p> *Note* when using Common Anode displays just flip the bits with COMF in asm or digit = digit ; in C .. <p> Moving on .. To place the digit to display just use the decimal representation of the number .. <p> Code ( c ) : <p> PORTC = DIGITnumber ; <p> Code ( asm ) : <p> movf number , wcall DIGIT movwf PORTC <p> Now each number 0 through 9 has a corresponding LED bitmap and the correct digit will be displayed .. <p> The counter portion is dead easy if you use timer 0 .. You can set the port pin 4 on port a to increment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any conditioning on the input as each counter input will have differing criteria and that is the fun of design , I 'll leave that up to the individual ! <p> Now ... Timer 0 is on permanently so you do n't have to start it ...

If you need more power , you can switch to darlington pairs , or Mosfets . <p> Could you explain specifically what you mean .

The circuit you posted looks nice and I am curious about the need for the IR4428 . My initial thoughts were to try something like was posted by EG at post #3 . I wo n't have much time to review this until later this evening . <p> I am not surprised . The IR4428 is way overkill for this application . But ask yourself in what way is it overkill . The IR4428 costs next to nothing , is freely available and is in a nice 8 pin pack . Why not ? <p> Referring to post #3 , moving 545 mA through a part rated for 600 mA is not god for long term reliability . The rule of thumb is that all parts run at no more than 50% of their ratings . 12 V circuit &gt; 25 V capacitors min. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collector current &gt; 1 A to 2 A transistor min. etc . <p> Also , 30-60 s is a loooong time for a single R-C timer stage . I recommend a single chip oscillator-divider ( CD4060 ) as a way to get long periods without huge capacitors . For 30 s on / 30 s off . a 555 would run at 1 Hz . A 4060 would run at 16,384 Hz . Schematic to follow . <p> Here is a Robust version for your review . On the secondary solenoid , I used two complimentary mosfets to lower the voltage drop on Q3 . Both Nmos transistors have an approximate 0.3v Vds and can handle many amps as your heart desires . 1 amp TO-220 package without a heatsink is more than sufficient . Also keep in mind Vout on pin3 of 555 is 2/3Vcc ( = approx 8v ) . The R4 and R5 are selected to provide approximately the same ( 8.1v ) at the gate of Q3 . Regard EG <p> Evil , you have your pmos upside down . And , why not replace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third fet . <p> Using the nmos I posted above a 50% voltage divider from the 555 would drive the first gate . The second gate could be driven by another divider from the junction of the first nmos and relay . <p> No circuit as no drawing package available at the moment . <p> edit , or choose a more suited nmos and get rid of dividers . <p> Mike . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> There are many ways to skin this cat . Thank you for PMOS correction . You can also do this with two opto-couplers and then connect the outputs to two NMOS . One uses logic positive and the other uses logic negative .

Schematic to follow . <p> ak 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I agree with your assessment as I put up a beefier one . However remember 555 is also modulating ! I believe 2N4401 and 03 can take peak current of up to 1A . I would not push it that way but just saying . It is more of power dissipation that will kill it rather than just plain current . If Vbe is low enough ( 0.4v ) then at 600ma you would burn up 240mw ! If modulating , then you can push the envelope a bit if you need to . As I said , I am not arguing with your valid point and if I had an expensive solenoid like the picture , I would do it right and spend couple of extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circuit Spec put up . Mine was a 3 minute post without calcations . My beefier circuit is simulated . Regards EG <p> Thanks to everyone for the well thought out suggestions . I am real busy at the moment and probably wo n't be able to do much with this project for a week or two . While looking at things a couple of more ideas came to mind . I would like to add a couple of led 's to indicate which solenoid is powered on . I assume I could add led 's with current limiting resistors in parallel with the load and the protection diodes across the solenoids ? It would be nice to be able to adjust frequency from 5 seconds to 1 minute . Does that just require a change in resistors or capacitors ? Both circuits are very robust .

Now to answer your question of being able to change the speed , change the resistors and capacitor of 555 circuit with the following values : C=1uF , R2=1k , and replace R1 with two resistors in series .

The requirement is 30 seconds to 60 seconds on and off period . Being lazy , and using a ball-park calculation , 100K and 1UF give a time constant of 100 milliseconds . Post #4 shows a time constant of 47uF and 2M = 95 seconds when the frequency potentiometer is at its maximum resistance and 47uF and 22K = 1 second when the potentiometer is at its minimum resistance , so the timing provided includes the OPs requirements and more . <p> By the way , the 47uF timing capacitor is a tantalum type for lower leakage current compared to an aluminum type . The Rolls Royce approach would be to use a polypropylene ( PP ) timing capacitor , but a 47UF PP capacitor would be big and expensive . The value of the timing capacitor could be reduced by an order by increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be advisable as any humidity may affect the timing . <p> AK 's suggestion of using a digital period generator would provide a Rolls Royce plus performance but with more cost and complexity . <p> Notice that I have specified an LMC555 rather than an LM555 . An LMC555 has a much higher input impedance on its TRIGGER and THRESHOLD pins and its ouput swings rail to rail . The C MOS version of the 555 has other benefits too . <p> I looked at a few circuits to implement this function and , so far , the simplest , but not best performing , would be to use an LM339 quad comparator for period generation and driving two NMOSFETs which , in turn , powered the solenoids . <p> But , as you imply , there are more ways than one of killing a cat than by poking its eyes out with a sharp stick . <p> I suspect your timing is still too short .

I am not sure why i was thinking k.k.uF will cancel each other out . It is K.uF with 1/1000 . Last OP 's post was 5-60 seconds . So I am off by a factor of 1000 on the resistor . T= ( R1+2R2 ) C/1.44 , For equal charge discharge T=RC/0.72 As forest gump would say . That 's all I have to say about that ...

Not all applications are about velocity or distance . The derivative is a more general concept that can be applied to many applications not just one particular one . <p> If the area is A=x2 , then with x=3 we get A=9 . But the change in area as x is varied in general is 2*x . Now going back to the area A=x2 , if x=3 then area A=9 , but the CHANGE in area when x is varied at the point x=3 by an increment dx is 6*dx because the area changes 6 times faster than x in that particular location . If x=5 then A=25 , and the rate of change of area with x at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amount the area changes 10 times faster than the increment dx . Note the area is not 2*x , that 's the derivative which is entirely different than the actual area . The line y=2*x ( which is the derivative function ) is also called the tangent line because it is the straight line that passes through the point x.y on the original graph of x2 . <p> Going back to x=3 , we get A=9 and the area changes at the rate of 2*x at that point , so if we change x by 0.1 unit we get 2*3*dx=6*0.1=0.6 square units , so let 's see how close this is : At x=3.1 we get area A=9.61 , so we got close with the estimate , 9.6 vs 9.61 which is exact . The reason it is not exact here is because the increment is still finite . As we make the increment dx smaller , we get a better an better approximation , until when we get to dx=0 we get the exact value but we must do it analytically we can not do it numerically without some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out what happens to the area , how it changes , as x changes by a small amount dx . It 's not about actually calculating the area in all cases , it 's about knowing how that area changes . For example , if you are going 100mph in a 60mph zone you know your distance is changing too fast for that location . <p> The simplest examples usually come from distance and velocity and then acceleration problems . Learning about them and how the derivative fits in is the usually way to learn about derivatives and why they are so important . <p> The applications that use the above concepts are extremely varied and very important in many areas of mathematics and science . Without the derivative there would probably be a lot of things that could not be solved in the universe today . <p> Last edited : May 22 , 2016 77974 @qwx697974 <p> I mean in theory , you are totally right , neptune ; no matter how small dx/x is , there is always ( dx/x ) 2 which is not present in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on real projects , you will discover by yourself when a small ( relatively speaking ) amount could be ignored or not . <p> For instance , when I solve equations now to find the values of resistances on the controller 's boards I design , I should remember that the tolerance of the resistors , I can get , are , at best , +/-5% <p> In brief , it is up to you , in real life , to choose the optimum accuracy that fulfil your goal . <p> Going back to x=3 , we get A=9 and the area changes at the rate of 2*x at that point , so if we change x by 0.1 unit we get 2*3*dx=6*0.1=0.6 square units , so let 's see how close this is : At x=3.1 we get area A=9.61 , so we got close with the estimate , 9.6 vs 9.61 which is exact .

What does lim-&gt;0 mean . What variable is approaching zero ? With respect to what variable are you calculating the function ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Correction as lim of x -&gt;0 , it means we never approach 0 , as lim 0/0 is indeterminate , we are just approximating curved graphs by a straight line at every point on the curve . perhaps we should never call that straight line tangent to a point because we never reach that point . <p> I was also thinking that i am confusing rates and amounts , if A= @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derivative shows instantaneous change(rate) , which is just a slope of tangent from that point or just an approximation of slope of tangent from that point , it was easy to understand in terms of position and time that slope of tangent is instantaneous velocity ( position/time ) . but here the slope of tangent is ( area/side ) i do n't know what to call it ? 77971 @qwx697971 <p> but why to calculate derivative in first place when i can tell the the exact change brought to area when i change x by 0.1 for example at x=3 ; A=3*3=9 but A=3.1*3.1=9.61 ; just subtract and you get change as 0.61 ; clearly we can deduce from it that when we x is changed by 0.1 at x=3 the A changes by 0.61 square unit 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Hi , <p> Because calculating the analytical derivative is exact while calculating the numerical derivative is not exact , and attempts to make it exact while still doing it numerically leads to a whole slew of problems . The problems in calculating numerical derivatives have been addressed in various ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multi point approximation when we need higher than just the two point approximation like you did there . One of the problems is that we have limited numerical precision in all numerical calculations especially when we rely on the usual PC computer precision of 16 or 17 digits . Even that many digits leads to problems . Let 's try to get a better approximation to see how this works . <p> 3.1*3.1-3*3=0.61 as you noted , and 0.61/0.1=6.1 but that 's off by more than 1 percent so let 's go with a smaller incrment : 3.01*3.01-3*3=0.0601 , and 0.0601/0.01=6.01 , closer but exact is 6 with no fractional part . 3.001*3.001-3*3=0.006001 , and 0.006001/0.001=6.001 , closer but still not exact . **28;0;TOOLONG , and that divided by 0.0001 is 6.0001 still not exact . continuing in this manner we come to : **31;30;TOOLONG , and what happened ? We started to loose precision when the increment got small . It 's not too bad because we happen to loose digits and in this case helps , but then we get to : **42;63;TOOLONG , and here we loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the digits ! So when we tried to get very high precision , we got zero as the derivative when we should have gotten exactly 6 eventually . But we also do n't  know that ahead of time like we do with this very simple example , so we might be inclined to keep trying to get better and better precision , and end up with zero <p> This example was not typical either , it was a very well behaved example . More common real life examples really start to get botched up sometimes after an increment as large as 0.001 , and in fact many programs do not go below 0.001 unless they use an adaptive step size algorithm . <p> So you see we are very lucky to be able to derive the analytical form of the derivative with a set of fairly simple rules . <p> Also , some problems need to be solved analytically so that they can be more general than a single numerical solution could be , and that 's when we really need the analytical derivative the most . Many theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many problems can be solved much easier and faster if we know how to deal with derivatives . Without them we would have to do the problem numerically over and over again . Consider the physical situation where there is a ladder leaning up against a wall , and it begins to slip down the wall . If the initial height of the ladder is given and the rate it slides down the wall is given , what is the rate that the bottom of the ladder slides across the ground ? That 's just one question that we might like to answer using derivatives . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> analytical derivative is exact while calculating the numerical derivative is not exact 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Why do you call analytical as exact when it ignores part in and gives dA =0.6 as opposed to 0.61 given by numeric method . <p> question is still unanswered , that why do we need to create a formula to find the slope of tangent. is it because derivative of a function gives us equation of the slope of function all along it more readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point using numeric method and then finding the equation of from it . 77971 @qwx697971 <p> but you gave me a new topic to see ( analytical and numerical derivative ) , which i never knew earlier , seems to me what i was analyzing was correct . <p> Why do you call analytical as exact when it ignores part in and gives dA =0.6 as opposed to 0.61 given by numeric method . <p> question is still unanswered , that why do we need to create a formula to find the slope of tangent. is it because derivative of a function gives us equation of the slope of function all along it more readily . Instead of slow process of finding slope at every point using numeric method and then finding the equation of from it . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Hi , <p> The number you get when you raise that number to the power of 2 will vary depending on what calculator or number cruncher algorithm you use . If you use the normal CPU floating point unit precision , i believe you get the number i quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPU to get more digits of precision then you will get another number , but if you make the increment smaller you should see the same thing happening again . The problem with using anything other than the floating point unit of the CPU along is that the calculations take a lot longer . Using the CPU power itself is the fastest calculation possible . <p> Analytical is called exact because when we allow the increment to becomes infinitesimally small , we get the exact slope at the point x , and we can ONLY get the increment to be infinitesimally small when we do it analytically , because in numeral sense an infinitesimally small number is zero , not really an infinitesimally small number . There are two things to look at : 1 . The precision of the calculation gets better and better with smaller and smaller inrement. 2. #1 above breaks down when we try to exceed the numerical precision of the number algorithm we are using . <p> #1 happens for a good reason . When we make the increment smaller , the second sample is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 3 " . #2 kicks in at some point because we loose decimal digits eventually , and so the subtraction y2-y1 actually becomes zero rather than just tending toward zero . <p> The analytical result tells us the actual derivative right at the target x value , which was 3 in our examples , while any attempt to get this with numerical calculations eventually breaks down unless the order of the method is equal to the order of the expression . For example , a first order method to calculate the derivative of x2 might fail at some point , but a second order method might provide an exact value . That same method will not work as well on x3 however because that would require a higher order method . <p> Analytical derivatives are not that hard to calculate so you should try to learn methods to do that . As you probably know , the rule for exponents is for example when y=xn : dy/dx=n*x(n-1) <p> Not too hard to do right ? There are rules for more complicated expressions too . <p> Numerical methods are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits of application . <p> The one sided derivative is : ( f(x+h)-f(x) ) /h <p> The two sided or central means derivative is : ( f(x+h)-f(x-h) ) / ( h+h ) 77974 @qwx697974 <p> it is also approximation as we can never put h=0 , as notion of change would go haywire . better we call it infinitesimal averaging of the slope of the curve . 77971 @qwx697971 <p> it is also approximation as we can never put h=0 , as notion of change would go haywire . better we call it infinitesimal averaging of the slope of the curve . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Well , we do n't  really have to invent anything new here to understand ( f(x+h)-f(x) ) /h . That 's an approximation , but in the limit it 's the exact derivative : limit h--&gt;0 ( f(x+h)-f(x) ) /h = dy/dx where y=f(x) . So in the limit the one sided derivative becomes exact . <p> If you look up how limits work you can take that limit and see what happens . For example , for x2 we have : y=x2 limit h--&gt;0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /h=2*x+h limit h--&gt;0 ( 2*x+h ) =2*x and we are left with the exact derivative . <p> Notice that we could not put h equal to zero in the original NUMERICAL expression , but we could in the limit after using the actual function . <p> For x3 we get a similar situation , 3*x2+3*h*x+h2 , and taking the limit as h goes toward zero we get 3*x2 which is again exact . Sometimes the limit is harder to find , but that 's the way it works . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> I guess if someone does n't like the notion of the derivative at a point of a function , he likely can not like the notion of the derivative of the whole function as well . But perhaps I am wrong . <p> For instance , what about the dx ( also close to zero but not zero ) in finding the integral of a function ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Hi , <p> Yes that 's not a bad point . Might as well ask why we use ' x ' in y=2*x+1 instead of just using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead as it makes it much easier Mathematical theory is more general than a simple numerical expression so it is more widely applicable . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> The formal definition of a derivative , as you 've pointed out , is However , the subtle point here is what the limit sign actually means .

If we had a less nice function , like a Heaviside step function H(x) = 0 if x&lt;0 , 1 if x&gt;0 , 1/2 at x=0 and tried to take the limit as x-&gt; 0 , we run into a problem . Approaching x=0 from the left ( negative ) side , H(x) tends to 0 , but approaching from the right says that H(x) tends to 1 . No matter what +&gt;0 we choose , f(0-+) = 0 , but f(0++) = 1 . We require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the limiting value , but no convergence is seen . <p> In plainer terms , the limit as x-&gt; 0 of H(x) does not exist . <p> What does this have to do with derivatives ? <p> Your question seems to stem from being worried about the value of the derivative at point a f ' ( a ) being the gradient ' just to the right of ' x=a , but because the derivative is a limit , not a value , it is in fact the value at the point . When you differentiate , you shrink h down to be close to zero from both sides : i.e. we require that <p> is satisfied .

The limit is the value an expression approaches as a variable within the expression approaches a particular value . <p> Yes minor typo it should be ( f(x+h)-f(x) ) /h , however that is not my reason for the reply . <p> It 's a little interesting that if we instead use an alternate definition : d f(x)/dx=limit ( f(x+h)-f(x-h) ) / ( h+h ) as h goes toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem because we must have plus and minus h to begin with which implies there are already values at those two points .

Those worlds are starting to collide , and I could n't be more excited . <p> It 's starting small . From Nintendo 's Amiibo , Toys for Bob &amp; Vicarious Visions ' Skylanders and LEGO 's Dimensions series , physical action figures usually relegated to being smushed together by over-eager hands are now tech savvy .

None of the documentation I 've read on calculating the frequency ever seems to talk about the voltage , however , from experimentation , I can clearly see a big change in the output frequency from below 20KHz to up around 30KHz as the voltage increases . The basic configuration of the circuit used r1=680R r2=62K c=330 pF <p> I have read that both R1 and R2 should be &gt; 1K , so maybe my r1 ( 680R ) might be what is causing this odd behaviour . <p> It 's not that odd , all 555 's do it that I know of , part of being analog . I think it 's because the internal transistors shift their bias points slightly as the voltage changes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77966 @qwx697966 <p> resistors has to be of the same value , they form a voltage divider to serve as preset for internal upper and lower comparator. 1/3 and 2/3 VCC voltage will be fed to the comparators. their output will set and reset the flip floop which inversly gives the ouput . <p> If R1 is the resistor tied to Vcc , then make it about 20K , then set your desired freq with the other resistor . Yeah , I know that will affect the duty cycle , but it will improve the freq stability over voltage . <p> btw-78L05s are really cheap . <p> btw- try a CMOS version . It will have less voltage variation . <p> Last edited : May 24 , 2009 77970 @qwx697970 <p> Having built and tested many 555 circuits in the astable mode I think that MikeBrady needs to check his equipment . I built the circuit as described(today) , using standard 555 's and some cmos versions . The basic frequency as measured on a frequency counter was very close to 33khz . The frequency did vary from 5V to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 350hz between the two voltages . This relates to little over 1% error . I think this is will within the spec 's of the 555 . <p> The great thing about electronics is unlimited ways to do the job . The only limit is one 's imagination . I generally think my way is best . Show me a different way . I have an open mind . <p> Thanks for the feedback . I tend to agree with k7elp60 , that the results I am getting are caused by the components/equipment . I 'm pretty confident that my oscilloscope is working correctly , so I 'll take another look at the components I 'm using . Anyway , it 's good to know that the frequency shifts I was seeing are NOT expected , which means I can continue to use the frequency calculators without having to factor in the voltage settings . <p> I have to agree that the frequency should not be changing unless something else is wrong such as way off resistor values or something just plain bad . <p> The 555 is set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vcc , and if you go over the equations for the frequency ( with the right circuit of course ) you get a frequency that does not vary with Vcc voltage because the trip points are always at 1/3 Vcc and 2/3 Vcc no matter what Vcc is , and that means that BOTH set points change as Vcc changes , which cancels any tendency to change frequency . I 'm sure in the real world this 1/3 and 2/3 is n't exactly exactly exact , but it 's close enough such that there should not be too much change anyway . Certainly not as much as 50 percent which is what seems to be happening here . <p> Perhaps you could post a schematic too so we can see exactly how you have this thing hooked up . I say this because there are ways in which you can connect the 555 that force the frequency to change with Vcc and so it could be a matter of how it is connected up . <p> Just to note , there is a neat little circuit that you can make with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about ... made with three resistors and one capacitor and one comparator section ( like that of an LM339 ) . This circuit too works by switching at 1/3 and 2/3 Vcc and it too has very stable frequency output . <p> Last edited : May 24 , 2009 77974 @qwx697974 <p> MrAL has confirmed what I ' thought ' I already knew ... the voltage should n't really be affecting the frequency at all . I 've been doing a bit more experimenting and can believe I can rule out the oscilloscope as the source of error - I tested the scope with a signal generator tool for a similar frequency , and it gave a very accurate result . So , I am now looking at either a ) my circuit being wrong b ) the components I have not being accurate enough <p> I 'd like to post a diagram of the circuit - apart from doing it in Visio ( which I already have installed ) is there a good ( free ) tool that anyone can suggest I use to create the diagram ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily enough ' cos its a digital scope I am using . <p> BTW , re . suggestion by MikeMi <p> btw-78L05s are really cheap . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I already have a steady voltage ... I have a very nice variable voltage power supply I built which is as steady as a rock - I was intentionally varying the voltage and observing the output from my oscilloscope - that 's what prompted the start of this thread . <p> The best part of the forum is this : It confirms things . We were all told 555 's have a reliable output frequency over a fair range of supply voltage , but when doubt cropped up via one of the posters , we thought : " maybe the 555 is n't that stable . " Now we know - it is . <p> Depends on the whole circuit , are there diodes ? There was another thread here where someone was getting frequency drift with a different type of circuit because the diode forward voltage changes with increase in VCC. 77966 @qwx697966 <p> Depends on the whole circuit , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting frequency drift with a different type of circuit because the diode forward voltage changes with increase in VCC. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> It 's more the ratio of the diode voltage drop : VCC that causes the shift ; the diode forward voltage only changes a small amount relative to the change in VCC . <p> I 've rebuilt the frequency generator circuit and it 's working pretty much to spec , although I am using different value for R1 , R2 and C this time . I did try to reproduce the behaviour I was seeing earlier , but could n't . As others have commented , the frequency is pretty stable across the range of voltages , so I am going to put my earlier experience down to poor circuit build - I am using a breadboard so maybe one of the connections was n't quite tight enough , or it could have been a dud cap , or ..... <p> I 'll install Pspice so I can draw up the circuit next time , but for anyone who is curious , it is the standard 555 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building a freq gen is that I want to drive an IR diode in such a way that it 's signal can be picked up by a ' tuned ' IR receiver . The component I am using for the receiver is the RPM7100 series from LONG ... and what I was hoping to be able to do is to detect the presence/absence of the IR beam using this receiver . When an IR beam with matching frequency is detected , the output of this receiver should go low , otherwise it should be high ( around 5 volts ) . <p> However , I have hit a couple of challenges ... <p> 1 ) reading the datasheet for the receiver , its not clear to me what frequency it will detect at - the datasheet describes 4 different frequencies . The only identifying marks are on the back of the receiver - 1B34 04A . <p> 2 ) I am using a BC549 NPN transistor with the o/p from the 555 wired to base , and an IR LED with ( current limiting ) series resistor connected between +5v @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should cause the IR diode to switch on/off at the same frequency as the o/p from the 555 . However , I am seeing a drop in the frequency when measured at the LED , for example , if I measure the o/p of the 555 I get 36KHz , but when I connect the o/p to the transistor base , and then measure at the collector , I get readings around 28 - 30 KHz , and it is quite unstable . <p> Question : I 'm sure there 's an easy explanation for why the frequency will vary in this way . Do I need to compensate by increasing the 555 frequency , so that it will be say , 36KHz , when measured at the LED ? What about the way the frequency shifts - is there something else I need in my circuit to enable a constant frequency output from the LED ? 
@@71811520 @511520/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Both Sexes for the Price of One : PMCPB5530 complementary MOSFETs <p> As supply line voltages have dropped , typically from 5V to 3.3V and even 1.8V for many microcontrollers , it has become increasing difficult to drive MOSFETS . This article highlights a chip that contains both N and P type very low gate drive ( VLGD ) MOSFETS which overcome this problem . Not only is the chip compact , but it is jelly bean priced and freely available . I have found that it is a handy chip for quite a few designs so far , and I thought other ETOnions might also find it useful or maybe just of interest . It seems to be the kind of chip that you might want to keep in your spares box . <p> The miniature case is a problem for experimental use . Two solutions are to glue the case , pads up , onto a PCB and solder thin wires to the pads . This approach would only be suitable for low power applications though , because there would be no heat conduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted on a header to convert to through hole . <p> ( 2 ) BACKGROUND <p> JFETS were ground shakers when they came out in the early 1970s : they were also a great comfort to us valve ( tube ) boys because , essentially , they worked just the same and , better still , at a price you could get female versions ( P types ) too . <p> Then in the early 1980s there was an earthquake when International Rectifier ( IR ) introduced the first NMOSFETs . They were also similar to valves but differed in that they were enhancement mode rather than depletion mode like valves and JFETS . But the shattering thing was that they could handle the same current as high power BJTs and , quite soon , they were able to handle currents of 50A and then 100A . This meant that with a mere 20V and no current on the gate you could control massive amounts of power . <p> But MOSFETs had their drawbacks : high non linearity , parasitic reverse diode , but worst of all , huge parasitic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate to drain being the most problematic . The other killer with the parasitic capacitances is that they are not fixed but are modulated by gate drain and gate source voltage . The non-linearity and the modulated parasitic capacitances made MOSFETs difficult to use as audiophile output power stages . <p> With time , new circuit techniques were developed to get around these characteristics but , in the main , MOSFETS became preeminent switches in switch mode power supplies ( SMPSs ) and also as solid state switches for turning power lines on and off . Now , there is a vast selection of NMOSFETS and PMOSFETS to suit a wide range of applications . <p> Another major problem with MOSFETs is the relatively high gate voltage they need to get any drain current flowing , so the recent initiative has been to produce MOSFETS with very low gate drive voltages ( VLGDs ) . In fact , Advanced Linear Devices ( ALD ) have the ALD110800 range of MOSFETs with zero gate drive voltages . But , most sensitive MOSFETs are low gate drive ( LGD ) types which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain current ( I 'd ) with 2.5V gate voltages . <p> ( 3 ) VLGD NMOSFET &amp; PMOSFET IN ONE CASE <p> NXP ( ex Phillips ) seem to specialise in medium and low power LGD and VLGD MOSFETs at reasonable prices . For general applicability , the PCMPB5530X , which has complementary MOSFETs in one case , seems to be the pick of the bunch . Even if you only want an N type or P type MOSFET , this chip is so cheap that it is no extra expense to simply not use the other MOSFET ( connect the gate and drain on the unused MOSFET together ) .

You design the circuit so that it will work with the full range of hFE from 100-300 .

That is generally an engineering judgement . <p> For example , suppose the circuit gain must be within a value of 50-10% .

So if you 're connecting a 480V/240V transformer across 2 phases of 480 , why does it matter if it 's WYE or DELTA or corner gounded delta or anything ? AFAIK if the transformer sees 480 it puts out 240 regardless of phase configuration or voltage to ground . <p> Right , you ca n't use ground to carry current .

@@71811533 @511533/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> I 've automated the very crude charger in my brother 's 35-yr-old electric car , with relays that switch the 120 VAC input from one transformer tap to another , and ultimately pull power from the transformer entirely when the batteries are fully charged . Not surprisingly , this can produce substantial transients that I 'm concerned may eventually damage the transformer . ( The relays have already had to be replaced , despite being rated for higher currents than they 're actually carrying . ) I 'm looking for advice on the best way to suppress these transients . I had a SiBOD device that I found on eBay between each transformer input tap and the 120 VAC power source , which seemed to help ( i.e. the car became less likely to trip the household circuit breaker when switching rates or shutting off ) . But then one of them shorted out such that it provided a path for power to continue flowing to the transformer after the relays had pulled power to shut it off . And since replacing that damaged one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it tried to shut off , so this solution is clearly imperfect . I 'm vaguely familiar with the concept of RC snubbers , but would n't know how to properly spec one even if I did have complete specs on this transformer ( which I do n't ) . <p> How about using Using Opto Coupled Triacs with Zero Crossing Switchover in place of the Relays ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> If I were to do it all over again , I 'd probably try design a solution like that , or something similar ( to provide zero-crossing switchover ) . But for the near term I was hoping that someone might be able to suggest something relatively straightforward that I could add to the existing circuits to suppress the transients sufficiently that my brother can plug the car in and walk away without worrying about tripping the household breaker when the charger changes rates or shuts itself off . <p> As far as I know , there are two reasons why a domestic supply will trip : ( 1 ) Excess current ( 2 ) Inbalace between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your supply has a ground current trip . <p> It would be important to determin the cause for tripping before a solution can be suggested . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> The breaker in question will not trip on ground current . I do n't know definitively whether it 's tripping on excess current or on a live/neutral imbalance . But I do know that the breaker trips correspond to the switching performed by the relays , and that their occurrence was reduced by the addition of the SiBOD devices ( not shown ) between the transformer inputs and the mains power . <p> a . The rate-change relay is n't open before close and is thus shorting part of the transformer winding . The shorted transformer turn causes a large current flow ( while the relay switches ) . <p> b . The rate-change relay flashes over ( sometimes ) so it 's opening before closing but the opening arc flashes to the other contact with the same results as ( a ) . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Barring flash-over phenomena , the design of the relay precludes ( a ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurring ( if you 're standing around with the hood open after dark , you can see an arc when it switches--at least you could before I added the SiBOD devices ) . However , that does n't explain the occasional breaker trips that occur when then shutoff relay pulls power--there 's seemingly something else about the resulting transient spike that trips the breaker . <p> How easy would it be to use two relays with a time delay between them ( and with some sort of interlock too so they both ca n't be on ) instead of the rate-change relay ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Not easy , from my point of view . ( I 'm a mechanical engineer by training , and the analog circuit I 've built to energize these relays in response to battery voltage is pretty much the limit of my self-taught electrical engineering abilities . ) Additionally , I suspect that the transient voltage spike that comes from pulling power from the transformer would still be a problem , even if I could implement your staggered switching solution . <p> If you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would seem that what I really ought to do is replace each of my relays with no fewer than four separate relays , to sequentially 1 ) Connect the mains power ( in parallel ) to the same input tap that it 's already powering , but via a resistor , 2 ) Disconnect the direct connection between mains power and the first input tap , 3 ) Connect the mains power to the other input tap via a resistor ( thus briefly shorting the transformer winding through the resistors ) , 4 ) Disconnect the connection made in step #1 , 5 ) Connect the mains power to the other input tap directly , and 6 ) Disconnect the connection made in step #3 . But I figure there ought to be a solid-state means of mitigating the transient voltage spike without resorting to that level of complexity . <p> You could try fitting a mains filter like the filters that are fitted to large washing machines . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I 'm intrigued .

Hmm ... 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Being a Brit , I 'm not familiar with GFI outlets so I ca n't be authoritative , but I cant see that there would be a problem . The filters do not trip the ground current detectors ( sensitive type ) fitted to some UK domestic installations . <p> This type of filter is ubiquitous , being fitted to most electronic and electrical equipment s , in one form or another .

I do n't know definitively whether it 's tripping on excess current or on a live/neutral imbalance . But I do know that the breaker trips correspond to the switching performed by the relays , and that their occurrence was reduced by the addition of the SiBOD devices ( not shown ) between the transformer inputs and the mains power . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Hello there , <p> When something does not work right we look for the mechanism that is causing the problem . Once we find the mechanism , we can solve the problem with almost no doubt . This means no guessing . <p> In this case there are only a couple reasons how this could trip a breaker . One is high primary current , and the other one is high secondary current which then causes high primary current . To find out which one , we would measure the current using a scope . That would tell us immediately which one is causing the problem . <p> Without that measurement however it looks like the only things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relay arc over causes a short between contacts and therefore makes it look as if there is a partial short on one winding . 2 . Either relay opening along with partial arc over causes a boost converter syndrome which causes a high output current on the secondary which of course causes high primary current . <p> Luckily the reason for either or both of these conditions is because the transformer primary is temporarily open circuited . To solve the problem then the solution is to stop the primary from becoming completely open circuited . <p> Since either relay has to open for at least a short time , that means we should apply a load to the PRIMARY either just before we switch the main relay or just keep it applied continuously if we can stand the efficiency loss . The size of the load will vary depending on primary current , but even an incandescent light bulb might do the trick . That should get you going at least for the time being . <p> Remember that if the primary is loaded correctly there will be no arc over . 77974 @qwx697974 
@@71811535 @511535/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> What voltage to use to charge a 7.2 V Battery ? <p> I 'm about making a batterycharger , charging a Ni-Cd Battery rated at 7.2V 1500mAh , but what should the charge voltage be ? 7.2 V ? at the orginal charger I measured around 11.8V when the charger was ON but the battery disconnected . <p> A very simple answer is enough voltage to yeild the desired amount of current to flow into the battery . The voltage applied will always have to be slighly above the battery voltage at any given moment in order for the battery to charge . The open circuit voltage of a simple charger may be very high relative to the desired battery voltage but because of it 's design only a limited current will flow . The resulting voltage settles where it settles based on internal resistance and other things . <p> There are limits to the rate at which you can charge a battery . Use of a charger based on voltage alone might ruin the battery or worse , create a dangerous situation . Some batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't . Sorry to be so unclear but it 's not a simple question . <p> If you are n't concerned about the time charging takes you might construct a simple current limited charger with a 10 or 12 vdc power supply capable of delivering 50 to 100 milliamps . See the datasheet for an LM317 - it shows a simple current regulator that you could set up for 50 or 75 ma . It might take 24 hrs to charge the battery but you stay way away from overheating and other problems . There are numerous ways to charge batteries at faster rates - some very complex but that preserve battery life - some simpler at the expense of time or some battery life . Many of these are described at websites- you might search prior posts under battery chargers . Some of these are really sophisticated but thanks to modest cost ICs are within the range of a person with modest electronics skills . <p> As a general rule , from what I 've seen - a simple , low-cost charger can be used if time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time becomes a bigger factor then more elaborate schemes are applied to increase the charge rates in a way that minimizes danger -possibly at some expense in battery life . My son used these batteries in so called fast chargers . They did work and the batteries got hot but did n't explode . I think that it was more " cut and try " rather than good design on the part of the charger manufacturer . I 'm also convinced that battery life was much less than it could have been but then like everything else in life you trade on thing for another . <p> You could " cut and try " using the scheme I described , increasing the current . That IC ( LM317 ) is good for an amp or more . I ca n't tell you how hot is too hot for the battery or at what point it might let go . An amp gets the charge time down to a few hours or less . I 've no way to determine if you apply 12 volts if the battery will charge at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geez ! your good stevez ! This battery is a part of a backup circuit where the battery charges , as long as the circuit gets power from a walloutlet , but once the power from the walloutlet is cut , the battery kicks in . <p> So the charging time does n't need to be fast , I think 15mA is enough , 1% . So 9V ( or more ? ) would be enough to charge the bat ? <p> If you plan to leave this on line constantly there might be some issues with a constant trickle charge - though with very low current the likelihood of a problem ought to be low . <p> It would be nice to put something in to turn the charger off , turn it on . The problem is that the difference between a fully charged battery and partially discharged one is n't great - and all of that changes with temperature and from battery to battery making it very difficult to know with any certainty what level of charge is contained in a battery . By the time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery . <p> Really good chargers account for temperature and watch the incremental changes in voltage over time to indicate where things are at . Good project for a PIC probably but too many things on my to-do list already . <p> Nicad batterys have very close to 1.5V per cell across their terminals at room temperature . If you construct a constant current charger of the Capacity of the cells times 0.095 the charger can be left on all the time with out damage to the cells , this is at normal room temperature about 74 degrees F. <p> In your case 1500Ma X .0.095 = 142.5Ma . But as others have suggested about 100Ma would be fine . As long as the charger will supply 9V at your charging current everything should be great . <p> The great thing about electronics is unlimited ways to do the job . The only limit is one 's imagination . I generally think my way is best . Show me a different way . I have an open mind . <p> Absolutely , but if the current is correct why measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding the voltage , I would recommend 2Volts / cell to be on the safe side . The higher the charge current the higher the voltage get over the cells . <p> NICAD 's should be charged with a constant current , an extremely simple way to do this is a high value resistor from a high voltage . Assuming a high enough voltage is n't available , you can use an electronic constant current source to do the same thing - I would suggest 12V or so for charging 7.2V from a constant current source .

Does that mean that each phase delivers 69.33 VAC ( I know that 's not right but I do n't understand ) ? <p> In a previous post " Diver300 " was helpful he stated that to find the KWh I could take the 3 * Amp * Vac = KWh . That came pretty close , but I guess my question is why the 3phases and why the wierd 208VAC ? <p> For a Wye connection this is basically what you have . Think of a 120/208 three phase system as the capital letter ' Y ' . From the center to any of the three end points you have 120 units of measure . From any point on the end to another end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another way to think of it as three triangles with two legs 120 units long and a base 208 units long . The one corner with the two 120 sides is the center of the ' Y ' . the other two corners with a 120 and a 208 represent two of the ends of the letter ' Y ' . If you place the three triangles together with all the 120 sides against each other you end up with three equilateral points 120 degrees apart in reference to a single rotation or circle . The more common high power connection in North America is the 277/480 . Its the same ratios just at a higher voltage . The more common European standard is the 240/416 I think . <p> Simple geometry using nothing more than triangles and a circle . <p> For a delta connection ( + " ) you just have one equilateral triangle with no center point . They are most often 240 volt or 480 volt . In some applications they add the center tap to one side of the triangle so it has one leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get the 120/208/240 or the 240/416/480 three phase connection system . The 208 or 416 volts come from that one center tapped side going strait across to the opposite corner . <p> On a three phase name plate the amps rating is the amps per each leg . So a 240 volt , 20 amp three phase circuit carries the same power as three single phase circuits of equal voltage or 240 volts at 60 amps single phase while only adding one more wire . 77965 @qwx697965 <p> I am lost when it comes to figuring out 3 phase ANYTHING ( just never really understood the concept or the need ) . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Here are three basic advantages I can think of for three phase power . <p> 1 ) It requires the least amount of copper to transmit a given amount of AC power .

( Even though the power of each phase fluctuates , the power sum from all three phases is continuous with no variation ) . <p> 3 ) If you rectify a 3++ signal to get DC power , the ripple is much lower than from a 1++ signal , thus requiring much less capacitance to minimize the ripple , and lower peak currents in the transformer . <p> At some point going to a three phase supply makes more sense simply because the load requirements and the related larger wiring makes it a more cost effective way to get that power to the device . <p> Plus its typical application may be that its manufacturers target market is commercial and industrial settings where three phase power is standard . <p> I have a number of older commercial three phase machines and devices I run on single phase but they needed wiring modifications in order to handle the higher amperages that are then drawn from them being on a single phase source . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sourced load over to a single phase source means it now draws 60 amps .

@@71811557 @511557/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> Well the datasheets for these kind of counters should explain modulus capablity , but basically you have the option with internal reset circuitry and access by device pins to have the counter " reset " at any count up to the 16 count capablity of a 4 bit counter . Example , Modulus 10 would have the counter with states 0-9 and then reset to zero , making it a decimal counter . <p> The word modulus ( Lat. nominative singular ) and the modulo ( Lat. ablative ) both refer to the base of a number system . The number of unique states that a counter may have before the sequence repeats itself is the modulus of the counter . We call it a modulo-n counter if it has n-states .

( From the markings on the transformer I can see it was made in Italy , but can not make out the name of the Company ) <p> Thank you <p> John 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Bonjour John , <p> Welcome to ETO . Which part of France are you from ? If you put it next to ' Location ' on your user page it will show in the box at the left of your posts . <p> If I read you correctly , you suspect that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> I have n't investigated a replacement transformer or analysed your circuit in detail , but I suspect that the circuit simply comprises a mains transformer , rectifier , reservoir capacitor , and three-terminal voltage regulator ( L7805 ) to provide a 5V supply line , just as you imply . The only complication that I can envisage is that the transformer secondary may feed another circuit , like a zero voltage detector , for example . <p> Those small low-power ( 2W ) mains transformers have very fine primary windings which are prone to go open circuit . The bad news is that it may be impossible to get an exact replacement transformer , but the good news in that , with a bit of ingenuity , you should be able to fit another model of transformer that will do the job well or even better . But I would advise getting a sealed transformer , like the original . <p> A replacement transformer would need to meet the following requirements ; ( 1 ) Primary : suitable for the mains in France ( 230V AC RMS at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you can not get this exact voltage , a slightly higher voltage will be fine . ( 3 ) Power rating : 2W . Any power rating of 2W or greater will be suitable ( but the transformer physical size will be the limit ) <p> There are many transformers on the market that will probably suit . I will investigate but if I ca n't find a suitable replacement transformer there are many ETO members who surely can . <p> I have had a quick look on the net and ca n't find a suitable transformer . <p> But another approach you can use , providing there is no take off from the transformer secondary for another circuit , is to replace the faulty transformer by an off line 9V switch-mode power supply . This is just a thought at the moment . <p> I live just outside Paris , and have updated my " personal details " as you suggested to show where I live . My home has 3 phase electricity ( as do many in France ) , and unfortunately during the floods in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead cables were installed ( and are still there ! ! now in November ) , but my cables were torn out by a dustbin lorry driver who did not see them ! The neutral cable was ruptured , and all my appliances in the house received 380 - 400 volts instead of 220 volts . The insurance claim has been a total nightmare , and in France you are expected to show the original purchase invoices of your appliances if you make a claim . Not only that , the insurance writes the value down by 1.72% per month . So after 5 years your appliances are considered to have no value ! ! ! Unfortunately the money I am likely to receive from the insurance will fall very far short of what it will cost to repair and replace . <p> I have a long list of things that do n't work , including the Whirlpool freezer , a Daewoo microwave , a Samsung TV , a Pioneer HIFI , a tower computer , and a whole load of other smaller appliances like Radio alarm clock , home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact all the equipment that has electronic circuit boards in them . Interestingly , all the PCB mounted transformers have blown in all of them on the primary coils . The secondary coils are ok , so I am hoping that everything downstream of the transformers will be OK . <p> The problem is I can not find the PCB mounted transformers anywhere . <p> I thought I would post my first message ( about Whirlpool freezer ) on this forum to see if I received any replies . I have done , for which I thank you . <p> The transformer for the Whirlpool freezer is one of the simplest , because it only has one output voltage . Do you think I can replace the burnt out 6.6v transformer with a 6v one , or would it be better to buy a 9v one ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> The Daewoo microwave and Pioneer HIFI both have transformers with multiple output voltages ( 3 different voltages ) , but I will make another posting on this forum to describe them , hoping that you may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have had . Luckily all the equipment you described may be fixable , but if the big transformer in the microwave has blown that would write the microwave off . <p> Can I ask what skills and equipment you have so that we can get an idea of what is feasible . <p> You ask about a 6V or 9V transformer . That is something I have been looking at too . If the circuit is in fact just a simple low power power supply , 9V may be suitable , provided the reservoir capacitor has a voltage rating of 13V or more . It would be possible to put a couple of cheap and small components in series with the transformer secondary to reduce the voltage by 2V or so . <p> 7.5V is another standard transformer voltage which would be ideal , but less common . <p> The board looks very simple . Is there any chance you could trace out the circuit from the secondary of the transformer , including the reservoir capacitor , rectifier , and the three terminal regulator . Look for any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me with a Westinghouse fridge , the board was going to cost $200 Australian . Going by the relay voltage on my board at 12V , went looking for a 13 to 15V transformer from scraped apliances . I found this blue transformer in a scraped microwave oven &amp; used that . Unless you was using the microwave oven at the time then the main HV transformer will be ok . Its more likely that the small LV transformer on the control board in the microwave is burnt out . <p> Here is another possible transformer . It is 6.0 volts rather than 6.6 volts so it may require replacing the 7805 with an LDO regulator . I think it is unlikely the pin layout will match so you would probably have to drill some extra holes in the PCB and add wire links to the pins . I found this on Farnell 's webside by searcing for " transformer PCB mounted .

My digital meter is broken ! ) There is no short across any of the primary and secondary terminals .......... have tested all combinations . If there should be a high resistance on the primary ............. the transformer may be OK . <p> Hi John , I suspect the blue component marked R32 is in fact a metal oxiide varistor. these are to protect the circuit from transients . I suspect this has failed almost short circuit causing the new 100 ohm resistor to fail . I think R32 is connected directly across the transformer primary . Can you photograph the etch side of the board and one of the new " 100 ohm resistors " ( So we can confirm that it is a 100 ohm resistor . ) It is nice to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about their problem . Too many posts start out something like " Tell me what to replace to fix my fridge " I will see if I can identify the varistor . ( I think I will be able to read the part number as your pictures are so good . <p> Hi John , I have found the datasheet on the device . It is a varistor . Farnell stock them . If it is connected in the way that I think it is then the board sould work with it removed but you should replace it to protect other parts . They are also sold on ebay. this is one advert . <p> Hi John , You have already measured the resisistance ( In post #15 ) of the varistor by measuring the resistance between the tracks that went to the transformer primary . You said that the reading was 300 ohms . As I can see nothing else in prrallel with the varistor this must be it 's resistance . You can remove it and test it out of the board and if it is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just tested the resistance reading of some similar varistors and they all read greater than 20 megohms . ) I think if you replace the transformer and 7805 you will find that you get the regulated 5 volts output . The board is just the 5 volt power supply and relay with a driver transistor . In post#12 you say that the compressor still runs . I suspect that the relay on this board controls the power to the compressor . As there is no 5 volts the relay could not be energised so I think the contacts may have welded together on the relay . ( Unless thy are normaly closed contacts which is umlikely . ) Can you measure the resistance between the square pad under the relay with 4 pins comming through it ( Directly below the word plug of power plug. ) and the track just to the right of it . Do not test the board out of the freezer unless you feel confident working on a board with open live mains on it . If you have a low wattage ( 15 - 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) connect it in series with the live side of the mains to the board .

@@71811578 @511578/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> Do you have a load between the cathode of the diode and the neg terminal of the battery ( other than the internal resistance of the voltmeter ) ? The meter resistance is high , probably &gt;20megOhm , so the current being drawn through the diode is likely less than 400nA .

@@71811582 @511582/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Home Built Transformer 120 volt primary 48 volt secondary with CT <p> I used a 900 watt microwave oven transformer to build this with a 48 volts secondary . I decided since I only need 36 turns of wire I would not take the welded laminations apart . I could have removed the welds in the milling machine but I think it will be more work than fishing the wire around and around through the 2 holes . <p> I tested the house voltage it is 122 VAC . <p> I tested the microwave oven transformer my Amp Clamp reads 10 Amp idle current with no load on the 2000 VAC secondary coil . This seems high ? <p> Idle current is high 122 x 10 = 1220 watts . <p> I cut the secondary winding off with the milling machine then drill through the holes with a .500 " drill . I pulled what was left of the secondary winding out with plyers . <p> There are 89 turns of wire on the microwave oven primary . It is an open winding with 9 layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last layer it as 9 turns . Core area on this transformer is 3.3984 sq inches . <p> I did the math several times just to double check to see how many turns should be on the primary but I kept making math errors . One time the math said the primary needs 2 turns . Another time in was over 8000 turns . I tried one more time got a goofy answer so I guit . <p> Next , with an 89 turn primary on 120 VAC the secondary winding of 48 VAC needs to be 35.6 turns with a center tap . That is 18 turns for 24 volts each side of the center tap . <p> I put 10 turns on the secondary then tested the transformer With 120 VAC on the primary I get 9 volts on the 10 turn secondary . A added 1 turn at a time and checked it again each time 13 turns gave me 12 volts . I figure I need 13 more turns to get 24 volts but 26 turns gives me 25 volts . Remove 1 turn it gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it dry over night . I had to make 3 terminals to glue to the fiberglass tape then wrapped it with more fiberglass tape . I soldered both center taps to the center terminal and the other 2 wires to the other 2 terminals varnished it and let it dry . <p> I tested each 24 volt winding each one reads 24 VAC . I tested both windings in series and it reads 50 VAC . How can that be ? ? ? I test it again with a different volt meter and I still get 24 VAC + 24 VAC = 50 VAC . How is that possible ? ? ? <p> Amp clamp still reads 10 amp idle current on the primary like before nothing has changed . <p> I removed the transformer shuts current is now up to 12 amps on the primary and the secondary voltage is up from 50 to 54 volts . <p> PLEASE be EXTREMELY careful when playing around with microwave oven transformers ! They can kill you instantly with a single touch . I know you have worked with Tesla coils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but I wanted to post this in case anyone else wants to try what you 're doing too . <p> To anyone considering using a microwave oven transformer for anything , 77967 @qwx697967 <p> Because a microwave oven transformer is relatively low duty cycle they typically run less turns per volt for a given core area on their windings then a continuous duty transformer . This make the unloaded inductance lower then a normal transformer and therefore more reactive idle current . <p> The 10 amps unloaded primary current is mostly inductive reactance so it is n't anywhere near 1220 watts . If it was the transformer would burn up is a matter of minutes . It probably has a real power dissipation of about 75 to 100 watts , which is still quite high for that sized transformer . If you run it in continuous duty use the core will get pretty hot and waste a lot of power . <p> Because the core is seam welded you can not take the laminates apart . Being that you did n't need that many turns for secondary it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to be careful not to knick the wire insulation on edge of core while pulling wire through . <p> Because a microwave oven transformer is relatively low duty cycle they typically run less turns per volt for a given core area on their windings then a continuous duty transformer. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> What are you talking about ?

Once a month ? 2 ) How long is a microwave oven used at full power ? 30 seconds . 2 minutes ? The transformer probably takes 10 minutes to fully heat up . <p> Ok , I finally got my math correct . With a core area of 3.398 sq . in. the transformer needs 205 turns on the primary . My guess inductive reactance is too low making it pull a high idle current on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers , 24 volts + 24 volts = 50 volts ? ? ? 13 turns = 12 volts but 26 turns = 25 volts ? ? ? <p> Magnetic field is directly related to the number of turns in a coil .

It is obvious with the numbers above the more turns on the secondary the higher the voltage is per turn . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> A continuous duty transformer would have about twice the transformer core area for that much power . A 900 watt microwave magnetron output power needs about a 1400 VA transformer . That would be about 7 sq inches for core area and about 0.7 turns per volt winding for continuous duty . ( but a microwave oven magnetron is also skimped on design so it is not rated for continuous operation either ) . <p> A continuous duty 60 Hz transformer with a 3.4 sq . inch core would be rated at about 400 VA with about 1.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminates much of transformer buzz but increases the eddy current losses by the core .

Very strange .... <p> Thanks for your patience guys . 77967 @qwx697967 <p> I have wound AC line transformers before and I need about 10 times the area that professionals use because my wire has thick insulation . The guy who started this thread seems to know what he is doing . The first strange post I saw was a warning about high voltage which of course was obsolete because the HV secondary was gone . I looked at the primary current waveform on a scope once and it is decidedly not a nice sine wave . That means the iron is getting into the saturation region which means hysteresis loss . That agrees with a number of the posts above . I do n't like the primary current being so high for fresh unmodified transformers because it pops my 3A breaker . So I plan to add more primary turns but put them on the secondary side of the magnetic shunt . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act like a constant current source , which does not draw too much current when shorted ( electrically ) . I will wind as many wires as will fit and then measure the open circuit voltage and short circuit current . With luck it might be a good 12V transforer . I measured the secondary voltage of a number of good Microwave transfoormers and they were all about 2KV . A rule of thumb : If you add 10% more turns to the primary you can cut the hysteresis heating significantly and have a much nicer transformer . <p> I talked to a friend that is a retired electrical engineer he worked for a company that maked transformers for about 30 years . He says the microwave oven transformer is designed to come on at full power and stay at full power all the time . It does not have an idle current like most transformers . The low number of primary turns pulls a very high current all the time therefore the transformer does not need a load to make it come up to full power . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like I need to start over . The primary winding needs to have 205 turns of #20 wire . The secondary needs to be 82 turns of #16 wire with a center tap . All I need is 320 watts max 24-0-24 vac . The 3.398 sq . in. core area can handle 1000 watts . <p> Please do n't sent me private messages about electrical topics .

Then I removed all the laminations from the transformer . Tomorrow I will make a turning fixture to wind the transformer in the lathe if I have time .

I will use enough laminations to have a core area of 3.5156 sq . in. so the transformer will have 200 turns on the primary and 80 turns on the secondary with CT . <p> I am retired and having fun building this transformer so I really does not matter that I have to build it to get what I need . <p> I talked to a friend that is a retired electrical engineer he worked for a company that maked transformers for about 30 years .

The transformer would be toast in about 25 minutes if it was dissipating 1220 watts with no load . Ask yourself where 1220 watt of power would go . 77967 @qwx697967 <p> What we normally see in the transformer primary is excitation current . This excitation current is out of phase with the line voltage and so does not cause too much power heating , except in the wire itself which has to carry the current . <p> On the other hand , what you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding that does n't  really have enough turns for the core area , so it is probably causing core saturation which would cause more current at the peaks . You can verify this with a scope and current probe . <p> To correct the problem , you would add more turns to the primary . With the core area at about 3.4 square inches you might get away with a 1 volt per turn ratio , meaning you would need at least 120 turns on the primary . This would probably get you going . In any case , adding turns to the primary will help quite a bit and make the transformer much more usable . <p> You can take it from there , adding a secondary and see what you can get out of it . With 120 turns on the primary you 'll get 24v output with 24 turns ( or a little more to make up for loading effects ) . <p> You probably want to consider loading effects too , calculating the primary and secondary resistance and calculating the voltage drop with a given load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600 circular mils per amp or better . <p> Last edited : Jan 10 , 2012 77974 @qwx697974

The generator lit the 25 W headlight and the 5 W tail light directly . That type of generator is limited by its inductance so the current is basically constant . When the headlight was turned off , a resistor was used to take current so that the sidelight bulb did n't burn out . <p> I changed the whole lot to 12 V. I fitted a 55/60W headlight bulb , with a 5 W panel bulb that in parallel with dip beam only . I moved the tail light to the DC circuit . As the current was much the same ( 60 W on 12 V is 5 A. 30 W on 6 V is also 5 A ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tick-over than the 6 V one did . <p> I added a regulator to hold the battery voltage at 14 V , and used the magneto coil on the alternator as an additional charging supply . I changed the magneto ignition to capacitor discharge , mainly to reduce electrical power consumption . I changed all 9 bulbs ( headlight , sidelight , brake/tail , 4 indicators , neutral warning and main beam warning ) to 12 V , and fitted a 12 V flasher from a car , that was far better than the stupid thermal / capacitor one from Honda . <p> I still do n't really understand how Honda managed to get away with such poor electrics , when the mechanical parts were fine , and the cars that they were selling then had electrics that worked fine . <p> If your headlight is 35 W , 12 V you ca n't do much about increasing the power .

If you want to increase the current , you would have to reduce the number of turns . <p> You could see if you could find a replacement bulb that is made with yellow LEDs. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I do n't  know whether LEDs headlights is available for my bike or not ... most probably not . <p> I 've read in most forums that more turns will give u more power but u r telling me reduce the number of turns ... how ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternators &amp; how to determine the gauge and length .... if u pls clear me ! <p> On LED headlights you would probably be looking for a bulb that fits the existing headlight . I would see what is available and then work out a circuit to rectify the alternator output , and regulate it . That is the best way to get more light from your headlight . <p> Most alternators are current-limited by the inductance of the windings . The open-circuit voltage ( the voltage that the alternator produces with no load ) is proportional to the speed of the engine . The inductance of the alternator windings is constant , but the frequency is proportional to the speed of the engine , so the impedance of the windings is also proportional to the speed of the engine . <p> The resistance of the bulb is small compared to the impedance of the windings , so impedance of the windings is what controls the current . As the engine speed increased , the open-circuit voltage increases , but so does the impedance , so the current , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The alternators in cars are current-limited in the same way . They have voltage regulators to stop the voltage getting too large when there is less load , but they do n't have current limiters because they do n't need them . When there were dynamos on cars , they did not limit the current , so the dynamo regulators had to contain devices to limit the current as well as the voltage . <p> If you increase the number of turns , the open-circuit voltage will go up , in proportion to the number of turns . If you have twice as many turns you get twice the voltage . However , if you have twice as many turns , the inductance of the windings will be four times as much . <p> So with twice as many turns , you get half the current . Similarly with fewer turns , you get more current . Of course , the engine will have to be going faster before you get full brightness . <p> That is what happened with my motorbike , which was similar , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . The brightness at low engine speeds was poor , but at high engine speeds I was getting the same current with a 12 V bulb as with a 6 V bulb , because the current is controlled by the inductance of the alternator windings and not by the bulb resistance . <p> So with twice as many turns , you get half the current . Similarly with fewer turns , you get more current . Of course , the engine will have to be going faster before you get full brightness . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Thanks for the brief explanation ..... but what about the power ? What theory says , if u increase volts ampere has to be drop and vice versa but output always remain the same .... If i get more current with fewer turns the voltage will drop , hence poor brightness on low rpm . On the other hand if i increase the turns ampere will drop and again there is a problem . Am i right ? If i want to increase volts i wud go for voltage doubler LONG ... but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get more current with fewer turns the voltage will drop , hence poor brightness on low rpm . On the other hand if i increase the turns ampere will drop and again there is a problem . Am i right ? If i want to increase volts i wud go for voltage doubler LONG ... but that does n't  make any sense . <p> What about trying thinner gauge of wire ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> The voltage multipliers wo n't help you increase the power . The wire gauge wo n't make much difference , but it you use wire that is too thin it will reduce the current and it might overheat . <p> You need more current , not more voltage . The standard 12V 35/35 W bulb takes about 3 A and that light up OK . When you tried a 55/60 W bulb , it was very dim , because the alternator was only putting 3 A though the bulb . I think that you measured 35 V from the alternator with no load at high engine speed , so you have plenty of voltage if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much impedance in the winding . You need to reduce the impedance by reducing the number of turns . <p> think that you measured 35 V from the alternator with no load at high engine speed , so you have plenty of voltage if the engine is running fast .

I do n't think that you will get 5 A. The headlight only takes 3 A , and if the alternator can produce 5 A and 20 V it would blow your bulb . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> That is not blowing because of a regulator .... and at the time of test i unplugged the regulator and performed the volt test .... also i ve tested 60W bulb without regulator and i was glowing pretty good , i 'm not sure as many days have passed , but i think it was drawing 4 amperes at 20v . I 'll perform the power test again and will let u know .

I plugged my mobile charger in a 110 V DC socuket outlet and found my charger was working and my mobile ( some chinese make ) was getting charged . My doubt here is 1 ) what will be the impact/ effect on the battery charger of mobile phone ( or ) that of lap top which is designed generally for use in 230 V AC input when I plug it in a 110 V DC socket ? 2 ) In case the charger works when plugged into 110 V DC socket , what is the impact/ effect of the battery of my mobile / laptop If any one can answer with solid derivations based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please let me know <p> Just about all chargers or adaptors that are rated to work over a wide voltage range , for example 100 - 240 V , will be OK on DC . However , 110 V AC will produce about 150 V DC when rectified , so 110 V DC might be too low . <p> A charger that is only rated for one voltage , for example 110 V +/-10 % , will probably not work on DC , and might be damaged by it . <p> The O.P. 's ( original poster ) explanation is totally confusing , at least to me . <p> 1 . You first say that the railroad is providing 110 volt AC outlets for passengers , but then you said you plugged your charger into a 110 volt DC socket . Where was that socket ? Did you mean to say DC ? Are there both AC and DC sockets in the railcars ? Why would you provide 110 volts DC , which is a very strange current ? <p> 2 . Is n't your country ( India ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing 120 ( which is what the actual nominal voltage is ) volt receptacles ? Is n't that mixing apples and oranges ? Or do you use both voltages in India ? <p> ( Note : in order to keep confusion to a minimum here , let 's not get into the minutiae of differences between 110/120 and 220/230/240 volts ; let 's just consider them equivalent and leave it at that . There 's already too much confusion in this thread ! ) <p> If the charger / laptop power supply is the good old-fashioned transformer type , rather than an SMPS type , then it WILL be damaged by plugging it into 110V DC . Your railway will have some very unhappy travellers ! <p> Alec 77973 @qwx697973 <p> small clarification on this discussion .. see the above the figure . in train they mentioned 110 v dc charger for mobile/laptop. but actually output of the socket is 110 v Ac and 50 HZ only . the input of the system is vary from 90 to 140 dc. this type of socket is come with 100 VA inverter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train runs from DC electricity .

It simply means the fuse will open with current exceeding 2 amps rather than 2.5 amps . If the original power cord was 2 wire and you added 2 wire but of a thicker gauge that should be fine also . You just do n't want to go to a lighter ( thinner ) gauge of wire . LEDs can run a little warm . Since we do n't know exactly what they are as to their data sheet there is no easy way to say they are fine but I ca n't see how the changes you did would effect the LEDs . <p> Ron 77976 @qwx697976

The audio is fed into 10k pot acting as an attenuator and then summed with an opamp summing circuit ( where the summing resistors are 4.7k ) . This circuit works perfectly . <p> However , I ran out of 10K pots and I had to use 100K instead . This creates an exaggerated response curve . <p> I tried the simple trick of putting a 10k resistor across terminals 1 and 3 of the 100k potentiometer .

I guess it is making a kind of s-curve response . <p> Is there an easy way to fix this or a better way to make a 100k pot perform exactly like a 10K ? <p> yeah that would be the simplest solution for sure .

For example a voltage follower would do it . <p> The way the resistance changes as the pot arm rotates is such that parallel resistances do n't  allow a linear resistance because the impedance of the pot is too high near the center . <p> The only way to get a 10k pot out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That would give the equivalent of a 10k pot at all arm angles . Obviously 10 pots would be nuts so the active approach would have to be used . <p> A voltage follow can be made with an op amp section and no other resistors are required . A voltage follower can also be made with a single transistor too with no additional resistors , but only if the application can stand a 0.7v voltage drop in line with the signal . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> yeah that would be the simplest solution for sure .

The Vishay 4N35 , which I will assume is typical , will tolerate up to 50mA of DC current and up to 100mA for short durations of 1mSec or less . It will tolerate a voltage of up to 70V . It also will only tolerate a combination of current and voltage up to 0.15 Watts ( current x voltage = watts ) . <p> The AC behavior depends on what shape of AC . The peak current limit would remain the same , 50mA , even though it is going up and down repeatedly and the peak voltage rating would remain the same . The total power that the device could tolerate would have to be adjusted up or down depending on the average RMS voltage multiplied by the RMS current of the AC . <p> One important aspect of an opto coupler is its DC Forward Current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in 10ma with a FCTR of 100% that you will get 10ma collector current .

You do n't  want to drive the LED too high either or its lifetime is significantly lowered and at some point the circuit does n't  work anymore . <p> Also , the switching time is really slow for many optos . This has to be checked also . It speeds up a little with a base resistor , but that steals some of the drive current too so it ends up being a tradeoff between speed and max output current . 77974 @qwx697974

@@71811595 @511595/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> Generally , the tolerance refers to how close the actual capacitance is vs that stated . In this case , the 100uF capacitor with +/- 10% could have a capacitance from 90uF to 110uF . <p> This is quite separate from the voltage the capacitor is rated at - this measures ( roughly ) at what voltage the dielectric that separates the plates will break down and let current flow directly them . <p> Therefore , you need to understand the reason you have a capacitor in that place in your circuit . If it were part of a tuned circuit ( for example ) , then the resonant frequency will be directly related to the capacitance and so you may want the smallest tolerance possible . In your case it looks as though these are only being used as smoothing capacitors in the output of the PSU so the exact value is of lesser concern . On the other hand , you had better get the voltage tolerance well above the output voltage or you will be in big trouble . <p> Thank you Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would have more control over the flucuations . That is all I really needed to know . The caps I will be using in the supply will probably rated from 50-100V just in case . <p> That 's not quite what I said . In your case you are not interested in the actual capacitance and so the tolerance is not really an issue . There are other factors such as the size of the capacitor , how easy it is to mount , the cost etc that would play a bigger part in selecting the one you want to use . <p> In your case , these capacitors are used to stop the large voltage swings when there is a sudden change in the current being drawn ( such as when the device being powered is turned on or off ) . Therefore you want a large capacitance so that it holds a lot of charge that can be released ( or absorbed ) quite quickly - but exactly how much is not really important . <p> There are other uses for capacitors in relation to the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital circuit where the devices are turning on and of very quickly , there can be very large high frequency spikes on top of the DC level . In this case you use capacitors in the nF to low uF range as these have a low impedance at high frequency ( the spikes see them as an easy path and so prefer to go that way ) than at low frequency . These capacitors are usually mounted close to the circuit elements as possible . Again , as you can see by the range I 've just mentioned ( 3 orders of magnitude ) the actual value ( and hence the tolerance ) is not an issue . <p> It is only when you are looking for very precise frequency-dependent operation of a capacitor ( such as in a filter ) that you want to start getting into the tolerance of the capacitor so that the actual device value is close to that you have used in your circuit design calculations . <p> So it matters naught if my capacitor can hold more charge than the circuit design calls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it says 3300uF , it would be safe to use a 3700uF cap . I can also have that cap rated for much higher voltages than you would anticipate being in the circuit to make up for varying power input/draws . Tolerance is only an issue when trying to make an extremely stable power source for things like audio . <p> Even in a very stable power source , larger smoothing capacitors would be better . <p> Where you need a tight tolerance capacitor is in a tuned circuit . If you combine an inductor with a capacitor , you get a tuned circuit that resonates . The resonant frequency depends on the value of the capacitor and the inductor . The usual reason to construct a tuned circuit is to work at that frequency , so tolerance of components matters there . <p> In audio , the capacitors used in crossovers would need to be tighter tolerance , and the circuit would not perform as well if some capacitors were much larger than expected .

Often the AC is removed from an AC/DC mixture , the DC being free to pass through the bypassed component ' . In practice , most digital circuits such as microcontroller circuits are designed as direct current ( DC ) circuits . It turns out that variations in the voltages of these circuits can cause problems . If the voltages swing too much , the circuit may operate incorrectly . For most practical purposes , a voltage that fluctuates is considered an AC component . The function of the bypass capacitor is to dampen the AC , or the noise . Another term used for the bypass capacitor is a filter cap . <p> ? <p> In the chart above , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a by-pass capacitor is installed . Notice that the differences in voltage are pretty small ( between 5 and 10 millivolts ) . This graph represents a small range of 4.95 volts to 5.05 volts . Random electrical noise causes the voltage to fluctuate , as you can see in graph . This is often called ' noise ' or ' ripple ' . The blue line , represents the voltage of a circuit that does n't have a bypass . The pink line is a circuit that has a bypass . Ripple voltages are present in almost any DC circuit . You can see even with the bypass , the voltage does fluctuate , even though it is to a smaller degree . The key function of the bypass capacitor is to reduce the amount of ripple in a circuit . Too much ripple is bad , and can lead to failure of the circuit . Ripple is often random , but sometimes other components in the circuit can cause this noise to occur . For example , a relay or motor switching can often times cause a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level in a pond . The more current the other component uses , the bigger the ripple effect . <p> A fair question to ask is why does this small fluctuation matter ? Gee , is n't the voltage close enough ? The answer depends on the type of circuit you are designing . If you are just running a motor connected to a battery , or perhaps an LED , then chances are the ripple does n't matter much to you . However , if you are using digital logic gates , things get slightly more complex , and this ripple can cause problems in the circuit . <p> Let 's consider for just a moment what the effect of the ripple voltage is . Basic electrical theory tells us that a voltage is a difference in potential . It tells us that a current will flow across this difference in potential . We know that the larger the voltage , the larger the current . We also know the direction of the voltage determines the direction of the current . <p> ? <p> Consider the graphs above . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged to make them easier to see . Just like the previous graph , the blue line represents the circuit without the bypass cap , and the other line is with the bypass cap . By looking along the bottom axis of the graph , you can see that starting at point 2 that the voltage is increasing . By looking in the Ripple Current chart , point 2 shows that the current is a relatively large magnitude in one direction . In contrast , point 5 shows the voltage and current going the other direction . Notice the difference between the values with and without the bypass cap . By dampening the ripple voltage , the bypass cap also dampens the ripple current . I would like to point out that the Ripple Voltage chart and the Ripple Current charts clearly show an alternating current . You can see how the voltage swings , and how the current changes directions . Even though this is is a DC circuit , the ripple is causing an AC component . The bypass capacitor is helping to reduce this AC component . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the circuit . As the fluctuating voltages and currents propogate through the circuit , differences in voltages and currents can occur that cause the circuit to fail . For example , assume that a AND gate is holding its state because the semiconductors that make up the gate are in a stable state . Transistors work by currents flowing one direction through the gate . If the current stops flowing , the transistor shuts down . If a ripple current comes through where the current momentarily flows the wrong direction , the gate will shutdown , and you will see a change it its output . This can cause a cascading failure , because one gate may be connected to many other gates . <p> To summarize , the bypass capacitor is used to dampen the AC component of your DC circuits . By installing bypass capacitors , your DC circuit will not be as susceptable to ripple currents and voltages . <p> Using Bypass capacitors <p> A bypass capacitor on a board ? <p> Many schematics that you find published in magazines and books leave the bypass capacitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other times you will find a little row of capacitors ( caps ) stuck off in the corner of the schematic with no apparent function . These are usually the bypass ( or filter ) caps . If you pickup almost any digital circuit , you will find a bypass capacitor on it . <p> ? <p> The most simple incarnation of the bypass capacitor is a cap connected directly to the power source and to ground , as shown in the diagram to the left . This simple connection will allow the AC component of VCC to pass through to ground . The cap acts like a reserve of current . The charged capacitor helps to fill in any ' dips ' in the voltage VCC by releasing its charge when the voltage drops . The size of the capacitor determines how big of a ' dip ' it can fill . The larger the capacitor , the larger the ' dip ' it can handle . A common size to use is a .1uF capacitor . You will also see .01uF as a common value . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So , how many bypass capacitors do you really need ? A good rule of thumb I like to use is each IC on my board gets its own bypass capacitor . In fact , I try to place the bypass cap so it is directly connected to the Vcc and Gnd pins . This is probably overkill , but it has always served me well in the past , so I will recommend it to you . It turns out you can even by DIP sockets that have the bypass caps built in . I suppose once you reach more than a few capacitors per square inch , you might be able to let up a bit ! <p> Another great place for a bypass cap is on power connectors . Anytime you have a power line heading off to another board or long wire , I would recommend putting in a bypass cap . Any long length of wire is going to act like a little antenna . It will pick up electrical noise from any magnetic field . I always put a bypass cap on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of capacitor you use can be important . I would recommend you use a monolithic ceramic capacitor . They are small , cheap , and readily available . I usually use a .1uF 50Volt +-20% with .1 " or .2 " spacing . Again , .01uF is also acceptable . I would avoid larger voltage capacitors as they are physically too large . Electrolytic capacitors are not well suited to the role of bypass capacitors as they typically have larger capacitance values and do n't respond as well to high frequency changes . <p> ? <p> The frequency of the ripple can have a role in choosing the capacitor value . Rule of thumb is the higher the frequency , the smaller the bypass capacitor you need . If you have very high frequency components in your circuit , you might consider a pair of capacitors in parallel . One with a large value , one with a small value . If you have very complex ripple , you may need to add several bypass capacitors . Each cap is targeting a slightly different frequency . You may even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplitude of the lower frequencys is too great . For example , the circuit on the right is using three different capacitor values in parallel . Each will respond better to different frequencies . The 4.7uF cap ( C4 ) is used to catch larger voltage dips which are at relatively low frequencies . The cap C2 should be able to handle the midrange frequencies , and C3 will handle the higher frequencies . The frequency response of the capacitors is determined by their internal resistance and inductance . <p> Summary <p> Bypass capacitors help filter the electrical noise out of your circuits . They do this by removing the alternating currents caused by ripple voltage . Most digital circuits have at least a couple of bypass capacitors . A good rule of thumb is to add one bypass capacitor for every integrated circuit on your board . A good default value for a bypass cap is 0.1uF . Higher frequencies require lower valued capacitors.

If the metal contains iron it will be pulled by the magnetic field and will probably vibrate at 120Hz with a 60Hz line . It may not be much but it might be enough to make a buzz . So do n't  put it near anything metal if that metal contains some iron . <p> Hum sometimes couples into audio circuits so you 've got to find out where it enters the system if that happens too . Some of the old tube amps used to have an adjustment that you could turn to reduce the hum . The hum often comes from the line frequency coupling into the input of the amp . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> its on a metal plate , since the amplifier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transformer is not an issue , have to be pretty close to hear it . Its a solid sate amplifier I built from scratch , so no tubes and it always was 240V . The buzz couples into the audio circuit . Since I guess the whole housing gets some current induced . The transformer sits on some rubber disks . Its cast in , in a plastic case . So the trough bolt non conductive would help ? For trying how far I have to move the transformer , I first put it straight onto a metal plate and then put some non metal things underneath to lift it up . That will not help much as the transformer will move closer to the lid , once in an enclosure Will changing the angle help , its a circular transformer ? Moving the transformer into a separate housing and feed DC into the amps would be one idea .

I may as well use some in my amps , less trouble <p> Torroids usually come with 2 rubber washers to insulate vibrations , if you do n't  have these then hum might well be an issue . The windings are usually tied real tight with some fibreglass string then varnished &amp; baked , if this wasnt done right that will cause a buzz , not a low hum more of a modulated 50 or 60 hz zzzzz . Also if anything conductive goes around the transformer and through the centre that will be a shorted turn , if you connected the clamp washer to the chassis somehow this would be the same , small voltages at very large current would flow . <p> no , just a through bolt in the centre and nothing metal around .

Crossover is a separate board , disconnected . Has seperate power supply , disconnected . Its starground . I can not see anything on the scope , but its annoying , can hear it from 2m away <p> Ok I get that now . Sounds like the noise is being induced into the amp magnetically , or possibly capacitively . Magnetic coupling is where a conductor is acting like part of a secondary winding and the resultant hum gets amplified . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then maybe its capacitively coupled , which is unusual and would most likely require very high impedances . What is the sheet metal , aluminium would be a good choice . Does the trafo have a screen ? , usually identified by an earth wire going into the windings .

You say the xover is disconnected , is the amp i/p open or did you terminate it ? , if open then this probably would happen . The only thing I can think of other than magnetically shileding the transformer which would be extreme is to RC snubber the primary of the trafo in case a smps or noisy mains device nearby is injecting ac mains modulated hf noise into the primary which is then capacitively coupled to the secondary and radiated ( this can be a problem in smps transformers ) , have you tried powering the amp in a different room ? 77964 @qwx697964 <p> class AB mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , its quiet .

@@71811614 @511614/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Use of the the Count feature <p> If Count is used in a main loop to continuously update number of incoming pulses , the iterations of the loop are held up for the duration the " pulse-collecting " interval , typically 1000 mSec . This suggests that any operation within the same loop , for example a multiplexing loop , is also held up for that interval with undesirable results . Is there any way in which these secondary operations can be continued without interruption by the count operation ? I believe , for example , that there is a feature in Microsoft 's Visual Basic called Do Events which facilitates this . Help here will be much appreciated . <p> Hi Nigel . Thanks for the tip . I 've never used interrupts , but note that Oshonsoft 's Reference Manal has a briefish section on interrupts with a couple of examples which I ca n't begin to understand --yet . I 'll study these to see if I can make any sense of them , but I 'll probably be back I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versed in micros so I do n't understand your drift . I 'm wondering if maybe I did n't make the problem clear . Specifically I 'm trying to produce a frequency counter , the frequency being displayed on a SMA420560 LED display module . The counter , under " Count , " samples the incoming pulses for a second and dumps the number received into a variable . This gives me a direct reading of the source frequency . The value is then processed and for display . <p> The counter operates in a main loop in which there is a second loop which effectively multiplexes the digits of the display module . Unfortunately , at the beginning of the main loop , the counter is refreshed for a second , during which time the loop is held up , which holds up the multiplexing loop , which extinguishes the display module for that second in every iteration of the main loop . I need to prevent this constant periodic extinguishment . So the loop in which the display code resides needs to continue unhampered by the Count refreshing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid , a bit lengthy and convoluted , so I 'm reticent about inflicting it on you patient guys . <p> Steve , you may have to look at Interrupts to prevent main code " delays " . Look into using Timer0 or Timer1 as an interrupt that is PIC clock based , and set it up to count to 1000mS . Most PIC clocks run too fast to make it 1 second with one timer interrupt setup . Set up a interrupt routine , perhaps triggering every 100mS , that counts 10 times to reach 1000mS . Then , look into a pin to interrupt on change ( IOC pin ) , and in that interrupt routine , increment a counter , whether it be a byte , word , or long word . That increment is what you are counting of course .

Some resistors , especially carbon composition can go high resistance with time . <p> You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving 4 7447 ( BCD to 7 segment LED driver/decoder ) which would drive 4 non multiplexed 7 segment LED displays . you would also need a number of gates to pre load the tens of seconds with a count of 5 ( And possibly the seconds counter to a count of 9 depending on how the carry input behaves . ) You would also need to use a diode matrix ( Or a lot of gates ) between the switch and the load inputs of the counters to load the 6 preset values . You would clock this counter with 1 second pulses from a 555 oscillator . There will be a lot of building to do . I think buying a ready built timer would be a better solution . <p> Guys , Ya 'll missed the point ( and the joke , " chips drying out " ? C'm on , I admit I 'm known to be stupid , but not THAT stupid ! ) Also , I never said " no buttons , no batteries " or having just " one simple knob " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cheap timers at the hardware store--you guys are right--the great majority of them are cheap , as in worthless .

The timer I built is a wearable device . It straps to her upper arm so the alarm is close to her ear so she can hear it . She has a hard time , on occasion , standing up and it takes her a while to do so . With a readout of time remaining , she said then she could be ready when the clock runs out . I do n't get it . Does n't anybody like to build something just for the heck of it ? As I said in my original post I 've got probably 90+% of what I might need so cost would be negligible , far less than some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home Depot , or Ace Hardware . My problem is simply that I 'm not smart enough to design something like this . I can build it , heck yes . I know my way around a circuit board and a soldering iron . I just ca n't design it . I 've tried several times to create something digital and I 've gotten spectacular results . Mostly smoke and fire , but sometimes an LED will light up . Usually not the one I want but , meh , I 'll take it . Seriously though , most of the time I get nothing . Which is why I 've got the boxes of logic chips I mentioned in my original post . So , do any of you guys do contract design ? Please forgive any grammar , punctuation or other errors . I 'm not known for my literary skills , either . &lt;ckd&gt; <p> I think everybody here was under the impression that your timer controls a valve on the water supply . Nobody is trying to be sarcastic , and to be honest , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to not know if chips " dry out " ( which as an aside , whilst not relevant to you , is relevant to manufacturers as certain devices can absorb atmospheric moisture over time , potentially causing them to explode when soldered ) . Maybe the easiest route for you is build a " staged " timer . So that there is a warning beep say , 3 minutes before the main one , or whatever interval you want . You could have more warnings , eg a 5 minute one and a 2 minute one for example , before the main alarm . This way your mum does n't have to keep checking the read-out , she just gets told when to start getting up . Simple to implement , just have 1 or 2 extra 555 timers , and use a spare pole on the switch to change the timing capacitor on each one separately . A better implementation would be to have a comparator ( or 2 or whatever ) comparing the voltage on the 555 's timing capacitor to a reference , which then sounds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alarm or else it would be sounding until the whole thing finishes . Others here can give better solutions , this is just the first thing I thought of . <p> I misunderstood what you wanted . I thought that the timer was fixed and controlling a solenoid valve which shut the water off . The approach I suggested in post #5 would be too large to be carried around . ( I think this would be true even using SMD components . ) The only way I can think of displaying the remaining time would be using 10 ( Or more . ) LEDs and the one that was illuminated moved from one end to the other of the row of LEDs . ( This could be done using a CD4017 IC . ) I ca n't think of a way to display minutes and seconds that would be small enough without using a microcontroller . <p> EDIT . Reading throbscottle 's post when I posted this one made me think of another method of displaying the remaining time . It would use an LM3914 bargraph driver IC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffering it , scaling it and applying an offset using op amps . That would drive the 10 LEDs directly <p> Actually , not everyone thought it was controlling a solenoid - spec got the right idea ! It occurs to me you would n't necessarily need a timeout on the sounder - is a " stop " button acceptable ? It could reset a flip-flop ... <p> I have diabetic blindness . I can see well enough to solder things and to type with one finger . But there 's just no way I could type the pages and pages of code for an Arduino . And that 's not even including learning how to write the code I need . I do n't think I have time to consume a book on code-writing . My mom is , after all , 81 . To stop the alarm , I used a latched relay with a NC switch on the ground . The enclosure I used has gobs of room for two or three stacked PCB 's . Granted , small , but doable . More room if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should have enough room . <p> Connect one lead of a high input impedance voltmeter ( multimeter switched to 10V DC range ) to the Control Voltage pin of the LM555 timer and connect the other lead of the voltmeter to the top ( opposite to the 0V side ) of the LM555 timing capacitor . <p> The voltmeter reading will then be proportional to the time gone and the time to go . <p> You could even use an analog multimeter which may be easier to read . <p> If you have any interest in this approach , we can sort out the practical details . <p> Hi ak , The OP wants to build it himself . Most of us thought that he wanted the timer to control the water but he just wants a timer to remind his mother to turn off the water .

The most interesting part about this particular PSU was that it had a fairly ingenious ( not invented by me ) way to have a minimum voltage of 0,00V . For the rest it used adjustable current limiting up to 3A and max output of about 30V . The transformer was an oldfashioned rectangular iron core of about 90VA and two secondary 12V coils , at full current it 's maximum voltage dropped . New specs I set forward for a upgraded PSU : 0,00V minimum output &gt;40V max output 3A max current I had recently bought a toroidal 150VA transformer ( 2x 15V 5A ) , all other parts had to be re-used . On this forum I started a thread LONG ... where , in order of appearance , I received help from Nigel Goodwin , spec , dr pepper , Les Jones and a few others . By far the most prolific contributor had been spec , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all others too . Purpose was to re-use as much as possible from the original design ideas yet increase both current and voltage capabilities , as well as introduce a current limiting warning LED . Another target was to introduce a microcontroller for display and warning purposes . <p> Today , after months of on and off time devoted to this project , I did final " burn-in " tests , you can see on the pictures what I used as a load ( because of the dissipation of max +90W I used watercooling ) . Voltage stays perfectly stable , the transformer does not give a " crimp " , current limiting goes perfect at work at 3.2A , and current limiting is adjustable too ; no molten or burnt components during tests .. <p> On the picture of the pcb ( see below ) to the right is a socket that is reserved for a Atmega168P controller : display of V and I ( current measured with INA219 I2C module ) and transformer and heatsink temperature sensors ( LM35 ) , as well as supervision of temperatures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet installed at time of picturetaking ) is meanwhile installed and all performs well , I just need to do voltage and temperature calibrations . <p> Included too is the final schematic drawing ( thank you to spec who introduced me to CAD with Eagle ) . <p> C++ program files and microcontroller hardware layout available on demand . These are not included in this schematic for readability purposes . <p> The 723 is , like the 555 , one of those ancient devices which simply refuses to go away . <p> The reason being that one can make them do a myriad things that were never envisioned by their original designers , thanks to a simple and straightforward architecture . All it takes is a little study of the IC innards and some analog design knowledge . That and the willingness to perform some calculations , and presto ! you have a nice circuit like what you are showing here . <p> All that you require now , is to dress up the wires and anodize the case and you 'll have an awesome project to show off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine is very similar , for obvious reasons . I spent some time improving the current limit function as the built in limit in the ' 723 is a bit noisy . So briefly what 's the purpose of the lm393 , looks like a current limit indicator . Also mine displays wattage , its simple to do in code and I find it usefull , for rating power supplies and getting an idea of heatsinks for circuits under test . I sometimes leave min on charging batteries and things , so I 've thought about revisiting and getting the uC to shut down the ' 723 on a transformer or heatsink overtemp , just for safety . <p> Here is an upgrade to the schematic ( thank you spec ! ! ) : added output protection diodes D1 and D2 . <p> Also make sure the heatsink on Q6 is big enough , temperature can climb on that darlington ( on the picture it is the one with the black heatsink inside the case now ) . Before the change it went to +95C , currently it stays at 62C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicator , with thanks to spec ! <p> Cleaning up the wiring ? I make sure they do n't touch heatsinks but I leave the rest as is , it is already a major undertaking getting the pcb in and out without all wires strapped and bundled . <p> To dr pepper : shutting down the LM723 is doable but to restart it would you use a reset button or let the software take care ? <p> For my 0.00 volt power supply I just short the two power leads together . <p> I 'm not sure what the current limit is at 0.00 volts but when I hooked up my pair of 600 amp continuous duty rated three phase Miller welding power supplies to my 0.00 volt power supply in parallel and turned them up all the way it had to be approaching near infinity being they normally will pull something like 35 KW each on 480 VAC three phase when shorted out . 77965 @qwx697965 <p> ... but when I hooked up my pair of 600 amp continuous duty rated three phase Miller welding power supplies to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way it had to be approaching near infinity being they normally will pull something like 35 KW each on 480 VAC three phase when shorted out . <p> Looks ok . Does the current limit led come on at the precise point of current limit ? , I went a bit ott on my design , in the end I just put an led in series with the input to the current limit integrator which deliberately had a low i/p impedance so the led had to be on as current limit came in effect .

With typical 8051 applications , it is often necessary to access individual bits within an SFR . The sbit type provides access to bit-addressable SFRs and other bit-addressable objects . For example : <p> sbit EA = 0xAF ; <p> This declaration defines EA as the SFR bit at address 0xAF .

This is the storage format of the sfr16 type but it is opposite to the storage of int and long data types . Care must be taken when using sbit to access bits within standard data types . <p> Any symbolic name can be used in an sbit declaration . The expression to the right of the equal sign ( ' = ' ) specifies an absolute bit address for the symbolic name . There are three variants for specifying the address : <p> Variant 1 sbit name = sfr-name bit-position ; <p> The previously declared SFR ( sfr-name ) is the base address for the sbit . It must be evenly divisible by 8 . The bit-position ( which must be a number from 0-7 ) follows the carat symbol ( ' ' ) and specifies the bit position to access . For example : <p> sfr PSW = 0xD0 ; sfr IE = 0xA8 ; <p> sbit OV = PSW2 ; sbit CY = PSW7 ; sbit EA = IE7 ; <p> Variant 2 sbit name = sfr-address bit-position ; <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sbit .

Using switches gives an approximation but the colours are a bit off - eg yellow is more a lime green . <p> I 'm trying to find suitable resistors to make it more convincing , but here I 've encountered a problem . When changing the brightness of the Red component it goes from red to off and back to red again as I turn the pot ( 10k ) . <p> I 'm attaching the circuit layout to see if this is basically wrong ( I have n't really studied electronics for 30 years ! ) <p> Thanks in advance 77964 @qwx697964 <p> The most likely reason the red LED goes off again is because you are not limiting the current and the die overheats to the point that the light output drops off so much that you ca n't see it . Either that or you have burned one end o f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overheating and possibly ruining the LEDs and burning your pots , you really should have a fixed resistor in series with each LED .

Without limiting the current then it might have been hundreds or thousands of mA . I bet the LED and the pot are burned out . The power supply voltage is not mentioned . With a 9V battery and a current of 20mA in the 1.8V red part of the LED then a resistance of ( 9V - 1.8V ) /20mA= 360 ohms or 330 ohms should be in series with the pot . The total resistance of 10,360 ohms will cause dimming but the LED will still be very visible . <p> EDIT : The green part and our vision are more sensitive than the red part so turn down the green level instead of overdriving the red . 77964 @qwx697964 <p> Your color balance is bad because the pots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushbuttons instead of 10k pots . When a 10k pot is connected properly as a rheostat then it adjusts from 0 ohms smoothly to 10 thousand ohms .

@@71811621 @511621/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> I have an electromagnet made from a Microwave oven transformer . I am only using the coil with the thicker wire . I 've separated the transformer core into the " E " shaped bit and the " keeper " shaped bit and removed the other coil . When I turn the current off , I would like the attractive force between the two halves of the core to decay more quickly than it does at present . <p> The magnet is powered by a 6V lead acid battery . I turn the magnet off using a Crydom DC60S3 SSR controlled by the DTR line of the serial port on a laptop . I 've written a simple Perl programme to turn it off . <p> Following advice I 've found online and in the local electronics shop I currently have a diode across the coil to allow the back emf to do its thing and not damage the Crydom . The diode says : GW506 IN5404 on it . <p> I have a 7 ohm resistor in the circuit to reduce the strength of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance of the coil as zero , so I assume that it is less than 1 ohm ( or less than 0.5 depending on how it does its rounding ) .

Maximum Turn-Off Time msec =0.3 ( but that is under the heading " Input Specs " ) I ca n't find information about how long the Crydom takes to go from " conducting " to " not conducting " on the output side . My meter is telling me that the coil current is 0.7 A. <p> During use , the coil is energised for approximately 45 seconds , then turned off . It is n't re-energised for about 30 seconds after that . <p> My priorities are : - the attractive force between the two parts of the core to fall away as quickly as possible . - not damaging the Crydom <p> I do n't care about : - energy efficiency - time for the magnet to gain its attractive force ( if less than 5 seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnet by hanging it vertically with a known weight on it ( 15kg ) and measuring the time taken for the two parts of the transformer core ( the " E " shaped bit and the " keeper ) to separate after the PC turns the Crydom off .

I would like to get it down to less than 0.05 seconds if possible ! <p> I 'm looking for advice on circuits and component values for a snubber circuit which might help me get there ( or any other means ! ) I did " A " level physics 35 years ago so the theory comes back to me when I read stuff on the internet , but I 'm just too rusty to sensibly calculate values . <p> If you get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this , this is the reason : I am building a Track Cycling start gate for my son . The " E " shaped part of the transformer core is ( indirectly ) attached to a fixed post and the " keeper " bit is ( indirectly ) attached to the bike . The Laptop generates the countdown " beeps " and triggers the Crydom at time=T0 , then records the separation time with the other circuit . In the future I want to measure the forward displacement of his hips during the " start " phase ( pre time=T0 ) and of the bike ( post time=T0 ) so that we can plot velocity , acceleration jerk and momentum and compare it to frame by frame video from the side and the " separation " time above . Should be fun . <p> Hi Geoff , I think it is unlikely that the turn off time of the SSR is the cause of your problem . I think the problem is that the diode across the coil to protect the SSR from back emf from the coil works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy in the inductance of the coil is lost . ( Via heat in the coil resistance and the forward volts drop of the diode . ) Adding a resistance in series with the diode should help but the resistor value must not be so high that the voltage developed across is would be enough to exceed the voltage rating of the SSR . The voltage rating of the SSR is 60 volts so I would limit the voltage to about 45 volts . As you say that the current is 0.7 amps then the maximum safe value of resistance would be 45/0.7 = 64 ohms . Although the average power disipated in the resistor will be very low the peak power will be about 31 watts . I would choose at least a 5 watt resistor. ( probably wire wound . ) . <p> For fast turnoff of a coil you need to rapidly dissipate the inductive coil energy . The fastest way to do this is to add a zener in reverse series with the 1N5404 diode ( anode to anode ) . The zener generates a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to more rapidly dissipate the inductive energy in the coil and drop to zero coil current . With just the 1N5404 diode , the energy is dissipated only in the diode forward drop and the coil resistance . <p> The zeners value should be such as to not exceed the relay 's 60V rating . With a 6V battery , this means the zener voltage should be no more than about 50V or so.Here 's a 51V , 5W zener that should handle the 0.7A current pulse when the switch opens . <p> Would I be correct in thinking that both the Zener and the resistor are both doing the same thing ( providing a resistance ) , but while the resister behaves according to Ohm 's law the Zener has a high effective resistance until we get to 51V but then the voltage does n't need to increase much as the current increases considerably . In either case we do n't care about current flow in the other direction , because the standard diode prevents it . <p> I 'll try to get these components and try them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that these 2 solutions work separately and I wo n't try them together ! <p> Hi Geoff , The zener will be slightly better than the resistor . If you wanted to make it even faster you would need a switching device ( SSR mosfet or transistor. ) with a higher voltage rating which would allow you to use a higher value resistor or higher voltage zener . You are correct that you should use either of these solutions but not both . <p> Here are some observations about your system- do not take any of what I say personally- I only mean to help . <p> Using an RS232 serial interface DTR line for accurate timing can have problems- RS232 is not a real time interface and is specifically designed to have slow edges . <p> The other problem with RS232 lines is that they are only required to provide 5V/3K= 1.66mA and the Croydon solid state relay ( SSR ) type DC6053 requires a minimum turn on current of 2.2mA . But , a typical PC ( personal computer ) , including laptop , RS232 interface line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RS232 specification minimum limit . <p> So that sets the scene : you say that the solenoid ( microwave oven transformer MOT ) is taking in the order of 0.3 Secs to de-energize . The problem is that your method of measuring the de-energize delay may not be accurate due to the non real-time nature of the laptop PEARL/RS232 route . <p> My advice , to assist a resolution to your problem , is to measure the signal across the solenoid and compare that with the time that the solenoid bar actually separates from the rest of the transformer core . An oscilloscope would be ideal to display the signal across the solenoid but , failing that , a moving coil multimeter ( set to the volts range ) , or a high efficiency LED and suitable series resistor may suffice . <p> Incidentally , along the lines that Les described in post #2 , you could try this : instead of connecting the stubber diode directly across the solenoid , you could try connecting the snubber diode across the solenoid and the seven-Ohm current limiting resistor ( anode connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery positive terminal ) . <p> A 5H inductor with an initial current of 5A . The diode represents the typical diode snubber . Vz represents adding a Zener of various voltages . The first case , ( Green traces ) , is when Vz=0 , or no Zener at all ; just the snubber diode . Note that with these values , it takes almost 30s for the current I(L1) to decay . It is hard to see on trace , but the voltage V(c) is clamped at 1V ( forward drop of a Si diode ) . <p> As Vz is stepped to 12V ( red traces ) , the current I(L1) decay time is cut dramatically to 2s , while the voltage V(c) is clamped at 12V+one diode drop . <p> As Vz is stepped to progressively higher voltages ( 25 , 50 , 100 ; blue , violet , yellow traces ) , the decay time is cut even more , but at the expense of V(c) going higher and higher . The voltage rating of whatever is switching the current in the inductor must accommodate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much jubilation , I reran the sim for 2s , and plotted the power in the simulated Zener V1 ( top plot pane , same color scheme ) , and in the diode D1 ( bottom plot pane ) . The energy stored in the inductor has to go some where ! Where are you gon na find a 25W to 100W Zener ? <p> Note that the area under all of the Zener dissipation curves is constant ... <p> Last edited : Feb 26 , 2017 77970 @qwx697970 <p> Here is a way of shifting the power dissipation into a power transistor .

And if it fails to low resistance then I 'll be back to a slow release with just the original diode . Is that correct ? <p> Can I put 5 off 10V Zeners in series to get an effective 50V Zener ?

It was one of those things that just grew and grew . I kept going down this route , because a previous version with a much smaller magnet recorded a disconnect time in my drop tests of a a few milli seconds , and this was good enough . But that magnet was n't strong enough , so I got the bigger magnet and all this started ! <p> If a Zener is damaged by the power level , does it fail to high resistance or low resistance ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I think they usually fail shorted . The high power damages the junction and it ceases to act as a diode , but just becomes a conductor . <p> Given the time to release you observed of 0.25 to 0.35 seconds with just a diode , I would expect your inductance is less than a Henry . It that case a 5W , 45V zener should be able to dissipate the energy of 0.7A through that inductance without damage ..

( For a reactance of 1 ohm you would need 5.3 nF but you would probably need much less than 1 ohm reactance so for 0.1 ohm you would need 53 nF . ) If it did not need to operate over a wide frequency range you could cancel out the capacitve reactance with a series inductor ( Forming a series tuned circuit . ) With 5.3 nF capacitor you would need an inductor of 5.3 nH ( With a standard value of 4.7 nF you would need a 6.0 nH inductor . ) <p> Hi MikeMl , My suggestion is definitely no good for that frequency range .

They were from only one vendor ( a Japanese company ) and could stand a lot of RF current , and were a vivid green colour , but that 's not much help . I think that porcelain caps might be the way to go nowadays , especially those with the larger soldering tabs as these offer very good heat sinking and are compatible with microstrip layout . For example , the ATC series 100 caps include RF current graphs in their spec , and 4.5 amps is within their range . <p> Need to block 20Vdc but pass an RF rms current of 4.5A @30MHz .

No single formula can be used to design every possible type of relay . 77967 @qwx697967 77973 @qwx697973 <p> Just wind 30 turns on a rod and then get other wire and wind 30 turns and see if the length is the same . No dial-micrometer needed . Just intelligence . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> And an excess of wire , as well as a wide selection in order to find the proper gauge .

So you can pick up 50 ohm speakers for almost nothing . When you test them in an amplifier , the output is almost the same . The reason is a speaker works on the principle of AMP-TURNS . The magnetic flux produced by the coil interacts with the permanent magnet to move the cone . The multiplication of the number of turns on an 8 ohm coil and the current delivered by a circuit to drive it , it almost the same as the number of turns on a 50 ohm coil and the current .

It is true that the relay itself works more or less like that , but we also have to match the coil up with what we have to drive it with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coil is wound with the chosen wire size and number of turns and core material so that at the chosen voltage the current is right to pull the relay arm in toward the coil , and without drawing excessive current from the power supply .

Short/long vs lower/higher . Probably and English thing . Short/long usually refers to element length and wavelength . e.g. shortwave . Then taller/shorter can also refer to antenna height . The words by themselves are ambiguous . <p> Long wavelengths bounce off of the ionosphere better . <p> Tall antennas have less obstructions . FM has a tendency to bounce and thus Multipath distortion comes into play when the same signal arrives at different times . There is also dead zones . In a car stopped at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station to get much louder <p> Antennas can be polarized where the orientation - horizontal/vertical or both , or circular will change the strength of the signal . TV/FM is USUALLY horizontal . <p> Hi bhuvaneshnick , First of all , a minor correction . In post #1 , either the frequency or the wavelength is wrong . A wavelength of 354 metres corresponds to a frequency of 869 kilohertz not megahertz . Conversely , a frequency of 840 MHz corresponds to a wavelength of 0.354 metres . These are important distinctions because of the frequency dependence of radio wave propagation . And since the above correction is simply a side-issue to the main thrust of your question , ignore it , and instead have a look at the following pages : <p> thanks.now consider two things 1 ) am ( low frequency ) antenna are taller and fm ( high frequency ) antenna are shorter 2a ) am haev low wavelength so it tend to follow the curvature and t has difrracted through object due it low wavelength then why the antenna need to be taller ab ) fm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not not be shorter becuase it can not bend.so its supposed to talller ( like point to point communication ) <p> is my thought bad 77968 @qwx697968 <p> If you want a " keep it simple stupid " answer . yes you are right . <p> If you want a NOT simple answer . 1 ) There is a difference between " antenna " and " tower " . Every AM broadcast station I have seen uses the tower as a antenna . FM radio does not use the tower as a antenna . It is not good to have a 10 foot antenna/tower . That is why FM uses a small antenna on a tall tower . 2 ) The antenna needs to be a length so the electricity travels from one end of the antenna in 1/2 cycle or 1.5 cycles or 1 cycle or ..... ( depends on type of antenna ) The antenna should resonate at the frequency you are transmitting at . Sorry for the bad pictures . Here are some examples . 3 ) I do not understand . Here is a picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The antenna pieces are about 6 inches long . ( left to right ) This antenna is 6 feet long . On a pipe to hold it high in the air . <p> 1 . The frequency : This determines the length of the antenna needed to transmit and receive the signal . It also effects the height above ground and that influences the take-off angle for the transmission . It also allows maximum transmitted power output . <p> 2 . Yes . The lower the frequency , the more it can bend around the earth or reflect off the ionosphere . The higher the frequency , the shorter the antenna , the more direct the transmission . It bends less . <p> 3 . Yes . The way the antenna is orientated provides polarization . If you want to receive the best signal from a transmitter , then , you need to have the same type of antenna and the same orientation . <p> 4 . The closer to ground that you place your dipole , the more upwards is directed the radiated energy . And the shorter its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be raised to a height where they can transmit further around the curvature of the earth . <p> If you mean why is the AM band at a low frequency and the FM band at a much higher frequency , it has to do with history and bandwidth . The first commercial broadcasts were AM since AM is very simple to generate and receive . They were done at low frequency because it was easier to build low-frequency transmitters and receivers and the low frequency wave had a long reception distance as explained in post #8 . The bandwidth of the AM signal was also selected to be low ( adequate for voice but with corresponding low music fidelity ) so many stations could be crammed into the 1 MHz width of the AM band . <p> When FM went commercial in the USA it was designed for high fidelity and low noise so the bandwidth of each station became about 250kHz , 25 times that of the AM stations ( thus only 4 FM stations could fit in the AM band ) . This required that the broadcast frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandwidth for a reasonable number of stations . The selected range was 87.5MHz to 108MHz or about 20 times the width of the AM band . <p> A side note about long distance transmission of AM signals : When I was a kid in Wisconsin I remember that most nights I could clearly pick up KWKH in Shreveport , Louisiana on my AM clock radio ( internal antenna ) which is about 1000 air-miles distant . Of course KWKH is a Clear Channel station ( no other station in the country on that frequency at night ) broadcasting with 50,000 watts of power so that helped with the reception . <p> Very true . But the question asked is about the length of the antenna to transmit and receive radio signals . You have all heard of half wave antenna , quarter wave , eighth wave etc : Well , the lower the operating frequency then the longer the wave length of the signal . This means that am transmissions use longer in length wires to transmit the radio frequency ( rf ) . Amplitude modulated signals are found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Very high frequency ( VHF ) lies in the 30 to 300 MHz range and is used for frequency modulation . Now to work out the wave length of a sine wave at any frequency , we divide the speed of light by the frequency of the rf signal . Antenna are set up to be friendly with a particular wave length . There is a natural resonance when the wave length and the length of antenna are in agreement ... are related to each other . i.e 1/2 , 1/4 , 1/8 etc . From memory , the speed of light is 3 multiplied by 10 to the eighth power or 30,000,000 meters per second . When you divide by the frequency ( say 25,000,000 Hz or 25 to 10 by power 6 or 25 MHz ... The antenna for a one wave length is 30 over 25 or 1.2 meters . The wave length of a 3 MHz signal is 12m long . This is very long ; hence the use of fractional antenna . Omni directional antenna radiate in a full 360 degree pattern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is important to aim them in the direction you want to send . Also ... and this is important , the height above the ground plane of the dipole effects the take off angle of the transmission . Hence there is a thing called near vertical transmissions . <p> With HF : there are ground wave , sky wave and space wave transmissions . Hf travels the furthermost being able to circumnavigate the planet in some instances . <p> Antenna are set up to be friendly with a particular wave length .

@@71811638 @511638/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> A field service rep at my facility today was servicing our equipment and took a call from another customer . The other customer 's equipment is on a 220 volt service with a double pole breaker labeled 20 Amp on each pole . <p> Evidently there has been an ongoing problem with this breaker . The equipment in question is rated for 40 amp service . <p> I 'm no electrician i.e. building power distribution and wiring , but I do understand that in the US 220 volt circuits are fed out of phase with two parallel 110 volt legs . My understanding was that 20 amps drawn from either leg would trip the breaker in unison since they are connected . <p> But the question that came up , is this considered a 40 amp service or 20 amp service ? Is the rating of the breaker the COMBINED rating or the max rating for either leg ? <p> So , if I were looking at a breaker with two poles , each labeled " 20 " , how many amps on either leg would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important to understand based on the rating of the equipment . It is foreign manufactured for European standard 220 volts , which is single phase as I understand it . I am not European , but I would assume that European breakers are single pole switches . <p> Thanks if you know the answer . <p> Edit : The reason why I mentioned the difference between European and US ratings is because if the equipment was labeled for Europeans using single phase power , then 20 amps would be literally 20 amps on a single pole switch . My thought process is that with a 2 phase system , each leg is protecting its own leg of the circuit . 20 amps drawn through either leg would trip it , so in effect the " trip current " is 20 amps .... yet , let 's say for discussion the load was drawing near maximum rating through each leg ... would the total load of the service be around 40 amps ? <p> It confuses me because we are n't talking about parallel legs from the same voltage source , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two voltages fed out of phase . My logic says that the total current would STILL be the sum of each phase leg , but I do n't fool with 220 AC very much so I 'm confused . <p> A 2 pole 20 ampere breaker is called a 20 amp breaker . It is just 2 single pole 20 ampere breakers tied together at the factory with an internal " common trip " mechanism . More than 20 amperes on either leg will trip both . <p> US single phase power is generally center tapped 240v ( 120 on each leg ) . Three phase is generally 120/208 or 277/480 . With single phase power the phase to phase voltage is 2x the line to neutral voltage . With three phase the phase to neutral voltage is the phase to phase voltage divided by the square root of three . you can work out the proof in with trigonometry if your into that sort of thing . <p> If the equipment in question is rated for a 40 ampere service , they have the wrong breaker . Take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , multiply by 1.25 and round up to the next standard breaker . <p> It confuses me because we are n't talking about parallel legs from the same voltage source , thus all currents add together .

Your confusing amperage with power . Let 's say we have 2 motors , one 120v and one 240v , each have a full load amperage of 5 amperes . Let 's assume unity power factor ( which would n't be the case with a motor ) . The 120 volt motor is dropping 120v lead to lead at 5 amps , so using Ohm 's law we get 120x5=600 watts . The 240v motor is using 240x5=1200 watts - twice the power on the meter . <p> The voltages are not " out of phase " , your still dealing with one sine wave , it just has twice the magnitude . The mirror image sine wave your picturing does not exist because the motor does not use the neutral center tap point of the system . <p> smanches not if the center tap is grounded you 'll have L1 ground and L2 L1 and and L2 will both be 120 volts to ground , but theyl'l be 180 degrees out of phase giving you 240 volts when used together .

OK I think I 'm picturing this but it is still sort of mind blowing because I always had it wrong I 'm thinking . <p> I was doing a mental excercise with my voltmeter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seing 240 on the meter . In my mind , I 'm looking at two in-phase hot wires going up and down together . At any point between the 2 , the voltage would be 120 volts . <p> But then I thought , my meter does n't work that way , it is a true RMS meter , that 's the key , right ? <p> Because to get 120 volts on an AC RMS meter , at time x , the peak is 60 volts above neutral , and at time x+1 , the valley is 60 volts below neutral . So , my drawing throws all of that off , because the meter ca n't see it as a sine wave . <p> The center tapped 240 volt transformer is the most correct definition . Being that center tap is also used as the common reference and earth ground point in most systems that makes it so that only a maximum AC voltage potential of 120 Volts AC is possible in reference to the common line and earth ground planes from a single line . To get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the load . a double pole circuit breaker is 20 amps per line . That equals the same power of a single 40 amp 120 volt line . 77965 @qwx697965 <p> Its very wierd , having thought incorrectly for all these years makes it hard to even picture this , but All About Circuits has a nice tutorial that makes sense of it . I never even realized that the transformer secondary outside my home was 240 and center tapped . I see it clearly now what is happening . Doh ! ! ! <p> The neutral wire is what throws it all off , makes it counter intuitive . It does n't seem to serve any purpose on the 240 circuit that I can see . It is what caused me to believe the voltages had to be out of phase all these years . <p> Mark , people do some pretty stupid stuff with extension cords/power strips .

Just as an example someone wires an extension chord to two seperate outlets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on it 'll power the strip/device . This is perfectly fine if they 're both the same branch circuits because they 're in phase , so you 'll only get a little bit of current from the voltage drop difference in the two circuits , but it 'll work . If you connect two different branches together it would also work fine , as long as only one was ever on at the same time , turn on both at the same time and the two 180 degrees phases will add up to 220V 's and the extensio cord will be a dead short , it 'll draw a fair bit of current before the breaker trips . 77966 @qwx697966

@@71811640 @511640/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> There are numerous advantages to using tantalum capacitors over other types of capacitors . First , tantalum capacitors have a higher volumetric efficiency ( CV/cc ) when compared to other types of capacitors . For instance , a 10-microfarad tantalum capacitor can replace a 100-microfarad aluminum capacitor . Tantalum capacitors are easily mounted onto circuit boards , and give engineering designers the ability to place these components in closely-confined printed circuit board space , as well as utilizing tantalum capacitors ' excellent power dissipation characteristics . Second , tantalum capacitors have superior frequency characteristics than many other types of capacitors , including aluminum electrolytics . A comparable CV tantalum capacitor has an ESR ten times better than an aluminum electrolytic capacitor . Third , tantalum capacitors are highly reliable " electrical performance qualities do not degrade over time . Tantalum capacitors do not lose capacitance unlike electrolytic capacitors " in fact , the shelf life for tantalums is regarded as unlimited . Fourth , tantalum capacitors do n't wear out " in fact , if there is an imperfection in the dielectric layer of a tantalum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convert to a form that is even more resistive . The new oxide form plugs up the faulty region and results in a reduction in current flow . Finally , tantalum capacitors have an excellent wide operating range , from " 55 degrees Centigrade to +125 degrees Centigrade , with a minimal amount of degradation in electrical properties throughout this range . <p> They were only ever used for a small number of years in domestic electronics , their huge failure rate caused all manufacturers to stop fitting them . Personally the only place I 'd consider using one is as the timing capacitor on a 555 - where their lower leakage is a great advantage . <p> In fact they do n't tolerate voltage peeks and may explode if their ratings are exceeded . On the other hand , they are more precise , stable and suitable for higher frequencies . I 've recently used tantalum capacitors after LDO regulators because of their low ESR . <p> They were only ever used for a small number of years in domestic electronics , their huge failure rate caused all manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd consider using one is as the timing capacitor on a 555 - where their lower leakage is a great advantage . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I 'm not sure what you 're saying . Tantalums have been the capacitor of choice for many years and are used almost exclusively in many consumer electronics products . Their size is the primary advantage , like the description says , not only is a cap in a similar voltage and capacitance much smaller , but due to the lower ESR the tantalum can often be of a much smaller capacitance . MP3 players are almost all tant . Hard drives , tants . <p> In fact a big issue is that tantalum only comes from one part of the world , a somewhat unstable part at that , and most electronics depend so heavily on tant caps that it 's become a real concern . Awhile back I saw they were working hard to develop vanadium caps as a substitute for tantalum primarily due to supply issues . <p> I 'm not sure what you 're saying . Tantalums have been the capacitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many consumer electronics products . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Just checked six different TV 's , from a brand new LCD one to one 12 years old - ca n't see a single tantalum capacitor in any of them . In fact I 've not seen any since the late 70 's early 80 's when they were dropped because of their poor reliability . Also just checked a digital satellite receiver , a DVD player , a 40Gb HDD , and a PC motherboard - none in those either . <p> Just checked six different TV 's , from a brand new LCD one to one 12 years old - ca n't see a single tantalum capacitor in any of them .

Do n't be the grampa who talks about how color TV picture tubes go out too soon because he saw them do that in the early days . Tech does n't work like that . A product can easily be unreliable or impractical for a few years and then totally change . <p> Fact is tants are actively being used in LOTS of stuff . They 've been the hot component that is essential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ! There are no really problematic " gotchas " to them , at least not for the past 5 years . Ca n't say why you 're not seeing them in the items you have picked up , but you got ta look around- they 're used , and they 're used in lots of stuff ! <p> Generally do n't show up as often in non-space-critical items like a TV , they 're a bit more expensive .

However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturers literature ? - it would certainly explain why they fail and require changing ! <p> Now remember what you saw 20 yrs ago is not a permanent state of tech .

A product can easily be unreliable or impractical for a few years and then totally change . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Agreed , but the manufacturers do n't seem to want to get bitten again , as I say , I do n't really see any . <p> I use Thousands of tantalums in my projects and have Never had one fail . ( Unless Connected in Backwards by Mistake ) <p> But Most important is to know " Where " and " Where-Not " to use them . <p> They were never ment to be a Blocking Capacitor for AC Signals . <p> As Bypass Caps on " Voltage Requlators " , they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should use here as they are Not ment for Brute Force Filtering . ( Generally speaking they should be placed Directly across the input and Output of the actual regulator IC , Thus Complimenting the supply of the additional Electrolytic filter caps . ) <p> They also work very well for Bypassing IC Supplies , Directly across the IC 's Supply Pins . <p> Actually electrolytics themselves bit mfgs about 5 yrs back . One of the big Asian mfgs of components supposedly stole a formula for electrolytics but only got part of the formula . Bad caps saturated the industry and nobody knew . Those caps went into most of the motherboards for quite a while . Then they all started to go out , caps leaking crap all over . I have a prime example . <p> Look on Digikey , the ratio of hits for electrolytics to tants is about 2:1 . Note that tants cover a more limited range- there are no high voltage or super-high capacity tants , so fewer types are expected . But you got ta see that 7400+ types available does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You 'll also find in many spec sheets ( for a regulator for example ) they specify " low ESR electrolyic or tantalum type " . Sometimes they say if you do n't use a tantalum you may need a ceramic in parallel with an electrolytic to meet both the ESR and capacitance spec . That 's sort of half-assed when you think about it . The ceramic has a low ESR but only a capacity of like 0.1uF at best which only counters high freq ripple . A tant has low impedance for all of its capacitance . <p> I 've used plenty of tants in my projects . They do work well and I 've only had one fail because it was in backwards . I greatly prefer them for their small size and low ESR . <p> I have heard not to use a tant for a continuous voltage of more than like half the peak voltage rating . I am unsure how universal that recommendation is . I mean that may or may not have been true for one mfg , but is it true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cap spec sheets . I do see 16v as a popular voltage , yet I have to note that there are few 8v circuits out there that would justify its popularity . And that 's too far off to be intended for regulated 5v circuits . It suggests people might be using these for a regulated 12v line to me . <p> You 're pretty much guaranteed to see tantalum capacitors in use in any height/space constrained device . They come in thicknesses from 1.2mm to 6mm , while " cans " start at 8mm for the smallest capacitances . There are some high capacitance ceramic parts , but they come with their own baggage . <p> Niobium capacitors are the new tantalum alternatives . They have lower capacities , but also do n't go up in flames when stressed . Keep in mind that standard tant 's may be " stressed " if the voltage is n't derated by 100% ! ( A tantalum on a 12V line wants to be rated at 25V , etc . ) <p> There are also " organic polymer " versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better reliability for a higher price - although the only applications which really benefit are high density power supplies . <p> Interesting . I have 2 tantalums in my whole collection , both 16v 10uf . I bought them for some mic 's that reccomended them . I then read about unreliability both here and on Rod Elliot 's site and have never actually installed them . I currently have one across an ADC 's power supply ( currently on breadboard ) . I am hoping to not need it on the " real " version which has a 100uf low impedence electrolytic ( suitable for SMPS type ) nearby . I also read the tantalum comes from a Gorilla habitat and that it is damaging that habitat by us taking it ? 
@@71811641 @511641/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> When you go a " little earlier " than the start of the article , NI developed hardware and software drivers for the PDP-11 and oddly enough , I had aPDP-11 background from High school and college , just not at the real-time level . <p> The " growing pains " started when , the boss said we had to modernize our testing from BCD interfaced meters and x-y recorders . A minor jump was eliminating the BCD instruments and convert to IEEE-488 . So , guess what ? The testing process got SLOWER . But , the BCD meters were getting obsolete . <p> The next part of the process was eliminating the X-Y recorders . My comment was " The software we need is n't here yet , but boss said the money was " . <p> NI had introduced LabView on the MAC and with IEEE-488 we cobbled together what parts we had and made a platform change . I wanted an SMU based system , but was told no . This was basically cost and we were building two systems , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swapped out one item while the other was being repaired during it 's 17 year life . The MAC never lost a hard disk . Just one floppy drive , some dust and a fan . A server for data was nixed . <p> A MAC server maintained by us and a Linux based SMB server ( maintained and backed up by our IT department ) did show it 's face . <p> Slow as usual . The conception was to print tests as they were done , but that turned out to be impractical . The printer did better spitting out stuff continuously rather than warming up . Laser printers were new too . <p> Trying to be a manager and developing some custom hardware ( all related ) for yet another system was basically too much for me . I had one inexperienced person as myself basically working under me , So , I was overwhelmed . <p> So , me choosing LabVIEW and the MAC paved the department 's use of Mac computers for primarily desktop publishing . I liked the MAC 's flat memory model and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.3 for Windows ) . Microsoft Word was developed for the Mac market until the PC caught up . <p> The PC caught up and other instrument now had PC Centric interfaces/programs . In another system I was TOLD to use cards in a MacIIx based system to computerize something . I did not want to do that , I was over-ruled , Bad move . Slots from Macs and PC 's disappeared . <p> The 17 YO system got overhauled again with SMU 's like I wanted . I did not do the programming . An interface to Excel now existed rather than comma separated data , so individual tests and summary data was available for each test . This one was PC based . Still slow . <p> Unlike the previous system where data was displayed as acquired ( which was also a slow process ) , you had to wait 2 minutes to see if the data was good . I guess in the grand scheme of things , one could use meters with a graphical display now . <p> labview made it impossible to plot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , then for point 2 , 1&amp;2 ; for point 999 , point 0-998 for 999 points 0-999 ; real slow on say a 66 Mhz machine . <p> NI kept updating stuff during the development and went from a MAC only model to a Linux/MAC and PC model . Then the PC became the standard for both publishing and laboratory equipment . <p> It was weird to make decisions in a snapshot of time where stuff did n't exist , was too slow or was constantly changing ( software ) and being overwelmed with technology . One decision I was FORCED to make was to design an interface to an existing monochometer and to build electric shutters and a filter wheel . There were no drivers for the stepper drivers and it probably would have been best if I wrote them . The stepper driver could be programmed with it 's own basic-like program , so it could handle the filters and even moving the wheel . <p> At the very end , a big empty box controls one shutter and " they " probably have no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based monochrometer , BUT our old one was better . It had a real-time interface that controlled start/stop and counts using a PDP-11 . So , the intent was to control the stepper directly with a programmable interface . I learned a lot . The software got unreadable on a Syquest drive , but it was n't complete anyway . <p> In terms of " process control " type stuff , it seems that the " research variety " is much harder to do . So , I never had training in the say PLC/Wonderware type of approach , but did stuff with the real-time approach . <p> To advance a synchonous motor was " cake " to do with the PDP-11 whereas the PC required counters and hardware to do it . e.g. move for x mS . <p> Research gizmos are really hard when management does n't know what 's required and the vendors are n't clear . One example is that it was unknown that you needed to purchase a separate programming package for the stepper controllers to program sequences in a basic like language . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RS422 signals compatible with the higher level RS232 signals . All of the stepper stuff I had was really useful information . <p> Your boss was an idiot for not listening to you with the Keithley adopted SMU bus . <p> I successfully used HP 's parallel bus card cage and some others with HPIB programming using HP9825 's in the 70 's for anything from a 1 day test program to measure all the phase frequency for Tiros N Tx UHF Tx 's on startup and 1 second burst to a 3 month project making a end-toend HP9825 calc with DMA , Rs422 1km link at a screaming 9600 baud with 96 ADC ports and 96 DAC options and 96 digital ports for 15A to 25A Relay box for I guess what now would be called Real Time SCADA for Black Brandt rocket launcher umbilicals . <p> Then later I got into designing DS1 BER test sets for worlds 1st ISDN Broadband WAN to the home and after company went titsup with a 1week design for Gandalf Muxing 1024 ports at 9600 baud , went on to HDD ST506 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years &lt;3 doing that and one supplier Syed Ifticar offered me his job &lt;mgr/owner&gt; at Syquest but my wife at the time did n't want to move from Winnipeg to Silicon Valley .

Also had offers at Seagate and Micropolis for similar high level , but same problem . <p> Then got into TE mgr role with 10 ATE 's , unit test , System test and about 30 mainframes scatter around production also 3 Clean rooms for servo writers , HDA testing ... all in Winnipeg at **36;350;TOOLONG lasted 10 years and got into Operations Mgr at wireless 2 way meter reading and a everything custom RF testing , later Iridium satphone 6GHz test design and once did the worlds first working Kopin LCD headset on VGA and ultrasound monitor signals .

NREL gave us calibration values for a few either filtered or unfiltered , non-AR coated Crystalline Silicon 1 sqcm cells that I think were made by Solarex that we used for calibration . Then we cross-calibrated like 10 more . Each daily calibration was with the last calibration cell you used and one new one . If the two did n't get the right values with a range , you had to find 3 that did or figure out what went wrong .

Will a outboard pass-transistor work like it does with a linear regulator ? I have found a suitable I2C boost regulator IC that operate in my desired voltage range the problem is it has a max I of 300mA but I need 20A . How could I do this . <p> The part number is LT3582 , the input voltage is 5v and the output voltage will be between 3.5v and 10 or 12v . What I was wanting to do was use a 12v 15A power supply and a zener to power the IC . I will read the data sheet further to see if it has an internal mosfet . <p> I suppose is does n't need to be I2C , I just want it to be controlled by a microcontroller and it must be accurate . That IC steps in increments of 25mV which is perfect . <p> This is a BOOST regulator so the output voltage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the output voltage to go down to 3.5 volts it 's input would need to be about 3.0 volts . this would mean that when the output was 12 volts at 20 amps the input current would be over 80 amps . ( This would be true with any boost regulator . ) You also say that you want to power the circuit from a 12 volt 15 amp power supply that is dropped down to 5 volts ( Or for it to work 3.0volts. ) using a zener diode . If we consider the 5.0 volts case and a maximum output of 12 volts at 20 amps then you need more than 12/5 x 20 amps = 48 amps . If the zener was in shunt mode it would need to be able to dissipate 5 x 48 = 240 watts and it 's series resistor would need to be able to dissipate 7 x 48 = 336 watts . If the zener was used in series with the 12 volt supply then it would need to dissipate 336 watts . I have never seen a zener with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create one using a smaller zener and power transistors . ) No matter what you do it is not possible to get 12 volts at 20 amps from a power supply of 12 volts at 15 amps . Using your boost regulator method you would need an input current of over 80 amps at 3 volts . I think this method is a non starter . <p> This is a BOOST regulator so the output voltage must be above the input voltage . If you need the output voltage to go down to 3.5 volts it 's input would need to be about 3.0 volts . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Sorry I meant 5.5V not 3.5 volts that was a typo , I also should have made it clear that I knew I would n't get 12v @ 20A from a 12V 15A . What I am trying to do is turn a 12v power supply into a 5-12v power supply that is mircocontroller controlled and has a single output . I was n't looking at how I could make the boost converter supply the current on its own but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra current . I do expect the max current to go down as voltage goes up . <p> If you already have 12V why do you need " and 10 or 12v " . What current ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> The reason I said 10v or 12v is because I was aware that I already had a 12v line but did n't want to have to unhook my wires from one terminal and connect to another to get 12v . I was thinking of going 5.5v-10v and using a relay to switch between 5.5v-10v from the IC and 12v supply voltage since at 12v I will already have 15A which is sufficiant at that voltage . I also want more current then the average regulator supplies . so was wondering if I could use an external transistor to increase the current my regulator i 'd supplying . I am going to look for an I2C buck converter to step my voltage down instead . <p> Looking at the datasheet for this IC it has the same problem as the I2C buck converters I have founf . It has a max voltage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have n't purchased a power supply yet so I could even find one with a higher voltage . I am doing the research before I purchase anything . <p> Edit : I do however have my old ATX bench top power supply that has a 5v rail and 12v rail I could just use that . <p> I think you have a good idea . Use a off line power supply to get away from the power line . Then use a safe voltage that will not kill you . <p> I would use a 24 to 48 volt power supply . Then buck down to 5 to 12 programmable . If you use 12 or 11V supply then you will need to " boost/buck " . Buck=5V and Boost=12V . This can be done but it takes more parts . <p> A year ago or about ; I was working on a government project . I used some of these . LONG ... Buck/boost . Programmable output voltage . ( I used a DAC to drive the Vset pin and another DAC to drive the Iset pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know there is one . Less money . <p> I was checking out their website , they have a lot of options for all sorts of applications . I am looking forward to building this . To power it should I just buy a 40V power supply or use a suitable transformer and diode bridge ? <p> I find I can get a 24V or 48V or something " brick " power supply for good prices . I like the Idea the input is 110/220 AC and the output is 40V regulated and current limited . A transformer + diodes is not current limited and not regulated .

Signal arrives at the first WS , splits into 2 WS , then splits into 4 WS , then finally splits into 8 WS which provides 16 outputs . I used 15 WS2811 chips with supporting o.1uf caps , and 100 ohm resistors . This allows one data in and 16 parallel output . PCB footprint : 1.6 " x 3.7 " , with estimated cost of parts at $6.90 plus $2 for pcb for total of $8.90 for a professional board ! 77964 @qwx697964 <p> This is a CMOS part with an input current of only 1 uA .

As for your buffer idea : I like that a lot for couple of reasons . For one the inputs are isolated in case of a short and secondly it compacts the design into a centralized point reducing pcb footprint . I most likely need to consider CMOS TTL buffers which can distinguish between low data and high levels at high speed . I wonder if ULN family will work ? <p> I looked at the old friend ULN and it is inverting logic and wo n't work . But looks like SN54AHCT541 buffer will do the trick . It is TTL compatible , has high speed of CMOS ( ns ) , 5v supply in a 20 pin package . I work on the pcb later today . <p> If you mean the ULN2003 or 2803 , those are high current open-collector relay/light bulb drivers , not data buffers . Pick you favorite device family ( TTL , LSTTL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for octal buffer or octal transparent latch . <p> Here is the board layout for this device . It consists of a WS2811 to condition the input signal , and two Octal Buffers to create isolation and to split the signal to 16 channels . The board is designed for 12V power supply system with an on-board voltage regulator to convert it to 5V to comform to TTL output . This device can be connected to 16 strings of smart pixels . For example : a large tree with 16 branches expanding radially outward 15 feet in all directions . Happy lighting ! <p> Can I just point out that the WS2811 is not an SPI device . It uses pulse proportional modulation as the encoding method . Just for anyone who reads this in the future . <p> Mike . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Valid point Pommie . With all due respect however , I would like you to google proportional modulation controllers ( to purchase a low cost Chinese controller that runs on WS2811 ) and see how many hits you get and how many of them you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong in the LED industry right now , there are two major players for cheap smart controllers . There is DMX and there is another protocol that WS2811 , 2812 , 2812B use , which goes by the name SPI . It is simply a distinguishing label to separate it from DMX type . We can go against the system by going around correcting all International manufacturers until everyone uses the same uniformity . Until another product comes out that calls its communication protocol an SPI again .

It has a camera and a receiver unit with fixed antennas . I have searched google and could n't find any . Please help . <p> try to attach a higher gain antenna on the receiver . They work noticably better than the miniscule factory supplied ones . I did that to a wireless camera and gained an extra 150 ' recpetion distance through steel and concrete structure . <p> I will not explain electronic theory . For those who know , no explanation is necessary . For those who do not , no explanation is possible ! <p> thanks hitech . Does anyone know any device that can retransmit a boosted signal between a sender and a receiver . See , the baby monitor 's receiver can be used with 3 camera 's that operates on frequencies 2.41 , 2.44 and 2.47 respectively . I 'm using only one @ 2.41 . Can I connect the boosting device @ 2.41 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.44 so that the boosting device will bridge the camera and receiver . <p> Though relativly speaking a common set of frequencies is used there are no frequency or bandwidth/spectrum standards for the 2.4ghz band so there is no ' standard ' RF relay you can just go out and pick up . The FCC only regulates out of band transmission and transmit power at 2.4ghz . The closest thing to a standard is Wi-fi , which are independant of the FCC . Thing is even wi-fi ' channels ' overlap . The whole 2.4ghz spectrum is effectivly uncontrolled . Your BEST bet for increased range is upgradeing your antenna , though this is techically illegal as it voids your devices FCC part 15 compliance if a non-HAM alters a commercial device . 77966 @qwx697966 <p> It may seem trivial ( and I do agree it 's trivial ) but many regulations are specific in that the equipment is approved as manufactured . That would make modifications illegal . The only danger that I could see to adding an antenna would be to unintentionally radiate RFI that might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example : I added a long wire antenna to an old AM table radio - and along with improved reception I could also adjust the dial so that the local oscillator would interfere with other radios nearby - to a greater degree than before . <p> I attended a local amateur radio meeting where several amateurs showed how they modified Wi-Fy equipment for greater range . What I remember them saying is that some Wi-Fy channels are in ham bands - some are not - and that the modified equipment must be operated by the licensed amateur within the ham bands . All of the requirements of that band apply - again , to the operation by a licensed amateur . I have to presume that they did some homework in examining the regulations . <p> Even modifying the receive antenna on a part15 devices is technically illegal , mind you only technically , I severely doubt the FCC will nocking your door down if you do it .. Personally as long as you are n't actually increasing transmit power puting high gain antennas on a wifi rig is safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uptight , the simple answer is these are the only airwaves we have , if the rules are tightly controlled and regulated they 're ruined for everyone . All it takes is one poorly built home transmitter to ruin the airwaves of potentially thousands of people in a large city . It 's also not exactly healthy to be submitting oneself to ever increasing concentrations RF energy just cause someone wants wireless access a few hundred feet further . 77966 @qwx697966 <p> I really do n't know the regulations when it comes to modifying WiFi gear , but I can see that increasing the gain of a receive antenna could result in increased radiation of the local oscillator . Coupling of local oscillator frequencies to a receive port is common .

Trouble is that everytime i get there in the morinings i have to either take it out of my wallet ( or off around my neck ) , roll down the window and place it in front of the HID reader in order for the gate to go up . <p> Now , is it possible for me to open up the prox card and , in some way , give it a boost so that i can have it either embedded inside my right external mirror housing that 's almost right up aginst the reader outside or have it mounted inside the car ? Or is the only way to extend the range is by the reader itself and nothing to do with the card at all ? <p> I found this on wikipedia of a card taken apart and was wondering if just providing some volts ( 3v ? ) to the coil would cause it to be picked up further away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this can work out it will be a nice project for me to do in my spare time . Not to mention saving me time with having to get my card , roll down the window , present card , roll up the window and put my card back around my neck or wallet . <p> There 's not too much you can do to increase range , other than to add a larger loop antenna . The RFID chip is powered by rectifying the rf signal transmitted by the reader , which induces a current in the card 's loop antenna . The induced current is proportional to the area of the loop and the number of turns of wire ( think of it as transformer coupling with one coil in the reader and the other coil in the card ) . So you can do better with a bigger card antenna , since you do n't care about being limited to credit card size . If you do this , use similar wire and similar number of turns in order to keep the impedance about the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place of the reader . Of course you 'll have to cut open your card in order to do this . JS <p> Those RFID devices are normally tuned quite accurately to the operating frequency which is transmitted by the reader . <p> Power and signal travel from the reader to the RFID device . The RFID device replies by partially shorting the coil . It is the reply signal that limits the range , and it is quite difficult to boost the reply signal . To reply the coil is partially shorted for a certain number of cycles of the operating frequency . While it would be possible to send out a large signal instead of shorting the coil , it would be very difficult to keep this synchronised with the operating frequency from the reader . <p> RFID ( not HID ) is what you are talking about here , and dispite all the good answers , what you want to do wo n't work , regardless of what you do to the card end . <p> The whole system is based around the **27;388;TOOLONG end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power applied to this coil , which you have no control over . <p> The tag is energized by the transmitter antenna ( coil ) and then read by the same antenna , either in a half duplex or full duplex system , so messing with the tag coil will have little effect , the systems are designed to work within a given proximity and only the power of the transmitter coil can change this operational distance . <p> Sorry to say you are flogging a dead horse , trying to adapt the card for a greater signal distance . <p> The whole system is based around the **27;417;TOOLONG end of the system and is all dependant on the coil size and power applied to this coil , which you have no control over . ... only the power of the transmitter coil can change this operational distance . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I do n't believe that is correct . While you have no control over the reader coil ( transmit/receive ) , you can control the output power of your personal transmitter to get a greater range . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuned circuit ) to send data , you drive your coil with the modulated carrier - this presents a much larger signal ( &amp; consequently increased range ) that is coupled to the receiver coil . <p> Your theory might work with half duplex but do n't  see how it can work with full duplex as almost all these cards are . <p> Pete . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I did some work on HITAG2 RFID tags . On that the reader transmitted by interrupting the 125 kHz field for a few cycles . The length of time between the gaps in the field was long or short for 1 or 0 . The tag transmitted by partially shorting its coil , in a Manchester encoded bit stream at a constant bit rate . <p> The signals received by the reader was tiny , and a lot of work had to go into spotting the tiny little changes in signal that were on top of the massive 125 kHz signal that was on the reader coil . The RFID tag would transmit shortly after a signal from the reader , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast enough after the massive upset of the 125 kHz field stopping , in time to see the tiny reply signal . <p> I ca n't see how you could possibly use a system like that in full duplex , because detecting the response relied on the field being really steady . <p> I know that there are other RFID systems , and maybe you can tell us how they can work in full duplex . <p> It is a good while ago now i had worked with RFID and its not as clear as it once was , But ... <p> Half duplex is the system you quoted and is often in the 125-138khz range , this is where a 125khz frequency is blasted out and energizes the tag coil/chip then the transmission is stopped and the tag sends back its code between 125-138 khz . Each time this process is repeated the tag will respond with its code . <p> Full duplex the carrier frequency is not switched off and the tag responds continuously and the data sent needs to be filtered out of the carrier frequency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail on these RFID systems i would surgest going to Texas Instruments web site and searching for RFID chips as they have excellent data sheets for their chips and other RFID products . <p> Here is a quote from a set of standards for animal tags using full duplex . <p> 6.1 Full duplex system <p> An FDX transponder receiving the activation field shall transmit its code during the activation period . The FDX transponder uses a modified DBP encoded subn++carrier , which is amplitude modulated upon the radio frequency carrier . Because the slope of a lown++high transition is not infinitely steep , every lown++high transition is advanced in time to a maximum of eight cycles to obtain optimal performance ( see figure 1 ) . The transponder shall send its message back using the frequency bands 129,0 kHz to 133,2 kHz and 135,2 kHz to 139,4 kHz . The duration of one bit is 32 activation field cycles . This corresponds to a bit rate of 4 194 bits/s . <p> NOTE n++ The basic frequency of the subn++carrier , containing the phase encoded data signal , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition and remains 4 194 Hz ( binary 1 : 180- phase shift ; binary 0 : no phase shift ) . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Most of what i done was with the 125khz range in half duplex as used in animal eartags . <p> Driving the coil is one thing , but do n't  forget the coil has 2 purposes and works as a receiver as well as a transmitter . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I have n't forgotten that there are 2 coils involved : the one in the reader ( tx &amp; rx ) and the one in the card . The reader coil has the carrier ( which may be &gt;100 volts ) ; its amplitude modulated by the presence of an external tuned circuit ( e.g. a card LC ) - the modulation may be &lt;0.1 volt ) . I ca n't imagine it would be hard to induce &lt;0.1 volt in a tuned circuit from a short distance away . <p> Your theory might work with half duplex but do n't  see how it can work with full duplex as almost all these cards are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not considered high security &amp; would generally use simplex ( not even half-duplex ) code spitters . I know for a fact that the one at my university was ( looked the same as the photo above ) &amp; also the one for the garage at my appartment complex ( I made a passive card ( using a PIC , coil and 2 caps ) after I lost my keys ) . Half-duplex is more expensive and not really needed for general garage security ( I can jump a fence easier than duplicating a simplex card , or I might invite a dodgy friend over - no type of card can protect against that so why pay for a more expensive system ? ) . <p> A mate and myself built a tag reader for cattle tags too , as they sell for $1000.00 here and as he had a small farm could not justify spending that sort of money . <p> We had good success , but it was a big learning curve , and accessing data on the protocol was not easy too . <p> Like yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a fully working prototype with reasonable reading range . <p> Our next stage was to construct a fixed reader so the animals could be scanned as they were run through a race , its still on the " To Do List " but to many other projects on the go at present . <p> And i thought we were about the only silly buggers that tackled this sort of select project , as could not find any help on designing a system for animal tags .

A high-capacity battery such as a car battery will cause all kinds of nasty problems to you , the wiring and the battery if you subject it to a short circuit as hundreds of amperes can flow under such conditions .

The result was that those bus bars at the bottom of the equipment bay were at around 200-300 volts with a capability of several thousands of amperes of current . That Crescent wrench VAPORIZED when it hit the buss , causing a flash that " sunburned " the technician . He was very lucky to have no worse an injury . After that incident , all techs were required to have all conductive tools with lanyards attached and around the tech 's neck when working around high-energy systems . <p> Thank you all for your replies , So when I short the terminals of a battery , the current that would flow is dependent on the internal resistance of the battery .

The result was a " chain " of little red dots around the back of the guy 's neck caused by this new-found , unintentional heating element . <p> This is also why when working on an automotive electrical system , you ALWAYS remove the ground cable from the battery first , then the positive cable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while removing the positive cable , no harm done . <p> Lithium Ion batteries also cause a pretty big problem if shorted .

However , this seems too easy does n't it ? <p> With our 3000 watt load the circuit current will be about 13.63 amps . The voltage drop across our 4 ohm resistor will be 4 * 13.63 = 55 volts . The voltage drop across our original load will be 12.1 * 13.63 = 165 volts . Our series resistor will need to easily dissipate 750 watts or so but figure 1000 watts minimum so it runs cool . You are looking at very expensive planar type heat sinked resistor in a 4 or 5 ohm flavor . Not very practical but it would work . <p> There is another problem . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements . It does not consider for example a heating element with any type of motor like a fan blower . Since our 12.1 ohm load now only has about 165 volts across it ( remember our 4 ohm resistor is dropping 55 volts ) that means any motors or fans designed for 220 VAC now only sees 165 volts . The motor may not like this lower working voltage and burn up . Additionally even if it did run it would run much slower than normal moving much less air and now we stand a very good chance of burning up our load . Of course all of that assumes heater elements but I am sure you get the idea . <p> The best approach would be to have a contactor supply the load and use the timer to drive the contactor . Contactor or SSR ( Solid State Relay ) would likely be a much more viable solution . <p> More info on the load as was mentioned would sure be helpful . <p> Ron 77976 @qwx697976 <p> thanks for the replies . the appliance is a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element is deep inside it and it would have to be opened up and the element replaced using new seals etc , its a new geyser so still under warranty so I do n't want to mess around with it . <p> it does n't  matter where the extra 500 Watts is being dissipated in the load only or load + a resistor , the total dissipation is still going to be more than what the timer switch can handle ( 3kW ) ! ! ! <p> Dave 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Hi Dave <p> The original post states in part : <p> I have a appliance that is rated at 4000 watts ( 220vac ) , I want to hook it up to a timer that is only rated at 3500 watts , so I would like to reduce the amount of wattage that this appliace can get . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> The switch in the timer is rated at 3500 watts . That was my take from the original post . <p> The load is a 4 KW load running on 220 VAC . That works out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely resistive load , like heating elements for example , that would be a load resistance of about 12 ohms . The load resistance and applied voltage are fixed so nothing can be done about it . <p> However , if I place a 4 ohm resistor in series with my load the total resistance increases from 12 ohms to 16 ohms . With the same 220 volts applied my circuit current drops from 18 amps to about 13.75 amps from the original 18 amps ( give or take ) . The overall power dissipated in the circuit drops from the original 4 KW to about 3 KW which is about 500 watts less than the switch is rated for . <p> The big problem doing this , as I mentioned , is the 4 ohm resistor will be looking to dissipate over 700 watts of power ( quite toasty ) so you would need a heck of a large resistor well heat sinked . I also listed some other consequences of simply placing a resistor in series with the load . Anyway , we still do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of a contactor or SSR as what I saw as a more viable solution . <p> Ron 77976 @qwx697976 <p> You could run the heater from a lower voltage . It would heat up much more slowly if running from 120 V but it would work fine , and not overload the timer . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Running a heater designed for 240V on 120V means that it will take four times longer to heat a given volume of water . If the heated water is being used ( as in a residential water heater ) , then it could n't keep up unless the flow is very small . Not a good idea . Just get a timer and a relay . 77970 @qwx697970 <p> A choke coil will work if it is AC but if the appliance has an electric motor surge current is typically = to locked rotor current which is several times more than full load current so the motor will never start . The motor will try to start over heat and burn up . <p> I need to warn everyone , that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voltage in your country . 240 VAC is common in the US . Way back when it seemed to be 120/220 , now it 's 120/240 . If you had a heater rated at 220 and were using it on 240 , there will be other issues . Timer and a contactor is the way to go . I got a 7 day programmable DIN rail timer for about $15 on ebay . They have them with 110 and 220 inputs , so you would need a contactor with a 220/240 V coil .

@@71811653 @511653/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Understanding FM transmitter circuit <p> I 'm trying to understand how the following FM transmitter circuit works . I got it from the site Wireless FM Transmitter . The site has some explanation on how the circuit works , however I 'm not sure about a few things , including the electret mic &amp; how the frequency modulation takes place . <p> The electret microphone has a current of 200uA which changes by +- 3 uA depending on sound waves . This sets the voltage across R1 to 2V and the voltage across the mic to 4 volts . As the sound hits the mic the current through R1 increases slightly reducing the voltage across the mic . Is that what is happening ? <p> This changing voltage is passed on by the coupling cap , C1 to the base of the transistor , which is biased by R2 &amp; R3 to approx 2V . The voltage across R4 with no signal on the mic will be Vb - 0.7 ( drop across vbe ) , 1.3 volts . As the voltage at b changes R4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage is seen at the base of the tank circuit . And the signals voltage is increased/decreased . Is n't this what happens in AM ? As would n't the capacitance need to change in order to get Frequency modulation ? And if it was amplitude modulation occuring in the FM spectrum , then how would a radio receiver be able to demodulate the signal ? <p> At this point I 'm not sure what is happening at the capacitor C3 , what is that doing ? Is it holding CE at a fixed voltage ? And is it along with capacitor C2 considered a bypass capacitor ? Or do bypass capacitors need to be connected to ground ? <p> You almost figured it all out . You were right in your assumption about the mic . The Frequency is modulated by the tank circuit on the collector of Q1 . It estaplishes the carier frequency and the mic modifies the freqency a little based on the audible frequency that the mic picks up . C3 is just a bypass capacitor . Since Q1 is configured as a collecter amplifier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry it a greater distance . <p> This is not the best FM transmiter that you could hope to make , however it is a really simple transmiter that will work fine for your personal use . The best way to understand what is happening is to make the circuit yourself and gain an understanding through experience . Just do n't try to make it on a bread board , this is a common mistake ( one that I myself am guilty of ) . The wires on the breadboard will act as antenas and pick up stray RF , in additon to the capacitance between each strip messing with the calibration of the circuit . <p> I think that I have explained it fairly simply , if anyone else wants to add ( or correct ) anything that I 've said feel free . ( AG may be able to give a much more detailed explination ) <p> Microphone output voltage coupled to the base of Q1 affects the junction capacitance and thus frequency modulation . C3 is used to maintain the oscillations generated in the tank circuit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AM transmitter . This outputs both AM and FM , but the limiter stage of an FM receiver clips the upper portions of the IF signal -so only frequency deviations comes to the detector stage . In case of a PLL synthesizer , it is sensitive to only FM . <p> As the voltage at b changes R4 will change by the same amount . This change in voltage is seen at the base of the tank circuit . And the signals voltage is increased/decreased . Is n't this what happens in AM ? As would n't the capacitance need to change in order to get Frequency modulation ? And if it was amplitude modulation occuring in the FM spectrum , then how would a radio receiver be able to demodulate the signal ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> It does produce AM . <p> FM is also produced because the transistor 's junction capacitance varies with the voltage . <p> As mentioned above , it 's a pretty poor quality transmitter . 77972 @qwx697972 77975 @qwx697975 <p> Jeeperz ... you folks are HOT when it comes to helping people out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application . <p> Really glad I joined this Forum . <p> Fun and games are over .

@@71811654 @511654/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> Hi Eric , thanks for the reply . Newbie alert , please expand on " differentiated pulse " please ! ! Does this mean they introduce some external dead time reducing the chance of both FETs ever being on together ? I am finding the signal level with the 1000pF caps is very low at the driver chip , only JUST enough to drive it reliably . For example , if you just touch pins 10 or 12 on the IR2110 when running the waveform to the gates goes berserk and stays that way . I found out by accident , then looked at the levels . Before C1 and C2 the levels are fine . Thanks again . <p> OK , thanks a lot for taking the time and trouble to simulate this , I just had a look on my scope at the inputs to the driver and there 's a good similarity in the traces , I am impressed ! <p> But in my naivety I have to ask just what do you believe the designer 's intention was with these ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the push pull output FETs , or what ?

Then the C1,2 values may need to be reduced . <p> Also pin 11 is high impedance and touching 12 or 10 with 11 shuts down the chip making the signals haywire , soa pull down R of 10K improves immunity on pin 11 ( SD ) ; ( &gt;100k to gnd internal ) <p> But if you are using 74HC74 then you should be getting 5V positive pulse with the negative pulses clamped by internal ESD diodes . <p> So this design has some minor flaws or sensitivities . <p> The intent is to drive the FF with 2x frequency then divide by two using Qbar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each complementary output is differentiated so the rising output edge is the only active time each driver outputs are ON thus controlled by the RC decay time and thus the dead time , between one input going below Vih threhold to Vil and the other input fast rising edge . <p> Dead time 0.5 us or so is typical and depends on power driver RdsOn and hence Coss. turn off delay . <p> 1000pF and 15k yields a 15us time constant but since the threshold is near Vcc/2 it switches much earlier than this time constant for low pulse heights . This is not a precise method of deadtime control but I suppose can be made to work . <p> It is a classic problem with push-pull transistors to make sure that both transistors do not conduct at the same time- bad for the transistors , bad for the transformer , bad for power efficiency , and bad for output waveform purity . <p> The upper two NMOSFETs operate in parallel as do the two lower NMOSFET pair , so each parallel pair can be considered to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as you suspect , the diode in parallel with the 10 Ohm resistor turns the NMOSFETS on relatively slowly and off fast . <p> But , in order to understand how this works , you need to know one vital bit of information about MOSFETs : they have a very high gate/drain capacitance . <p> In order to charge and discharge the gate capacitance fast , a gate driver chips are used , as is the case in your circuit , Gate drivers have a high source and sink current capability , typically 1.5A . <p> Now to the core point ; the the gate capacitance is charged up via the 10 ohm resistor ( turn on ) and is discharged via the 10 Ohm resistor in parallel with the forward biased diode , which could have a forward effective resistance of 0.5 Ohm . <p> So after all that , the you can see that the turn on gate time constant is 10 ohms * CGD ( capacitance , gate/drain ) and , roughly speaking , the turn off gate time constant is 0.5 ohms * CGD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole story about gate driving , but I hope it answers your question . <p> Some great info , thanks . spec , I was asking about C1 and C2 , but thanks for the info re gate capacitance .

I am also aware that with paralleled devices the driver has to work twice as hard , I believe ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Oops ! so you were . <p> Yes , that is true about the gate driver having to work twice as hard with two parallel MOSFETs , but if you substituted a single MOSFET with twice the power capability , the gate capacitance would be liable to be twice as much so the amount of work the gate driver had to do would be around the same . <p> The resistors and capacitors form differentiators with a time constant of R * C. <p> The time constant is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differentiation will not take place at the signal half periods , so the R and C combination will neither speed up or slow down the signal . They will simply make the mean level of the signal feeding the MOSFET driver zero volts ( DC blocking ) . <p> But what the R/C combination does do is to switch off both MOSFET pairs , after a delay proportional to the time constant , if the clock input to the 74F74 is absent for any reason . This will protect the MOSFETs , transformer , and possibly other components , from excess current . <p> Why should one of the MOSFET pairs be permanently on if the signal were missing . The 74F74 has only two states and in one of those states , either Q or /Q output will be at a high level so , if the outputs of the 74F74 were directly coupled to the MOSFET driver inputs , one of the MOSFETs would be permanently on . <p> Why should a permanently on MOSFET damage itself and/or the transformer . A transformer has a primary inductance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inductors that the amount of current flowing through them is dependent on the voltage across the inductor and the time that the voltage has been applied . <p> For example , if you had a perfect one Henry inductor and applied one volt across it from a perfect voltage source , the current through the inductor would increase linearly from zero amps at the rate of one amp per second without limit . So after an hour , for example , the current would be 3,600A . <p> But there is a further problem with practical inductors ( transformers ) , after a certain current in the primary the core will saturate and you will no longer have an inductor but a piece of wire with a relatively low resistance . So , when the core saturates , the current shoots up and inevitably destroys some component , normally the transformer and/or the MOSFETs . <p> hi Chris , If the frequency source waveform is not ' clean and sharp ' , the 7474 output could ' chatter ' high/low on the slowly rising input clocking source .

I think switch but I do n't know exact reason when does we use switch or hub in network ? <p> Because the phone system and internet networks are about the same and they grew up the same way , I have a story . <p> When I was young ; it costs too much money to run phone wire(s) in the rural farm country . There are wires all over town . In the country about 10 houses are connected together on one wire . To call your neighbor you pick up the phone and listen . If some one is talking then you should hang up and wait . If you hear a dial tone then you can dial . These little " party lines " were built on a two digit system . " 15 " is for house 5 , " 25 " is for house 15. " 0 " is for the operator . When you dial , a small mechanical computer listened for the numbers . Then the computer would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones phones rang . There was different types of rings , one for each house . ( long ring+short ring ) =house 1 , ( short ring+long ring ) =house 2 , ( long + long ) =house 3 , etc If you dialed 99 then there was an emergency ( fire ) , the ring was very long with no breaks , every one picked up . If you dialed 0 then your " network " connected to town . <p> To talk long distance ; Dial 0 , connect to town , tell the operator the name of the town , then you are talking to the operator in that town . Each town had a wire to all the close towns . ( no very long wires ) If you wanted to talk to a town 100 miles away you would have to talk to the operators in each town from here to there . You could really only go about 5 towns away because the signal got too week . <p> Some small house networks are much like the party line . The wire has all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am computer 1 and this data is for computer 2 ... data ... end " ) Computer 5 will see this but not respond . **28;446;TOOLONG In town we had a 4 digit system . 4xxxx connected you to house xxxx. 1 connected you to an long distance operator , 0 connected you to a local operator ( in town ) . 9 connected you to an emergency operator . There was a switch board like the one in post #2. ( run by a mechanical computer ) If phone 105 called phone 206 then those two wires are connected together . At the same time phone 300 could call phone 045 and those wires are connected together . 100 people could talk at the same time . There are no sharing of wires . <p> Some computer networks are like this . Where several computer can talk at the same time . **27;476;TOOLONG In all cases each small network is like a family . Then there is a connection to the next network , next network , next network all the way around the world . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one connection to the internet . In town there probably is a network that has a dish pointing at the sky and 10 fiber connections to other networks . ( no computers ) <p> Hub is like a " party line " in post #5 . All computers see all the data . If is good for home networks and small business . Switch is where the data is looked at by the switch and sent only to the right computer . Is good where there is large amounts of data . Router is used to connect your network to another network . ( your house to your provider ) A router often includes a hub or switch so you have a place to connect several computers . <p> I have doubt suppose I have three computers A , B and C and I have one printer . I just want to share printer for three computers and also want share file together . what should I have to use hub or switch ? I think switch but I do n't know exact reason when does we use switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and routers are all devices that let you connect one or more computers to other computers , networked devices , or even other networks . Each has two or more connectors called ports into which you plug in the cables to make the connection . Varying degrees of magic happen inside the device and therein lies the difference . I often see the terms misused , so let 's clarify what each one really means . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> We can Network as few as two computers using a simple crossover cable . When we have three , four or even five computers we can form a network using a router ( intelligence ) as a peer to peer group of computers . When we begin to exceed five computers and depending on the needs we can allow a server where each computer works through the server . Really a matter of our specific needs . My wife and I share two printers and a scanner but also each of our tablets and smart phones can print across and use our home network . So when forming a network you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible future needs and build the network around needs . The above posted link does a good job of breaking down switches , hubs and routers with the latter being more intelligent . <p> Ron 77976 @qwx697976 <p> Vead , Because you have a small network , you can use a old ( used ) switch . There is no reason to spend big money . There are many people that must have the best equipment , and they send last year 's equipment to the trash . I would look for a wireless switch . Even if you do n't have a need for wireless . My phone uses wireless and it is set to use the house network when it can to reduce the data over the phone network .

I always like to do some real work . I am planing to purchase switch , hub . I have downloaded some books . do you have some idea which links or books are best for learning networking <p> Switches on the othe rhand if you had 3 computers , A , B and C and one printer if A was printing B and C would not see that traffic . <p> Businesses will use a managed switch . They are classified as L1 , L2 and L3 or Layer 1 , 2 and 3 . The Levels , basically define what they can do . <p> as the Internet matured , the role of the router , switch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can perform router functions and VLAN 's or Virtual LANS were created . <p> So , an IP phone would have a separate VLAN associated with that network . Traffic destined for a printer wouldn ; t collide with voice traffic at all . <p> There is something called multicasting and unicasting . If you were " televising " ( delivering a live performace via the Internet ) , it makes sense to have one source and many destinations . Unicasting , sets up a link between two devices , <p> So , there is a lot of stuff going on , <p> A simple bridge would be when traffic say travels via fiber . <p> In a home with a DSL modem , router , switch and Wireless . They can all be combined together , The wireless in generally used in Bridge mode , but Access point devices have a few different modes taht it can use . Bridge or Access Point mode . They can even set up ethernet to wireless to ethernet bridge . e.g. A printer could pass traffic via **26;505;TOOLONG to the printer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets you out of subnet . Home routers use NAT to make all of your computers effectively routeable to the Internet if you allow . The public I address has services or PORTS associated with it . HTTP is port 80 . If a request came in for port 80 of the public IP address , the router says , that goes to my http server on addresss 10.0.1.200 . <p> DSL in bridge mode is quite unique , When traffic leaves the WAN port of the router , it travels via a DSL bridge to the DSLAM ( A DSL telco thing ) . From there is travels using an ATM protocol ( a telco thing ) and eventually to a router via ethernet . So , when you ping the IP address of your public IP from inside your netowork , the packet travels through the telco lines and ATM until the router at the end point responds . For me that router is located about 40 miles from me . <p> A ping packet sent from outside the network , would n't even see the telephone line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of stuff going on , <p> What makes a lot of this possible is that every interface gets a unique MAC address . Unique makes it easier . The only thing that matters is that the MAC address is unique in the routeable segment . Thus you can CLONE MAC addresses of cable modems . With cable , everyone is on the same wire , so the cable company uses the MAC address to know it 's you . If you change your cable modem , you either have to have the cable company re-authenticate you or just make the MAC address the same as your old cable modem . <p> DSL does n't need that , since it 's a different physical wire . <p> You create routeable segments with an IP address . some are public ( visible to the Internet ) and some are private ( non-routeable to the Internet , just the local LAN ) . <p> Mr. Ron Thank you very much for your explanation , your efforts .

Assuming it 's going to be used in an office , home or school then it 's pollution category II , most most PCB materials are material group IIIa or IIIb and from table IV the creepage distances for 120V and 230V are 1.5mm and 2.5mm respectively . <p> Note that the above distances are for basic or supplementary insulation , the DC side needs to be double insulated from the mains so the distances need to be doubled . <p> Basically , if the mains voltage is 120V you should leave a minimum distance of 3mm between the mains and DC side and if the mains is 230V the minimum distance should be 5mm . Note that this only applies for indoor domestic and office appliances , not equipment designed to be used outdoors or in a factory . 77972 @qwx697972 77975 @qwx697975 <p> Here 's a site with a calculator for working out the creepage and clearances . <p> I tried running the calculation for 250V mains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result was 5mm which is to be **25;533;TOOLONG Welcome ! <p> I know there 's no scale or indication of which tracks are which but some of the tracks near the opt-isolators look pretty close .

There is not much i can do about it The only solution that might be possible be to create my own pads for traics . <p> You need to understand that , for safety purposes , there are four different class of electrical insulation : <p> Functional insulation Only required for correct operation of the device and not protection against electric shock . <p> If the functional insulation fails , the device will stop working , a fuse may blow but there should be no possibility of the user receiving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for protection against electric shock , they are as follows : <p> Basic insulation - stronger than functional insulation and required between earthed metal parts and the mains . <p> Supplementary insulation -an additional layer of insulation as a backup in case the basic insulation fails . <p> Reinforced insulation - a very strong layer of insulation designed never to fail . <p> Double insulation Can be either : A layer of basic insulation and reinforced insulation . <p> Or : a single layer of reinforced insulation <p> The insulation between the TRIAC 's gate and three terminals is classed as functional insulation only and is not protecting the user from electrical shock . The spacing for functional insulation does n't need to be as large as reinforced or basic insulation which are safety critical . <p> The 5mm rule only applies to 5V traces and pins running near 230VAC traces and pins . <p> I 've just realised another thing : is the 5V derived from a transformerless power supply ? <p> If so it should be treated with the same respect as mains and the 5mm rule does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for safety purposes . <p> I do n't have a very good feeling about this , it could be very dangerous . 77972 @qwx697972 77975 @qwx697975 <p> The power is being driven from same source , one coming directly ( 220V ) and one coming from transformer and then being regulated to 5V using 7805 . Well i guess the only way would be to test it by making PCB . <p> I 've read conflicting pieces of information in the article . The calculator seems to spit out much lower figures when set to a coated board but an article I read states that it should n't make any difference . My opinion is that a solder resist should improve it a little bit but I 'd still try to leave 5mm between mains and DC where ever possible . <p> To be honest , I ca n't tell you whether your PCB is safe or not and wo n't be able to figure it out unless you tell me which tracks are mains and which aren't. 77972 @qwx697972 77975 @qwx697975 <p> Oh sorry , well the thick traces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sign is hot line ( phase ) and next to it is Neutral ( N ) . Both the thick tracks written next to 1 and 2 are the outputs of 220 going to Fan . The + sign means DC 5V and - means DC Ground . <p> The 220V when goes to the bridge ( circular component ) drops voltage very close to 1V ( i do not know why ) but gives correct Zero crossing values to the two PIC12 Controllers right below the 07 header . These PIC 's according to the latched data from 07 header Dim the fan speeds by phase control using triacs and MOC3020 's . <p> The big IC is just a flipflop which takes input from one header and latches it to 07 header . I hope its a little more clearer now . <p> Why are you using a flip-flop in the same circuit as a microcontroller ? Surely the flip-flop can be removed and replaced with a software solution which does n't take any PCB space . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Well these microcontrollers are only here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from another microcontroller which uses BUS architecture . The data from BUS is latched on using the flip flop on this board . I do not think there is any other 4-bit input way other than using serial communication which is a little more complex . The small PIC12 has only 6 I/O pins and 4 are for dimming level ( 0-100 with a step of 10 ) , 1 for ZC and one is for output pulse which fires the triac . <p> I would rotate the optoisolators and the graetz bridge so the power line does not pass close to the isolated circuit . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Yes , I 'd agree , that should also save space . <p> Best practise is to allocate one section of the PCB for mains and keep everything else at least 5mm away from it . The only things that are allowed to bridge the 5mm no go zone are opto-isolators , Y1 rated capacitors and high voltage resistor and their pads should be at least 5mm either side of the 5mm no go zone . <p> You 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double sided PCB , many connections can be routed via the component side . <p> Earilier on you talked about using SMT resistors , all I say is be careful with with volage ratings , the 47k resistors need to be able to handel the peak mains votlage and good luck finding SMT resistors that 'll do that . <p> You 're lucky this is n't rectified mains ( i.e. 325V DC ) which requires 7mm clearance because it 's the RMS voltage that counts for creepage , not the peak voltage . 77972 @qwx697972 77975 @qwx697975 
@@71811662 @511662/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> If you filter the output of a half-wave or full-wave rectifier you end up with a DC voltage which is near the peak voltage of the sine wave so you you will have Vdc about 1.4 times the RMS value .

The problem is , the meters . If you look at it in terms of power delivered to a resistive load V*I and Vrms * I will be the same . <p> DC meters are easy . AC fluctuations are averaged out . They may use a technique called dual-slope conversion . <p> AC meters are a mess . Most reject the DC component , but some can be persuaded to measure Vdc+Vac or Vac . Most are average responding , RMS reading and assume a sine wave of less than some frequency . <p> True RMS reading meters may be dependent on something called the " crest factor " and the frequency .

The main reason for this is that the complete circuit is rarely specified and the authors sometimes cross over from one kind of filter circuit to another assuming that the readers will understand what they meant from the context , or else they just make the mistake of assuming that all the rectifier filter circuits produce the same output , which they definitely do not . I attempt to outline what the differences are here . <p> The main source of the confusion lies in the filter section itself . In order to specify what to expect on the output we have to classify the filter circuit being used as well as the conditions that it is being used under . I know that sounds little more complicated than you probably wanted to hear , but that 's the way some circuits are . <p> There are at least three types of filters used on the output of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capacitor filter 3 . Inductor and capacitor filter ( often referred to as a " choke input filter " ) <p> How about if we take a quick look at each one ? <p> For the full wave rectifier with no output filter , the output is a sine wave that has it 's negative half cycles flipped so they are positive too . The average DC voltage is calculated by integrating over time ( summing small contributions over one cycle ) and the value comes out to : Vavg=2*Vpeak/pi where Vpeak is the peak value of the original siine wave . <p> Note here that Vavg is the average voltage , also called the average DC voltage or the average DC value . This is not really a DC voltage , it 's just a number we would get if we had taken the average of the full wave signal over time . This value is lower than the peak because the wave fluctuates between the peak and zero . <p> Now we look at the simple capacitor filter . <p> The cap filter takes the input and filters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy so that some energy is still available between the peaks of the sine , unlike the rectifier with no filter which does not do this . This means it can supply energy for more of the total cycle time so the average output goes up . What it actually goes up to depends largely on the value of the cap and the value of the load current . It 's not the simplest thing to calculate because the cap keeps the lower part of the output above some level while the upper part still approaches the peak value . An approximation would be some DC level with a triangle wave riding on top . The average of the triangle plus the DC level would give us the new average DC level , and it would be higher than with no filter at all . Since the loading affects the valley part of the wave , more load would mean a lower triangle dip and so the average would come out lower too . Less load is just the opposite . The overall result is that with a cap filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on it and how much capacitance we use . This is unlike the non filtered full wave which does not change with load but stays at the set value of 2*Vpeak/pi . <p> Now let 's look at the choke input filter . <p> The inductor and capacitor filter ( choke input filter ) is entirely different . This is where the expression , " The output DC of the full wave rectifier is the same with or without a filter . " comes from . That expression is n't entirely true , but it is true within a certain range of loads when it is designed right . The average DC output of the filter is approximately equal to 2*Vpeak/pi just like the full wave rectifier without a filter , except of course with an LC filter ( LC means inductor and capacitor ) we get a much smoother output DC level . There is a limit to this too though , because if we load the filter too much we wont see this relationship anymore , but it does hold approximately over a wide range of loads so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep in mind however that it wont always hold with extreme values of load ( too light or too heavy ) . <p> Summary : <p> 1 . The average DC output of a full wave rectifier with no filter is 2*Vpeak/pi and does not change ( much ) with load . 2 . The average DC output of a full wave rectifier with only capacitor filtering varies with load and value of the capacitor. 3 . The average DC output of a full wave rectifier with a choke input filter ( inductor plus capacitor ) varies with load and value of inductor and capacitor , but remains approximately equal to the same as with no filter ( 2*Vpeak/pi ) within a certain relatively wide range of load values . The DC output does vary , but not as dramatically as with a capacitor only filter . <p> Last edited : May 8 , 2011 77974 @qwx697974 
@@71811664 @511664/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> i could only change drill and it works for pads and vias , but not component pads . thus i used to mod few important components and save with some modded name use them , like 0.25watt resistor. at this time i would increase the pad dia and drill dia <p> A hole is a mounting hole ( normally located at four corners of the PCB ) . It 's diameter ( hole size ) can be changed at any time . <p> Component drill sizes depend on the manufacturer 's datasheets and they are dimensioned richly in Eagle , e.g. a DIP-package has pins of 0.6096mm while Eagle sets a drill size of 0.8192mm - which is large enough to put in the IC pin and throw a parcel through the remainder of the drill . <p> When drilling your PCBs a minimum of drill bits is required . Provided your drill motor runs fairly balanced ( no lateral play greater than 0.01mm ) you can use drill bits of 0.6mm . For ICs ( DIP package ) use 0.8mm . ( Using machined IC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The same drill size can be used for 250mW resistors and low capacitance electrolytic caps . <p> As explained above , you can not change the drill size for components globally . That is , without changing each component in the library . You have not said whether this is for commercial manufacturing or DIY . <p> If it is the latter , there is a work around that might help . There is a ULP called " drill-aid " . That affects layer 116 only . You can set whatever diameter you want in that layer and it affects all holes . If 0.6 mm is the same size or smaller than all the holes on your board , they will then appear to be all the same size . The UPL includes instructions for reversing the process , if that is not what you want . <p> 1 ) I use it to help center the drills , so I use a fairly small setting like 0.3 mm. 2 ) If your board is being manufactured , I am not sure whether the manufacturer will even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components slide into drill holes easily , especially when using a professionally manufactured PCB with plated through holes . The copper layer within through holes is very thin ( 10 - 17-m ) which will be damaged when pressing a part wire through it , thus removing the copper resulting in a missing connection . 
@@71811666 @511666/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> Hi may i know what 's the difference between using a RC and LC filters besides difference in components ? Thanks a lot . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> An LC filter has a steeper slope , because it has two ' active ' components rather than just one . Generally you would use RC in an opamp filter , because it 's far easier ( and cheaper ) to obtain resistors than high value inductors , and the opamp makes up for not using inductors . For a passive filter ( crossovers etc. ) you would usually use LC for the much greater performance . <p> LC circuits will resonate at a specific frequency . RLC circuits will resonate over a wider range of frequencies . RC circuits are small and cheap . RL circuits are large and expensive . I do n't recall ever encountering one in the field except as a side effect of a transformer. 
@@71811667 @511667/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> Hi Joe , Eh mate the easiest way would be put in a T-piece and mount the temp sensor off the branch , it wo n't be hard to seal it as 4 bar is n't really that high a pressure . The way I would do it is solder a 1/4 " bsp nipple into the branch then seal a LM335 or ds1920 into the fitting . There are plenty of compression fittings on the market and that would make for a dead easy seal . <p> Hope this Helps Bryan <p> " NEVER argue with stupid people , they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience " - Mark Twain <p> Unless the fluid , pipe and surrounding air are all at the same temperature there will always be some kind of temperature gradient . If the fluid is hot , relative to surroundings the very center will likely be hottest , the fluid touching the pipe wall will be coolest , the outside of the pipe wall will be cooler than that - and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some hot water and it flowed thru cold pipes the water would be cooled and the pipe heated . If you were to look at a cross section you 'd see the differences . <p> A reasonable question might be to ask where in this cross section is of greatest interest - the center , the outside , etc ? Do n't forget that the fluid might be cooling as it travels down the pipe , especially if the initial temp just went up and the pipe has n't warmed all the way along it 's length . <p> The whole point of this is to illustrate why measuring the pipe wall temp might be sufficient . Now and then very low thermal mass sensors are placed in fluid streams but it 's more common to have a T fitting and a well - more or less a protrusion into the fluid stream with a hole in it where the sensor resides . <p> If your sensor is small enough you might fabricate your own well . Thin wall copper or brass tubing could be inserted thru the pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed into it with some thermal grease . That might give you somewhat faster response but also the separation you desire from the fluid stream . <p> If the pipe has a rather thick wall ( castings of some faucets do ) you might fashion a well from threaded brass rod ( small dia ) . You 'd drill/tap the thick wall . You 'd drill out a pocket in the brass rod for a sensor . <p> Perhaps we should back up a bit . Do you really truly have to have a 1 sec response time ? As you note , putting an immersion probe through a round pipe wall is not the best situation . So , are you sure you do n't have a block somewhere from whatever part of this heats/cools the water that you could tap threads and screw into ? You want to be really close to the source of the water 's temp change . <p> There might be some computer alogrithms which may help . For example , if you have 60F water and suddenly switch to 70F water it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 68F and longer to get to 70F . But , if you 're reading 60.0F and then see the temp go to 61.0F in the next second , the high rate of change can be used to calculate the actual temp . Like a PID controller . You would need to characterize the properties of the pipe and the thermistor itself . <p> As others have said , getting the sensor in the pipe without leaks is really not as big a problem as you might think . a little bit of decent epoxy ( I would suggest JB weld ) should be far more than enough to prevent leaks , and if you are really that worried about it , when you install it in the fitting or whatever , seal around the inside as well with some silicone or something . <p> If response time is not extremely critical the copper tube is not a problem here . Just attach the sensor to the outside of the well-cleaned tube with some thermal grease on it and some isolation material around it all and it will work fine .

I tested a half-dozen with my Tektronics curve tracer , and they all seem to have a Zener-like reverse breakdown at -15V +-1V ( very sharp knee , wonder if you could use them as a Zener ? ) . <p> Since I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving them into the region where they conduct in the reverse direction does n't seem to damage them . The instantaneous power dissipation at -15V at -20mA is 300mW , which seems within the ability of the package to dissipate . <p> Last edited : Oct 10 , 2012 77970 @qwx697970 <p> Quality commercial products ( especially in the old days ) put a cap in parallel with the LED , right on the LED . I still do this now on power LEDs . The combination of series resistor and parallel cap gives excellent LED life . <p> I 've replaced a huge number of dead LEDs in appliances over the years , and they were always LEDs without caps . I ca n't remember ever replacing a LED that did have a parallel cap . As far as putting diodes in series or reverse parallel that sounds a bit gimicky and I have not seen that done much in any commercial products . <p> ...

Turning on , not so much . I 'm still favoring the inverse parallel Silicon diode connection . The diode capacitance helps protect the LED , the diode turn-on is what protects the LED , and the turn-off time of the diode does n't matter . Looking for a definitive reference . <p> Last edited : Oct 11 , 2012 77970 @qwx697970 <p> Fast recovery has to do with the ability to handle a second surge .

If anything , the slower the diode recovery is , the better , because it will still be conducting ( will not have " recovered " ) when the second and subsequent transients come along ... 77970 @qwx697970

@@71811675 @511675/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> C18 : Error - could not find definition of symbol .. <p> After several years of successfully writing moderately complex embedded programs for PIC16C series using a combination of MPLAB / Hitech C I now need to use the PIC18F452 for a project . As Hitech C does n't support the ' 18 ' parts I have been trying to get C18/MPLAB up and running . <p> MPLAB C18 version : 3.42 . MPLAB : V8.00 <p> The c program is LEDS.C from within the C18 directory . <p> The project has been defined for the PIC18F452 , which is also manually selected in configure/select device . <p> In the project wizard I selected the MPLAB C18 toolsuite : I added the file LEDS.C to the source part of the project , and I have added the linker file P18F452g.lkr to the Linker part of the project . I assume that 's correct so far ? <p> When I attempt to build this project the following error occurs : <p> Error - could not find definition of symbol ' OpenTimer0 ' in file ' C : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following lines : <p> #include &lt;p18cxxx.h&gt; #include &lt;timers.h&gt; <p> ' p18cxxx.h ' references the specific definitions file ' P18f452.h ' <p> The function ' OpenTimer0 ' -is- defined in the ' timers.h.

Is n't that what a Wizard is for ? <p> Following one suggestion , I tried adding ' p18f452.lib ' to the ' libs ' section of the project . This simply led to it being unable to find a different definition ( ' STATUS ' ) . I 've removed ' p18f452.lib from the project again , so the situation is as outlined above . <p> Looking around the net I see variations on this question repeated over and over again , always seemingly with a different answer . It suggests that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please post the code ( or a link to the code on , say , www.pastebin.com ) ? Generally I 've noticed that function names do n't start with a capital . OpenTimer0 , for example , is probably actually openTimer0 . I really need to see your code . I do n't think I can help you much without it . 77967 @qwx697967 <p> P.S.

@@71811676 @511676/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Eagle or Proteus ? <p> I have been doing a fair bit of PCB design work of late , and I always used to use Proteus for schematic drawing , sometimes simulating and PCB design . <p> I had a requirement to allow other users to see the schematic in raw format and Gerber format , so I naturally suggested GCPrevue under Windows , but then I had an issue with the raw format , as Proteus is of course an expensive licensed application , so I started using Eagle 6 , had a panic about a CADCAM error then 6.1 came out and all was fluffy again , and I really liked Eagle , was n't as " easy " to use as Proteus but once you get back in to the basics and I read the tutorial and watched some videos it was fairly straight forward , I have n't attempted to create a part yet . <p> What really surprised me was the amount of footprints available for Eagle , Proteus has a good selection but Eagle , WOW ! <p> So my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Had you the choice which package would you favour between Proteus or Eagle and why ? The first obvious thing going for Eagle is there is a free version ! I did try Easy-PC but went back to Eagle . <p> Secondly if you know of any other PCB design package that is free ( albeit limited such as Eagle 6 in pins and components and board sizes etc ) , or not too expensive ( for trialling ) , but has such as vast and extensive library / community ( for parts / footprints ) as Eagle I would like to hear what your suggestions / thoughts are ! <p> Proteus is an all in one product from schematics to board layout through to simulation on a high level . Eagle is schematics and board layout design software only , no practical simulation . They 're very different products . Proteus is used in schools because somehow they 've managed to sweetheart a deal for extremely low cost to free licensing on that level in hopes to net students into depending on it for their professional carers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although not as newbie friendly it is technically full featured , even the free version . <p> For it 's function features and price , Eagle is the only real ' solution ' out there . There are many other choices , all which will require a learning curve and design of new libraries for components . 77966 @qwx697966 <p> I agree with Scead . Eagle ( besides being free ) is my favorite for board design simply because of how user-friendly it is . Also , if you do not need the simulator , that is just an extra feature in Proteus that would not make the price worth it . Another thing I have noticed with Proteus is that most of their work went into the simulation , not the board design aspect . It is more difficult to use than EAGLE , and does not seem to work as well . That is my personal preference , anyway . Perhaps someone here who has used Proteus for PCB design can point out some pros for it , but for the time being , my vote goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77967 @qwx697967 <p> I work for many companies . Each has a different , expensive , system that I do n't have time to learn and I ca n't afford . I down load Eagle and get the board made and working before anyone discovers I did not use the $100,000 software . <p> Eagle is really good for the price . It will never do a $10,000 job or a $30,000 job . For ( free/500 or 1000 ) it does a $5000 job . Yes thousands of users combine their libraries which is very important to me . I use LtSpice for sim so I do n't need that piece . <p> Thank you all very much for your comments , I have used Proteus for PCB design , but only simple designs , and no I do not use the simulation features of it particularly , I use it for a quick sanity check on PIC I/O but nothing that MPLAB Sim ca n't do I expect . <p> I am really getting into Eagle to do designs and just wanted to check I was on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on from where I am working , I am going to have to buy it for my own projects . <p> I have tried Eagle ( free ) and the lack of simulator and the totally baffling interface ( for a Protel/Proteus user ) really gave me headaches . If something is not intuitive enough for me to pick up without a manual I generally can not be bothered . I pretty much always make my own footprints and I love how intuitive it is to make multi part symbols linked up to a single footprint in Proteus ISIS and ARES ( FPGAs etc ) . KiCAD is not too bad for me ( at least the UI makes more sense for my tired brain ! ) but the libraries are really poor . <p> In regard to Scead , I have never seen Eagle used in Industry ( I have consulted a few times now ) , most companies seem to use Protel ( or it 's derivatives ) . <p> Last edited : Feb 25 , 2012 <p> I will not respond to PMs of a technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can contribute and benefit ! <p> My main issue is designing the footprints , I never seem to get them correct , maybe I am just rubbish at reading the datasheets for measurements ! lol <p> Rich , Again , thanks for the comments , I get on alright with the eagle interface , it is true Proteus is very easy to use ! Eagle is a bit more of a either love it or not , I use the " command line " rather than the point and click , I find it a bit easier , I am OK at making the schematic parts ( symbols ) , but I am not very good at doing components , I have read all of the " tutorials " which I must say are not *that* intuitive I find , I can do the ones they provide , but I admit I struggle to make footprints from datasheets . <p> If anybody has any really good tutorials for interpreting the datasheet measurements into footprints then please share ! I 'm sure I 'm just being thick , but I cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it is a lot of SMT stuff and BGA/LGA components etc are not very easy to gain confidence in until the prototype is made . <p> I did n't say Eagle was used in industry , only that it uses industry standards , which it does . There are no standards for schematic layout , simulation layout standards are all spice based , specific implementations are often not compatible with each other . <p> If you 're comfortable with Proteus and have the money to purchase it you are entitled to do so , those with limited means are forced to pursue other avenues that do n't require money , or pirate it . <p> I chose to use the free alternative software that is available out there as I do n't like using something I did n't pay for . <p> You are in a production oriented professional environment vs a hobbyist or small scale user which may be willing to spend more time on learning something new over spending a large amount of money . The VAST majority of users that come to this site are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a tiny handful of professionals . 77966 @qwx697966 <p> Another reason I prefer Eagle is that from my experience , more PCB manufacturers accept Eagle Files than accept ARES files . If you plan to get your boards made professionally , I think Eagle is the way to go . However , if you plan to make your own boards , I suppose ARES is okay for the job . At that point it comes right down to personal reference . 77967 @qwx697967 <p> Oops my bad Scead . Most PCB houses accept Gerber files , but Proteus only exports geber files correctly in Imperial - the metric output is always a mess and requires fixing of the Excellon drill file ( correcting the tool sizes from the readme file if anyone is reading this and facing such a dilemma ) . <p> I also dislike Pirate software - I will either have to buy Proteus or redraw all my footprints and symbols for odd parts I use in KiCAD or Eagle when I leave where I am , something I am not looking forward too . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all software adhered too . <p> There is also design spark these days which I heard can import the eagle libraries . Is it any good ? <p> I will not respond to PMs of a technical nature . Please post the question publicly such that everyone can contribute and benefit ! <p> I wish there was an open standard for symbols and footprints that all software adhered too . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> We all do , this is why standards are so powerful . But if you were a software maker that did what Proteus does , the last thing you would ever do is make it compatible with all other standards , their methods are the only one 's that make them money , why would they share them openly ?

I have become slacker over the years ... moaning does not help . Action does . <p> hi , Transistor are current controlled devices which control the flow of current thru a load , not voltage . <p> The voltages measured in a simple single stage amplifier are due to the current flowing from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of the current source that is powering the amplifier . <p> If the current source is say a 9V battery , the transistor amplifier is simply controlling the current flowing around the loop . The loop being the battery and transistor , the battery is supplying the current , not the transistor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thru the transistor from collector to emitter by a small current current flowing from base to emitter , so its said to have a current gain . <p> The transistor does not create the current , it simply controls the current flowing around the loop . <p> If you put your thumb over the end of a water hose to spray your friend with the resulting high pressure water , you then can control the water with small movements of your thumb . You 're amplifying small thumb movements and getting large differences in water output as a result , but have you created something from nothing ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I think I get it , but in this example you 're not really amplifying the current right ? I mean the water 's shooting out faster in a smaller stream but it 's still the same amount of water leaving the hose . I could imagine calling this increasing the voltage because it would cause the water pressure to build up in the hose but only inversely related to current , as in the case of a dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase voltage and current at the same time . <p> Is it kind of like the transistor allows you to draw more voltage or current from the battery than it 's rating ? Obviously it ca n't be just increasing the total energy in the circuit or there would be no energy crisis . <p> BJT transistors are voltage responding devices , as are FETs and tubes . The only basic current responding device I know of is a magnetic amplifier . As any transistor book will show , collector current Ic = Is*e(Vbe/Vt) , where Vbe is the base-emitter voltage , Is is the saturation current , and Vt is the thermal voltage , of which both the last two are relatively constant . This shows that the Vbe controls the current in the transistor . The base current Ib is ( Is/+ ) *e(Vbe/Vt) , where + is relatively constant for a particular transistor . It also shows that both Ic and Ib are exponentially responsive to Vbe . Dividing Ic by Ib cancels the exponential terms and gives the ratio + . So a BJT mimics a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled by Vbe . The base current is the unavoidable " waste current " that is present during operation in the active region . If the + were super high or infinity , there would not be any base current at all to worry about . Therefore , the Ib is a linear indicator of what the collector current is , but it is not controlling the collector current . Now one can make voltage amplifiers out of basic current amplifiers and current amplifiers out of basic voltage amplifiers by the using external circuitry , but that does not define what the basic active element is . <p> Is it kind of like the transistor allows you to draw more voltage or current from the battery than it 's rating ?

I ca n't really tell if there are any disadvantages to using logic level ones . Can anyone possibly she 'd some light on the advantages and disadvantages of either , besides the obvious one of gate voltage ? <p> THe advantage of logic level MOSFETs is that their source-drain saturates with at a low gate voltage .

One probably not so important , but the other is pretty important : -transconductance of standard MOSFETs is much higher than that of logic-level MOSFETs ... if that means anything to you . -Although a logic level MOSFET has lower resistance than a standard MOSFET with a logic level gate voltage ( ie. turning on vs not turning on ) , if you drive a logic level MOSFET and a standard MOSFET with a standard gate voltage ( &gt;10V ) , the standard MOSFET will have a LOWER on resistance . So there is actually a clear disadvantage when using logic level MOSFETs with standard gate drive voltages rather than standard MOSFETs . <p> THere was a document that described some differences from International Rectifier but I ca n't find it anymore . It is hard to find MOSFETs that have both a standard and logic level version . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the entire question is spawned by me trying to isolate the power section ( drivers and mosfets ) using optoisolators . I 'm using 12v to drive the drivers/mosfets , but the optocouplers want 5v . I ca n't seem to find optocouplers that can handle a 12v supply , so I was thinking to maybe try logic level MOSFETs . <p> Do you actually need galvanic isolation ? It 's a major pain in the ass . Also , remember an optocoupler actually has really crappy drive current . Optocoupler gate drivers usually need a power supply on the other side of the optocoupler to provide enough drive current to switch the MOSFET fast enough for high frequency operations . THe energy transmitted by the LED and received by the photodetector is enough to transmit the signal that the MOSFET should be switched , but does not actually have enough energy to do so .

As you can see the hydrogen tank is from praxair distribution . That means anyone can go in and rent one too ! Its about $28 a year for the lease on the tank and around $25 - $30 for a refill exchange . <p> However as you can see in the pictures the hydrogen tank is at around 1800 PSI , ( full is 2000 - 2400 typically ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to a safe level that a torch system uses . I just have the high pressure regulator output set up with a standard propane coupler so it can be used with the torch set without any regulator change over . <p> Using hydrogen for a cutting torch is super ! You do not need the oxygen gas mix turned on for the preheat flame . The flame itself does n't heat up metal to the glowing point , yet when you pull the cutting trigger you get a super hot jet right down the center of the torch flame and that starts cutting within seconds . Plus even without the oxygen mix going to the preheat flame it is incredible difficult to blow out ! propane and acetylene running at strait fuel only can be blown out with a good breath . Hydrogen wont do that ! So as you may guess that means very little fuel is needed to keep the torch going and no oxygen from your tank is even being used unless your actually cutting . <p> Every picture has a hydrogen flame in it but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , nearly Nothing ! Also those pictures with my own hand in them are with my skin under 1/2 inch way from the flame and I can assure you that until you actually touch it there is almost no heat radiating from it ! And when you do touch it its feels hot and moist , more like a steam jet . It will burn you within a second or two but its not anywhere near the intensity of a regular cutting torch flame . An actual acetylene or propane flame at that distance is very hot and will take the skin right off if I touched it for the same length of time that I can be in contact with hydrogen flame . <p> I just though you 'd like to see some truthful uses and actual pictures of hydrogen in a real life application . <p> And yes I do actually run small lawn and garden engines off of hydrogen and oxygen too ! ( The real life HHO comes from a pair of tanks ) And no , they do not put out more power that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair engine modifications they cant even put out as much power as when running on standard gasoline ! <p> But double the compression , change the ignition timing curves , and get a bigger and more aggressive cam profile , and Wow ! They can blow themselves apart with the actual power they then can produce ! that is , they can split the cast aluminum heads , crack pistons , and crush their own connecting rods ! So it your going to try running the real HHO gas , beef up your engine first or it will be a big disappointment power wise and an expensive rebuild if you do n't do it right ! <p> It does seem to work rather well for what little welding I have done with it . But no I have not actually used it for any serious gas welding . Hydrogen gas has some very weird characteristics as far as its heating ability goes ! Clean or dirty it does not seem to be to fussy about it ! On very rusty and dirty steel it appears like it almost reverts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning it off in a way I am not that familiar with . <p> Having a background in welding I am not that trusting of seeing what 's considered contamination just disappear into a weld . Welder logic just keeps me thinking its making the weld weaker . But could be wrong too ! <p> I have not tried aluminum with it yet . I think that will be on tonights things to do list ! 77965 @qwx697965 <p> I know this is a electronics forum but being hydrogen and its production are electrically related would anyone be interested in seeing an actual hydrogen powered home built gen set ? With the fuel system hooked up and running ? <p> It uses a stock 3.5 hp Briggs and Straton engine and a 1500 watt generator head . I have used this for the actual hydrogen testing . I have a modified gasoline carburetor on it that I reworked for vapor fuels . What I have done for the power testing is to put a 1500 watt heater on it for a load and just put the throttle up to full open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output . Amps * volts heater load measurement method . <p> On hydrogen and being this is an unmodified engine it can hardly top 1200 watts . <p> If your interested I will hook it up and take some pictures in the next day or so . 77965 @qwx697965 <p> I thought I would post a few things that may seem rather interesting about hydrogen and HHO gas . The real truths , not the enviro - overunity nutter versions . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Even saying the term " HHO " is nutter , though . There 's no such thing as " HHO gas " . You 're either talking about hydrogen gas or oxyhydrogen gas ( which is just pre-mixed hydrogen and oxygen in a 2:1 ratio ) . " HHO gas " is claimed to be entirely different from normal matter , comprised of " magnecules " and other nonsense . <p> Using hydrogen for a cutting torch is super ! You do not need the oxygen gas mix turned on for the preheat flame . The flame itself does n't heat up metal to the glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a super hot jet right down the center of the torch flame and that starts cutting within seconds . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> The cutting trigger turns on the oxygen , but otherwise it just burns with hydrogen in the atmosphere ? Hmm .... The reason Brown pre-mixed the O2 and H2 in a 2:1 ratio is because excess H2 will make metal brittle , and excess O2 will oxidize it . Also , oxyhydrogen burns at a higher temperature than plain hydrogen in air , and does n't produce as much NOx , if I remember correctly . <p> Every picture has a hydrogen flame in it but the one is what you would normally see in day light , nearly Nothing ! Also those pictures with my own hand in them are with my skin under 1/2 inch way from the flame and I can assure you that until you actually touch it there is almost no heat radiating from it ! <p> I typically use propane for the torch cutting purposes . Hydrogen does make a fair fuel for cutting purposes but its ultimately fairly expensive on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the elusive HHO gas to be an actual misrepresentation of common chemistry terminology . Water is technically hydrogen hydroxide HOH , not actually H2O ! Some where along the way somebody rewrote it as HHO and it stuck with the alternative fuels people that do not have much or any chemistry background . <p> Brown did some great work and good research but unfortunately he , like Tesla , got a poor following and much of his work is rather misrepresented or not accurately referenced to as to what he was really doing . <p> Under stoichiometric combustion water vapor and heat is supposed to be the only real by product of hydrogen combustion under normal conditions . But in reality any combustion with out a clean oxygen source will produce some trace NOx . Being hydrogen has an actually fairly low combustion temperature it is less prone to producing NOx byproducts . <p> I am not sure of the reasons for why it has so little radiated heat . And as its been explained to me the nearly clear flame is from not having any impurities to color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open hydrogen only flame has a pale violet color . And even though I did it at night with a most of my shop lights off and I still needed a background to get it to show up on camera . If the flash went off all you would get is what 's in the one picture . nearly nothing , but some trace heat wave distortion when viewing something behind it . In day light that color is invisible to the naked eye . All you see is the heat waves and even then a background is often needed for that to catch your attention if your not careful . Even when being burned with pure oxygen that pail blue/white flame is still rather hard to see in the day time . The hiss from the burning torch is the most obvious indicator its actually working ! <p> Having worked with it enough I have learned to be very careful in bright conditions . I have taken the hair off my hands and arms a few times from misdirecting an open flame . <p> If anyone has a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help dispel some more hydrogen myths please do so ! <p> I am trying to not come off as hydrogen crack pot but rather as someone that does have hands on knowledge and experience but still does not have the full and accurate facts to work with . 77965 @qwx697965 <p> Ah ... I think I am safe ? I do run engines on hydrogen and I know it works . I know my hydrogen &amp; oxygen come from commercial dealers in tanks . I know they make most of both gasses from electrolysis of water . I know the energy required Vs the efficiency of electrolysis plus the efficiency of an internal combustion engine equals about 10% return on the power initially used Vs the usable power returned as mechanical work by the engine . <p> So am I safely not a HHO nut ? But rather just a real honest experimenter using tested and valid reasoning ? <p> I do like those websites ! But why do so many have disproof of concept video that does not work ? At least the nuts provide a doctored or fake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was not so rational I would think the dis provers were the fakers by their lack of disproving evidence ! Almost make you wonder does n't it . 77965 @qwx697965 <p> Ah ... I think I am safe ? I do run engines on hydrogen and I know it works . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> No one has ever suggested you ca n't run an engine on hydrogen , and as for your lower efficiency figures you need to bear in mind the engine was optimised to run on petrol , so wo n't run anywhere near as well on hydrogen . <p> Be interesting to see what type of efficiency could be reached by an engine designed and optimised for hydrogen ? . <p> I have an idea where the hydrogen can come from : Power stations generate electricity at a certain capacity , but most of the time it 's not all being used ( not very efficient ) .

You are introducing two extra stages of energy conversion if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to see any benefits , the generator 's efficiency would have to drop off pretty damn rapidly as the load decreased . <p> hi Jules , You have to consider that a power station is only a small part of the National Grid , which is centrally controlled .

Also , in Britain there is supposed to be an energy shortfall where there are n't enough power stations / infrastructure to support the growing population and they ca n't build them fast enough . I do n't think we are going to be able to curb the mass-breeding so we need an alternative or improvement to the power generation and the capacity to do generate electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars is better than electric cars when the fossil fuels run out ? 
@@71811695 @511695/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> poles and zeros of Laplace transform <p> Q1 : For a system to be stable all of its poles should lie to the left of imaginary axis of the s-plane ; even if one pole lies to the right of the s-plane it would make the system unstable . If poles lie on the imaginary axis then the system is marginally stable . This is the criteria which is given in most places . But I have also been told that for a stable system the number of zeros and poles should be equal . I have found some sources which indirectly also support this . For instance , check out this source : <p> But the issue is that I have seen many functions which do n't have equal number of zeros and poles but still are considered stable ( please do n't forget that I 'm just a newbie to the Laplace ) . For example , s/ ( s+2 ) ( s+3 ) has poles at s=-2 , -3 and zero at s=0 . It 's considered stable in spite of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case . You can also check this source . This another source summarizes the stability this way . <p> The significance of zeros is explained after 10:25 in link #1 below . <p> Q2 : How do I interpret poles and zeros physically in context of circuits ? I understand that mathematically poles are roots of denominator and zeros are roots of numerator of a transfer function , H(s) = N(s)/D(s) = Y(s)/X(s) . My complete question is here . <p> Q1 : Stable systems have poles only in the left half plane - end of story . <p> The idea of number of poles and zeros being equal comes about if you count poles and zeros at infinity , which is a bit of a confusing ( even questionable ) notion . Your thought that you 've seen systems with more poles ( e.g. s/ ( ( s+2 ) ( s+3 ) ) ) comes about because we typically do not consider zeros at infinity . Let 's forget about the fact that s=GP is not a well defined point because s is complex . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ) as s -&gt; GP is 0 . So , in a sense this function has a zero at s=GP and if we count this as one of the zeros , this system has 2 zeros and 2 poles . <p> It 's one of those mumbo-jumbo things that does not really matter . <p> Q2 : is a difficult question to answer actually . <p> The significance of poles and zeros can depend on the system , although zeros relate to inputs , while poles relate to internal feedback . A zero blocks the path of an input signal basically . This is why only poles matter for stability . I 'm sure those words mean little to you now , but in time it should make sense . The simplest answer says that poles are places where the transfer function blows up and zeros are places where the transfer function is zero . However , that 's a cop out answer because it is too obvious and not very helpful for intuition . However , with experience , the pole-zero language is something you understand even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't worry too much about this . Just use the concepts and be patient that it will all make sense with experience . <p> However , here is a crude attempt to answer . The most significance can be seen in Bode plots because poles make the magnitude response decrease at 20 dB/dec and zeros make the response increase at 20 dB/dec and the effects are cumulative such that a pole and zero cancel and two poles or two zeros gives 40 dB/dec . The angle response picks up 90 lag for every pole an 90 lead for every pole . If you are not familiar with this , then wait till you start doing Bode plots and you will see it clearly . <p> The bottom line is that pole and zero frequencies in the complex domain give effects that we can see in the real frequency domain , which we typically display on a Bode plot . In a sense , the effect of the poles and zeros are indirectly manifesting themselves like shadows or reflections ( speaking poetically now ) . Only when poles or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) do we directly see the pole or zero on the Bode plot , and then it is truly a zero response or a blow-up point , at that frequency w . <p> As Steve mentioned , the transfer function s/ ( ( s+2 ) * ( s+3 ) ) has another zero at s=infinity . This is easy to see if we look at only the powers of s . In the numerator we have s to the first power , and in the denominator we have s to the second power because we end up with at least s2 in the denominator . This reduces it to : s/s2 which is clearly just 1/s , and as s goes to infinity 1/s goes to zero , so we get another zero . <p> That 's the short view , and the right way to do this is to take the derivative of the top and the derivative of the bottom and then we get : 1/ ( 2*s+5 ) <p> and then take the limit as s goes to infinity . As s goes to infinity ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignificant , so we are left with 1/infinity which is zero . <p> Just thought i would point that out as you will run into this many times . <p> If you look at the time equation at t=0 you 'll see it is equal to 1 , and stable around t=0. 77974 @qwx697974 <p> @Steve : I 'm sorry about the Q2 . I linked wrong attachment where I said " My complete question is here " at the end . Please have a look again and see if it 's somewhat easier for you to help me to understand some meaning of poles and zeros in context of that example or some other related example . <p> @MrAl : <p> and the right way to do this is to take the derivative of the top and the derivative of the bottom and ... <p> I would still give the same answer for Q2 , even with the more specific information in hand . <p> The one thing we can do now is apply the Bode plot rules to the specific system . This is a good example to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Matlab , try the following command , <p> sys=tf ( 4 16 0 , 2 12 1 ) <p> This creates a system called " sys " using the " tf " command which is the transfer function command . You can use the Matlab help command " help tf " to get the details about this command , but basically you are entering the polynomial coefficients for the numerator and denominator . <p> Once the system is defined try the following commands to get the poles and zeros of the system , <p> pole(sys) zero(sys) <p> You will find the zeros are at 0 and -4 , which you already knew , and the poles are at -5.92 -0.085 . What we see here is that the pole at -5.92 is relatively close to the zero at -4 , which means their effects cancel out somewhat . Hence a bode plot will look similar to a system with a zero at 0 and a pole at -0.085 . This means that the phase will start out at +90 deg. and the magnitude response will increase at 20 dB/decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will flatten out and the phase will come back to zero at higher frequency . <p> Use the " bode " command i Matlab to get the exact plot as follows , <p> bode(sys) <p> I 've attached the plot , but you should do this yourself to verify . <p> With experience , you can do approximate Bode plots just by knowing the locations of the polse and zeros . So , they tell you a lot about the frequency behavior of a circuit/system. 77964 @qwx697964 <p> However , here is a crude attempt to answer . The most significance can be seen in Bode plots because poles make the magnitude response decrease at 20 dB/dec and zeros make the response increase at 20 dB/dec and the effects are cumulative such that a pole and zero cancel and two poles or two zeros gives 40 dB/dec . The angle response picks up 90 lag for every pole an 90 lead for every pole . If you are not familiar with this , then wait till you start doing Bode plots and you will see it clearly . 77968 @qwx697968 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I better confirm it . I think it would be " The angle response picks up 90 lag for every pole and 90 lead for every zero " . Kindly let me know . Thank you . <p> Just do n't  get too comfortable with that because for many second order systems you 'll need a template of the curve It still helps to understand this stuff though . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> As you can see there is a typo so I thought I better confirm it . I think it would be " The angle response picks up 90 lag for every pole and 90 lead for every zero " . Kindly let me know . Thank you . <p> Regards PG 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Yes , that is correct . <p> As MrAl is cautioning , these Bode plot rules are meant to indicate tendencies for the Bode plot , not the actual response . If poles and zeros are very far apart , you will see the ( nearly ) full angle develop in the plot , and with the magnitude rules , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole and zero are exactly equal , they will perfectly cancel , but if they are merely close to each other , they will not perfectly cancel and you will see some small differences . Also , when two poles are very near ( or equal , or complex conjugates of each other ) the behavior is modified and the details ( which relates to second order system properties : oscillatory , damped or critically damped ) matter . <p> These rules ( developed by Bode ) were very important in the era before computers ( or calculators ) were readily available to engineers . They needed to make plots quickly for design and the rules ( there are more rules by the way ) allowed making quick plots , without having to manually find points with a slide rule . Those guys were fast with the slide rule , but doing complex math calculations for many points to make a plot is tedious and time consuming . <p> However , we are very lucky to have Matlab as a design tool to do the heavy labor for us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , make Matlab your very good friend as you learn this stuff . <p> Q1 : Stable systems have poles only in the left half plane - end of story . <p> The idea of number of poles and zeros being equal comes about if you count poles and zeros at infinity , which is a bit of a confusing ( even questionable ) notion .

So , in a sense this function has a zero at s=GP and if we count this as one of the zeros , this system has 2 zeros and 2 poles . <p> It 's one of those mumbo-jumbo things that does not really matter . 77968 @qwx697968 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real number . When we say that s--&gt;GP or s=GP , what does it really mean ? As you also implied that s=GP is not a well defined point because s is complex , I also see it this way . In my view , we ca n't say that s=GP unless " j- " is zero which then means that -=GP . Please guide me here . Thank you . <p> In my opinion , it does not have a precise meaning because it is vague . However , for our purposes , it is not really a critical problem . If either - or - go to infinity , those typical transfer functions go to zero . So , in a sense , there is a zero at infinity . <p> I 'm not a mathematician , but I like to visualize this as a large infinite diameter circle , and there is a zero at all points on this circle . Yet still we are calling this one zero , as if it is one point . It 's a bit of a strange concept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point from the book is not a critical idea at all in practical applications , but it is good to be exposed to it at least in a cursory way . I also learned this back in school , but I have n't thought about it in over 20 years until you brought up the question . This is one of those pretty looking fruits that you can only squeeze a tiny amount of juice out of , ... the juice being a metaphor for practical value , and the prettiness hinting at the conceptual symmetry implied by the mathematics . <p> In my opinion , it does not have a precise meaning because it is vague . However , for our purposes , it is not really a critical problem . If either - or - go to infinity , those typical transfer functions go to zero .

It 's a bit of a strange concept , but it works well enough . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I have tried to understand your visualization of an infinite circle . Here is my attempt . Kindly guide me if it 's too wrong . I understand you were talking about it generally but I thought of exploring it further out of curiosity . Thanks a lot . <p> Regards PG 77964 @qwx697964 <p> These are interesting thoughts . I think you are seeing why I mentioned this is a vague concept , especially the way it is presented in engineering books . I do n't think mathematicians would like our approach . <p> You mentioned j- going to infinity , but instead think of - going to infinity . This has a clearer meaning . The j is there in s=-+j- , but - and - are the variables that would actually be set to a number , or be varied in a limiting process . <p> I like how you used the polar form s=r exp(j++) . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no real circle , as you seem to have pointed out . It 's just a mental concept to think of the zero as if it exists at the infinite perimeter of the two dimensional space . <p> Again , I do n't see a lot of usefulness in this . Perhaps the one place where you might care about this is when doing Bode plots . Then the concept of a limit as - goes to infinity has a usefulness if you start at -=GP and work back to -=0 . However , I think most people prefer to start at -=0 and think of how poles and zero 's affect the magnitude and phase response . Poles and zeros at -=0 are much easier to think about . Then , you never need to worry about those zeros ( or even poles ) at infinity . They are just out there to balance the scales , but otherwise , who cares ? 77964 @qwx697964 <p> It 's not clear why you think that . The math says the phase is zero at w=0 , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just write out the voltage divider equation to find the transfer function . Remember that Xc=1/ ( jwC ) . Including the j is important . Then take the limit as w goes to zero and then again as w goes to infinity . <p> The math says the phase is zero at w=0 , and then it goes to -90 at w=infinity. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Yes , the math says so and I 'm not saying math is incorrect . But in some cases conceptual understanding should take precedent . If I ca n't make ' conceptual ' sense of phase response of a RC circuit then I 'm totally hopeless when it comes to more complex circuits . So , please help me . If it 's still not clear to you where I 'm having trouble then kindly let me know . Thank you . 77964 @qwx697964 <p> The diagram you show in the last post is for a transfer function T=V/I , which is also the total impedance Z of the circuit . Here you would be correct that the phase is -90 at -=0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what your original question is referring to . The original question was for transfer function T=Vo/Vi . This is a different situation . Instead of comparing the phase of the voltage and current on the supply , we are comparing the phase between the supply voltage and the load voltage . <p> In this case , -=0 means the supply is directly on the load and no drop is across the resistor . Well , if it 's the same voltage , then obviously they are in phase . As a byproduct , the current is 90 degrees out of phase with the supply voltage because capacitors always have a 90 degree lag on current . <p> However as - goes to GP , most of the voltage goes on the resistor ; hence the current is in phase with the supply . The capacitor is in series and has the same current , and the capacitor always has voltage and current out of phase by 90 degrees . Hence , when - goes to infinity , the supply and the load voltages must be 90 degrees out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your description . For example , it is not correct that a capacitor is an open circuit and that as soon as the switch is thrown Vc=Vi . A capacitor looks like an open circuit to DC , only a long time after the switch is thrown . When the switch is first thrown , the capacitor looks like a short circuit , and current flows as the capacitor is charged up . <p> You are correct to stress the point , " assume that the source is sinusoidal " . That is a key point . But , it 's important to remember that a sinusoidal signal must exist for a long period of time , so that transient effects can die off . Throwing a switch is a transient act , so here you do n't need to think about what happens right when the switch is thrown . However , a long time after the switch is thrown , your way of thinking is probably good enough to get the point . <p> Another way to think about it is to note that a very slow sine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order that the cap voltage can follow the input source voltage . This creates a very small phase angle . 77964 @qwx697964 <p> The " s " in question is indeed the normal s=-+j- Laplace complex frequency parameter . The whole reason for considering s=j- is that this is how we obtain our Bode plots for the system . Whenever , you see Bode plots with magnitude and phase , they are obtained from the transfer function by substituting j- in place of s . The values are complex , so we need both magnitude and phase to represent the number in polar form . <p> Now , why do we care about j- ? Basically , because this restricts the input functions to pure sinusoidal functions with frequency - . <p> In the case you mentioned , you had a two poles at -1 and a zero at s=-2 . These poles and this zero are not on the j- axis , so you will not see the bode plot blow up ( poles blow up , right ? ) at -=-1 and it wo n't go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . So , there is generally no need to worry about comparing pole/zero locations and s=j- substitutions . <p> Sometimes poles or zeros end up on the jw axis , and then you will see them on the Bode plots . For example , your zero at 0 will result in a Bode plot that goes to zero at DC . If you had an example with poles on the imaginary axis , then the Bode plot would go to infinity at the frequency corresponding to the pole .

Will it run all day for 8 hours and not over heat or does it need a cooling fan ? Will it block 60KHz and pass 15 VDC ? ? ? ? ? IT sounds like a Try again , Guess again project to me . <p> But A Better Torroid would be a 77 or 78 Material . And it should be Fairly large to use Large Wire as needed . 77968 @qwx697968 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem but I keep getting crazy answeres . <p> Does this symbol * mean multiply ? <p> If so math appears to be wrong . <p> You have .079324 * 26 = 79.32 Turns <p> I get .079324 times 26 = 2.06 <p> Yes the 77 material looks like a good choice . OK I see what we are doing here . This is a way to calculate the number of turns without experementing to figure it out . This is good to determine the toroid size so I know it will be large enough for the required number of turns . Now what about wire size ? Assume 15 amps in the circuit according to the online wire charge = #14 copper wire . Wire charts are for 60Hz but what will 60 KHz do to the wire on a toroid ? Power suppy is 15 VDC and my meter reads 8.4 amps but RF voltage is 70 VAC at 60 KHz . <p> I used 42 enamel coated #30 copper wires . I twisted them a little just so they would be easy to put through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns of wire . Cross sectional area of 42 wires is = to 14 gauge copper wire rated for 15 amps .

Maybe #14 solid wire would get warm because it is less surface area and less cooling than 42 seperate wires . <p> 2 toroids with 11 turns of wire = 1 uh so 9 toroids with 11 turns of wire should be 4.5 mh .

And it should be Fairly large to use Large Wire as needed . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Very good post . <p> I would like to add what little I know about toroids , or think I know . <p> 1 . The color of the toroid indicates the material it is made from , thus permeability , etc . Basically toroids are poorly marked . The colors are not standardized between manufacturers . They usually have no markings at all . If you buy a toroid with no manufacturers markings on the package , plan to spend some time finding out what it is for . <p> 2 . The size of the toroid ring determines the number of turns , and the size of wire that can be wound on them . It also determines the saturability of the toroid . Again , as I understand it , the a toroid is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the coil to the inner . A point is reached where there is no capacity in the toroid for a larger field . As I understand it , this is the saturation point . The larger the cross sectional area of the toroid , the more field it can accept . <p> 3 . When winding a core , try to keep the number of turns to a reasonable number . You do n't want a tiny toroid with 47 layers of wire wrapped on it . As I understand it , moving the windings away from the toroid , as multiple layers would , can affect the value of inductor . <p> 4 . Use double sided tape between the toroid and first winding , and between each layer . It makes it easier , but not easy , to keep the turns in place . <p> If there is any DC current in the winding that could easily lower the inductance that you see when you only have an AC current . This means it saturates easier and steps have to be taken to minimize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application you intend to use this for have any DC current ? 77974 @qwx697974 <p> If there is any DC current in the winding that could easily lower the inductance that you see when you only have an AC current .

Sometimes they tell about the resistor 's temperature coefficents which are not much of use for normal electronics experiments . <p> But there are two resistor body colors which you should know what they need if you 're fixing some electronics circuit . Resistor body colors white and blue are used to mark non-flammable resistors and fusible resistors . If you encounter tjis type of resistor in the circuit do not replace it with normal reistor because this would cause fire danger is something goes wring in the circuit . Non-flammable resistors and fusible resisotrs are designed so that they do n't catch fire when they overheat . When fusible resistor overheats it cuts the current flowing like a fuse .

An incandescant bulb would dim , some things do n't run , other things run poorly - generally called a " brownout " .

I also have limited space on the bike . <p> Hope someone can help . <p> Regards Glyn Pickering New Zealand 77968 @qwx697968 <p> i do n't  think so . a capacitor is not the same as that of a battery . u cant use the two interchangably. a capacitor is not a continuous supply of energy . a charged capacitor discharges immediately depending upon the RC time constant of the external circuit . u will have to use a battery to operate your lights and horn . a capacitor is simply a frequency dependent resistor which can be used to store energy . do n't  get the usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ok . So long as you realise that the capacitor wo n't run the lights for long without the engine running . It wo n't run them for very long at all without the engine running . In fact the capacitor may run out of charge before the engine has come to rest after switching off . The ' lighting coil ' gives quite a ' lumpy ' output , generally these run of the same magnet assembly that the ignition system uses , and for those who do n't know , its not evenly spaced around the fly wheel . Its very much all over one side , the fly wheels are usually cast with a shape that will even out the weight distribution and also machined to balance up . The magnet assembly is actually two magnets positioned near together so that between them there is a fairly high magnetic field . It is this that is used , in conjunction with the points to make the ignition spark . That 's why the flywheel has to be positioned with respect to engine tdc . <p> I mention this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same magnets , gets a very lumpy voltage . What it gets is a sort of spike , every revolution of the engine . Now when its driving filament lamps that matters little , it will even out as an RMS load lighting the lamp . When the engine revs are low , like tick-over the lights can be noticeably flickering . <p> If you want to fit a capacitor on this i would mention two things , firstly with the lights off , or failed lamps , the cap will charge far too highly . I suggest a ten or twelve volt zener as limiter , so that it should not charge to an awkwardly high voltage , which could pop the lamps if switched on when its charged , or blow the capacitor if not restrained . <p> Secondly i suggest you use a diode bridge rather than one diode so that you get the best use of the output from the lighting coil . Using just a single sided output will give a higher spike to output ratio . You will probably find one side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge you would have to free that end , to make the coil ' floating ' that is with both ends free . <p> Using a capacitor will give a much better light from the lamps , i think that this is something that a lot of people do with these types of bikes . <p> Best of luck with it , John just seen russlk 's post , he has done this too with 3000MFD , i would have guessed at more like 10,000 , but see how it goes - John <p> If the bike needs to be street legal it wo n't work - headlights on trail bikes ( and many smaller motor bikes ) commonly have the headlamps fed direct from the flywheel alternator - this results in the lights seriously dimming as you slow down ( you would need a hell of a big capacitor to try and stop that ! ) . The indicators and brake lights are usually fed from a smallish lead acid battery , which is charged from the alternator - as you slow down ( and charging current disappears ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For an indication of capacitor size use the formula C=IT , so assuming a 10amp headlamp bulb , and 10 seconds of capacity - that means a 100 FARAD capacitor - big beast ! . <p> If you wire it as normal , using a standard motorcycle battery , it wo n't affect starting at all even if the battery is totally flat - it will simply start charging as soon as you start the engine . <p> Perhaps Russlk would let us know what the capacitor did on his BSA ( sorry , but I do n't recognise the model ) - presumably it was only to power the ignition ? . One device I do remember on various British bikes ( not sure if it was BSA or Triumph ) was a large zener diode on a heatsink just below the headlamp - this was to prevent the battery getting overcharged at high revs . <p> This is from:http : **32;852;TOOLONG it says dirt track racer , but this version looks street legal to me . They may have also been known as ' Shooting star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street version . <p> The generators on some of these dirt bikes had permanent magnet fields , so voltage control was by excess power sinking ( wasting ) using fairly meaty zener units . <p> Simple but effective , although they were prone to failures from overheating damaging the wires and connections close to the unit . ( at least the ones i met were , but then i did n't usually get to meet them till there was a failure )

If you have n't been specifying it , they 're all part of the Default class which has no width specified , so width defaults to 10mils during the Routing stage . <p> So , go under Edit-&gt;Net Classes , Default-Width-30 mils ( or whatever floats your boat ) . You can also add say a Power class and make it thicker . You can specify this when making connections . Or you can Edit-&gt;Change-&gt;Net Classes , select Power , double click on each wire you want to become part of the Power class . This is how you can have thick and thin wires coexisting on the same design . <p> It is also possible to route the board and change with width of individual trace segments . Generally this is not the right way to do it and it will raise warnings on your Design Rule Check but it 's otherwise ok . Sometimes you have to do this to make a thick power trace used for Vdd or Gnd turn into a thin trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine pitch SMD pad without extending over the neighboring pads . <p> To do it the ' incorrect way ' . There 's a ' change ' icon on the toolbar ( looks like a wrench ) . If you select it , it will give you a list of things you can change . Select width , then the trace width you want to change to . Then just start clicking on the traces you want to enlarge . The traces will change to the width you specified . <p> or , use group to select all your traces , use change/width , then right click on anything in the " selected group " and all traces in the group will be set to the selected width . If you display only top and bottom layers before doing that , you can avoid changing other lines ( like on the silkscreen or what ever ) . <p> in general , group is a very powerfull tool to use in conjunction with other tools . For example , you can rip-up an area of the board via this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . and so on . <p> Um yeaaah ... that 's the wrong way to do it ( yet somehow you still want to bring it up ? ) . You put the board out of sync with the schematic for no reason at all , and it basically ca n't be undone so it will curse your design forever . Do n't do it . This is only appropriate if you want to make some branches of a net a different width than others ( like the aforementioned SMD case ) or you do n't have the schematic ( in the odd scenario that you are given a board with no schem ) . <p> I do n't think there is anything wrong with it . I do it all the time and never get out of sync. maybe you are closing the schematic and modifying the BRD ? that 's a way bad idea as it does cause sync problems . <p> DRC will only complain if you make the trace narrower than the default for the class . which kind of makes sense . for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HBridges , I beef up the power trace to something appropriately wide - like 50 mil . it 's a power trace but needs more current . DRC is happy as a clam. yeah , I could create a special class but for a couple of traces , it 's not worth it . <p> Yep , there is . This thread solved three of my problems , one I had not ran into yet . <p> I found the wrench before I posted , and selected the traces and did not see them get thicker . I will try again night . I will group , click the new size and print it , maybe it is not visible on the screen . <p> But that 's again guys . I think this will be a good search items for the forum .

Also Ohms Law , as defined does not mention linearity . <p> E 77969 @qwx697969 <p> From the University of Guelph ( Canada ) we have the following definition : <p> 1 . Ohm 's Law deals with the relationship between voltage and current in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( voltage ) across an ideal conductor is proportional to the current through it . The constant of proportionality is called the " resistance " , R. Ohm 's Law is given by : <p> V = I R <p> where V is the potential difference between two points which include a resistance R. I is the current flowing through the resistance . For biological work , it is often preferable to use the conductance , g = 1/R ; In this form Ohm 's Law is : <p> I = g V <p> 2 . Material that obeys Ohm 's Law is called " ohmic " or " linear " because the potential difference across it varies linearly with the current . <p> In this subchapter we will give an outline of how to progress from the simple version of Ohms " Law " , which is a kind of " electrical " definition for a black box , to a formulation of the same law from a materials point of view employing ( almost ) first principles . In other words : The electrical engineering point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linear relation between the ( dc ) current I flowing through it and the voltage U applied to it , it is an ohmic resistor . The ( extreme ) Materials Science point of view is : Tell me what kind of material is in the black box , and I tell you : <p> If it is an ohmic resistor , i.e. if the current relates linearly to the voltage for reasonable voltages and both polarities ; and <p> What its ( specific ) resistance will be , including its temperature dependence . <p> There are really two different interpretations of what is " ohmic " and what is not .

It was written by David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Resnick , Professor of Physics , Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute <p> LONG ... " We stress the relationship V=I*R is NOT a statement of Ohm 's law . A conductor obeys Ohm 's law only if its V vs . I curve is linear , that is , if R is independent of V and I. The relationship R=V/I remains as the general definition of the resistance of a conductor whether or not the conductor obeys Ohm 's law . . . . . . . . . Ohm 's law is a specific property of certain materials and is NOT a general law of electromagnetism , for example , like Gauss 's law . " LONG ... <p> Next a quote from another college textbook called Physics for Scientists &amp; Engineers , by Raymond Serway , Third Edition , 1990 , page 745 . It was written by Raymond A. Serway of James Madison University <p> LONG ... " A current density J and an electric field E are established in a conductor when a potential difference is maintained across the conductor . If the potential difference is constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the current density in a conductor is proportional to the electric field in the conductor . that is J=sigma*E where sigma is called the conductivity of the conductor . Materials that obey the above equation are said to follow Ohm 's law , named after Georg Simon Ohm ( 1787-1854 ) . More specifically , <p> Ohm 's law states that for many materials ( including most metals ) the ratio of the current density and electric field is a constant , sigma , which is independent of the electric field producing the current . <p> Materials that obey Ohm 's law , and hence demonstrate this linear behavior between E and J , are said to be ohmic . The electrical behavior of most materials is quite linear for very small changes in the current . Experimentally , one finds that not all materials have this property . Materials that do not obey Ohm 's law are said to be nonohmic . Ohm 's law is not a fundamental law of nature , but an empirical relationship valid only for certain materials . " LONG ... <p> OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the linearity between voltage and current , not relationship between voltage , current , and resistance . Yet the formula , V = I*R has been misnamed across countless classrooms , books and discussions . What does your textbook or school teach ? <p> To summarize , certain materials like conductive metals follow Ohm 's law , in that their V vs.I curve is linear . Ohm 's law is a property of a material , not a general law of nature . Other conductive entities like diode junctions or gas discharge bulbs do not have the Ohm 's law property , because their conductivity changes depending on what voltage or current is applied , causing their V vs . I curve to be nonlinear . In all cases , V = I*R is always correct , but it should not be called Ohm 's law . It should be called the resistance or impedance formula . <p> No matter what you call V = I*R , circuits will still get designed and analyzed , and science will still progress .

( It is the output enable signal that drives them in anti phase . ) Also if you look at typical applications on paged 8 to 10 you will see in most cases the output transistors are connected in parallel so they must be in phase . <p> Edit . I have just realised that from figure 6 only one output transistor can be active at a time so the comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I was thinking when I made my last post , I 'm sure I 've seen a circuit that switches from sequential drive to parallel drive as a means of reducing the power , that 's obviously how its done , probably a sense resistor and a tranny switching the enable line on the ic . <p> Hi spec , Your suggestion is wonderful . After getting up in the morning I saw your suggestion and tried immediately . I found the trigger set as alternate . When I change it to single , output is perfect . Extremely thankful , spec .

@@71811715 @511715/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Light Frequency Detection <p> Hello , I have been googling to try and figure out how to go about designing and building the circuit described below , but alas I ca n't seem to find the correct terminology to zero in on the types of components I need , let alone the design . <p> Overview : I would like to construct a device to measure for the presence of certain light frequency/frequencies . It could be done one at a time ( choose which frequency to test for ) or sample a range and display the results . A similar example to what I want to build can be found here : <p> Use : Plants have certain frequencies of light they require for vegetation and fruit/flowering . When growing indoors , the critical frequencies of sunlight must be reproduced . Traditionally this is achieved through broad spectrum lighting such known as High Intensity Discharge and achieved using metal halide type or high pressure sodium . These are VERY hot and power hungry . The new type of lighting is with LEDs . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of the frequency of light they emit . <p> For example , red LEDs are typically just above the range that plants like most , so the best lights are ones where you can evaluate a large sample of red LEDs and choose the ones closest to the target frequency for the light . <p> I would like to build a sensor that can evaluate a spectrum of light , or take individual frequency samples , to assess the effectiveness of the light and suitability for use as a growing light . You can see the attachment for a diagram of the light spectrum . <p> LED manufactures of course provide diagram showing their LED frequency . I simply want my own independent way to quickly and simply evaluate the frequency for experimentation , and also to evaluate other lighting systems . <p> Question : So , my simple question is : What type of detectors/components are suitable for detecting specific frequencies of light ? I 'm mostly concerned with the detection at this point , not the actual building of the whole circuit . 77964 @qwx697964 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like they would work . You can pick their wavelength sensativity in a pretty wide range . Check out Digi-Key Corporation - USA Home Page and search for photodiode They sell 657 different kinds from 254nm 's to 1300nm 's Note this is just the ' peak ' wavelength , they 'll pick up others so you 'll probably want to use a filter over the sensor , filters for those specific frequencies may be hard to find . Take a look at Wikipedia 's entry on photo diodes and look at the spec sheets for the diodes on Digikeys website and you should have a better clue of where to proceed . You may be able to google for photo diode circuits to get an idea of how people typically use them . With a good filter a photo diode should be pretty accurate . <p> Last edited : Mar 25 , 2009 77966 @qwx697966 <p> Okay , I looked at some of the photodiodes and they provide the correct function I 'm looking for ( detecting frequency ) , but is n't the accuracy a problem ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emitted light , and the photodiode manufacture also shows a datasheet of the expected response curves , but does n't one of them have to be known to be accurate in order to make a valid test ? <p> In practical terms it means that I see a red LED and it looks red , and my photodiode detector says it 's red , but given the variance in each part there 's no way to know if it 's the actual 625 nm frequency I 'm looking for . <p> Since the LEDs or other light sources will vary , at a minimum then I at least need to calibrate the detector with a known light source , or I need a detector that can be used to determine the frequency within some narrow range of error . <p> Preferably I would be able to sample the incoming light at a variety of fixed frequencies . Photodiodes could work if there were more available for different frequencies , then I could build a circuit with dozens spread out over the spectrum give more sample points . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filter with know specs to ensure only light of a certain frequency is passing through . <p> You pretty much have it nailed there bibb , it 's not easy , not if you want that precises a measure of specific wavelengths . Diode 's + filters would be required and filters would be expensive and difficult if not impossible to find or construct for such a narrow bandwidth . You could look into commercial optical spectrometers but the price would probably kill you . 77966 @qwx697966 <p> I just thought , for calibration you can use LED 's they are a narrow if not mono chromatic light source ( excluding white LED 's ) And measuring a ' white ' light source ( the sun ) you can get a feel for the responce curve of the various photo diode 's you 're using . 77966 @qwx697966 <p> I have also had a interest in this topic for use in a greenhouse environmental monitoring ( and one day control ) project that I 'm working on in my spare time . <p> I thought I 'd add the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400-700nm is what is referred to as Photosynthetic Active Radiation ( PAR ) or Photosynthetic Photon Flux ( PPF ) . It is , as you might suspect , the wavelength of light that plants require for photosynthesis . <p> The key with measuring this narrow band of wavelength is having the proper photodiode and even more importantly the proper filter on the sensor head . There are a handful of vendors of PAR/PPF sensors out there , Licor is one Apogee is another . Depending on your point of view , the price really is n't all that bad ( at least for Apogee ) considering the accuracy of the measurement that you get in return . Of course , if you wanted a dozen of these , then you 'd really start to feel the pain . <p> Several years back the B.C. Ministry of Forest required a quantity of these sensors for their research . They decided to roll their own to keep their budget reasonable and were generous enough to publish the results . They experimented with various photodiodes and were able to obtain decent results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document as a guide in building my own sensors at some point down the road when I have the time , meanwhile I purchased one from Apogee to get me up and running and to use as a " standard " for comparison purposes when I do get around to taking a shot at building these from scratch . <p> White LED 's cover between about 400 and 700nm 's but it 's very peaky . You 'd have to buy a white LED from a manufacture that published it 's output curve in order to use it to offset the perceived brightness . 77966 @qwx697966 <p> Niceone tcmtech , I 'd never have thought of that and now I 'll never forget it = ) Home brew optical spectrum analyzer .. A piece of glass &lt;smirk&gt; Add a digital camera and put it in a dark room taking short exposures and you could probably come up with a curve of the relative strength of the various output frequencies of a white LED . Old copiers laser printer or CD/DVD rom drives tend to have really high quality optical prisms in them . 77966 @qwx697966

If you have this type of system you will probably find that when the door is locked , you should have 12v on the unlock wire . and when the door is unlocked you should have 12v on the lock wire . If you have this type of system , all you have to do is ' ground ' the relevant wire to lock/unlock the doors . <p> The system can be overridden by connecting the external power source correctly . <p> As far as I could read the negative terminal of the power source was n't mentioned and therefor disregarded for testing . <p> The rocker switch for locking and unlocking has normally three positions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position neither lock nor unlock should be energized . <p> Leaving the switch in the neutral ( off ) position and using an external power source directly on the lock/unlock wires the negative terminal of this power source must be connected to the car chassis . Otherwise nothing wo n't work . <p> I 'm not sure what model Isuzu you have , but I have managed to download this wiring diagram which I think is common to a few Isuzu 's . <p> If yours is wired like this , then applying a 12v feed to the lock/unlock wires is not the way to go . Personally , I would take the 3 wires which connect to the switch , and use these ( it depends on whether you can connect to these physically ie. design of the switch ) <p> The ' common ' symbol in Fingaz ' schematic denotes a Negative ( Ground ) signal is required . <p> Assuming this schematic applies to the vehicle concerned : <p> A simple test .... leave the switch installed and probe the Lock &amp; Unlock wires in turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that the central locking works as intended , since the ground path is completed through the test lamp filament . <p> Thanks for the diagram I will work on it early next week . I will then be able to tell if it is the same or not . Briefly looking at it , it looks good . Thanks for finding it , I was spending a long time scouring the net looking for help . <p> First you should determine if the lock/unlock wires you found rest at ground ( ground when switch is centered ) . Or when you move the switch to unlock , and you have 12v at the unlock wire , check to see if you have ground at the lock wire , or vice versa.If you find one of the above to be true , you have a reverse polarity type , sometimes called 4 or 5 wire reversing/alternating , and you will need to add spdt relays . <p> i have a 93 trooper citation , ive bought a remote keyless entry kit.

@@71811719 @511719/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> interrupt vs polling <p> Hi , I ve been confused by the concepts of these 2 : interrupt and polling . , polling means the MCU keeps checking a flag to indicate if something happens . With interrupt , MCU is free to do other things , and when " something " happens , an interrupt is generated to notify the MCU . So it means the MCU does not need to check the flag ! ! ! ! That 's the theory . However , I remember with TMR0 , when overflow occurs , an interrupt generated which makes pin T0IF in INTCON reg High . Therefore the MCU also needs to check this flag to determine if the interrupt occurs . : ? Why ? : ? : so what the advantages of interrupt ? Thanks <p> Interrupts are a little confusing to people who just have software experience . Special hardware in the controller is looking at the interrupt flag . When an interrupt occures the hardware causes a jump to the interupt routine without any software help . The CPU and the special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be dooing something else and the special interrupt hardware is still looking at the interupt flag . When the interupt occures the interrupt hardware take control of the CPU and instead of executing the next instruction it saves where the next instruction is ( so it can come back ) and jumps to a special memory location in the code and the CPU then starts executing from that point . There is a special instruction to jump back to the saved memory location and resume executing from where the CPU left off . <p> 1 . Interrupts are used when you need the fastest response to an event . For example , you need to generate a series of pulses using a timer . The timer generates an interrupt when it overflows and within 1or2 usec , the interrupt service routine is called to generate the pulse . If polling were used , the delay would depend on how often the polling is done and could delay response to several millisecs . This is thousands times slower and the pulse generated will be jittery . <p> 2 . Interrupts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powered applications , the microcontroller is put to sleep by stopping all the clocks and reducing power consumption to a few microamps . Interrupts will awaken the controller from sleep to consume power only when needed . Applications of this are hand held devices such as TV/VCR remote controllers . <p> You forgot : 3 ) . Interrupts can be a far more efficient way to code . If you need to respond to TMR0 overflow , you 'd have to be putting checks for TMR0IF all over the place . In the middle of every loop . Just how often depends on how far you can let an interrupt go unanswered . If TMR0 is going to be a clock source , you might have TMR0 overflow a second time before it gets addressed and there 's absolutely no way to know that happened , so you could " lose " counts off your clock periodically . <p> It 's a given that if you use polling , the polling rate should be faster than the rate the event occurs . If you can not poll at that rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond to the event in a timely way . My case #1 above applies . I seldom need to resort to interrupts if the event is slower than a millisec rate . PICs will give you enough speed to poll at that rate for most applications . <p> Interrupts can also be inefficient in coding . Variables , specially 16-bit ones , that are modified within an interrupt service routine can not be accessed in the main program without checks to see if they were altered in between instructions . If extra care is not taken , it might produce bugs that will take days to track down . <p> I make it a practice to segregate registers that are written during ISRs so that they are accessed with care in the main program . IMO , to use interrupts just to improve coding is not good . <p> However , I remember with TMR0 , when overflow occurs , an interrupt generated which makes pin T0IF in INTCON reg High . Therefore the MCU also needs to check this flag to determine if the interrupt occurs . : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flag when you have multiple interrupt sources ( for example timer and portb change ) . Since all interrupts jump to the same location you 'll have to test the flag to know which interrupt was triggered . It 's not polling , just determining the cause of the interrupt . <p> If you know that only the timer would generate interrupts you do n't need to check the flag anymore . <p> : idea : Just a tip for people who now " understand " the theory but are wondering how the hell to use int 's ( as most coders call em in comments ) ....... <p> Refering to other comments about making sure that the int regisiters do n't get mixed up with your main code register I usually use " flags " . <p> What are flags ? well imagine we all had usa style , outside , letter boxes ...... at night you put the red " flag " down on the letter box sometime later ( usually in the morning ! ) you will look out of the window and check to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , you have mail , you go outside and get it , the postbox has been updated by the post(mail)man interrupt ! ...... <p> If you are still following ( awake ! ) ..... how do this help in a pic ? ? ? Well if we want to start a timer for say 10ms we can " clear " a flag ( like the mailbox ) that is " cleared " in the int routine ( like the mailman ) . This means that we can do other stuff in pic code and then check the timer " ocassionally " maybe every 100uS , OK we may loose a bit of accuracy , but we have had very little code outlay ..... PLUS ! ! ! we can have several flags all cleared by the same int routine ...... <p> OK I am gon na lie down for a bit ...... If anyone needs to see some code , let me know ! <p> Nice analogy : wink : , but I would say that is the analogy of polling instead of using the interrupt . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mail you 'll be instantly teleported to your mailbox , pick up the mail and then instantly return to what you were doing before . So you can do whatever you want and still you know you wo n't miss the mail . The flag in this case is not necessary . <p> Now suppose you have more mail boxes . Even if you are instantly teleported to them you need to know which mailbox has mail and the flags are useful for this . <p> I give here a small difference ( it should be noted ) that as coming to an interrupts , you have to save WREG , STATUS , PCL , PCLATH , because the current ones may be overwrite . And you will lost the current values when you get back your program at where you leave to interrupts . <p> But with polling , you do n't have to do this , because you are working with it . And you know the current values . <p> It 's important to note that , perhaps many interrupts occur at the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , it 's easy but someone may forget it . And it will run interrupts again immediately after the first interrupt , after RETFIE instruction . <p> We should end ( or begin , in somecase ) the interrupt subroutine with clearing relative flag . Do n't clear flags at the begin or the end of the whole interrupt service routine . <p> I prefer using interrupts in small applications because it makes the programs clear . But the fact that , real world applications usually work at lower speed than milliseconds . Therefore , we may use polling instead . Everything is oki , as you understand about interrupts and polling , you can use it for your own applications , patrick . Do n't confuse with this stuff . Just make your program run first . <p> 3 . Interrupts are used for program debugging . The newer PICs ( PIC16F877 ) have a feature called In-Circuit Debugging ( ICD ) . It is enabled in the configuration fuses . If enabled , your program 's execution can be interrupted at a preset position ( breakpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registers , etc . Documentation can be found the ff . link . <p> 4 . Interrupts can be used for pre-emptive multi-tasking . It is possible to write a short interrupt service routine so that the PIC18 family can switch between several tasks such LCD refresh , serial ports access , keyboard scan , etc . However , it may be simpler and safer to write a round-robin scheduler in the main program loop instead of using interrupts . This may be the only alternative in the older PIC16 family .

Thus you can say the magnitude of the signal is 20dBm or the amplitude is 20V RMS , for example . <p> I would agree yet I am stuck with the institute supplied texts and exams that reference both " magnitude " and " amplitude " in a non-generic way that requires specific value definition but does not provide proper case by case in-context clarity ! <p> By that I mean they do not give an in-context description of what they intend the word to mean , so one is left taking an educated guess . This not the end of the world for me because I understand most inferences , but it 's understandably frustrating for the students ! <p> Now in the lab we use true RMS meters all the time to read more complex waveforms so as to get their effective equivalence . However this is not something that can be done on an exam or when studying texts . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " magnitude " in the context of vectors , but use both " magnitude " and " amplitude " when referencing any number of waveforms including both DC and AC waveforms , and DC offset waveforms ! <p> In fact the institute supplied texts and exams sometimes use the word " magnitude " when simply referring to the meter reading on an AC voltmeter ... is that annoying or what ! <p> Consider that when looking at a scope either " magnitude " or " amplitude " could mean the entire size of the waveform ( Peak to Peak ) , or only the size of the waveform from the horizontal X axis ( Peak ) . Then consider looking at a scope and trying to apply either " magnitude " or " amplitude " to any number of waveforms including both DC and AC waveforms , and DC offset waveforms ! <p> Then consider the number of ways you might define a DC offset square wave in terms of either " magnitude " or " amplitude " ! <p> Further , consider this problem in the context of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grid on an exam paper , and you see it can be a dog 's breakfast ! <p> I was going to say the same thing everyone else did here already i think ... <p> Magnitude and amplitude are more general terms that refer to the size of something , while peak and peak to peak ( and others ) are more specific terms that are more descriptive . For example , we can have the magnitude or the amplitude given in either peak units or peak to peak units , or even rms or average . <p> " The amplitude of the signal was very close to five volts peak to peak " . <p> Magnitude is also a bit more general than amplitude . Magnitude can refer to something that does n't  really have what we might call an amplitude , but then again we might anyway . <p> " The magnitude of the vector was 5 " ( we did n't  actually say what we were talking about yet so it 's a little hard to call it an amplitude yet ) . <p> We can probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 " , but we can not always say , " The amplitude of the vector was 5 " , because it may not be describing an amplitude of something . It would sound a little peculiar to say something like , " The diagonal of the box had an amplitude of 5 " . <p> Last edited : Apr 9 , 2010 77974 @qwx697974 <p> May I suggest that while amplitude refers to the instantaneous voltage at any time , magnitude implies either the maximum amplitude or the area under the curve depending upon context ? Of course , to make things difficult , I have seen articles and books over the years using the two terms exactly reversed and even a few that used them interchangeably in the same article . <p> For the sake of your students , I would stick to amplitude since that appears to be the most popular term recently and define if you are referring to peak , peak to peak , or RMS in any given sentence . <p> I understand the frustration over terminology . As a kid trying to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often frustrated . In my many years of engineering , I 've rarely used those terms , prefering to simpy use " voltage " and " current . " Unfortunately , those terms turn up in places where they should not ! Magnitute describes the measure of a quantity in a complex system , as in " magnitute and phase angle . " Amplitutde is , I think , just another way of saying the same thing . But in systems where the resulting quantity is only real , then magnitute is n't an appropriate way to describe the quantity , despite being technically correct , it 's use can be confusing . Sorry , I do n't have a solution . Text authors should just be mindful or thier use of the terminology . But I 'm happy to hear that at least someone is trying to find a way to clear the fog . <p> Thanks most kindly for the thoughtful responses . I have to wade through a whole series of needlessly florid technical terms and present the results to my students . However magnitude versus amplitude particularly sticks in my craw !

@@71811722 @511722/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Hair Straightener Stopped Working <p> Hey guys . My friend ( who also happens to be a girl ) asked me to fix her straightener , which stopped working . When you turn the power switch on , the LED turns on , but very very dim , and the heating elements do n't  warm up . <p> I opened it up and checked all the usual things ( burnt marks , components that look bad , etc ) but did n't  see anything out of the ordinary . Unfortunately I have no experience with the controller boards for hair straighteners , and I 'm sure that if I call up CHI ( the maker of the iron ) , they wo n't give me the schematics . <p> Has anyone had any experience repairing these things , or could possibly offer some insight as to how the controller board works ? I have attached two photos of the board ( front &amp; back ) . <p> The internal wires are very cheap ( specially the ones wired with the heating element ) . They tend to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I think that the heating element is somehow used to step down the voltage and feed the controller board , I do n't know or if I 'm wrong . Anyway , checking how many volts are feeding the circuit board and the TRIAC would be a good idea <p> PS : I wish you good luck reassembling it , the spring is a nightmare PS2 : Girls ' hardware is damn complex and expensive ! I remember that thing , it included LCD display and a microcontroller <p> Heh , the spring was n't /that/ hard - there are little gaps where the CHI badge snaps in , that you can fit a screwdriver in to maneuver the spring . It also had a neat little oversized bushing that went inside the spring , to hold it in place while you reassemble the other side . <p> I checked continuity on the element that was next to the board , but not the one in the other half of the unit , so I will have to check that . <p> I agree with the PWM/TRIAC part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process of removing all the #$*@'ing epoxy from ) which looks to be the TRIAC , a little SOIC-8 part which I 'd assume is the controller , and a handful of transistors , with some diodes on the back ( for rectification after the TRIAC ) . Hopefully I 'll be able to piece together a schematic over the weekend , that should help a lot too . <p> I 've never repaired a hair straightener before but I think it 's possible that if the triac fails it will conduct continuously causing the themal fuse to blow , so I suggest you test them both and replace if needed . 77972 @qwx697972 77975 @qwx697975 <p> I do believe it 's a thermal fuse , but I tried testing it in-circuit ( do n't  have my soldering equipment with me here , hence waiting till I get home ) and it read 2 ohms , so I assumed it was fine . I plan to properly test it when I have the tools to desolder one leg . <p> I hooked up +5v to the anode , then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the led came on when I connected the gate to the anode , it stayed on when I removed the gate , and it turned off when I unhooked and reconnected the anode . Sounds like its okay to me . <p> If SCR is OK , there are three options left : 1 ) Check the heating element directly 2 ) Give your girlfriend a new hair straightener , as a present 3 ) Convince her that the curls look great ( even if they do n't ) <p> Just tested the two elements , both came up as 83 ohms . Also lifted one leg of the fuse and it tests fine . Unfortunately , the straightener costs well over $200+tax , so I 'm going to pull and test pretty much every component before I deem a new one necessary Totally with you on #3 <p> EDIT put the SCR back and powered up the board , I have 120v after the fuse , but 0.0v on the heating elements .

@@71811723 @511723/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> Recently , our Digital Circuits instructor is throwing yet another project on us to complete this week , and it 's about making a digital clock made out of only pulse generator ( analog circuit using LM555 ) , decade counters ( 74LS90 ) , BCD decoders ( 74LS47 ) , AND Gate ICs ( 74LS08 ) , and 7-segment LEDs . Our instructor intentionally gave us only the second-hand section of the diagram so that we have to use or brains to figure out the rest of the circuit ( the minute-hand and the hour-hand ) . Yeah , it was a challenge to me coz I really got interested in these kind of projects , but I 'm about to give it up already coz I 'm all out of ideas . So far , I got only the " ones " part of the minute-hand section , and I had a really hard time to figure out the " tens " part . If you 're getting confused about what I just said , let me elaborate you about this using an illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74LS90 's , forget the third one . If you copy this part of the circuit twice you 've got two divide by 60 counters . The clock of the third 74LS90 should be connected to the output of the nand gate of the second 74LS90 . Done that you 've got seconds " ones " and " tens " and minutes " ones " and " tens " . The last part is a divide by 24 counter .

A convolution in time is a multiplication in frequency , and probably a multiplication in time is a convolution in frequency , or at least something like that . But with a square wave amplitude modulator , i would think it would just be some sort of ' on/off ' type of operation because 1 times anything is just that thing , and 0 times anything is just zero .

I will let you know how I get on . <p> Each impulse funtion has its own phase factor , or complex coefficient . If phi=0 , then the two constants are equal . If phi=90 degrees , then they are equal in magnitude , and oposite in sign . So , there is really no frequency dependence to the phase factor , but the f/Fc basically encodes a plus and minus sign , if we think of sine and cosine only . I agree it would be simpler to put the negative sign with the left side impluse function , in those cases , or whenever possible .

The transform for sin(wt) has a negative sign on one of the impulses . We can see this using Euler 's relations . <p> 2 cos(x) = exp(jx) + exp(-jx) <p> 2j sin(x) = exp(jx) - exp(-jx) <p> So , what I was saying is that the coefficients of the impulses are always complex conjugates of one another .

All this does is encode the plus and minus sign so that the coefficients are complex conjugates of one another .

Let me write it out trying to use the symbols on this site : -* ( + ( w-w0 ) ++ ( w+w0 ) ) , for cos(wt) ( -/j ) * ( + ( w-w0 ) ++ ( w+w0 ) ) , for sin(wt) <p> which makes it more clear i was stating that there are two impulses . <p> So the Impulse function probably should have been called " Impulses " : Impulses ( w , w0 ) =+ ( w-w0 ) ++ ( w+w0 ) <p> += " curlydelta " <p> and this function creates two impulses one at w0 and one at -w0 . <p> So you see i had understood that there are two impulses , one negative and one positive , but yet one of the transforms has a " j " in the denominator , even though it also has two impulses . <p> So to put it another way , if you were to make a table of transforms of common functions , how would you define the transform of cos(wt) and sin(wt) ? cos(wt)==&gt; sin(wt)==&gt; <p> More to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal for now . <p> My first thought is that the imaginary part comes into play at the end when we need to render the output into real world terms . <p> The confusion about the asterisk comes in because sometimes it is written for example : Aw*Bw <p> where " * " is stated as being " convolution " when really it is just multiplication . True convolution requires the integral even in the frequency domain , so i think what it is is sometimes the notation is overstated . <p> ie : Integral ( xt*h ( t-T ) ) dT=X*H where " * " denotes convolution . <p> The above is not correct because " * " must be multiplication , but sometimes we say " convolve " anyway : " Let us convolve the two functions X and H : X*H " Really when we convolve it should be x*h=X.H where the dot means multiply . If we write X*H where * really means convolve , then we mean : Integral ( X ( w ) . H(w-W) ) dw where again the dot means actual multiplication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx697974 <p> Yes , your meaning was clear to me . The notation you used originally had the issues you mentioned , but still your meaning was clear in the context of the thread . <p> So , when I was commenting on " one of the impulses being negative " , for the case of the sine function . I was not referring to the left or right impluses . Clearly there are two impulses for any phase shifted cosine wave . When I say , positive or negative impulse , I just mean the amplitude is positive or negative . But even that is a bit ambiguous because we are dealing with complex coefficients . But , the difference between the sine and cosine is that if we want to factor out one common phase factor , we need 2 positive impulses for cosine and we need 1 positive and 1 negative impulse for sine , as follows . <p> cos(wt) --&gt; 0.5 ( + + ( w-wo ) + + ( w+wo ) ) <p> sin(wt) --&gt; 0.5 j ( - + ( w-wo ) + + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to say . We can see that we are basically dealing with the Euler relations for sine and cosine . We do n't see the exp(wt) and exp(-wt) parts explicitly because the Fourier transform implies that these sinusoids are there , and the delta functions identify the frequency locations . <p> The other point I wanted to make is that the form is much less confusing if we do n't  try to have a common factor , but instead explicitly write the correct coefficient in front of each impulse , as follows . <p> 2 cos(wt+phi) --&gt; exp ( j phi ) + ( w-wo ) + exp ( -j phi ) + ( w+wo ) <p> In this way we see that the coefficients are always complex conjugates of one another ( complex conjugate is replacing j with -j ) . This ensures that when you reconstruct the time domain signal , you will get a real function . 77964 @qwx697964 <p> I think what you showed is not correct . You did a transform of a single pulse , but your original question said that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a world of difference between the two . A single pulse has a continuous spectrum for the Fourier Transform ( as you showed ) , while the square wave has ( as I mentioned previously ) an infinite number of impulses , where the impulse amplitudes correspond with the Fourier coefficients . <p> Yeah that does not look right at least for the pulse train . For that you would use the form where you integrate from -T/2 to T/2 to get the cn , then 2*pi*sum ( n from -inf to +int ) of cn*curlydelta(w-n*w0) <p> If you can integrate from -T/4 to +T/4 instead of 0 to T/2 i think you get a cleaner transform , if those phase shifted pulses are ok for your application . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> As I am learning along the way , I thought I should first try a single rectangular pulse before considering a periodic square wave . Once I am content I have understood as much as I can re . single pulse , I will look at the periodic square wave . <p> I still think what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although I am still unsure about how the phases are dealt with - I assume simple addition . <p> I think I can understand the result of the convolution in the frequency domain if I consider the Fourier Transform ( FT ) of the carrier , which is a phasor ( amplitude 1/2 and phase phi , at + / - Fc ) similar to a DIRAC DELTA function in the time domain i.e. unit impulse . <p> As we know , if a unit impulse is shifted by To in the time domain and then multiplied by a function f(t) and the result integrated ( area under curve ) , the answer is simply f(To) . I understand it is simply f(To) , because this is equal to the area under the curve at the point To i.e. the limits of the integral are virtually the same , To ? <p> Therefore I would suggest treating the phasor in the frequency domain ( which is shifted by + / - Fc ) in a similar fashion . This will yield the sinc function shifted to + / - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at the attachment . Interesting to note the difference . I presume this can be explained by one of the rules/properties which state a time shift in the time domain is the equivalent of multiplying by an complex exponential in the frequency domain ? <p> Must admit I am feeling proud of myself as I think I have it cracked . 77964 @qwx697964 <p> Yes that is right , a time shift is a multiplication by a complex exponential like e-jwT where T is positive to shift to the right . And yes , integrating on both sides of t=0 makes a cleaner transform . Well done Grasshopper 77974 @qwx697974

@@71811727 @511727/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> A current flow path is provided by wires or other metals and thus form conductors of electricity . The ability of a substance to conduct electric current is termed conductivity . Current can also flow in substances such as liquids , gases , or materials whose composition offers opposition to the flow and limits the amount of current to definite quantities . The unit of electric current is known as the Ampere , named after Andre ' Ampere ( 1775 - 1836 ) the famous French expermenter and scientist . One ampere of current represents the exact quantity of electrons that flows past a given point in one second and is equal to one Coulomb . The symbol for current is the capitol letter I for intensity or the symbol A for ampere . <p> Kirchoff 's Laws : Gustav Kirchhoff ( 1824 - 1887&gt; , The German scientist , formulated two important laws concerning electric circuits . These ar known as Kirchoff 's Lawsand may be stated as follows : <p> The current ( or sum of currents ) flowing into any junction of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of currents ) flowing out of that junction . <p> The power source voltage ( or sum of such voltages ) around any closed circuit is equal to the sum of the voltage drops across the resistances around the same circuit . <p> Conductance All substances do not provide the same degree of conductivity since the number of free electrons present depends on the atomic structure of the substance . Various metals offer different opposition to current flow , with some providing good conductivity and others opposing current flow to a considerable degree . The opposition of a substance to the flow of current is known as Resistance and the unit of measurement for such resistance is termed an OHM , in honor of George Ohm ( 1787 - 1854 ) the German professor who formulated the basic law relating to current flow and resistance known as Ohm 's Law . The symbol for resistance is the capitol letter R and the symbol for ohms is the greek Omega symbol . <p> The measure of how well a substance will permit current flow is known as Conductance . Because conductance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resistance and is therfore equal to the numeral one divided by the value of resistance , as expressed by the formula I/R . Thus , if a particular resistance is 1000 ohms the conductance is one-onethousanth or 0.001 . Because conductance is the opposite of resistance , the unit for conductance is expressed as the word ohm spelled backwards which is MHO . The conductance of the example is 0.001 Mho . A fractional measurement of mho is the micromho . This is one-millionth of a mho . The symbol for mho is or conductance is G. <p> ( just for the benefit of the forum users &lt;feasible diverse levels of acquaintance ) <p> Electrical conductance is the reciprocal of electrical resistance . It is a measure of how easily electricity flows along a certain path through an electrical element . The SI derived unit of conductance is the siemens ( formerly referred to as the reciprocal ohm or mho ) . Oliver Heaviside coined the term in September 1885 . <p> Electrical conductance should not be confused with conduction , which is the mechanism by which charge flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a material . <p> Electrical conductivity or specific conductivity is a measure of a material 's ability to conduct an electric current . When an electrical potential difference is placed across a conductor , its movable charges flow , giving rise to an electric current . The conductivity - is defined as the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength . <p> Electrical conduction is the movement of electrically charged particles through a transmission medium ( electrical conductor ) . The movement can form an electric current in response to an electric field . The underlying mechanism for this movement depends on the material . <p> Conduction in metals and resistors is well described by Ohm 's Law , which states that the current is proportional to the applied electric field . The ease with which current density ( current per area ) j appears in a material is measured by the conductivity.

@@71811731 @511731/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> I think you are making this more complicated than necessary and do n't really need to calculate those values for your project ( unless you 've been told to ) . You are clearly aware that the FET gate exhibits capacitance Cgs . The time taken to charge that capacitance depends on Cgs and on the resistance R of the source of charging current . So to minimise the charge time you must minimise R and/or Cgs . That means selecting a FET with as low a ' Gate charge ' or ' Input capacitance as is practical/cost-effective ( check the FET 's datasheet ) and driving the gate from a low-impedance source ( e.g. the output of an op-amp , or an emitter-follower transistor stage ) . Unless your chosen FET is a so-called ' logic-level ' type a gate voltage of 10V may be needed to switch it on fully . 77973 @qwx697973 <p> So , if you have an idea or a document about how to find back the equation , thank you 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Hi , <p> You 're stuck probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As alec mentioned , the practical significance of this calculation may be limited to theoretical studies rather than application but may be used to some degree anyway so i 'll briefly note what this entails . <p> First , the model looks like a MOSFET with gate drain capacitance Cgd , gate source capacitance Cgs , drive resistance Rdr , and some inductance L in the drain circuit . The analysis takes slightly different forms based on the actual inductance . This somewhat simplified view allows us to examine the action of the device without paying too much attention to other details even though they might be important in a practical circuit . <p> During interval 3 what we have already though if you look at a schematic is an amplifier with feedback . What is happening is the drive voltage is trying to drive Cgs voltage higher and higher but Rdr and of course Cgs prevents that from happening immediately ( exponential ) , but also we get another action as the gate voltage starts to rise because the transistor starts to turn on following the law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage to fall and that causes feedback through Cgd and that causes current to flow in opposition to the driver current through Rdr and that is why we see the flat ' porch ' portion of the gate source voltage . The falling drain source voltage appears across Cgd and as it changes fairly quickly the gate voltage looks somewhat constant so the entire dv/dt acts with Cgd to steal drive current , thus making the gate voltage appear flat for that period . This action effectively makes the gate-to-source capacitance look much larger and is also known as the " Miller Capacitance " . <p> Because this is an amplifier with feedback we have to know a lot of things like the transconductance and the drain inductance so that we can calculate the actual wave shape , which taken as is , will be at least a second order ODE . So we 're talking not simply an exponential , we 're talking exponential and sine and cosine terms as solution . Of course this is entirely possible and doable for sure in the theoretical circuit , but how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look into yourself . <p> International Rectifier used to have an application note that goes into detail about this , it used to be AN-947 , but i do n't  see it on their site .

The phase plot shows the double pole by shifting -180 degrees . 77964 @qwx697964 <p> maybe i make an error in reasoning , i would be glad if u can correct me . <p> thx for ur comment .. i do n't  know for sure if my problem is clear for u my Problem was not to analyse the phase and amplitude curves , i just wanted to derive the phase equation without the computer .. <p> i think outtolunch u used the bode function in matlab but if i plot just the phase equation directly phase=90--arctan ( w/ ( 1-w2 ) ) i get the plot a lil different ( than the real phase like in ur attachment ) which has a pole at 1 and shifts 180- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phaseequation the phase is not equal anymore with the true phase since the arctan function has a pole at 1 . <p> that 's why i said u must add 180- ( shifting y ) in order to get the right phase above w=1 and is only true for 90- to 0- . <p> Of course i could missed something here , ill be glad to be corrected or adviced. 77964 @qwx697964 <p> You apparently know how to proceed yourself ( check accuracy ) so it 's only a hop plus a skip to get to the correct answer for any possible transfer function . <p> The saving grace comes in the form of the two argument inverse tangent function . The two argument itan function , as the name implies , takes two arguments rather than just one like itan(45) . The difference is that the two arg itan function can distinguish between angles such as when imag is negative and real is negative . The single arg itan can not do that because of course a negative divided by a negative is a positive , so it thinks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third . You can probably find the two argument itan ( a , b ) on the web , but if not , just think of the real and imaginary parts as being positive ( take abs() of each ) and figure out the angle yourself by noting the position in the complex plane and figuring how the result of the single argument itan() should be modified . As you probably know , we can form a little table : i , r , Quadrant : ++ First quadrant +- Second quadrant -- Third quadrant -+ Fourth quadrant <p> By using this table , you can correct the angle returned with arctan ( abs ( y/x ) ) . The x and y signs however should come from the complete x and y , which in this case is the real and imaginary : <p> real=w2/ ( w4-w2+1 ) imag= ( w-w3 ) / ( w4-w2+1 ) <p> If we inspect the real part of this solution , we find that it stays positive , but the imag part can swing plus or minus . This means that the solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fourth quadrants ) so the single argument arctan() function will work for this particular function . There are functions that this will not work with however , such as : H(s)=s2/ ( s3+s2+s+1 ) in which case we are forced to either use the two argument itan function or figure out the angle from inspection of the imag and real parts . 77974 @qwx697974

However , in connection with the shown transfer curve ( pass region of a bandpass ) it is clear - because of the maximum flat characteristic - that it is a Butterworth bandpass . Any further question ? <p> I think , the purpose o a filter is to select a certain frequency band - either to let it pass or to provide attenuation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pass band and the stop band region . The selectivity of a filter is high ( low ) in case of a small ( broad ) transition region .

Attenuation in the stopband ( starting at 2 kHz ) at least 40 dB . A filter with the same pass band but with a stop band attenuation of at least 60 dB would have a higher ( better ) selectivity .

The discovery was made in a province called Magnesia , and the ore was given the name Magnetite after its place of discovery .

By testing all the known substances , it has been found that iron and steel are affected very strongly , cobalt and nickel are affected to some extent , while all other materials are only slightly affected . Iron and steel are called magnetic , or ferromagnetic , substances , the prefix " ferro " being taken from the Latin word " ferrum " , which means iron .

Due to irregularities in size , shape and strength , natural magnets have little commercial value . However , when placed in a magnetic field , a piece of steel becomes a magnet .

Ceramic magnets are also used to a wide extent in these instruments . <p> When in contact with a permanent magnet , a piece of iron becomes magnetized as strongly as a piece of steel . However , when the permanent magnet is removed , the iron loses practically all of it 's magnetism . Therefore a piece of iron , especially soft iron , is called a Temporary Magnet . Because they do not occur in a natural state , all forms of magnetized steel and iron are considered as Artificial Magnets . <p> Magnetic Poles When a bar magnet is suspended , it rotates to a generally north and south direction , with the same end always pointing to the north . No matter which way it is pointed , when released , the magnet comes to rest pointing approximately north and south . At each end of the bar magnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration of force is known as a Magnetic Pole . The presence of the poles can be demonstrated by dipping the ends of a magnet into a pile of iron filings , when withdrawn filings cling to each end demonstrating the concentration of force at each end . The poles of a bar magnet are named after the direction in which they point when the magnet is suspended . The end that points northward is the North Pole and the that points south is the South Pole . <p> Magnetic Fields A magnet produces some surprising effects . When placed close to one end of a strong magnet , a small piece of iron actually jumps to reach the magnet . The fact that the iron jumps shows clearly that the magnetic force extends for some distance around the magnet . This area of influence in the space around the magnet is known as the Magnetic Field . The unknown force that causes the field is referred to as the Magnetomotive force ( mmf ) of the magnet . <p> For convenience , a magnetic field is considered as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magnetic Lines . However , the single line of force is seldom considered in analyzing magnetic fields . Instead , it is more common to use the term Magnetic Flux , which refers to the total number of magnetic lines that make up a magnetic field . <p> A simple but effective method of making a magnetic field " visible " is to place a piece of glass over a bar magnet and then sprinkle iron filings on the glass . The glass offers no opposition to the field , even though it is not a good conductor of magnetic lines . Thus , the filings are affected by the field , and align themselves in a pattern like that of the field around the magnet . <p> In addition to providing a convenient means of explaining the action of a magnetic field , the theoretical lines of force also provide a means of measurement . In practicle work , magnetic fields have a comparatively large number of lines and are of all shapes and sizes . Therefore , they usually are described as having a certain number of lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pass through each square centimeter of a surface that is placed squarely across the magnetic field . <p> Because a given number of lines of force may be spread over a large field or compressed into a relatively small field , it is necessary to know both the number of lines that make up the flux and the size of the area through which the lines of force pass . The number of lines passing through a given area is known as the density of the field or the Flux Density . <p> The standard unit of measurement of the number of magnetic lines of force or magnetic flux is the Weber , abbreviated Wb . One weber is equal to 100,000,000 or 10 to the 8th power lines of force . The symbol used to represent magnetic flux is the Greek letter Phi . As previously mentioned , the lines of force passing through a given area is also important . The standard unit of measurement of the lines of force for a given area of the flux density is the Tesla . A tesla is equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 8th power magnetic lines of force passing through an area one meter by one meter . The capitol letter B is often used to represent flux density . <p> Attraction and Repulsion The earlier suspended bar magnet can be used to demonstrate theattraction and repulsion of the magnet . Suspend a bar magnet by a string and end marked N will point to the north . Take another bar magnet with the ends marked N ( north ) and S ( south ) , hold the north end of this magnet near the north end of the suspended magnet and the suspended magnet will move away , place the south end near the north end and they will be attracted to each other . Like magnetic poles Repel ; Unlike magnetic poles Attract <p> Magnetic Induction Certain materials can be magnetized while under the influence of a magnetic field , but lose their magnetism as soon as the field is removed . Materials of this type are temporary magnets , and one of the materials most commonly used in temporary magnets is iron . Ordinary tacks can become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnetic field . A tack placed at the end of a magnet becomes at magnet itself , and another tack placed at the end of it becomes another magnet and a third , each tack with it 's own north and south pole , north connected to south to north to south all down the line of tacks . This process of setting up magnetism in an object that is under the influence of a magnetic field is called Magnetic Induction . If the original magnet is taken away from the first tack , the magnetic poles at the end of each tack disappear , and there is no longer a force to hold them together , the entire string falls apart . <p> The reason for magnetic induction is best explained by the molecular theory . The molecules that make up the tack material are easily turned from a random state of alignment , all the N 's and S 's pointed in random directions , to an organized state of alignment , all the N 's northward of the material and all the S 's southward of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered to be a magnet . However , these molecules turn back to their original state of a random organization as soon as the original magnet is removed . This characteristic distinguishes the temporary magnet from the permanent magnets . In a material such as hardened steel , the molecules require a great deal of force to bring them into alignment , but once this alignment occurs , the steel tends to maintain it 's magnetism indefinitly . <p> Reluctance and Permeability Because most of the molecules of soft iron turn quite easily under the influence of a magnitizing force , the overall effect is quite strong . In some other materials , very few or none of the molecules turn because of the rigid structure of the material . In other materials , the magnetic field for each molecule is quite small , the total magnetic effect is very weak . <p> Although magnetic lines of force pass through all substances under normal conditions , some materials do not carry them as readily as others . This opposition which a substance offers to the passage of magnetic lines is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property of every material . Just as there is no perfect electric conductor , under normal conditions , there is no perfect magnetic conductor . However , soft iron has a very low reluctance and is a good conductor of magnetic lines in comparison with most other materials . Reluctance describes the opposition offered to magnetic lines of force . The term Permeability describes the ease of passage of magnetic lines of force . Thus , a material with a high permeability has a low reluctance , and vice versa . <p> Measurement of permeability are taken with air as the reference . Air has a permeability of one . Iron , for example has a permeability several thousand times that of air . The Greek letter Mu is often used to represent permeability . <p> Magnetic Circuits The paths taken by magnetic lines of force can be thought of in much the same way as the current paths in an electric circuit . In an electric circuit , pressure or voltage overcomes the resistance of the conducting path and sets up a current flow . In a magnetic circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electromotive force ( emf ) , there is a : Magnetomotive Force(mmf) which causes magnetic lines throughout the circuit . <p> The opposition which the magnetic circuit offers to this flux is known as reluctance . Electrically , nearly all materials have different resistance characteristics , some offering little and others offering high opposition to an electric current . However , with the exception of the magnetic metals , most substances offer nearly equal reluctance . Air and some other nonmagnetic materials have high reluctance . <p> To further compare the magnetic circuit with an electric circuit : there is an mmf instead of voltage ; line of force , or flux lines , instead of current ; and reluctance instead of resistance . The relationship between mmf flux and reluctance in the magnetic circuit is very similar to the relation ship between voltage , current and resistance in the electric circuit . Just as current is equal to voltage divided by resistance , flux is equal to magnetomotive force divided by reluctance . <p> Electromagnetism It has been found that an electric current sets up a magnetic field similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known as Electromagnetism and is very important in many devices . A desirable feature of electromagnetism is that it is possible to control the strength and polarity of the magnetic field . When current exists in a coil , the coil has all the magnetic qualities of a permanent magnet and is called an Electromagnet . If this electromagnet is brought near a permanent magnet or another electromagnet , the like and unlike poles react exactly as explained for the permanent magnets . Moreover , an increase of current in the coil increases the strength of the magnetic field , and a decrease of current weakens the field . <p> Ampere-Turns When the number of loops or turns of the coil is increased and the current remains the same , the strength of the magnetic field increases . Each loop or turn of the coil sets up it 's own magnetic field , which unites with the fields of the other loops to produce the field around the entire coil . The more loops , the more magnetic fields unite and reinforce each other and , as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare the magnetic strength of different coils , and to obtain a basis for measuring the magnetomotive force of an electromagnet , the number of turns of wire is multiplied by the number of amperes of current carried by the wire and the result is called Ampere-Turns ( NI ) . The ampere-turn is the unit for measuring the magnetomotive force of a current-carrying coil . In a formula , the magnetomotive force in ampere-turns can be expressed as : <p> Code ( text ) : <p> F = NI F = magnetomotive force in ampere-turns N = number of turns I = current in amperes <p> For example : A coil with 10 turns and a current of 10 amperes has an F of 100 ampere-turns . <p> Effect of an iron core Earlier it was stated that iron and steel have low reluctance and carry magnetic lines of force much more readily than air and certain other materials . To increase the magnetic field of a coil , it is common practice to insert a piece of iron through the center of the coil . This piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctance permits passage of many more magnetic lines of force through it than the surrounding air will carry . It tends to concentrate the coil 's magnetic field . <p> The magnetic behavior of a coil carrying electric current can be summed up in the following three statements : <p> Whenever current is present in a coil of wire , a magnetic field is set up in and around the coil , which then exibits all of the properties of a magnet . <p> The strength of the magnetic field varies with the number of turns and the current . With no current , there is no magnetism . <p> An iron core , placed inside the coil , permits a large increase in the strength of the magnetic field by providing a magnetic circuit with less reluctance than air. /code <p> When applying the second layer of wire to a coil , do I tape down the first coil , bring the wire straight back to the beginning end ? How do I wrap my second layer of wire on the coil and not cancel out the first layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I need the answer . DLS <p> Using the right or left hand rule , you can just wrap it back the other way continuing to wrap wire in the same direciton ( CW or CCW , whatever you were doing the first time ) . <p> So , basically you can wrap it however you want . You can wind it from top to bottom for the 1st layer and then wind the 2nd layer going from bottom to top . Or you can move back to the top and start there for your second layer ( I would n't do this though ) . It does n't matter , as long as they are all wound in the same direction ( CW or CCW ) . <p> I 've never heard of soft and hard magnets . Just hard and soft magnetic field distortions . I woujld think iron is a better magnet than steel because steel has additives in it that do n't contribute to the ferromagnetic domains ( like carbon , silicon , etc ) . <p> One thing I do not get about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous and magnetic is discrete ? Just because iron filling turn around in a particular direction we can not claim that they are all sticking to one line of magnetic flux . <p> Is there an experiment that proves that magnetic field has lines , as opposed to being continuous ? <p> It is a a mistake to believe Magnetic flux to be discrete . It is continous in the same way as an Electric field . However , there are no such thing as magnetic charges ( monopoles ) , only dipoles . This means that the divergence of the magnetic flux is zero . The result of this is that the ' lines ' of magnetic flux have to be continuous ( looping back onto themselves ) . This is why lines of flux are commonly drawn . It is possible to do the same with plotting E fields , but as charges exist lines can stop and start at charges , so it is not as useful .

@@71811739 @511739/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Inductor/transformer size vs frequency ? <p> I 've got a question about inductor size ( in inductance , but also thus physical size , generally ) vs frequency for DC-DC converters and likewise transformer size vs frequency . I know that a faster switching frequency allows you to have smaller inductors and transformers . I do n't know why though--that 's the question . <p> Does the faster frequency allow the components to transfer more power ? Is this due to the non linearity of amount of magnetizing current over the time constant for an LR circuit ? Do practical circuits keep the frequency so that they transfer current only within some time constant of a LR series circuit ? With a fixed frequency , would using less inductance ( when you have an excess ) improve efficiency ? <p> How does reactance fit into this ? With a higher frequency , there is more reactance , thus a decrease in magnetizing current and less power transfer per cycle . Does the increased frequency make up for this ? Is there a point where ( minus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so high that there is very little power transfer ? <p> One point that should be pretty obvious - Then more amount of iron in the core , the more magnetic energy can be saved before the iron core saturates . That will have an effect on frequensis . For low frequensis , a little transformer will saturate faster than a big one ( assume other conditions is similar ) . <p> The reason the core size goes down with higher frequency is because the amount of energy storaged per cycle goes down for same power . More cycles of lower energy per cycle equals equivalent power . <p> The down side of running higher frequency is the input capacitance of MOSFET 's requires more gate drive power . Power for MOSFET gate drive is C x V2 x F , where C is the equivalent input capacitance and V is gate drive voltage of MOSFET . Peak drive current to move capacitance is Qg/risetime , where Qg is the bundled equivalent gate input charge which is combination of Cgs + Cdg x Miller effect . <p> You also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency . The magnetizing inductance is required to be less to account for higher frequency . <p> It 's basically a matter of the magnetizing inductive reactance which is inversely proportional to frequency . You want to keep the magnetizing current low to minimize power loss and avoid saturating the core . The higher the frequency , the lower the required inductance for a given inductive reactance and magnetizing current , thus the smaller the required core and/or number of turns on the windings . <p> Magnetizing current is a normal parasitic byproduct of the transformer inductance and the applied voltage level and frequency . The amount of power that can be transferred through a transformer is usually limited by the transformer winding resistances and is unrelated to the magnetizing current . Thus core size goes up at higher power levels due to larger required wire size , not due to any core limitations .

@@71811742 @511742/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Help ! Conventional Flow Vs Electron Flow <p> I have read many things and tried to understand this many times . At first I think I understand but by the end of the explanation I always end up confused . <p> I understand that , in conventional flow notation , using a + symbol is technically inaccurate as , in physics , electrons are said to have a negative charge . It would be very helpful if you could tell me if I 'm right or wrong about the following : <p> Q : If I have a simple schematic of a DC circuit , using a 9v battery , that is drawn using conventional flow notation would I be correct in assuming the following : <p> - The terminal marked + on the battery connects to the circuit at the point where the + terminal is marked in the schematic . <p> - The actual " real world " direction of flow of the electrons is from the terminal marked + in the schematic and on the battery . To to the terminal marked - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To generalise : In real life , polarized components having terminals marked with + and - symbols indicate that the real world direction of flow of electrons goes from the + terminal to the - terminal . <p> Conventional ( current ) flow is from + to - . It comes from early times when no one knew the charge of the current carriers and so they arbitrarily defined them as being positive . <p> But the current carriers turned out to be electrons , which are negatively charged , and since like charges repel and opposite charges attract , they are attracted to a plus terminal . Thus electrons flow from minus to plus . <p> The polarities are still correct . Electrons ( - charge ) flow from the - terminal of the battery through the circuit to + terminal of the battery . Direction of CurrentElectron Flow <p> When we say " current flows from + to - " , we do NOT mean electron flow . We mean conventional current flow or " hole " flow . Do you know the concept of electrons and holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges come from electrons . But we also know that protons do not flow since the proton is stuck in the nucleus , therefore positive charges do not physically flow . Electrons on the other hand , do flow since they can jump from atom to atom so negative charges can flow . But when the negative charge jumps , it leaves behind a " hole " of positive charge that originates from the proton in the nucleus which no longer has it 's charge cancelled to zero because the electrons is n't there anymore . As the electrons move in one direction and leave behind holes , it will appear as though the holes flow in the opposite direction . This hole flow is conventional current.Hole Flow <p> This is probably the worst legacy issue I hate about electronics , luckily it does n't matter most of the time until you get into semiconductor physics . <p> In reality the electrons are following the blue arrows . Think about it this way , the polarity symbols indicate the type of charge carrier ( an electron or a hole ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they come out of the negative terminal following the blue line . <p> Exactly what the picture says . Perhaps if you put your confusion into words we clear up that particular confusion . I thought the picture was pretty obvious so we must be missing something from your train of thought <p> I think you are confusing the fact that an electron is " something " but has a " negative " charge . Normally we are used to the idea of " something " flowing to an area of " nothing " . In math this intuitively starts out as " positive " to " negative " since positive is more of something than negative . <p> BUt when electronics started out we were n't able to see what was " something " and what was " nothing " so we made an exectuve decision and labelled one positive and one negative without knowing for sure . It turns out we made a mistake and reversed the labels we are normally used to . So " something " which is labelled " negative " flows towards " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and negative are purely mathematical labels , you could reverse everything and the meaning would not change . <p> It 's a bit like knowing that dark and light exist , but not knowing whether empty space is normally dark or light , and whether it was dark beams darkening or light beams lighting . One has to be nothing , one has to be something , but you 're not sure which . If you were sure , you would give " something " the label positive and the " nothing " negative . If you were n't sure but had no choice , you just give randomly give them a label and hope you 're right . We were not right in this case . <p> Did you read the 3 links I sent you ? Or more importantly , look at the animations ? <p> Conventional ( current ) flow is from + to - . It comes from early times when no one knew the charge of the current carriers and so they arbitrarily defined them as being positive . <p> But the current carriers turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since like charges repel and opposite charges attract , they are attracted to a plus terminal . Thus electrons flow from minus to plus . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Thanks . So , if you are building a simple circuit from a schematic in conventional flow notation you would connect polarized components as they are marked on the component and on the chematic. i.e. the terminal marked + on capacitor would connect to the point in the schematic where the + terminal of the capacitor symbol is ? <p> The polarities are still correct . Electrons ( - charge ) flow from the - terminal of the battery through the circuit to + terminal of the battery . Direction of CurrentElectron Flow <p> When we say " current flows from + to - " , we do NOT mean electron flow . We mean conventional current flow or " hole " flow . Do you know the concept of electrons and holes ? We know positive charges come from protons and negative charges come from electrons . But we also know that protons do not flow since the proton is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically flow . Electrons on the other hand , do flow since they can jump from atom to atom so negative charges can flow . But when the negative charge jumps , it leaves behind a " hole " of positive charge that originates from the proton in the nucleus which no longer has it 's charge cancelled to zero because the electrons is n't there anymore . As the electrons move in one direction and leave behind holes , it will appear as though the holes flow in the opposite direction . This hole flow is conventional current.Hole Flow <p> This is probably the worst legacy issue I hate about electronics , luckily it does n't matter most of the time until you get into semiconductor physics . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Oh my god ! Thank you so much ! I think you have just hit the nail on the head and made me see where the flaw in my understanding occurs . The notion of current flow being different from that of electron flow ! I need to investigate this further . <p> You 'll almost never see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physicist . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> So it 's safe to assume that , unless specified otherwise , all schematics are marked in conventional notation and real life polarized components are marked + &amp; - so as to connect those terminals to the points marked with the same + or - in the schematic . <p> I 've heard that we have Ben Franklin to thank for this . You know , he was really amazing and did so many great things in his life . But , apparently he was n't much of a gambler . He had a 50% chance and he got it wrong ! <p> I 'll bet there exists a parallel universe made of antimatter with positrons flowing in conductors . I wonder , did the people there define it the opposite way , and get it wrong too ? <p> EDIT : I have been replying to posts but keep getting a " message will be checked by moderators " message which is making it hard to have a conversation ! <p> dknguyen , this is the 3rd time I 've tried to thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head in the flaw in my understanding . That being the notion of charge flow is not the same as electron flow ! <p> In reality the electrons are following the blue arrows . Think about it this way , the polarity symbols indicate the type of charge carrier ( an electron or a hole ) that originates from the terminal . Electrons are negative , so they come out of the negative terminal following the blue line . <p> Exactly what the picture says . Perhaps if you put your confusion into words we clear up that particular confusion . I thought the picture was pretty obvious so we must be missing something from your train of thought 77968 @qwx697968 <p> My confusion is like this : <p> When I look at a schematic to try and figure out what is going on I imagine a physical flow of electrons running through a circuit from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of a battery . <p> From what you have said I am now getting the idea that this is wrong regarding the flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a more abstract notion of a " charge " flowing from the + to - terminals ? <p> My electronics interest is in guitar amplifiers and effects . When polarized components such as diodes , capacitors , transistors and electron tubes are thrown in to the circuit it just confuses me . <p> For example , if I 'm understanding what your saying then is this correct : <p> If you have a diode in a circuit a " charge " will be flowing from the + to - side but the actual electrons will be flowing from the - to + side ? <p> The polarities are still correct . Electrons ( - charge ) flow from the - terminal of the battery through the circuit to + terminal of the battery .

But that it 's correct to think of a more abstract notion of a " charge " flowing from the + to - terminals ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> No abstract notion is needed if you understand the difference between the appearance of something flowing and the fact that something physically is flowing .

THey provide more details and graphics . <p> electric noob , you have the totally wrong idea of how electron flow occurs at all . It takes minutes , hours , months , even years for a single electron to actually move from one end of a circuit to the other in a metal , and in the case of AC circuits the electrons do n't actually move at all on average , what moves is the energy . Far too often people think of electronics as water flowing from one point to another , which it absolutely is not . It 's energy ( like a wave in water ) traveling from one point to another , with electronics electrons are the media , what is being ' transferred ' is energy . <p> electric noob , you have the totally wrong idea of how electron flow occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even years for a single electron to actually move from one end of a circuit to the other in a metal , and in the case of AC circuits the electrons do n't actually move at all on average , what moves is the energy .

You wo n't believe how much help what you are saying is to me . It 's much appreciated . <p> dknguyen , I think you nailed what the flaw in my understanding is . The notion of " charge " flowing and not electrons flowing . I feel like I 'm on the verge of a personal breakthough in understanding now ! <p> It is not correct physically to think of electrons as flowing from the positive terminal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative terminal because that is not the way it works in reality . It is however correct to think of the ' holes ' as flowing in this way because the hole flow is opposite to the electron flow as shown in the accompanying diagram . The convention of current flowing from positive , through the circuit , and back to the negative has been accepted however not only because it was invented a long time ago but because it simplifies a lot of analysis by eliminating the minus sign ( - ) that would have to be present in a lot of formulas where you could leave it out if you assume ' conventional ' current flow ( positive to negative ) . For example , Ohms Law : R=V/I if we had negative current flow would read : R=V/ ( -I ) , or R=-V/I either of which makes things more difficult . This is also true in other areas such as control theory and design . Using the convention of current flow from positive to negative results in simpler formulas . In physics electron flow results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really depends on what area we are working in . <p> What you are looking for i think is how to relate the various parts you find to the circuits and how they connect together properly , and to understand more about this so that you can look at a schematic and understand how and why the component is connected the way it is , and also to be able to duplicate this yourself with an actual circuit breadboard you build up at home . To do this you really need to take one type of component at a time and look at it carefully , and fully understand it before moving to the next . Start with a resistor , which i 'm sure you know is not polarized , so you can connect it into the circuit either way you want to . A diode however does have a polarity , so you have to be careful how you connect that into a circuit . Well , if you look at the diode you will see that it looks a lot like an arrowhead . The arrowhead points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative ) so that in order to get the diode to conduct you have to connect the anode ( tail of the arrowhead ) to the positive terminal of a battery and the cathode ( tip of the arrowhead ) to the negative terminal of a battery ( though a resistor to limit current ) . The current would then flow from the positive terminal of the battery , to the anode of the diode , through the diode to the cathode , then through the resistor and finally back to the negative terminal of the battery . Again , this is ' conventional ' current flow and is more like what is called ' hole ' flow than actual electron flow , but nonetheless works out in practice when thinking about it in this manner . <p> If we wanted to look at the diode in terms of true electron flow , we would simply start at the negative terminal of the battery , move to the resistor , through the resistor , then to the cathode of the diode and through the diode to the anode , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery . The direction we choose is rather arbitrary unless we are reading material that already assumes a type of current flow , in which case we then are forced to adapt to whatever that author chose to use at the time of writing . It 's a good idea then to know both ways of looking at a circuit . <p> When connecting one circuit to another or a battery to a circuit , usually there is only one convention however . That is to ' match ' up the polarities to one another . Thus , to connect a battery to a circuit that has plus ( + ) and minus ( - ) written or labeled on it , we would connect the positive terminal of the battery to the plus ( + ) and the negative terminal of the battery to the minus ( - ) . <p> How we connect other things depend on how we want to connect them together , such as in series or parallel . You probably need to look at these kinds of basic circuit connections also before anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it from the point of view of an electron or of a hole ... 77964 @qwx697964 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Do n't try and think too hard on this , it will just give you a headache . You should have a concept that something flows in one direction in DC circuits ( the something flows back and forth in AC circuits ! ) , as when you open a switch contact nothing can flow and when you close it flow is possible . <p> In the early days of electricity discoveries they decided by fiat or consensus ( who know for sure ! ) that current flow is from + to - . They did n't at the time have the knowledge of atoms and their structure let alone how current could flow through them , but they did understand that flow would happen when there was a voltage potential difference between conducting nodes . <p> So the scientist of the day said current flows from positive to negative . It 's still taught that way in college engineering schools , but in technical , military and other practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does n't really matter which way one thinks current flows as long as they are consistent with their thinking . <p> The weird part is that the engineering types , not wanting to admit that their original definition of current flow direction was wrong , went and invented ' hole flow ' theory to somehow justify the original error . Sad part is that the engineering types get to define the arrow direction used in drawing semiconductor symbols so that 's why all the arrows point backwards to true electron current flow . <p> This is probably the worst legacy issue I hate about electronics , luckily it does n't matter most of the time until you get into semiconductor physics . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> It also was important ( and still may be for the few people that still use them ) in understanding the operation of a vacuum tube .

@@71811743 @511743/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> The capacitance in air takes the ' relative ' permittivity of free space to be 1 . The capacitance of 2 wires in parallel and using a dielectric is not simple . If the wires are in a screened pair arrangement , then this defines the electric field . If the two wires are part of an unscreened cable , then the dielectric will be part air and part plastic . Because of the higher voltage gradient of the electric field close to the conductor surface , then the plastic insulation will have a major effect even though the amount of insulation is not very much . The relative dielectric constant for polyethylene and PTFE and polypropylene is close to 2.3 . For PVC and other odd materials , the dielectric constant can be MUCH higher due to the use in some of these materials of fillers and plasticisers . These materials are often used in order to improve the mechanical , or fire retardent or oil resistant properties . So , do you have a specific cable in mind ? hope this helps . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluid dielectrics such as water . Assume two basic wires of known length and diameter and distance from each other . In aire they are X1 , water , X2 , etc . <p> What are you actually trying to do ? What you say is clear but I cant get what you are wanting to know . Is it the conductor dielectric you are trying to calculate , or the dielectric constant of the medium in which the wires are immersed ? <p> Curtis , of you run the numbers on this online calc vs the long hand from the equation on wiki , they are different values ! I am curious if there is an issue with one on the using the radius or diameter ? Since I can not see how the online calc is worked , I can not be certain . Just trying to verify this ? Any other place we can gather or verify the equation ? Hard to believe someone would go through the effort to make an online calc and not work it correctly but I guess that is why I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastline . I put the equation in post #2 into a spreadsheet and I get the same result as the online calculator , within reasonable precision . The post#2 equation uses the radius of the wire , the online calculator uses the diameter of the wire . The only thing that is not obvious is that the absolute permittivity entered into the equation in post #2 is not the same as the dielectric constant value entered in the online calculator . The absolute permittivity relates to the dielectric constant as follows : <p> + = +r x +0 <p> where + is the absolute permittivity in Farads/mm ( F/mm ) +r is the dielectric constant ( relative permittivity , unitless ) +0 is 8.8541878176EG15 F/mm ( the permittivity of a vacuum ) <p> using the formula in #2 is interesting but fraught with difficulty . With a pair of insulated wires , the ' effective permittivity ' is a mixture of air and dielectric , and also the effective ' earth radius ' is located at infinity . So , how curtis is dealing with these uncertainties is not clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a confined space so the basic formula will be incorrect because the effective screen diameter is not at infinity . In post#5 I asked about the actual arrangement of your situation , because it is possible that a single coaxial arrangement will be more suitable . I can not understand why , for the information you require , you need to have a pair of conductors . If you wish to measure capacitance of the pair arrangement , you will need a balanced bridge . At some point you will need to make a capacitance measurement and this part of the problem may defeat you . It is for all these reasons that I asked for a bit more info . <p> As far as I see it , there are only two bare , solid , parallel wires immersed in a dielectric substance , all around with no gaps for a considerable distance . The equation should be a pretty good approximation in that case for low frequency excitation . Of course , the reality is that there are numerous considerations in practice that impact the capacitance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you Jim for the reference . I understood the problem to be about capacitance of pair type cable . Your observation indicates it may be different . From the perspective of wire drawing , I can say that the ' characteristics ' of wire drawing solutions are related to the ' soap ' content and that an optical refractive index type of measurement is typically used . We do grape growing and wine making , and we use an optical refractive index measuring gauge which is calibrated in ' degrees Brix ' . This is for measuring sugar concentration in grape juice . I am aware that similar gauges are used for the measurement of the properties of wire drawing solutions . I note from your reference , the use of a pair of wires to measure the lubricant characteristics . It will be interesting to see what comes back .

Now I want to use the analog output of RB0 ( AN12 ) . I do not get the correct digital result on my screen ? See below the code I use . With ANSELH and TRISB I first make the right zettings , then I read Adcin 12 and write this to AN12 . However , the result is a too high digital number ?

I am not MD or professional in any trade , except Red Green . My advice is that it is best to get/wait/trust second opinions ! <p> Silly question , but are AN4 and AN12 defined as words ? If defined as bytes , you will get strange values from a 10 bit A/D reading . You do n't show that part of the code . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input , so why switch it on and off over and over again ? Just define it at the start of the code . If trying to use it as digital then analog at times , external circuits may cause unpredictable readings - not a wise idea . <p> This is the code I use by declaring the variable . As you see I want to use 6 analog inputs . But the AN12 is the RB0 which is also used for the LCD . The fact that one time the ANSELH and TRISB is zet as input and later as an output is with the thought that I can read the analog input and write the value to " DIM an12 as Word " . <p> I 'm actually assume that you could measure the analog input in a snapshot , and show the result on the LCD ! P.S. AN1 up to AN4 are " port A " related in the 16F883 . <p> Today , I first removed all the extra ballast out of the code . This gives a better overview ! I try to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried that with a simple 500 milliseconds ! ( see below ) I am still convinced that it should be able to work , But just do not know where to look for the right answer ? <p> Both anaolg inputs have an equal height of DC voltage in the test , but the result will give an uneven number . AN4 behaves correctly , at 0 volt is the digital number also 0 and when the voltage rises , then the digital number also . AN12 starts with a high number it starts at 0 volts with the number 856 when the voltage rises , then the digital number rises also but not in the same ratio ! <p> ANSELH = %00010000 ' Setting the ANSELH bit high wil make an analog input TRISB = %00000001 ' Setting the TRISB high wil make it set as a analog input WaitMs 500 Adcin 12 , an12 ' read AN12 from port-B and write value to " DIM AN12 AS WORD " ANSELH = %00000000 ' setting the ANSELH bit low so it will be an digital I/O TRISB = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an output <p> Lcdcmdout LcdLine1Pos(5) ' write from position 5 Lcdout #an4 ' just to see on the screen what the digital number is ! <p> Lcdcmdout LcdLine2Pos(5) ' write from position 5 Lcdout #an12 ' just to see on the screen what the digital number is ! <p> it sounds to me that maybe the additional circuitry on pin is pulling things up a bit ... maybe bad ground ? .. r u using scope or meter ? are you grounding meter at the pic ? .. do you get same issues on adc12 if extra circuitry is removed ? <p> I used a equation like this to convert dynamic solar intensity from different panels to percent value for additional factoring ( color shading specifically for me ) : float percent = ( ( ( float ) ( value - Min ) ) / ( ( float ) ( Max-Min ) ) ) ; RED = ( unsigned char ) ( ( float ) R * percent ) <p> Last edited : Jan 22 , 2017 <p> BEWARE OF DOG , My advise is just a guess as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is professional , accurate , smart or will work .

I am not MD or professional in any trade , except Red Green . My advice is that it is best to get/wait/trust second opinions ! <p> Using the same pin for Digital out and Analog in can be set up according to the data sheet , but results can be unpredictable if the digital out is set high ( 5V ) . To quote the datasheet : ( 3.4.1 ) <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital output functions . A pin with TRIS clear and ANSELH set will still operate as a digital output , but the Input mode will be analog . This can cause unexpected behavior when executing read-modify-write instructions on the affected port . " <p> Also , perhaps check the weak pullups , turn them off . Finally , having a voltage divider on a digital out , which is then read as analog may cause some other issue with the digital out not working properly if the voltage divider is set high . If using high resistive values ( 100k ) , this may not be too big an issue . But , if using something like 5k resistors or less , it may be impacting other things . Hard to isolate digital out on a pin with a voltage input from another circuit unless you can switch them in and out . Maybe try with less TRIS changes , just set it as digital out , and use ANSELH to set it as analog input without changing TRIS , see what happens . <p> As I see it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the 5 volts if it overrides the input voltage divider network ( sources up to 25mA ) . If digital out is low , it will sink the incoming voltage source down to a transistor junction level , about 0.6 to 0.8 volts , which will be read by the A/D input . Switching to input mode may give that chance for it to become high impedance , allowing you to read the actual voltage . Not sure what the transition time is for all the circuits connected to that pin . <p> I do n't think you have to keep changing ANSELH , leave it as Analog input - digital out will still work when TRIS is " 0 " . Look at figure 3-9 in datasheet , you can see the A/D input is not impacted by other settings , the pin is fed directly to the A/D converter . Only impact would be a digital " output " . Good luck ... <p> There 's nothing wrong with your code , but the idea wont work . When a pin is defined as analog in , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever voltage there is that you are feeding in . If you have a LCD connected to the analog in pin , then the voltage on that pin will become undefined , as the LCD will try and sink current into that pin as the LCD is looking for an output pin which typically consists of a totem pole output which either will pull up the pin to VCC or pull it down to gnd . You need to physically disconnect the LCD from RB0 when you have it configured as an input . <p> There 's nothing wrong with your code , but the idea wont work .

There is a slim chance the input to the LCD " could " be high impedance as well ( CMOS input maybe ) or maybe not , but that still complicates things . Also , if there is any other circuits externally or internally with the LCD display itself ( such as pullups or pulldowns ) , that would affect the voltage on the RB0 line . Without a total circuit diagram and LCD specs , hard to say how much error there would be . You will not get reliable readings unless you can ensure the data line to the LCD is not affecting the voltage on the RB0 line ( measure it with a good digital voltmeter and see , without the voltage divider for A/D connected ) <p> From experience , I have never had an LCD with inputs that are not very high impedance . The problem ( as stated above ) is most likely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the resistive divider is not much lower impedance then the input ( B0 ) will be skewed towards 5V . <p> You may be suffering from two problems as described above ; ( 1 ) pull ups enabled ( 2 ) input to display affecting the MCU pin . <p> ( 1 ) is easy to fix as already stated- just disable active pull ups in the MCU configuration data base . ( 2 ) connect a CMOS logic ( 4000 series ) gate between the MCU I/O pin and and the input pin on the display . If the I/O pin of the MCU will ever be open circuit , connect a 1M Ohm resistor from the MCU I/O pin to 0V ( ground ) .

I just have offset the brushes so that the rotor is in a magnetic stall and put many hundreds of amps DC through each relative rotor pole using one of my big welder power supplies . 70 volts at 700+ amps should easily put the rotor into full magnetic saturation . <p> This is a Getty 's servo motor that weighs around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several hundreds of amps for short durations without damage . The specs sheets say that at around 350 amps they will demagnetize the magnets so I was wondering what happens at double that current ? <p> My curiosity was if that much power is put against a ceramic magnet that is already half way polarized the right way could it reverse the other half of the polarity as well ? <p> Perhaps I will have to do some experiments with some old speaker magnets first and see if I can force one of them to change polarity and if so what strength can I get out of it afterwords. 77965 @qwx697965 <p> I should have realized they were potted , a lot of motors are . The only method I can think of that has any possibility is chemically dissolving the epoxy , there is a pretty wide variety of epoxies though and the chemicals may be difficult to obtain .

Apparently its rather easy to re polarize ceramic magnets ! <p> I have had no trouble rearranging the poles and number of poles on some old and farily large ceramic speaker magnets , 6 " OD 3/4 " thick , just using my big N42 neodymiums so apparently the brute force method works rather well ! I do n't  have a Gauss meter but the hanging screws test says they are noticeably stronger too ! <p> Given that a good electromagnet can produce magnetic fields far greater than a N42 neodymium I am now rather confident I can re polarize any ceramic magnet if I have enough power . <p> Once again some hands on play time shows theory needs a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . Force the like poles of a ceramic magnet and a neodymium together for a few seconds . Where they touch will reverse the ceramic magnets polarity in that spot . If you use a pair of big neodymiums and move them around while pressing them together on the ceramic magnet from front and back you can make the whole ceramic magnet change its polarity from front to back . <p> By using several neodymium magnets you can put multiple alternating poles around the sides as well and change the ceramic magnet from an axial polarization to an alternating radial polarization . <p> Last edited : Mar 13 , 2010 77965 @qwx697965 <p> Very cool stuff tcm , I 'll have to remember that , does make sense after the fact though since the magnets are getting their strength from the retentivity of the material . The strength of neodymium magnets nowdays is nutty . 77966 @qwx697966 <p> It takes a little practice to get the neodymiums to line up right and put the poles where you actually want them . If they are off to far from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scramble the original polarity and you get strong spots and weak spots of mixed polarity 's on each side of the magnet which makes for a basically weak and nearly useless ceramic magnet . <p> I will have to set up a big electromagnet now and see what I can do with that . Its well worth experimenting with though ! <p> I am rather glad I did n't  take the theoretical advice that just assumed nothing would happen . 77965 @qwx697965 <p> It 's not theoretical advice ; it 's just someone 's personal opinion from their knowledge and experience , no one ever stated otherwise . Theory is tested . DK 's suggestion was based on them being rare earth magnets not ceramic , the rest of us were just basing our responses on conjecture . If you were n't abnormally intelligent you would n't even have the understanding enough to understand what was going on . <p> Just a note , big electromagnets are ... well .. BIG Do n't get carried away as ceramics based on their makeup have a finite ability to store the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably do better on a retentive material than a really big electro magnet might , if the applied pulsed field were that much stronger . 77966 @qwx697966 <p> If you were n't abnormally intelligent you would n't even have the understanding enough to understand what was going on . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Its not very often that ' abnormal ' and ' intelligent ' get used in the same sentence when referring to me ! <p> I have been pondering on the power limits as well being the problem with fairly large permanent magnets and big electromagnets is that the physical parts need to be well secured or stuff goes flying or gets broken easily . I have worked around the big scrap yard magnet cranes enough to know how high powered electromagnets can send any type of magnet flying with considerable force . <p> I can generate insane magnetic flux densities with highly pulsed CD type air core coils but I am aware that at some point the ceramic magnets physically wo n't respond to any additional input . What I am reading is that a slower longer duration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetic structure to re align . The new pole locations sort of have to soak in for several seconds of sorts . <p> Plus as long past experience has taught me unsecured magnets in close proximity to high powered pulsed electromagnetic fields make surprisingly effective scatter guns if not properly secured ! Good thing my neodymiums have rounded edges otherwise I could be needing a few band aids by now . <p> The simple testing I did earlier seems to indicate that getting a newly located pole to have any power does require some degree of precision as to where and how the stronger magnetic field is applied and then removed . Otherwise when I would move to a new spot to make anther pole it would sort of erase or weaken the first one if I did n't move the magnets strait in and out or if I overlap the two pole locations . <p> I have more reading and experimenting to do yet but I have a fairly good idea that simply overpowering the old poles with a much much higher magnetic field for a short period is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnetic structure of the ceramic magnets themselves . The rude crude brute force method looks to be a viable option so far . It may not be the ideal way to re polarize a magnet but it should get me close enough for what I am doing . 77965 @qwx697965 <p> i have never had any experience of a ceramic magnet losing field strength , let alone being able to reverse it , so i stand corrected ... a lot of the information i saw indicated that ceramic magnets are polarized during the formation process . <p> I just tried this with some flexible sticky magnetic tape and some rare earth magnets and it worked perfectly . <p> The magnetic tape is magnetised with four alternating poles across the strip . I cut a piece off , sandwiched it between the two powerful magnets and it became re-polarised with one pole either side of the strip . <p> So all you need to do is expose the magnet to a much stronger field and it will re-magnetise accordingly and there 's no need for any heating . <p> Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetic recording tape or discs so why should it be required for any other material ? <p> Last edited : Mar 14 , 2010 77972 @qwx697972 77975 @qwx697975 <p> I cant say I have ever had any ceramic magnets loose noticeable power either but then its not something I have ever paid much attention to as well . <p> So far with the bit of experimenting I have done there seems to be an obvious relation between the size of the ceramic magnet and the size and strength of the other magnet as to how effective the re polarizing becomes . My little pencil eraser sized neodymiums ca n't put a dent in the old ceramic speaker magnets but the 1/2 " x 1 " and larger N42 neodymiums seem to be able to shift the pole locations around with fair results . That tends to make me think that a powerful enough electromagnet should be able to easily re polarize any size of ceramic magnet and possibly neodymiums too . <p> I never thought about the magnetic recoding media but that would have been an obvious indication that magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 77965 @qwx697965 <p> Going from what little I know about magnetics , all you should need to do is apply a strong enough field to push the material to the other side of its hysteresis loop and the field will suddenly reverse and be just as strong as before , but in the reverse direction . I suppose I could be wrong , but it makes sense to me so I 'll stick with that unless I 'm proven wrong . 77972 @qwx697972 77975 @qwx697975 <p> Come to thing of it , heating is n't required for magnetic recording tape or discs so why should it be required for any other material ? Because not all materials derive their magnetic properties in the same manner . <p> Try to re-polarize those super strong neo magnets . It 's not the same mechanics involved but it 's much like a basic semiconductor diode . You can hit it with .2 volts for a billion years and it 'll never conduct . give it a few extra tenths of volts and it 'll go to being willing ( if not able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only become possible to buy neo magnets of sufficient strength in recent years , at least reasonably .

Thanks in advance ! ! <p> Mean Time Between Failures is often used to describe the expected life of components or systems .

MTBF can be calculated but that is just an average ; some will last longer , others less . I was repairing radios for a local auto dealer , some years ago and all the failures were due to the audio power transistor . It was designed to run so hot that I could not hold my finger on it for more than a few seconds , yet it would last several years .

Night light bulbs are n't exactly power hogs . <p> Try using a remote control , from ANY type of device . With the window of the IR remote pointed directly at the sensor window wait till the lights go out and without triggering it with your hand push a button with the remote , the pulsing from a close up IR remote will definitely set if off IF it 's sensitive to that range . If that works then you have part of the solution , you just need a few IR LED 's and low power timer with a switch , blink the LED 's briefly every 5-10-15 minutes ( whatever keeps the lights from going off ) If you chose the proper timer you could probably use a smaller battery pack that would last months , if wall power is available the typical wasted current of a wallwart will likely be higher than the circuit itself . <p> So , provide some more information and I 'd gladly help with it 's design and construction . <p> Last edited : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensors require motion , a signal that was there before that is not now and then comes back again repeated endlessly .

Dave Van Ess , The PSoC Guy <p> Sceadwian : 1 ) my daughter suggested moving a few books and cutting a hole in the back of the shelf - now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a hole saw guy . 2 ) Regarding reasons : my " extra " bookcase is unauthorized and I do n't want to lose it my making waves - I 'm chair of the Environmental Committee and disabling the auto shutoff and risking the light being left on by housekeeping is politically unacceptable : &gt; ) 3 ) I 'll try the IR LED route , I did n't really consider the wavelength of the LEDs I was testing with . Rather use LEDs so I can just mount a battery powered box on the back of the bookshelf rather than run a cord , use more power , draw more attention to my unauthorized bookshelf : &gt; ) 4 ) even with an incandescent bulb , blinking is not enough with this sensor . It appears to need IR " motion " which seems to be satisfied with two alternating lights . Part of my challenge has been trying to understand the sensor as demonstrated by failure of my early experiments ( mirror to reflect my occasionally moving image , inanimate object waving or fluttering , LEDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> Externet : in manual mode the light stays on forever . We 've actually resorted to this in some of our classrooms , but then folks forget to turn off the lights . The nicer sensors I 've seen in other buildings allow the user to switch to manual mode from a switch on the front " panel " . A pendulum clock with a live mouse attached would probably work , but then I 'd have to change the mouse every few days . <p> I 'll try the IR LED thing and get back to you all if I need any more help ( or sarcasm : &gt; ) thanks ! <p> dpetty ... Think about this for a second ... You 're going to create this elaborate device that will allow the lights to stay on , which in itself requires a switch to stay on ... If you forget to turn the device off when you leave the room the lights are going to stay on anyways , EXACTLY the same as if you 'd forgotten to turn the light switch off .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same effect without all the extra hubbub . Automatic lights do n't make good environmental sense if the people in the rooms ca n't function ! As far as being environmentally responsible consider the wasted time effort and energy that 's already gone into this entire work around plan . I 'm sorry but as a logical person I have to say that the current approach does n't make any kind of sense to me. 77966 @qwx697966 <p> I had a little time to work on this the other day , but have n't made any real progress . Now the challenge of actually making it work is getting to be more important than actually controlling the lights ! I tried using two different remote controls to trigger the sensor , with no luck . Fortunately a light on the sensor blinks when it 's been triggered so I can tell immediately . I also built up a circuit using a LM556 dual timer and a couple Radio Shack 276-0143 " High-Output 5mm Infrared LED " s , trying various LED currents , timing cycles , distances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know the LEDs come on because I can see them when viewed thru my digital camera . There must be something about this sensor that " knows " the difference between a moving warm body and a moving or blinking IR LED . <p> The sensor likely is sensitive to IR much longer in wavelength than the 0.9 micron a typical IR LED generates ( they basically sense heat radiation , such as from a warm human body where the radiation peaks at around 10 microns wavelength ) so it should be sensitive to an incandescent bulb operating at a low voltage ( so the filament is just barely glowing ) . That would also significantly reduce the power consumption of the bulb . I suspect two such alternating bulbs would trigger the sensor or perhaps just one turning on and off . <p> Buy one of those dancing flowers that are powered by solar . I assume if you have motion lights in an office , you have florescent bulbs which will make the flower go back and forth . Place it in front of the motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have the same problem except our motion sensor is on the ceiling with no manual switch at all . I 'm behind a cubicle so the lights turn off on me as well . I 'm going to try the flower idea too . <p> Thanks everyone for your ideas . I gave up on trying to figure out a compact , low-power circuit , although I think blinking two relatively small incandescent bulbs periodically would do the trick . I went with Sceadwian 's suggestion to KISS . Fortunately my book case is actually a 2 shelf unit stacked on top of a 3 shelf unit . Using 12 ft of 2x4 , I built an additional " shelf " to insert between the two units , and by leaving a gap in the books , the sensor can now see me at my desk . Have n't had any problems since . A few of my ' pod-mates ' have had the facilities department replace their motion sensor with an on/off switch . Given the bureacracy , I think my solution saved time and money overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wave at the sensor around the bookcase , the 2x4 rise , and the new view of the sensor through the gap between the books . <p> I see you solved your problem but wanted to post this for people searching for solutions , as I was when I came across this post . I was being driven mad by the motion sensor in the teacher work room at my school . There is a " privacy " wall in between the light switch/sensor and where teachers actually work ... groan ! ! I could have asked for help from maintenance but it probably would never get taken care of or maybe someone would come 2 days before school is out and they would n't be able to change it because of some regulation . So I got my screwdriver out , removed the face plate and found the model number and brand of the switch . It took 30 seconds to find the installation instructions online . I changed the settings and voila , problem solved . I anonymously post-it-ed that the motion sensor had been disabled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you leave the room . Everyone is happier , no fancy devices required .

@@71811752 @511752/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> AA battery max current draw <p> I 'm working on a project that will need to use standard 1.5V batteries to run the power antenna from a car . I want to use AA batteries to do this , but i 'm concerned they will not be able to handle the current draw . <p> Since power antennas run off of 12V car batteries , I will need to have 8 x 1.5V batteries connected in series to achieve that voltage . A standard AA battery is rated about 2400mAh . In theory , that should provide me with 2.4Amps for 1 hour . I only need to run the power antenna for less than a minute though , so capacity should not be an issue . <p> I had trouble finding how much current a power antenna draws , but I believe it 's in the range of 500mA . Since I will have a load on the antenna , it could draw considerably more - maybe 1-2Amps . My concern is the batteries will not be able to handle that much of a current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light on this for me ? <p> 1 ) A " 12V " automotive power is 13.8V most of the time . 2 ) When loaded , alkaline battery voltage is 1.3V within minutes . 3 ) A 2400mAH battery is generally tested for capacity over a 10-hour cycle , such as 240mA for 10 hours . It wo n't be 2400mA for one hour . <p> It 's probably worth a try , and if you do n't get the results you want there are special AAs made for digital cameras and flash units etc . They cost about twice as much . <p> It 's a motor , so likely the voltage can be varied somewhat and it will still work . You might want to test it to see how low a voltage you can get and still have enough pull to get it up and down . <p> Like mentioned , NiMH batteries are the way to go , they will supply current quickly . If you can get away with a lower voltage , there are ' battery packs ' you can buy cheap that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard , but I 'm sure you can get higher if it 's needed . They are already packaged up with a nice connector and everything . <p> EDIT : NiMH have a higher self discharge rate that might be a concern for you . What it means is that they will discharge over time without actually being connected to anything . This might be a problem for you if your application requires that this thing be ready to use at any time . <p> They now have low self discharge NiMH batteries that are supposed to retain &gt;70% of their charge after two years . Sanyo makes them under the Eneloop brand name , and there are three other companies that make them too . <p> The Energizer e2 lithium batteries have extremely low self discharge ( will last 10 years ) and can handle heavy current loads . I think either of these batteries will work well for you . 77964 @qwx697964 <p> Thanks for the suggestions . The discharge curve was very informative . The reason I was considering using standard , nonrechargable alkaline batteries was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a competition that is limited to 1.5V batteries .

Does anybody have a rule of thumb as to how much it 's worth spending on capacitors either on the PV input or the DC-link to improve the efficiency loss in the PV from said ripple ? For example 1000uF/250V are -8/pair from RS ( I do n't buy big caps from Ebay ) and that 's nearly us much as the main transformer ! ! I just get the feeling it 's lot 's of money for little gain ......... opinions and experiences welcome Great forum <p> I usually work hard to keep the RF from getting into the array .

My thought is that if the cap is very small and the voltage moves greatly then it would be hard to hit the max power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . <p> Another way to think about it : If there was no capacitor , during the zero crossing point of the power line , no current will come from the array . Not good . <p> Wild guess : I think you want the current from the array to only have 10% ripple at 100hz . This will keep you around the good point . ( 20% might work to but at some point the power level will drop ) <p> Thanks for the reply 10% is a good stab in the dark ! In an effort to answer the question without buying expensive components that turn out to be not needed I did a series of LTspice simulations today , each one takes 2 hours to run one grid cycle ! but this simulates the PV 's all the way to the grid . <p> Based upon two 72 cell panels in series giving 500W I get the following 120hZ ripple at MPP for different values of DC-link capacitor ( with cost ) 220uF -2.80 6.6% PV power ripple 470uF -5.70 3.6% PV power ripple 940uF -11.40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that models are imperfect but at least it gives me some ideas of scale , hope this assists anyone else pondering the same questions . <p> Insofar as HF ripple this is all dealt with by polypropylene caps of &lt;10uF my boost stage being two phase to reduce ripple ! <p> As an aside I have never seen this figure quoted in commercial GTI 's yet it is effectively an efficiency loss , the average PV power being reduced by half the ripple value . <p> Given you have two 72 cell panels in series you have a nominal output voltage of 72 volts so at a 500 watt output that a nominal current of 7 amps . <p> Given that , my basic estimation would be to use around 250 uF per amp or a 1500 - 2000 uF capacitor bank although depending on line losses and other unknown factors like GTI switching device zero cross dead band and peak current handling characteristics I would say that optimal could be anywhere between 1000 - 7000 uF. 77965 @qwx697965 <p> Thank you so much for sharing your experience , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be connected across the PV output , in my case they are at the 350VDC DC-link level however the CV value or energy stored is pretty much the same as that suggested by yourself .

Once again thankyou for sharing your experience <p> I really like that way of looking at it and would agree entirely with your elegantly simple way of approaching the problem . The only thing I would mention is the relationship between Vdc and Pout , particularly if you consider the steepness of the MPP slope on the right a small change in voltage can make a large change in power and of course this relationship is highly dependent upon insolation level . Hence I went all the complicated and laborious method of making a complete model in LTspice being the only free tool available .

BTW Tony every penny counts for payback time ! <p> p.s . I made an error originally , they are 60 cell panels , hard to count as the corners are not cut off and they have more then the usual buss wires . <p> I would think that this should be handled just like any other cost analysis with associated future projections . Since you have an estimate of the gains and the costs , you should be able to answer the question , " Is it worth it " , with little or no problem . <p> The way it goes is just like anything else , where you purchase a product and it gives you a gain , and that gain is measured in dollars per unit time . You know this so you can project the " break even " point in time , where in the future the new product ( the cap ) pays for itself . Once you get past this point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no maintenance on the product that would have to be factored in also . <p> So if you gain 5 percent efficiency and that results in 5 dollars extra per month and the cap costs 10 dollars , then the cap pays for itself in 2 months . <p> That 's the right way to rationalize the cost benefits . If you have a question on efficiency vs cap size , it is probably best to experiment . Try a reasonably sized cap and see what you get over a couple months , then size up again if it looks promising . <p> I was speaking in terms of dollars ( USD ) but any type of currency would be basically the same . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> You are absolutely right Al , one of the problems I was having was working out the ripple voltage to efficiency reduction ratio and so was asking people who perhaps had experience of GTI 's to give me some clues .

Thank you so much for your lucid contribution <p> Hi tcm , always happy to publish results , I have a blog here on that system .

I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , but let 's do an example . Suppose the RC time constant is 0.01 seconds and vmax = 20 volts . To energize the capacitor to 10 volts takes 0.01 Ln(20/10) = 0.00693147 seconds . To energize further to 2 more volts for a total of 12 volts takes another 0.01 Ln(10/8) = 0.00223144 seconds . Notice that vmax from 10 to 20 volts is 10 volts and the difference from 2 to 10 volts is 8 volts .

That is the basis of some simpler numerical differential equation solvers . <p> For what it is worth I think the following relationship holds too : eb= ( Vm-Vc2 ) / ( Vm-Vc1 ) <p> where b is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't  check this over yet though . <p> Last edited : Nov 4 , 2016 77974 @qwx697974 <p> I 've been doing this for so long i cant remember when i started now .

As you may have guessed this is a favorite hobby horse . <p> The best advice is to use the minimum and the lowest level of maths consistent with achieving a good design .

For small changes in t we get small changes in Vc and also not too big values of dVc/dt so we can do this in a simple RC circuit where the cap is charging up .. <p> and now for dt small we can keep applying this as an estimate so we can calcualte V2 for values of dt that are larger if we apply this several times . <p> For a simple example let 's say RC=2 and Vmax=5 and V1 is 3v to start and choose dt=0.1 seconds , then we have as the first calculation : V2=dt* ( Vmax-V1 ) /RC+V1 V2=0.1* ( 5-3 ) /2+3 V2=0.1*2/2+3=0.1+3=3.1 volts <p> and now replace V1 with V2 and do it again : V2=dt* ( Vmax-V1 ) /RC+V2 V2=0.1* ( 5-3.1 ) /2+3.1 **45;977;TOOLONG volts <p> So after 0.1 seconds we get 3.1v , and after 0.2 seconds we get 3.195 volts as approximates . Compare to the more exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error , the first estimate being the better by some amount . <p> But the exact solution is not that difficult either : Vc2= ( Vm-Vc1 ) * ( 1-e(-t/RC) ) +Vc1 <p> and you see that is not that much different than the formula for the charging when the initial cap voltage is zero volts . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Oh so you just wanted to go at this in a different way then ? That 's cool i guess , whatever you like . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Not that I thought there was anything wrong with the way you aproached it ( like I said , it seemed like the common sense aproach to me ) - it 's more that I wanted to prove that the aproximation I 'd been talking about earlier actually gave the expected results . <p> Not that I thought there was anything wrong with the way you aproached it ( like I said , it seemed like the common sense aproach to me ) - it 's more that I wanted to prove that the aproximation I 'd been talking about earlier actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Well as they say , " It 's all good " <p> Can i ask what motivated you to look for a solution when v2 is close to v1 ? Just wondering why you would want to look for that if you did n't  have anything else planned . <p> Of course then just to add a little you might be interested in ... <p> For the cap we have : dv/dt=i/C <p> and for the resistor we have : v=i*R <p> and since they are in series ' i ' is the same for both and if we call the voltage source E then we have : C*dv/dt=i and i= ( E-vC ) /R <p> and since these are both equal to ' i ' we can equate the two and get : C*dv/dt= ( E-vC ) /R dv/dt= ( E-vC ) /RC <p> and vC here would be Vc1 , but since it is time dependent it would be Vc(t) : dVc(t)/dt= ( E-Vc(t) ) /RC <p> and that is the differential equation for the charging cap ( and RC=R*C ) : Solving that for Vc(t) gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero we have to add an initial voltage generator for the cap so there 's a little more work but not much more . 77974 @qwx697974

As a result of which d air will flow out frm d outlet of cylinder at very high pressure ... this output is then given to a turbine/dynamo which will convert it into electricity .. <p> You can . THe problem is you need to find a natural source of compressed air . Because if you make your own compressed air that takes energy ( and because nothing is 100% efficient it takes more energy to make the compessed air that you can store in it ) . ANd then you run it through your generator which again is not 100% efficient so you lose more energy . <p> You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce the compressed air and use it directly .

Horsepower in its simpler definition is that 's the contionuous power a good sized healthy horse can produce . Scale that to good healthy human and you get 1/10 that or about 75 watts continouous . Remember that 's continuous rate not peak rate ! For a short burst a big healthy athlete can top 1500 watts on one of those generator bikes . I have seen a college football player do it ! but for only a few seconds . I could do around 1200 watts at the time but again short burst . One person did 200 watts for about five minutes , A cyclist and great cardio health too . <p> A person walking without effort is real low , under 10 watts . The only time most people even get close to the 75 watt output is taking the stairs . And how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 calorie is 1.16 watt hours . So a 2000 calorie a day diet means the average person runs on 2320 watt hours of power . Factor in the estimated calorie drain of just being alive is around half of that or more . You have less than 1 kw of mechanical energy to put to work per day . So how many people does it take to equal what your average house uses ? mine is around 1200 kwh a month . 1200/30/24 = 1.6666 kw continuous load . hmm , I would need about 23 very healthy slaves to keep my house going . give them 8 hour shifts and I would need 69 plus support to feed and keep up everything , now I am up around 80 plus !

@@71811762 @511762/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> Generally the maximum temperature refers to the ambient or case temperature of the devices on the board . For operating margin and good board life , you should probably not allow the board temperature to go above about 60-C . <p> Obviously try to provide the lowest temperature possible . I have had half-watt ( high temp ) resistors destroy the fabric of the board in less than 3 months . If you can not hold your finger on the board , it is getting too hot . Many high temp components use the tracks of the board as heatsinks . This is why the board gets charred . <p> They quote 284 F. That is for the board material . If you are talking about the parts on the board they will have various maximum specs . For example a power resistor will be higher than an op amp .

This has various implications depending on the impedances being high or low relative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current transformer and the wall wart have enough leakage to cause a small current to flow right through them both . This of course causes problems . To find out if this is the case , a simple test should help . After you connect things the way you normally did and start seeing the wild behavior , unplug the appliance from the wall . Do not use a switch or power strip switch or wall switch as they can have leakage too . Once unplugged , see if the wild behavior goes away . Note everything else is still connected , but now the appliance power is completely disconnected from the line . If the problem goes awaythen it could be an isolation issue with the current transformer or the wall wart . Obviously you should try another wall wart next . <p> It could also be that the 10k resistors are too high . Lowering them to 1k each might help , but that does use more power from the 5v supply . What this ' fix ' does is forces any leakage to appear to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit , and so might help . <p> It could also be something silly like an open ground connection . If using a plug board get rid of that and solder everything . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Not sure what your current(s) are but I have used these little sensors in dozens of applications . There are a few versions but the CR2550 will turn on down around 3/4 amp AC . They can also be hacked by removing the LED and driving an opto-coupler or fabricate your own opto-coupler using their LED . I have seen them for under $10 USD. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Thanks ron , those are really nice , but costs me $116 just to get them shipped to New Zealand . <p> It could also be that the 10k resistors are too high . Lowering them to 1k each might help , but that does use more power from the 5v supply .

If using a plug board get rid of that and solder everything . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Will give it a try . All components are soldered on but I will check the ground connection again . <p> It seems I will end up spending about $100 for a better sensor in any case , unless I managed to get the one working that I have . If I use a battery the sensor works perfectly fine so it is defo a line noise issue . What is the best way to isolate the current sensor ground from the rest of the DC ground ? may be that will solve the problem ? <p> I would recommend against amplifying the signal from the CT , in most cases , it is n't really nessecary and will introduce unwanted noise . Instead , just adjust the burden resistance to get enough voltage out , so that the full range of the ADC is used . <p> If you 're not worried about true RMS in your measurements , you can couple your CT in a different way . When I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VCC with a rail to rail op amp to make it " microcontroller-safe " . Then took a 20mS ( 1/mainsfreq ) sample with the ADC , collecting the peak value . <p> It worked rather well , I got something around -15 to -20 mA precision over a 30A range . <p> I thought of that but the CT sensor has built in 62 ohm resistor . Anything in parallel will just decrease the resistance . My problem is the grounding I think , as soon as I connect one end of the CT sensor to GND , and measure AC voltage with meter , the value shoots up to 14 to 16 V AC . I will check my ground connection again and see if I can find any issue with that . <p> I think your burden resistor is the source of most your problems . ( 30A/1V ) coupled with a ( 10-bit ? ) ADC wo n't get you the precision you need . <p> Assuming VRef = 5V . <p> ( 30A*5V ) / ( 210-1 ) = 146mA per division <p> Put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reading of only 7 on your ADRES register ( 34mV on your pin ) is equivalent of 1A flowing through your CT . This may be why noise is such a big issue , a 10mV ripple from the power supply will ruin your analogue signal . <p> Is it possible to open the thing up and remove/replace it ? <p> EDIT : If your wire is quite thin , you can loop it around the CT multiple times .. If you manage to get 10 turns , you 've essentially got 10 times more voltage being generated . <p> I must be interpreting the CT spec differently from you . I read " 30A/1V " as meaning " 30A will give a 1V output across the burden resistor " . 77973 @qwx697973 <p> Instead , just adjust the burden resistance to get enough voltage out , so that the full range of the ADC is used . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I did a study with that last month . I found that my CTs saturated with out a resistor . The core can only handle a certain amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.1V for ( 1/60hz ) just fine . It will saturate long before 5V and 8mS . I know that SPICE makes it work because SPICE does not think about core saturation . <p> ChrisCrhis , Please draw a schematic of what you are doing . There is something simple wrong . Include the 3 wires from the CT . <p> I know you cant use a bettery , however try getting the circuit to work on a battery first , then you know its good &amp; you can start to address the noise problems . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I have tried a similar circuit with battery and it works so this circuit will work with battery I know . <p> It seem I just have to bite the bullet and spend some money on a better sensor . But I would like to get to the bottom of this . Most of the projects I find with such sensors monitors more than 10A or so , while my appliance takes only 1.2A , this much small current generates very little voltage and that 's my problem . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Thanks everyone . I will have to wait until weekend to get back at this and investigate further .

So i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also note that the original diagram has the correct currents shown just not the right beta calculated <p> I guess we agree that the gain to the emitter is B1*B2+B1+B2+1 which is verified by your simulation also , but it should not be called ' beta ' because it is really beta+1 when beta is the more correct overall Darlington beta . 77974 @qwx697974

That would probably work well , but the measurement rate would be quite low , especially at low speeds . The ideal situation would be to measure the rotation speed of the motor shafts directly . The problem with that is that the only portion of the shaft that is accessible of the motors is about 0.5 mm long at the back .

You can scavenge quadrature encoders ( LED and Sensor ) and their matching encoder discs from old mechanical ball mice . Two sensors are placed 90 degrees out of the phase ( note two " sensors " /photodiodes are placed in the same physical package ) , which allows you to not only to detection direction ( by seeing what phase leads ) , but also allows for a x4 improvement in resolution as you now have 4 edges to detect in one encoder " click " ( 2 positive going edges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quadrature signals reliably into pulses and direction will add a bit of complexity to your robot mind ... <p> Another thing to consider is something I have seen done in the past .

I do n't know when we need to use DC or AC resistance . Please help . <p> OK , the real deal is you want to look at delta V/ Delta I. e.g. Suppose you built a 1 mA current source and with nearly the same components or say a voltage change , you could make that source output 1.1 mA . <p> So , you will look at the 0.1 mA and the difference in voltage .

Ib also likes to vary a lot with temperature . I 've heard the term " noise gain " , but ca n't put my finger on the concept . <p> There is a standard trick . Say you wanted to measure the input impeadnce ( resistance if you will ) of an audio amplifier . You can inject a signal direct and then use a potentiometer in series and adjust it so the signal is 1/2 of what you had . Now measure the potentiometer . That 's the input resistance of the audio amplifier . <p> You sould do some searching on how x10 scope probes work , In this case your scope is aprox 10 M ohm in parallel with say 22 pf and you have this scope probe with a resistor and a variable cap in it . You adjusting the cap to get a " perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , measure indirectly the actual Z of the scope . <p> Anh , In network analysis , the concept of ' Current source ' and ' Voltage source ' is used . A ' voltage source ' is drawn as a battery as you have shown . However , a current source is shown as you have shown but without the battery . In analysing a network , if it has a voltage source , the sum of all the voltage drops across resistors MUST add up to the source voltage . In analysing a network , if it has a current source , the sum of all the CURRENTS MUST add up to the source current . From an analysis point of view , it does not matter whether the source current or voltage is AC or DC . Of course , to generate a current , one needs to have some kind of voltage supply and I think you are a bit confused by this . The ' Voltage source ' is the ' open circuit output voltage ' of your energy supply ; ie , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short circuit output current ' of your energy supply ; ie , no output voltage . In your drawings , just remove the battery and replace it with a short circuit and then the drawing represents the situation . Practically , if you have a ' voltage source ' , and you place a short circuit on the output , you get an infinite current . If you have a ' current source ' and place an open circuit on the output , you will get an infinite output voltage . KISS is talking about practical things , but I think your question is related to the concepts of network analysis . Hope this helps . <p> In your first circuit , if you connect calculate the ' total resistance ' 1v/1ma you get 1k . So the current source sort of looks like a 1k resistor . But wait , we can say the same thing about the voltage source because that also has 1v and 1ma . So which is it that is the resistor , and which is the source ? <p> Also , if we connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we still have 1v and 1ma for the battery . But now the current source has -1v and 1ma , and the 2k resistor has 2v and 1ma , so that 's 2v across the resistor and -1v across the current source , so now the current source looks like a -1k resistor . So how did the current source go from being a 1k resistor to a -1k resistor ? <p> More exactly , if we connect the voltage source and current source to a circuit containing a few resistors and measure the voltage at some node N and measure 2.3 volts , then if we open circuit the current source and measure that same node and see 1.8 volts and then short the voltage source and reconnect the current source we see that same node measure 0.5 volts , and 1.8+0.5=2.3 volts , the same voltage we get with both sources active . <p> What this means is that the current source acts like an open circuit impedance that has the ability to force a current through the external circuit . <p> So we really have two completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a resistor , and so they are not handled the same way mathematically either . <p> To sum up : 1 . The voltage source acts like a zero impedance. 2 . The current source acts like an infinite impedance . <p> For circuits with sources this also means that the calculations involve other parts of the circuit ( other than the sources ) in order to establish operating conditions . For example , a 2v battery in series with a 1k resistor gives 2ma , but that same battery with a 2k resistor only gives 1ma , which is entirely different because the ' external ' circuit changed . <p> Another view of this is from the most basic circuit analysis idea using Ohm 's Law . We have : I=E/R where I is the current , E is the voltage , R is the resistance . <p> We see we have three different things here : current , resistance , voltage . <p> They are not the same thing and are measured in different units , so we cant call a voltage a resistance for example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thank you , KeepItSimpleStupid , Rumpfy and MrAl for these helps .

By using Thevenin 's theorem , an ideal current source can be converted to an voltage source with infinite voltage , Vth = infinity and a resistor Rth . Rth = Vth/Rth = infinity/I = infinity The resistace Rth = infinity but why you can say that this is the resistance of current source ? I think this is the case if resistance of voltage source is zero . I know it is really zero but assume that you are now do n't know what is the resistance of an ideal voltage source , then can you conclude that the resistance of current source is Rth and it is infinite . Similarly , by using Thevenin 's theorem for an ideal voltage source I can easily see that Rth = 0 ohm but how ca you know that the resistace is the resistance of the voltage source ? <p> The simple answer is to try to construct a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value resistance . If the current source really looks like a high impedance , then we should be able to use a high value resistor and voltage source to construct a current source , at least to some very good approximation . <p> Starting with 1v and 1 ohm , we try to power a 1 ohm resistor with that , and we get 1/2 amp . Then we try to power a DIFFERENT resistor like 2 ohms , but when we do that we see the current goes down to 1/3 amp . So we have a current source with the 1v and 1 ohm , but it 's not that accurate yet . Note that it may actually work in some circuits that do n't  demand great accuracy over a wide range of loads though . <p> So now let 's try a 10v source and 10 ohm resistor . Note we just scaled everything up by 10 . Now we power the 1 ohm resistor and we get 0.91 amps , and we power the 2 ohm resistor and we get 0.83 amps . So we 've improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another 10 times , to 100v and 100 ohms . Now we power the 1 ohm load and we get 0.99 amps , and power the 2 ohm load and get 0.98 amps . So now our two load extremes see current levels that are within 1 percent of each other . Much better than before . <p> One more time we go to 1000v and 1000 ohms , and powering the 1 ohm load we get 0.999 amps and the 2 ohm load we get 0.998 amps , a great improvement over the starting point . <p> So what made the big difference ? The series resistance of the source was higher so with a change of load the current looked almost the same , which is EXACTLY what a current source does . <p> But let 's take this all the way . Each time we scaled up by a factor of 10 we multiplied the voltage source by 10 and also the series resistance by 10 ( that make up the simulated ' current source ' ) , and then to calculate the actual current we divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sum of the series resistance and the load resistance RL . We can state this mathematically as : I=V*n/ ( Rs*n+RL ) <p> where I is the actual current that would be measured , and Rs is the series resistance , and ' n ' is the multiplying factor ( we used 10 each time above but we did it three times so ' n ' would have been 1000 ) . We want to see what would happen if we scaled this up by an infinity scaling factor , so we take the limit of that above as ' n ' goes to positive infinity : limit(I)=limit ( V*n/ ( Rs*n+RL ) ) as n --&gt; +infinity <p> and lo and behold we get : I=V/Rs <p> and note that the load resistance RL has disappeared , which is exactly what happens with a true current source because the load resistance does not change the current at all . So we end up with an ideal current source ! 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Thank you , MrAl . Interesting . The type of current sources you said are originated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of current source is only accurate if RL &lt;&lt;Rs . Are most of current sources in real life created this way ? <p> Some are but most are not created that way . I showed that method because that takes us from a zero impedance device ( voltage source ) and gets us to an infinite impedance device ( current source ) . <p> The idea was that as the Rs resistance increases we see the approximation to a current source get better and better . The higher Rs gets , the more the circuit load RL looks like it is being powered by a current source , and the impedance of a votlage source in series with a resistance ( like Rs ) is equal to Rs alone . <p> We could also look at it from the standpoint of a control circuit similar to what we might find in real life .

And there is a top limit based on how much voltage we apply to actually run the circuit , as if we apply a load resistance which is too high the required constant current might not appear because there 's simply not enough voltage coming in from the power supply to be able to supply that resistor with the controlled current level . For example , if we have a 1ma constant current and we connect a 1k resistor , we see 1v across that resistor , but if we connect a 1Meg resistor we 'd need 1000 volts to get that same 1ma of current .

@@71811780 @511780/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Replacing vehicle alternator warning lamp with LED <p> I 'm sure that this must have been done numerous times in the past , but I 'm darned if I can find any definitive description of how to do it anywhere . As the title suggests , I 'm trying to figure out how to replace an alternator warning lamp with an LED . There are a couple of issues it seems : many ( most ? ) alternators require a field current of some apparently indeterminate value in order to work . I believe this is around an amp , but it may be more . Secondly , the voltage difference can be in either direction - alt high + batt low = battery fault or batt high + alt low = alternator fault . <p> So , giving this some consideration : I 'm thinking that the alternator warning lamp itself could be replaced with a power resistor , about ten ohms or so , to supply the field current ; a bridge rectifier placed across this resistor could maybe feed an led . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm on the verge of some practical experimentation ... but I 've only got one alternator , and my truck needs it ! <p> So does anyone have any pointers to how this might be done , or even better , some actual bona-fide practical experience ? I 'd be very happy to hear it if you have ! <p> The field current bypasses the light , so you should n't need the power resistor . When the alternator fails , the isolation diodes ca n't keep the field at a voltage higher than the battery - so at that point the current runs from the battery runs through the light to the field windings , yes . <p> But when that happens , it does n't matter , because the alternator is dead anyway . <p> Tricky part is determining which way to put it in - it wo n't work backwards . Take the old light out . Switch on the ignition without starting ( not " acc " , but " on " ) . Measure in the lamp socket to ground on each side . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The resistor hooks to the +12V , the cathode of the LED ( and anode of the 1N4004 ) hooks to 0V . <p> To test it , take the belt off so the alternator does n't turn when you start it .

However , I looked into alternator theory prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found was here : <p> This seems to support what I already believed to be the case : specifically , removing the filament lamp will , in many situations , prevent charging because the field coils do n't get enough excitation current . Indeed , in my own experience , this has been the cause of a problem - that is to say I have owned vehicles that stopped charging the battery when this bulb has blown . <p> Now , I know that modern alternators may behave differently as they are ' self exciting ' . Also there are many so-called ' one wire ' alternators that operate in a different manner yet again . But it seems to me that there are still going to be some that will misbehave and I 'm trying to cover all my bases , as it were . <p> So I believe I am still looking for a solution .

If I was that sure in the first place , I would n't have asked for help . It 's a funny thing ; you would have thought that this had been done so many times , it would be a common circuit - but it is n't .

This is because the positive potential could be on either side , depending on the fault condition being presented .... <p> You should always provide 200 mA or more to the warning light connection when the ignition is on and alternator is n't running . <p> The field current comes from the warning light connection , so it gets power from either the warning light or from the alternator windings , via the 3 small diodes . <p> If there is little warning light current , there is little field current , and you can get the situation where the alternator does n't generate even if it spins .

The bridge rectifier is there of course to ensure that current flows in one direction only , so if you want to use a bidirectional led then you wo n't need this any more - just a 40 ohm resistor with the bicolour led across it ( and a suitable series resistor ) . This does run the risk of exceeding the led 's reverse voltage specification , however . <p> Useful info : : <p> Interestingly , I am using high efficiency leds from Rapid Electronics in the UK and there is no ( human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5mA ... in fact , these leds light up when I use myself as a part of the circuit !

@@71811782 @511782/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Problem with RC Car Receiver <p> The range on my RC car has dropped from around 250 feet to less than 20 feet and I can not figure out why . It 's taken a bit of a bashing lately which is probably the cause . To troubleshoot , I have pulled the onboard electronics package including the receiver ( Rx ) and set them up with just the steering servo connected . I set the steering trim on the transmitter ( Tx ) to full lock on one side and powered up the Tx and the Rx . While the Tx is within a foot or two , the servo steers as it should . I then walk the Tx away from the Rx until the servo returns to center ( i.e. the Rx no longer picks up the Tx signal ) . I put the Tx down and return to the bench to fiddle with the Rx to see if I can see something obviously wrong . I have replaced the antenna with no sucess and there are no obvious loose connections or components @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The odd thing is sometimes , if I pick up the antenna , or hold the Rx board in a certain way or sometimes just cup my hands around the Rx , it will start to respond to the Tx properly . Initially I thought I was grounding the board somehow which was helping the Rx . But now I think that my touching the board or somehow getting between the Rx and Tx is modifying the signal so that the Rx is better able to pick it up . The Tx/Rx are AM operating at 49 MHz . <p> Thoughts ? Comments ? <p> p.s. - I have replaced all the batteries with fresh one ( Rx and Tx ) to no avail and I am pretty sure that this is not a Tx problem . <p> If touching the receiver makes it work better , try closing in on the section that improves in perofrmance . I suspect it is the actual receiver section of the board ( the 49MHz ) section . " Home in " by holding a metal screwdiver near the parts and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger near the parts . Try to " home in " on the actual area that improves . <p> Move or twist the board slightly . Tap the board and the parts . Have you touched ( screwed ) the slug in the coil ? This is the only way to go about it , unless you have one of the Field Strength Meters as described in the 27MHz article , ( link above ) . It is very difficult to test for an open cap as they are only a few puff . The fact that the receiver degrades when the antenna is removed , indicates the cap connected to the antenna is ok . But you can connect the antenna directly to the coil to further check this . <p> Cheap RC cars use a very simple Super-regen single transistor radio . It is originally set to the hairy edge of oscillation ( for sensitivity ) and the slightest physical change can dramatically reduce the gain . <p> Audioguru - thanks - I will see if I can learn more about this type of receiver . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coil - if this changes position will it affect the Rx significantly ? <p> Yep - it has a slot for a small screw driver . I have adjusted it in a controlled fashion ( 1/4 turn - check range - repeat ) but it does n't help much . Insetad , as I adjust away from it 's original position the sensitivity gets worse .

Not the entire manual , of course . But in my defense , it 's not very helpful . <p> Sure , it 's chock-full of information . It explains most , if not all , of the dot commands and model parameters . <p> But it does not explain , in simple , clear language , how to use the program . ( And I 'm not just talking about the GUI aspects of the simulator , but the Spice core . ) It does not explain the relationship between model parameters and other circuit specifications . It does not explain why one should or should not use the " uic " option , which as I discovered has a major effect on results . <p> If you know of a good manual , tutorial or other document that explains this stuff ( and which is n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to construct a simple circuit ) , I 'm all ears . I do want to learn how to use this tool properly . <p> Regarding my criticisms of LTspice as pointed out by other respondents , do n't get me wrong ; I 've got nothing against this application ( especially considering that it 's free ! ) . It 's not the software I have problems with : it 's the documentation ( or lack thereof ) . Having been a technical writer in a previous lifetime , I think I know whereof I speak in this regard . <p> I 'm with you . It is n't very intuitive , but it 's neat . Here is a procedure I wrote to get rid of the include statement for a lot of parts . Cecil tells me it wo n't work for some cases and I bet he 's right , but I have added a lot of parts this way . <p> Thanks , Ron ! Very nice . I 've saved that as a PDF for future reference . <p> I actually put some . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creating a " new " folder as you did . <p> I 'm still confused , though , about the exact relationship between subcircuit ( . sub ) files , model ( . mod ) files , and . asy files . It seems that LTspice does n't recognize a part until you create a specific . asy file for it ; is that correct ? In other words , if you import a model for , say , a NPN transistor , it 's not enough to put that file ( . sub or . mod ) into the right folder ; you also have to create a xxxx.asy file for it . <p> And what 's the functional difference between . models and . subckts ? I notice that some op amps are defined as one and some as the other . It seems rather arbitrary , though I 'm sure that 's just because of my ignorance . <p> I have found a few places where one can find lots of Spice models for components ; apparently , there 's a ton of them out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I could be wrong , but if I am someone will correct me . I think . mod and . sub files are the same . The . sub file I look at as the functional parameters of the part . The . asm file is the symbol ( picture ) of the part . The names for a single part must match and be in the same directory so it can find both . <p> I think I 've figured it out . Even if you have a model or a subcircuit ( . mod or . sub ) file , LTspice does n't let you pick the component from its list in the Select Component Symbol dialog until you add an assembly ( . asy ) file for that part . In fact , the title of the dialog ought to be a tip-off : it only displays existing symbols ( assemblies ) . I believe this to be correct , unless told otherwise by someone who knows differently . <p> There are of course lots of differences between models and subcircuits ; however , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function in the program . <p> CZ , perhaps a tutorial such as this would help in your basic understanding of SPICE syntax . There are also numerous books on SPICE , although I am not familiar as to which may be best for your purposes . And there are a number of LTspice tutorialsavailable . Have you looked at any of those ? <p> There are better and easier to use SPICE programs than LTspice but none are free , of course . I 've used Electronic Workbench ( part of Multisim ) for many years and it 's very intuitive and easy to use . <p> But if you want to use a free program such as LTspice , then you have to tolerate it 's quirks and the limited manual/instructions that come with it .

I sometimes get annoyed when for example , the complex arithmetic involved in AC circuits is ignored and instead done in two parts with real numbers ( once for the magnitude , once for the angle ) , but since I can mentally connect the theory and practice , it does n't bother me . Anyways ... <p> My question involved transistors . Specifically , the book discusses using transistors as high-speed switches controlled by a mechanical switch .

That is the reverse leakage through the collector to base junction , especially at elevated temperatures . Having a resistive path to ground prevents the current gain ( + ) of the transistor from amplifying the reverse C-B leakage . If there is no path from base to ground , then all of the leakage gets amplified by + . 77970 @qwx697970 <p> then the transistor will never turn on again until the short is removed . With a resistor then the signal source can drive the resistor and turn on the transistor then the resistor turns off the transistor. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Could I ask you to expand on this ?

Why would a path to ground be prevent this ? I 'm still confused . <p> Some circuits posted here and on other forums actually do omit the base-emitter resistor . These are generally not speed-critical , and are not meant to operate at high temperatures . Either that , or they are the result of sloppy design or ignorance . It makes me feel sorta like I do when I ride in a car without buckling my seat belt . I have designed literally thousands of circuits in my career , and I do n't think I have ever omitted the base-emitter resistor in a common emitter circuit . <p> ...

To turn the transistor off fast . 2 . To keep the transistor from turning back on through it 's collector to base leakage . <p> With 2 above , the resistor keeps the voltage at the base low so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would start to turn the transistor back on again . <p> With 1 above , the resistor ' sweeps ' the charge out of the base region faster than it would if it were left open or instead connected to a much larger resistance . <p> I must say though that even a resistor is not the ideal choice for turning off a bipolar transistor as fast as possible . The best way is a resistor connected to a minus ( negative ) power supply source like for example -5v or so . This causes the charge to leave the base faster and thus turn it off faster than connecting the resistor to ground . Once this action is deemed complete , the resistor can again be connected to ground and this property gives rise to a turn off mechanism sometimes known as " snap off " , and is made with a little circuit to store just enough energy to make this happen and not always require a negative supply . The limiting factor when doing this is the reverse base emitter voltage rating , which unfortunately for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not connect it to very low minus dc sources which would turn it off even faster . <p> There are also biasing techniques that can prevent the transistor from entering saturation , which also speeds up the overall switching speed of the device . <p> Last edited : Sep 24 , 2009 77974 @qwx697974 <p> I actually ran into this problem just a few days ago . We were using an opt-isolator between two PIC 's to send serial data . The opto 's datasheet showed the transistor 's base left floating , so that is what we did in the design . Unfortunately , there was enough EMI from the switcher in the design that it caused the optop to go nuts and turn on ... and it did n't happen until the production boards were potted .

My best guess at the turns ratio is that it will be close to the square root of the ratio of the primary and secondary " AC Impedances " , I calculate ( guess ) the turns ratio as 16:1 . <p> The maximum voltage that the transformer can handle will depend on the insulation on the wires and the way they are wound .

Hundreds of volts will breakdown the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2012 <p> Experience is directly proportional to the value of the equipment ruined . <p> NO ! The voltage ratio is determined by the turns ratio which is the square root of the impedance ratio . The square root of 3000 is 55 times . A 555 powered by a 15V supply has an output of about 13.5V p-p . The output of the 555 should be capacitor-coupled into the transformer to avoid saturating its core . Then the output from the transformer is 743V if it does n't break down . <p> These little transformers are designed for 1000 volts 14 watts . It will work to 3,000 volts . I have used then many times . Your little audio transformers are designed for 20 volts and will work to maybe 400 volts . <p> In the description of retail stun guns like taser gun , they state that it reaches more than 100K volts even 500K volts and yet their size is not huge at all .

The wires can not get close to the core . The bobbin design is key . Magnet wire is not a good insulator . It will hold 500 volts . I have seen it hold off 1kv for a day before it broke down .

@@71811786 @511786/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> No , the referenced circuit is a small-signal amplifier ; you need an RF power amplifier . Besides , the 40Mhz toy operates at a low power in a license-free mode . It is not legal to raise the power level and operate it in that frequency band . To get more range , you will have to spend more money to get a radio-control which has more range ( and operates at different legal frequencies ) . 77970 @qwx697970 <p> Here is a simple antenna amplifier . I would suspect the problem is one of signal to noise so you may not see much improvement , but who knows ?

It takes time , about 1/4 - 1/2 second , for the voltage regulator to respond on a car alternator , because the field winding inductance is so large . <p> If you disconnect the battery when the alternator is putting a lot of current into the battery , there will be a huge voltage surge . That is because the alternator , as Mike says , appears more like a constant current source than a constant voltage source . <p> If the system survives the surge , the voltage regulator will reduce the field current and the alternator will carry on working at 14 V or so .

The inductor has more effect than just a current limiter. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I did n't say it was just a current limiter . Please do n't talk down to me . It 's the OP that asked a specific question . <p> Yes you guys are getting to the main point here and that is that the most important role of the inductor is energy storage , and that energy storage is what allows a buck converter to be called a " true " power converter , whereas a resistive divider ( transistor or not in there ) is not . <p> A true power converter actually converts energy from one form to another and that 's the mechanism that makes it work . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a lower voltage and higher current , similar to how a transformer transforms power . For a 100 percent theoretical system , the power in equals the power out but what changed was the voltage and current , so that makes it a true power converter . <p> Take out the inductor though and what we see is a pulse with modulator ( you can add resistance to reduce current ) but that only means that somewhere there has to be resistance eating up power . It is true that the average current will go down , even the current for each pulse , but the current pulse will still be high enough where any resistance ( necessary resistance to limit current peaks ) eats up power . If you analyze this you find that as you lower the resistance to try to reduce losses , the current peak goes up so you end up loosing a lot of power anyway . <p> So without the inductor your efficiency drops quite a bit except in the case where the output voltage is almost the same as the input voltage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the input voltage then the loss in any resistance starts to equal the loss in a real life buck converter where it can not be exactly 100 percent efficient . With a typical efficiency of 80 percent , this means somewhat small but not insignificant differences between input and output voltages . For example , if you want to drop only 1 volt with an input of 10 volts and output of 9 volts you may never see a buck that can equal the efficiency of just a series resistor , depending on the current requirement . But for 10 volts in and 3.3 volts out for example you 'd never get the efficiency anywhere near as good with anything but a true buck circuit even at 80 percent efficiency . We could look at more specific examples . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> They do make switched-capacitor IC voltage converters without inductors that are reasonably efficient but they are generally low current ( 100mA or less ) and step the voltage in discrete multiples of the input voltage ( unless you add an inefficient linear regulator to the mix ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for developing output voltages that are integer multiples of the input voltage . This includes the negative integers too so for example we could use one for an ' inverter ' that converts say 10v in to -10v out at reasonable efficiency for relatively low current levels . But that works because the voltage differentials that appear across the several series resistances are low . Once the voltage differential becomes significant ( as in a 2:1 buck converter ) the efficiency will drop off . So we might be able to do a 10v to 20v converter , or a 10v to -10v converter , but as soon as we try to do a 10v to 5v converter we see a big drop in efficiency because there is always a relatively large voltage difference between any voltage trying to charge a capacitor and the charging source ( input or another cap ) . Maybe adding pulse width modulation would help , but there 's always going to be that largish voltage differential and along with the current means we loose more power . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> To build a 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in series , and then switching them in parallel to the load. ? You could have two sets of two , and multiplex the two sets so that the load is not disconnected from it 's source . Never tried it , but it should work ... 77970 @qwx697970 <p> Sounds like it could work . We 'll have to try it . This config would require some complex switching , but who cares . At least the voltage differentials would be low . Three in series to three in parallel might give us 1/3 of the output or 3.3v out . The limitation is that they would all have to be the same value and pretty close or else we 'd get some strange results . <p> Last edited : Oct 9 , 2012 77974 @qwx697974

For example , this is the main task of the emitter resistor RE that exist in practically all BJT amplifiers . Example : When RE is not bypassed by a capacitor the gain of a common emitter stage is <p> G=-RC/ ( 1/g+RE ) <p> which can be approximated by the resistor ratio -RC/RE if RE&gt;&gt;1/g ( g is the transconductance g=Ic/Vt ) . <p> hie is not used to calculate the voltage gain of a transistor . It is the input impedance . It is shown on a graph for Fairchild 's 2N3904 little transistor and is about 3.8k ohms when the collector current is 1mA and is about 500 ohms when the collector current is 10mA. hie is affected by the amount of hfe and amount of base current of a transistor . Adding an unbypassed emitter resistor increases the input impedance . <p> The voltage gain is the collector resistance ( in parallel with the load resistance ) divided by the internal emitter resistance ( plus emitter resistor value ) . <p> Hi tsopa , The hie of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a small signal parameter and was of particular interest when the early germanium transistors were developed . Mathematically it is defined as + " Vbe/+ " Ib . The parameter varies depending on the operating point . For an old germanium small signal audio frequency transistor type AC125 operating at a collector current of 2 mA and a Vce of 5 volt , hie is between 1 to 2.5 kohm . For a modern silicon type , hie is around 10 Kohm. hie is affected by the current gain of the device ; as hFE ( DC current gain ) gets larger , the required base current for the same collector current becomes less , so the + " ib part of the calculation becomes smaller and hence hie gets bigger . hie is an AC or a signal value , not a DC value . To measure it , set up a transistor at some operating point . If you use an emitter resistor , then bypass the resistor with a large capacitor . Then supply the base circuit with a small 1000 Hz test signal through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage and the voltage across the base/emitter and use the two values to calculate hie . ie , Vbe = V signal supply/ ( Rs +hie ) . Note that your bias resistors will also affect the measurement so allow for this . The bias resistors will be in parallel with hie . hope this helps .

@@71811799 @511799/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> These are Linear Technology Corporation 's proprietary special function/mixed mode simulation devices . Most of these and their behavior are undocumented as they frequently change with each new set of models available for LTspice . However , here we document some of them because of their general interest . <p> INV , BUF , AND , OR , and XOR are generic idealized behavioral gates . All gates are netlisted with eight terminals . These gates require no external power . Current is sourced or sunk from the complementary outputs , terminals 6 and 7 , and returned through device common , terminal 8 . Terminals 1 through 5 are inputs . Unused inputs and outputs are to be connected to terminal 8 . The digital device compiler recognizes that as a flag that that terminal is not used and removes it from the simulation . This leads to the potentially confusing situation where AND gates act differently when an input is grounded or at zero volts . If ground is the gate 's common , then the grounded input is not at a logic false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reason that these gates are implemented like that is that this allows one device to act as 2- , 3- , 4- or 5- input gates with true , inverted , or complementary output with no simulation speed penalty for unused terminals . That is , the AND device acts as 12 different types of AND gates . The gates default to 0V/1V logic with a logic threshold of .5V , no propagation delay , and a 1Ohm output impedance . Output characteristics are set with these instance parameters : <p> **32;1066;TOOLONG <p> Vhigh-----1------ Logic high level <p> Vlow------0------ Logic low level <p> Trise------0------ Rise time <p> Tfall-----Trise---- Fall time <p> Tau----- 0----- Output RC time constant <p> Cout----- 0-----Output capacitance <p> Rout-----1----- Output impedance <p> Rhigh----- Rout----- Logic high level impedance <p> Rlow----- Rout----- Logic low level impedance <p> Note that not all parameters can be specified on the same instance at the same time , e.g. , the output characteristics are either a slewing rise time or an RC time constant , not both . <p> The propagation delay defaults to zero and is set with instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propagation delay . <p> The input logic threshold defaults to .5* ( Vhigh+Vlow ) but can be set with the instance parameter Ref . The hold time is equal to the propagation delay . <p> The exclusive XOR device has non-standard behavior when more than two inputs are used : The output is true only when exactly one of all inputs is true . Use the associative property of XOR 's with multiple XOR devices to implement an XOR block with more than two inputs . <p> The Schmitt trigger devices have similar output characteristics as the gates . Their trip points are specified with instance parameters Vt and Vh . The low trip point is Vt-Vh and the high trip point is Vt+Vh . <p> The gates and Schmitt trigger devices supply no timestep information to the simulation engine by default . That is , they do n't look when they are about to change state and make sure there 's a timestep close to either side of the state change . The instance parameter tripdt can be set to stipulate a maximum timestep size the simulator takes across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varistor . Its breakdown voltage is set by the voltage between terminals 1 and 2 . Its breakdown impedance is specified with the instance parameter rclamp . See the example schematic . **31;1100;TOOLONG <p> The MODULATE device is a voltage controlled oscillator . See the example schematic . **26;1133;TOOLONG . The instantaneous oscillation frequency is set by the voltage on the FM input . The conversion from voltage to frequency is linear and set by the two instance parameters , mark and space .

If voltage is all you are thinking about . 2 ) At high current the BJT has less voltage across it . Why is the BJT less attractive ? That depends on how you are using it . I think your teacher is looking for the answer that the BJT never really has zero voltage across it , if there is any current flow . <p> As a general rule , we want the vlotage Vds or Vce as low as possible when these transistors are used as a switch , is it correct ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> yes ( maybe ) Usually you want a switch to be " open " or " closed " assuming we are not using the part in the " linear " region . ( not open or closed ) . So low voltage loss is good . There is not a clear winner because you must evaluate where and how the part is to be used . If you will use the part at 10 amps then you need to look at the data sheet and see how it works at 10A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts act different at temperatures . For example at 100C the parts will have different curves . Years ago I designed a device and tested it from -40C to 100C . Two years later some of the devices went to Canada and worked well most of the time . The device would not start up below -40C . It would work but not start up . The problem was the power BJT has low current gain when cold . <p> Life is not simple . <p> Here is a graph for a large BJT . The bottom line is Vce . Current is from 100mA to 10A ( log graph not liner ) Note the base current is held at 1/10 the collector current . So at IC=10A the IB is 1A . <p> You can buy power MOSFETs that have a few milliohms of ON resistance , so the ON conducting voltage of these can be much lower than BJTs up to quite high currents . That 's one of he reasons MOSFETs are used instead of BJTs . <p> Another advantage of MOSFETs is that they require no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a base current of 5 to 10% of the collector current to stay well saturated .

There should be resistance from pins 1-2 but that pair should not have resistance to any other pin . Pins 4,5,6,7,9,10 should meter out fine and have no connection to any other pin . You can not measure any thing on the HV lead . <p> The high voltage output wire has been cut off . You will not be able to access the high voltage ( 40kV ) easily . <p> Your primary is usually the two widely-spaced pins all the way at one end of the horseshoe .

The other pins are different secondaries , and the only way to really check them is to measure them with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I marked the primary . I put a red circle around a pin that is not in your schematic . It probably has something to do with the HV section/ bleeder/focus pot area . Do you need all the outputs ?

Does have a high voltage diode on the HV wire . <p> This Flyback Might also have a Built in Rectifier or Voltage Multiplier . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> The output is definitely rectified , and probably has a built-in multiplier . 77967 @qwx697967 <p> That pin I circled in red is likely the ground end of the high voltage capacitor on the HV output . Some times this pin is connected to ground . I connected it to a capacitor/resistor to ground . It is used to filter the HV and to give ripple information back to the HV regulator . <p> If I had it I would apply 30 volts 32khz across the primary and see what the other leads are doing . That way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not 850V the HV would be low enough that a meter can read . <p> Could the EHT wire have been cut off or could there be a plug and socket connection on the cylindrical part of the moulding at the top left of your picture . Compare it with the point where the wire comes out of the transformer in the picture that ronsimpson posted . ( Post #3 ) Also what is on the end of the red wire ? If it has the type of connector that connects to the CRTs final anode then it is the high voltage output . <p> If you connect a led and 47k resistor to a 50 or 60v power supply you have a continuity tester that operates at 60v , you can then use that to find the ground , put one end on the anode cap , then probe around the pins at the base to find the other end of the winding . The reason for 60v is that the diode rectifier stack in the lopty needs a high voltage to turn on .

Perhaps a diagram would help ? The figure below shows a standard DSB+C modulation scheme . The top signal is the intelligence signal that we start with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier ( DSB+C ) , i.e. standard AM . The third signal down is what the diode detector will do - it simply rectifies the input signal , chopping off the lower half . The final signal at the bottom is what it would look like filtered and DC offset eliminated . Note that it is our original signal back again . <p> The other figure is the same intelligence signal , this time modulated using DSB-SC ( supressed carrier ) . Along the same lines , my simulation shows what would happen if you demodulated using a diode detector again . Note that you get a full wave rectified version of the original signal ! Hardly a satisfactory way of getting the original back .... Therefore , it should be obvious that the carrier is absolutely necessary to get back the original signal using an envelope detector !

Maybe I should ask : why would I choose a 100uF instead of 1000uF ? Maybe if someone could point to a test I could do to see what happens when different values are used . I understand for example that a capacitor can be used to smooth out a wave , but do not see why the farad used would make a difference . Just guessing : maybe it has something to do with the speed that a capacitor will charge ? <p> The farads is a meausre of the capacity . In a smoothing operation , more farads means more smoothing . That 's what was meant by " 10 times better filter " , because a filter is just a smoother . <p> As a simple example , consider a capacitor with " F " farads connected to a current source of 1mA . Then : <p> V(capacitor) = 1/F*1mA*T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current was applied .

Picture a full wave rectifier on an AC of say 60 Hz . The bottoms of the sine wave are inverted and you get a ripple frequency of 120 Hz . Assume that you draw no current from it . Now put a capacitor , really does n't matter the size , it will basically charge to the peak voltage . <p> Now , when you start to draw current from this , the voltage tends to look like a repeating downward ramp .

In reality , positive charges are not involved in capacitors , only the absence of movable negative charges . If you can find a good correct description of how a cap works without spending too much time searching , I would appreciate it . <p> V(capacitor) = 1/F*1mA*T , where T is the time elapsed starting from when the current was applied .

This makes its charge change zero for whatever voltage is applied to the capacitor . Whenever you see or hear of someone " charging " a capacitor , they are charging it with energy , not charge carriers ( free electrons ) . In other words , they are " energizing " the capacitor . Do you understand that ? <p> You first asked what the difference between two capacitors with different capacitance . A capacitor is a electrical energy storage element that stores energy in an electric field . A higher value capacitance is able to store more energy at the same voltage . The ability to store and release energy is handy for many electrical functions including filtering .

During certain steps , there are significant difference in the back emf of the motor while it is moving compared to while it is stopped ; but in other steps , there is no difference ..

Current rises and falls at each step , and without end stops there seems to be nothing to distinguish one step from another .

Other types are rare enough to ignore . When a probe is switched to X10 an internal attenuator reduces the signal seen by the ' scope to one tenth of that at the probe 's tip - what you measure with the ' scope needs multiplying by ten to obtain the correct magnitude . The reason for using a probe is this : - An oscilloscope may have an input impedance of 1 Meg with 47pF in parallel ; this may seem good enough but if you want to look at square waves or high frequencies this capacitance will act as a filter , rounding the corners of transients and reducing the apparent magnitude of high frequencies .

Measure the vertical distance from the reference level to the point to be measured ( the reference level can be rechecked by setting the AC.GND.DC switch again to GND ) . Multiply the distance measured above by the VOLTS/DIV setting and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reference level are positive and negative values respectively . <p> Procedure : 1 Apply the signal to be measured to the INPUT jack . Set the vertical MODE to the channel to be used Set the AC-GND-DC to AC. adjusting VOLTS/DIV and SWEEP TIME/DIV for a normal display . Set the VARIABLE to CAL . 2 Using the VERT POSITION control , adjust the waveform position such that one of the two points falls on a CRT graduation line and that the other is visible on the display screen . 3 Using the HORIZ POSITION control , adjust the second point to coincide with the centre vertical graduation line . 4 Measure the vertical distance between the two points and multiply this by the setting of the VOLTS/DIV control . If a probe is used , further multiply this by the attenuation ratio . <p> ELIMINATION OF UNDESIRED SIGNAL COMPONENTS The ADD feature can be conveniently used to cancel out the effect of an undesired signal component that is superimposed on the signal you wish to observe . <p> Procedure : 1 . Apply the signal containing an undesired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal to the CH 2 INPUT jack . 2 Set-the vertical MODE to CHOP and SOURCE to CH2 Verify that CH2 represents the unwanted signal , with an inverse polarity . The polarity can be reversed by setting CH2 to INV . Set the VERTICAL MODE to ADD , SOURCE to VERT . MODE and CH2 VOLTS/DIV and VARIABLE so that the undesired signal component is cancelled as much as possible . The remaining signal should be the signal you wish to observe alone and free of the unwanted signal <p> TIME MEASUREMENTS This is the procedure for making time measurements between two points on a waveform , the combination of the SWEEP TIME/DIV and the horizontal distance in divisions between the two points is used in the calculation . <p> Procedure : 1 Apply the signal to be measured to the INPUT jack . Set the vertical MODE to the channel to be used Adjust the VOLTS/DIV and SWEEP TIME/DIV for a normal display . Se sure that the VARIABLE control is set to CAL . 2 Using the VERT POSITION control set one of the points to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Use the HORIZ POSITION control to set this point at the intersection of any vertical graduation line . 3 Measure the horizontal distance between the two points . Multiply this by the setting on the SWEEP TIME/DIV control to obtain the time between the two points . If horizontal X 10 MAG is used , multiply this further by 1/10 . <p> For the example , the horizontal distance between the two points is 5.4 divisions . It the SWEEP TIME/DIV is 0.2 ms/div we calculate . <p> Substituting the given values : Time=5.4 ( div ) * O.2 ( ms ) = 1.08 ms <p> FREQUENCY MEASUREMENTS Frequency measurements are made by measuring the period of one cycle of waveform and taking the reciprocal of this time value . <p> Procedure : 1 Set the oscilloscope up to display one cycle of waveform ( one period ) . 2 The frequency is the reciprocal of the period measured . <p> Using the formula : <p> Freq = 1 / period <p> EXAMPLE <p> A period of 1.08 ms is observed and measured . <p> Substituting the given values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The above method relies on measuring the period of exactly one cycle , any errors in this measurement will affect the accuracy of the result . The frequency may also be measured by counting any number of cycles present in a given time period , this effectively divides any measurement error by the number of cycles . 1 . Apply the signal to the INPUT jack . Set the vertical MODE to the channel to be used and adjusting the various controls for a normal display . Set the VARIABLE to CAL . 2 . Count the number of cycles of waveform between a chosen set of vertical graduation lines . Using the horizontal distance between the vertical lines used above and the SWEEP TIME/Div. the time span may be calculated . Multiply the reciprocal of this value by the number of cycles present in the given time span . If " X 10 MAG " is used multiply this number by 10 . Note that errors will occur for displays having only a few cycles . <p> For the example , within 8 divisions there are 9 cycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the given values : <p> Freq = 9 / ( 8 ( div ) * 5 ( us ) ) <p> = 9 / ( 8 * 5 *10-6 ) <p> = 225 kHz <p> PULSE WIDTH MEASUREMENTS Procedure : 1 . Apply the pulse signal to the INPUT jack . Set the vertical MODE to the channel to be used 2 . Use the VOLTS/DIV , VARIABLE and VERT POSITION to adjust the waveform such that the pulse is easily observed and such that the centre pulse width coincides with the centre horizontal line on the CRT screen . 3 . Measure the distance between the intersection of the pulse waveform and the centre horizontal line in divisions . Be sure that the VARIABLE is in the CAL . Multiply this distance by the SWEEP TIME/DIV and by 1/10 if " X 10 MAG " mode is being used . <p> PULSE RISE TIME AND FALLTIME MEASUREMENTS For rise time and fall time measurements the 10% and 90% amplitude points are used as starting and ending reference points . <p> Procedure : 1 . Apply a signal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be used <p> Use the VOLTS/DIV and VARIABLE to adjust the waveform peak-to-peak height to six divisions . 2 Using the VERT POSITION control and the other controls , adjust the display such that the waveform is centred vertically in the display . Set the SWEEP TIME/DIV to as fast a setting as possible consistent with observation or both the 10% and 90% points . Set the VARIABLE to CAL 3 . Use the HORIZ POSITION control to adjust the 10% point to coincide with a vertical graduation line and measure the distance in divisions between the 10% and 90% points on the waveform . Multiply this by the SWEEP TIME/DIV and also by 1/10 , if " X 10 MAG " mode was used . <p> NOTE : Be sure that the correct 10% and 90% lines are used . For such measurements the 0 , 10 , 90 and 100% points are marked on the CRT screen . <p> For the example , the horizontal distance is 4.0 divisions , The SWEEP TIME /DIV is 2 us . <p> Substituting the given values : Rise time =3.0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us <p> TIME DIFFERENCE MEASUREMENTS <p> This procedure is useful in measurement of time differences between two signals that are synchronised to one another but skewed in time . <p> Procedure : 1 . Apply the two signals to CH1 and CH2 INPUT jacks . Set the vertical MODE to either ALT or CHOP mode . Generally for low frequency signals CHOP is chosen with ALT used for high frequency signals . 2 . Select the faster of the two signals as the SOURCE and use the VOLTS/DIV and SWEEP TIME/DIV to obtain an easily observed delay . Set the VARIABLE to CAL . 3 . Using the VERT POSITION control to set the waveform to the centre of the CRT display , adjust the HORIZ POSITION control to make the reference signal coincident with a vertical graduation line . 4 . Measure the horizontal distance between the two signals and multiply this distance in divisions by the SWEEP TIME/DIV setting . If " X 10 MAG " is being used multiply this again by 1/10 . <p> For the example , the horizontal distance measured is 4.2 divisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given values : Time = 4.2 ( div ) * 0.2 ( ms ) = 0.84 ms <p> PHASE DIFFERENCE MEASUREMENTS <p> This procedure is useful in measuring the phase difference of signals with the same frequency <p> Procedure ; 1 . Apply the two signals to the CH1 and CH2 INPUT jacks , setting the vertical MODE to either CHOP or ALT mode . 2 . Set the SOURCE to the signal that leads in phase and use the VOLTS/DIV to adjust the signals such that they are equal in amplitude . Adjust the other controls for a normal display . 3 . Use the SWEEP TIME/DIV and VARIABLE to adjust the display such that one cycle of the signals occupies 8 divisions of horizontal display Use the VERT POSITION to bring the signals to the centre of the screen . Having set up the display as above , one division now represents 45 degrees of phase . 4 . Measure the horizontal distance between corresponding points on the two waveforms <p> The above set-up allows 45 degrees per division but if more accuracy is required the SWEEP TME/DIV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if necessary the trigger level can be readjusted . <p> For this type of operation , the relationship of one division to 45 degrees no longer holds . Phase difference is defined by the formula as follows . <p> Another simple method of obtaining more accuracy quickly is to simply use " X 10 MAG " for a scale of 4.5 degrees/div . <p> RELATIVE MEASUREMENT If the frequency and amplitude of some reference signal is known , an unknown waveform 's level and frequency may be measured without use of the VOLTS/DIV or SWEEP TIME/DIV for calibration . The measurement is made in units relative to the reference signal . <p> Procedure 1 . Apply the reference signal to the INPUT jack and adjust the display for a normal waveform display . Adjust the VOLTS/DIV and VARIABLE so that the signal coincides with the CRT face 's graduation lines . After adjusting , be sure not to disturb the setting of the VARIABLE control . <p> 2 . The vertical calibration coefficient is now the reference signal 's amplitude in volts divided by the product of the vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Remove the reference signal and apply the unknown signal to the INPUT jack , using the VOLTS/DIV control to adjust the display for easy observation . Measure the amplitude of the displayed waveform and use the following relationship to calculate the actual amplitude of the unknown waveform . <p> Procedure : 1 . Apply the reference signal to the INPUT jack , using the VOLTS/DIV and VARIABLE to obtain an easily observed waveform display . Using the SWEEP TIME/DIV and VARIABLE adjust one cycle of the reference signal to occupy a fixed number of screen divisions accurately . After this is done be sure not to disturb the setting of the VARIABLE control . 2 . The Sweep ( horizontal ) calibration coefficient is then the period of the reference signal divided by the product of the number of divisions used in step 1 for set-up of the reference and the setting of the SWEEP TIME/DIV control . <p> 3 . Remove the reference signal and input the unknown signal , adjusting the SWEEP TIME/DIV control for easy observation . Measure the width of one cycle in divisions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> PHASE SHIFT MEASUREMENT A method of phase measurement requires calculations based on the Lissajous patterns obtained using X-Y operations . Distortion due to non-linear amplification also can be displayed <p> A sine wave input is applied to the audio circuit being tested . The same sine wave input is applied to the vertical input of the oscilloscope , and the output of the tested circuit is applied to the horizontal input of the oscilloscope . The amount of phase difference between the two signals can be calculated from the resulting display . To make phase measurements , use the following procedure . 1 . Using an audio signal generator with a pure sinusoidal signal , apply a sine wave signal of the desired frequency to the audio network being tested . 2 . Set the signal generator output for the normal operating level of the circuit being tested . If desired , the circuit 's output may be observed on the oscilloscope ( if the test circuit is overdriven then the sine wave display on the oscilloscope is clipped and the signal level must be reduced ) . 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test circuit . 4 . Select X-Y operation by placing the TRIG MODE switch in the X-Y position . 5 . Connect the channel 1 probe to the input of the test Circuit . ( The input and output test connections to the vertical and horizontal oscilloscope inputs may be reversed. ) 6 . Adjust the channel 1 and 2 gain controls for a suitable image size . Some typical results are shown in Fig 12 . If the two signals are in phase , the oscilloscope trace is a straight diagonal line . If the vertical and horizontal gains are properly adjusted , this line is at an angle of 45 degrees . A 90-degree phase shift produces a circular oscilloscope pattern . Phase shift of less or more than 90 degrees produces an elliptical oscilloscope pattern . The amount of phase shift can be calculated from the oscilloscope trace as shown in Fig 13 <p> EXAMPLE <p> One of the sine waves ( the Major ) has an amplitude of 6 divisions , the other ( the Minor ) is measured as 4.8 squares . <p> Substituting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . . . . . Major <p> Therefore Theta = Asn Minor Major <p> = ArcSin 4.8 6 <p> = 53.1 Degrees <p> Where Theta is phase angle in degrees . <p> FREQUENCY MEASUREMENT 1 Connect the sine wave of known frequency to the channel 2 INPUT jack of the oscilloscope and select X-Y operation . This provides external horizontal input . 2 . Connect the vertical input probe ( CH1 INPUT ) to the unknown frequency . 3 . Adjust the channel 1 and 2 size controls for convenient , easy-to-read size of display . 4 . The resulting pattern , a Lissajous figure , shows the ratio between the two frequencies . Some typical results are shown in Fig 12 . <p> E&amp;OE . The list of methods goes on but this should be more than enough for most users .

Neither is safe under ALL circumstances ! . <p> With a hot chassis , always plug the hot chassis item into an isolation transformer . Then you are free to connect an oscilloscope or VTVM ( both are typically referenced to earth ground ) to the chassis without fear of destroying something . <p> You can buy isolation transformers or you can make your own by putting two identical transformers of decent power capability back to back . For instance , if you have a couple of identical " filament transformers " capable of 6.3 volts at 20 amps , you can connect the two 6.3v secondaries together , plug one transformer into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second transformer as an isolated secondary with the same voltage as the mains . In this case , you 'll be capable of handling equipment up to around 120 watts .

Dean <p> After giving it some thought , it might not be a good idea to leave an isolation transformer on the scope permanently . I could put a note on my probe to remind me to use it . This seems like a common enough problem that there should be a solution .

This is fairly important because the impulse response is used to characterize the response of a system . Once you know the impulse response , you can then use that to calculate the output with various inputs . For your X(n) and H(n) since you know what H(n) is you can convolve it with X(n) and that gives you the output of the network H(n) that results from using X(n) as the input . If you use a different sequence X(n) then you get a different output .

For this example R=1 and C=1 , and the sample time T=1 also . Since the digital filter transfer function therefore was already available , an impulse ( more appropriately called ' unit sample ' ) was used as the excitation and the resulting output sequence recorded . Since that output sequence represents the impulse response , that impulse response was then convolved with an input step wave and the output sequence recorded . The continuous time response could then be compared to the discrete time response . <p> The result of the continuous time response and the result of the digital response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attachment . The blue plot is the continuous time response and the red dots are the digital response points obtained as the output from a sequence of all ones convolved with the impulse response obtained from the digital transfer function . <p> As we can see from a quick inspection of the two plots , the digital response is not exactly the same but it does act in a similar manner . <p> The impulse response ( more appropriately called the ' unit sample response ' ) was recorded for 10 points and were the following values : 0.3333333333 0.4444444444 0.1481481481 0.04938271605 0.01646090535 0.00548696845 0.001828989483 0.0006096631611 0.0002032210537 6.774035123e-005 <p> The above could be used as the impulse response and coded into the micro controller memory . 77964 @qwx697964 77974 @qwx697974 <p> ( I think ) The graph is representing the output waveform when unit step is input while it takes some time to reach its peak value ( i.e. logic 1 ) one more thing , Is impulse mean like we use AND gate and have input to one side A and sampling pulse at B of AND gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as per fig. impulse mean discrete amplitude of sigmnal at time period of 1sec .. ? ? <p> The above could be used as the impulse response and coded into the micro controller memory . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> That mean we first need to enter impulse in uC , can we get this impulse response seen in oscilloscope or simulation software ( MATLAB ) <p> The graph is showing a regular RC network with a step input , and the sampled data filter output ( red dots ) with step input after we found the ' unit sample ' from using the bilinear transform on the continuous time system . See below for more on this . <p> Which brings us to some small terminology difference ... we should be calling the digital response the ' unit sample ' response rather than the impulse response as that 's more correct . You can find the response of your digital filter by using a unit sample input and recording h(h) , the output . The unit sample is applied at t=0 . <p> Really we refer to the values as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given height , and are usually drawn as dots at the required place with a line that extends from the dot down to zero . So they look like little lolly pops They are defined only for that sample time . <p> If you wanted to see the unit sample response ( to be coded in uC ) on the scope , you could input a unit sample at t=0 and watch output on the scope . It will go though various transitions and usually the sample will last the whole time period rather than for just one instant so keep that in mind . <p> To see the impulse response of a continuous time system , you could use a step input and a fast , scaled differentiator on the output . For example an op amp differentiator with time constant 1ms would be scaled 1000 to 1 . This assumes a linear transfer function . <p> More on the digital low pass filter example ... <p> Note that the output can be obtained by adding successive values of the unit sample response . This gives rise to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that we apply a step input to the low pass filter , sample it 's outputs at several sampling intervals , and use the difference between samples as our unit sample response . Interestingly , when we do it this way and we convolve it with a step input we get the exact output as we would from the continuous time system except the output is a set of samples instead of a continuous wave . The values at the sample instants however are exactly the same as the continuous time system assuming no finite register length truncation . <p> Last edited : Nov 6 , 2011 77974 @qwx697974 <p> I am still confuse with the use of H(n) impulse response with x(n) sample value .... <p> See we have sin wave in analog form we convert into digital by sampling the output value will be like this : - 0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 .......... like this the 5V is maximum . we store this in PROM and a addr counter connected to PROM will give output in digital for will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where comes the use of impulse response in this . <p> Using a table like that is not exactly the same as using an impulse response to get an output . All that is is a lookup table , where the values are stored in tabular form and the next value that is looked up is simply directed to the output . That 's not the same as when using an impulse response as the following will show . <p> That 's a table of values for sine where the peak is 10 volts . To get the next output , we simply step to the next counter value and read the table value and direct that to the output . That 's not exactly the same as when we use an impulse response , although we could make it into one . <p> Look strange ? It might look strange , but if we use a step input for x(n) guess what we get as output ? x(n)*h(n)= 0 , 5 , 9 , 10 , 9 , 5 , 0 , -5 , -9 , -10 , -9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So with the lookup table we simply look up values and direct them to the output , and there does n't  have to be any input . When using the impulse response , we have to convolve it with the input in order to get the output . The impulse response ( or better called " unit sample response " here ) could be that of a filter so that the output ends up being the input signal filtered in some way . <p> Last edited : Nov 10 , 2011 77974 @qwx697974 
@@71811814 @511814/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Power Window Relay Setup <p> Hello All , I am a new member to this organization . I am excited about learning and contributing . Right now I have an automotive electrical problem I have been dealing with for the last month or so . I need some help . I have spent many hours trying to figure this out myself . Here is a description of the problem along with some important attachments . <p> I am trying to implement what I understand is a common power window relay setup in my 1987 XJS Hess &amp; Eisenhardt Convertible . I have tried using two switches , a 5 pinch switch that was called a dpdt switch although I am not sure it is one and a 6 pin dtdp switch . Below are the wiring diagrams for the relay setup and the two switches . <p> If I apply positive and negative 12 volts to the wires going directly to the motors , all of the windows move up and down providing I reverse the positive and negative wires . <p> The driver window worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now when I hook up that same switch , the window does nothing . I tried installing a new circuit breaker , thinking that may be the problem , but nothing changed . I thought the 6 pin dpdt switch would solve all of my problems but none of the windows move at all using this switch . <p> I have double checked my wiring to insure that I have the wires connected as is set forth in the diagram , a diagram that was prepared by someone else , a diagram that I have seen several times set forth by different authors as the way to set up a power window relay system . <p> I suspect there is a way to troubleshoot this system . Unfortunately , I do not know how . <p> So , if you can make some suggestions , provide counsel , advice and/or guidance , I would greatly appreciate it . <p> It appears that the switches are not rated for the current that the motor requires to start and run , so all of the actual motor switching has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch does is apply power to an up-relay coil , or a down-relay coils ? <p> So far , so good ? <p> Next , we need to determine what happens when the motor reaches the ends of travel . Is there a limit switch when the window arrives at the stops , or does the motor just stall ? <p> Finally , are you up to following an electrical schematic , or do you need to be fed a picture , showing every physical wire you would have to connect ? 77970 @qwx697970 <p> Hey Mike , Good to see you on this forum . You always provide good feedback on the other forum . This circuit and most in the automotive industry do not have limit switches and rely mostly on the fact that when you reach the limit , you will let go of the button . After that , the motor will have a thermal limiter or current limiter ( circuit breaker ) built into the unit but rarely dos it ever get to that point . This is an odd setup as most control power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this setup will work as well . Let 's see if we can get the OP fixed up on this . <p> Hi Mike and bwilliams . Thanks for responding to my posting . Please forgive my ignorance , but am I the " OP " ? If so , I am much appreciative that I am going to get your help on this . I can not figure this one out . Please advise and counsel , and I will gladly follow through . Look forward to your next posts . <p> To answer your question Mike , I usually am able to follow an electrical diagram . I followed the one that I attached to my posting . <p> The second switch ( 6 terminals ) switch can be called : A DPDT center-off switch ( DPDT= Double pole , double throw ) It can also be descibed as a DPDT on-off-on switch . <p> The crossed outer contacts is representative of a reversing switch . The center terminals are the common contacts . So , in the center , there should be no power . In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , the DC has reversed polarity . <p> Voltmeter tests such as : 1 . No voltage out in the center position 2 . Voltage out in one position 3 . The polarity reversed in the other . <p> With the DPDT switch , the terminals that are closed are opposite the handle , so it 's like follow the handle to the back of the switch . <p> Without power , you can check resistances . <p> When you have a load of some sort , you can check for voltage across the switch . Interpreting that and measuring correctly might be difficult for the novice . <p> The old Jags ( and many others ) , like yours , originally had switches only ( no relays ) to operate their electric window regulators . These frequently suffered from overloading ( as noted by MikeMI , above ) that resulted in damage to the switches . They did work OK , though , just not as long as what we 'd expect these days . <p> Do you have and can you use a test meter , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly help you in diagnosing your problem(s) . <p> Do you know , for sure , what is your current wiring configuration ? <p> Some rather simple tests , once we figure out your current wiring configuration is , will be very useful . <p> Let 's keep this simple . If you are using the above wiring diagram , do each of the relays " click " when you actuate up or down motion . I want to establish whether this is on the control side or the load side of the relay . <p> Thanks for all the help . Yes , I can use a multimeter , and yes I am very familiar with Kirby 's XJS book . And yes , I understand resistance and continuity and know how to use a multimeter to test for them . Do n't get me wrong though when it comes to electricity I consider myself not much more than a novice . <p> Its good to see that someone is familiar with Jaguars , especially the XJS . I am attaching the wiring configuration of my windows before I added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagram of the new setup . You also diagram a relay at the top . You are just showing how the Bosch relay works , am I correct ? As far as the diagram for the new setup with single pole double throw switches , that diagram may be out of my league , but give me a day or so with it and I can probably figure it out . <p> KISS you say there should be no power in the center pins of the double pole double throw switches . If you look at my wiring diagram for the DPDT switches , there IS power in the center . I did much research before I adopted the wiring diagram for the DPDT switches and there were many websites with power in the center on the DPDT switches for power window applications . So , is my diagram wrong , and if so , what is the correct way to wire the DPDT switch ? <p> Look forward to hearing from you . <p> John 77964 @qwx697964 <p> We can do this the long way or the short way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch on ? If yes , check for voltage with reference to ground at pin E. Check using a load such as a headlight . If no click , check for voltage at WK wire of relay . use headlight where possible <p> Let 's keep this simple . If you are using the above wiring diagram , do each of the relays " click " when you actuate up or down motion . I want to establish whether this is on the control side or the load side of the relay . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> In my diagram in post #6 , relays are not actuated unless the center-off switch is moved off center . <p> I also do the relay coil switching on the ground side of the relay coils , which is a bit safer than switch the 12V to the relay coils . 77970 @qwx697970 <p> KISS you say there should be no power in the center pins of the double pole double throw switches . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Well , I meant to convey that there is no power to the motor when the switch is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a correction , If the switches are momentary they would be designates as a DPDT ( on ) -off-(on) switch or a DPDT center off momentary in both positions . " none " is used if there is no center off position . <p> Maybe I 'm missing something . Is this car actually wired up right now or is this something you are trying to wire up . My understanding was that it was a working unit and now it is not . Either way , you can separate the load side from the control side to speed up diagnosis . If the relay clicks , we probably have a load side problem . If it does n't , more than likely a control side problem . Could be both but not likely . Need to know if this is existing circuit like diagram in post #9 . <p> To All : Let me clarify something . I am the OP . The car is now wired according to the diagram in my original posting . The diagram I posted in posted in posting 9 shows the factory wiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a relay setup for a different car . I adopted it for my car since the factory wiring appears to be the same . If you compare the diagrams . you can see both diagrams have circuit breakers before voltage goes to the switches . I do not want to use the Jaguar factory wiring setup because it is a bad setup . The windows go up very slowly . Many owners of the XJS switched to the relay setup I posted in the original posting . I want to use a relay setup as set forth in the diagram in my original posting . <p> As I said in my original posting , the relay setup worked for a day for one window with a 5 pin switch and then stopped working . Right now , whether I use a five pin switch or a six pin DPDT switch none of the four windows will move when I press the switches . I tested for and I have 12 volts at the switches . I tested for and I have 12 volts going to the relays . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly . I tested all of the motors and they are all working . I put in a new circuit breaker . I tested my grounds and they are all good . When I press a switch , a relay will click but only under a certain condition . I will get back to you shortly with that condition . <p> Again , sorry for my ignorance here , but could someone please explain to me what is a control side problem and what is load side problem ? My guess is a control problem has to do with the switches and a load problem has to do with the motors . Am I correct ? <p> A relay consists of two circuits . Control ( coil ) and load ( switch ) . Generally if you look at the control circuit , you will have B+ , a fuse or CB , a switch , a coil of wire in the relay and ground . When the switch is closed ( continuity ) ( does n't matter ground side or hot side ) , current will flow through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs , the switch portion of the relay will " click " into position and either close or open a circuit , depending on how it is set up . The second part of the relay ( the switch as mentioned above ) , will have B+ , perhaps a fuse or CB , a load , and B- or ground in it 's circuit . If you hear a click when the relay circuit is energized , it generally means that the first part of the circuit is working ( control ) . If you do not , go back to line 2 and figure out which part of that is not working . If you hear a click but nothing is happening with the load ( in your case , the motor ) , then you can generally look into a problem with the load circuit as outlined in line 4 . <p> If that is your existing schematic at the top , I would check for B+ ( 87 ) and B-(85) at each of the relays using a load device of some sort . Perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A test light or multimeter will not suffice . <p> Before the pundits jump in on my relay explanation , it was only meant to be a brief explanation of how a relay works . <p> In post #9 if you take 3 and A as being the back of a DPDT switch , forget it . It'sin the text as to how it behaves . <p> NOa2 ..... Ca ..... NOa1 x NOb2 , , , , , Cb .... NOb1 <p> If you were looking at the back of a DPDT switch , you would see 6 terminals . I labeled them NO and C for Normally Open and Common a and b are opposite isolated sides of the switch , 1 and 2 are the positions of the switch . <p> Code ( text ) : <p> e , g , *************1 ............. @******O *************2 <p> Think of the O as a pivot and the @ as a common contact . This ATTEMPTS to show one switch . In my ersatz ASCII ART on a BBS , ignore the periods . They hold a place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videos about relays but the one you referenced is one of the best . I printed it out and put it in my reference file . The information you have in posting 17 is way way over my head . Sorry but I do n't understand any of it . <p> Mike , I ca n't read that diagram in posting 6 . You have blue lines with numbers 80 , 86 , 87 , 87a , and 88 and two white boxes with information inside . I think the wires for the lines with numbers 86 , 87 and 87a would come from my relays but I do n't know where the wires for the lines with the numbers 80 and 88 come from . I also think that one white box show what happens when you press the switch for the window to go up and one box shows what happens when you press the switch for the window to go down . I do n't know what the 1N4001 means . I wish I was n't so ignorant , sorry . BTW , you hit the nail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the switches , they are rated for 30 amps . So , when you say they are not adequate when I believe the motors use 5 amps , I am not sure I understand . <p> bwilliams you say " if you hear a click but nothing is happening with the load ( in your case , the motor ) , then you can generally look into a problem with the load circuit as outlined in line 4 . " Please tell me where is line 4 . <p> So there it is . Now , you all know what you are dealing with . I do want to further my knowledge of electronics . <p> I am selling my house , and today I have to do some corrective work requested by the buyers . Hopefully I will get it done today , and I can get back to you on under what circumstance(s) the relay(s) click when I press the switch . <p> RE : post 17 . One of the diagrams shows a 6 pin switch as 2 rows of three , BUT inside that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way represents the external physical terminal connections of a normal DPDT switch . If you followed a this wire goes here , and the internal schematic is NOT representative , you could have a problem . I 've never seen switch arranged like that , but that does not mean that it does n't exist . <p> LOL , I may be showing my age but you can read a lot more into this if you have the background , which makes me think you are young and cocky . You see the car is an older car and the diagram uses older language . Perhaps you do n't understand it , not sure . One thing I do know is that often times , electronics types tend to make things a lot more difficult than they should be . This is a simple circuit , not rocket science and for the amount of posts on here and time taken , should be fixed already . If you know much about cars , then you would know that circuits with relays can be mostly diagnosed right at the relay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . At this point I think I will step out and watch this thread . Should be interesting to see how long it takes to fix it . KISS - KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID By the way , I do know what Vcc , GND , IGN etc means in electronics . I studied it as well .

If I am wrong , I 'll be happy ( but not too happy ) to admit it . <p> During turn-off , there will be no reverse current associated with the removal of stored charge . However , reverse current , associated with the growth of the depletion layer charge in the reverse bias , will flow . This current may be comparable to the reverse current observed during switching of a pn-junction because the space charge capacitance of a Schottky diode is larger ( as much as a factor of 5 ) then in a comparable pn-junction <p> The reason is that the depletion layer in a Schottky diode is thinner then that of a pn-junction because of the heavier doping used in the n-region of the Schottky to keep the ohmic losses under control 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Thus I stand by the fact that Schottky 's have a reverse-recovery problem just like a standard diode .

I 'll start ripping them out of my SMPS if its true . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> not saying that at all . I am just pointing out the bad points abt Schottky 's WhenI first learnt abt them at Uni they sounded great ( low volt drop , fast switching ) and I wander why they were not used that much . <p> The fact is they are great and have their place , when you need to have as much volts as possible in a situation where the diode-effect is needed - the 0.3V is too attractive . <p> So you have a switching cct one with a diode and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high on-state losses since it has a higher on-state voltage , so the Schottky ends up winnning since its conduction losses are 50% better <p> So the diode is blocking it has a leakage current , the Schottky also has one that is worse then a standard diode , but I am talking abt 100s of uA so might not be significant <p> So you come to turn-OFF of the diode and turn-ON of your switch . As stated the diode will " dump " its stored charge to provide the reverse-recovery current . This extra blat of current will increase the switching losses of both devices ( the diode has to turn-off with that extra current and the FET/IGBT must switch into an extra current of that amount ) <p> diodes tent to have switching losses in the order of single mJ so an extra few hunder As wo n't do much . The problem exists for the switching device who ( as seen in my piccy ) at its turn-on has to turn-on into extra current , be that extra current for a finite time , the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controlled devices switching losses will go up . ie cool it better <p> Styx , I see your points , and I appreciate being enlightened . I guess that with the relatively recent availability of really fast recovery PN diodes , the Schottky advantages tend to pale . I was only dimly aware of these advances in diode technology until I started researching this issue . Nevertheless , I still saw a lot of Schottkys being used in low-voltage freewheeling and flyback applications when I was researching this . Your company apparently believes that PN diodes are superior for freewheeling applications . Do you think that they are a clearly superior choice , or is it still pretty close ? <p> I have a more detailed question . If the forward current in the diode has gone to zero ( inductor has fully discharged ) before the next turn-on of the controlled device , then it seems that the PN diode would be a clear choice , because stored charge would be essentially zero , and the junction capacitance is much less than that of a comparable Schottky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see your points , and I appreciate being enlightened .

Schottky 's are still great and as I have said they have their place . I was just putting forward a couple of points abt Schottky 's <p> As to hte nevative points of a Schottky ( leakage , REverse-recovery , blocking voltage ) The only one of major concern to where I work is the blocking voltage leakage might be higher then a PN , but we are still talking abt 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in power ccts ) The reverse-recovery as has been shown exist for a Schottky as well as a PN and if the benefits of a Schottky are needed then cope with the slight higher ( then to a PN ) with better heatsinking . The only major problem is the blocking voltage - 200V is far too low <p> Now for SMPS from 12V , 28V Schottky 's are by far the superior option , but for higher voltage stuff then they can not even be touched . this is changing with Silicon Carbide - We have just been offered a 1200V 3ph H-bridge IGBT module with SiC for the diodes ! ! ! ! looking very good <p> Ron H said : <p> I have a more detailed question . If the forward current in the diode has gone to zero ( inductor has fully discharged ) before the next turn-on of the controlled device , then it seems that the PN diode would be a clear choice , because stored charge would be essentially zero , and the junction capacitance is much less than that of a comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> that is a fair statement , leaving the only deciding decision between PN and Schottky being down to the volt-drop ( be it for the conduction losses or for trying to recover as many volts as possible ) <p> Nothing is impossible . Once a problem is realised , the rest is just details <p> Schottky 's have a capacitance which must be discharged when switching between on &amp; off states . The reverse recovery of a Schottky is negligible . Although the junction capacitance of a Schottky is higher than that of a p-n junction , the p-n exhibits higher switching losses due to stored minority carrier charge . <p> This is very well known . During switching , the Schottky will incur greater loss due to capacitance than a p-n , as the Schottky has greater capacitance vs. a p-n . But the losses incurred in a p-n via minority charge is even greater yet . So Schottky diodes are preferred for switching at low voltages where the reverse leakage is n't too great . <p> At high voltages , Schottky diodes are less desirable . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schottky has high forward voltage drop . At high voltages this may not be a problem . I use ultrafast p-n diodes for anything over 100 volts .

I would n't mind making up a PIC circuit or something similar to show it . I 've got so many inductors I 've got little data on that came from surplus catalogs , and now I realize I ca n't use them without figuring this out . <p> Actually , what 's the most practical way to measure inductance ? I 'd like to check up on that rather than rely on the surplus guy 's word for it . <p> Is there any practical way to measure core losses at higher frequencies ? <p> Well an air-cored inductor will never saturate . For a iron-core inductor the best way is to plot a B-H curve on a X-Y channel scope - I have lost teh link but very simple to do , just need a current trasformer . <p> The way I test inductance is to put a put a pulse of voltage across it ( plus free-wheel diode ) and then go : <p> V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you can measure di . <p> I think you might be able to use this techneque as well to find teh point of saturation ( just look for a knee in the current ramp signalling the saturation point of the core ) <p> Ill have a think and find the B-H test setup <p> Nothing is impossible . Once a problem is realised , the rest is just details <p> When an inductor saturates it 's inductance goes from a relatively high value to a relatively low value , meaning the current rises very sharply and on the scope it looks like a spike of current ( using say a current probe ) . At that point the current is limited by only the series resistance of the coil Rs , so the current would be due to whatever dc voltage is applied divided by that Rs . It can be very very high for power electronics inductors and can blow out transistors unless some means to prevent this is also incorporated into the circuit . Many modern circuits monitor the max inductor current to prevent the power transistor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ max current as a means of regulation . <p> Oh yeah one more thing worth mentioning is that sometimes the best circuit to use to test an inductor is the actual circuit it is being used in . In other words , check the inductor current in the circuit it is working in presently and see if you can find some mode that makes the inductor saturate . That 's the best test . Just before the inductor ' saturates ' the current slope increases , so that 's a tell-tale sign that something is going wrong . Many times it will be almost perfectly straight , then curve up near the end of the pulse when something is not quite right . <p> Last edited : Oct 4 , 2010 77974 @qwx697974

Thanks ! 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Hi , <p> In order to really measure the equivalent series resistance you have to use a pulse measurement system . It 's similar to measuring the ESR of a capacitor . Although not exactly that simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resistance really was . That 's if you really need to know this . <p> The reason for using a pulse is because as the voltage is applied the state of charge changes and we wont know what the ' internal ' ( past the ESR ) voltage really is so there 's no way to apply Ohm 's Law that directly . With a pulse we can make the measurement quickly before the state changes too much and that makes it possible to use Ohm 's Law . Of course this requires a micro controller of some sort , or some fast measuring system that can be sync 'd to the pulse time . <p> The internal resistance is really more complicated than a single resistor , but that will give some idea what is going on and might provide for some comparative data that might be used later to compare to other batteries of the same type or to monitor over the age of the battery . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Thanks for the responses . I suspected it was n't as simple as Ohm 's Law using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole motivation for my post . We have a generator connected to a battery charger ( it 's really an AC/DC rectifier with some battery smarts in it ) . Downstream of the charger are two 24V batteries in parallel and a load in parallel . See the diagram attached . There is a concern about what would happen if the system is turned on when the batteries are fully drained . Since the load is in parallel with the charging batteries , and the charger is limited to 50A , the load will subjected to the lower DC voltage . If the depleted batteries drive the charger 's voltage down too low when the generator is turned on , the load ( which is sensitive electronic equipment ) may experience undervoltage conditions until the batteries recover . <p> I was able to test the circuit in the attached diagram , but only with one battery . With just that one , the initial charge voltage dropped to 22.5V . Since the charger is limited to 50A , adding a 2nd battery would drive the voltage down even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial DC voltage will be across the load when both batteries are in the circuit . Any further ideas are greatly appreciated . <p> The voltage across the load will be exactly the same as the voltage across the batteries , i.e. 13V when the batts are fully depleted , if 13V is your criterion for deciding depletion. 77973 @qwx697973 <p> Because the voltage across the load will be the same as the voltage across the batteries , I am concerned with how low the voltage will drop when both batteries are in the circuit and the 50A charger is turned on . <p> I think my description is confusing . Sorry about that . Let me describe it this way : <p> Under normal circumstances , the two 24V batteries are kept at a start of full charge and the AC/DC converter happily runs the system at about 28V . The batteries pull almost nothing and the load pulls about 25A or so . Well under the 50A limit . <p> The situation I 'm concerned with is when the generator quits , which turns off the AC/DC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but eventually they go dead . The generator is then turned back on . The DC voltage will be driven down well below the typical 28V in order to maintain the 50A limit . That 's the voltage I 'm trying to determine . <p> If this is the case , I think that you should be looking at a different configuration , either a current limiter on the battery charge circuit , or a separate charger from the main 50A PSU. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Agree completely . And that 's actually the end goal of this investigation - to recommend a power system redesign . <p> In order to get to that point , though , I 'd like to be able to present some calculations that show " how bad " the situation is . We 've already shipped out a couple units with the current design . Apparently , the original engineers never considered what would happen if the generator conked out . So the powers that be need a lot of convincing to understand what needs to be done . I figure the more details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did some PSpice-ing and came up with a number . I went back to my test setup and got some better values ( the values in my original post were recalled from memory .... a very poor memory ) . The battery was actually at about 15.3V at the point we considered it " depleted " . When power was turned on , the DC output was 21.5V . I figured out the equivalent resistance of the load at 0.88Ohm . I set up a circuit with a single battery , a 21.5V source , and the 0.88Ohm load . I tweaked the internal battery resistance until the currents looked pretty close to what I was measuring . The internal resistance came out to be 0.24Ohm . <p> I then added a second battery with exactly the same properties . This time I adjusted the DC voltage of the supply until the supply current was 50A . The end result was 18.85V . The attached screen capture is the final circuit that I think should approximately predict the numbers I was looking for . <p> I think you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to look at the load characteristics of the PSU . Load it up to 50A and beyond and measure the voltage . Only then will you be able to determine voltage available , it is the PSU which is losing output volts , not the battery . <p> JimB <p> Experience is directly proportional to the value of the equipment ruined . <p> JimB , I 'm not entirely sure I follow you . When I turned on power to my test setup ( one battery and the load in parallel ) , the DC PSU immediately pegged at 50A . So it was loaded as much as it could go . In order to keep the current at 50A , it has to lower its output voltage to abide by Ohm 's Law .

How do I calculate the minimum inductance required for the primary ? I would prefer the calculator than someone to do the sums for me , I might change the current or frequency . Regards , Szzuk . <p> There are many electronicians , both hobby and professional , who are at war with electromagnetism . Whenever they need to design a coil or a transformer , an abyss of desperation opens in front of these poor people . The worst thing is that usually these poor victims are not really at fault , since the authors of electronic textbooks seem to have struck a plot to explain these things in such a messy way that nobody can really understand them ! Or maybe these authors themselves did n't have a clue about the matter ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> This quote from the start of that website is exactly were I 'm at . I have all the kit to make transformers and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of them worked properly , or at all ... <p> I mentioned magnetisation because I have a transformer I made some time ago which has the 1:5 turns ratio I currently need , however when I tried it I found I was only getting a small voltage on the primary . I guessed I 'd reached the saturation point of the current and had n't magnetised the transformer properly . Has my terminology got really ugly now ? <p> Are you trying to get some level of magnetization for some reason or do you just need to design a transformer for step up or down use ? <p> I ask because the " transformer equation " takes into account the inductance so you do n't  have to explicitly calculate that . You just have to know the input voltage and frequency , and of course facts about the transformer construction . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Well i think you can ignore the primary inductance for now and start with the transformer equation for square waves : <p> B=E*108/ ( 4*F*A*N ) where B is the flux density in Gauss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , F is the frequency in Hertz , A is the cross sectional area of the core in square centimeters , N is the number of primary turns . <p> What you do is select the core area and number of turns that give you a reasonable B value that the core material can handle . For ferrite this can be quite low like 1000 , but for steel laminations as high as 20000 . Usually you 'd want to be on the ramped part of the BH curve somewhat lower than Bsat for that material so that if you get a larger input ( sometimes a surge ) the construction can still deal with it . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Are you making a switch mode supply , or are you making a high freq transformer supply , such as a car stereo voltage booster ? <p> Your original design problem probably was due to core saturation its one of the tricky parts of trannys , voltage and time need to be considered and the maximum flux density the core will take . <p> I have a little test jig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to what flux density the core will take of a particular core , I re-use trannys from scrap tv 's anything like that as inductors and transformers . <p> Do n't  expect to get a high efficiency supply straight away , there 's a lot to consider in a switcher , however you can get a working supply with a little care . <p> A bulb in series with the incomming power to limit current has saved me a few fets and controller chips . <p> Are you making a switch mode supply , or are you making a high freq transformer supply , such as a car stereo voltage booster ? <p> Your original design problem probably was due to core saturation its one of the tricky parts of trannys , voltage and time need to be considered and the maximum flux density the core will take . <p> I have a little test jig which tells you the al value and gives an idea as to what flux density the core will take of a particular core , I re-use trannys from scrap tv 's anything like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a high efficiency supply straight away , there 's a lot to consider in a switcher , however you can get a working supply with a little care . <p> A bulb in series with the incomming power to limit current has saved me a few fets and controller chips . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Its a piezo driver test rig . It allows me to change frequency and voltages on my piezos . The rig works fine for my typical piezos with a bought transformer allowing 600V at any frequency up to 150Khz . However I have new piezos with higher current requirements and needing up to 200V . So I need to swop my bought 1:12 trafo for another of around 1:5 , the bought one does n't work with these new piezos . The piezo has a capacitance of around 170nF so much of the current will just be getting stored rather than used ( I think ) . <p> Ok so i 'll assume it is a ferrite core and set B=1000 .

I learned a few things : <p> Be aware that 5 turns is the minimum . Any less and the B goes up . <p> This equation comes in handy for calculating inductance : <p> L = 0.4 * pi * n2 * mu * Ae/Le * 10-8 <p> L is in Henries . Ae is in square cm . Le is in cm . You can verify the Al values given for different cores with this equation . It works for all cored transformers with no gap . <p> There are also urban myths about transformers out there in the ether , like " Spread out the winding neatly all around the toroidal core for good coupling . " Actually , It does n't really matter how the windings are dressed around a high-mu core , so long as they go through the hole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for power transformers use high mu cores . If the core has a mu of 2000 , it means that there is 2000 times more magnetic flux in the core as there would be if it were an air core , so the magnetic flux " leakage " that exists outside the core is so small that it can be ignored . And , you might consider an E core instead . They are easier to wind . <p> If you want to go from 0 to 150kc or even 10kc to 150kc then you 'll need something special transformer wise . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I was wondering about that , I could n't tell you why the bought trafo I use works from 0-150KHz with my other piezos ! I guess I could make a few trafos when I can get one working ... what range would you suggest ? <p> start fromt the beginning core saturation is largely caused by having voltage present accross the windings for too long , which means frequency is important . you can design a transfo to operate at your lowest frequency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is however a limit where the losses in the core become significant at higher freq 's . I 'm still not sure if your design is a flyback psu or a step up transformer setup , I 'm guessing the latter from what you 've said . If you read through harry ludens site on trannys you 'll be able to plug in the values ffrom the etd20 datasheet and work out your primary turns , the important ones are max flux density , and al factor . If your design is a stepup transformer rather than a flyback device then current in the primary is largely dependant on current in the secondary , if you 've put one together and tested it without a load on the secondary and the primary current is small then that 's a good sign , the core is n't saturating. tip , if your operating at 100kc or higher then you might want to use either litz wire or 5 or 6 smallers wires to make up the csa to reduce skin effect which becomes significant at these freq 's , I know this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait to be corrected , I 'm not an expert on magnetics I know what I 've had to so I could get by . <p> Hi , it is a step up trafo i 'm building , not a flyback . I 've decided to buy some of the gapped cores for the EFD20 so I can reduce B and add more turns . The material I 've been using for the core is N87 or N97 , both are supposed to be fine for over 400KHz frequencies . I might need some bigger cores too , I 'll look at them when I get a chance to use the Ludens website to do some calcs . <p> I do n't know what litz wire is ? Or 5 or 6 smaller wires ? The terminology is n't familar with me , however I can probably order some easily with the gapped cores . <p> For your Expermintation , You should not use PRE-Gapped cores . I find it is usually better to wind on Un-Gapped cores . Than you can Add a Gap by applying a Thin piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you need a Bigger gap , Two or three Layers of tape . <p> Litz Wire is Multiple Strands of Parallel Wires and it is Better for Higher Frequencies . <p> Considering 40 Volts input and 200mA , you need a reasonable amount of Inductance . I would say defiinately more than 100uH . <p> For your Expermintation , You should not use PRE-Gapped cores . I find it is usually better to wind on Un-Gapped cores .

At the output of the rectifier I am connecting 0.47uF-250V , mylar capacitor and across the capacitor I am connecting resistive load . The bridge should rectify 120 VAC from a WALL OUTLET to obtain a DC voltage . I am trying to acheive as close as possible to 170 VDC . Now the problem is that I want to get this voltage with respect to circuit ground . What happens is if I try to connect other end of the capacitor to ground some diodes blow off . Even if I try to connect oscilloscope between two terminal of capacitor some diode blows off . I searched it over the net and found out similar post : LONG ... I think I am also facing the similar problem . Could anyone please tell me why this is happening ? Why the other end of the capacitor is not always at potential 0V ? What should I do now to get a 170V DC power supply ? I mesure the voltages at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a 10X probe to the circuit and floating the probe 's ground . And I saw that capactor terminal that I think should be at 0V is actually oscillating between 0V and -170V . At the same time other end of the capacitor is oscillating between 170V and 0V . Hence together they will give me 170VDC . But how to connect them to another circuit ? Kindly provide some inputs I am so confused . Thank you . Sincerely Richeek Arya <p> Look at the schematic for a bridge rectifier . The common of the bridge is not connected to the common of the source . If you connect the common of the bridge to the common of the source , then you will blow one or more of the rectifiers since there 's a direct path from the hot side through the rectifier to common ( ground ) . <p> Yes , neutral is connected to ground . That 's why you blew the rectifier . <p> If you want a grounded connection from a line powered rectifier , then you can only use a half wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since you are not isolated from the AC power and a lethal shock is possible if you touch any part of the circuit when also touching ground . <p> I am confused about one thing . If neutral wire is connected to ground then it means the potential of the Hot wire is changing between +120VAC to -120VAC during the cycle . Potential of the neutral is constant 0V . So one end of the output is always at 0V . So how does it causing a short ? I have attached a pic too to make myself more clear . <p> If you look at the Full Wave Resistive Supply you will see the 4 diodes in the bridge . If you connect the 0v output to say the lower AC line , you will short-out the left lower diode . This means the top left diode will work when the AC is in one direction but become a short when the AC reverses . The only solution is to produce a half-wave supply as shown in the 4th circuit . That 's why it is important to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is going on . <p> Can you explain me one thing and I am contrdicting myself . If the neutral is always grounded how does the rectifer circuit works in the negative cycle . Assume that it is driving a capacitive load ? My doubt is that during positive half cycle capacitor will get charged and when the negative cycle comes bottom right diode ( in your figure ) will be reverse biased as the anode is grounded and cathode is at poitive voltagevso there is not path for the current to flow . <p> Can you explain me one thing and I am contrdicting myself .

For the proper voltage ratio , currents in the top and bottom resistor must be equal and drawing current out from the center-tap will reduce current available in the lower resistor . The net effect is that as more current is drawn from the divider , it 's output voltage will sag more and more in proportion . <p> To get a voltage that does n't droop by more than 5% , the current in the rest of the divider must be 20x higher than the current being drawn from it . That 's a lot of wasted power and a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will sag more the more current is drawn . And the worst part is that the power is wasted and heat is generated even when small amounts of current are being drawn since most of it is just flowing through the resistors to ground . For example , for 100mA , you need 2A in the rest of the divider . If you want 1% droop , then that 's 10A . Not a great way to go about things . <p> If you really want no distortion , you should just a high resistance divider and buffer it with an op-amp buffer . Then you have a steady voltage output with no distortion from current draw . The voltage will be much more stable with current draw and heat will be reduced with reduced current draw . <p> The equivalent resistance of any voltage divider is Req = ( R1 x R2 ) / ( R1 + R2 ) .

After recalculating , you can again use Ohm 's law to calculate the divider output , which is the voltage that Rload will feel . <p> So , you can see why there is no absolute answer to your question ... it all depends on what you want to connect to it . <p> As has already been stated here before , it all depends on what you 're trying to do . <p> Now ... a voltage divider comprised of low resistance resistors will draw more current from the supply than one comprised of high resistance resistors . This is the actual current flowing through the divider itself . This current must be subtracted from the total available from the supply . <p> The upside of voltage dividers comprised of low resistance resistors is that they 're harder to load them . The downside is they draw more current from the supply . Vice versa for a voltage divider comprised of high resistance resistors . <p> Every time you add a branch to the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch drops the total circuit resistance . If you drop it so far as to tax the available current supply , you 're overloading the supply . <p> Now ... when you place a resistor between the positive side of a circuit and the positive rail you form a voltage divider . The circuit itself becomes the " bottom resistor " in the divider . The amount of voltage dropped across said resistor is equal to the product of the current drawn by said circuit and the resistor 's value in Ohms ( Ohm 's Law ... E = I x R ) . <p> However , when you add a circuit across the bottom resistor in a voltage divider , you decrease its effective value . The effective value it drops to is determined by the total circuit resistance and the value of the bottom resistor itself . Adding the circuit across the bottom divider resistor is electrically equivalent to adding a 2nd resistor in parallel with the bottom resistor . This increases current draw through the top resistor , which in turn increases the amount of voltage dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of voltage available at the divider 's output . <p> Therefore , to keep the voltage output the same when a circuit gets added , you must drop the value of the top resistor in the divider to allow more current through without dropping more voltage across the top divider resistor.

Thus the process goes like this : <p> 1 . Kill all sources . 2 . Unkill one source only and calculate the response for that source , then kill it again . 3 . Repeat #2 above until all sources have been done with all individual responses calculated . 4 . Add up all the individual responses calculated in #2 above to get the total response . <p> Just one more little thing ... <p> If you try this with a real circuit when you kill a voltage source you have to first disconnect it and then short out the two nodes it had connected to , and when you kill a current source you have to first short it out and then disconnect one of the nodes completely to disconnect it from the circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voltage or current first which makes sense .

@@71811833 @511833/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> The oscilloscope is basically a graph-displaying device - it draws a graph of an electrical signal . In most applications the graph shows how signals change over time : the vertical ( Y ) axis represents voltage and the horizontal ( X ) axis represents time . The intensity or brightness of the display is sometimes called the Z axis . ( See Figure 1 . ) This simple graph can tell you many things about a signal . Here are a few : <p> You can determine the time and voltage values of a signal . <p> You can calculate the frequency of an oscillating signal . <p> You can see the " moving parts " of a circuit represented by the signal . <p> You can tell if a malfunctioning component is distorting the signal . <p> You can find out how much of a signal is direct current ( DC ) or alternating current ( AC ) . <p> You can tell how much of the signal is noise and whether the noise is changing with time . <p> Figure 1 : X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An oscilloscope looks a lot like a small television set , except that it has a grid drawn on its screen and more controls than a television .

They are indispensable for anyone designing or repairing electronic equipment . The usefulness of an oscilloscope is not limited to the world of electronics . With the proper transducer , an oscilloscope can measure all kinds of phenomena . A transducer is a device that creates an electrical signal in response to physical stimuli , such as sound , mechanical stress , pressure , light , or heat .

The possibilities are endless . <p> Figure 4 : Scientific Data Gathered by an Oscilloscope <p> Analog and Digital <p> Electronic equipment can be divided into two types : analog and digital . Analog equipment works with continuously variable voltages , while digital equipment works with discrete binary numbers that may represent voltage samples . For example , a conventional phonograph turntable is an analog device ; a compact disc player is a digital device . Oscilloscopes also come in analog and digital types . An analog oscilloscope works by directly applying a voltage being measured to an electron beam moving across the oscilloscope screen . The voltage deflects the beam up and down proportionally , tracing the waveform on the screen . This gives an immediate picture of the waveform . <p> In contrast , a digital oscilloscope samples the waveform and uses an analog-to-digital converter ( or ADC ) to convert the voltage being measured into digital information . It then uses this digital information to reconstruct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Digital and Analog Oscilloscopes Display Waveforms <p> For many applications either an analog or digital oscilloscope will do . However , each type does possess some unique characteristics making it more or less suitable for specific tasks . <p> People often prefer analog oscilloscopes when it is important to display rapidly varying signals in " real time " ( or as they occur ) . <p> Digital oscilloscopes allow you to capture and view events that may happen only once . They can process the digital waveform data or send the data to a computer for processing . Also , they can store the digital waveform data for later viewing and printing . <p> How Does an Oscilloscope Work ? <p> To better understand the oscilloscope controls , you need to know a little more about how oscilloscopes display a signal . Analog oscilloscopes work somewhat differently than digital oscilloscopes . However , several of the internal systems are similar .

Figure 6 is a simple block diagram that shows how an analog oscilloscope displays a measured signal . <p> Figure 6 : Analog Oscilloscope Block Diagram <p> Depending on how you set the vertical scale ( volts/div control ) , an attenuator reduces the signal voltage or an amplifier increases the signal voltage . <p> Next , the signal travels directly to the vertical deflection plates of the cathode ray tube ( CRT ) . Voltage applied to these deflection plates causes a glowing dot to move . ( An electron beam hitting phosphor inside the CRT creates the glowing dot . ) A positive voltage causes the dot to move up while a negative voltage causes the dot to move down . <p> The signal also travels to the trigger system to start or trigger a " horizontal sweep . " Horizontal sweep is a term referring to the action of the horizontal system causing the glowing dot to move across the screen . Triggering the horizontal system causes the horizontal time base to move the glowing dot across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interval . Many sweeps in rapid sequence cause the movement of the glowing dot to blend into a solid line . At higher speeds , the dot may sweep across the screen up to 500,000 times each second . <p> Together , the horizontal sweeping action and the vertical deflection action traces a graph of the signal on the screen . The trigger is necessary to stabilize a repeating signal . It ensures that the sweep begins at the same point of a repeating signal , resulting in a clear picture as shown in Figure 7 . <p> Figure 7 : Triggering Stabilizes a Repeating Waveform <p> In conclusion , to use an analog oscilloscope , you need to adjust three basic settings to accommodate an incoming signal : <p> The attenuation or amplification of the signal . Use the volts/div control to adjust the amplitude of the signal before it is applied to the vertical deflection plates . <p> The time base . Use the sec/div control to set the amount of time per division represented horizontally across the screen . <p> The triggering of the oscilloscope . Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as triggering on a single event . Also , adjusting the focus and intensity controls enables you to create a sharp , visible display . <p> Digital Oscilloscopes <p> Some of the systems that make up digital oscilloscopes are the same as those in analog oscilloscopes ; however , digital oscilloscopes contain additional data processing systems . ( See Figure 8 . ) With the added systems , the digital oscilloscope collects data for the entire waveform and then displays it . <p> When you attach a digital oscilloscope probe to a circuit , the vertical system adjusts the amplitude of the signal , just as in the analog oscilloscope . <p> Next , the analog-to-digital converter ( ADC ) in the acquisition system samples the signal at discrete points in time and converts the signal 's voltage at these points to digital values called sample points . The horizontal system 's sample clock determines how often the ADC takes a sample . The rate at which the clock " ticks " is called the sample rate and is measured in samples per second . <p> The sample points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More than one sample point may make up one waveform point . <p> Together , the waveform points make up one waveform record . The number of waveform points used to make a waveform record is called the record length . The trigger system determines the start and stop points of the record . The display receives these record points after being stored in memory . <p> Depending on the capabilities of your oscilloscope , additional processing of the sample points may take place , enhancing the display . Pretrigger may be available , allowing you to see events before the trigger point . <p> Figure 8 : Digital Oscilloscope Block Diagram <p> Fundamentally , with a digital oscilloscope as with an analog oscilloscope , you need to adjust the vertical , horizontal , and trigger settings to take a measurement . <p> Sampling Methods <p> The sampling method tells the digital oscilloscope how to collect sample points . For slowly changing signals , a digital oscilloscope easily collects more than enough sample points to construct an accurate picture . However , for faster signals , ( how fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oscilloscope can not collect enough samples . The digital oscilloscope can do two things : <p> It can collect a few sample points of the signal in a single pass ( in real-time sampling mode ) and then use interpolation . Interpolation is a processing technique to estimate what the waveform looks like based on a few points . <p> It can build a picture of the waveform over time , as long as the signal repeats itself ( equivalent-time sampling mode ) . <p> Real-Time Sampling with Interpolation <p> Digital oscilloscopes use real-time sampling as the standard sampling method . In real-time sampling , the oscilloscope collects as many samples as it can as the signal occurs . ( See Figure 9 . ) For single-shot or transient signals you must use real time sampling . <p> Figure 9 : Real-time Sampling <p> Digital oscilloscopes use interpolation to display signals that are so fast that the oscilloscope can only collect a few sample points . Interpolation " connects the dots . " <p> Linear interpolation simply connects sample points with straight lines . Sine interpolation ( or sin x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( See Figure 10 . ) Sin x over x interpolation is a mathematical process similar to the " oversampling " used in compact disc players . With sine interpolation , points are calculated to fill in the time between the real samples . Using this process , a signal that is sampled only a few times in each cycle can be accurately displayed or , in the case of the compact disc player , accurately played back . <p> Figure 10 : Linear and Sine Interpolation <p> Equivalent-Time Sampling <p> Some digital oscilloscopes can use equivalent-time sampling to capture very fast repeating signals . Equivalent-time sampling constructs a picture of a repetitive signal by capturing a little bit of information from each repetition . ( See Figure 11 . ) You see the waveform slowly build up like a string of lights going on one-by-one . With sequential sampling the points appear from left to right in sequence ; with random sampling the points appear randomly along the waveform . <p> The main difference between an analog scope and a digital one , forgetting the advantages and disadvantages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an analog fashion , and a digital scope samples signal in a digital fashion . <p> Concentrating on sampling methods only , why would this mean that a digital scope is not a real time instrument , just because it samples digitally ? <p> Probably not . In the same way a computer processes data so fast it may seem real-time to slow human reflexes , but it still takes a finite amount of time . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I do n't think you understand what a real time oscilloscope is . It means that the scope effectively captures a single " window " of time . For example , a real time scope will capture say 1 million data samples corresponding to a single trigger acquisition . In other words , for the 100us or whatever the capture length is , the scope is " seeing " everything . Contrast this to an equivalent time scope , which uses multiple triggers and multiple waveforms to build up that same 100us time window . <p> Probably not . In the same way a computer processes data so fast it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a finite amount of time . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> The very definition of " real time " is that an operation is completed so quickly that it appears to happen instantaneously . A Multitasking OS operates in real time if it is able to switch between programs so quickly that they all appear to run simultaneously , although we know this not to actually be true . If we were to say that nothing is " real time " unless it happens instantaneously , then we would have to say that nothing works in real time , because EVERYTHING takes a finite time to happen . <p> If a real time oscilloscope is an instrument which displays the waveform on screen as it is captured as opposed to storing it for later examination , then my digital scope is both a real time instrument and not a real time intrument at the same time - because I can operate it as a normal scope OR save a waveform to memory for later examination if I choose to at any time . <p> someone here has an ideal about OSC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an Oscilloscope ( it 's run very well ) . You need to use your sound card and a software to support . however , Using your PC as an OSC is not better than real OSC . I offent get some error when I mesasure volt or ampe.

@@71811837 @511837/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> Generally , diodes are used sometimes to avoid adding a logic gate when no extra gates are available , or desired . They are also used to clamp logic gate inputs to within a diode drop of another voltage , where the possibility of exceeding voltage levels exists . There are other uses , too . <p> Without specific examples to share , specific explanation is a shot in the dark , but here is one generalized example you may have seen . <p> Say the input A to a logic gate is driven by the output A of another logic gate and you want one state ( either high or low ) of an output B from a yet another logic gate to override the input/output A. Of course , you can gate output B with output A to drive input A using a gate , but that requires an added gate . Instead you connect output B to input/output A using a diode . The diode conducts only when the output B is high or low ( but not both ) depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the output A can be effectively " overpowered " by the output B. The " overpowering " requirement can be satisfied by putting a series resistor between the output A and the input A and connecting the diode to the input A. This example is generally applicable to CMOS logic where the series resistor does not have an adverse effect on gate operation owing to the very high input impedance of CMOS logic . Also the loss of voltage due to the diode 's voltage drop is of little concern with CMOS logic due to the higher supply voltage and wider noise margin . <p> The 1n4148 metal doped diodes are widely used because they are faster and cheaper than ordinary silicon diodes yet still have the capacity to handle the small amount of current and reverse voltages encountered .

@@71811838 @511838/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> Nope , dknguyen is right--you 're stuck with the wavelength the LED in question was designed for . <p> That said , you *can* get different wavelengths out of LEDs by running too much current through them . You 'll have to change the LED every few seconds though , as the weird colours they give off are soon replaced by smoke . I 've gotten some pretty orange tones from red LEDs this way . Then they quickly became DEDs ( dark-emitting diodes ) . <p> Perhaps there is an LED material that has the bandgap you want . If you want to go deeper UV then you need a higher energy bandgap . I do n't know if they exist , b/c you did not mention what wavelength you wanted . For lasers , deep UV is a pain . There is as of yet no material that lases at those deep UV ( 266nm ) wavelengths . As a result , you usually have to use a 1066nm source , than you double to 533nm then you use a crystal that basically takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy ( and consequently half the wavelength ) to get 266 . I think the last time I worked with one it drew 2000W of power to generate 150mW of UV . It also had a dessicant pump and a chiller to keep the crystal resonator at a consistent temperature . I ca n't remember the per hour cost of running it , but it was fairly hight . <p> I think that 300-400nm would suit my needs . I do n't need it for any sort of laser , I am just testing a little mineral fluorescence . I was thinking that i could just get one type of LED for both long and short wave UV . I do n't  need anything on the germicidal scale(250&lt;nm) . Thanks for answering the question ! <p> I see , I misunderstood , what I thought is that you wanted to have a system that is outputting UV at a specific wavelength that was different than the LED you had . Now that I see your response , what you want is to be able to arbitrarily set the wavelength . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work at all the wavelengths you listed . I am not even sure filtering a UV source ( not an LED ) would be able to do all those , maybe . <p> Yes , the wavelength of a LED is fixed , what about using a few of them with different wavelengths and switch them as needed ? If you are looking for LEDs with unusual wavelengths for sale have a look here : <p> a wave length of 300nm is already very dangerous if that light hits your unprotected eyes and causes more damage than looking directly into the arc of an arc welder . They do produce 340nm UV-LEDs ( UV-A ) at Seoul semconductors , but for a horrible price of 53US$ per piece if your order is 100pieces at least . <p> You can however purchase UV-LEDs emitting at 400nm for a reasonable price of US$ 1.96 .

Maybe the same applies for your country . <p> Perhaps OP can clarify ... Do you want an adjustable UV source , iow , do you want to be able to sweep the frequencies ? Or is it a fixed set of frequencies you desire . <p> 300nm is dangerous , so is 266 especially at the power density of a laser . On our 266 laser , putting flammable objects in the beam causes them to combust almost instantly . To find the beam , I use an index card that I colored with highlighter . We also have UV detector cards but they are expensive and like 1/8 the size of an index card . <p> I do n't know about the restrictions here , the one we use is the Coherent Azure .

First i wanted to make some sort of device that i could find the optimal fluorescing wavelength of the various minerals . I have found charts online , but they only give a broad range . See this : LONG ... Most minerals are divided into long and short UV wavelengths . From what I understand long and short are in two broad ranges of the UV spectrum . 400 nm - 315 nm for long , and 280 nm - 100 nm for short . If the shortwave LEDs are going to be too much of a hassle to get , then i will just stick with the longer wavelengths . Would the germicidal LEDs still hurt your eyes looking only at the fluoresced mineral , or do you have to be looking right at the LED source ? <p> Anyway , I suppose I should just get some cheap long wave UV LEDs and see which minerals I can use with them .

I understand how the 4017 IC works but the schematic masks the interaction between the 4017 and the 4069 and how the 4069 makes the decade counter ( 4017 ) slow down and stop . I am willing to offer a stipend ( $50/hr ) to someone who can help me discover this knowledge . <p> The slow-down circuit consists of the top three gates , R3 , D1 , C2 , R4 and C3 .

The HIGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100k and this gradually reduces the voltage on the 47u . As the voltage on the 47u falls , the time taken to charge the 1u increases and crates the slow-down effect . Eventually the voltage on the 1u is not enough to put a HIGH on Pin 11 and the circuit freezes . It really only needs 2 gates and 6 components . <p> Thanks for the explanation . In an effort to try to understand the relationship between the 4069 and the 4017 better I have redrawn the schematic using the manufacturer 's pin diagram . I think understand why Velleman drew the schematic the way they did when you see the convoluted result : **25;1266;TOOLONG , attached . <p> I believe I am getting the idea that the slow down and eventual freesze of the circuit operation is caused by the interaction between the 1u ( C2 ) and 47u capacitors . I assume when you say " puts a HIGH on input pin 11. " you are talking about the pin on the 4069 . <p> A practical condideration of adapting the circuit to the plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of the box , are soldered to the PCB had to extend the leads to the LEDS .

Would the ciecuit work with a two pole switch ? <p> The circuit needs an on-off switch and a push-on-switch . The voltage on the 1u rises and falls around the mid-voltage needed by the inverter to change the state of the inverter .

For a discussion of how it works , here is my analysis from another forum : <p> That oscillator is n't what you think it is . IC1D and IC1E form a non-inverting buffer with hysteresis , which can act as a latch . It is IC1A with feedback through D1 and R2 that turns it into an oscillator . The original designer is playing some games with the resistor value ratios . For example , R1 can override the hysteresis feedback coming in through R2 , and R4 might figure in there depending on the output state at pin 2 . <p> As the overall circuit slows down , R3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you tied the three inverters ( pins 13 , 3 , and 5 ) to pin 10 instead of the switch , then the LEDs would blink off briefly when changing from one LED to the next , and as the circuit slows down the off time would be constant and the on times would get longer and longer until the circuit stops on its final value . VERY nice . <p> There was a question about this type of decreasing frequency circuit on another forum .

But if you look at RC speciic manufacturesr of pinions , you can start to find pinions far far below that number ( 6 being the absolute lowest I 've ever seen by a long shot and only from one place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just taking a guess but it seems the 20 degree pressure angle is the most widely used . <p> EDIT : Paper 1 , lower down on the same page seems to say that you can undercut teeth ( remove material at the root ) which will weaken the gaer but remove the material which will cause gear interference if you move below the theoretical minimum ... of course that does n't help with the deviation from a circle-shape though . The paper then says that this would reduce the minimum teeth of a 20 degree pressure angle gear from 13 to 10 which seems inline most of the RC pinions that I have seen . Still does n't explain the 6T gear though ! <p> I can tell you from experience that the 6T gears SUCK ! ! ! We switched from a 6T to a 7T in fifty RC cars , and in spite of the reduced ratio it had more oomph and used less power ( and we did very careful measurements of that power throughput ) . <p> When I photographed the 6T gear under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were sort of bulb-shaped. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> So yeah , that undercutting might explain it resulting in your " bulb shaped teeth " . If you look very closely at the root of the gear in these photos ( especially the first 4 which are of the unusually low tooth count variety , the root is clearer skinner than the rest of the tooth and gets fatter as the tooth count increases . It still seems to go far below the theoretical minimum , even for undercut teeth ... maybe that 's why the 6T gears were so crappy . <p> Would compressor lobe interface meet the definition of a gear even though neither lobe is actually driving the other , both being driven . It looks like the lobes of this compressor could be pressed into sevice as a gear train . Recently I took part in the rebuild of a 250 hp compressor . The driving gears on the lobes had been removed so you could turn one lobe by hand and it would drive the other lobe . Could this demonstrate a 2 tooth gear ?

So , this would be an important consideration when looking for a formula . I ca n't help you with the current of your battery .

This seems to me to be about room temperature , which I imagine is what most formulas are made for unless otherwise specified . It may be that the optimal operating conditions for electromagnets are much different from room temperature . Perhaps this optimal temperature is as cold as possible without too many crystals forming on the electromagnet from the atmosphere .

@@71811844 @511844/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Speed of operation <p> I am studying memory hierarchy right now , and i came to the conclusion that Computers speed of operation depends on slowest memory working inside it . That means it does n't  matter if we continue to increase the speed of CPU from Mhz to Ghz , majority of programmes running on computer will be slow , with high latency and slow response time . <p> So , the real problem is increasing the speed of memory read and write . did i get things correctly ? <p> secondly , if one memory has high read speed but slow write speed or vice versa , what will be the consequences of that on computer systems . 77971 @qwx697971 <p> Basically it is true . Caches are a way to increase the dataflow , as well as multithreading , which when a cache fault occurs allows the procesor to switch context to other thread which has data ready , so the first process waits until the data gets loaded into the cache . This provides better utilisation of cpu power , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only solution is to either pre-cache data - this is usually not possible under OS for L1 .. 3 caches , so such memory intensive application would have to be standalone and carefully use the available caches to get the best performace . For disk I/O , applications should pre-cache into dram , which is 1000 faster than hard disks , and work with data in memory . <p> Another way for getting faster dram access is slicing the ram into multiple physical banks so you get faster throughput overall . <p> Second question depends on which memory you-re talking about . Hard disks have comaparatively large caches than drams , so slow write speeds can be somewhat masked by the cache . Slow read speed will definitely slow the programm , especially for random seeks . For dram , write speeds are similar to read speeds . If one was slower and you had symmetrical r/w demands , the lowest would be the bottleneck , since the write cache in a processor is pretty small . <p> i do n't  know much about this but surely dosnt matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more on how the software is done ? ? i know in pics that there is many ways to say flash a led but some ways realy slow down the pic ? so surely software is just a big a part of the speed of a computer ? ? lg <p> My mind runs at 100 mph , but our house has a 20mph speed limit , so I am always in the poo . I am officially GOBBY ! My advice is guaranteed upto the amount you have paid for it . <p> That is true , for example an application made in java or . net will be much slower than something written in C , which will be slower than something hand optimized in assembler , the choice of programming language affects the number of steps involved in calculating a single number . Also the choice of programming paradigms and algorithms will affect the result a lot , but this has little to do with the actual CPU - RAM bottle neck , where RAM bus speed is 5-10 times lower than CPU clock , which leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfers of larger amounts of data into cache rather than directly asking the ram for a single byte each time . <p> Alright then , I think the majority of programs require lot of Read operation and less of Write operation . can you give me the chart specifying the speed of all types of memory in exact .

" and " how can feedback affect the distortion " can anyone answer this for me ? im very curious <p> I will talk about two types of amplifiers. 1 ) Use the transistors in a low gain configuration . Each transistor has low gain and good distortion . This is usually a fast amplifier . ( no feedback ) 2 ) Use the transistors so they have maximum gain and we do n't care about the distortion . The gain might be 10,000. times bigger than we need . Now use feedback to get low gain . ( feedback ) The gain is set by the ratio of two resistors . The non linear effects of the transistors almost disappears because the gain ( with feedback ) is set by resistors not semiconductors . <p> Feedback has no effect on an op amp 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much this noise is amplified at the output . But the signal to noise ratio at the output is basically unaffected since signal and noise are equally amplified . <p> Can you please explain how can feedback affect how much noise is amplified at the output ? And how can feedback reduce the distortion ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> As I stated previously , noise and signal are amplified equally by the amplifier gain so negative feedback has no effect on the signal to noise ratio , only the gain of the signal and noise . <p> Negative feedback , in effect , compares the output with the input . A portion of this difference between the output and the input , ( such as from distortion ) as determined by the feedback factor , is subtracted from the signal , thus reducing the distortion . The greater the feedback factor , the more the distortion is reduced . In a typical op amp circuit configuration , a very large amount of negative feedback is used ( often essentially 100% ) which gives a very low level of distortion at the output .

Second , it will drive down the impedance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will move from about 70 ohms for thin rods to about 50 ohm . This may actual be an advantage if you are feeding with a 50 ohm coax . Lastly the bandwidth of the dipole will widen out , again likely an advantage . <p> If you are putting this in a yagi array , things change significantly . Generally , a yagi drives the input impedance down significantly for driven element but this depends on reflector and director(s) spacing from driven element . Generally , larger diameter rods in a yagi requires the rods to be shortened and brought closer together because inter-element coupling is reduced by the lower impedance , larger diameter rods .

The only way to fix this is to take it apart and replace the thermal fuse with a part that is the same as the old part . Usually the rating is 2 to 3 amps , but it could vary a lot with the size of the fan and manufacturer . You can tell if the fuse is blown because the fan will not even attempt to turn or make any noise . If you ' fling ' the blades with your hand , still nothing ( sometimes that starts them when they are sticking ) . But if the fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't the fuse . <p> Another problem that comes up is the core to core alignment . The core has a top piece and bottom piece and larger midsection . To get the armature out you have to take off either the top or bottom piece or both , and when you put them back together again ( after cleaning and oiling ) sometimes they may not fit exactly together again so you have to jiggle them around a little then tighten the screws a little and try it , then jiggle again and try it , etc. , until finally the alignment is right . This does n't  happen with all fans , but with some fans it does . <p> Another problem that comes up is that the inside of the bearings are really dirty . The only way to clean this is to get something inside the bearing that rubs on all the inside surfaces . I used a dowel that was almost the same diameter as the inside of the bearing , just a little larger , and forced it into the bearing while turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon on the inside bearing surfaces . Once done , it usually made quite a difference on the running of the fan . <p> It 's also a good idea to check the speed of the fan periodically . When it is cleaned it runs fast . You can check it by directing a laser pointer through the fan blades as they are turning , and on the other side have either a solar cell or a cadmium sulfide cell with small battery and resistor . As the fan blades rotate they break the laser beam periodically so you can measure the output of the solar cell ( or photo cell with battery and resistor ) with a frequency counter . You can then compare readings over time to see how the fan is doing after it runs for a few weeks . The actual frequency measured will be higher than the actual rotation speed . To get the rotations per second you divide the measured frequency by the number of fan blades . But you do n't  have to do this if you do n't  want to , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time you check it . You can check your computer fans this way too . 77974 @qwx697974

The DC level at the output of the cap can be shifted to whatever you want with a resistor to the desired bias voltage . The RC time constant of the capacitor and resistor has to be large enough to transfer the lowest AC frequency of interest , of course . 
@@71811858 @511858/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> transformer question <p> I know that you can wire transformers in reverse . Say you have a transformer that goes from 220V on the primary to 110V on the secondary . If you feed it 110V on the secondary you 'll get 220V on the primary . ( correct me if I 'm wrong ) . My question is does the voltage you feed it need to be what it 's rated at or are you mainly concerned with the ratio of the transformer ? For instance , if you have a transformer with a primary voltage of 110V/220V and a secondary of 24V can you only feed the secondary with 24V ? What would happen if you wire 110V to the secondary ? Would you just toast the transformer or if not , what will you get on the primary ? <p> Transformers have pretty good insulatuion that can probably stand up to a couple of thousand volts . Some transformers do n't have enough turns because they are very cheap and thier efficiency does n't matter like in microwave ovens that are used only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . If one of those cheap transformers is used in reverse then it would draw a high current without a load and would get too hot with a load . <p> Some cheap wall-wart transformers also do n't have enough turns and get hot without a load . They would melt if used in reverse . <p> Ok , so if I have a transformer that has a primary of 120V and a secondary of 24V that transformer has a turns ratio of 5:1 , correct ? If I feed 120V into the secondary then I 'll get 600V at the primary . Am I calculating this correctly ? <p> Sorry to keep asking basically the same question . This question came up at work where one of my field techs was told to wire up a transformer that showed 220/110 for primary and 24 for the secondary and another one of my techs told him he could feed 110V and get 220 out but I told him I do n't think he as the right transformer . He did n't have many details on the transformer he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... a transformer that showed 220/110 for primary and 24 for the secondary and another one of my techs told him he could feed 110V and get 220 out but I told him I do n't think he as the right transformer. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> One can actually connects up the transformer in an auto-transformer fashion to obtain a 220V output while feeding in 110V . The turns or voltage on the secondary does not matter and no connection to the secondary is required . <p> The winding ratio here is 1:2 and not 5:1 . You can lookup on autotransformer for more details . <p> Ah , that makes more sense now . So if the primary of a given transformer has inputs on the primary side for 220 and 110 you could put 110 to the center and one end terminal and you 'd get 220 on the two ends and you would n't even need to wire anything to the secondary .

He did n't have many details on the transformer he was trying so his info was a little vague . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Whilst your calculations are correct in a theoretical sense , in practice the transformer would saturate , blowing your input fuse . If you want to run a transformer at a higher than rated voltage , then you need to increase the frequency too - by the same percentage . So if this is a 50Hz transformer then you would need 250Hz <p> Also when you run a transformer backwards , you do not get the correct volts out of the primary , because of regulation . <p> The classic educational models of transformers say things like " a 240V tx with 2400 turns on the primary has 120 turns on the secondary , what is the output ? " and the answer is of course 12V . But that is n't a 12V transformer , unless you specifiy your open circuit volts . <p> In reality a 12V transformer could have 150turns , making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , the voltage drops ( mainly due to resistance ) to 12V . It 's called regulation , and most transformer specs wil list it . <p> so take that same transformer and apply 12v to the secondary 12/150x2400 = 192V and that is open circuit . load it up , and it will probably drop to 150 or so . <p> i am not saying you can not run a transformer backwards , you can . But you need to know the specs of the transformer , in particular the regulation . <p> for a 12v to 230 step up , one with a 9v secondary MAY be a better bet . <p> That was very informative . I knew the basics of transformers and use them often in the normal configuration . Nice to know a little more about other uses for them in unconventional configurations . The issue that prompted me to ask was one of my techs was trying to get 220 from a 110 line . <p> I had a 220VAC fan that would n't run on 110VAC . So I tuned it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about 4.7uF and it ran fine .

If the primary is rated at 120V with the secondary rated at 24V , you must stay within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary with 24V and get 120V out at the primary . However , do not exceed 24V on the secondary . It 's not just the turns ratio that matters , but the magnitude of the voltages as well . <p> Although the insulation is good for a few thousand volts , if the rated voltages are exceeded the core will saturate and the current draw will be destructively large . Driving the 24V secondary with 120V will severely saturate the core and the exciting current will go through the roof . Large power will be dissipated resulting in a large temperature rise and ultimately failure and possibly injury . <p> If you observe the voltage and frequency ratings and work accordingly , you should have no problems . <p> That was very informative .

@@71811859 @511859/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> That is some interesting information . It sorta confirms what I already knew but I though sure it would be more scientific than that . 10 years ago when I was building Tesla Coils we use to put a power transformers in series with the power line and use it as a variable choke to limit the current to the Tesla Coil HV power transformer . When a Tesla Coil = ( TC ) reaches its peak power rating there is no point in putting in more power if you get nothing extra out . A variac or a selector switch to several different load on the secondary will allow different currents to flow in the primary it makes a great variable current choke coil . <p> I did some experementing with different size transformers. 2 identical transformers both 480/240 VAC on the primary and 120 VAC on the secondary both rated 500 watts each have a different saturation point . The smaller transformer may be able to transfer 1KW to the primary and the larger transformer can transfer 2KW . Both transformers would start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5KW transformer as my choke with several 250 watt hot water heating elements as the secondary winding load for 12KW on my large 10 " TC that produces a 27 foot circle of sparks and arcs in my back yard . <p> I am not real sure why a transformer core size should be 2X or 3X larger than it really needs to be that just seems to add extra weight . I can see where 3X or 4X would be great in an Audio Transformer it will allow the peaks to transfer to the secondary coil . <p> A TV speaker should have a variable choke coil used as the volume control then when the advertisements come on 2X louder than the movie the choke will limit the volume = to what the movie sound level was . <p> Another interesting method is to apply a voltage to the primary or maybe even the secondary at the LOWEST desired frequency of operation and look for flat topping . When the flat topping starts to occur , the transformer voltage shouldnt go any higher in voltage than about 80 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know the voltage . Looking at the primary ( or secondary ) wire gauge , we can estimate the max current using 500 or 600 circular mils per amp . Now we know the current . Power is current times voltage , so we would know the max power the primary ( or secondary ) can handle and that tells us the power rating of the transformer . This should work because the designer of a transformer would not want to use a wire gauge that is too much thicker than really required . <p> Note that the voltage test has to be done at the lowest DESIRED frequency of operation . This means even if the transformer was designed for 50Hz if we want to use it at 25Hz we have to test it at that frequency . This is because the max voltage is related to the max flux density which is related to the core cross sectional area , and that also relates to the frequency of operation .

The thing is though , when considering an optimum value for something that depends on other things , we ca n't overlook any of those other things or we 'll either never find the right result or find a result that is not correct . <p> The thing that is missing here is quite common to these initial questions , and that is the internal resistance of the battery or other power source . Without considering that there is no way to optimize anything because after all if you increase the wire diameter with a given voltage even as low as 10 volts you can continue to decrease the wire size and draw more and more current until you have enough of a magnetic field to pull the moon closer to the earth In other words , without considering the battery internal resistance there is no limit to the magnetic field you can generate . <p> Considering the battery internal resistance it then becomes a genuine optimization problem where we try to find the best wire resistance to get the highest level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had talked about this a while back right here on this forum and came to a conclusion about the wire resistance .

Thus , if the battery internal resistance was 1.2 ohms then the best wire resistance is 1.2 ohms . If you care to follow the discussion and the optimization math you can do a search for that thread . We were talking about an electromagnet at the time . <p> But the bottom line is that the internal resistance of the voltage source has a lot to do with the maximization of the field , such that the wire resistance is the resistance that is equal to the resistance of the internal source . In many cases this wont be possible to achieve for practical reasons , so a lighter gauge wire is used with as many turns as fit on the desired coil form . The internal diameter is probably going to be dictated by the desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance then lighter wire with more turns or heavier wire with less turns . Obviously lighter wire with more turns means less current draw from the power source , and somewhat of a slower response to full current . The inductance increases as the square of the turns ratio , so the more turns the larger the inductance grows , and the inductance prevents the full current from appearing through the coil instantaneously . Less turns of heavier wire will mean lower inductance so the speed of response will be faster . The faster the full current ( limited by the resistance ) gets through the coil , the faster the force gets up to maximum .

For this project say it is 12 inch outside diameter with 1/4 inch inside diameter and 12 inches long . The coil build would then be ( roughly ) 5 inches . The coil cross section is therefore a rectangle 12 by 5 inches . We want to fill this area completely with turns of wire so the wire cross section fills that rectangle as much as possible . Given a lighter wire gauge ( small diameter wire ) we would end up with a somewhat high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick diameter wire ) we would end up with a somewhat low total resistance , so the problem then becomes one of finding the best wire gauge to wind the coil form with . We then come up with a formula for the total resistance from the wire diameter , compute the optimum diameter , then look up the wire gauge . If the wire gauge comes out to be too heavy to wire by hand we might look into getting two lengths of wire that have an equivalent cross sectional area and wind them onto the form two in hand ( bifilar ) , and drive the two windings in parallel . <p> Last edited : Jun 7 , 2012 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Obviously lighter wire with more turns means less current draw from the power source , and somewhat of a slower response to full current . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> And therein lies another variable for optimization , the response to full current should match the acceleration the nail to the center of the solenoid . <p> The kid ( college frosh ) at work who 's building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200V capacitors chosen to minimize ESR at 48V ( ? ) ( not sure ) through the solenoid to fire the nail and then charging them at a rate intended to optimize battery life for the impending zombie apocalypse .

I distinctly recall the author explaining how applying pressure with a fingertip to the cone would significantly affect reactance as they swept the audio range . It appeared that the author did a lot of measuring and analyzing . <p> Was trying for a quick and dirty way of getting a better simulation of a speaker aside from an resistor . Never mind though I found a decent spice model that simulates the physical properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx697968 <p> A resistor is probably as helpful as anything else ? , unless you can find an exact spice model for the speaker and cabinet you 're using - but an inductor would be no use at all . <p> I want to feed simulated amplifier output into a simulated speaker to see what kind of results I can expect . It 's just a learning exercise for understanding more complex circuits in spice than just a few basic bits glued together real fast . I 'm not used to dealing with complex electromechanical systems and I 'm learning on my own . After viewing the schematic I understand it a little bit more , there 's a few increasing resistor values right off the bat fed into a parallel array of inductors to give a variable inductance for the voice coil . A couple parasitic capacitors that simulate the actual physical feedback from the cone mass . I found a schematic for LTspice on the Yahoo Groups forum for ltspice It 's attached if anyone wants to see it .

I am working on a project and really need to make RC Filter look " bad " in today 's context , assuming Switch Capacitor is not so commonly used yet . Thanks ! <p> Switched capacitor filters are tuneable by a clock frequency .

But they are very noisy compared to RC because of all the switching . This is the main reason not to use them . <p> Switched capacitor filters are tuneable by a clock frequency .

@@71811864 @511864/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> Very significant advantages . MOSFETs do n't need current on their control pin , but require more voltage . Some do n't turn on fully at 5v , some do . A BJT is limited to something like 0.3v for the lowest voltage drop on the current path , but MOSFETs are only limited by their resistance ( rDSon ) . MOSFETs are usually more efficient switches for power supplies , etc where you want a switch rather than an amplifier . <p> So there are lots of other differences in linearity and high speed performance , but they 're not really straightforward . <p> BJT can handle alot more current and have a lower on-state conduction losses . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Not at all . It 's difficult to compare since you there are large and small BJTs and FETs , so it 's not fair to pick two out of a catalog and compare them . <p> There are many MOSFETs capable of handling quite high currents . <p> On the whole , a BJT will consume more power in the on-state . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it takes a lot of base current to do it . Now there certainly are MOSFETs with poor rDS-on that they exceed a 0.3v drop under load , but that 's hardly a rule . I commonly use MOSFETs with an rDS-on on 0.02 ohms or less . <p> The bipolar 's emitter current can be problematic . If you want an on-state voltage drop of 0.3v at 5 amps , you might need to give it 200mA of base current ( gain is poor as you get into the overdrive region ) . Say it 's a motor and you wanted to meet that spec so it wo n't overheat the transistor or stall the motor when heavily loaded . But most of the time your motors only draw 500mA . Well , unless you 're doing something funky with the driver , you must end up putting in an emitter resistor that always provides 200mA to the base no matter what the load . You ca n't really adjust the current to only the magnitude needed to drive the load at the time . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're sucking 200mA off the 12V supply , or 2.4W , to drive a 500mA load . In practice , you 'd choose a more practical base current and live with the added voltage drop &amp; heat in the BJT . Or the far more practical solution is to use a FET . A FET would take no current on its gate under high or low load and there is no prob finding one with a voltage drop &lt;0.05v under a 5 amp load . There are some awesome switching MOSFETs in SO-8 pkgs that handle high currents without generating significant heat due to such low rDS-on . <p> Also to operate bipolars at high switching frequencies and high current , you have to prevent the devices from going into hard saturation as this will increase storage times ( making it difficult to switch off quickly ) but then cause the device to dissipate more heat due to higher Vce-sat . <p> One place that MOSFETS were proved to be a poor choice is in low distortion audio power amplifiers as indicated in a research by the author " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplifier design .

I do n't think it 's what you want . <p> The LM1875 wants a supply of 16 to 60V or +/- 8 to +/- 30V . If you use single rail supply , like Tony suggested you will get 32V no load and about 24V loaded . this is ok . The disadvantage is that you have to look for a circuit diagram for the amplifier that works on single supply . You will also need large cap for the speaker . I recommend to make a dual rail ( +/- ) supply and use the circuit diagram that is on the datasheet . You can make +/- 18V supply using your 2 transformers 1 bridge of 100V or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need any regulator , they are wast of money and time . LM1875 was designed to work with unregulated supply . If you want circuit diagram for the supply I will draw one for you .

It has a circuit drawing for single unregulated supply . If your preamp is single supply then you are better of with it . <p> There is something else that you have to bear in mind : Tony got all his " like " s for helping people , I got most of mine for telling jokes . Most people over 16 normally listen to music at volume of 50 mW . <p> I have made many audio amplifiers using ICs and never used a voltage regulator . None of them produced hum in the speaker . Why are people talking about 50V supplies and 20W or 22W into an 8 ohm speaker ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak is 17.8V and the full wave bridge rectifier drops it down to 15.8V which is too low for the LM1875 . With a 16V supply a graph shows that its power into an 8 ohm speaker is only 2.5W when it is already clipping a little . 
@@71811866 @511866/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> A solar cell , or photovoltaic cell , is a semiconductor device consisting of a large-area p-n junction diode , which in the presence of sunlight is capable of generating usable electrical energy . This conversion is called the photovoltaic effect , which commonly shortened to PV . <p> Crystalline silicon and gallium arsenide are typical choices of materials for solar cells . Gallium arsenide crystals are grown especially for photovoltaic use , but silicon crystals are available in less-expensive standard ingots , which are produced mainly for consumption in the microelectronic industry . Polycrystalline silicon has lower conversion efficiency but also lower cost where monocrystalline being more cost produces a greater output compared to polycrystalline . <p> Crystalline ingots are sliced into wafer-thin disks then polished to remove any slicing damage , a binder or dopant is introduced into the wafers , and metallic conductors are deposited onto each surface , a thin grid of crystalline on the sun-facing side and usually a flat sheet on the otherside as the wafers are so thin they are very brittle . Solar panels are constructed of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected from radiation and handling damage on the front surface by bonding on a cover glass , and cemented onto a substrate . Electrical connections are made in series-parallel to determine total output voltage . The cement and the substrate must be thermally conductive , because the cells heat up from absorbing infrared energy that is not converted to electricity . Since cell heating reduces the operating efficiency it is desirable to minimize the heating . Solar panel frames are made using usually an aluminum channel to provide air space to cool the panel . <p> TYPES OF SOLAR PANELS <p> Solar panels are made from different types of material to form the P-N junction where some have different properties where the performance varies greatly in the sun . <p> Different Cell Types <p> The three main types of solar panels produced for the world market are polycrystalline , monocrystalline and amorphous .

Amorphous panels are less efficient and the size of the solar panels are greater for the same wattage compared to mono and poly crystalline panels . <p> Amorphous panels also come in higher voltage panels which are suited to grid-tie arrays and where mono and poly crystalline panels lose power output under clouds amorphous panels still produce power . <p> SOLAR PANEL EFFICIENCY <p> The efficiency of the 3 main types of solar panels do vary greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each panel can be wildly varied depending on who you talk to or where you look .

This is a Bose design with two subs integrated in an enclosure . The amp is one channel . The whole amp is 3x3 " and not much to it . <p> I dabble in electronics but never tried to boost the output of an amp . Not sure if this is basically a complete amp redesign or if replacing a few components can make all the difference . Does anyone have enough board level experience to discuss this ? <p> I probably have an amp worth about 0 dollars in the used market so any gamble to improve this system might be considered . I have to wonder how you get 1000w amps if the voltage is so limited ? From the looks of this , my rail voltage would likely be from the drain of each of the two mosfets ? One is positive and the other is negative ? <p> Well , that might be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to no cost , I could possibly get another one like it and either bridge each amp to each speaker or try the configuration you are talking about . <p> I believe I did determine this is a two channel , not a mono amp . there is continuity between the pos of one speaker term and neg of the other term . I would expect to see two pair of matched terminals for a mono design . <p> If that is the case , it might be possible to bridge this amp and get another one like it for the other speaker . Of course this could fail miserable .... <p> the way they get so much wattage is they use a switching supply ( dc-dc converter ) with the required output voltages. for instance , for a 200W ( into 4 ohms ) amp , the converter takes 12V DC , chops it at 50khz or so , and runs the high frequency square wave through a transformer which steps it up , and then through a rectifier and filter , and you get +/-65V out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amp . additional secondary windings and rectifiers provide the +/-12V or +/-15V for the preamp and bass filters . be aware that although only about 7.25A is provided to the speaker ( at 200W ) , the input current to the switching supply is over 16A. it 's actually a bit higher because the power supply 's efficiency is usually 85-90%. such a switching supply is not something for beginners , and will not work well with the amp you already have . you would be better off replacing the subwoofer with one that has a higher sensitivity than the one you currently have . i 'm guessing that a Bose sub probably is rated about 80 to 85db@1W@1 meter . if you replace the sub with one that has a sensitivity of 90 to 95db@1W@1 meter , you have just increased the amount of acoustic power by a factor of 10 , so if your amp is a 10W amp , it would be equivalent to replacing a 10W amp with a 100W amp . <p> The amplifier is probably already two bridged amplifiers producing about 15W at clipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A bridged amplifier IC is inexpensive . You can not bridge it again . The speakers are probably 2 ohms each and are in series then make a " one-note-bass " sound at resonance ( like a bongo drum ) since in series the extremely low output impedance of the amplifier can not damp their resonance . <p> actually , i think it may be worse than that .... in a bridged amp , the output Z 's of the two amplifiers are in series and floating , which reduces the damping factor to 1/2 of a single amp . a typical TDA amp chip has an output impedance around 500-800 milliohms. bridged , this would be 1 to 1.6 ohms . DF is Zl/Zout , so with a 4 ohm load DF is between 3 and 4 ... very poor , and the sub 's cabinet resonance will dominate the sound , and that 's why there 's so much " one-note-bass " . class D amps also have generally poor damping factors . <p> actually , i think it may be worse than that .... in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplifiers are in series and floating , which reduces the damping factor to 1/2 of a single amp . a typical TDA amp chip has an output impedance around 500-800 milliohms. bridged , this would be 1 to 1.6 ohms. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Why do you think the output impedance is so high ? The amplifiers have a very high open-loop gain and TONNES of negative feedback . <p> I think each of the two amplifiers has an output impedance of 40 milliohms or less . Then a speaker 's or its cabinet 's resonance is very well damped even if the total of two bridged amplifiers is 80 milliohms . <p> Remember the poor damping of speakers by an old vacuum tube amplifier ? Some guitar speakers have two speakers connected in series and are driven by a vacuum tube amplifier for a very boomy sound . Maybe on purpose since the speakers did not produce bass sounds anyway . <p> you 're right .... i calculated the output resistance , not the output impedance .... the output impedance is the output resistance divided by the gain margin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . cheap amp chips do n't have a large open-loop gain ( about the same as a 741 ) , so their distortion is relatively high and damping factor relatively low . <p> you 're right .... i calculated the output resistance , not the output impedance .... the output impedance is the output resistance divided by the gain margin . still the damping factor wo n't be all that great . cheap amp chips do n't have a large open-loop gain ( about the same as a 741 ) , so their distortion is relatively high and damping factor relatively low . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> The keyword there is ' relatively ' <p> Distortion is low and damping factor high , both will far exceed what 's needed . <p> The importance of damping factor is also greatly exaggerated here , with series/parallel connection of multiple speakers making no audible difference . <p> However , this does n't help the OP - he needs a completely new amplifier , there 's nothing he can do to ' upgrade ' the existing one .

Alpine amps on the other hand are usually pretty close to the edge of their published specs ( usually a few watts shy of spec at 13.8V ) , but both companies specify their wattage at 14.4V. as for " off brand " amps , i agree , their " whattage " ratings are exaggerated ( AG , i hope you do n't mind i borrowed your term for bogus specs ? ) . any manufacturer that says something like " 300 watts @ 10% THD " , avoid them like the plague ... what that really means is more like " 270 watts @1% THD with a 40 MPH tailwind , on a tuesday " ... <p> Peak Power or Maximum Power are terms that are used by cheap amplifiers and speakers . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are playing square-waves at full blast ( Acid Rock " music " ) . <p> Frequently the spec 's for a cheap amplifier or speaker do not say " continuous power " because full power output is only momentary before the amplifier or speaker overheats and/or before the power supply voltage sags . <p> I once saw a car kitted out with a 1000W RMS system at a Motor Show . The wiring was impressively huge with several 1 Farad Caps to smooth the input supply from an extra huge battery and a seriously uprated alternator . All combined with a switchmode PSU about the size of .... erm another smaller car in the boot . It had and probably needed a 4 litre engine with about 2BHP once the stereo was switched on . <p> How anyone would/could listen to anything over 1watt in a car is beyond me . <p> I agree with previously posters and often seen on PC speakers systems . 1000W Peak Music Output Power from a plastic speaker and a power supply no larger than a tin of beans .

It is advertised at 150W but inside its little power transformer is labelled 9VAC/1.1A which is 9.9W . Its amplifiers are about 50% efficient so its full output power is probably only 5W . <p> My first job was with Philips repairing car radios on the production line . Then I was quickly promoted to engineering new car radios . The first car radio had no ICs and the output transistors were complimentary power germanium types .

@@71811869 @511869/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> what is the function of an oscillator within an inverter circuit ? <p> This may seem like a stupid question , I thought I knew the answer to this but I think there is more than one answer to it and the question is to " clearly explain the function of an oscillator within an inverter circuit " My initial thought was that it provides commutation to switch on and off switches alternatively like thyristors for example . However I know that it 's possible to create a true sinewave using positive feedback although this is very difficult so I know there is a big gap in my knowledge so may'be someone can think of another reason for oscillations ? I ca n't think of another one at the moment . <p> The electricity in your home is AC at 60Hz in North America or 50Hz elsewhere . It is a sine-wave . <p> An inverter uses the power from a huge battery to create 50Hz or 60Hz at the same voltage as the electricity in your home but the waveform can be a square-wave for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work from it , or the waveform can be a modified sinewave that is a little more complicated but nearly all products work from it , or the waveform can be a pure sine-wave which is made with a complicated circuit . <p> The oscillator in the inverter creates the 50Hz or 60Hz . <p> If you use a sine-wave oscillator driving a linear power amplifier then the amplifier wastes a lot of power as heat . The battery current is double what a modern circuit would be . A modern sine-wave inverter uses a high frequency voltage stepup circuit that has a tiny transformer and a rectifier to make high voltage DC . Then another high frequency high voltage circuit uses pulse-width-modulation to create a stepped sine-wave then a small high frequency filter smooths the steps into a pure sine-wave . The parts that operate at high frequency barely get warm because they switch on and off . <p> Also not that if you 're going to build an inverter or design an electrical system that uses one like a UPS or alternative energy supply use as high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that to transmit the more power you need to increase either the current or the voltage . Increasing the current leads to large losses in the cables which will need to be thick bulky and expensive . I 'd strongly recommend using 48V as it 's too low to electricute you ( unless you have really damp skin so keep away from water ) and the current that delivers the same power is one quarter of that at 12V. 77972 @qwx697972 77975 @qwx697975 <p> Try Wikipedia , look up Inverter .

@@71811872 @511872/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> For every 400 turns on the primary , you will put 80 turns on the secondary . All the other data is for other calculations . Your transformer may need 1 turn per volt and this will require 400 turns and 80 turns on the secondary . It may need 5 turns per volt 2000 turns to 400 turns or it may need 10 turns per volt . 4,000 turns to 800 turns The answer is always the same ratio of primary to secondary turns . In all cases you will get 80v out of the transformer . <p> The transformer has primary voltage Vp at the terminals of 400v , secondary voltage Vs of 80v with full load , and primary current with full load Ip and secondary current Is with full load . <p> One way to handle the transformer with primary and secondary resistances is to simply subtract the voltage dropped by the primary current and primary resistance from the primary voltage and use that as the new primary voltage , then add the voltage dropped by the secondary resistance and secondary current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage , then take the ratio of the new secondary voltage to the new primary voltage and that will be the turns ratio required . <p> If we formulize this process it comes out to this : A= ( Vs+Is*Rs ) / ( Vp-Ip*Rp ) where A is the turns ratio primary to secondary , and because this is a step down transformer you can take 1/A to be the turns ratio here , and Vs is the secondary voltage , and Vp is the primary voltage , and Is is the secondary current , and Ip is the primary current , and Rp is the primary resistance , and Rs is the secondary resistance . <p> Example : We have 400v input and we want 80v output with load , and the primary resistance is 1.5 ohms and secondary resistance is 0.1 ohm , and the full load VA is 4kVA . <p> The primary current is Ip=4000/400 . The secondary current is Is=4000/80 . The primary resistance Rp=1.5 ohms . The secondary resistance Rs=0.1 ohms . The primary voltage Vp is 400 volts . The secondary voltage Vs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A= ( Vs+Is*Rs ) / ( Vp-Ip*Rp ) <p> we come out with : A= ( 80+50*0.1 ) / ( 400-10*1.5 ) <p> and after doing the math we get : A=0.22077922 <p> which is the primary to secondary turns ratio , and the secondary to primary turns ratio is simply 1/A which is : 1/A=4.52941176 <p> There is one more little catch here however , and that is that there is always some primary excitation current . To get more accurate results , we 'd have to look up the excitation current from the manufacturers data sheet and figure that in as an additional voltage drop on the primary side . <p> Colin : The turns ratio actually is usually made a little higher to make up for the loss of the primary and secondary resistances . The formula above takes these two resistances into account . <p> Last edited : Sep 6 , 2010 77974 @qwx697974 <p> 99.9% of the time ideal calculation are close enough for the device to work they way you want it to under ' real ' conditions . if you want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vs=80v then you best bet is to measure the input and output voltages and adjust the coils .

Strictly the node a is not floating , and there is no issue finding a mathematical solution . However numerical solutions can be problematic . An integrator is marginally stable and the added parasitic resistor makes the system stable and amenable to a reliable numerical solution . Consider that the slightest offset in the input sine wave would cause the error to get integrated . It might diverge in the positive direction or in the negative direction . <p> It is usually the DC status of a node that triggers an error like this so if you had say just two capacitors connected in series with the two open ends connected to DC sources it might complain that the common node was " open circuit " or some other complaint like " node n has no DC path to ground " . <p> In your case it could be happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a source that might be considered an infinite resistance for DC current , so that may trigger the complaint .

First , can we make/produce a " pure " sinusoidal current source without any DC offsets in real life ? <p> In the above circuit , there seems no current flowing into the capacitor in steady state , all the AC current flows through the DC voltage source V3 , even I raise the frequency to 10K Hz . Is it because the impedance of the DC voltage source is much smaller compared to that of the cap ? Or is it because the cap is already " fully charged " , the only way for the current to flow is through the DC voltage source ? <p> You are quibbling ( look up the word ) about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin ( look that up , too ) . <p> In the current-source driving a capacitor circuit , in the real world , it is impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shunting it , or that does n't have a dc offset . It is impossible to build a capacitor that does n't have some internal DC leakage . <p> In the current-source driving a capacitor circuit in parallel with a voltage source , it your lack of understanding of KVL is causing your confusion . The impedance of an ideal voltage source is zero , so the voltage across the capacitor will be 1mV , regardless of the what the current source is doing . <p> A simulation is only as good as how the circuit you enter models reality . Reality dictates that capacitor and/or current source be shunted with a high , but finite resistance . Put it in explicitly with PSpice , or let LtSpice put it in for you ... 77970 @qwx697970 <p> As we were saying , it could be just because the program is written to not allow any node to exist without a DC path to ground so that it wont ever be able to develop an infinite voltage , but you could try connecting a large resistor across the cap to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the starting condition of a zero voltage across the cap when there is zero current through it and it 's driven by a sine source . This results in a response not of a pure sine wave , but as : 1-cos(t*w) times 1/ ( w*c ) . So we end up with a DC offset across the cap with a sine source . Maybe it does n't  like that . The wave 1-cos(t*w) times any constant is a wave that is always above zero , not a sine wave . <p> I do n't  think you can build a pure sine wave current source with just passive components , but with active components you could build something that resembles this very closely . For example , if you had a source with non zero offset and you connect a large capacitor in series with it the capacitor will remove most of the DC offset , except for the leakage of the cap . Alternately , you could put a DC current source in parallel with the sinusoidal source and control the DC current source with feedback from measuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low . The precision would then depend on the precision of the control circuit . Back in the 1980 's when i worked in the industry we actually had to do something like this with a synthesized sine converter design , where the slightly non symmetrical PWM input to the transformer would cause a DC offset current and that would push the operating point of the transformer up along the BH curve of the core , and that would cause operation that was closer to saturation for some points in the drive wave which in turn would cause more audible noise ( audible noise is more of a problem with high power converters and many people did not want to sit in the same room with some of them ) . <p> So you might do a few experiments to see what is really causing the problem with your simulation , but in the end if you can solve it without affecting the circuit too much then you should be happy .

That is since P = 1/T * Gv(t)*i(t) dt . <p> I do n't  mind doing this hard work , but do you know any practical way to calculate the area under v(t)*i(t) ? <p> To Bill , Our budget is very limitted at this stage , and besides , since I mostly deal with SW issues on these days , I 'd love to utilize any HW issue that comes into my hands . The oscilloscope is n't a DSO . <p> you remind me that when I was a kid , I connected two cans to a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second can at a friend 's home , and all other kids called me a cheapskate . <p> Its much more thrilling to acheive your goal with your own hands than pressing some buttons and let it do it for you . <p> Anyhow , I 'd really like to learn how is it possible to measure the true power of a SMPS . I 'm sure people do it using only an oscilloscope , and i 'd like to be capable of doing it myself . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> While you are sitting there figuring out how to get the most thrill , your company is losing money . THis is a job , not a hobby so efficiency outweights thrill-factor . <p> If you have a current probe for your meter , you might connect one channel as current , the other channel for voltage and have the meter multiply the two for you and then sit there and work out all the kinks . I doubt they have a oscilloscope current probe though ... those things costs even more than power quality analyzers . <p> I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only measuring tools I have here are Fluke and digital oscilloscope . I heard by an engineer that used to work around here that it is possible to measure the true power of an SMPS using a ' scope . <p> I fully understand the waveform of the current drawn from the mains , which you described - current spikes that charge the capacitor to the voltage peak ( 310VDC in the case of 220VAC mains ) . <p> Connect a second , large electro cap in parallel with your first electro cap , then put a 1 ohm resistor in series between them . Measure the current by the voltage drop on the 1 ohm resistor and the voltage by the voltage on the second cap . <p> Assuming the 2 caps are large enough you will be able to measure input power within a few percent accuracy as the AC ripple on the 1 ohm resistor is very small and is averaged on your multimeter . You can even add a volt for the voltage drop of the rectifier diode , that might get you within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 . You 're actually saying that I can treat the current that comes from the capacitor as DC current , and the voltage on that capacitor as DC voltage ; and then you get P = I * V . Did i get you right ? <p> 2 . I just do n't  quite understand why do you suggest to connect a large capacitor in parallel with the existing one ? Is it only to decrease the ripple current and voltage , and therefore being able to measure the true power as the product of two DC components ( I and V ) with better proximity ? <p> 3 . Moreover , adding this large capacitor will only increase the apparent power that the SMPS consumes from the power plant , but wo n't change the true power the SMPS consumes from the power plant , right ? <p> 4 . Why did you say the connect the resistor between the two capacitors , and not after them ? we do n't  care about the current that 's going to the capacitors , but only the current that 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood your method right , then its a really good one , it relays on the fact that Pin = Pout ( where Pin is the power that the power plant provides , and Pout is the power that the capacitor provides ) . The capacitor itself also requires power from the power plant , but its reactive power therefore we do n't  need to measure it . So I wonder why i was suggested to measure areas of curves which is such a hard work . 
@@71811879 @511879/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> high frequency content in rising and falling edges , data rate and bandwidth , etc . <p> Q1 : It is said that rising and falling edges , such as those of square wave , imply high frequency content . What does in really mean ? For example , periodic square , sawtooth and triangular waves , all three have infinite number of harmonics of the fundamental frequency extending to infinity , so all three have high frequency content . Right ? But a square wave has rising and falling edges which are more vertical than those of other two , so this should mean that a square has higher frequency content than the other two . But all three have harmonics extending to infinity . Please help me with this . <p> This is the reason I can think of . Although the harmonics extend to infinity but higher harmonics can be ignored without actually affecting the waveform because they have such a small amplitude . Let 's take the case of a square and sawtooth waves . Perhaps , in case of a sawtooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ignoring the harmonics above 1000 Hz for a square wave will greatly affect the shape of the waveform . <p> Q3 : In analog communication a medium should be able to support at least that much bandwidth as is required by a signal . For instance , suppose that we want to send the an audio baseband signal ( speech and music ) by a wire instead of transmitting it using AM then this would require that the wire at least support 5 kHz bandwidth . So , for analog communication the rule is simply that the medium should be able to support the bandwidth required by a baseband signal . <p> In case of digital communication the bandwidth is given in terms of data rate ( bits per second ) . For example , if data rate is 500 bps , it means that the medium can ' transport ' five hundred bits from one place to another in one second . The Shannon formula gives us relationship between bandwidth ( range of frequencies ) supported by a medium and data rate supported by it . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more number of bits in one second ) then you need to have more bandwidth assuming signal to noise ratio remains constant . What 's the underlying reason for this relationship ? <p> If I had been asked to explain this , I would go like this . ( Please first note that my whatever I 'm going to say is based on my reasoning given in last paragraph of Q1 . If my reasoning is not correct there then whatever I 'm going to say is n't also correct . ) <p> For the sake of starting this discussion assume that a periodic square wave is used to send the bits ( periodicity means that bits are sent like this 010101010101010101 ) . When amplitude of the square wave is " 1 " it means bit " 1 " and when amplitude is " -1 " it stands for bit " 0 " . Now please have a look here . Do you agree with me ? <p> In almost all practical situations the sequence of bits in non-periodic and it is represented by non-periodic square wave . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large bandwidth . In other words , they always have significant higher harmonics . The more non-periodicity or randomness there is , the more bandwidth is required . We kind of say that the amount of non-periodicity or randomness is proportional to the required bandwidth . Do you think what I say is generally true ? <p> You might find links #3 and #4 helpful for this question . <p> Q4 : What 's the relationship between bandwidth and noise ? Does the noise decrease when bandwidth is decreased ? In SSB-SC amplitude modulation , it is said that SSB-SC uses less bandwidth compared to DSB-SC therefore it accounts for less noise . I do n't understand the reason for this relationship . <p> For Q1 i think you have it right . Looking at it mathematically ( as we should almost always do anyway ) we find that the square wave has harmonics that are 1/n where n is the harmonics number 1,3,5,7,9 , etc. , all the odd guys . The triangle wave however has harmonics that are 1/n2 . So except for the first harmonic , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding harmonics in the square wave . So no matter how many we look at we will see less content in the triangle wave . <p> Let 's take a quick look at a particular harmonic , number n=9 ... <p> The square wave amplitude is 1/9 , while the triangle amplitude is 1/81 . That 's quite a bit different even though we are only at harmonic number 9 . The triangle wave content is much lower . In decimals the square wave content is 0.11111111 while the triangle is 0.012345679 , so that 's a pretty big difference . So if we used a sharp low pass filter we would see a bigger difference in the square wave than the triangle wave . This means if we have a bandwidth limited media we should see less effect for the triangle . <p> Put another way that is also practical , if we have a square wave that is nearly perfect with very fast rise and fall times , if we want to limit the frequency content we would try to get those rise and fall times to ' slant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they take on the appearance more of a triangle ramp than a square wave sharp rise or fall . That helps reduce radiated EMI which helps get past certain required government compliance tests . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> The triangle still looks pretty much the same with only the first 11 odd harmonics , while the square wave looks distorted . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Q2a : It is generally true , but I would guess that you can find some interesting exceptions to the general rule . <p> Q2b : Is more than generally true . It is always true . <p> Q3 : This question has so much in it that it almost becomes a loaded question . It 's hard to answer without saying something that is not quite right . I 'll give more thought on the right way to answer , and I probably have to look up some things I forgot . Damned , if I could just remember all the things I 've learned , I 'd be a pretty smart guy . <p> Q4 : Noise and bandwidth are generally related because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically noise can be reduced by deliberately filtering out frequencies that are not needed because they are outside of the band required by the signal you care about .

But do n't you think this text is suggesting that the more bandwidth you use , the more reduction there is in noise ? I thought I should clear this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point I would like to clear . Mostly modulation is taken to be shifting of a frequency spectrum of a baseband signal to some higher value spectrum . Can modulation also be taken to be shifting of a baseband spectrum to some lower value spectrum ? Radio waves have frequencies from 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz . Suppose , the baseband signal exists in the range 250-251 GHz . Can we use 220 GHz carrier in this case ? Thank you . <p> Regards PG 77964 @qwx697964 <p> You could actually do the rise and fall times separately and that would show you the difference in harmonic content for just those places in the wave . A ramp with variable slope computed for harmonic content for example . This would show how increasing the ramp slope ( and thus getting closer and closer to a perfect square wave rise or fall ) increases the high order harmonic content . I might do this myself just for illustration if i get a chance . <p> BTW , when we say " Harmonic Content " sometimes we mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and we do n't  specify how great each one is , but usually what we mean when we say " Harmonics from 3 to 103 " is that the harmonics are significant in amplitude . So the real meaning is a little ambiguous and so a little experience is required sometimes . <p> For example , we can say that both the square wave and triangle wave have " all the odd harmonics " but notice we did n't  really specify how high in amplitude they were until the question came up as to which one has the greater harmonic content . Then we were forced to reconcile with a comparison of each harmonic in each wave case and we found that whatever harmonic we look at the square wave always had a higher amplitude . So what this boils down to mathematically is at first we seem to imply that they both have something the same about them , and they do ( roughly shown as ) : ContentSW=ContentTW=all the odd harmonics <p> but then to really compare them we have to state something like this : LONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m might be 0 or 1 , we 'd have to check the fundamental amplitude for each wave . <p> So the way we were able to find this was to compare each harmonic amplitude of the two cases . If we had a more complex wave however then we 'd have to resort to what is called the " Total Harmonic Distortion " of the wave , and compare that , and make some concessions about what we were accepting and not accepting according to the application 's demands . <p> Also , when we say " It increases the high order harmonic content " we do n't  necessarily mean that it adds MORE harmonics , it might ( and usually does ) mean that those harmonics where already there but now they are even higher in amplitude than before . Thus , if we say that a particular action increased the harmonic content that might mean that the 11th through 21st harmonics went up from what they were before that action took effect . So there could be times when we mean that more harmonics were actually introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.3 , but usually it means that say the 11th harmonic was 0.02 or something and now it is 0.3 or so . We would probably be prone to explain in more detail why a totally new harmonic was introduced though if it was never present before . <p> Last edited : Sep 7 , 2013 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Okay .

Honestly , this is an advance method , and I 'm rusty on the theory of this . i have n't studied this for a couple of decades . This is similar to the old spread spectrum techniques . The idea is to spread the signal across a wide band , much larger than what is needed for the signal . Theory then says that you can sacrifice your frequency band for better SNR . Rather than trying to brush up on this and restate it , I 'll just refer you to this link . <p> MrAl : Thank you for getting back to that topic with more detail . At the moment I ca n't pursue that topic in more detail . But after reading your reply my understanding has improved . As a matter of fact , your two posts at the start had cleared my confusion quite enough . <p> Q1 : Steve : So , do n't you think that these are two contradictory statements ? In statement #1 , it is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #2 it is said that increasing the bandwidth decreases the noise .

Suppose , the baseband signal exists in the range 250-251 GHz . Can we use 220 GHz carrier in this case ? Thank you . <p> Q1 : I would n't say those ideas are contradictory , but I would say that the advanced wideband modulation schemes based on Shannon 's Information Theory is somewhat counter-intuitive at first . I remember studying spread-spectrum techniques using coding 25 years ago in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it actually makes perfect sense . But again , the details have faded from my mind . I ca n't say all wideband technique are as intuitive because I have n't studied them . <p> Q2 : Generally , you do n't want to do this . The resulting spectrum can in principle still have the baseband information in it , but I 'm not sure how you would demodulate it . Still , I ca n't say for sure that nobody has n't played around with this idea . People try all kinds of crazy things . <p> Q1 : My query is an extension to Q1 from post #1 above . MrAl told me that my thinking was correct . <p> It was said that rising and falling edges , such as those of square wave , imply high frequency content . Is there an intuitive explanation possible for this ? Why would rising and falling edges imply high frequency content ? Thanks . <p> Q2 : I had been under the impression that FT of a function , either time-limited or not , will contain frequencies extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their small amplitudes . This is the case with FS too where every periodic function has frequencies extending to infinity . <p> I understand that coming up with an exact answer is n't possible in this discussion so I want to know your general opinion . <p> In case of FT I think I had it wrong all along because I had solved at least one problem where a time-unlimited sinc function had FT as a frequency-limited rectangular function ; the frequencies did n't extend to infinity . What is your general statement about time-unlimited functions and the frequencies contained in their FT ? Do n't you think most of the time their frequencies extend to infinity ? <p> Can a time-limited function have a FT with limited frequencies ? Thank you . <p> Q1 : I 'm not sure of a good intuitive explanation if the idea is n't already intuitive to you . For me , it is so intuitive , that I never thought about it too much . In some sense , you might say that a sharp edge is the only possible with high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creating a fast transition . But , I do n't  ' know if that will help you at all . <p> Q2 : It sounds like you discovered on your own that it is possible for a time unlimited signal to have a frequency limited FS or FT . The sinc function is a good example of a non0periodic signal and a simple sine wave is an example of a periodic one . A time limited signal should always require infinite frequency , unless it 's a trivial case ( f(t)=0 for example ) or some type of exotic signal that a mathematician might look at but has no practical value ( I 'm not aware of any of these , but I just mention it because those crazy math guys invent all kinds of things that make no sense to me ) . <p> Q2 : It sounds like you discovered on your own that it is possible for a time unlimited signal to have a frequency limited FS or FT .

I do n't think it 's true that every time-unlimited non-periodic signal ( sinc function is a non-periodic time unlimited signal ) is always going to have a frequency limited spectrum ? In my opinion , majority of time-unlimited non-periodic signals will have unlimited frequency spectrum . Thanks . <p> It should n't be a matter of opinion . You are making a statement than can be easily proved by examples . Please provide some example of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actually I was n't able to come up with any example . So , in a way , I was requesting you to let me know of any simple example , if possible . But now I will review some of the stuff later . Thanks . <p> All you have to do really is remember that when you know the harmonics and amplitudes of the wave to recreate that wave in the time domain you must add the sinusoidal components together to get that wave again in the time domain . This constant awareness of what is happening in the frequency domain and what is happening in the time domain is the key to understanding this . <p> If we look at the first harmonic of say a 1Hz square wave with amplitude 1 , we find that it is just a 1Hz sine wave with amplitude a bit higher than 1 . If we plot these two with the square wave on the top graph and the sine wave on the bottom graph we see that they both go through zero at the same points in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when one goes negative the other goes negative also . So they follow each other in step more or less even though the shapes are different . <p> But what we notice when we compare them this way is that the sine wave of the same frequency as the square wave takes a LOT longer to rise to the peak , while the square wave rises immediately to the peak . Now if we had two or more 1Hz sine waves of different phases and we added them together , we could NEVER produce a steep rising front like the square wave has . That is because of the basic way that sine waves add together . <p> When we add a higher non infinite frequency harmonic to the fundamental however ( or even just look at a higher harmonic by itself ) we see right away that the wave has the innate ability to RISE FASTER than the fundamental . There is still a limit because it 's a sine wave of non infinite frequency , but now the charge in the wave can occur much faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the time domain with a sine wave that is of a higher harmonic that allows us to force a change in the final wave such as the square wave . By adding the higher harmonic , we get a fast rising wave front and that is why we end up with high harmonic content in the square wave . If we limit this to some finite values like say 1000Hz , then that means that we limit the rise time of the square wave to some value that is slower than a true square wave . If we triple that limit to 3000Hz , then we ( probably ) decrease the rise time by 1/3 of what it was before ( although i did not compute this it should follow some rule like that or similar ) . But since we need a rise time that is zero , we would need a frequency that is very very high to allow us to force that fast of a change in the time domain . In fact for a pure square wave it would have to be infinite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , we find that there is no real square wave only a squarish wave that is almost a true square wave and the fronts rise very quickly but not in zero time . <p> The best way to comprehend this is to do a few simple experiments with a graphing calculator or on the computer in a graphing program . Start with a fundamental like 1H and add different harmonics and see how the initial rise time decreases . Note that eventually you reach the limit of the graphics to display a ramp and it starts to look like it has a zero rise time . To truly understand this you just have to take the time to do stuff like this . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Actually I was n't able to come up with any example . So , in a way , I was requesting you to let me know of any simple example , if possible . But now I will review some of the stuff later . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Ah OK , I did n't realize you were asking for examples . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , majority of time-unlimited non-periodic signals will have unlimited frequency spectrum . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Essentially , I agree with your statement . Saying " majority " is questionable because you are dealing with an infinite number of each type . But , let 's just say " the majority of practical idealized time-unlimited non-periodic signals have unlimited frequency spectrums " . <p> Now , we need to qualify that , in practice , we can approximate these band-unlimited signals by band-limited versions that have limited frequency spectra . Hence , this is just a discussion of principles . <p> Simplest examples are , impulse , pulse and step . <p> Now , let 's use some math tricks to say something powerful that can bolster your statement even more . <p> Take any signal , whether band limited or band unlimited . At some point in time T where the signal is nonzero , place a step function there to turn that signal off before that point in time and make the signal zero for t&lt;T and unmodified for t&gt;T . Such a signal will be band unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn signals on and off abruptly . So , mathematically how can I prove what I just said . That 's simple . The signal can be represented as the step signal u(t-T) multiplied by the original signal x(t) . Well , multiplication in the time domain transforms as convolution in the frequency domain . Hence , it follows that since u(t-T) is band unlimited , then the multiplication of u(t-T) x(t) is also band unlimited because the convolution of an infinite frequency range in the frequency domain with any other spectrum ( whether band limited or band unlimited ) will give a band unlimited spectrum . <p> There are a lot of exceptions . For every infinite bandwidth signal , you can make an infinite number of finite bandwidth approximations to that signal , by chopping all frequencies above a certain value . You can also make an infinite number of infinite bandwidth approximations to those signals by applying a first order low pass filter at a particular cutoff frequency . In that case the upper frequencies are attenuated heavily , but they are not zero in theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filter , or a third order , etc. and still you would have in infinite bandwidth signal in each case . <p> This is why the word ' majority ' is a bit imprecise , but I 'm sure you get the idea now . <p> It sounds to me like you are trying to categorize every signal under the sun and then examine the result to see if there is some trend with respect to the bandwidth of these signals . <p> If you are going to do that then the first thing you have to do is create a big division between real signals and theoretical signals . <p> Theoretical signals can contain almost any frequency component including what we might call infinite , but real signals always appear bandlimited because the higher frequency components do not pass through anything without at least some frequencies being attenuated even though these may be the very highest ones . <p> Aside from that though it is very hard to do this i think because no matter what signal we are using who says that the next guy that comes along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the ones we had been using all along . In specific applications there may be a tendency to use the same signals but i think it is hard to specify something like this that has to cover every possible application . <p> There are applications that use simple sine waves for test signals and applications that use square waves for test signals . A linear circuit will pass this information while a non linear circuit could very well introduce higher harmonics . The theoretical non linear circuit could produce an infinite number of harmonics , while the real life circuit could produce a large number of harmonics but not an infinite number . <p> ADDED : We can say that a signal that originates as a theoretical signal and travels through a theoretical linear medium gets attenuated according to the medium 's filter function and so the higher harmonics will still remain just at a reduced amplitude , but if that same signal is put through a real medium i am not sure we can still say this because the real medium will probably attenuate some of the signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will mask these lowest levels . <p> Last edited : Jan 10 , 2014 77974 @qwx697974

Or just a straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 50 amps in future applications ? Solder over a copper trace ai n't gon na get it there , period . Think vaporized traces . I do n't care what the initial calculations say , I 've seen **** like it happen . I 've been doing electronics R&amp;D for 3 years now , including power stuff . Solder over a trace is considered a half-assed fix for when you ****ed up your board design and need to get the prototpye working until you can do another board spin . I do n't know if it even meets IPC standards . I doubt it , because I 've never seen it done in professional electronics . <p> I do n't know how gooder conductor silver solder is compared to copper . I know silver is a better conductor than copper but silver solder is n't pure silver . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Unless you 're talking about the jewelry solder , silver bearing solder for electronics is only like 2% silver , with the balance being either pure tin and a smidge of copper ( abbreviated as SAC for SnAgCu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good old American stuff . The silver solder in jewelry making is mostly silver but is way high temperature stuff , would probably ruin a PCB in no time flat trying to solder with it . <p> It 's true that regular solder has much less conductivity than copper , so that a copper trace of a certain width and thickness covered with a layer of regular solder that has the same width and thickness would carry only about 10 percent more current , but only if the electrical conductivity was the only thing to consider here , but there is another consideration . The electrical conductivity is about 10 times less than copper , and unfortunately the thermal conductivity is also about 10 times less than copper . This means when we coat a trace of copper with solder in addition to lowering the resistance we are also decreasing the trace 's ability to dissipate heat by covering it with a ( somewhat ) heat insulator . The ability of the trace to dissipate heat has a lot to do with it 's current carrying capability , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily decrease it 's ability to conduct current . Since the copper trace has a fiber or glass backing , when already one side of the trace is covered by a pseudo heat insulator , and the edges are not thick enough to have much impact on the heat dissipation , so when we cover the top with another pseudo heat insulator ( albeit a somewhat poorer one though ) we are again reducing the ability of the trace to dissipate heat and thus lowering it 's ability to conduct current . <p> Just what is the overall impact then , having one parameter lower the resistance and the other decrease the heat dissipation factor ? The conductance of each trace ( one being copper and the other solder ) would be combined and then the temperature rise of the copper and solder combination would have to be calculated knowing the thermal conductivity is about 10 times less for solder , and that could be compared to copper alone . With only one ' layer ' of solder ( a ' layer ' being the same thickness as the copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the temperature rise , and multiple layers may or may not help the situation until some break point where the sides of the trace begin to have a more significant effect by adding significantly to the total dissipation surface area . It 's hard to predict this action exactly though . <p> So how about a simpler way to deal with all these variables ? Luckily , there is a way ... One way for example would be to etch a trace say 6 to 12 inches long on a scrap piece of PC board material that is the same type to be used with the final circuit . Next we would attach terminals to each end and run a DC test current through the trace . We would then measure the current through the trace and measure voltage drop . Knowing the voltage drop and current , we would calculate resistance . Next we would cover the trace with a layer of solder , then test again and compare results . A third test might be to try apply a heavy load of solder and then measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to pass for the trace to heat up to equilibrium before a measurement is made , and that it would be best to use the actual max current for the test that will be found in the actual application . It will certainly not work to use a small test current like 1ma , but the full 10 or 20 amps if that is what is needed for the finished circuit . A DC meter able to measure down to 1uv would be a good idea too , and it that is n't good enough than the test trace will have to be lengthened . <p> Silver solder comes in something like 2 percent to 4 percent for electrical use i think , and i 'm not sure that that will decrease the resistance very much . One of the reasons for using that solder is because it flows better than regular solder and probably adheres better too ... better conductivity is probably over stated for this kind of product . <p> Another variable is the surface condition of the added solder .

I would request you to have another look here . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flux linking the coil is maximum but the induced voltage is zero , and in " ( b ) " the flux linking the coil is zero but the induced voltage is maximum . What is this " flux linking the coil " ? Thank you . <p> The flux linking the coil is the flux that actually goes through the wires in the coil . The flux is what moves the electrons in the wire because of the motion . There is flux that does n't  link the coil , and that 's the flux that is not penetrating . So if we had a large field and a small coil only part of the field lines would actually go through the coil . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Either I have it totally wrong or you are n't getting what I 'm asking for . I have a feeling that the latter is true ! <p> In the picture below , do you think there is less flux linking the coil in " ( b ) " or as , as you say , less flux is penetrating the coil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily see that more flux is penetrating the coil in " ( b ) " than in " ( a ) " but still flux linkage is maximum in " ( a ) " and zero in " ( b ) " . Let me elaborate it a bit . In " ( a ) " you have a horizontal wall in path of the flux but in " ( b ) " you have a vertical wall erected in path of the flux flow . Obviously , the vertical wall provides more obstruction to the flow of flux than the horizontal wall . Now please help me . Thank you . <p> If i understand you correctly , the thing is we have to take the motion of the wire relative to the field into consideration too . For a small change in angle in ( a ) the wire at the top of the coil is moving tangent to the B field , or parallel ( but in the other direction ) . For a small change in angle in ( b ) the wire at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ( a ) ) is moving perpendicular to B. So in B we see the force is perpendicular to B so we get power generation ( the force must be perpendicular to the B field and to the wire ) . There are two positions ( plus or minus 90 degrees ) where the tangential movement is exactly in line with the B field ( either against or opposite ) . There are two positions ( 0 or 180 degrees ) where the tangential movement is exactly perpendicular to the B field . <p> The area of the coil presented to the B field has to be more in ( a ) than in ( b ) if you consider the coil to be made of only one turn ( the simplest case ) . For a very very thin wire and approximating a field line as being very very thin but not zero , the coil in ( b ) would have only one set of field lines going through it that does not constitute an area ( a square has area , but reduce that square to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , a cube has volume , but reduce that to one side only and there is zero volume ) . So the x , y plane cuts the coil in B , but the y , z plane cuts the coil in ( a ) ( where x is left and right , y is into and out of the page , and z is up and down ) . The flux lines are passing through any surface in the y , z plane , the coil can be though of as a surface in the y , z plane in ( a ) and in the x , y plane in ( b ) . <p> I 'm not sure if i helped here or not yet <p> Last edited : Sep 22 , 2012 77974 @qwx697974 
@@71811884 @511884/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> The magnetic strength is determined by the ampere-turns ( A-T ) so , for example , 100 turns at 1A gives the same magnetic field as 200 turns at 1/2A . So you want to design with the maximum number of ampere-turns while not dissipating too much power . <p> In your example , 32 gauge at 12 V would give 12/119 *2740 =276 A-T while 30 gauge will give you 12/47*1400 = 357A-T . So the 30 gauge magnet will give you a 29% higher magnetic field at the expense of 255% more power as compared to the 32 gauge magnet . <p> One thing though , I have always read that the more loops , the stronger the electromagnet will be . If I go by your measurement and choose 28 gauge , there will be less loops but more amperes per loop . This is a bit confusing . <p> As you are finding out , the more ' loops ' ( usually called ' turns ' ) of wire you have the more ampere turns you have , and the more ampere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stronger the magnetic field the stronger the magnet is and can pick up heavier objects . But what else you are finding out is that with a certain voltage ( like 12v ) the resistance of the wire limits the current , and the current is part of the ampere turns which is what gives the magnet its strength . <p> What you may not have discovered yet however is that all batteries and power supplies have a particular internal resistance . That means that when you connect your magnet to a battery it 's not only the resistance of the wire that limits the current , it is also the internal resistance of the battery which limits current . It may not seem like much , but it plays an important role in the selection of the wire . <p> The selection of the wire is an optimization problem , and if you search around this site you 'll find a thread that talks about how to go about doing this optimization because we had an extensive talk about it a while back . Luckily , the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the optimization process results in a wire size who 's resistance ( when wound on the coil form ) is exactly equal to the internal resistance of the battery . <p> There 's a catch here however , and that is that the internal resistance of the battery might be very low and you might not want to have to use that heavy wire , or the battery might be small compared to its internal resistance . In this case you 'd be using wire that has total resistance higher than the internal battery resistance so the magnet would always be run sub optimally . <p> A simplified formula for the force is : F=K*N2*I2 <p> where K depends on the form size and some other things . Note that with a limited form size you cant add more than a certain number of turns of a given diameter . <p> Rewriting that formula like this : F=K* ( N*I ) 2 <p> reveals that if we increase N and decrease I by the same proportion , the force F will stay the same . For example , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 amps and set K=1 so we can try to optimize , we get : F=1* ( 100*2 ) 2=40000 scaled units of force . Now if we halve the diameter we can use 4 times as many turns because that much more will fit on the form now , but the resistance will increase by 4 times as well because the area goes down by a factor of 25 percent , so we end up with 1/4 of the current too which brings us to : F=1* ( 400*2/4 ) 2=40000 <p> which is the same as before . <p> The catch here is that we consider the battery internal resistance to be much less than the coil resistance , but as the total coil resistance comes down we get more and more current so the force would increase , but only up to the point where the coil resistance equals the battery internal resistance . So the bottom line then is to use as low a resistance as possible without going lower than the battery internal resistance , but in cases where the battery internal resistance is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont matter too much . You only have to think about the wire size and the current level , if the wire can handle the current . It 's good to go a little low here to keep dissipation low . A very rough guide would be if there is 1 square inch of surface area for every watt the temperature rise will be 60 degrees C , but more square inches per watt results in a lower temperature rise . <p> Last edited : May 6 , 2012 77974 @qwx697974

@@71811891 @511891/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Value of the capacitor parallel with the DC motor . <p> Hi , Can anyone tell me what 's the value of the capacitor which is connected parallel with the DC motor ? Is it called bypass capacitor ? i know only ceremic capacitor is used , non directional . What 's the value ? Is it dependent to the usage of the motor or the voltage supplied ? Thanks <p> Yes , and capacitor that goes in parallel across the power supply terminals of anything is called a bypass capacitor . The value .... that 's really up to you . Try to pick a larger value since it will better smooth *large* motor voltage spikes . Larger capacitor values also filter out low frequency noise better . <p> The capacitor you use should be rated for at least 2x the voltage the motor is running off on . 4x is preferrable . Otherwise the voltage spikes from the motor will destroy your capacitor very quickly . <p> Here are some things you should know : -If you just need the capacitor to filter out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the capacitor is for a motor controller ( to take pressure off the battery and provide power when there are voltage dips ) , then your capacitor will have to be much larger . For example , the 24V 20A motor controller I have in front of me here uses a 2200uF capacitor . I personally would have used a 4700uF capacitor . I am building a 24V 100+ amp motor controller and plan to use a HUGE capacitor ( probably overkill ) between 1F and 250mF . <p> why 2x and 4x ? the value of the capacitor should be 2 times more than the voltage the motor ! ? ! ? how come ? they are different unit ? i thought the bypass is to protect the motor ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> The capacitor is to reduce the amount of interference radiated from the motor , it has no effect on the working at all , and it certainly does n't protect the motor at all . <p> As you will find it difficult to find capacitors of such low voltages ( for most small DC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned - as it 's there to try and absorb the spikes , being higher than the motor would be obviously a good idea . <p> because of Back EMF . A coil , when de-energized , will have a collapsing magnetic field that will induce a voltage ( Back EMF ) . This voltage can be significantly higher than the original voltage feeding the coil . 2X will probably be ok but 4X is good engineering practice . <p> The capacitance of the motor and the maximum voltage it can work at are two different things . You can get a 1 Farad capacitor that can handle a maximum of 2.5V. if you try to run 12V through that capacitor you will destroy it . <p> The capacitor is not to protect the motor . Its too smooth out voltage spikes from the motor since the battery ca n't react as quickly as a capacitor can . It is also used to filter out noise . <p> Do n't go overboard , large capacitors are n't very good at rejecting very high frequencies at which they become inductive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel then 100nf is probably too big , I recommend 1nF or 470pF , or better still use ferrite beads on the connections . <p> Last edited : May 9 , 2006 77972 @qwx697972 77975 @qwx697975 <p> Ah , that explains a few things . The big capacitors are used near the motor controller to smooth voltage spikes and assist the battery , and little capacitors are used close to the motor to kill the high frequency noise ... well , there is also the practicality of not being able to stick giant caps on motor leads <p> there is also the practicality of not being able to stick giant caps on motor leads 77968 @qwx697968 <p> yea , i have seen , usually the bypass capacitor for the DC motor is not big . <p> The capacitance of the motor and the maximum voltage it can work at are two different things .

Having read the other posts in this thread I 'm assuming its to help protect from spikes and help with the HF noise . <p> So my question is , what do I ask for when I go to maplin as their not that clued up in my local one and I have no idea what I need ! <p> well the motors not easy to strip and rebuild so I only want to do it once , plus the motor was n't running great and was struggling to pressurize the system so just want to replace anything I can to try and get it running 100% . Not knowing much about motors I thought it best to replace it ? ? 
@@71811892 @511892/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Different types of D batteries ? <p> I bought an electric lantern , put 4 D batteries in it , and turned it on expecting to see a very bright light . The first thing I thought was " oh , must be dead batteries " . So I got out the trusty multimeter and check all 4 and they read 1.5v as they should . I was puzzled . I went to the store and got some more , put them in , and it worked fine . I measured the new ones and they also measured 1.5v . I measured the current through a 50 ohm resistor with both types and they both read 32mA . After closer inspection , the new batteries are Energizer D size-E95 LR20-AM1-1.5V and the old ones are Panasonic UM-1NP 1.5V . The Energizers say alkaline and the Pansonics say " Super Heavy Duty " . <p> I 'm assuming for some reason the Panasonics ca n't provide enough current for what the light is looking for . <p> 1 ) What is the difference between these batteries ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alkaline which makes the life shorter , but how does that affect current output ? ) <p> 2 ) How can I test for the max current these two types can produce ? I used a 50ohm resistor so I do n't think I could really use a much smaller one . <p> I realize now it means they are rubbish , but does n't it just mean they do n't last as long ?

Dave 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I noticed that some " D " cells , when they suffer some mechanical abuse , develop a high internal resistance and are incapable of turning a light on - but mantain a 1.5V open circuit voltage . <p> For example , dropping the lantern , if it hits the floor with its end , may cause this . <p> It happened with alkaline ( Energizer / Duracell ) D size cells , but I think it can happen with the " heavy dutty " cells as both types have a carbon rod central electrode . Y suspect that either the carbon rod breaks or it develops a bad contact where it joins the metal cap of the battery . 
@@71811893 @511893/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Treadmill motor / voltage , controller board issue <p> Hi , I am having some troubles with my Nordic Track EXP1000 treadmill and hope that someone here can help me determine the probable issues . The problem started when the treadmill would stop running in the middle of a workout session , about after 25 minutes of operating . Only the motor would stop running but the console would stay on . I noticed that the motor and the transformer were extremely hot and there was even a light burning smell . After about 5 minutes of cooling off , the treadmill could be again restarted . I visually checked the motor while the treadmill was running and noticed sparks coming from the inside . I also checked the voltage , which is supposed to be at 95V max , and the reading I got on the voltmeter fluctuated rapidly between 10 to 100V at maximum speed . <p> I assumed that the brushes were probably worn and were causing these sparks and maybe also the voltage fluctuation . I proceeded to replace the brushes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commutator with a lathe . <p> After installing the serviced motor , the sparks are still there and I now find that when someone is walking/running on the treadmill the CUR LIM light comes on constantly and the motor begins to speed-up and slow-down irregularly , making a noise as if it was being forced . Also , when there is load on the motor from a person on the walking belt the sparks are much greater . I checked the voltage again and it is the same , fluctuating rapidly between 10 to 100V , getting different readings in between . <p> I checked the AC voltage going into the control board and it is at 110V , constant . The issue is with the voltage feeding the motor . For example , readings are : 40 , 10 , 80 , 100 , 20 , 10 V , all these within 3 to 4 seconds . <p> I am positive that the issue is not the walking belt as this was replaced a few months ago and the treadmill had been running fine after that . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the motor controller board ? Is it normal to have these fluctuating voltage readings ? Any suggestion on what else I could test or try ? <p> I 'm not sure about the fluctuating voltage readings ( it may be completely normal , probably due to flyback from the coils in the motor - the commutator sparking lightly is also likely normal ) ; was it a digital multimeter ? Try testing with an analog meter as well . You might also want to check the voltage with the motor out of the loop , to make sure that is constant ( hmm - you may need to provide a load , depending on the controller - if the controller wo n't run without a load , a bank of lightbulbs could serve as a resistive load ) . When they serviced your motor , did they check the bearings ( worn , alignment , etc ) ? What about the bearings for the belt rollers ? <p> With fair certainty , the voltage reading fluctuations are the PWM waveform used as speed control . I 'd put an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what 's up . <p> This sure sounds like thermal shutdown . Is there a fan on the heatsink assembly ? Does it spin freely ? Can you unplug it and feed it from a separate power supply ? I 've seen thermally controlled fans on treadmills . Good Hunting ... &lt;&lt;&lt; ) ) ) <p> Thank you for your replies . Yes it was a digital multimeter and unfortunately I do n't have an analog one or an oscilloscope . I tried measuring the voltage with the motor out of the loop and I got similar fluctuating readings . The bearings all seem to be fine . <p> The shutdown is in fact thermal . There is a thermal switch inside the motor that is connected to the control board . The motor itself has a fan but it never overheated in the past . <p> Question - if the motor was ran at the service shop at 110V AC , when in fact it is a 95V DC motor , could they have damaged it ? I am not sure if this is what actually happened but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have occurred . <p> That it runs at all does n't make me suspect motor damage firstly . But it depends on how it runs . Not that it Could n't be the issue , but the motor shop should know how to check the windings and test it . <p> That it 's thermal : is the motor thermal switch causing the shutdown ? If so , how does it run with low/no load ? How does the motor sound ? Any kind of stuttering or stacato pulsing indicates winding troubles , most noticeable at low RPM and at load . <p> Another consideration : is there a rotation/speed sensor on the motor ? They 're usually an optocoupler with a disc or tab on the shaft . Make sure its ' clean , at very low RPM you can see the pulse on a meter . Erratic sensor behavior could explain all of this . G.H ... &lt;&lt;&lt; ) ) ) <p> Thank you again for your reply . I asked about the possible damage to the motor by running it at 110V AC instead of the 95V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a way to get the 95V DC , from a comment they made . They actually told me that it would not hurt to test the motor at the 110V AC , but I am not sure if this is right or not . So , could they have damaged it if they did run it at the wrong voltage and current type ? <p> I am almost positive that it is the thermal switch causing the shutdown as I am able to start it again after it cools of for a few minutes . With no load , the motor sounds fine , it is when it gets the load of the weight of someone on the treadmill walking belt that it starts to act and sound irregular . Can you please explain " winding troubles " ? <p> There is a rotation/speed sensor on the motor . It 's similar to those for bicycles , like a magnet that senses every rotation . This seems to be clean . Still , I am not sure if the electronics behind this sensor could be working properly or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue is that the motor sparks while running , and the sparks become quite heavy when the motor has a load . Also , the speed fluctuates constantly with the load and after a few minutes , it overheats and the thermal switch shuts it down . <p> I assumed that the brushes were probably worn and were causing these sparks and maybe also the voltage fluctuation . I proceeded to replace the brushes and took the motor to a service shop where they resurfaced the commutator with a lathe . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Hmm - extra sparking could be caused by a resurface commutator and new brushes ( they were brand new , right ? ) , as the brushes would take some time to wear in . Afterward , light sparking would be considered normal on a brushed motor , slightly heavier sparking with load . <p> After installing the serviced motor , the sparks are still there and I now find that when someone is walking/running on the treadmill the CUR LIM light comes on constantly and the motor begins to speed-up and slow-down irregularly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Can you describe the noise ? I am still wondering about the bearings ; when the motor is running without being connected to the belt , how does it sound ? Do you hear any clicking or grinding noises ? " Winding troubles " could be many things , but one could be a loose or shifting winding on the rotor , which could cause issues . Do you have any way to remove the motor , mount it on a bench or stand of some sort , and apply a makeshift " pony brake " to the shaft to simulate a load ? <p> Can you remove the motor and grab the shaft ( or pulley/flywheel , as the case may be ) and try to shift it from side to side ( mounted on a bench or other sturdy and fixed surface is best ) laterally , and fore/aft axially , checking for play in the bearings . What about when you spin it by hand ( or run it from a high-current 12 VDC source , like a car battery , IF it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than normal ) - do you hear any abnormal noises . <p> There is n't a lot a play between the motor 's rotor and its magnets ( is it a permanent magnet motor , or universal ? I own a treadmill motor I picked up at a Goodwill store - it has permanent magnets - but I suppose a universal motor could be used - heck , even an AC motor is possible ) in the case ; if it has a bad bearing ( or a loose winding ) that throws it off balance under load , the rotor can collide with the magnets or field coils . <p> When you took it to the motor repair shop , did you describe the symptoms , or did you just tell them the commutator was sparking ? I 'm just really surprised if they did n't check the bearings , give it a load test , check the windings , and check the rotor/field for scrapes , etc that might indicate an issue ... <p> Thanks again for your response . The brushes were new but I ran the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have settled by now , right ? I took them out and they now have the commutator 's curved shape . <p> This CUR LIM light is supposed to mean that the motor is drawing the amp limit from the control board . The noise is like if the motor was struggling to operate , electrical noise maybe ? It is not a grinding noise or any type of friction noise nor a clicking noise . I can simulate the load , as you are asking , by just removing the belt that drives the treadmill 's walking belt and operating the motor at the same spot where it is mounted . What would I be looking for with this test ? <p> As for the bearings , if I just spin the shaft with the motor unmounted it spins freely . I would think that these are fine .

How would they test the winding ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Well - visual inspection , followed by a continuity check between the communtator 's contacts . Something else I am wondering is if - maybe ( long shot here ) the brushes are n't the right size for the motor ; if , for instance , the brushes installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brushes might be contacting more windings than necessary , increasing the current draw of the device ( and perhaps causing the " struggle " noise you are hearing as the extra coils on the rotor are energized at the wrong part of the rotation cycle ... ? <p> I 'm not sure what you can do regarding the repair shop you are using ; you sound like your kinda stuck with what you have . If you had a spare set of brushes , and knew how to change them ( and how to disassemble/reassemble the motor - its not normally difficult , but each motor is different - I 've got this motor that is really difficult to put back together because the bolts that hold the bearing plates to the stator casing are made of steel , and they pass right between the poles of a large pair of permanent magnets ; keeping the bolt from sticking to one magnet or the other while passing the bolt thru to the other end can be an exercise in frustration and patience , let me tell you ) - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motor in , then you could remove the rotor , and match the new brushes up to the commutator , to see how many pole contacts each cover ( they should be the same ) . Then , you could use an emery board to file bevels on the corners of each brush to remove contact with two of the contacts , taking out two poles , then reassemble the motor , and see if it runs better ( because fewer poles would be involved , taking less current , and maybe fixing the struggle issue ) . <p> That 's all a real long shot , though - based on a guess that the motor wore out its brushes down to the nub previously , and the wrong sized set was put in afterward ... <p> I 'd also look for any cross conducting in the commutator . After lathe trueing , you Must clean up the spaces between commutator contacts . A piece of a jewelers ' saw blade works well . Smoothing/polishing after that is always good : 600 grit paper then 1000 . <p> Set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . You can see the sensor respond at ( very ) low speed on a meter . It depends on test equ available . Good Hunting , this one is n't obvious . <p> I would almost bet on one or more open windings on the rotor . Testing is pretty simple -- with the motor out of circuit and the brushes removed , simply use an ohmmeter to check for continuity from any one commutator segment to the segment 180- around the commutator . Each measurement should show approximately the same resistance as any other ; an infinite reading indicates an open winding . Make sure that there is no continuity between any given segment and the segments directly adjacent thereto . <p> While testing for continuity , be sure to examine the commutator for proper undercutting of the mica segment separators as was already mentioned . Proper undercut will have a depth that is equal to its width , i. e. , the space between commutator segments . Ideally , the trailing edge of each segment should overhang the undercut slightly , which will help to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon how much material was removed from the commutator surface , your brush spring tension will be affected ... <p> Some info that might help . Did you take the treadmill through calibration ? Did it pass ? The manufacturer knows how to tell instruct you the through calibration process ? Test your resistance for the motor with it unplugged . The motor should have connections to do this . The manufacturer will have the specs for that motor and its resistance . <p> Speculation : you need a new motor , your speed sensor needs to be replaced , or your motor control board is not communicating with the motor and its a matter of replacing some cables . There also appears to be a power issue . Its unlikely you have a dedicated power source going to your treadmill . Treadmills generally do n't like to share power . They are power hogs . This could be causing the fluctuations in the voltage to the motor . It appears that you are towards needing a new motor . <p> Something else I am wondering is if - maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right size for the motor ; if , for instance , the brushes installed are wider than what is required for that motor , the brushes might be contacting more windings than necessary , increasing the current draw of the device ( and perhaps causing the " struggle " noise you are hearing as the extra coils on the rotor are energized at the wrong part of the rotation cycle ... ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Thanks , actually , the brushes are the right size as they have to fit into a special sized compartment in order to install them . The brushes I took out were not completely worn out but I just decided to change them assuming that maybe they were no longer making good contact and that was causing the sparks . <p> I 'd also look for any cross conducting in the commutator .

This treadmill has been on the same power outlet for years now and it used to work fine up until a few weeks ago . Therefore , I rule out the power issue . That would leave the motor and the motor control board , which is what I am trying to determine which one of the two is the issue , or maybe even both . I would hate to replace one of these to later find out that it was actually the other component that needed replacing ! At what point would the motor be considered unrepairable ? Thanks . <p> In a typical motor of the type that you have , each winding or " loop " of wire on the rotor is terminated at each end by its connection to a copper bar , which is formed to comprise a " segment " of the commutator . Normally , the opposite ends of any specific winding are physically located 180- apart on the commutator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side by a thin strip of insulating material , usually a piece of mica . <p> The mica is harder than the copper , so as the commutator wears , the mica ( if not undercut ) will end up being higher than the copper . This will cause the brushes to lift off the copper surface each time they pass over the mica . Of course , this creates a gap between the brush and the copper , resulting in heavy arcing which in turn causes pitting of the copper surface . The result of that is accelerated brush wear . Also , in an extreme case , mica that is significantly higher than the copper can cause breakage of the brushes . <p> If the mica is undercut too deeply , copper and brush dust will accumulate in the cut , which can eventually create a short between adjacent segments . A cut of the proper depth will generally allow the collected dust to be thrown out by centrifugal force as the rotor turns . <p> If the mica undercut is not deep enough , the copper segments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably beyond ) before the normal brush life has elapsed . Of course , this will then necessitate additional commutator service . <p> If the undercut is too narrow , a thin line of mica will be left on one or both sides of the cut . As already discussed , this has the same effect as not having undercut the mica at all , as the mica will end up higher than the copper with commutator wear . Another possibility here is breakage of the mica , with the possibility of the broken-off piece becoming lodged between the brush and the commutator . Typically , cut width is specified to be 0.003 " wider than the thickness of the mica separator . Properly centered , this will result in a small amount ( 0.0015 " ) of copper being removed from each side as the cut is made . <p> If the cut is too wide , heavy arcing will usually occur . Depending upon specific commutator and brush configurations , a wide cut can also cause brush " cocking " and breakage . <p> To address the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overhanging trailing edge -- some motor manufacturers specify a " keystone " shaped undercut , wherein the physical gap at the commutator surface is slightly narrower than the width at the bottom of the cut . This serves two purposes . Firstly , it helps to ensure that there is no mica remaining that will cause brush lift as already described . Secondly , it helps to prevent brush cocking and breakage by providing a smoother transition from one segment to the next as the rotor turns . <p> The trailing edge is the edge of the commutator that the brush is leaving as it moves onto the next segment . In a bi-directional motor , either edge of each segment will be the trailing edge , depending upon which direction the motor is turning . In this case , a " true " keystone cut is recommended . In the case of a unidirectional motor such as a automotive starter motor , a cutter is used that makes a " modified " keystone cut , with only the trailing edge being angled , and the leading edge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to make with a saw blade as has been suggested . Several tool makers produce special tools for the cutting of the mica in this manner . If using a saw blade , do n't worry about the overhang that a keystone cut would provide -- just be sure to remove all mica on both sides of the cut to the full depth of the cut that you are making . As I mentioned in my previous post , typical cut depth is equivalent to the mica width . Also , it is better to use the saw blade " backwards " , i.e. , with the teeth pointing towards you so that the blade cuts as you pull it towards you . Do not put force on the blade -- the weight of the blade is usually sufficient to cut the mica . While a jeweler 's saw will work , satisfactory results for most larger motors can be obtained with a standard fine-tooth ( 24 to 32 teeth per inch ) hacksaw blade . snap the rounded end off the blade to allow it to cut properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that this helps to clarify the subject ; post back if you need further explanation ... <p> use an ohmmeter to check for continuity from any one commutator segment to the segment 180- around the commutator .

Proper undercut will have a depth that is equal to its width , ... 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I checked for continuities and I do get just about the same resistance readings between each set of commutator segments separated at 180- , with no infinite readings at all . However , I do get continuity between each and all adjacent segments . This is no good , right ? Does this mean that the segments are shorted ? Is there an easy way to fix this ? <p> I checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do n't seem to find any ... it looks like there are only gaps between the segments but I do n't see any material filling the gaps ( see pictures ) . Is this normal or are the mica separators missing ? Also , I notice that the depth of these gaps seem to be deeper than the width ( again , see pictures ) , I am assuming that this should be normal for this motor as this is how it has always been .

@@71811894 @511894/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> How do you determine primary winding OHMS on an unknown Audio Transformer ? <p> There are lots of audio transformers for sale on ebay but many of the sellers have no idea what they are selling .

This is great information . I learn something new every day . <p> 40 years ago when I was working in electronics every day I had a good supply of about 200 used transformers on hand . I would put 6 volts across the 16 ohm secondary winding of a 5000 ohm transformer then read the voltage across the primary winding and if the voltage was 106 volts . Then I would get all the unknown used transformers of the same physical size and test them 1 by 1 doing the same thing if I got 106 volts on the primary then I assumed it was 5000 ohms too . This was an idea I figured out on my own it always seemed to be correct the used transformers worked just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 200 transformers on hand anymore I wish I did . <p> Also , what Jon mentioned about the impedance of a transformer is interesting , but with audio transformers they are often designed with a given load in mind . This means there is some optimization that goes into the design of many transformers regarding a given load impedance ( and consequently a given source impedance ) . The difference between the theory and practice here is that the audio transformer does best when used as the manufacturer recommends , so if they say " 16 ohms " then they mean 16 ohms and not 4 ohms . The difference comes in the form of added distortion and some loss of low frequency response . Whether or not this is going to matter for your exact application is a question only you can answer by test . For the lack of information though i would go with the recommended load impedance such as that stamped on the transformer body . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Transformers just transform AC . They have absolutely no clue whether they 're transforming audio signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do n't even know what impedance is . All they see is current and voltage , and impedance is something that is calculated from this . <p> If you have 40Vrms at the secondary and your load is drawing 2.5A from the secondary at this voltage ( basically a 16 ohm load ) with an impedance ratio of 106.25 , the primary will see a plate-plate voltage of 412Vrms @ 121mA , which would be the equivalent of a 1.7K ohm plate-plate load , which would also yield a 425R load from each plate to the center tap . <p> They also have OT 's with multi-tap secondaries that allow you to run 4 , 8 or 16 ohm loads while yielding the same reflected primary impedance . <p> If you double the load impedance on the secondary , the reflected primary impedance ALSO doubles . If you halve the load impedance on the secondary , the reflected primary impedance also halves . <p> It really is that simple . Audio transformers are just power transformers that operate at audio frequencies . If you look at a Class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's nothing more than a full wave grounded center tap rectifier circuit flipped upside down and backwards . <p> the DC resistance of the windings would have something to do with those results , as well as the coupling factor between the windings. these two factors ( as well as others , such as parasitic capacitances ) introduce losses which would show up as less than ideal results compared to the theory . did you notice that at 8 ohms , the results of the impedance ratio calculation closely matched the measured voltage ratio ? the reflected primary impedance with a secondary load of 8 ohms was also very close to 5k . <p> The measured results are n't following the simple rule you gave , so apparently there 's more to it than the simple rule . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> The Transformer Design book I am reading says impedance changes by the cube of the core area of the transformer . I may need to go back and read that again to be sure that is correct . But anyway it seem the larger the transformer the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs fewer turns on the primary to have the same impedance of a smaller transformer . <p> The output transformer of a vacuum tube amplifier causes a lot of problems because an 8 ohm speaker is 8 ohms only at a few frequencies . The speaker and enclosure resonate at a low frequency with a high impedance that needs damping to avoid booming . The high output impedance of a vacuum tube amplifier provides poor damping but the extremely low output impedance of a solid-state amplifier provides excellent damping . Each speaker has inductance then its impedance rises at high frequencies . The crossover network also changes the impedance of a speaker system . <p> The output level from the output transformer of a vacuum tube amplifier changes when the speaker impedance changes . But the output level from a solid state amplifier does not . <p> Seriously , I think it would be in your best interests to retract this statement . I know you know better than this . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> He 's got a serious hang up about valve amplifiers , but there 's an iota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the degree he claims .

Then changes in load impedance by changes in a speaker 's impedance vs frequency will make less difference in output level . <p> A solid state amplifier has a lot of negative feedback that reduces its output impedance ( and distortion ) to almost zero so its output level does not change when a speaker 's impedance changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift is used in a vacuum tube amplifier then it can have some negative feedback to reduce its fairly high output impedance ( and also reduce its fairly high distortion ) .

With output transformers you do have to worry about the efficiency of the OT yes , so power out = efficiency % of power in . HOWEVER , speaker impedance changes on BOTH types of amplifiers yet output voltage holds constant . This means that output CURRENT will change with speaker impedance .

We only want to hear valve amp FACTS here ... not your personal hang ups with them <p> Nigel Goodwin said : <p> Do n't forget , as the impedance of the speaker changes with frequency , the impedance of the transformer changes as well . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Yes this is correct but the RATIO at which it changes is the same as it is on the secondary side . If you have a 50% change in load impedance on the secondary side , there will be a corresponding 50% change in reflected primary impedance as well . 
@@71811895 @511895/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Higher Voltage : Fool Your Alternator ? <p> It has been said that charging a car battery at a voltage that is higher than usual for a short time period will help the battery store charge better . This means a longer useful life as well as a longer allowable idle period before it needs to be recharged . I think the auto industry has recognized this fact over the years as newer alternators are said to put out a higher voltage than older ones . Some of the older ones may have only put out 13.8v but that 's not enough . <p> Using a charger circuit to do this is no problem , simply raise the voltage level . But what if you want to use the alternator to do this instead ? This would mean you would not have to remove the battery or have the car close to a 120vac or 230vac line to power the charger . <p> So have you tried this , and if so how did you modify your alternator or associated circuit in the automobile ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14.5 up to a max of about 16v , but i 'd be more apt to limit it to 15v. 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Are you sure you get ' longer useful life ' ? This article suggests battery life would be shortened . 77973 @qwx697973 <p> First , let us make sure we understand how an automotive alternator works . Here is a block diagram of the typical automotive alternator charging system : <p> This shows an alternator with a built-in Voltage Regulator ( VR ) . Basically , the voltage regulator senses the battery voltage on the S wire , and controls the current in the rotating field winding ( Rotor ) via F1 and F2 . The IG wire simply switches on/switches off the VR circuit so that it does n't drain the battery when the vehicle is parked . The current produced by the alternator goes to the battery via the B wire . <p> When the alternator is spinning , the rotating magnetic field created by DC current flowing in the Rotor through the slip rings induces three-phase AC currents in the Stator windings ( stationary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the six-diode bridge inside the alternator . The important take away is that a small DC current in the rotor winding ( F1 F2 ) makes a much larger DC current ( with a bit of ripple on it ) at B. Another important point is that the VR senses battery voltage and controls the average field ( rotor ) current . <p> The wiring is similar if the VR is in a separate box , mounted external to the alternator . In this case , F1 is sometimes connected to the B wire inside the alternator , and the VR controls F2 by sinking current , or F2 is grounded inside the alternator , and the VR controls F1 by sourcing current . <p> To demonstrate the key elements of how a charging system works , I made this simple LTSpice simulation . It has much simplified behavioral models of the VR , alternator , battery , and some static loads , but it behaves similarly to the real thing .. <p> The alternator is modeled as a current-controlled current source with Iout = 30*Irotor . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60A Prestolite Alternator in my Cessna 182 . It assumes that the Alternator is spun up at an rpm where it can produce full output ( not at idle ) . The typical resistance of the Rotor of a 14V automotive alternator is about 8 Ohms . The inductance of the Rotor is quite large , measured at 1H . <p> If you bypass the regulator , and apply full battery voltage directly to the Rotor ( between F1 and Ground ) , the Rotor current is 2A , and if you spin up the alternator to 5000rpm , the alternator puts out it 's full rated near 60A . It acts very much like a current source . If you open-circuit the alternator output , the voltage will soar to over 150V ( its compliance ) . In normal operation , it is the battery that holds down the alternator output voltage ( and filters the ripple ) . Think of " Load-Dump " . <p> The VR is modeled as a voltage-controlled switch S1 ( which is what it is ) with a bit of hysteresis . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 4mV of hysteresis . To make the switch turn off when the battery voltage is above 14.24V , I set Ron=10meg . When the battery voltage is below 14.20V , I close the switch by making R0ff=10mOhm . Note that this is a classic bang-bang house thermostat type of control system . The VR either applies full battery voltage to the Rotor , or zero volts to the Rotor . The average Rotor current is the result of the VR acting as a Pulse Width Modulator ( PWM ) . You need to understand this if you are mucking about with the VR . <p> The battery is modeled as a huge capacitorC1 , with some internal resistance . The static load ( represents the things in the car that draw current ) is shown as R2 . <p> Now look at the first plot pane , which shows what typically happens right after motor start . Cranking the starter pulls some charge out of the battery , making its initial voltage 12V or lower . This is sensed by the VR , and it applies the battery voltage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast idle or faster , the alternator cranks out nearly its full rated output of 57A , about 14A of which goes into R2 , and the rest is available to charge the battery . The time scale on this sim is arbitrary for illustration only , but see V(bus) green trace does during the first 20 sec . The " battery " is being charged at a rate of 57-14 = 43A . <p> At 20 sec , the battery V(Bus) green trace voltage exceeds the setpoint of 14.24V , and the VR begins doing its thing . Note the alternator output current I(B1) red trace decreasesasymptotically approaching the 14A static load current . The battery voltage is maintained within a few tens of mV . The VR is now regulating the battery voltage . If more loads are turned on , the VR increases the average Rotor current to cause the battery ( bus ) voltage to stay constant . <p> Now look at the second plot pane . I plot the detail of the voltage at F1 ( output of the VR ) as V(f1) green trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also show the current through the Rotor as I(L1) red trace . Note the low-pass filtering effect of the inductance of the Rotor , and the catch diode D1 . Does this remind you of what happens in a Switch Mode Power Supply ? Note that the VR makes PWM that is not constant frequency ; it is whatever it has to be to make the average Rotor current be what it has to be to create enough current at the B output to just keep the battery voltage near the VR 's set point . Remember that I(B1) is 30 times I(L1) . <p> I have used a ' scope to look at the PWM at the field terminal in my airplane and various cars . Once the battery recovers after the initial charge up , the PWM rate varies between 30Hz and 150Hz . This is the ripple attributable to the PWM ; nothing to do with the 3-phase , full-wave rectified ripple which I am ignoring in this simple simulation . <p> In the next posting , I will show the details of some real VRs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx697970 <p> I thought I had . Here 's what it says : - " The correct setting of the charge voltage is critical and ranges from 2.30 to 2.45V per cell . Setting the voltage threshold is a compromise , and battery experts refer to this as ' dancing on the head of a needle . On one hand , the battery wants to be fully charged to get maximum capacity and avoid sulfation on the negative plate ; on the other hand , an over-saturated condition causes grid corrosion on the positive plate and induces gassing .

Once the current drops to a certain level , we turn off the charger and start using the battery again . This is more or less how the automobile charges the battery too , after we start the car . <p> But what i am talking about is a secondary charge method , that works in addition to the ' normal ' charging profile . This is where , every so often , we apply a much higher voltage than usual for a limited time period . This is not done for every charge cycle , just once in a while , depending on the battery condition i would think . <p> We have to be careful how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this kind of charging the same way we normally charge , just once in a while , and i can go into detail a little more with this in a minute . <p> I did not want to word my first post as if this was something that was tried and proven , but if you look at Mike 's links , you 'll see some very informative and true information . Also , i have seen this in action myself recently but never saw it worded out quite so well like that . <p> Ok , so what exactly does it take and how can this improve the battery life ... <p> First , the battery is charged normally , but because the car may not charge it all the way up for various reasons , the battery starts to suffer voltage depression . This is where the voltage starts out at a reasonable level , but drops down faster than it should . This i believe is because the battery over time develops a higher series resistance , and that prevents complete charging . Each time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If left alone for 2 days at a time after each use , we would see the battery voltage drop more and more until it was almost dead . If we are lucky , the resistance still allows at least some charge so we can start the next time we go to use it . After this happens though , if we apply a higher voltage ( something like 14.5 to 16v but adjusted as needed ) the series resistance drops down to a lower value , and it can be quite significant . Now when we use the car once every three days , it charges up much better each time , until after a couple months or so it happens again and we have to do a higher charge again . So it looks like once every two months or so . <p> If the alternator voltage could be turned up a little , it may be possible to eliminate this effect , but that would probably require measure the temperature of the battery internally ( not ambient temperature ) to get it right each time . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we go with the secondary charge . <p> How can i be so sure this works ? I have several months of data now that shows that this is what happens . I only had two test batteries , but the same thing happens with both . I had discarded one a couple years back but kept it around for a while and found that if i charged it with a home charger it would work again , to my surprise . The new one started getting flaky too , but once i charged it with the secondary method it started to work better as well , showing the same basic thing : the internal resistance goes down with the secondary charge and therefore it allows the normal charge to put more charge into the battery during each charge , even though it 's not perfect . This second battery was much worse however so i had to bring it back for a replacement anyway , but the technique did show this idea to work with that one too even though it was seriously defective . Alternately like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time then we would probably not have to do this , and if we err on the high side ( too long of a charge each time ) then we ruin the battery in another physical way so we ca n't ' restore ' it , so we err on the low side and then it requires a secondary charging technique . I do measurements every day , about one to three times per day . I get the measurements from a sending unit installed in the car that sends the data to the house where i log it ( voltage , temperature , time ) . If i look at the profile , i see the voltage dropping slowly over time ( a couple months ) and it is clear that after each use it is not being charged completely , at least not how much the battery is capable of taking . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> That 's a very good post there and shows a lot of information . Very nice of you to share that with us . Some of those links confirms what i have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily measurements on my automobile battery . Nice to finally see it worded out so well . <p> Now the question still on my mind is , how did you actually fool the alternator into putting out a higher voltage ? I do n't  want to guess because this is something i want to do myself and i want it to work the first time without too many problems . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Indeed I did . Looks like it 's a fine balance between lengthening and shortening the battery life . <p> fool the alternator into putting out a higher voltage ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> My concern there would be that any downstream voltage regulators in the vehicle 's electronic systems would have to drop more volts and so cope with dissipating more power .

So you are saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulator inside . That makes sense . I thought you could just add an external resistor though , in series with the voltage regulator , but i do n't  know your voltage regulator very well . <p> I have a couple problems that you probably do n't  have with yours . First , i do n't  think my alternator has a ' sense ' input . I have a feeling ( but not sure ) that it is just and ' on/off ' function , so that when the ignition turns on it tells the VR to go ahead and start pumping current to the winding . That terminal however i do n't  think has any ability to regulate the current , just allow it to flow , period . Second , the other input is a ' bulb ' output that runs the failure indicator bulb ( standard small incandescent ) . I doubt that senses voltage too although i have no idea for sure . Third , my alternator has a third set of three diodes : first and second sets ( 6 diodes total ) are high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 more ) is low current ( 1 amp maybe ) that might provide the feedback to the VR . So i suspect those three diodes supply the feedback signal and that 's what varies the total output of the alternator , but i ca n't be sure they might even supply the current to the winding ( via slip rings ) . <p> Have any idea how this might be altered , and is there any change that can be done externally to the alternator ? Mine comes apart , but it 's very cramped inside . Also , my VR is totally potted and a new one is $60 or more USD . That means i probably can not get to the VR circuit itself . <p> Also , i find that the ground connection to the body of the alternator might be critical . Any idea how critical this really is ? I suspect that any drop in the ground circuit can lower the max charge voltage , as the regulator then sees a higher than real battery voltage and thinks it 's charged already .

It 's interesting that they would add three tiny diodes just for that when they basically perform the same function as the other set of three big diodes . Three of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly the same as the three tiny diodes , just that the tiny diode cathodes all go to the regulator and i think one brush , the ' positive ' brush , and the three big diode cathodes go to the battery positive terminal . <p> I have seen another mod that requires adding an extra series diode between the three tiny diode cathodes and wherever the cathodes went . That is what gave me the idea that the VR might be sensing from the cathodes of the three tiny diodes , possibly in addition to driving the winding . But i have no idea if this works or not , and it would be hard to mount a diode into that packed alternator , so i was hoping for another solution . <p> So i guess the only thing i can do then is test it with some external resistance ? That 's a little hard to do too but i think i can swing it if i make up an adapter like plug connector for the terminal that needs the connection . <p> What do you think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77974 @qwx697974 <p> I have seen an alternator that is as you describe , where the extra diode-trio is used as a source of the Rotor current ( wired directly to F1 ) , AND is used as the sense input to the electronic Voltage Regulator . The big B terminal comes from the common-cathode of the three-phase rectifier is wired to the battery . This means that the VR is sensing not the actual battery voltage , but a faux voltage which is supposed to represent the battery voltage , but is n't . You would have to break into the connection between the diode trio cathodes and where it goes into the VR to add resistance or a diode-drop to raise the battery voltage ... <p> This system is what I call the Motorola system , which was only used for a few years when US cars first came out with alternators in the 1960s . This was copied by the Russians , and a lot of cold-war era Yugos , et al are running around with this system . What are you driving ? <p> BTW , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dash ever burns out . To light that lamp , current flows from the battery , through the lamp backwards into the alternator .

Tracking down a problem from testing , I could really use a few pointers . <p> ok , which channel ? i 'm guessing it 's a front channel since you said it 's in both A and B speaker outputs . check R526 and R576. they are the ceramic resistors with 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center wire to each end . if you have one open , you probably have a bad output transistor as well . these output devices are darlingtons and should be replaced as a pair , which is how sony sells them . try to get them from sony if possible . second sourcing them is a very IFFY proposition , since half the time you will get counterfeits , the other half of the time they will have differing beta range codes . <p> also , this might help something else from getting broken in the future . i see this all the time and it just takes a few minutes of preventative action to keep a serious problem from occurring . <p> on some of sony 's receivers , the section of the main board where the display board ribbon cable connects can get broken . if that section of the main board is an L-shaped section of board , then the following can keep it from breaking and creating a world of headaches repairing it . remove the screw that holds the L-shaped section to the receiver frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to down and away from the board . this will keep that section of the board ( where a lot of control signals pass through ) from breaking if the unit is dropped or moderately bumped . this is a recurring problem with sony receivers , since they 've kept the same chassis stamping and basic board layout for the past 10 years or more . there are about 20 traces in that small area that are tuner and display control lines , and the cmos buffer chip for some of these signals is right there too . if that 's not an L-shaped area of the board , do n't worry about it . <p> I do have something called a labjack , which supposedly can act as a basic computer based oscilloscope but I have never used it as one .

I 'll post more info once I 've tested it . <p> you could have broken solder connections on one of those resistors ........ <p> be VERY careful using a soundcard oscope .... the max input to a soundcard is +/-5V , and the rail voltages and output voltages from your receiver are in excess of +/-30V. there is no isolation in a soundcard 's input , so that 30V or more could easily find it 's way onto your PC 's motherboard .... leaving behind a smoking ruin . <p> just make sure you do n't exceed the input voltage ratings .... a real scope is usually somewhat forgiving of overloaded inputs . but smaller devices are n't . <p> you may want to inspect the bottom of the pc board carefully to see if there are any cracks in it . my usual way of looking for cracked pc boards is to backlight it and look for light or dark lines that go through the substrate . some cracks will be too small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing through the material . when possible i use a light table which is the best way to do it , but having a lamp behind the board works almost as good <p> I 've checked the L shaped boards , which look like the input connection boards .

They all measured 1.1 ohms when unpowered on my voltmeter , none measured open . I 'll check when powered and see if there 's any difference , but it seems unlike that there is a problem with these resistors . <p> I 've also measured the dc voltage across the front channels and there is nothing . <p> I can confirm the problem is still present and it is the right channel that is causing the problem . It does work , but it distorts even at relatively low volume . As near as I can tell , it 's across the spectrum , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly when listening to voice , but that 's probably because it 's easier to distinguish the problem . <p> Do anything else you can suggest I check ? I 've got the oscilloscope working , what should I be checking next ? <p> A little more interesting when measuring the resistors when powered . I turned on all 5 channels on the amp and each dropped to .4 omhs except for R576 . Do n't know what it means , but at least it 's different . From my reading of the diagram , this is for the right channel which is the problem one . <p> Does this mean that R576 is faulty , or that something leading to it is faulty ? <p> just curious , what is R576 ? if it 's a ceramic resistor , and it gave you a different reading than the others like it ( even though you should n't measure resistance with power applied ) , then something is different here . i would measure the voltages across those resistors with it powered up . R576 is the emitter resistor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's R576 and the output transistors , and their associated components you should be checking . one of the output transistors could be bad , or one of the 180 ohm resistors feeding the bases of the outputs . Q554 and Q555 are n't likely to cause distortion , but if there is a problem with the output devices , it 's likely one or both of these transistors is bad too . with the POWER OFF . use the ohmmeter in diode check mode to test the 2 power transistors. the picture shows the pinout of both devices . on the MN2488 from B-E and B-C you should read open with the negative ( black ) ohmmeter lead on B , and you should read low resistance with the red lead on B. from C-E you should read open with the red lead on C , and you MIGHT read low resistance with the black lead on C. with the MP1620 , you should read low resistance B-C and B-E with the black lead on B and open with the red lead on B. you should read open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you MIGHT read low resistance with the red lead on C. if all of these readings are ok , proceed to checking the resistors with the ohmmeter back in resistance mode . the ceramic resistor R576 should read less than an ohm end-to-end ( meter leads have some resistance that makes reading low resistances somewhat inaccurate ) . R574 and R575 should read close to 180 ohms. when testing D551 , D552 , D553 and D554 should all read open with the red meter lead on the end with the stripe ( make sure you return to diode check mode ) and low resistance with the black lead on the end with the stripe. since we 're looking first for the cause of distortion , do n't worry about Q554 and Q555 yet . <p> do these checks first , since if you do n't find anything wrong here , we 're headed back to IC501 , and static testing of IC501 is n't so simple , but we do have identical IC 's near it to make comparisons with <p> I 'm at work right now so ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is I believe a ceramic resistor .

@@71811898 @511898/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> The advantage is that there is no call and return overhead , so a speed advantage . The disadvantage is that it tends to use more code space . This is an enduring dilemma for the programmer , speed versus size . <p> A significant difference not mentioned is that macros can be parameterised , so that each macro expansion need not generate the same code sequence each time , whereas a function is coded once and that 's it . Macro parameterisation is really one of the neat features , lending macro usage not just to inlined code , but to code sequences that are , for example , essentially the same in purpose , but that require to be coded differently in different situations . Examples might be setting PCL and PCLATH appropriately prior to a table lookup , based on the value of a label value . <p> A further possible advantage of macro 's is to be frugal on stack usage .

What determines the positional accuracy of a servo , and what are typical values ? <p> I 'm not very experienced with running servos , although I think I understand their basic operational theory . <p> The new digital servos mention ' increased precision .

I looked at Hitec servo specs online and could n't see anything about positional accuracy . Currently I 'm using stepper motors to precisely turn a camera platform , but it 's difficult to add a useful feedback element , like a shaft encoder , to something that already rotates so slowly . <p> What I 'd really like is a simple replacement for the stepper - something with feedback so i know exactly where I 'm pointing . If i replaced the ( 1.8degree ) stepper with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I could get the same 1.8 degree ( i.e 200 positions per revolution ) resolution out of the servo ? <p> I can only suggest you get one and try - but can you easily get a 360 degree servo ? . <p> Assuming the existing system gives enough accuracy , how about adding feedback to the existing stepper system ? - link a pot to the movement , although this will only give you 270 degrees . Perhaps you could find a 360 degree pot ? . <p> Also , there are not really 360 degree servos because of the limits on the rotation of the potentiometer as well as the gears have stops ( and sometimes not even full round gears ) . <p> I also doubt there is much difference between the pots used in analog servos vs those used in digital servos . The measurement circuitry is probably more accurate , but in my mind what it realy reads is : <p> " Digital servos have increased precision in the measurement circuitry of the pot and/or PWM resulting in increased precision ... all other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting in varying precision " <p> Ca n't you use an absolute magnetic encoder ? Like the MAE3 at US Digital ? It does n't matter how slowly it rotates then ... then it again why does it matter at all how slowly the thing is rotating when as long as the encoder has a resolution greater than what you need ? <p> I 've actually made a somewhat less sexy 2-axis rig ( the controller uses a PIC uC , naturally ) for the same purpose ( motion timelapses ) , and although my stepper is fairly precise it 's also very slow . I thought a servo type motor ( which is what camblock uses ) with its feedback would be faster and ( potentially more ) precise . <p> but it 's difficult to add a useful feedback element , like a shaft encoder , to something that already rotates so slowly . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> not about servos , but I 've seen a cheap and accurate way of measuring rotation used in printers , it involves an emitter/sensor in a single piece and a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

And have an INDEX pulse that occurs once every revolution . <p> You can also get a QUADRATURE shaft encoder that puts out 2 or 4 bit grey code and do the counting externally . <p> Also this is precision of MEASUREMENT .

It 's based on a 1527 chipset &amp; 433MHZ . I use a key fob transmitter . The mfg. claims 150 - 200 meter range , but that 's suspect . The receiver antenna is a piece of coiled wire probable about 10 " long if uncoiled . Can I do anything with the antenna to maximize the sensitivity ? I have the realestate to add more wire or a metal plate , so I am open to all suggestions . <p> Tuning both the transmit and the receive antennas should give solid improvements . The first step is to make the transmitter antenna much better because the antenna inside a key fob is going to be quite poor . Could you tolerate mounting the transmitter on a handle or pistol grip ? This would allow you to add a more substantial tx antenna but be able to tolerate its size and weight . The tx antenna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stiff wire , or to a dipole backed by a flat metal disc as a reflector . As for the receiver , the best you can do there without getting ridiculous is to make the antenna into a more ideal quarter wave monopole . For this to work , you need a metal disk or wire groundplane that has a radius of about a quarter wavelength . At 433 Mhz , and accounting for a reduced velocity on metal , this would be about 138mm . I 've done this simply with four wires of this length , radiating away in four directions and bent down from horizontal by about 30 degrees . That ground plane should work well enough . The radiating element will tune well once it has this ground plane and you will find that 138mm is the right length for that too ( plus or minus about 10% if you want to tune it ) <p> Thanks for your reply . I may try the receiver antenna you describe , but the TX needs to stay as is . Can you point me to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having trouble visualizing the wires at 30deg &amp; the metal plate combo . BTW This is going into a tennis ball machine ( plastic case ) &amp; I am switching a couple of functions . I have a bit of vertical space inside on the right side , but not on the side facing the TX . Use will be line of sight &lt; 100 ' . It may be fine the way it is , but since I am mounting the controller &amp; relays inside , I would like to get it tweaked while I have it opened up . <p> Antennas interact with their surroundings a lot . If you intend to integrate the antenna into the plastic case , I may not be able to suggest something practical without studying the available volume first hand . This is pretty hard to do via a forum like this . My suggestion of an ideal monopole requires that you place it on top of the tennis ball machine . This is because the interaction that I spoke of is most powerful to the sides of the vertical element . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything and especially metal , its performance will be degraded . However , if you place a monopole such as this on the very top , in the clear of any metal , the " ground plane " at its base isolates it from metal underneath , so no degradation occurs . The suggestion of a monopole , therefore , requires that you put it up on top with the vertical wire poking out from the top of the machine . <p> If that is acceptable , then I 'll describe it in a bit more detail . Now , I do n't know if your receiver uses a coaxial cable to attach its antenna to the circuit board . Possibly not and in this case we have to do things slightly differently . If there is no coax joining antenna wire to receiver board , then we have to place the receiver board up at the top of the machine and extend the antenna wire vertically , straight up , a distance of about 138 mm from the surface of the receiver board . The " ground plane " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all 138mm long that are soldered to the ground on your receiver pcb ( close to the bottom of the vertical wire ) . The four wires are dressed outwards horizontally , or better , bending downwards about 30 deg or so , and in four different directions like the points of the compass . The length of these wires are to be trimmed so that the distance from the bottom end of the vertical radiating wire to the tip of each horizontal radial wire is about 138mm . That 's about all there is to it . <p> If there is coax , post again and I 'll suggest how to handle that . <p> I 'm guessing that you may not be happy with having an antenna wire stick up above the machine . There are many other ways to do an antenna , but that is the simplest and most reliable , electrically speaking . <p> Thanks , I will have to take a closer look at the unit with what you have said in mind . The receiver does n't have a coax connection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is about 1.25 " , but probably about 6 " or 8 " uncoiled . Would it help to extend this wire to 138mm &amp; run it vertically ? Here are some shots of what I am working with . No view of the inside of the machine though . Not much horiz. room , so if I can just extend the wire , it would be best . <p> In a situation like this , the best you can do is uncoil the wire , and add on to it to make approximately 140mm mm long and then do some trial and error tests to see how you can arrange the wire inside the unit to give best range . Usually the best thing is to orient the wire so it drapes away from the board as straight as practical in any direction away from internal metal . <p> It is possible to attach a coax cable to your receiver which would make it possible to use an external " rubber duck " style antenna , but it looks like such an external antenna would also get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1/4 wavelength is best ? how about 1/2 wavelength or 280mm ? I ask , because I can run a wire vertically along the front corner &amp; that height is about 12 " . If I run the antenna down the front , I would have to mount the RX up there too , so the wire is n't too long . Know what I mean ? BTW There is a metal plate on the bottom of the unit , so maybe run the wire horiz. along the front top edge ? I guess I need to know if I can go longer with the wire than 1/4 wavelength . I really appreciate your attention to this . Getting this sort of help motivates me to tackle some other electronic projects . Thanks , kev <p> We are guessing what feedpoint impedance the designers had in mind when they made that little coil of wire , but the safest bet is to keep the impedance relatively low . If you use a half wavelength of wire and connect the end of that to the receiver , you are likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So if you want to try a dipole , you must use two quarter wave lengths of wire , connect one to the antenna point and the other to board ground and dress them in opposite directions so that the board is in the middle of the antenna . To be clear , you can try any length you like as you will not damage anything and in situations like this , experimentation is necessary anyway . Just be sure that you use a consistent way of measuring the range each time , preferably without cars driving within a few yards of where you testing and people should not be walking between tx and rx.

First highlight in your quote , as far as FETs being *charge controlled* devices , I 've been saying that forever ! Check my posting history and that will be affirmed on this forum or anywhere else I 've posted . A FET is ultimately charge controlled . But at the mAcro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and channels , should we use a constant voltage source , or constant current ? A CVS works better for FETs , and a CCS better for bjt 's . Hence the terms current &amp; voltage controlled . <p> Second bold highlight , you keep referring to " voltage fields " , and I ask you where that comes from . In all fields texts in EE &amp; physics , there are E , D , B , &amp; H fields . What on earth is a voltage field ? In a bjt , the amplification takes place with both current and voltage , just as a FET . The transport of electrons from emitter to collector is what we call transistor action , since the base is so thin , carriers go right through and reach the collector . Otherwise it is just 2 back to back diodes . The current gain is due to transport as I just mentioned . The voltage gain is due to the small b-e voltage drop needed since a forward p-n junction exhibits large current swings with only small voltage swings . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FET . Ultimately a bjt is charge controlled as well . I 've been saying this for years . <p> I 've always stated that bjt &amp; FET are charge controlled at the mIcro level . The CC &amp; VC models are only black box 1st order models , not meant to explain atomic interaction . <p> Third bold statement in your quote - sure voltage controlled FETs need charge , but to say " not current " is incorrect . How does the charge reach the device if we do n't transport it there ? We have to move charges into and out of the device . That charge motion time derivative is current . When you say " we need *charge* , *not current* , you are contradicting yourself . You treat current as if you wish it did n't exist , acknowledging it but downplaying its role entirely . Current is just dq/dt where q is charge . Do you know the related math ? Have you had calculus , differential equations , fields , etc. ? <p> All electrical devices in the universe need I &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , but not more so . So we appear to agree that at the mIcro level , the charge control model is best for both FET &amp; bjt . At the mAcro level we regard the voltage control FET model &amp; the current control bjt model to be 1st order approximations based on black box behavior , NOT on semi physics . No point in arguing further .

The power factor is the cosine of the angle . It also helps to log the current and the leading or lagging status of the current in case you want to total them up . Adding two loads means finding the vector sum of the two and the power factor is again the cosine of the resulting angle . 77974 @qwx697974

This means you can use thicker wire . The thicker wire will have a lower resistance and it will not heat up as much and at the same time it will allow a higher current to flow . But the first two factors are the major contributors . From here you can go on to all sorts of discussions such as PWM , adjusting the voltage , adding a gearbox , etc etc etc .

Would some one give me some examples such that I can fully understand this topic . <p> It just seems to be mostly about how two different things are really just different aspects of the same thing stemming or inverses of each other . Supposedly stemming from electricity and magnetism being two different aspects of the same physical phenomena . <p> Most of it seems more like just people liking to classify and group things and does't seem too important , except for the part about electricity and magnetism being two aspects of the same force . <p> Thank you for your information about Princeple of Dulity , the website I had been visited before but no help for me to understand this topic.I need some of examples circuitry to do the conversion or white paper such that I can fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the basics , so let 's see if we can build on that a little here . <p> When it comes to electrical circuits , " duality " is defined on the basis of *mesh* and *nodal* equations : Two circuits are said to be " duals " of each other if the mesh equations of one circuit have the same form as the nodal equations of the other circuit . They are said to be " exact duals " if the numerical values of the variables of the two systems are the same . <p> Simply put , one system is defined in terms of currents like i1 , i2 , while the other system is defined in terms of voltages like v1 , v2 . If the two systems are duals , the voltage variables v1 and v2 will appear in the equations where the first system had i1 and i2 , respectively . <p> We could probably draw up something like a low pass filter using an R and C and voltage source and then come up with a dual circuit . I 'm not sure if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edited : Sep 4 , 2010 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Thanks you for your information talking about princeple of duality.I know the princeple of duality just you talked about at this forum.I need some of circuit examples such that I can fully understand princeple of duality at electronic field and do some testing.Have you some of duality circuitry examples post at this forum ? <p> It 's not an important or relevant concept . That 's why you wo n't find much on it . THe problem is there 's just nothing to understand about it . It 's just people grouping similar things together . In electronics have things that complimentary to each other so people like to group them . The grouping exists , but does n't help in the understanding of anything , or any applications . It does not help in the understanding the individual concepts of electricity , magnetism , voltage , current , resistance , etc . <p> It 's like grouping elements on the periodic table by what colour they are ... you can do it , but it does n't  help in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception though , and that is the concept of duality in digital logic circuits . That actually is useful because it 's a actually a math thereom that helps in the formulation of boolean equations . <p> Thanks you for your replied about the Priceple of Duality.My ideal is that I am a electronic design engineer on telecommunication product company , some product has design limit for example spacing , if I can fully understand Duality at electronic , I can change a part of circuitry using princeple of duality to fulfill the spacing design limit ( changing high voltage 400VDC and high value 1000uF E cap to a coil ) so I want to understand this topic.Do you know where I can get this material ? <p> Circuit1 : A voltage source E in series with a resistor R also in series with a capacitor C. The voltage across the cap is vC . <p> Circuit2 : A current source in parallel to a conductance G also in parallel to an inductor L. The current through the inductor is iL <p> In circuit 1 we had E , R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in circuit 2 we had I , G , and L , and looked at iL . The circuit 2 elements are related to circuit 1 elements as : I=E R=1/R L=C iL=vC <p> So to convert to the new circuit we would use a current source equal to E amps , a resistor equal to 1/R , and an inductor equal to C , and the output would be iL . The response iL(t) would be the same as the voltage response vC(t) . <p> Example : We have three elements in series , a voltage source E=1v peak , R=100 ohms , and C=100uf , and the dual is a circuit with three elements in parallel , a current source I=1 amp peak , R=1/100 ohms , and L=100uH . The response of the voltage across the cap in circuit 1 is the same as the current through the inductor in circuit 2 . With a frequency of 100Hz , the cap voltage ( circuit 1 ) is about 157mv and the inductor current ( circuit 2 ) is about 157mA . <p> This illustrates that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circuit using an inductor you have to use the same value inductor as the capacitor , a resistance equal to the reciprocal of the original resistance , and change the voltage source to a current source . <p> Does that help ? <p> It might help more if you told us exactly what circuit you are dealing with and what you want to change to save space or money . In many cases a dual circuit will not work for a number of reasons , even if you swap exactly , because there are other characteristics that change when you go from a cap to an inductor . It really has a lot to do with the actual application . <p> Last edited : Sep 5 , 2010 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Thanks you MrAl , It is very detail to explain the Princeple of Duality for me , I will review Mesh and Nodal analysis such that I can easy to do the circuit change.At your replied you said even I do correct conversion at the circuitry , sometime it does not work exactly I want.Would you mind explian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are differences in the inductor compared to the capacitor such as series resistance which could be high for the inductor , so you 'd have to take those secondary effects into account also . It 's not just a matter of replacing the cap with an inductor , you 'd have to look at the circuit very carefully to make sure it worked good enough . Also , it 's not easy to make a current source if you already have a voltage source when dealing with power . <p> You really need to post your circuit so we can take a better look and advise more precisely . <p> Last edited : Sep 5 , 2010 77974 @qwx697974 
@@71811908 @511908/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> How to use FFT in LTspice <p> OK , so over in this other thread they 're picking my poor li'l 3-transistor headphone amplifier apart , doing all kinds of FFT stuff with it and all . So I 'd like to be able to do the same , just to be able to keep up there . <p> Now , I know about the FFT viewer , but I really do n't know how to use it . And , as usual , the online help is of absolutely no help . What they say is this : <p> 3 . Display the Fourier Transform of a Trace . <p> You can use the menu command View=&gt;FFT to perform a Fast Fourier transform on various data traces . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Followed by a screenshot of the FFT dialog . WTF ? ? ? ? ? <p> So I know how to select the trace to perform the FFT analysis on . That 's easy . <p> I know I can select the " number of data point samples in time " , although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that more is better ( but may also take more time to simulate ) . <p> " Binomial Smoothing done before FFT and windowing/Number of points " ? Right over my head . ( Default is 3 . ) <p> Now we come to the worst part : the Windowing Function . Not only do I have no frigging idea what this is , but I now have a dizzying array of choices : <p> Bartlett <p> Bartlett-Hann <p> Blackman <p> Blackmann-Harris <p> Blackman-Nuttall <p> Bohman <p> Cosine <p> etc. , etc. , etc . <p> Are any of these guys available on-line to ask them how to use their algorithm ? ( Just kidding . ) <p> So I would very much appreciate it if anyone could point me to a set of choices here that works and will allow me to see the distribution of harmonics in my little amp 's output . ( Or to a decent explanation of how to use this function . ) <p> I guess LTspice is like a lot of similar software packages : extremely powerful , widely used , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are carbonzit , this link should answer all your questions about the window function . <p> For what you want I do n't think there 's much difference but I 've never looked at the real differences between the various functions available , I 've always visually been pleased with the Blackmann-Harris . The number of sample points is hyper critical to the resolution you get , the bigger the number the more resolution you 'll get but the longer it takes to render RF simulations can take a LONG time to run due to the high frequency , your audio circuit should be fine even with high sampling relative to the frequencies you 're interested in . Binomal smoothing is in the case of the default takes three samples and applies an algorithm to smooth their values out a bit , helps avoid complex noise issues that can arise from math errors in simulations , try before and after to see if it helps with a rendering that makes more sense . <p> In the case of the FFT function in LTSpice being poorly documented , it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they work will understand all the options that are presented . I mean the LTSpice does n't have help information on the function of a diode , or the details of transistor operation , nor are things like voltage resistance and current explained for obvious reasons , the help file would basically be every Wikipedia entry on electronics = ) <p> I found a good site a week ago that had a good explanation of how the FFT algoryhtm works and how the sample/window size effects time/frequency resolution but unfortunately I 've lost it . 77966 @qwx697966 <p> As Sceadwian noted , the LTspice documentation is designed to help you use the functions available , not to give a tutorial about the functions . FFT 's are a big subject all by themselves and if you do n't know " WTF " the options are , then some appropriate searching and reading about the subject is in order . Do n't expect LTspice to do that for you , especially since it 's a free program . It 's a poor carpenter who blames his tools . <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now what do I do with it ? <p> I can clearly see the harmonic spikes , but what I 'm after , in this case , is a figure of merit ( it would be nice if I could compute THD , or something close to it ) . Are there any tools that let me do this ? Something that will concentrate on the frequencies of interest ( 1KHz and its multiples ) and compute their relative magnitudes ? <p> Alternatively , I guess I could use the window 's cursors to look at the first n harmonics and hand-compute THD ( or something close to it ) . <p> hi cz , I realise that you do n't  want to read up in detail about FFT analysis , but its very important you get to grips with the basics . I have searched the web for what I would consider to be primers in FFT , which IMHO you should study else you will forever be asking questions . <p> Thanks ( although I 'm not sure how helpful someone else 's Google search is : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a search field myself , you know ) . I think I know enough about FFT analysis to proceed . It 's not lack of knowledge of FFT that 's holding me back here : it 's the specific question I asked ( which you did n't answer ) , which is how do I derive a value for THD from the plot shown above ? Which at this point is really more of a LTspice question than a FFT theory question . I know what the plot represents ; it 's basically a histogram showing the frequency distribution of the output signal of the amplfiier . I need to somehow convert that to a single figure of merit ( total harmonic distortion ) . <p> Now , I 'm not necessarily expecting there to be some ready-made , click-and-you're-done solution for this in LTspice ( though it would be nice to know if one exists ) . But since I 'm ignorant of so much of its operation , I ask here in hopes that someone , like yourself , who 's much more knowledgable about this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to sit down with paper , pencil and calculator and go through all those harmonic peaks to compute THD . <p> The fundamental should have a level of 0dB but yours is 30dB lower . The 2nd harmonic is a little more than 40dB ( 1% distortion ) less than the fundamental so is about 3% distortion and the 3rd harmonic is maybe at 6% distortion . I would guess the total distortion is 15% which is horrible . <p> The actual distortion percentage is the amplitude of all the harmonics added together divided by the amplitude of the fundamental . The number does n't matter since 1% distortion sounds awful to most people and most hi-fi 's have distortion less than 0.05% . <p> Now , if you could tell me how I could derive this number from that LTspice plot shown above , that would be helpful . <p> LONG ... <p> I went ahead and searched the web a bit , and what do you know ? I found a helpful tool for THD calculation . It 's an Excel spreadsheet ( attached below ) from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So here 's what I did : <p> 1 . Measured the magnitudes of all the harmonic peaks ( in dB ) in the FFT plot above ( listed below ) . 2 . Normalized them to the fundamental by subtracting the magnitude of the fundamental from each . 3 . Plugged the numbers into Fred 's spreadsheet . ( 2nd attached spreadsheet is the one with the results . ) <p> Result ? According to his sheet , my THD is a little over 6% . <p> Maybe someone can check my work here ( and his spreadsheet , which is pretty simple . ) <p> Hmm , looks like I ca n't attach . xls files . Anyhow , you can get the spreadsheet from the site I linked to above if you want it . You can just plug in the numbers above ( the right-hand normalized ones ) to see my result . <p> I ca n't comment on your methods , but they appear solid without analyzing the math , I 'll leave that up to people actually qualified . If those are your results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1khz is .. beyond wretched . I 'm almost thinking the first attempts at reproducing audio on wax were better . 77966 @qwx697966 <p> I ca n't comment on your methods , but they appear solid without analyzing the math , I 'll leave that up to people actually qualified . If those are your results though that 's pretty sad . THD of 6% at 1khz is .. beyond wretched . I 'm almost thinking the first attempts at reproducing audio on wax were better . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Yes , it is a terrible extremely simple amplifier with LOTS of distortion . <p> Typical of you , AG : you comment on some side issue . What I 'm trying to resolve here is how to computer THD , not whether some particular amplifier sucks or not . ( The whole point of the exercise being to attempt to make this amplifier suck less . ) <p> So to address Sceadwian 's comment , do you think this method of computation is valid ? at least close ? If you look at that spreadsheet , you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulas used : <p> 1 . He computes " power " from each harmonic 's dB value : 10 ( dB/10 ) 2 . He adds the powers to get their sum ( THD by power ) 3 . He computes THD% ( " by voltage " ) as 100 * sqrt ( sum of powers ) <p> Would any of us consider buying any amplifier with an advertised THD of 6% ? Of course not ! That 's not the point . <p> Regarding the distortion level of old acoustic recordings ( wax and shellac ) , my guess , having listened to a number of them , is that distortion in them was way higher than 10 or 20% . Lots of clipping , ringing , etc . Yet they were considered a major miracle when they were first heard . <p> I have never made an extremely simple amplifier that has lots of distortion ( all of mine had very low distortion ) but I have heard many that other people have bought or made . Excellent and inexpensive IC amplifiers have been available for about 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us consider buying any amplifier with an advertised THD of 6% ? Of course not ! 77968 @qwx697968 <p> But I bet many amps with 6% distortion are sold ( without , of course , having that feature advertised ) ! 77973 @qwx697973 <p> Dang , think about those horrible distortion-generators known as " cell phones " . The other day I heard someone carrying on a conversation where I could hear both sides quite loudly , if not clearly . The phone sounded like nothing so much as what we used to call " squawk boxes " . And people put up with that crap ! <p> ( Of course , that was some fancy-schmancy class D amplifier , not a simple , humble " analog " one made from antique 3-legged devices ... ) <p> I draw your attention LONG ... It looks as though manufacturers of audio equipment can cherry-pick their method of measuring THD to give the most favourable ( lowest ) figure ! Does anyone out there know if the ' dB ' in LTSpice 's FFT plot is voltage dB or power dB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Last edited : Aug 1 , 2011 77973 @qwx697973 <p> LTspice shows output voltage , not output power . To calculate the total distortion you must add the levels of each harmonic . If there is no distortion then there are no harmonics . <p> Speakers and amplifiers have their power ratings exaggerated by stating impossible Peak Music Power or Maximum power . Some amplifiers have their output power rating calculated by the age of the designer 's grandmother squared . <p> Since the number of harmonics tends towards infinity ( albeit in theory and they will be of pretty low amplitude by the time you get to 100 or so ) , is it practical to include all harmonics in a THD calculation ? I bet the commercial pragmatic approach is ' ignore anything beyond the nth harmonic ' , where n is an arbitrary low number ! 77973 @qwx697973 <p> @carbonzit I 've just found another thread discussing the . four directive , which let 's LTSpice calculate THD for you !

This involves a set of pre-settable up/down counters where you load the number to be subtracted from into the counters ( minuend ) first , then pulse ' down ' the entire count of the number to be subtracted . If another set of counters is used to store the subtrahend , the first set can be pulsed while the second set is also pulsed and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extract the result from the first set . Using a high frequency this can be fast , but it will of course be slower for a large number of BCD digits .

@@71811917 @511917/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Is a DC-motor an inductive load ? <p> I had a discussion with a friend about loads . He said to me that anything which operated on DC is a resistive load - Never inductive . So now I ask : What about a brushed DC-motor ? Is n't that an inductive load ? Now I ask you as well - Maybe you can help educating me a bit . I 'm sure he 's right , but why ? <p> He 's not right . In reality everything is a little bit of everything else since nothing is ideal ( resistance , capacitance , inductance ) . But ideally ... <p> If a brushed motor was a resistive load , then it would fry whenever you hooked up a power supply across it because the winding resistance is so low . BUt it does n't . A DC brushed motor accepts DC current , but inside the rotating brushes are commutating ( switching the DC current back and forth across the windings ) so that if you measured the voltage across the individual windings you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would see a AC waveform ( not necessarily the pure sinusoid AC waveform you get from the mains , more likely to be a trapzoidal waveform but AC nonetheless with no AC component ) . <p> THe winding inductance is slowing down the rise time of the current in the winding which is trying to reach to " infinite " due to the low resistance of the motor windings . But before it can reach " infinite " ( a level of current that would fry the motor ) the brushes commutate the current to another winding . <p> What it 's actually doing is for every winding it is switching the voltage polarity of the winding to reverse the current flow so that it decreases to zero before it gets too high . BUt once it reaches zero it starts increasing in the opposite direction . The voltage polarity is reversed again before this gets too high ( assuming the motor is running under allowable operating conditions ) . BUt it is doing this in a sequence so it appears as though the positive voltage across windings is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative voltage is moving in the opposite direction across the windings taking the empty place the winding that the other polarity left behind . <p> If there is too much load on the motor the motor is spinning too slowly and the current polarity is n't reversed fast enough and is given too much time to rise to a level that overheats the motor . In the absolute worst case ( stall ) then , yeah , it appears as a resistive load since the inductance will allow the DC current flow through a single winding to eventually reach a level where the current is now limited by the resistance and thus no longer rises meaning the inductance then appears as a short . <p> A spinning motor generates a back EMF which acts to reduce current flow from the locked rotor value . <p> An inductance generates a voltage , e , which equals -L + " i/+ " t , with L being inductance in henries , + " i being the change in current and + " t being the change in time that the change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the inductor tries to maintain the circuit current through itself by forcing a voltage through the circuitry ; the coil voltage polarity changes from + to - . <p> Neglecting the effect of parasitic coil capacitance , for a 1 h coil , for a change in i of 2 amp over a time duration of 3 mS you get a 1300 v spike .

A variation in the load does n't necessarily mean the load is inductive . You could , for example , switch a resistor in and out of the circuit which would provide a load variation , but it would still be a purely resistive load ( ignoring any parasitic inductance of the resistor ) . <p> DC loads have a power factor of 1 .

If you want devices that are labeled properly and reliable then you need to buy from a reputable vendor . <p> Regarding resistors , yes the wattage is pretty well related to size ( unless the resistor in mounted on a heat sink ) , since it 's the area of the component that radiates the heat away and , for a given wattage , you need a given area to keep the temperature at a safe level . To determine the wattage just look in a catalog of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should tell you the wattage of the devices you have . <p> Well , you can always try to stress them . Operate them at 1/2 W for a few days and see if they change value or take a look at the temperature of the resistors and a known 1/2 Watt resistor operating at 1/2 W. <p> You can also CYA by making sure the same package size is availabe in the wattage you need from a reputable vendor . <p> Post #3 - to an extent a " value " is depenmdent on what you want from it .... in general , components are " acceptable standards " which means reasonably reliable . If you are building ( old hobby-hores comes into view ) a 400 year working electronic clock , then you derate components so they are " more reliable " - but in practice this means " Less stressed " - since even wirewould resistors can fail - due to nicks in the wire when made , or an encapsulated part can fail due to stress when the encapsulant shrinks . Sometimes these effect can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relays that had be specially commissioned ( in a hurry ! ) and digging further it seemed the coli winders were in the habit of eating oranges , then washing their hands before commencing work , but due to the " rush " this was not always the case and some " spray " managed to get into the windings - not something that would be noticed if it was at a much lower level - so your components may be " programmed to fail " It is things like this that make a 400year electronic clock unlikely to survive . The clock at Wells Cathederal is about this age and still going .

It 's cold resistance is 10-15X less than when hot . Hence the larger voltage at start-up . <p> In a rapid-start lamp , the metal reflector plays an important part . Initially the current path is ionizing the gas at the ends of the tube to the reflector . As the gas ionizes , the GLOW spreads along the tube , because the ionized gas is more conductive . Eventually the entire tube lights and the ballast just limits the current . <p> In a non-rapid start lamp , the initial ionization is caused from electrons from the heated filament .

Capacitors can discharge their energy VERY fast so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no hard cutoff point for lethality or danger as it 's all dependent on how it 's discharged into a person . <p> Last edited : Apr 16 , 2009 77966 @qwx697966 <p> When you say dangerous that could mean potential to cause harm . A small spark in an explosive situation ( near gasoline for example ) could be dangerous . Let 's assume your concern is electrocution . We 'll further assume that electrocution means your heart could stop . <p> My memory may be faulty but I thought that 20 milliamps was the threshold of current that if passing thru or near the heart could cause it to fail . I may be incorrect in the value but let 's just assume I am correct . <p> The flow of current depends on the load resistance and the voltage available . A quick google revealed that the resistance of the human body might be 100,000 ohms for contact with dry skin dropping to 300 ohms with good , intimate contact ( most skin , exposed flesh , conductor imbedded in skin ) . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ info until we have something better . <p> With a threshold of 20 milliamps and a resistance of 100,000 ohms we 'd need 2,000 volts of potential . If the resistance is 300 ohms then 6 volts potential is sufficient . <p> What I did n't do here is account for the limited time that the potential exists as the capacitor discharges . <p> Again , the data may not be quite right but I hoped to illustrate that the answer to your question is quite dependent on conditions . Stick the ends of the capacitor leads thru your skin and it could turn deadly . You might not want to do that but you could do it by accident . <p> You said , " dangerous " . Danger has infinite forms . Ancillary damage could occur from the " startle response " , or involuntary muscle contraction . You could jerk back , letting fly the screwdriver in your hand and impaling the cat ... or your mother-in-law . ( Hmmm ... That might be worth a jolt ! ) Seriously , I 've had caps explode and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes " here . ) If you 're thinking of playing a joke on someone , just make REAL sure you can outrun her boyfriend ! ! ( Voice of experience ! ) <p> DC is generally regarded to be much safer than AC , 60VAC will give you quite a shock and 60VDC will only shock you if you have damp skin . <p> Capacitors are always charged with DC voltages and there is a limited amount of energy stored in the capacitor . Obviously the larger the capacitor , the higher the voltage , the greater the risk of a lethal shock becomes . <p> A really small capacitor charged to a high voltage will not kill you , for example a 100pF capacitor charged to 10kV will only give you a mild static shock . A much larger capacitor charged to a lower voltage is much more likely to kill you : a 1000:mu:F capacitor charged to 350V will cause far more harm than that tiny 100pF capacitor even though the voltage is much higher . <p> I read somewhere that capacitors are only really dangerous if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage you will receive a shock but it 's unlikely to kill you . I do n't know what the lethal capacitance is , it 's probably more about energy than anything else . 77972 @qwx697972 77975 @qwx697975 <p> 150VDC will kill you . You are confusing low amperage supplies with true 150VDC . It 's a bit like stating that the 20kV from a spark plug wo n't kill you - of course it wo n't because when you conduct it to ground the voltage is greatly reduced . An 11kV overhead line will turn you to carbon . <p> If my memory serves me correctly , anything over 48V is considered lethal in the UK . On farms I believe it is 25V ! ! That wet mud sure does conduct well . ( bit of artistic ( argumentative ) license there , it 's actually because bigger animals conduct better and so can be killed by lower voltages. )

If 120 mV of DC potential exists from one point on my tongue to the other , then there should be a polarity change when I swap leads . There is no polarity change when I do so .

Yet the DC experiment on my body does not prove where sources of higher potential exist vs lower potential . Furthermore , the test is n't repeatable . After turning my meter off and back on and retesting , the voltages I read changed . <p> The problem with this discussion is a failure to recognize how a voltmeter functions and what is required for a reliable measurement .

This " hum " is in the middle of EMG frequency range ; we ca n't filter it . " Conclusion . Even with specifically designed equipment with filtering and tailored response , muscle voltages using surface techniques ( which requires electrolyte gel applied at the electrode site ) are only in the 5 mV range .

A more complex device of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( US Patent 1671970 ) . 6 <p> When two different metals are suspended in an electrolyte solution , direct current flowing one way through the solution sees less resistance than in the other direction . Electrolytic rectifiers most commonly used an aluminum anode and a lead or steel cathode , suspended in a solution of tri-ammonium ortho-phosphate . <p> The rectification action is due to a thin coating of aluminum hydroxide on the aluminum electrode , formed by first applying a strong current to the cell to build up the coating . The rectification process is temperature-sensitive , and for best efficiency should not operate above 86 -F ( 30 -C ) . There is also a breakdown voltage where the coating is penetrated and the cell is short-circuited . Electrochemical methods are often more fragile than mechanical methods , and can be sensitive to usage variations which can drastically change or completely disrupt the rectification processes . <p> Similar electrolytic devices were used as lightning arresters around the same era by suspending many aluminium cones in a tank of tri-ammomium ortho-phosphate solution . Unlike the rectifier above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was no polarization and thus no rectifier action , but the chemistry was similar. 7 <p> The modern electrolytic capacitor , an essential component of most rectifier circuit configurations was also developed from the electrolytic rectifier . <p> I am not sure if its appropriate location to place the capacitor . I thought that instead of placing the RC snubber accross the IGBT/FET like the standard method , if I place it as shown above , I could eliminate need of R. Please not that unlike conventional system where we need to eliminate parasitic inductances , in this case I have an inductive source . <p> The generator is rated at 15KW ( but since the system is rather old , we will be running it around 10 KW ) . Its 400V line to line output . There is no motor , The dummy load shown is a heater coil .

Any more questions ? <p> The energy stored in the winding -+LI- will be converted to energy stored in the capacitor -+CV- minus resistive losses incurred while charging the capacitor . The rectifier diode will limit ringing but the resistance of the winding is probably very low so , in its current configuration , the capacitor surge current charging the capacitor is effectively the same amount of current flowing in the winding . At 40A , the capacitor will charge in about 1 millisecond . When the IGBT switches back on , it will discharge through the load in the same amount of time . <p> Electrolytic capacitors do n't stand up to such treatment very well . <p> I somehow do n't believe the 2A ripple current measurement can be accurate . A power resistor is usually put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and damp oscillations in whatever LC tank is present . Even with one in place , you may need more ripple current capacity than a reasonably sized electrolytic can deliver . I 'd try four 100-F 400V caps wired 2x2 to provide the equivalent of an 800V 100-F with double the ripple current capacity if I had them but I still have my doubts . <p> I think 100-F of capacitance is probably about right for snubbing but a basic 400V 100-F electrolytic wo n't cut it .

@@71811934 @511934/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> The datasheet for an opamp shows its voltage gain vs frequency when it has no negative feedback . For a very slow LM324 with a supply that is 10V to 15V the typical gain is 400,000 forom DC to about 2Hz , then the gain drops for higher frequencies . At 1kHz the typical gain is about 250 .

The gain is reduced so that the phase shift in the opamp does not cause oscillation when negative feedback is used . Oscillation will occur when the phase shift causes negative feedback to be positive feedback at a high frequency when there is gain at that frequency . <p> Is it possible to get gain of 1000 in a LM324 or OP07 practically ? If not why ? What gain can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx697968 <p> Hi Lahari , there is no theoretical restriction - but , certainly , a practical one . An opamp could - theoretically - be operated without feedback at its maximum gain - provided that there is no offset ! But this never can be ensured in practice . Therefore , negative feedback is necessary to bias the device in its linear region - more or less independent on offset effects . In addition , negative feedback offers some other important advantages : * less sensitivity to active tolerances ( open-lop gain , temperature and offset effects ) * less sensitive to supply voltage variations * less distortions ( better THD ) * larger bandwidth * smaller output resistance ( better voltage source properties ) * Disadvantage : Increased tendency to oscillations ( less phase margin ) . * Comment : The reduced gain due to negative feedback is no real " disadvantage " , because this reduction is desired and leeds to less sensitivity of the final gain value to open-loop gain variations ( uncertainty ) . <p> so ... if you look at the frequency vs gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60db ( gain of 1000 ) , you will see that you would have a gain of 1000 up to 1khz , and after 1khz , the gain would drop off at 20db/decade. if you want a gain of 1000 up to 20khz , you need an op amp with 20Mhz unity gain bandwidth . this can be calculated very simply with Acl*Fbw=GBW or ( 1000*20khz ) =20Mhz where Acl is the desired closed loop gain , and Fbw is the desired bandwidth of the amplifier and GBW is the minimum gain-bandwidth product of the op amp . <p> The datasheet for an opamp shows its voltage gain vs frequency when it has no negative feedback .

What you are describing is an LM358 ( or similar ) in an application where the designer did n't  know how to use it . That 's when the ' problems ' show up .

Some people think an old awful-sounding AM radio sounds fine . <p> Well all i am saying is if it is designed right in the first place ( and within the limits of the device ) it works ok . Not the audiophiles choice perhaps , but done right it wont matter that much . <p> It 's a matter of choice . If it works within reason , why not use it . <p> " Poor bandwidth " is still not exactly the real picture . It has 1MHz unity gain bandwidth which is a lot higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That means a gain of 10 at 100kHz as long as the output voltage is limited accordingly . <p> There are better transistors there are worse transistors , there are better LEDs there are worse LEDs , there are better op amps there are worse op amps .

Small irregularitites in the wire , due to the manufacturing standards , may cause each individual section of the wire to " perform " differently than the other sections . Also , ambient air temperature can play a major role in the fluctuation of the " breaking point .

Fuses are rated to not only blow at certain currents , but to also include a time factor .

With a piece of suitably rated wire you just ca n't be sure of the exact protection level given , it ' might ' even offer a greater level of protection ? . <p> I 'd say it 's an " all depends on " kind of answer as is suggested in some of the responses . If the consequences of a home made fuse are not extreme - and the systems or components that need protection are properly protected then the thin wire might be acceptable . <p> An example of where I might use just such an arrangement - on my workbench with a power supply that is properly protected and wired for higher current levels ( let 's say 5 amps ) I might use the thin wire to let go at 3 amps just to keep from replacing 5 amp fuses however I 'd be certain that the operation of the fuse ( melting of the wire ) does n't result in a dangerous arc or spray of vaporized metal . I 'd only do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really are n't sure then avoid doing this . Safety is most important . <p> Just to throw another thought into the pot ... this concept is exactly that which is applied in the use of a " fusible link " as found for many years in most automobiles . In that application , a circuit designed for a given load and wired with a given gauge wire was protected by a short and easily replaced length of lighter-gauge wire . For example , a circuit wired with 12-gauge wire might be protected at the source by a 16-gauge link . Thus , the highest current that will flow in the circuit is governed by the capacity of the link . <p> These links were generally not standard primary wire , however . In many cases , the links were more flexible than standard wire , and another difference is that the wire would often melt through without visibly damaging the jacket of the wire . This made continuity testing necessary rather than simply being able to confirm an open link visibly . <p> It should be noted however that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire , and gone to the more predictable maxi-fuses instead . <p> Guess I should of mentioned where I have been using it ? ? I 'm currently an EE student and just finished Physics II , unfortunately that is the extent of my knowledge with electronics , but any how I 've built a little lab in my bedroom and have been running some various experiments using my variac as a power supply . The variac has a 10 amp fuse , but after one of my homemade experiments blew the fuse , I 've been using the 41 awg wire to prevent me from doing this again . I 'm still using the 10 amp fuse in the variac , but also the homemade fuse in series . So I 'm not really using the wire to protect my circuits , but instead my variac . My main concern with using the 41 and 44 awg wire , is the resistance of the wire effecting any thing ? I 'm not sure how the resistance of my fuse may compare to a real fuse ? It just seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a good thing ? <p> I 've ran several experiments on the home made fuse , and found that regardless of the voltage , the wire tends to blow around the same current levels . And far as consistency between batches , I have a two pound spool of each , so I have miles and miles of wire to work with .

I want to measure as much current as I can . If there 's a trade off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> There is always a trade-off in any measurement between the maximum that can be measured and the sensitivity . Saying you want to measure as much as you can tells me nothing . It depends upon the dynamic range of your measuring system , the noise floor , and the desired measurement resolution of the minimum current . You need to determine these . <p> So how you going to measure the current value ( after it 's converted to voltage ) and what are you doing with the measurement ? <p> OK you have a few options . I 'll attach a few pictures as examples . The first and likely cheapest option is a current transformer and one of those is the first image . These are sometimes called donuts . They consist of a coil of wire that your conductor passes through ( only a single conductor ) . These devices have numbers on them like in the picture . The picture is a 50/5 meaning when the conductor passing through it is carrying 50 Amps the output wires deliver 5 Amps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old analog meters and many still do but they can also drive digital meters with very low input impedance . Their ratios can vary as I use many that are 1,000/5 to measure the current on 3 phase 480 VAC buses . They are simple and rugged devices and their use comes with a cost of how accurate they are and what is called " Burden Voltage " . Google is your friend . <p> The next device pictured is a current transducer . This is a different animal and a more costly animal . Again the current travels along a conductor passing through the device but the current is measured using a hall effect device to measure the magnetic field around the sensor again here Google is your friend . This device outputs a small current of 4 to 20 mA which is proportional to the current being measured . The device is pretty cool in that it has 3 ranges selectable with a top jumper . It can measure 0 to 10 , 0 to 20 and 0 to 50 Amps . The device is loop powered meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in series with it . <p> Both of these devices are marketed by countless businesses like CR Magnetics . I only use CR Magnetics as an example . The Current Transformer pictured is made by Simpson Electric Company and the Current Transducer by Neilsen-Kuljian . <p> The outputs are scaled for reading . If I have a Current Transformer like pictured that is 50/5 I know that 5 Amps out is actually 50 Amps . Therefore if I take an analog meter that is 5 Amps FS ( Full Scale ) I can paint or draw a linear scale on the meter face of 0 to 50 . The same can be done with a digital indicator device depending on the device . The Current Transducer is about the same . If I set it up to measure 0 to 50 Amps the output will be 4 to 20 mA proportional to the input . <p> Hope that helps a little as it is brief but an overview . <p> Note : The order is screwed up for the attached files .

@@71811942 @511942/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Speed control of a universal motor <p> I need a cheap beefy adjustable speed motor setup for a DIY lathe I 'm building . I was considering using a universal motor perhaps from a table saw or other source of large universal motor . I 've been told that universal motors only operate at high speed and I know that they are almost exclusively used for high speed applications ( table saws , angle grinders , dremel tools , blenders , etc ) but I do n't see why it could n't be made to run at lower speed by controlling the power to it . <p> So my plan is to use an encoder or DC analog tach to read the speed of the motor and build a cricuit that would read the speed , compare it to setpoint , and use proportional control to adjust a phase angle firing triac/SSR to maintain a constant speed as the load changes . <p> In my mind , this seems like it would work . But there 's the potential issue of my motor likely being designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed down around 500RPM ( or maybe more , if need be I can use mechanical gear reduction , but that only goes so far ) . <p> From what I understand about series wound motors , they are more or less " constant mechanical HP " - that is to say ( possibly not 100% accurately ) that as torque demand increases , RPM drops . So if I were to apply the maximum load that the motor could sustain without burning up and read the speed @ that load , I could call this my " maximum speed " ( 4000rpm for example ) and design my circuit and my machine accordingly . At 75% of this load , I would need to use my phase angle firing circuit to deliver 75% of full load amps and therefore maintain 4000rpm . The purpose of this , would be that if I did not do it this way , I could find myself in a situation where as I 'm increasing the load ( say I 'm running 6000RPM ) and I hit an invisible wall where my motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall off - that 's not good . <p> I 've done a similar thing Strantor , and 500 RPM is totally unsuitable for a 20k RPM universal motor . The nature of series would motors makes them have very low power and/or unstable when under about 1/4 of their normal RPM . <p> You really need a DC motor , pref a shunt wound or perm magnet type . There are a lot available including treadmill motors which are specifically designed for fairly low RPMs . <p> And even with a DC motor 500RPM is far from ideal , so you are better with a DC motor at ( say ) 1500 RPM and 3:1 reduction gearing .

That is , until I start gouging into it with tooling , then I expect the load to increase quite a bit . Then , later , I will be adding a lead screw to it , so it will br driving that as well ( possibly , may use a stepper for that , not sure ) <p> I 've been told elsewhere that treadmill motors are also fairly high RPM ( in the many thousands ) . <p> good to hear from someone who 's tried it , your info will be invaluable . <p> Of course , the universal motor can also be run on DC . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit and follow it up with a PWM speed control just to check things out . If it works well enough , you can add the speed feedback/control later . <p> I am with Dean on this . If the motor runs on DC , then I would use PWM as he suggests . <p> I have used both 3-phase with VFD and DC with PWM for lathe power . They both give good speed control and low-speed torque , but I prefer the DC power for my very small Prazi . You will be in good company . The Monarch 10EE used both DC and VFD 3-phase depending on the model ( http : **37;1547;TOOLONG ) . <p> The major difference between the two types of supply are in the stopping . The little Prazi does not have split nuts for threading , so one needs to stop the lathe -- at least that is how I do it when RH treading to a shoulder . DC provides almost instant stop and start . <p> I would use a 90V 1/2 HP motor with PWM control . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are quite inexpensive and can be found used . Gearboxes are readily available . These motors are also used in Treadmills and high-powered sub-base woofers . E ps : PM me if you would like a copy of my design <p> I have controlled motors with brushes using triacs . Triacs allow adjusting the firing angle to change the power getting to the motor and thus slow it down . You will find a problem at low speed however because the motors do n't  have as much torque as we 'd like . To help this situation you can build a control system with speed measurement and feed that back to the control circuit . That will keep even a slower speed working pretty well , as long as the armature current is not raised too high ( you 'll have to limit that so you do n't  burn up the motor windings ) . <p> I always meant to do this with my Dremel , but it would require taking the whole thing apart to remove the speed control in there already and i did n't  feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedal for the speed control , so i could raise or lower the speed as needed and still have hands free . Funny , sewing machines had this for years <p> Yeah a nice PWM system would work pretty well . Just have to watch the motor current level so it does n't  go too high for too long . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> I have used triac control on a small Unimat lathe with a universal motor . In my opinion , triac control is almost totally unsuitable for speed control on a lathe because of the torque issue . Just try threading or a heavy cut with triac control -- that is , unless you a have a geared motor for very low speed . <p> Of course , the universal motor can also be run on DC . We 're experimenting here , so why not build a beefy rectifier/filter circuit and follow it up with a PWM speed control just to check things out .

I trust you guys and your first hand experience , but I 've been digesting your comments for the past half day and I 'm wondering ( theoretically ) why the universal motor with triac control at low speed is a no-go .

Is it possibly because the little " blips " of on time might not fall cleanly inside a commutation period , instead they may fall between periods and be " wasted " in the form of an arc ; sort of " hit &amp; miss " of the pulses ? <p> Given your rough dimensions and weights you plan to run I doubt that a 1/2 Hp Dc motor is going to be anywhere near capable of running your lathe unless you do n't mind only being able to take a few thousands of an inch cut with each pass which gets old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combo unit that came with a 2 HP DC motor from the factory .

Problem with both is , they wo n't accept &lt;380V .

I do n't want to pay for a transformer , unless I can get one cheap ( which I doubt ) . <p> Actually going from 380 to 480 is cheap and easy . Just use a simple buck boost transformer to make up the difference that way it only has to carry the amp load of the 100 volt boost instead of the full load . My math says something around 1 - 1.5 KVA would easily carry the 100 volt difference to power the 480 volt 5 hp motors . <p> I think a fairly common 120/240 : 120/240 isolation transformer configured right would get you close enough . <p> As far as getting the motors and VFD units apparently either you do n't know the right people or the right places to look ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . There are quite a few new ones for less than $100 that take single-phase input . <p> Edit ; BTW , is this a wood lathe or metal working lathe you are building ? If metal , will you have threading capability ? Will you use half/split nuts on the lead screw ? If you need instant stop , that may affect your choice of control type . <p> Search on VFD Drive and list by price . There are quite a few new ones for less than $100 that take single-phase input . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Yes , I see that . That one and others like it all seem to come from china so I see that as a gamble . I looked at a couple different models and searched around for customer reviews and could n't find much .

I would strongly recommend you buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know that these inexpensive drives exist is probably because when I searched for them previously , I was probably searching by brand name for drives that I was familiar with ( Allen Bradley , Yaskawa , Emerson , Eurotherm ) <p> I 'll give it my due dilligence though and see if I can find a cheap-o that 's being praised by it 's customers . <p> Edit ; BTW , is this a wood lathe or metal working lathe you are building ? If metal , will you have threading capability ? 77968 @qwx697968 <p> It 's a metal lathe and I plant to be able to thread on it . That area ( driving of spindle VS lead screw ) is still up in the air right now . I 'm thinking I might do it seperately , with a servo on the leadscrew . Not quite sure , have to look into my options for gearing . <p> I do n't know . maybe 2 acme nuts with a spring between them ? Can you tell me how does it effect , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The most common thread you will make will be an external , right-hand thread . Internal threads , particularly to a dead end , are considerably more difficult to cut on a lathe , and you may just choose to use a tap . <p> With a normal configuration , cutting a RH thread will involve cutting toward the chuck . Given some pitch , say 28 tpi , your cutter will be moving pretty quickly across the work , and everything stops quite quickly when it hits the chuck . So , you try to avoid doing that . Slow spindle rpm 's help . Half-nuts ( split-nuts ) grab the lead screw and power the carriage . When they are closed , the carriage moves . When they are opened , the carriage stops instantly . Thus , with a little coordination , you can thread toward the chuck or to a shoulder on the piece a not jam the cutter into the chuck/shoulder . <p> The little Prazi I mentioned above does to have half-nuts . You need to stop the lathe from turning and withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thread . A DC motor will typically stop of faster than a 3-phase motor . That is why I used a DC motor in that application . After making this thing:View attachment 64913 I decided that relying on my old eyes and coordination was too much . So , I then made a little gadget working off an electronic dial gauge to detect " zero " ( i.e. , the last thread ) and stop the motor so I could concentrate on withdrawing the cross-slide to give a nice taper to the end of the thread . <p> An alternative to threading toward the chuck for RH threads , is to reverse the spindle and thread off the backside away from the chuck . In theory , you might consider just turning the cutter upside down on the front side with the lathe reversed , but that will tend to lift the cutter and carriage from the bed , and most lathes are not built rigidly for that . In designing your lathe , you might consider sizing it to allow cutting off the back side . My Prazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " diameter that way . <p> One other thing . In threading , if you disconnect the lead screw , as with half-nuts , you will need a way to re-establish where to start the thread relative to the leadscrew and spindle . That is what the " thread dial " on a lathe is for . With care , you can figure out where the thread starts without a dial . <p> As far as getting 380 - 480 out of the 220 line the same transformer set up in an autotransformer configuration will work just fine . <p> Either stack the 120 secondary on the 240 primary and get 360 VAC or stack the 240 secondary on the 240 primary and get 480 . Either way the transformer only has to carry 1/3 to 1/2 the total KVA load . <p> Relating to finding used VFD 's and motors around here getting to know the guys in the savage yards will save you loads of money ! In many places they will give you the electronics for the scrap price of the aluminum heatsinks just to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77965 @qwx697965 <p> Ok , So for the time being I 'm 100% sold on the idea of using DC . I trust you guys and your first hand experience , but I 've been digesting your comments for the past half day and I 'm wondering ( theoretically ) why the universal motor with triac control at low speed is a no-go . ... 77968 @qwx697968 <p> It 's worse than that , the universal motor even on DC is still terrible for low RPM torque and stability . Because it is series wound the torque at low RPM is terrible , so your closed loop system pumps in tons of power trying to make the torque at low RPM and it will be nasty and unstable . <p> You need a DC motor , like a perm magnet motor and treadmill motors are some of the best for lathes as they are lower RPM than other applications . <p> Also for a lathe you need huge torques , I have a small lathe and it 's way too easy to stall the chuck when working steel , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sized treadmill motor Strantor , or pay the $$ for a good VFD motor and drive .

A transformer ? <p> Using a 5A diode to pass 5A is very marginal and will likely have poor reliability .

Let me introduce you to Digi-Key 's parametric search facility , which allows you to find parts based on several choices ( parameters ) . ( Other vendors have similar search capabilities , but I find that most of them do n't seem to work as well as Digi-Key 's . ) <p> Here is the starting point if you 're looking for rectifier diodes . On this page , try this : Under " Diode Type " , select " Standard " . Under " Mounting Type " , select " Through hole " . Last , check the " In stock " checkbox ( no point searching for stuff they do n't have in stock ) . <p> Click " Apply Filters " . The next window shows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search by selecting other parameters , like the current rating . Under " Current - Average Rectified ( Io ) " , try selecting 10A . Click " Apply Filters " again . Now you have a much smaller list which you can look through to find a suitable diode . <p> Rectifier circuits are rather unusual circuits even though they seem so simple . The reason is because of the behavior of the diodes under stress with various kinds of post filtering is rather complex . We are dealing with very low impedance devices so there are problems that can come up . <p> Take a 1 amp diode and pump an already rectified sine wave though it and you get some normal power heating . Double the current but halve the time ( half wave rectification ) and in basic power heating theory you get to use that diode for twice its rated current . Looking closer however , the diode voltage goes up somewhat and so it causes more power heating than the basic theory would predict . This means we 'd have to derate the diode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half wave ) which brings us to 1.6 amps in this half wave sine wave application , but this is with an actual half wave sine , or a diode in a full wave bridge with resistive load only . <p> Problems set in however when we add capacitive filtering . Suddenly the diode current is not sine anymore , sometimes no where near sine , but more like a short pulse of current . With only a small amount of capacitor ESR , we could end up with as much as three times the power heating in that diode even in bridge configuration . That 's pretty amazing if you ask me , but there is a saving grace built in to most low voltage rectifier circuits : the transformer . The transformer has primary and secondary resistance and even some inductance , which lowers the peak current through the diode and so saves the diode in the end from overheating . <p> The exact current peak is very hard to calculate without knowing a lot about the transformer , but many transformers have significant equivalent resistance and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least in most low voltage low power circuits . In higher power circuits however , we have to be very careful because often the minor resistances are not as large as with the lower power circuits because we do n't  want excessive inefficiencies to eat up too much of the available input power . We do want to be able to use the diodes to full capacity though , and in rectifier circuits we can sometimes use the diode at a higher than rated current . It depends mostly on the external circuit impedances . <p> So what 's the best medicine here then with all these variables ? It appears that the best is to take a couple measurements and see just what your diodes are doing . Often in a bridge you only have to measure one diode to see what the others are doing too . A measurement of current and voltage on the scope is a good idea , followed by some simple calculations to calculate the power heating . Based on the package size you should be able to determine if you 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if many of our low voltage circuits that we use every day did not have lossy transformers in them ( wall warts ) we would probably be burning up diodes on a regular basis <p> Last edited : Oct 4 , 2011 77974 @qwx697974 <p> It 's all about how much heating the diode gets and its ability to dissipate the heat . There is a peak current high enough that will blow bonding wires or die connection . <p> The silicon diode will have a voltage drop depending on current , useable range is usually in 0.6 ( low current ) to 1.0v ( high current ) . The voltage drop will be lower for a given current as the diode die is bigger and if mounted to a sufficient heat sink . <p> It can take a large short period current spike since the heating is small over a time average compared to continuous current and its associating heating .

Small error is caused by the air compressing and small column of diesel filling the tube .

Important thing is to keep the diesel out of the sensor and the tube does just that . - Diesel fumes in the tube do not affect the pressure reading , but they may damage some sensors . - Material selection ( for the tube ) and careful sealing of the connections is of course required . Steel tube should work very well . <p> I do n't see how submerging electronic sensor + wiring in diesel is a good idea . If you think diesel fumes might be a problem , what about liquid diesel ?

The nominal amount of gain that the adjustment may provide is not going to make much difference in your range . Say your range is 300 meters without adjustment .

" In fact I am surprised they did work as well as you say . The original antenna was of a particular length for a good reason . And even that length was a compromise selected after many trials carried out by the vehicle manufacturer . All vehicle antennas for use on the broadcast bands , whether for medium frequencies or v.h.f. , are a compromise because they are very short in comparison to the wavelengths they are intended to receive ( or sometimes transmit ) and they all have some method of compensation for this . Replacing one with another of radically different length , especially a much shorter one , is a major step in the wrong direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is/was and put up with its looks . If you want something pretty you will , in all probability , have to put up with poor reception . <p> It is often said that any radio system is no better than its antenna/s . <p> Eh Kurnia , My father-in-law is an avid Honda fan , that said he owns a heap of classic Honda 's but his nu girlfriend suggested he buy one of those Jazz 's as they are a honda in which he did . He said the same thing and had a similar problem so he got a mate to replace the radio with a previous Honda radio that worked better . Now he 's happier than Larry would ever be . <p> Just a thought Bryan <p> " NEVER argue with stupid people , they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience " - Mark Twain <p> If you make the aerial longer , it wo n't tune properly , and you have to add tuning coils etc. to bring it back in tune , a popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses a bottom tuning coil to make it work . <p> If you 're talking a dipole aerial , then it 's half a wavelength long overall , each side is quarter wavelength - a quarterwave whip is actually the ' same ' as a dipole , the other half is reflected in the ground plane of the car body . <p> As you 're wanting to cover a fairly wide bandwidth ( 20MHz ) , then the aerial will be a comprimise anyway - the shorter aerial are generally helical ones , with the aerial rod spiralled round . <p> Usually , car antennas are n't that terribly caring about antenna length as long as it grabs enough signal . They use short ones , collapsable ones , dipoles that are part of the windshield ( windscreen ) , etc .

That 's it . It 's just as high as the windshield . <p> There must be something else here . Might that be that antenna length is not really the only ultimate factor to consider when designing an antenna ? Are there something else ? Is spiralled wire ( Nigel had mentioned ) one important thing ? <p> Bryan , Was it about the antenna not receiving properly or the radio unit was n't really receiving signals ?

Moving the aerial outside the car will increase range considerably . <p> Is there any way I can extend the aerial from the main unit , I just had a thought about using the car aerial . <p> I was thinking of putting a relay in line , so that when the car is on ACC , the relay clicks over and gives the signal from the aerial to the radio , otherwise , the aerial picks up the RF transmissions and works a whole lot better .. <p> These things have precisely tuned antenna 's , usually etched on a PCB .

The risk you take is in interfering with something or someone else then they take steps to track you down . <p> An example - I am an amateur radio operator so I do what I do with RF for fun and to learn .

More often than not the source is found and usually the approach is to point out the interference problem - that works most of the time . When it does n't we enlist the aid of the FCC or other agencies . Most of the time the offending signals result from commercial transmitters or equipment but now and then it 's deliberate and unauthorized transmission . <p> I 'd agree that the momentary push of a button is n't likely to get a lot of attention unless that momentary push was near the same location where it bothered something - and someone makes the connection to your activities . <p> well seeing that the chances of being caught with an illegal RF device is pretty slim , there were reasons why it was illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fail because RF interference is being made an illegal device , somebody could die or something .

Now it runs on a 12v battery , if available , would a 14volt battery be better ? <p> The company is also replacing the batteries for free which is a good call seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thanks for the link , basically had the same ideas as I did . I know the freqency of my alarm , is very close to the 433Mhz mark like most of them on the market are . I like the idea of the external aerial , with amplifier .. <p> At this stage I 'm not toooo worried about the FCC coming to get me , I just want an extremely effective car alarm . I found out the transmitter runs on 12v , so I ca n't really increase the power to that .. unless somehow I can get a bigger battery in there and I might have to change components around . 
@@71811959 @511959/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> LM358 Output saturation at 3.707V . <p> I am working on a temperature controller based on LM35 ( Temperature sensor ) and interfaced to PIC microcontroller ADC , with 5V as reference for ADC . <p> To increase the resolution of my signal from LM35 , I have added an amplifier -- LM358 , with a gain of 11 and supply of +5V and 0V . <p> My problem is that the output of LM358 ( op-amp ) saturates at 3.707V . I know that LM358 is not a rail-to-rail Op-amp , but I never expected the output to saturate at 3.707V ( when supply is +5V and 0V ) . I decided to reduce the gain of amplifier so that the output never reaches 3.707V for my application need . <p> My query -- <p> Where do I get this figure 0f 3.707V output saturation in the data sheet of LM358 ( that will help me to figure out such error during design of any other project ) ? <p> There is a parameter called " Output Voltage Swing " It has two items in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is always lower than the supply voltage and Vol which is a couple of tens of millivolts . <p> Note also the " Common Mode Input Range " It is usually specified as V+ minus 1.5 to 2 Volts .

Feeding the LM358 with 6.4 volts intead of 5v will get you to that magic 5 volts output ( well 5.1 volts ) . <p> The chances are , you 're running the regulator from a &gt;9V so it wo n't be a problem . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Hence why I suggested running from a seperate 7805 with a couple of diodes in the gnd leg . <p> This would bump up the 5v output to approx 6.4 volts but more importantly should give the opamp a swing from around 300mv ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ) to around 5.1 volts which is within the spec of the PIC input . <p> I 've done a fair bit of research on the LM358 as I have around 4000 of them sitting on reels in the workshop

But I still ca n't comfortably wrap my head around the entire thing , including counter-EMF , expanding and collapsing fields and all that . <p> So I 'm soliciting explanations from y'all , either your own finely-crafted short essays , or pointers to existing pages out there in Web-land . <p> I 'd like to be able to understand the very basics of how coils work , starting with the right-hand rule and all that . Good illustrations would help , so I can finally grasp the relationships between the direction of current and the direction of the magnetic fields generated ( and vice versa ) . <p> I have one request : Please do not try to explain it in terms like " the inductor tries to keep its current constant ... " I hate that ! Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it tries to anthropomorphize ( big fancy word for " make it seem like it 's human " ) a physical process , which has nothing to do with anything " wanting " to do anything . Please just explain it in terms of fields , forces , etc . See how good a teacher you can be ! <p> I know it 's basically a simple concept , but sometimes it 's the simplest things that make our heads hurt the most ... <p> To get the ball rolling , check this page on inductance from one of my favored site for explaining technical stuff , HowStuffWorks . ( I just now found this page . ) In it , they say <p> Think About Water ... <p> One way to visualize the action of an inductor is to imagine a narrow channel with water flowing through it , and a heavy water wheel that has its paddles dipping into the channel . Imagine that the water in the channel is not flowing initially . <p> Now you try to start the water flowing . The paddle wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come up to speed with the water . If you then try to stop the flow of water in the channel , the spinning water wheel will try to keep the water moving until its speed of rotation slows back down to the speed of the water . An inductor is doing the same thing with the flow of electrons in a wire -- an inductor resists a change in the flow of electrons. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> which actually helps . <p> So basically what they 're explaining is that an inductor has inertia , electrically speaking ( a resistance to change in imposed current ) . And to be more precise , when they say " an inductor resists a change in the flow of electrons " , one should add " due to the creation of an opposing magnetic field " . Correct ? <p> Anyhow , I could really use some illustrations to help me grasp this simple concept . <p> Let 's start with the energy characteristics of the magnetic field . The magnetic field stores energy equal to 1/2 LI- . Thus the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The energy is added or subtracted from the magnetic field by a voltage appearing across the inductor which changes the current where V = L di/dt . If the inductor voltage is in the same direction as current flow , then energy is added to the field . If the voltage is in the opposite direction to the current flow , energy is subtracted from the field The magnetic energy does not change when the current is constant , thus there is no voltage drop across an inductor for that condition ( neglecting inductor resistance ) . Because of the voltage caused by the energy change due to an increase or decrease in the current , the inductor appears to resist the change in current , thus acting similar to an inertial mass in the physical world where it takes energy to increase or decrease it 's speed , and the mass thus has a resistance ( inertia ) to this change . <p> It seems we all have our favorite &amp; despised analogies . I do n't particularly like the water one , but if it helps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowing through a wire cause a magnetic field ( see RightHand rule ) that surrounds the wire . Coiling the wire causes this field to reinforce itself , setting up its ' " inductive characteristic " .

The higher the gauss , the greater the inductive effect . Inductance ( in Henrys ) is the metric of a physical build : wire gauge , wire material , # turns , core diameter , core material , layout ( toroidal/bar , etc ) , winding type ( spiral/crosshatch , etc ) , ( probably left some factors out ) . <p> Just my verbiage on a topic difficult to visualize , hope it ( and those from others ) helps ... &lt;&lt;&lt; ) ) ) <p> Crutschows ' description is an Excellent Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inductance needed I need a simple , yet comprehensive explanation of how basic inductance works . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> You are asking for two different things . First the explanation . As any physics book will tell you , inductance is the flux linkage per unit current of a circuit loop . In other words , it is the amount of linkage of magnetic flux between one circuit and another ( mutual-inductance ) , or within the same circuit ( self-inductance ) . So inductance does not " work " . It is a quantity of magnetic flux transference . Magnetic flux works by storing and releasing energy . Remember , energy has an equivalency to work . All those other things you have read explain the ins and outs of how magnetic flux does what it does . No one can do much better than that . <p> It seems we all have our favorite &amp; despised analogies . I do n't particularly like the water one , but if it helps the visualization ... all good . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> I 'm going to drift from carbonzit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends for their mechanical abilities . They rely on me for electronic knowledge . They quickly visualise electronic components if I can explain them in mechanical terms . <p> An inductor is analogous to a flywheel A capacitor is analogous to a spring <p> They then quickly consider the many ways in which these two types of devices can be varied or interconnected . <p> The rate at which that change takes place is Newton 's third law : For every action their is an equal and opposite reaction . <p> --- <p> If one wishes to think of it in terms of say calculus ; Then the instantaneous voltage ( thus resistance/impedance ) is a function of the differential of the waveform with respect to the inductor 's value . V = L di/dt <p> I do believe the easiest way to understand it is to put it into a context which the person learning can understand . The irresistible force vs the immovable object and the compromise that is the outcome . <p> If you are looking for very basic rules then you might start with a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . That conductor has inductance just like a larger ' inductor ' and behaves just the same . <p> Note that it does n't  actually do anything by itself , just sitting there for a time . We have to connect a power source to it to get anything to happen , and that 's when things start to change dramatically . Connecting a battery to the inductor through some short leads causes a voltage to appear across the wire , and as the voltage appears a current also begins to appear through the wire . Along with that a magnetic field appears surrounding the wire with a certain orientation . The voltage forces current through the wire , but the current cant change instantaneously because the field is changing and that induces an emf that is opposite to that of the battery , and thus acts like a small battery that is in anti series with the external battery we connected . That action is what we commonly call inductance , well at least that 's half the story . <p> The other half is when we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly replace the battery with a resistance then the field starts to collapse , and that generates a current through the wire with a voltage across the ends . Since the field is decreasing now the polarity of the voltage is opposite to what the battery was , but the current is in the same direction . An interesting observation is that at a very very short time after the battery is removed , even though there is a resistor there now the current appears to stay at the same level for that short time . What actually happens though is that the current starts to decrease , but that decrease over shorter time intervals is very small so we say that the inductor keeps the current constant . Obviously if it is decreasing it ca n't be constant , but for those very short times we say that it stays constant because after all it 's hard to measure the difference between 1.000001 amps and 1.000000 amps . With greater time comes greater change , and the current decreases to zero . If there could be some way to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current would stay the same indefinitely . If we had 1 amp flowing at time t=0 then we would have that same current flowing an hour later , but with real life circuits this usually is n't possible nor desirable in say power converters . <p> So the main reason why we have inductance is because of the building up or collapsing of the magnetic field . It 's the changing magnetic field that causes the inductance . And since when the field is increasing it in turn generates a counter voltage , we do n't  get a short circuit but rather what we commonly call an ' inductor ' . <p> We can take a macro view of the inductor for a very short time period by examining the voltage and current in a circuit with an inductor in series with a resistor and battery . With a current level of say 1 amp and the inductor still charging , we do n't  see the entire battery voltage across the resistor . What we see is some of the voltage across the inductor . That means that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than if the inductor was a short circuit . If we let time progress however , that inductance would charge up and start to look like a short circuit so all of the voltage would appear across the resistor . Connecting the battery up to the resistor and inductor , first all of the voltage would appear across the inductor ( inductance totally opposes all of the voltage ) and then as the field becomes steady the current would start to flow and voltage would start to appear across the resistor . Eventually all the voltage appears across the resistor . <p> Last edited : Jul 31 , 2011 77974 @qwx697974 <p> if you understand how a capacitor works , then its bit similar how an inductor works . capacitors are charged by increasing the terminal voltage , but inductors are charged by increasing current passing through . try to understand comparing both .. you will find it easy .. <p> OK , I 'm going to try to focus like a laser beam on the one aspect of inductance that I really want to understand .

I think most people simply accept this as a given . Not me ; I really need to know at least something about why this happens . I 'm referring to the basic physics of electromagnetism and induced current . <p> Here 's how I see it , illustrated . This seems correct to me . However , if it is not , I would very much appreciate being shown the error(s) in my explanation . <p> So we all know that when a current flows through a conductor , a magnetic field is produced , shown here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The direction of current is that of " conventional " current flow . For fans of " electron flow " , just reverse it . The magnetic lines of force , however , rotate in the direction shown . ) <p> OK , so what we have is a static magnetic field , for some constant flow of current through the conductor . <p> Now let 's change the current ( by changing the voltage ) . When we increase the current flow , the magnetic field expands ( looking at the conductor end-on ) : <p> ( and vice versa : when the current decreases , the magnetic field shrinks ) <p> So here 's what I think happens to cause the opposition to the change in current . As the magnetic field around a conductor expands , its lines of force cut across adjacent conductors : <p> This causes a current to be induced in the adjacent conductor , just as if the conductor were moved through a magnetic field , as in a generator ; instead , here the conductor 's position is fixed and the magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its expansion . <p> So that 's why we get " reverse EMF " from changing currents . Now , my explanation is missing a few details , which would explain why the induced current as shown above is in opposition to the current already flowing through the conductor . It must have something to do with the direction of current relative to the direction of the moving magnetic lines of force . <p> Can somebody complete this explanation ? ( or correct it if needed ? ) <p> ( Wacky side thought : if the action were the opposite--if any change in current was aided by , rather than opposed by , the inductor , would we have some kind of free energy generator ? Because the more you increase the current , the more the current would increase , ad infinitum , which of course is impossible ... ) <p> OK , I 'm going to try to focus like a laser beam on the one aspect of inductance that I really want to understand . I think it 's clearer to me now , since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I think you should look at how both coils and capacitors work from an energy point of view . You are wondering why the current does not build and decay in a coil as fast as it would in a resistor only circuit , right ? Let 's start with the basics . Voltage is the energy density of the charge ( joules/coulomb ) , OK ? The more voltage , the higher the energy density , and the more energy is available to send charge flowing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Current exists , but does not flow . " Current flow " is a redundancy , like " velocity flow " . Now let 's apply a voltage to a circuit containing only a coil and see what happens . At the very instant the voltage is applied , the current is limited by the resistance all practical coils have . Otherwise , the current pulse would be infinite . Now you wonder why the current does not build up as fast as it would if only the resistor were present ? The reason is that energy is diverted to build the magnetic field around the coil . With less energy available , the energy density of the charge ( voltage ) becomes less . Therefore less current will exist through the coil . Now you can think of the less voltage available to be the result of a " back-voltage " opposing the forward voltage if you want , but does n't it make more sense to think of the lower forward voltage a result of an energy drain ? The opposite happens when the driving voltage is lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This keeps up the energy density of the charge ( voltage ) for a period of time causing the current to exist at a higher value than it would with only a resistor present . So by considering coils and capacitors as energy storage elements , much of the wonderment of how they work is eliminated . Think energy ! <p> While the explanations in your last post appear to be true , taken as a whole , 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Phew ! I was hoping I was n't too far off base there . <p> they appear to be convoluted and unnecessarily complicated . I think you should look at how both coils and capacitors work from an energy point of view . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> With all due respect , I feel that describes your explanation . I 'm not saying it 's wrong , just unnecessarily abstract . <p> I tried to describe the physical mechanism that inhibits the change of current in an inductor . This physical process , assuming I 've described it correctly , is the underlying cause of everything you described ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different process with capacitance ) . <p> Of course , it is useful to look at inductance from an energy point of view ; I 'm focusing on a specific aspect of how these things work , to try to wrap my head around it . <p> You do n't  need to consider the expansion of the field to understand these basics though , so you can reduce that complication too . Instead , you only need to consider the increase or decrease of the intensity of the field . If you apply a voltage across a horizontal wire with plus on the right , you first get a field that is increasing , and that increasing field induces a voltage in the wire just like the battery , only in reverse . So it 's like having two batteries in series but the inductive one is in reverse to the real battery . Because the voltages are the same , no current flows ( yet ) . The field later starts to increase less quickly , so the opposing voltage decreases and so the battery starts to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field no longer increases and the reverse voltage falls to zero so the battery supplies more current . Something else has happened too though , and that is that the field intensity has built up to some max value held by the current flow , and if we remove the battery and replace it with a resistor the current now decreases a little ( before it was always increasing ) . That decreasing field causes the voltage to reverse across the wire and that keeps the current flowing for a while . After a time the field falls to zero , and the voltage falls to zero , and no more current . <p> So to sum up , the changing field regulates the current through the inductor ( wire ) . Once the field becomes static it only stores energy . <p> To look at it in a sort of pseudo sequential fashion , we would have : Forward voltage creates field , opposing field only allows some current to flow , when field reaches max the most current can flow . Removed battery means removed forward voltage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field reaches zero current reaches zero . <p> Make sense ? 77974 @qwx697974 <p> If you apply a voltage across a horizontal wire with plus on the right , you first get a field that is increasing , and that increasing field induces a voltage in the wire just like the battery , only in reverse . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> But what you ( and everyone else ) seem to gloss over , perhaps because it seems trivial to you , is why the field induces a reverse voltage . Which is what I tried to explain : just that mechanism . So do you agree with my explanation , above ? None of the texts I 've found , either in my house or on the web , seem to explain that part of it . <p> The electrons interact with the field in a manner similar to a metal ball and a magnet . The magnetic field pushes or pulls the free electrons so they form a current which induces a voltage in the wire . You can get a very rough picture of this ( and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metal ball on a flat table and moving a magnet near it sweeping from say left to right . Electrons exhibit electrostatic properties but also magnetic properties . <p> Another way of thinking of it is to imagine a field already formed , a static field , and an electron shot through that field . There is a force on the electron as it passed into the field which makes it turn because it interacts with the field . There 's various ways to look at this more exactly , but the basic idea is that a magnetic field produces a force on an electron and so the electron , if it is free to move , actually does move , and we know that movement forms a current in the wire . <p> You 're explanation , if i understand you right , should not really talk about the field expanding , but rather the field increasing or decreasing at any given point . In this kind of classical discussion we would assume that the field goes out to infinity even when there is little intensity near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings in other properties that we do n't  need to worry about for this discussion ( ie wave propagation ) . <p> If you want to look at the field intensities at various points in space away from the ' wire ' , you can use Biot Savart . That makes it a little easier to visualize the field . <p> Last edited : Aug 1 , 2011 77974 @qwx697974 <p> But to illustrate a reply , i would like to describe a physical active situation . <p> ******** <p> You are pushing a cart along with your hands , along fairly even ground . You can feel the pressure on your palms as you push it along . Then it comes time to stop , so you slow down to stop . You feel the cart pulls on your hands a bit , then you stop . <p> Very simple , what 's to know here you ask . Well , the cart always went forwards , but the pressure on your hands went from pushing to pulling . <p> I hope this illustrates to you why the induced current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier that you are not keen on these illustrative kinds of explanation , but this one is fairly simple . And its hard to explain in other more technical ways . <p> Well you know the simplest way to explain it is probably with Faraday . E=-d(Phi)/dt where Phi is the flux . Otherwise we have to figure out how the field which is perpendicular to the flow of electrons can impede and quicken the flow by simply increasing and decreasing . The field would have a rotation effect on the electrons either toward the center of the wire or toward the surface . The expansion of the field would be outward away from the wire and not parallel to the wire , and would take place very quickly . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> I think you are correct . The expanding shape of the lines of force around the conductors is responsible for the back EMF . <p> ******** <p> As to your next paragraph about missing a few details .....

Just good old pencil and paper ( ball-point pen , actually ) , digitized by a scanner . <p> Y'know , people still use that ancient stuff to make drawings ... <p> Regarding your cart analogy , I actually like those kinds of illustrations ( like the water-wheel one I posted , it describes the " inertia " that inductance imposes on current flow ) . I just do n't like explanations that impute some kind of conscious action to the coil : " The inductor wants to keep current flowing through it after the voltage is removed " . <p> The expanding shape of the lines of force around the conductors is responsible for the back EMF. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> This is not exactly correct , the back EMF is due to the rate of increasing magnetic flux density surrounding the inductor conductor <p> When the magnetic field reaches it maximum density , the inductor conductor appears purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched off , the magnetic field surrounding the inductor collapses and induces a current back into the inductor . When the magnetic flux change becomes zero , the current stops flowing in the inductor . <p> If you wind a coil on a ferrite core , the increase in ' inductance ' is because of the ability of the coil and ferrite core to create a higher magnetic flux density around the inductor . If the magnetic field density is increased to a point were the ferrite can not support the increasing magnetic field flux , it will ' saturate ' and again the inductor will become purely resistive . <p> So its the rate of change of magnetic flux around the conductor that creates the back EMF . <p> Last edited : Aug 2 , 2011 77969 @qwx697969 
@@71811961 @511961/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> No , you just need to consult the manufacturers ratings . Essentially there are two problems , one is the current handling capacity of the switch - too much current through the contacts will make them overheat , leading to failure of the switch . Secondly is the breaking capacity of the switch , as the contacts open current will arc across the gap , burning the contacts - too much current and the arc wo n't stop - this is why switches generally have a much higher AC rating than DC . <p> This is n't intended as a wise-crack . As a rule ( the rule-of-thumb ) the switch manufacturer will specify the voltage and current ratings . You need to stay within all of the manufacturer 's parameters in order to expect the performance they claim . <p> Think about some of the issues related to current . One might first think of the contact surfaces but you also need to consider everything including the connection points into and out of the switch . Current flow results in heating and one limiting factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tolerate . Manufacturers are likely to use different designs and materials for switches that are similarly . That suggests that it 's unlikely you can predict what the average switch will do under overload conditions . <p> Voltage is something that affects the arc that results when the switch is opened under load . It also affects things like materials selection in terms of insulating properties . Separation between conductors is also a voltage issue . It 's an oversimplification but the variations among manufacturers would make it difficult to extrapolate outside of manufacturer 's limits . <p> Thanks for the replies . Sorry , I do n't think I made myself clear being a numpty with the electrickery most of the time . <p> If I know the AC rating , is there any way to decide the DC capacity if the manufacturer does n't state it ? Most switches seem to state only the AC rating . <p> For example , I have a miniature toggle switch in front of me right now with " 3A 125VAC , 1A 250VAC " on it and another full-size one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specs do not give any info about DC . <p> Trevor - if I were in your position and the intended use was a non-critical application - I might use a switch rated for 1 amp AC on a 12 or 24 VDC application of an amp or two but only if the consequences of failure were no worse than an inconvenience . Many of us try to be careful with responses because we do n't know the application and quite often people who ask for help are looking for what might be considered good , safe , professional practice . <p> Thanks for the replies .

The specs do not give any info about DC . <p> How does one decide if a switch is ok for any given DC application ? <p> Sorry again for not being clear . <p> Trevor 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Normally a switch 's contact current rating will be much lower for DC then AC current . This is because the AC voltage passes through ' zero ' voltage 60 or 50 times a second and helps ' break ' the spark gap as the switch contacts open . This does n't happen in DC so the contacts are subjected to much more heat as the contacts open a DC circuit . This heat can really damage switch contacts quickly . I 've seen many relays with their switch contacts welded closed due to having higher current switched then they were rated for . <p> If you look at switch ratings in on-line catologs you will see the difference in AC and DC contact current ratings for switches that do have their AC and DC current specs published , let that be a guide for you to ' derate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a DC current spec . <p> I would suggest you derate by a factor of five or so ! - if the manufacturer is n't even giving a DC value , it 's not a good sign ! . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> If you ca n't reach a derating factor of five , an alternative may be to derate ( by a smaller factor ) both current and voltage specs . <p> Also , the load that you are switching affects the " nominal DC current " of the switch : it is easier to turn off a resistive load ( ie lamps ) than an inductive one . <p> Also choose a switch that opens quickly : DC ( and high voltage ) switches , when you move the lever ( toggle or whatever you move to open it ) accumulate energy in a spring and then suddently open . The contact opening speed is independent of the speed at which you move the lever . <p> " AC only " switches may open slowly , as the zero crossing tends to open the arc . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distributors of our cars ? A good way to " divert " the arc from the contacts , was to use a capacitor ( also called condenser ) in parallel with the contacts .

With a little experimentation , one can have a fair amount of success by just connecting a series combination of a small capacitor ( say 0,1mfd ) and a resistor ( say 47R or 100R ) across the switch contact .

@@71811963 @511963/ 77978 @qwx697978 <h> Project : DC Motor Control ( using a single switch ) <p> As a Hobby , I have devised this module and named it as DC Motor control using IC 7555 . This simple circuit fabricated by me makes a DC motor to run in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction and stop it using a single switch . It provides a constant voltage for proper operation of the motor . LED 1 indicates that the motor is in stop condition . LED 2 indicates that the motor is rotating in Forward direction and LED 3 indicates that the motor is running in reverse direction . <p> Regarding the connection , I have wired the Timer IC1 as a monostable multivibrator to avoid false triggering of the motor , while pressing the switch S1 . Its time period is approximately 500 milliseconds ( ms ) . <p> Initially , the circuit is in reset condition with Q0 output of IC2 being high . Since Q1 and Q3 outputs of IC2 are low , the outputs of IC3 and IC4 are high and the motor does n't rotate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition . <p> As I press the switch S1 , the timer 555 ( IC1 ) provides a pulse to decade counter CD4017 ( IC2 ) , which advances its output by one and its high state shifts from Q0 to Q1 . When Q1 goes high , the output of IC3 at pin 3 goes low , so the motor starts running in clockwise ( forward ) direction . The forward rotation of the motor is indicated by Led 2 . <p> Now when I press S1 again , the high output of IC2 shifts from Q1 to Q2 . The low Q1 output of IC2 makes pin 3 of IC3 high and the motor does n't rotate . LED1glows ( via diode D2 ) to indicate that the motor is in stop condition . <p> When the switch S1 is pressed once again , the high output of IC2 shifts from Q2 to Q3 . The high Q3 output of IC2 makes pin 3 of IC4 low and the motor starts running in anti-clockwise ( reverse ) direction . LED3 glows to indicate that the motor is running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is pressed again , the high output of IC2 shifts from Q3 to Q4 . Since Q4 is connected to reset pin 15 , it resets decade counter CD4017 and its Q0 output goes high , so the motor does not rotate . LED1 glows via diode D1 to indicate that the motor is in stop condition . Thereafter , the cycle repeats . <p> For not allowing the motor to run in reverse direction , I removed the timer IC4 along with resistors R5 and R7 and LED3 and connect b ' terminal of the motor to +Vcc . Similarly if I do not want to operate the motor to run in forward direction , I removed timer IC3 along with resistors R4 and R6 and LED2 and connect a ' terminal of the motor to +Vcc . I have utilized a 9V regulated power supply for a 9V DC motor . <p> It looks workable , why not try it ? I do n't have a small enough motor that could run from the outputs of a 555 to try it myself . Also , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its a clever idea . Klaus <p> No ICs needed I would use a triple pole , triple throw , toggle switch and cross wire the switch to reverse polarity and just add the LEDs with resistors to indicate forward or reverse direction . <p> Use the center poles to attach the battery . wire the left two poles one positive and one negative and wire to the right two poles , but reverse the wiring . It would then form an x so it is cross wired . hook the small motor to either set of outer poles . When you have the switch in the center position no current flows but if you throw the switch one way you will get the motor to turn in one direction . If you throw the switch to the opposite side you will then reverse the polarity and the motor will turn in the opposite direction .

This will allow the transistor to work at a gain that it should have even with a change in temperature .

The example below shows a CD player , output impedance shown by Rout , and an amplifier , input impedance shown by Rin . <p> If Rin = Rout , then the potential divider will attenuate the signal by half , which is n't what you want ! - if Rin &gt; 5 x Rout , then attenuation is small enough to be ignored . So it 's common to have the input impedance at least five times the output impedance that feeds it . <p> You should be aware that this is for best ' VOLTAGE TRANSFER ' , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for best ' POWER TRANSFER ' the two values should be equal - you can easily confirm this with ohms law and power calculations . <p> Let me explain the concept in easy words , suppose you have a wall socket that provides you with 230V mains . Now suppose you connect a low resistance ( for example a conductor like a copper wire ) across the line and neutral . What should happen ? Tremendous current will flow through the wire and blow off your fuse . This happened because the impedance of your ckt ( i.e copper wire ) was very low and hence you pulled a lot of current which blew off the lest sensitive part of your ckt ( i.e. fuse ) . Now suppose you connect a high resistance ckt into your mains . since the resistance is high it will pull very little current from the mains and not load the mains ( hence your fuse will not blow off ) . In this fashion you will always want that whatever load or ckt you have should have high input impedence so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage or signal . ) . <p> This is a very simplified amplifier ( no biasing , coupling , etc ) . It is also a model : In real life , R1 and R2 would not be actual resistors . <p> R1 represents input impedance . If its too low , current will flow straight to ground , instead of going through the BE junction of Q1 . If its extremely high , very little current will flow through R1 , but more current will flow through the BE junction of Q1 . <p> R2 represents output impedance . Obviously it should be low or not much current will get to the load . <p> So , an ideal amplifier has infinite input impedance and zero output impedance . Remember too that input and output impedance are not simply resistances , since the definition of impedance is resistance to an alternating current .

You use either use something that needs their speed ( and low torque ) like a fan/propeller or use gears to decrease their speed ( and increase torque ) like wheels . If you just slow them down directly it will take away most of the motor 's power ( which comes in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too low already it wo n't be able to do anything useful . <p> You can use resistors if they are large enough to handle the power . It also wastes a lot of energy since it 's just being turned to heat by the resistor . Assuming it does do whatever you want it to do at 60RPM ( which it probably does n't ) - to slow it down your way from 10kRPM , about 0.25% of the power drawn from the battery would get to the motor , the other 99.75% would be getting turned to heat . THat 's a really terrible way to do anything . <p> Reduce the voltage or use gears . Using gears which will decrease speed , increase torque on for the same voltage which means the current draw will be reduced and that means the energy not required by the motor stays in the battery , where it belongs . Reduce the voltage by using a lower voltage battery or a PWM-based motor controller . These do not burn off the excess energy as heat , but control the voltage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power from the battery not needed by the motor stays in the battery . <p> What is this motor for ? Because if it 's for moving anything , I can tell you right now that it probably wo n't without gears unless the wheel is less than 1mm-2mm in diameter ( which really means the motor shaft is acting directly as the wheel ) . And with that radius at 60RPM it 's going to be travelling at a top speed of 1-2mm per second . You can always use gears to get the torque up to what you need and use a PWM controller to get it down the rest of the way . <p> Motors produce mechanical power ... They convert electrical power into mechanical power .... If you use a resistor to decrease the current to the motor , you are decreasing the available power ... both electrical and mechanical . <p> Power is the quantity that is transferred from the motor to the wheels ... power is the mathematical product of torque and rotational velocity . <p> Use a gear train , or a pulley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor operating speed to a lower shaft speed at the wheels . <p> If you have access to a lathe , you should be able to fashion some pulleys out of plastic , nylon , or some other convenient material .

Almost anything will work with a system that does n't  require a large amount of mechanical power , but as the load gets bigger the motor has to supply enough torque to get the load going . DC motors seem to have the most torque at zero speed , so it might work for your app if it does n't  require too much power . 77974 @qwx697974 <p> Looks like the output protection diode is missing from that circuit diagram .

Also the entire thing can be sealed in a plastic cover and stored --especially AWAY FROM CHILDREN AND SERVANT MAIDS- AS THEY WOULD NOT KNOW THE CONTENT AND ITS SERIOUSNESS . <p> You can dispose of used ferric chloride by mixing it with sodium carbonate ( or bicarbonate ) and you will get a sludge of copper carbonate powder and a solution of sodium chloride ( salt ) . You can pour the solution down the drain and throw the sludge in the garbage . <p> Personally , since finding Ammonium Persulphate I would never use Ferric Chloride again . AP is so much cleaner . <p> Note that the commercial etchants such as the link by Pommie and this one LONG ... have ferric chloride at a concentration of about 40% by weight . That means , 40 g of ferric chloride ( anhydrous ) in 100 g of solution . That is considerably more concentrated than a couple of teaspoons ( assuming a density of 4 , that would be about 40 g ) in 250 mL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilute solution will work . I am just pointing out that it is considerably less concentrated than commercial etchant and may work more slowly . <p> As it turns out , the commercial etchant is just a little more dilute than a saturated solution . If you buy ferric chloride as the hydrate ( hexa ) , it will probably come in big chunks or very coarse amorphous granules . You can just add the calculated amount of water ( an amount of water equal to 0.5 times the weight of ferric chloride hexahydrate will give 40% w/w ) and let it sit for a few days . Gentle warming helps . Concentrated solutions are stable for a very long time . <p> For use , one can use the solution as is or add a little water , if you want something a little less viscous . Some sources suggest adding a little table salt ( NaCl ) too , which is supposed to increase the etching speed . <p> The difference in this procedure is starting with the hydrated salt instead of the anhydrous salt . The hydrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not produce the heat that the anhydrous salt does upon addition of water . <p> In many areas , disposal of small amounts of etchant down the drain is allowed . The hazard is not so much from the ferric chloride , but from the dissolved copper ( mostly cupric ) . Adding carbonate ( as suggested ) alkalinizes the solution and causes both iron and copper salts to precipitate . Sodium hydroxide ( lye ) could also be used as the hydroxides of both metals are insoluble .

AP is so much cleaner . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> Pommie , it is much cleaner at the first glance . You forgot to mention that you only have satisfying results if you heat it to 55deg/C . Getting to 56deg/C you have a big problem if you leave your etchant cuvette filled with the stuff . It crystalizes while cooling and gets harder than concrete . You can soften it again using natrium persulfate , but this causes tremendeous heat in the cuvette and you have to watch the temperature closely so the cuvette wo n't burst . <p> Even using the prescribed max. temperature the temperature distribution is not equal all over the cuvette . Using an aquarium heater the problem arises already right there . <p> As for the disposal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucket and put it aside to have the water evaporate in the air . When it was dry I used take it to the hazardous goods garbage disposal . ( Charge is on weight ! ) <p> The only advantage I see is the fact that Ammonium Persulfate is rather clear , you can observe the process of etching and apply corrections if etching is not equal on the board . <p> Anyway , I returned to the " brown water " . Results are fairly good at room temperature ( Thailand : 35deg/C + ) . Since there is no such thing as a hazardous garbage authority nobody cares where you dispose it off . I prefer " Khlongs " ( flood control system for the rainy season ) . There are thousands of them all over the country and may be the poison reduces the birth rate of mosquitos . <p> I feel , yes slowly it will work , but at least it wo n't over-etch into the carbon coated areas , and perhaps it could be fastened by slightly increasing the temperature of the solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dilute etchant for the unmasked areas . In reality , that probably is not the case . It is just that over etching occurs more rapidly with a faster solution . Subjectively , my best etchings have been done with a relatively rapid etch rather than a slow one . <p> If one were to use a mask that was slightly soluble in the etchant , say those who use ink jet printers and bake the image before etching , the length of time exposed to the aqueous etchant , not the concentration of ferric chloride or persulfate , may be more important for controlling selectivity . John <p> I just put a couple of teaspoons of Ammonium Persulphate in a Chinese takeaway container and add some boiling water from the kettle . Float the board on top and 5 minutes later its etched . As for disposal , I just throw it in the pool .

@@71811983 @511983/ 77978 @qwx697978 <p> The L293D is a quad half H-bridge chip which means you can make 2 complete H-bridges out of it . Perfect for bipolar stepper motors . I assume when you compare it to a normal H-bridge , you are talking about discrete components . The advantage of the L293D is it will be much easier to hook up . The advantage of a discrete solution is you can configure it to handle just about any amount of power you need . <p> your question is like asking " what 's the difference between an automobile and an Audi 4000 " . <p> First off , you need to give more complete information . You say " the H-bridge " . is there a specific one you are looking at in addition to the L293D ? also , the motor current is a huge factor in selecting an H-bridge ( or building one from scratch ) - you really need to know it before going any farther . <p> I suggest the first thing to do is get datasheets for all the chips you are looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one you should learn . <p> when you know the motor current , you can determine if a specific H-bridge is appropriate .

It 's just that the datasheet seems to make it so much more complicated to hook up when you know how simple the H-bridge is . They also tend to be too low current , have a crummy/ackward/unwieldly control scheme , and too many useless features which all make it more complicated to hook up while getting nothing in return .

First it does n't move , then it takes off like a shot , and the poor PWM drops pulses to try and compensate . <p> The motor inductance keeps the current flowing when the switch is turned off . Unless there is a high speed diode across the motor or across every element in the bridge you WILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backspikes and freewheeling diodes are something any halfway decent engineer knows about , there 's an element you failed to mention that really separates the men from the boys . Open up any good brush type motor made in the last ten years . See that little ring in there ? The one the coils are soldered to ? That 's an MOV . It 's in there to increase brush life . Kills the arc before it gets to the brushes . <p> Not that I would ever design a motor drive without backspike diodes , or trust the driver 's substrate diodes to do the job . <p> As to your stall/too fast problem , it sounds like you are using an open loop PWM instead of a regulator . Ideal motor speed is directly proportional to motor voltage . 77968 @qwx697968 <p> You 've now totally changed the thread - we 're all talking about PWM control , and you 're talking about feedback control - this could explain why your point of view is totally different to everyone elses . <p> You 've now totally changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you 're talking about feedback control - this could explain why your point of view is totally different to everyone elses. 77968 @qwx697968 <p> No it is still PWM . The only difference is that I am talking about closed loop PWM instead of open loop PWM . <p> BTW a PID loop IS a closed loop PWM system .

And I can also use a larger range ( duty cycle ) at lower frequency . At 400 Hz The range is 30-254.

The rpm is not constant . Like you can see the frequency in the turns . All frequencies below 20kHz are not ideal eighter , do my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure neighter a good idea .

The unit for conductance is the mho ( siemens ) , pronounced " moe .

It is a contraction of " transfer conductance " . Conductance is the flow of a current through two points when a voltage is applied as in a resistor , conductance being the reciprocal of resistance . In contrast , transconductance is the control of a current through two output points by a voltage at two input points , as if the conductance is transferred from the input points to the output points . When referring to a value , it is the ratio between these changes in voltage and current , and is written as gm : <p> In the world of vacuum tubes , transconductance is the change in the plate(anode)/cathode current divided by the corresponding change in the grid/cathode voltage , with a constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuum tube are 1 to 10 millisiemens . <p> Similarly , in field effect transistors , transconductance is the change in the drain/source current divided by the change in the gate/drain voltage with a constant drain/source voltage .

It is designed for extremely high current , high horsepower , and low duty cycle . <p> The current will depend on the type of car it came off of and the load that is put on it . <p> The current can run anywhere from 150 amps to 300 amps or more . the horsepower for these motors can be anywhere from 25 to 100 . This may seem like a lot of horsepower and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low . running for 10 seconds may require as much as 10 to 15 minutes to cooldown. although most people do n't realize that . <p> These motors are made with bushings no bearings , some of them do n't even have that . A lot of them is just steel on steel . <p> Any prolonged use of these motors such as in a BOT would be very disappointing . <p> Also you have to contend with a starter Bendix. a specialty gear that only runs in one direction it would have to be removed and replaced with something else . normally the shaft that the Bendix rides on has a special spiral spline . You would have to have a lathe to remove this . <p> Hello , I agree with Sam in the first part , but I think that there must be an error in the HP calculation : ( 300A x 12V ) / 745W/HP x .75eff= 3.6 HP . <p> There are two kind of starters with respect to the field : With a permanent magnet and with a coil . The first type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . <p> Anyway , this kind of motor , as said by Sam , is not appropiate for a long period of use , instead , I suggest you to use a generator or dynamo , used in old cars , before the use of alternators . If you get a six volts one ( very difficult ) , this is your motor , reversible and continous duty , and if you vary the field current , you can vary the speed . At 12 volts a 6 volt generator will spin a ( aprox ) 300 RPM . Try it and good luck . <p> Well Sam , I 'm sorry but you are way of . A starter for a normal car is between 0.8 and 1.2 HP . If you go for a big truck ( 12 litre diesel engine ) the starter put out around 25 HP . I do n't know where you got your figures from , but they are not correct . <p> First of all you your right my figures were a little high but considering there 's no real rating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge it would be a little difficult to quote an actual horsepower rating . I was simply trying to make a point that they would not be suitable for any other use . Also you ca n't use the same math with starter motors that you use with standard motors , it does n't work because of the way the motor is made internally and its intended use . A normal motor is designed to be used for extended period of time at a certain load and RPM . These motors or designed to basically self-destruct . <p> As far as reversing starter motors yes , it 's easier to reverse motors with permanent magnets than motors with a coil . In order to reverse a motor with a coil you must either reverse the polarity of the Armature or stater but not both . Because you can not change the polarity of a permanent magnet , all you would have to do is change the polarity to the motor itself . <p> A dynamo or generator can be used as a motor but because of the brush alignment they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current draw of these motors versus the power they would produce would probably make them unsuitable for your use . <p> Even on alternator can be used as a motor if you want to do some Elaborate electronics to support it . An alternator woodwork much like a stepping motor . Of course you would have to strip the diodes and regulator out first . <p> Why do n't you try going to some of the surplus stores on the Internet such as ( www.surpluscenter.com ) or even ( eBay ) you might find what you need their for the right price . and I 'm sure there is plenty of other places as well . <p> my point is it is morally better to spend an extra $5 or $10 on the right part then trying to make the wrong part work and maybe going through several different parts before you get one to work . <p> Hello , Sam , math is just one , I used your numbers to calculate the highest power output with the higher current that you stated . Normally it is half than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial static friction and inertia conditions have been overcomed . Anyway you may see some HP specifications on automotive starters at : http : **36;1851;TOOLONG <p> Dstich , some 25 years ago , I build a electric gocart using a Ford 6 volt generator , a 6 to 1 reduction , 20cm wheels and a 12V 70Ah battery enough to 4 hours of fun for my 8 years old kids with power enough to spin the wheels when fed without a 0.06 ohm 50W limiting resistor and about 20 KPH . <p> I agree with Sam that efficience is not very high , but may be enough to have a pleasent ride , without using sofisticated motors and electronics to drive them . <p> These Castle Auto Hi Torque starters are non-standard and 20-50% higher powered . And remember the power get out from your starter is not even close to the power it consumes . A modified old dynamo is a much better alternative ; it has bearings and is easier to run in both directions . There was a kind of combination way back called dynostarter , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fan belt and used on small boat motors and some farming equipment . Do n't try an alternator for this ! Good Luck ! <p> I agree with Sam , the car starter really is not meant for long times of usage , and will over heat in 20-30 seconds . I am just starting to builld an electric go kart , and I have decided to use a 6-12 volt generator , and one or two 12 volt motercycle batterys . But anyways , a 6 volt generator will work fine for a BOT , and should n't be too hard to find on the web or at a store in town . <p> oops , I did it again for like the fith time . Hey , do you know how to make an electric switch that switches the polarity of a battery so a moter spins backwards ? I already made one that works , but I did n't go very far with it yet . <p> Hi is it possible to turn a generator into a starter motor , I am rebuilding a 1942 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her to kick it over to start it has an old chain drive generator/magneto setup on it already can such a thing be made <p> It 's normally quite easy to turn a dynamo into a motor . However , I very much doubt that the dynamo would have enough torque to start the engine . Car starter motors are geared down to increase the torque . Most will only get the engine up to about 200 rpm because of that gearing . If your bike has a decompressor there is more chance . <p> A dynamo with brushes that generates DC will run as a motor if the field and armature windings are connected to a battery . However alternators , including the ones that directly power the lights without a battery , would be just about impossible to get to run as a motor . <p> Thanks for the reply , yes the engine has a decompression lever I have thought along these lines it would be the only way to rotate the engine because of the high compression in a big 500cc single , will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side as it fits to the engine or the inturnals
